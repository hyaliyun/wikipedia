Throughout the vessel's troubled past, she was involved in more than a dozen major shipping incidents including two other groundings; once in Indonesia while named Permina Samudra III, and again in Sicily while named Vari; and a collision in Japan. Because of her checkered career and sinking, Argo Merchant was featured in the \\"worst ship\\" category in the 1979 publication, The Book of Heroic Failures. 1976 shipwreck In December 1976, Argo Merchant loaded with of No. 6 fuel oil at Puerto La Cruz, Venezuela, sailing for Boston under Captain Georgios Papadopoulos. It was later established that the ship carried two unqualified crew as helmsmen, a broken gyrocompass, inadequate charts, and an inaccurate radio direction finder. At 6 p.m. on 15 December in high winds and seas, the tanker ran aground on Middle Rip Shoal about southeast of Nantucket and more than off her intended course. The thirty-eight members of the crew were evacuated, but the shallow waters and weather conditions made it impossible to offload the oil or salvage the ship. On 21 December 1976, Argo Merchant broke apart and emptied its entire cargo of fuel oil, enough to heat 18,000 homes for a year. Northwesterly winds blew the oil slick offshore, and coastal fisheries and beaches were spared the worst.

Hayford and Robert Stearns through their organization \\"Eagles Wings\\". They annually invite people around the world to pray for Jerusalem on the first Sunday of every October, close to the time of Yom Kippur. The first prayer meeting organized by this group occurred in 2004. Hayford and Stearns organize the primary meeting in Israel. According to a CBN interview with Stearns, he believes that prayer meetings are important to combat various dangers to the Judeo-Christian worldview, such as secular humanism and Radical Islam, and he believes that Christians are especially obligated to support the State of Israel. People praying for the peace of Jerusalem  International participation  According to \\"Jerusalem Newswire\\" a small independent Christian publication, organizers of the 2006 event claimed that they had scheduled prayer meetings to be held in 150,000 churches around the world. The coordinators scheduled for prayer meetings to be organized in 169 nations. In 2004, 500 global Christian ministries representing 50 countries and 53,000 churches said prayers for peace in Jerusalem on the same day. The organization's goal in 2006 was to have over 100 million people in over 100 countries participate in prayer meetings. The prayer meeting in Jerusalem in 2006 was held inside the gates of the Old City of Jerusalem and was attended by \\"hundreds of Christian lovers of Israel gathered with Jewish friends.\\" International denominations Assemblies of God, and Elim Fellowship took part in the 2006 prayer and support the annual prayers.  Endorsements  According to a press release issued by the Knesset Christian Allies Caucus, the Day of Prayer for the Peace of Jerusalem was originally established in cooperation with Israel's Ministry of Tourism, and the Christian Allies Caucus of the Knesset. The event is endorsed by chief rabbi Yona Metzger, former USSR Prisoner of Zion and Knesset Member Natan Sharansky, chairman of the Knesset Christian Allies Caucus (KCAC), Yuri Shtern, and the Deputy Mayor of Jerusalem, Yigal Amedi and the Knesset Christian Allies Caucus. Other participants are Christian evangelists, authors and performers such as Joyce Meyer, The Newsboys , Bishop TD Jakes, Michael W. Smith, and Kenneth Copeland.\\"Eagles Wings: More Leaders\\" Continuation of Promotional Page on the website for The Day of Prayer for the Peace of Jerusalem  Precursor  The first globally publicized \\"link of prayer\\" for peace from Jerusalem was the \\"World Prayer for Peace from Jerusalem\\" in June, 1993 organized by Dan Mazar's Jerusalem Christian Review, a Jerusalem-based archaeological journal. As opposed to the more exclusively Evangelical Christian event, this event included more than 100 Christian and political leaders from a wide range of backgrounds and from around the world. Hosted by Jerusalem Christian Review Managing Editor Dan Mazar, parts of the Global Prayer were also shown on the CNN, CBS, and ABC television networks and almost 120 other television stations worldwide. The Prayer Link began from Los Angeles, California with a prayer from the former U.S. President, Ronald Reagan: \\"I join my friends at the Jerusalem Christian Review... for this very special day. A day dedicated to prayer...\\" said the former US president and governor of the State of California. The \\"prayer link\\" also included prayers of political figures live by satellite from 5 continents. Leaders such as Jack Kemp, Jeane Kirkpatrick and numerous U.S. Senators, as well as former Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke all prayed for the \\"Peace of Jerusalem\\". Also included were Christian evangelists Billy Graham, Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell and James Dobson, along with denominational leaders from Europe, Africa, South America and Asia.World Link of Prayer: Christianity Today Magazine, September 1993; Associated Press Wire Service, July 3, 1993.

The municipality is strongly characterized by winegrowing. The many wineries and Strau√üwirtschaften invite visitors to come and enjoy the wine. Since 1972, Bodenheim has been the seat of the Verbandsgemeinde of Bodenheim, a kind of collective municipality. History In 754, Bodenheim had its first documentary mention, and it marked its 1,250-year jubilee in 2004. On 29 June 1988, two US F-16C combat aircraft collided near the municipality and fell over an uninhabited area.

Mayor Since 2009, the mayor has been Thomas Becker-Theilig (SPD). Coat of arms The municipality's arms might be described thus: Azure on a base sable an ass repassant argent, his head over a manger Or, to sinister thereof a vase with double handles of the same issuant from which a palm frond embowed to dexter vert. According to legend, the Provost of Saint Alban's Abbey in Mainz, to which Bodenheim then belonged, demanded of the Emperor minting rights. The Emperor, though, mocked him, saying ‚ÄúHe wants to mint coins, does he? An old ass shall he mint!‚Äù (in German: ‚ÄúM√ºnzen will Er pr√§gen? Einen alten Esel soll Er m√ºnzen!‚Äù). With great irony, however, the ass was later chosen as a charge for the coat of arms.

It is a hall church with barrel vaulting with a west tower, square quire and apse. The painting and stucco date from 1910. *Evangelical Church :The foundation stone for the Evangelical Church in Bodenheim was laid on 16 May 1887. Master builder Baron von Schmitt, who was also given the job of restoring Saint Catherine‚Äôs Church (Katharinenkirche) in Oppenheim, drew up plans for the church while master church builder Otto Schwarze took on the job of overseeing the building work. In the Gothic Revival style there arose a house of worship built out of quarried limestone blocks with a slated hip roof and a decorative fl√®che. Inside the building are found, among other things, three stained-glass windows in the quire showing Christ‚Äôs birth, Crucifixion and Resurrection, and the artistically carved pulpit, which is borne by the Four Evangelists. On 26 September 1888 came the church‚Äôs festive consecration. Today the Evangelical Church is open all week from 8:00 to 19:00 for devotions and sightseeing. *Kapelle Maria-Oberndorf :The Gothic Revival Marian pilgrimage chapel of Maria-Oberndorf arose in the years 1889-1891 according episcopal cathedral master builder Lukas‚Äôs plans. The first documentary mention of a church building on this same spot comes from 1217, although its beginnings are believed to be older. This first church building was destroyed in the Thirty Years' War. The pilgrimage festival is held yearly on the first Sunday after 2 July (Visitation) and is part of the Bishopric of Mainz pilgrimage calendar. *Historic Town Hall :Without a doubt, the municipality‚Äôs centrepiece is the Town Hall, which the knightly monastery had built in 1608 as a new courthouse (for the higher and village court). The two-floor building with a gabled roof and lovely indoor stucco work is typical of Franconian-Hessian timber-frame construction of the Renaissance after 1555. The massively built ground floor was originally an open hall with a round-arch opening (remnants were brought to light in 1968). The in parts ‚Äúdisordered‚Äù timber-frame structure over the entrance suggests that there was once an outdoor stairway up to the first floor. All cornerposts, the odd slanted beam, various crossbeams and the whole oriel are covered in vine and grape carvings, mouldings and grotesque faces. On a windowpost facing the Rhine, the names of the Schulthei√ü (roughly ‚Äúsheriff‚Äù) and the Sch√∂ffen (roughly ‚Äúlay jurists‚Äù) in the year when the Town Hall was built can still be made out. Sport *L√§ndlicher Reit- und Fahrverein Bodenheim e.V. :The riding club, founded in 1973, has in the last few years experienced a great upswing. By expanding the club‚Äôs own sport facilities (2 riding halls 20 √ó 60 m und 20 √ó 40 m, 1 big showjumping square, 2 dressage squares, 4 tennis courts with clubhouse) and staging local and regional events it managed to broaden their offerings markedly.

They announced their split on 28 March 2008, with the band playing one final gig at Sheffield's Carling Academy on 24 May 2008 before reuniting in 2016. History Formation Milburn's formation came after years of friendship through playing football together. Joe Green started playing the drums and Tom and Louis Carnall both learned to play guitar. The three then decided to form a band, in which they would play cover versions of songs by bands they admired. However the band required a singer and bass player, so they encouraged Louis Carnall's younger brother Joe Carnall to join, despite him not knowing how to sing or play bass. It was a good idea. Milburn started out playing small gigs in front of friends, practising at drummer Joe Green's grandma's house. The origin of their name comes from a bet with a friend whose surname was Milburn. Emergence and debut album (2001‚Äì2006) The band released their first demo in 2001, titled \\"Steel Town\\". The demo was handed out at gigs and to anyone interested in listening. The demo's artwork was simply the band's name in front of the colours blue and white, representing their love for local football team Sheffield Wednesday. The demo contained three tracks, \\"Steel Town\\", \\"High & Dry\\" and \\"Tommy\\". In 2002 Milburn sold out the Boardwalk in Sheffield twice and played at The Cavern Club in Liverpool, The Garage in London and The Leadmill in Sheffield, while supporting Tony Wright's band Laika Dog and Cosmic Rough Riders. After releasing two limited singles, \\"Lipstick Lickin\\" and \\"Showroom\\", on their own label Free Construction, Milburn signed to Mercury Records in 2006. Their debut single for the label, \\"Send In the Boys\\", reached number 22 in the UK Singles Chart in April 2006, and their debut album, Well Well Well, released on 9 October 2006 on Mercury Records reached number 32 in the UK Albums Chart. These Are the Facts (2007‚Äì2008) Joe Carnall Tom Rowley Milburn released their second album These Are the Facts on 24 September 2007, preceded by the first single from the album \\"What Will You Do (When the Money Goes)?\\" on 17 September. Milburn promoted These Are the Facts with an initial UK tour in September 2007 then another tour in November 2007. As part of the November 2007 tour, the gig at Manchester Metropolitan University's K2 was cancelled halfway through after the venue failed to hire a sufficient crowd barrier. This resulted in uncontrollable surges by the crowd, which culminated in an alleged attack on a fan by an event security attendant who then turned on Louis Carnall. Break- up (2008‚Äì2016) Milburn announced on 28 March 2008 that, after much consideration, they had decided it was time to call it a day. They said there had been no falling out in the band and they still remained friends and supporters of each other as they explore new musical horizons. The band played two final gigs, at the ABC Glasgow on 22 May and the Carling Academy Sheffield on 24 May 2008 as well as releasing two outtakes from These Are the Facts, \\"The District Line\\" and \\"Stay at Home\\". Reunion shows and third album (2016‚Äìpresent) The band reunited in April 2016 for four shows at the O2 Academy Sheffield to celebrate ten years since the release of Well Well Well. The success of the shows led to the band announcing an Autumn UK tour, as well as a new single. The \\"Midnight Control / Forming of a Fate\\" double A-side was released in September 2016. The single was recorded at Parr St. Studios, Liverpool, under producer Bill Ryder-Jones. The band continued to work with Ryder-Jones, completing an album on 26 January 2017. The band released their third album Time on 29 September 2017 via the band's own label \\"count to 10 Records\\" and PledgeMusic. The album which was recorded in Liverpool with Bill Ryder Jones. Side-projects After the split, Louis Carnall became a member of Lords of Flatbush with ex-Arctic Monkeys bassist Andy Nicholson and Sheffield based singer Steve Edwards, however he is no longer a member. Tom Rowley and Joe Green became members of The Backhanded Compliments and remain in the band's current incarnation Dead Sons. In January 2009 Tom Rowley joined Reverend and the Makers, replacing Tom Jarvis on guitar but subsequently left to concentrate on Dead Sons. In 2013 he also joined Arctic Monkeys as a touring member. In 2009, Joe Carnall started his own band with ex-Arctic Monkeys bassist Andy Nicholson initially called Joe Carnall and the Book Club (subsequently renamed simply The Book Club) and in January 2012 he also joined Reverend and the Makers. In addition, he also performs as Joe Carnall & Friends in which he and a revolving group of friends from bands such as The Book Club, Milburn and Reverend and the Makers play mostly acoustic versions of songs by both The Book Club and Milburn as well as performing covers of other well known songs. The Joe Carnall & Friends shows sell out weeks in advance and the Christmas 2013 show sold out the original venue in just 28 minutes and had to be upgraded to The Leadmill to cope with demand. In 2019, Joe Carnall released his first solo album, under the name Good Cop Bad Cop, the self titled debut was produced by Arctic Monkeys drummer Matt Helders.

It has a population of 3,807 and an area of 7.62 km¬≤. Haus-Knipp- Bridge.In the background the red pillars of the A42-Bridge can be seen. History Until the Middle Ages, Beeckerwerth was surrounded by water on all sides: on the west and northwest by the Rhine, on the east and northeast by the Emscher and on the south by a branch of the Emscher called the Monnarde. This is the origin of the name of Beeckerwerth which means \\"Island of Beeck\\" in Old German. The house of Beeck ruled over Beeckerwerth since the 13th century. Their castle, Haus Knipp, was first mentioned in 1292. It served as their court until its destruction in 1571. It was rebuilt further inland in 1620. Beeckerwerth became a borough of Duisburg on 1 October 1905, together with Beeck, Laar and Ruhrort. The industrialist August Thyssen purchased most of Beeckerwerth, including Haus Knipp, in the early 20th century. Haus Knipp was destroyed in 1939 when the dam was extended. The Haus-Knipp-Railroad- Bridge, which was constructed next to it in 1912, still bears its name. The bridge was destroyed during the Second World War and repaired by British army engineers in 1946.

It is the seat of the Verbandsgemeinde of Gau-Algesheim, a kind of collective municipality.  Geography   Location  Gau-Algesheim lies roughly 20 km west of Mainz and just under 3 km away from the Rhine on the edge of the Ingelheimer Rheinebene (‚ÄúIngelheim Rhine Plain‚Äù) on the terraces at the Rhenish Hesse West Plateau, into whose varied soil structure the ‚ÄúGeo-Ecological Teaching Path‚Äù on the Westerberg slopes allows a glimpse. Through the municipal area flows the Welzbach.  Neighbouring municipalities  Clockwise from the north, these are Ingelheim, Appenheim, Ockenheim and Bingen.  Constituent communities  Gau-Algesheim's Stadtteile are Gau-Algesheim and Laurenziberg.  History  In Roman times this was a border area, but already by the Middle Ages it had grown into part of the Holy Roman Empire‚Äôs heartland. Before the town‚Äôs first documentary mention in the Lorsch codex in 766, Alagastesheim may already have had more than two centuries of history behind it. The documents about Alagastesheim and Bergen (Laurenziberg) in the lists of holdings from the Lorsch and Fulda Abbeys beginning in 766-767 allow inferences about cropraising, livestock raising, winegrowing, fruitgrowing and individual inhabitants‚Äô wealth. Gau-Algesheim came to the fore in history along with all the other places in the Binger Land with the ‚Ä≥Verona Donation‚Ä≥ on 14 June 983, when Emperor Otto II donated to his Archchancellor Willigis in Verona the town of Bingen and the land ‚Äúthat stretches this side of the Rhine from the bridge over the Selzbach as far as Heimbach, beyond the Rhine but from the spot where the Elzb√§chlein (a small stream) flows into the same, as far as the little village of Caub‚Äù.  Middle Ages  Under financial pressure, Gau-Algesheim was pledged to the Baden Margraves. The Margrave himself then further pledged it in 1461, and the villages of Dromersheim, Gau-Bickelheim, Ockenheim, Windesheim, Kempten, M√ºnster and B√ºdesheim to the financially strong Count Philipp I, Count of Katzenelnbogen. Under him, the term Wein vom Gau, meaning ‚ÄúWine from the Gau (or Region)‚Äù, was coined. As Philipp died in 1479 without a male heir, Gau-Algesheim ended up involved in the Katzenelnbogen succession dispute. ‚ÄúLiving well under the crozier‚Äù was not something that held true at all times. Often domestic or foreign armies would sweep through the town bringing war's attendant burdens and havoc, for instance, in 1248 during the struggles between Emperor Frederick II's and King William II's troops, in 1553 in the war of Protestant princely opposition to Emperor Charles V, in 1631 when Swedish King Gustav II Adolf's troops burnt much of the town down, or 1690, 1733 and 1792, when French soldiers burnt or seized Gau-Algesheim. H√∂chst am Main) Even the two conferrals of town rights, the one in 1332 at Elector of Mainz Baldwin of Luxembourg's request by Emperor Louis the Bavarian and the one in 1355 by King Charles IV in support of the Archbishop of Mainz, were primarily motivated by political and military considerations and were only secondarily meant to further the towsfolk's security and well-being. Nevertheless, there arose a weekly market and a wine market along with a healthy number of craftsmen and businessmen with the urban life then creating supply and demand for regular markets. At the same time, a great many financial pledges and the mention of a Jewish head tax point to rather a high demand for cash and business. Eventually, for over 400 years, from the latter half of the 14th century until the end of the Old Empire, there arose the Amt of Algesheim under the governance of Amtm√§nner, Landschreiber, Amtskeller (all titles for various officials) and Schulthei√üen (roughly ‚Äúsheriffs‚Äù) of the Mainz overlords. The overlords‚Äô might, already demonstrated in the municipal law of 15 July 1417, was keenly felt by Gau-Algesheim when Elector Albrecht of Brandenburg put an end to efforts to secure self-administration for the town by issuing the state law of 3 January 1527 because the town had taken part in the ‚ÄúRheingau Uprising‚Äù in 1525, and released ‚Äúunser stadt Alge√üheym von unserm landt dem Ringgaw‚Äù (‚Äúour town Algesheim from our land, the Rheingau‚Äù, in archaic German), cutting the town off from the Rheingau, supposedly in perpetuity. Alongside this, pictures of the town, cadastral plans and village descriptions from cartographer Gottfried Mascop's 1577 atlas, the 1590 and 1668 village descriptions and the 1595 Police Law give impressions of the extent to which, and within what bounds of administrative structures the small farming town's social and economic life, and also the townsfolk's self- awareness and self-will developed.  French Revolution and the years that followed  From 1797 to 1815, Gau-Algesheim, along with the whole of the territory on the Rhine's left bank, belonged to the French Republic or the Napoleonic Empire. In the person of scientist, engineer and officer Rudolf Eickemeyer, who was from 1811 to 1813 and again from 1814 to 1815 the maire and from 1815 to 1822 the B√ºrgermeister (‚Äúmayor‚Äù in French and German respectively), Gau-Algesheim had a personal continuity from the time of French rule on into Hessian times. Eickemeyer gave the community a modern shape by reforming fire control, restructuring finances, expanding the town's building work, and furthering schooling and agriculture. The town's growing importance found expression in the institution of a notary's office (1809), the building of the Ludwigsbahn (Mainz-Bingen railway) with a station (1859), the building of a postal depot (1861) out of which grew postal shipping and a post office, and in Georg Presser's (1862) and the Avenarius Brothers‚Äô (1869) first factories. The traces left in Gau-Algesheim by the Catholic priest Peter Koser from 1869 to 1890 are still apparent today. The Rheinischer Volksbote (‚ÄúRhenish Messenger‚Äù), first published by the printer Reidel in 1869 and under Father Koser's editorship, was for decades a regionally important organ of the Catholic Centre Party. A teacher preparation institute (an institution that prepared students for teacher's college), known to locals as the Lateinschul (‚ÄúLatin School‚Äù) or the Aljesemer Hochschul (‚ÄúAlgesheim College‚Äù, in dialectal German), a childcare centre, a credit and savings union on a co√∂perative basis, a farmers‚Äô and consumers‚Äô association, and not least of all the newly built Catholic parish church and the establishment of church music in 1888 confirm Peter Koser's religious and sociopolitical contributions in a time of political and ideological struggles.  Third Reich  In the 5 March 1933 Reichstag elections, the town's Catholic character showed itself once again with the Centre Party holding its own as the strongest party with 46.6% of the vote, against the National Socialists with 26.6%. The SPD and the Communists trailed rather badly with 16.2% and 6.9% respectively. After the dissolution or banning of democratic political parties and ecclesiastical associations, and the Gleichschaltung of clubs, opponents of National Socialism were progressively isolated and intimidated. In the context of the dispute over the Reichskonkordat between the German Empire and the Roman Curia, members of the Centre, and also two Social Democrats, were defamed as separatists and traitors to the Fatherland, resulting in their being delivered to Osthofen Concentration Camp. When the Second World War ended, the roughly 80 dead and missing from the First World War were joined by a further 200 or so dead, murdered and missing.  Since the war  Schloss Ardeck The 600th anniversary of Gau-Algesheim's elevation to town in 1355 was recalled by a days-long festival in the summer of 1955, which formed the high point, and indeed the completion of the phase of reconstruction and restoration of traditional structures. Within a few years, the roadbridge (Bundesstra√üe 41) over the railway line (1957), the cycling sport hall (1960), the new Catholic kindergarten (1961) and the expansion of the Albertus-Hospital (1962) and the primary school (1963) changed the town's face. Once the town administration had moved from the Town Hall on the marketplace to Schloss Ardeck (castle) in 1969, the results of administrative reform made themselves known, among which were the Regierungsbezirk of Rheinhessen-Pfalz (1968), the Mainz-Bingen district (1969) and the Verbandsgemeinde of Gau-Algesheim (1972) as well as the new Schloss-Ardeck-Grundschule (primary school, 1979), the Schloss-Ardeck- Sporthalle (1981) and the Christian Erbach Regional School (2003). Life in the many clubs and the conviviality are anchored in an historical foundation: in the traditional festivals, the pilgrimage on the Laurenziberg on the Sunday after Saint Lawrence's Day (10 August), the kermis (church consecration festival, locally known as the Kerb) around Assumption Day (15 August), the Young Wine Festival on the second weekend in October and the Christmas Market on the first Sunday in Advent.  Politics   Town partnerships  * Saulieu, C√¥te-d'Or, France * Caprino Veronese, Province of Verona, Veneto, Italy * Redford, Michigan, USA * Neudietendorf, Gotha district, Thuringia * Erfurt-Stotternheim, Thuringia The partnerships began in 1964 with Saulieu. After both places‚Äô mayors had met, a group of Catholic youths (from the Katholische Junge Gemeinde) travelled to a campground in Burgundy. The links with Caprino Veronese, Redford, Neudietendorf and Stotternheim, too, began with contacts by individual persons or groups before there was ever official contact, much less formal ties. For its dedication to nurturing town partnerships, Gau-Algesheim was awarded the Europe Diploma in 1994 by the Council of Europe, and the European Flag of Honour in 1995. In 2002, the many stresses on the town and its inhabitants were greatly eased by state recognition of the town as a Tourism Municipality (Fremdenverkehrsgemeinde).  Coat of arms  The town's arms might be described thus: Gules a cross crosslet patt√©e couped top and bottom by a wheel in each of chief and base spoked of six lozengy argent. The arms are derived from those borne by Mainz, which is explained by an historical connection. Gau-Algesheim was an Archbishopric of Mainz holding until 1803. The arms were conferred in 1853, at least officially. The wheel-and-cross composition had, however, been appearing in town seals since at least the 15th century.Description and explanation of Gau-Algesheim‚Äôs arms  Economy and infrastructure  Langgasse Parish church The town lies in a favourable location for transport on the Left Rhine railway towards Frankfurt, Koblenz, and Mainz and the line to Bad Kreuznach, which connects to the Nahe Valley line to Saarbr√ºcken and on Autobahn A 60\\\\.

It starred Shia LaBeouf, Elden Henson, Kathleen Quinlan, Amy Smart, and Shiri Appleby. The film was the winning script for the second season of Project Greenlight. Plot Kelly Ernswiler, a young war reenactment enthusiast, works at his local store with love interest Sarah and Bart Bowland. Kelly's father, Abe, works with drug addicts, being clean himself for over five years. His mother, Eve, is a commercial artist. Kelly attempts to woo Bart's older sister, Tabby, even though she's set to marry Miner Weber, a handsome businessman. Kelly becomes a regular at Bart's house, being over for dinner often, and he impresses Bart's father, Harrison, with their common fondness for war memorabilia, and Bart's mother by complimenting her on her flowers, and he often talks to Tabby in her workshop. During this time, Sarah asks him to go to an Aerosmith concert, which she has a spare ticket for, telling him it would be good for him to get out more. When he bluntly makes it clear that he knows it would be a date, he tells her he is seeing someone else, obviously meaning Tabby. Before Kelly and Bart perform their plan for Lance's humiliation, Bart makes it clear to Kelly that he knows he has \\"his own agenda\\", at which Kelly is insulted and angry, and Bart displaces it as \\"pre-mission nervous energy\\". They recreate an invasion on the street where Lance lives and drag him out of the house pointing guns at him and shouting at him with German accents. They videotape the whole thing and he urinates out of fear. Afterwards, the boys are drinking whiskey at Bart's house and Bart passes out in a chair by the fire. Kelly makes to go home and goes to the workshop to say goodbye to Tabby. He walks in on her crying, as she now thinks the marriage will be off and goes to comfort her, and they kiss. As Kelly is leaving, Bart sees him and is furious as he knew he was in the workshop. The next day, as Kelly is on a set for a war program that Bart got them in, Bart hasn't turned up. Kelly is cast in a role to be a jeep driver and when his cue is called, Bart turns up out of the bushes and confronts him about Tabby. Kelly denies it at first and then becomes speechless. As he is about to drive for his cue, Bart attacks him in the jeep and they make a mess of the set. The next day, Abe is taken into care again for relapsing and Kelly is emotionless. He goes to the wedding the same day, only to have an annoyed Bart tell him that he can't let him in. He sneaks into Tabby's limo before it pulls in and he talks to her, and it is a moment in which he finally realizes he must grow up. He gets out of the car and everyone at the wedding sees him and are all confused. He goes round the back of the church to get his bike and leave and meets Minor again, who has no idea of what happened with Kelly and Tabby, and is civil towards him. Kelly cycles to the clinic where his father is staying and is surprised. They begin to watch television and his mother walks in and is surprised and happy to see Kelly. In the end, it shows the voicemail message where Kelly apologizes to the Bowlands for his behavior and asks Bart if he will meet him where he will be selling all his old memorabilia, and gives a hat Bart acquired for him back. He is shown walking down the street with Sarah and they hold hands. Kelly sees Lance again on his lawn where they faked the invasion, and goes over to him and confesses, only to be punched in the jaw. The film ends with Kelly lying on the lawn, holding his bruised jaw saying, \\"I deserved it\\". Filming Locations The film was shot in and around the greater Los Angeles region. Sites included the Los Angeles County Arboretum, Reseda and Santa Monica. No live action footage featuring the stars was filmed in Shaker Heights, Ohio.

It is located in French Township, Saint Louis County. Ecosystem Thirty-three species of wildlife inhabit the park including white-tailed deer, black bears, timber wolves, chipmunks, red squirrels, raccoons, and several species of reptiles and amphibians. More than 175 species of birds also visit the area. The park protects a northern boreal forest with stands of red and white pine and leatherleaf-black spruce lowlands. Geology The glaciers that moved through the area gouged and tore at the bedrock, the cooled lava of ancient volcanoes. During that period, glaciers flowed south, retreated north, and flowed south again. The first glacier stopped where McCarthy Beach is now located. It left low rolling hills with steep sides called moraines. Between the hills, the glaciers gouged valleys and in the larger valleys, lakes were formed.  History  In 1895, the Swan River Logging Company built a railroad to Sturgeon Lake. The railroad hauled logs to the Swan River where they were floated down the Mississippi River to Minneapolis sawmills. Over the years, the area became a popular picnic and tenting ground for people from the Iron Range. When the property owner John A. McCarthy died in 1943, his daughter sold the land to a lumberman. Local citizens became concerned about the fate of the timber and were able to persuade the new owner to sell the land. Locals raised some of the money to finance the sale. By matching local money with state money the land was purchased and became a state park in 1945.

Geography   Location  Guntersblum lies on the Rhine‚Äôs left bank between Mainz and Worms, right on the Mainz‚ÄìLudwigshafen railway line, and roughly 25 km south of Mainz. The municipality‚Äôs total area is 1 668 ha, 1 373 ha of which is given over to agriculture and forestry, and 550 ha of this is used for winegrowing. Winegrowing areas include Guntersblumer V√∂gelsg√§rten and Oppenheimer Kr√∂tenbrunnen while individual vineyards are Steinberg, Authental, Steigterassen, Bornpfad, Kreuzkapelle, Eiserne Hand, St. Julianenbrunnen and Sonnenhang.  History   9th to 10th century  Between 830 and 850 Guntersblum, had its first documentary mention as Chunteres Frumere in the Lorsch codex: a kingly bondsman had to pay the royal court interest in the form of two Fuder (very roughly, 2 000 L) of wine. On 13 June 897 came the municipality‚Äôs first datable documentary mention, this time under the name Cundheresprumare (‚ÄúGunter‚Äôs Plum Garden‚Äù). In this document, King Zwentibold confirmed to the monks at Saint Maximin's Abbey at Trier that they had holdings at their disposal in Guntersblum. Between 922 and 927, the Archbishop of Cologne endowed this monastery to the Holy Virgins and Saint Ursula‚Äôs Monastery in Cologne with holdings, among other things several arpents of fields in Guntersblum.  13th to 18th century  In 1215, the Xanten Monastery leased its income from the church at Guntersblum (yearly 12 Fuder of wine, 100 Malter of rye and 50 Malter of wheat) to the knight Herbord von Albig and his son Cuselin. In 1237, the Monastery sold the church patronage rights and the whole of its holdings in Guntersblum to the Worms Cathedral Monastery. The goods were shared between the brothers Friedrich III of Leiningen and Emich IV of Leiningen-Landeck. The latter acquired the Electoral-Cologne feudal estate in Guntersblum. Before 1242, Friedrich III of Leiningen was enfeoffed by the Archbishops of Cologne (the village‚Äôs owners) with the Vogtei over Guntersblum. Beginning then, Guntersblum remained under Leiningen lordship and belonged until 1316 to the House of Leiningen: :until 1466 to the House of Leiningen-Hardenburg. :until 1572 to the House of Leiningen-Dagsburg-Hardenburg. :until 1658 to the House of Leiningen-Dagsburg- Falkenburg (in Heidesheim). :until 1766 to the House of Leiningen-Dagsburg- Falkenburg in Guntersblum. :until 1787 to the House of Leiningen-Dagsburg- Hardenburg. :from 1787 to the House of Leiningen-Guntersblum. :late 1797 ‚Äì End of Leiningen lordship; Rhine‚Äôs left bank annexed to France.  19th century  In 1814 and 1815 came the Congress of Vienna and along with it, the end of French rule. In 1815 and 1816, the Province of Rhenish Hesse (Rheinhessen) came into being and was annexed to the Grand Duchy of Hesse, thereby making Guntersblum Hessian. In 1828 and 1829, work on straightening the Rhine was done, part of which involved the creation of the K√ºhkopf (‚ÄúCow‚Äôs Head‚Äù), an island, formerly joined to the left bank as the land inside an oxbow. In 1852, Guntersblum became part of the new Oppenheim district. In 1853, the Hessische Ludwigsbahn (railway) from Mainz to Worms was built.  20th century  In 1930, the last occupation troops from the First World War left Guntersblum. In March 1945, American tank units rolled through Rhenish Hesse and also Guntersblum. After the Second World War, Guntersblum grew in the course of the great economic upswing throughout Germany to more than double its former size. Given the way the Allied occupiers set their occupation zones up, the K√ºhkopf area became part of Hesse. In 1969, Guntersblum was made part of the newly formed Regierungsbezirk of Rheinhessen-Pfalz and, within that, part of the newly formed Mainz-Bingen district. In 1972, Guntersblum became the seat of the like-named Verbandsgemeinde, which merged into the Verbandsgemeinde Rhein- Selz in 2014.  Religion  = Evangelical parish = Evangelical church The church was built about 1100 as a three-naved basilica with two towers. Then, the Xanten Monastery owned the church patronage rights and made Saint Viktor the church's patron saint. In 1617 and 1618, the nave was torn down because it was in an ill state of repair. In 1619, new building work began. Owing to the Thirty Years' War, the work on the new church was not finished until sometime between 1685 and 1688. In 1702, the south tower fell down. Its replacement is the one with the clock, built between 1839 and 1842. Both the church's towers are particularly noteworthy. The style of such eight-sided vaults on a square foundation most likely originated in Persia and further developed in 7th-century Armenia. This ‚ÄúOriental relationship‚Äù has led to the towers being called the ‚ÄúSaracen Towers‚Äù. Towers in this style have only five representatives in Germany (compare Alsheim, Dittelsheim-He√üloch, St. Paulus (Worms), Wetzlar). Among the church's other peculiarities is the Gothic baptismal font. It is believed to date from about 1490 and is one of the so- called Lion Fonts (L√∂wentaufsteine). = Catholic parish, Saint Viktor‚Äôs = Catholic church For some 100 years, the two denominations shared a house of worship. Eventually the civic community helped the Catholics build their own ‚ÄúSaint Viktor‚Äôs Church‚Äù (Sankt Viktorskirche) in 1844 and 1845. The church building went up on land belonging to the parish across the street from the Town Hall. The festive consecration was undertaken by Bishop Petrus Leopold Kaiser from Mainz on 16 November 1845. The consecration document hangs in the church's sacristy. In July 1965, the parish priest was able to move into the parish-owned rectory across from the Catholic Church. In 1982 and 1983, the Catholic parish built itself a parish hall, to a great extent through its own means and donations, which Canon Fahney dedicated on 13 March 1983. The priest who has been leading the Guntersblum Catholic parish, Father Alphons Mohr, celebrated the 50th anniversary of his entry into the priesthood not long ago.  Politics   Coat of arms  The municipality's arms might be described thus: Per fess azure an eagle displayed argent armed, beaked and langued gules, and argent a flowerpot of the first issuant from which five roses of the third slipped vert. The eagle is the charge borne by the Counts of Leiningen. They held the village in fief for centuries and lived at the local castle. The roses are canting for part of the municipality's name (‚Äúflower‚Äù in German is Blume).Description and explanation of Guntersblum‚Äôs arms  Town partnerships  * Muldenstein, Anhalt-Bitterfeld, Saxony-Anhalt  Culture and sightseeing  Museums  Museum on the Kellerweg *Kelterhaus (‚ÄúWine Press House‚Äù, Kellerweg 20) from the 19th century, old building wing built in classical Gr√ºnderzeit style with imposing, wood-veneered and painted wine- tasting parlour from that time, last run as a restaurant and passing into municipal ownership in 2000.

The oldest cellar bears the date 1600. The midpoint on the Kellerweg forms the Julianenbrunnen (spring). Yearly since 1964, the municipality has been celebrating the Kellerweg-Fest on the last two weekends in August. Similar building complexes can also be found in Austria where they are called Kellergasse. *Waterworks pumphouse The pumping apparatus with a machine hall and a machinist's house was built in 1906 and 1907 by Wilhelm Lenz, Mainz Grand Ducal Education Inspector.

Economy and infrastructure   Transport  Guntersblum lies right on Bundesstra√üe 9, which runs along from Ludwigshafen am Rhein, parallel to the Mainz‚ÄìLudwigshafen railway line to Mainz. Guntersblum lies between two urban agglomerations, the Frankfurt Rhine Main Region and the Rhine Neckar Area. There are also railway links to these two metropolitan areas with half-hourly trains. In 2015, the RheinNeckar S-Bahn will begin running here. Furthermore, there are highway links to Autobahnen A 61 and A 63 through the Autobahn cross at Alzey, 25 km away. This is only worthwhile for driving towards Koblenz and Kaiserslautern, as Mainz, Worms and Ludwigshafen can be reached more quickly over the B 9\\\\.  Shopping  In Guntersblum are found several bakeries, butcher's shops, hairdressers, supermarkets and discount outlets. Also, many gastronomical businesses are on hand alongside the odd winery.  Education  The primary school named after the Guntersblumer Carl K√ºstner is attended by roughly 200 pupils. Within the school's property is also housed the folk high school. Furthermore, Guntersblum has two kindergartens, Spatzennest and Zwergenpalast (‚ÄúSparrow‚Äôs Nest‚Äù and ‚ÄúDwarfs‚Äô Palace‚Äù).

He \\"was widely considered the finest field birder / ornithologist that the world had ever seen.\\" Biography Parker grew up in Lancaster, Pennsylvania and became interested in birdwatching at an early age. In 1971 he broke the North American Big Year record (seeing more species of birds in a year than anyone before). In that year he enrolled at the University of Arizona and began to accompany ornithological expeditions to South America, particularly with Louisiana State University. He moved to Baton Rouge and was associated with LSU for the rest of his life (becoming a fanatical supporter of LSU basketball). He supported himself by leading birding tours, especially for Victor Emanuel Nature Tours, until the last few years of his life, when he went to work for Conservation International. Identification skills According to Zimmer (1993), \\"Voice, microhabitat, and behavior are the keys [to identification] in neotropical forests, and Ted was not only the first to recognize this (his seminal paper on foliage-gleaner identification that appeared in the April 1979 issue of Continental Birdlife should be required reading for all students of tropical birding), but also honed his discrimination of these essential cues to a finer degree than anyone else.\\" Zimmer adds that as knowledge of these matters was limited, \\"[m]any field problems‚Ä¶ took weeks of patient effort for Ted to work out for himself.\\" If another ornithologist played Parker a tape of an unknown bird, he could usually recognize it and could often identify other species in the background noise. He might then, by his knowledge of bird ranges, state where the tape had been made--Zimmer gives the example of \\"south bank of the Amazon between the Rios Madeira and Tapajos\\". He could identify bird calls and songs even in the presence of many other birds, as when the bird was a member of a mixed- species flock. On more than one occasion, he identified a bird new to him by its call, since he recognized the genus and knew what species lived in the area. Once, hearing a recording of a dawn chorus in Bolivia, he realized that one of the sounds was an antwren of the genus Herpsilochmus--but since he knew all the sounds of those birds, he knew he was hearing a previously unknown species. The following year, the new species was discovered. The scale of this knowledge is given by the presence of over two thousand bird species in the Andes and Amazon, where Parker did most of his field work; each species typically has at least three vocalizations. He kept them straight not only from each other but from the region's monkeys, amphibians, and insects as well. Methods Don Stap describes Parker's method: walking slowly down a trail, pausing after every step, and watching and listening. In this way he gained his knowledge of both detail and \\"common patterns in behavior or vocalizations or community structure across the continent\\", which led Jon Fjelds√• and Niels Krabbe to call him \\"by far the greatest specialist on the life histories of neotropical birds there ever was\\". Stap also notes that Parker generally did not shoot birds for study, a normal method of field ornithology. When leading tours, Parker would lure flocks in by recording their sounds as he heard them and then immediately playing the tape back; he would predict where the flock would come into sight and arrange his clients to give each a good view. The flock would appear as predicted. Contributions Parker willingly shared his knowledge with others informally, published extensively, and contributed over 10,000 recordings to the Macaulay Library of Natural Sounds at the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology. When he went to work for Conservation International, he conceived of an interdisciplinary program to provide scientific information in South America's conservation crises. This Rapid Assessment Program has led to the creation of many parks and reserves. Parker was doing a survey for it in western Ecuador when he was killed in a plane crash along with three others, including the botanist Alwyn Howard Gentry. The Theodore A. Parker III Natural Area in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, and the Parker/Gentry Award for Conservation Biology are named for him.

It is located in Fayetteville, Arkansas near the campus of the University of Arkansas, and serves as a cultural center for the Northwest Arkansas area. The building was opened in 1992 in large part because of funds donated by the Walton family (of Walmart). The center is host to many musicals, plays, and other artistic and educational events throughout the year.  History  The Walton Arts Center in May 2017 The idea for the Walton Arts Center started in the 1980s with a donation from Sam Walton to the University of Arkansas for the creation of a performance space. After talks with the city of Fayetteville who were also looking for a multi-purpose space for conferences and special events, the corner of Dickson Street and North School Avenue was chosen for being approximately halfway between downtown Fayetteville and the University. Finally in 1986 the Walton Arts Center Council was formed with the task of the construction of the facility. In 2009 Peter B. Lane was appointed the Center's third President/CEO. In 2013 the Arkansas Music Pavilion was relocated to the City of Rogers, AR In 2014 construction of Walmart Arkansas Music Pavilion was completed. and the City of Fayetteville h aeld groundbreaking ceremony of demolition of JOC for new parking deck. In 2016 a $23 Million renovation and expansion of the Walton Arts Center was completed. Resident Companies and Partner Organizations  The Walton Arts Center, in addition to presenting seasons of performance and visual arts exhibitions, also hosts several resident organizations who also produce and present arts and education programs. TheatreSquared was produced in Fayetteville, Arkansas and is nationally acclaimed, with their productions reaching 22,000 patrons each year. TheatreSquared is Northwest Arkansas's only year-round professional theatre and performs in the 175-seat theater at Walton Arts Center's Nadine Baum Studios. In 2011, TheatreSquared was recognized by the American Theatre Wing founder of the Tony Awards. As part of a $34 million capital campaign, the company recently broke ground on a 50,000 square-foot facility to be completed in mid-2019 that will include two venues, offices, artists' apartments, production workspaces, and a public cafe. SoNA the Symphony of Northwest Arkansas was founded in 2011, previously named North Arkansas Symphony in 1954.

Born in Lons-le-Saunier, R√©mond was the Secretary General of Jeunesses √©tudiantes Catholiques (JEC France in 1943) and a member of the International YCS Center of Documentation and Information in Paris (presently the International Secretariat of International Young Catholic Students). The author of books on French political, intellectual and religious history, he was elected to the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise in 1998. He was also a founding member of the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences. R√©mond is the originator of the famous division of French right-wing parties and movement into three different currents, each one of which appeared during a specific phase of French history: Legitimism (counter- revolutionaries), Orl√©anism, and Bonapartism. Boulangisme, for example, was according to him a type of Bonapartism, as was Gaullism. These he considers as being authoritarian, needing a leader with charisma, and presenting their movements as more \\"populist\\" than the others. Legitimism refers to the royalists who refused to accept the French Republic during the 19th century. (The Action Fran√ßaise royalist movement belongs to the Legitimists, who, being marginalized during the 20th century, managed however to take back some influence during the Vichy r√©gime.) Similarly, he classes the National Front (Le Pen's party) in this group. Orl√©anists he identifies as economic liberals, which characterizes present-day conservative parties. This group presents itself as bourgeois rather than populist.

Until 5 November 2006 it was an Ortsgemeinde ‚Äì a municipality belonging to a Verbandsgemeinde, a kind of collective municipality ‚Äì but it was raised to town the next day.Pressedienst der Landesregierung: \\"Nieder-Olm darf sich k√ºnftig ‚ÄûStadt Nieder-Olm‚Äú nennen\\" It is still the seat of the Verbandsgemeinde of Nieder-Olm, and functions as a middle centre in the region.  Geography   Location  Nieder-Olm lies some 10 km south of Mainz in the heart of Rhenish Hesse, on the east bank of the Selz in the northern part of the Rhenish-Hessian Hills (Rheinhessisches H√ºgelland), known as the Mainz Basin. The town's average elevation lies at some 150 m above sea level. The highest elevation within municipal limits is the M√ºhlberg at 243 m in the northeast between Nieder-Olm and Mainz-Ebersheim. The landscape is strongly characterized by winegrowing and fruit growing. A wood named Im Loh can be found in the northeast of the municipal area. It is only some 11 ha in area.  Geology  Predominant here are loess soils, which are of very high quality.  Climate  Owing to the location in the Mainz Basin, the climate in Nieder-Olm is very mild and dry. The mean temperature over the year is 8 ¬∞C, making the area one of the warmest in Central Europe. The yearly precipitation is, at 500 mm, rather slight.  Constituent communities  Nieder-Olm has one outlying Stadtteil called Goldberg.  Neighbouring municipalities  Clockwise from the north, these are: *Ober-Olm (Verbandsgemeinde of Nieder-Olm) *Klein-Winternheim (Verbandsgemeinde of Nieder-Olm) *Mainz (outlying centre of Ebersheim) *Zornheim (Verbandsgemeinde of Nieder-Olm) *S√∂rgenloch (Verbandsgemeinde of Nieder-Olm) *Saulheim (Verbandsgemeinde of W√∂rrstadt) *Stadecken-Elsheim (Verbandsgemeinde of Nieder-Olm) *Essenheim (Verbandsgemeinde of Nieder-Olm)  History   Early Middle Ages  Since so few written documents about Nieder-Olm from the Middle Ages are available, dating Nieder-Olm founding is difficult. Finds from grave digs from the late 6th century, however, point to an early settlement in this area. It is believed that this may have been brought about by the early Franks during the so-called Fr√§nkische Landnahme (‚ÄúFrankish Land-Taking‚Äù), when the Franks reconquered the lands formerly held by the Romans. The Frankish settlement called Reichelsheim lay roughly where the commercial development now lies in northwest Nieder-Olm and can still be made out in aerial photographs. The placename ending ‚Äîheim is typical of names that the Franks gave places, including many other nearby places. Reichelsheim, though, was later forsaken.  Middle Ages  Catholic Church in Nieder-Olm From the Middle Ages, Nieder-Olm was an Electoral Mainz holding. It is established by documents that in 899 Archbishop of Mainz Hatto I made over a landholding called Ulmena (Olm) to the wife of Emperor Arnulf of Carinthia with a lifetime term. This estate is believed to have lain in the area now occupied by Ober- Olm and is both municipalities‚Äô namesake. In 994, at Emperor Otto III's behest, the estate was put back under the Archbishopric's ownership. In the late 11th century, ownership was transferred to the Mainz Cathedral Foundation, in which time also arose Saint George's Catholic Church, expedited by strong ecclesiastical influence. The settlement's first fortifications are believed to date from the 12th century. These were made up of walls and ditches and had four main gates. Later, in the late 13th century, supposedly as a reaction to the building of Stadeck Castle, a castle with a moat was built within the municipal boundaries, to which noble Burgm√§nner were given priority. In the 15th century, Nieder-Olm found itself caught between the frontlines in an archiepiscopal feud being waged by Archbishops Diether von Isenburg and Adolf von Nassau. Its consequences entailed frequent changes in rulers. In 1503, Archbishop Berthold had the castle newly built to meet the requirements of what were then modern attack techniques. From this time, the castle was known as St. Laurenziburg. In the years that followed, both the castle and the fortifications were repeatedly destroyed. Today only a few remnants are left. In the early 19th century, the castle finally had to give way to a road. Quite well preserved is the defensive complex at the graveyard, which at the time surrounded the church.  Early modern times  During the Thirty Years' War, Nieder-Olm was repeatedly overrun by the enemy and in 1632 it was occupied by Swedish troops. Some 60 years later, in the Nine Years' War, Nieder-Olm was sacked by French troops. Once again in the late 18th century, Nieder-Olm was occupied. This time it was French Revolutionary troops. The French put a Liberty pole up in 1792 and made Nieder-Olm a part of the Republic of Mainz, which was the first democratic republic on German territory. Only a short time later ‚Äì the Republic of Mainz only lasted 100 days ‚Äì Nieder-Olm was reconquered by Imperial troops. As soon afterwards as 1797, though, French troops managed to take Nieder-Olm once again, and it thus became part of the Napoleonic Empire. After this fell, Nieder-Olm became in 1816 part of the newly founded province of Rhenish Hesse (Rheinhessen), which also made it part of the Grand Duchy of Hesse-Darmstadt. With the opening of the Hessian Ludwig Railway from Mainz to Alzey in 1871, Nieder-Olm was linked to the railway network.  First and Second World Wars  After the First World War, Nieder-Olm once again became French-occupied under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles. A border station of the occupied Rhineland was set up in an inn at that time, the Gasthaus zur sch√∂nen Aussicht. Having been returned to German sovereignty in 1929, Nieder-Olm was no more spared National Socialism than any other part of Germany. After Kristallnacht (9 November 1938), in which Jewish houses and shops were looted and destroyed, there were no more Jewish inhabitants in Nieder-Olm. Into the history of the Second World War went Nieder-Olm when during the Allied advance, scattered German troops in the Selz valley put up considerable resistance. Bearing witness to this time are American emplacements west of the Selz, which have, however, for safety's sake, been filled in.  Postwar to present  From 1946, Nieder-Olm belonged to the newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate. In the decades that followed, the infrastructure was under ongoing expansion: new schools arose (in 1957 the new primary school Burgschule Nieder-Olm, in 1974 the Hauptschule and special school and in 1981 the Gymnasium, as well as two schools for physically handicapped pupils and those with learning difficulties), a gymnasium and festival hall (1961) and the indoor and outdoor swimming pool (1968) were built. In 1980 the town acquired a connection to the A 63\\\\. Also in the last two decades, development was steadily furthered: new residential areas were laid out and older ones continually expanded. The commercial area was amply expanded and three new bypasses were built. In 1997 the old festival hall was torn down and replaced with the new Ludwig-Eckes- Halle. Likewise, the indoor and outdoor swimming pool was expanded into an adventure pool. Further upgrading is planned with a view to barring all through traffic and doing further building work, especially in the area around the primary school and Pariser Stra√üe. Today, Nieder-Olm has over 9,200 inhabitants and the number is growing. The Rhineland-Palatinate Cabinet decided on 24 October 2006 to grant Nieder-Olm the designation ‚Äútown‚Äù (Stadt in German). Nieder-Olm has been allowed since the delivery of the granting documents on 6 November 2006 by Rhineland-Palatinate Interior Minister Karl Peter Bruch to call itself the ‚ÄúTown of Nieder-Olm‚Äù (Stadt Nieder-Olm).  Politics   Town council  The council is made up of 24 council members, counting the mayor, with seats apportioned thus: { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" width=\\"60%\\" - bgcolor=\\"#eeeeee\\" align=\\"center\\"  CDU  SPD  FWG  The Greens  Total - align=\\"center\\"  2009  9  11  3  1  24 seats } (as at municipal election held on 7 June 2009)  Mayor  In 2019, Dirk Hasenfuss was elected as mayor of Nieder-Olm.  Town partnerships  * Recey-sur-Ource, C√¥te-d'Or, France since 1967 * Bussolengo, Province of Verona, Veneto, Italy since 1984 * L'Alc√∫dia, Valencia, Spain since 1989  Coat of arms  The town's arms might be described thus: Per fess argent a cross moline gules and gules a wheel spoked of six argent. The earliest seal, from 1519, shows the cross moline (that is, cross with pointed split ends turned out), whereas later ones show a cross patt√©e (that is, cross whose arms broaden at the ends, which are flat). The original form was chosen for inclusion in the modern arms. The reason for the cross's inclusion as a charge is unclear, although it has been suggested that it refers to Saint George, who is the patron saint. The wheel is the Wheel of Mainz, and refers to Nieder-Olm's allegiance to Electoral Mainz until 1803. The tinctures are also Mainz's.  Culture and sightseeing The Evangelical Parish Church in Nieder-Olm  Buildings  *The Evangelical Parish Church from the Late Classicist period was completed in 1865. It harbours a pulpit and altar table from 1808, both from the now demolished Welschnonnenkirche in Mainz. *Saint George's Catholic Parish Church comes from the year 1779. The quire tower on the east side is a remnant of the old mediaeval church from the 12th century; it was given a greater height and modified later in the 19th century.

Transport  = Roads = The Autobahn A 63 from Kaiserslautern to Mainz passes Nieder-Olm in the west and is linked to the town through two interchanges. On the one hand it is easy to reach the important north-south connection, the A 61 along this road, and on the other, it serves as a feeder to the urban agglomeration of the Frankfurt Rhine Main Region and the other Autobahnen that lead there. Over several Landesstra√üen (State Roads), Nieder-Olm is linked with neighbouring municipalities. = Local public transport =  Bus  Nieder-Olm is connected to local public transport by the ORN (Omnibusverkehr Rhein-Nahe GmbH), a bus company: *Route 66: Nieder-Olm - Zornheim - Mainz-Ebersheim - Mainz-Hechtsheim (ORN and Mainzer Verkehrsgesellschaft mbH) *Route 640: RegioLinie Ingelheim - Nieder-Olm Mitte - Nieder-Olm Bf. - Nieder-Olm Schulzentrum *Route 652: Mainz - Nieder-Olm Mitte - Nieder-Olm Bf. - S√∂rgenloch *Route 657: Sprendlingen / Budenheim / Mainz - Nieder-Olm Schulzentrum (school transport) *Route 667: Nieder-Olm Schulzentrum- Friesenheim (school transport)  Rail  In the east of downtown is found the Deutsche Bahn railway station. On weekdays, it is served strictly by half-hourly regional trains (RE/RB) in both directions on the Alzey‚ÄìMainz line. Even on Sundays and holidays, the service is only slightly less. In the morning rush hour there are two direct connections to Worms by way of Alzey. In the summer months, a few trains go through to Kirchheimbolanden. On weekends and holidays, journeys on the Elsass-Express (‚ÄúAlsace Express‚Äù) to Wissembourg are possible.  Public institutions  Nieder-Olm is the seat of the Verbandsgemeinde of Nieder-Olm.

Montford played with the Shreveport Pirates (4 games in his first year in the CFL), the Toronto Argonauts, the Edmonton Eskimos, the Charlotte Rage of the Arena Football League and, most famously, the Hamilton Tiger-Cats. He was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame in 2011. Career From 1989 to 1993, Montford attended South Carolina State University, leading the school in tackles in 1993. In 2007 South Carolina State celebrated there \\"100 years in football\\", and selected Montford as one of the top 100 players of all-time. Considered by many commentators as one of the greatest defensive players in the history of the Canadian Football League, Montford was a four-time CFL sack leader, three-time winner of the CFL's Most Outstanding Defensive Player Award, five-time East Division All-Star, and five-time CFL All-Star. In November, 2006, Montford was voted one of the CFL's Top 50 players (#40) of the league's modern era by Canadian sports network TSN. Montford enjoyed his best seasons as a Hamilton Tiger-Cats as the key player in the team's defensive front seven. Montford was the Tiger-Cats' all- time leader in tackles until former teammate and linebacker Rob Hitchcock broke the record while Montford was with the Eskimos. In 1999, Montford came within half a sack of Hall-of-Famer James Parker's single season record of 26.5, but missed out on defensive player of the year honours to teammate Calvin Tiggle as Hamilton, with Most Outstanding Player Danny McManus also on the team, took the 87th Grey Cup 32-21. Montford signed a high-priced deal with Toronto for the 2002 CFL season, but he failed to bring his old self to Toronto and struggled on a mediocre Argonauts team. This led to the team trading Montford back to Hamilton for speedy receiver Tony Miles and non- import fullback Randy Bowles on March 13, 2003. Montford played 2003 and 2004 back with Hamilton, as the team slid down the East Division standings. After the 2004 season, Montford was traded to Edmonton for offensive lineman Dan Comiskey (who the Eskimos later re-acquired in the Troy Davis trade). Montford played the 2005 season with Edmonton, and helped the team take the 93rd Grey Cup. In the championship game, it was Montford who chased Montr√©al Alouettes quarterback Anthony Calvillo out of the pocket on third-and-thirty-one and forced him to attempt a quick kick punt on the last play of overtime. On Wednesday, April 27, 2006, Montford was released from the Eskimos . On Monday, July 3, 2006, Montford was re-signed by the Eskimos . Aside from Joe Montford's public career as a professional football player he also spend months working with children in a group home in the suburbs of Atlanta, Georgia in 2000. He left this job after the parent company of the group home which owned similar facilities throughout the United States filed for bankruptcy and the decision was made to close the facility. Joe Montford was known there for teaching the kids many of whom had little or no parental involvement growing up how to play football and other sports. He served as one of the few positive male role models many of the teenage boys there he worked with ever had. To this day one of the boys he worked with who is now a college senior keeps the autographed card Joe Montford gave him in his wallet and carries it with him as a reminder of where he came from. Montford was inducted onto the Hamilton Tiger-Cats Wall Of Honour on August 23, 2018.

It is the seventh and final game developed for SNK's short-lived Hyper Neo Geo 64 hardware and like most games released for the platform, it has never been officially ported to home consoles. It was planned for release for the PS1 platform but was never officially released. Gameplay The control system uses two buttons for movement, keeping the player on a 2-D axis, despite the 3D arena. Pressing the left button moves the character in the left direction, pressing the right moves in that respective direction. Double tapping each button produces a dash in each corresponding direction for evasion and closing distance. Pressing both buttons makes the character block. By using the joystick, the player can execute attacks of varying damage levels. By pressing in the forward direction, the player executes a medium attack, up forward a stronger attack, and down, forward is the weakest, but fastest attack. By combining various combinations of the movement of the stick, a special attack is performed for increased damage. Unlike the 2-D iterations, however, no ranged attacks are present, keeping the preferred fighting distance between players at close quarters. A fighter can win by knocking out his opponent, forcing his opponent to surrender, or by winning a judgment by a panel of three judges if time runs out. The judges are allowed to cast ballots for either fighter or a tie ballot that does not contribute to the decision. A tie will force a player to either give up or buy a continue. Should a fighter fall outside of the ring, the fight is paused until both fighters are sent back into the ring to resume the fight. Plot Setting It's Spring 1999...

Geology The park is now dominated by Lake Bronson, and represents a transition between prairie and forest which supports a variety of wildlife. Thousands of years ago the area was covered by Glacial Lake Agassiz. Lake Agassiz retreated in stages leaving gravel ridges along a generally flat terrain. Streams quietly cut through these ridges and the dam that created Lake Bronson is blocking one of these ridges along the South Branch of the Two Rivers. History Kittson County has no natural lakes, which is unusual for Minnesota. In the early 1930s, during the Great Depression, Kittson County was going through a drought. Local officials decided to build a reservoir on the South Branch of Two Rivers near the city of Bronson. Supporters lobbied the state and federal government to fund the project, and in 1936, funding was finally made available. By this time, the plan had evolved into a recreation area in addition to the reservoir. Kittson County was lacking in recreation facilities, and officials realized that county residents and tourists would appreciate a park. Construction of the reservoir started in April 1936 with crews from the Works Progress Administration. It was difficult to find a stable bedrock foundation for the dam, so crews needed to squeeze water from the \\"quicksand\\" foundation. Pumps were used to pull water from the quicksand while the dam was built. Since the sand would get wet and soft again, the pumps were not a permanent solution. Rather, the dam was designed with ten seepage pipes that drain into a drainage tunnel passing through the dam's three spillways. The dam, completed in June 1937, created a reservoir and was well received by local residents. The land surrounding the new reservoir was designated a state park, and several fieldstone structures were built. The most prominent of these was a hexagonal stone water tower. Other structures, such as an office, a garage, a picnic shelter, and bathing facilities followed. In 1939, the city of Bronson renamed itself \\"Lake Bronson\\" to commemorate the new reservoir. The park is now a prime recreational destination in northwest Minnesota, visited by tourists from North Dakota and southern Canada as well as Minnesotans. Fishing, swimming, canoeing, and water skiing are popular on the lake, and snowmobiling and cross-country skiing are enjoyed during the winter. The park was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Media References The park is continually mentioned in David Robbins Endworld series of books, as it is the home of the Family (the main characters in the Series) known as The Home.

A Check- list and Atlas of the Seaweeds of Britain and Ireland. British Phycological Society, London. Porphyra is a chief source of plant-based vitamin B12. Life cycle Porphyra displays a heteromorphic alternation of generations.Porphyra life cycle The thallus we see is the haploid generation; it can reproduce asexually by forming spores which grow to replicate the original thallus. It can also reproduce sexually. Both male and female gametes are formed on the one thallus. The female gametes while still on the thallus are fertilized by the released male gametes, which are non-motile. The fertilized, now diploid, carposporangia after mitosis produce spores (carpospores) which settle, then bore into shells, germinate and form a filamentous stage. This stage was originally thought to be a different species of alga, and was referred to as Conchocelis rosea. That Conchocelis was the diploid stage of Porphyra was discovered by the British phycologist Kathleen Mary Drew-Baker in 1949 for the European species Porphyra umbilicalis. It was later shown for species from other regions as well.Thomas, D. 2002. Seaweeds. The Natural History Museum, London.

The marine red alga Porphyra has been cultivated extensively in many Asian countries as an edible seaweed used to wrap the rice and fish that compose the Japanese food sushi and the Korean food gimbap. In Japan, the annual production of Porphyra species is valued at 100 billion yen (US$1 billion).Aoki, Y. and Kamei, Y. 2006 Preparation of recombinant polysaccharide-degrading enzymes from the marine bacterium, Pseudomonas sp. ND137 for the production of protoplasts of Porphyra yezoensis Eur. J. Phycol. 41: 321-328. Source of Vitamin B12 One study in 2014 pointed to dried purple laver as a vegan source of biologically- active Vitamin B12. The study noted that B-12 was found in both raw and roasted seaweed, the latter containing about half as much‚Äîbut still a sufficient amount.

It is a Palaearctic species occurring from Ireland in the west, across Europe and Asia to Korea and Japan. It is also found in North Africa. The name Platanthera is derived from Greek, meaning \\"broad anthers\\", while the species name, bifolia, means \\"two leaves\\".  Identification  Platanthera bifolia, flower showing the parallel pollinia Lesser butterfly-orchids are not to be confused with the greater butterfly-orchid, which are about the same size. Lesser butterfly-orchids are distinguished by their two shining green basal leaves, especially of the hill form, which are shorter and broader and by the angle of the pollinia. The upper sepal and petals form a loose triangular hood above the pollinia, which lie parallel and close together, obscuring the opening into the spur, which is long and almost straight. There are usually around 25 white flowers tinged with yellow-green in a slim flower spike. The flowers are night-scented, but the chemical components of the scent are different from those of greater butterfly-orchid and attract different pollinators.  Hybrids  Hybrids of the two butterfly-orchids are rare, as are those between lesser butterfly-orchid and other species. However, hybrids have been recorded with frog orchid in South Uist (1949) and with the common spotted-orchid and the heath spotted-orchid.  Habitat  The lesser butterfly-orchid occupies a wide range of habitats, being far more tolerant of acid conditions than the greater butterfly-orchid. They are found in grasslands, woodlands (especially beech woods in southern England), in hill pastures up to 400m, on heaths and moorland, and in tussocky marshy ground.  Pollination  Sphingid moths are attracted by the scent of this orchid, and tend to hover in front of the flowers, resting their forelegs on the lip. As the proboscis enters the spur it pushes between the pollinia, dislodging the sticky discs which adhere to it. Pollinators include pine, small elephant and, to a lesser extent, elephant hawk-moths.  Conservation  This species has suffered a serious decline, especially in central and southern England, as a result of woodland clearance. Upland populations in the north and west have suffered from overgrazing.

Cegielski ‚Äì Pozna≈Ñ in the interwar Second Polish Republic In the summer of 1939, weeks ahead of the Nazi German and Soviet invasion of Poland the map of both Europe and Poland looked very different from today. The railway network of interwar Poland had little in common with the postwar reality of dramatically changing borders and political domination of the Soviet-style communism, as well as the pre- independence German, Austrian and Russian networks which the Second Polish Republic had partially inherited in 1918 after the end of World War I. The most important junctions in the Polish territory in summer of 1939 were: ‚Äì Lw√≥w (Lviv), Tarnopol (Ternopil), Stanis≈Çaw√≥w (Ivano-Frankivsk), Stryj (Stryy), Kowel (Kovel), Chodorow (Khodoriv), Ko≈Çomyja (Kolomyya) and Sarny (Sarny) ‚Äì all now in Ukraine, ‚Äì ≈Åuniniec (Luninyets), Baranowicze (Baranavichy), Brze≈õƒá nad Bugiem (Brest), Lida (Lida), Wo≈Çkowysk (Vawkavysk) and Mo≈Çodeczno (Maladzyechna) ‚Äì all now in Belarus, ‚Äì Wilno (Vilnius), Landwarow (Lentvaris) ‚Äì now in Lithuania, ‚Äì Cieszyn Zachodni (ƒåesk√Ω Tƒõ≈°√≠n), Bogumin (Bohum√≠n) ‚Äì now in the Czech Republic. Main Railway Terminal in today's Lviv, Ukraine, an Art Nouveau style construction designed in 1903 by W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sad≈Çowski for Austria's Lemberg, a city in 1939 placed in Poland as Lw√≥w Several junctions of today's Poland belonged in 1939 to Germany or the Free City of Danzig. Among them were such hubs as: Breslau (Wroc≈Çaw), Stettin (Szczecin), Oppeln (Opole), Allenstein (Olsztyn), Liegnitz (Legnica), K√∂slin (Koszalin), Schneidem√ºhl (Pi≈Ça), Neustettin (Szczecinek), Lyck (E≈Çk). Second Polish Republic 1922-1939 Polish railway network in 1939 The 1939 rail map of Poland was set by the nation's pre-1914 borders that were determined by the three empires that partitioned the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth late in the 18th century. In the western part of Poland, in Pozna≈Ñ Voivodeship, Pomorze Voivodeship, and the Autonomous Silesian Voivodeship (former territories of the German Empire), the rail network was very dense. There were stations in all the towns and almost every city served as a junction. Southern Poland (the former Austrian province of Galicia with Krak√≥w Voivodeship, Lw√≥w Voivodeship, Stanis≈Çaw√≥w Voivodeship, and Tarnopol Voivodeship) was less developed. The areas with a fairly dense rail network were only around Krak√≥w and Lw√≥w. In the very south, along the border with Slovakia, Romania, and Hungary, rail lines were virtually non-existent, although it is fair to say that lines would have been difficult to build in that mostly mountainous region anyway. The worst situation was in Central and Eastern Poland ‚Äì the territory of the former Russian Empire. These were the Voivodeships of ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Kielce, Warszawa, Lublin, Bia≈Çystok, Volhynian, Polesie, Nowogr√≥dek and Wilno. The rail network in some parts, especially in easternmost provinces (close to the Soviet border), was nonexistent. A better situation was around Warsaw and ≈Å√≥d≈∫. Even though the Polish railway network in 1939 had deficiencies, the majority of important cities had convenient rail connections with each other. The major exception was the connection of Wilno to the seaport of Gdynia, some 500 km away. Trains running on this route had to cover a distance of about 900 km, because they had to go via Warsaw. Construction of a line that would shorten this distance was planned, but the start of World War II prevented any work. This line would have taken the route: Lapy (on the Warsaw-Bia≈Çystok line) ‚Äì Ostro≈Çƒôka ‚Äì Przasnysz ‚Äì M≈Çawa (located on the Warsaw ‚Äì Gda≈Ñsk/Gdynia line). Another rail connection whose construction was stopped by the war was the line Dƒôbica ‚Äì Pilzno ‚Äì Jas≈Ço. Works on it had already started in early 1939, but were never finished. Electrification of long-distance lines was planned, but by 1939 only some of the suburban stretches around Warsaw were upgraded with the electric infrastructure. Polish national railway's structure in 1939 In the summer of 1939, the PKP was divided into eight regions ‚Äì Warsaw, Toru≈Ñ, Pozna≈Ñ, Katowice, Cracow, Radom, Lw√≥w and Wilno, with PKP's headquarters located in Warsaw. Also, for practical purposes, PKP was divided into five communications districts and every train in the timetable was numbered according to the district within which it operated. The districts were as follows: ‚Äì First ‚Äì North-West, starting with the 278 km route Warsaw ‚Äì M≈Çawa ‚Äì GrudziƒÖdz ‚Äì Laskowice Pomorskie (timetable route number 101), ‚Äì Second ‚Äì West, starting with the 379 km route Warsaw ‚Äì Kutno ‚Äì Pozna≈Ñ ‚Äì ZbƒÖszy≈Ñ (timetable route number 201), ‚Äì Third ‚Äì South-West, starting with the 318 km route Warsaw ‚Äì Koluszki ‚Äì ZƒÖbkowice ‚Äì Katowice (timetable route number 301), ‚Äì Fourth ‚Äì South-East, starting with the 491 km route Warsaw ‚Äì Radom ‚Äì Skar≈ºysko ‚Äì Rozwad√≥w ‚Äì Przemy≈õl ‚Äì Lw√≥w (timetable route number 401), ‚Äì Fifth ‚Äì North-East, starting with the 571 km route Warsaw ‚Äì Bia≈Çystok ‚Äì Wilno ‚Äì Turmont (timetable route number 501). Polish station on postcard, 1930s The summer 1939 timetable \\"Urzƒôdowy Rozk≈Çad Jazdy i Lot√≥w Lato 1939\\" (\\"Official Train and Flight Timetable Summer 1939\\") was published in May 1939 and was valid from May 15, 1939 to October 7, 1939. What adds to this document's importance is the time it was published: just a few months before the Polish Second Republic (Druga Rzeczpospolita) ceased to exist. In the document we can find the following: :The following timetable is valid until October 7. On midnight of October 8, a new Winter timetable will be introduced, valid until May 18, 1940. All suggestions for necessary changes in the Winter timetable should be presented to the Polish National Railways Regional Directions not later than August 1. Apart from the train timetable, the document also included the flight timetable of LOT Polish Airlines. Types of trains in 1939 The following types of trains were run in Poland at that time: express, fast, and ordinary. The most interesting and impressive were the diesel express trains, or \\"Pociagi Motorowe-Ekspresowe ‚Äì MtE\\" (some of them operated with the famous Luxtorpeda). The MtE units achieved speeds up to 110 km/h and connected Warsaw with the most important cities, as well as major tourist areas. The 179 km journey from Warszawa Wschodnia (Warsaw East) to Bia≈Çystok Centralny was covered in 1 hour 56 minutes. MtE trains ran from Warsaw to ≈Å√≥d≈∫ (a distance of 133 km in 1 hour 28 minutes), Krak√≥w, Katowice (through either Czƒôstochowa or Kielce), and Suwa≈Çki. They also operated on lines from Krak√≥w to Katowice and the mountain resorts of Zakopane and Krynica. In southeastern Poland, MtE trains ran from Lw√≥w to Zaleszczyki, Boryslaw, Tarnopol, and Kolomyja. In August 1939 a new MtE connected Warsaw with Pozna≈Ñ (due to the war the service lasted only few days). Warsaw lacked an MtE connection with Lw√≥w (the third largest city in 1939 Poland). This problem was solved by taking the morning express to Krak√≥w where it split at Skarzysko, with one part becoming an express to Przeworsk. There passengers could also change to an international fast train travelling between Berlin and Bucharest. Fast trains served long- distance lines, but they were not quite as fast as the MtE trains. The most interesting fast trains in the summer 1939 were: * Wilno ‚Äì Lw√≥w (a journey of 720 km.) It crossed practically the whole Polish Eastern Borderlands, stopping at Lida, Baranowicze, Luniniec, Rowne, and Zdolbunow. * Lw√≥w ‚Äì Krak√≥w ‚Äì Katowice ‚Äì Pozna≈Ñ ‚Äì Bydgoszcz ‚Äì Gdynia ‚Äì Hel (a journey of almost 1000 km). It traveled non-stop through the territory of the Free City of Danzig. The last train category in Poland were ordinary trains. They usually served short- distance lines, but in some cases covered impressive distances, especially in the Polish Eastern Borderlands. International trains In 1939, trains tended to run over longer distances than today. The Nord Express Warsaw ‚Äì Berlin ‚Äì Paris ‚Äì Calais ran daily and it was the only train in Poland of the L (Luxurious) standard. This train consisted only of coaches owned by the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits. There also was another train to the English Channel coast: from Warsaw, Lw√≥w, Krak√≥w and Katowice to Ostend. Warsaw was also connected with the capital of France by a Warsaw ‚Äì ≈Å√≥d≈∫ ‚Äì Paris train. Another train to France ran from Warsaw to Strasbourg, with cars to Geneva and Ventimiglia. As for the south of Europe, trains ran from Warsaw to Rome, and in the summer also to three cities in Yugoslavia: Split, Su≈°ak and Belgrade. A train from Berlin to Istanbul crossed the Polish territory. Warsaw, Cracow and Lw√≥w had trains to Vienna. Warsaw was connected with Prague, Bratislava and ≈Ωilina. Lw√≥w and Gdynia were also connected with Prague. Budapest had train connections with Warsaw, Cracow and Lw√≥w (the train from Cracow to Budapest had a coach from Krynica to Budapest attached). Romania was served twice daily by Warsaw-Lw√≥w-Bucharest trains (in the summer an additional train reached the Romanian seaport of Constan≈£a). Poland was also crossed by an international train Berlin ‚Äì Breslau ‚Äì Katowice ‚Äì Krak√≥w ‚Äì Lw√≥w ‚Äì Sniatyn ‚Äì Bucharest (with a direct car Katowice ‚Äì Constan≈£a). Other transit trains ran between Berlin and East Prussia, Danzig, Riga and Daugavpils. Twice a day a train from Wilno reached Kaunas. One of them had a direct Warsaw-Kaunas coach. Passenger rail connections between the Soviet Union and Western Europe required a change of trains due to the difference in gauge. If one traveled towards Moscow, it was necessary to change at the Soviet border station Niegoreloje. Travelling from Moscow, the change took place at the Polish station Stolpce. Altogether there were 48 rail border crossings in operation in the summer of 1939. Curiosities * Rail lines of Wolne Miasto Gda≈Ñsk (Free City of Danzig) were controlled by the Toru≈Ñ region of the Polish State Railways, therefore were included in the Polish timetable. * In the summer of 1939, three pairs of German transit trains crossed the Polish Corridor daily en route to East Prussia: two between Berlin and Eydtkau (now Chernyshevskoye) and one between Berlin and Tilsit (now Sovetsk). They travelled through the Polish territory between Chojnice and Tczew-Liessau (Lisewo), the distance of 97 km. * Apart from long-distance fast trains, there were also ordinary and accelerated trains, that ran on very long routes in interwar Poland. The best example is the train Wejherowo ‚Äì Toru≈Ñ ‚Äì Kutno ‚Äì ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Kaliska ‚Äì Rozwad√≥w ‚Äì Lw√≥w, which crossed virtually the whole Poland, from southeast to the coast (930 km). Other interesting examples are: Warszawa Wilenska ‚Äì Brzesc n/B Centralny ‚Äì Pinsk ‚Äì Mikaszewicze (490 km), Warszawa Wilenska ‚Äì Siedlce ‚Äì Wolkowysk ‚Äì Lida ‚Äì Molodeczno (530 km), Warszawa Glowna ‚Äì Lublin ‚Äì Kowel ‚Äì Zdolbunow (480 km), Warsaw Gdanska ‚Äì Lublin ‚Äì Rejowiec ‚Äì Zawada ‚Äì Rawa Ruska ‚Äì Lw√≥w (438 km).

It compares a firm's current assets to its current liabilities, and is expressed as follows: \\\\mbox{Current ratio} = \\\\frac {\\\\mbox{Current Assets}} {\\\\mbox{Current Liabilities}} The current ratio is an indication of a firm's liquidity. Acceptable current ratios vary from industry to industry. In many cases, a creditor would consider a high current ratio to be better than a low current ratio, because a high current ratio indicates that the company is more likely to pay the creditor back. Large current ratios are not always a good sign for investors. If the company's current ratio is too high it may indicate that the company is not efficiently using its current assets or its short-term financing facilities. If current liabilities exceed current assets the current ratio will be less than 1. A current ratio of less than 1 indicates that the company may have problems meeting its short-term obligations. Some types of businesses can operate with a current ratio of less than one, however. If inventory turns into cash much more rapidly than the accounts payable become due, then the firm's current ratio can comfortably remain less than one. Inventory is valued at the cost of acquiring it and the firm intends to sell the inventory for more than this cost. The sale will therefore generate substantially more cash than the value of inventory on the balance sheet. Low current ratios can also be justified for businesses that can collect cash from customers long before they need to pay their suppliers.  Limitations  # The ratio is only useful when two companies are compared within industry because inter industry business operations differ substantially. # To determine liquidity, the current ratio is not as helpful as the quick ratio, because it includes all those assets that may not be easily liquidated, like prepaid expenses and inventory.

Wagner hoped to establish a museum in which to display the treasures of the College of Arms itself. A plan for a building adjacent to the college was commissioned from Raymond Erith, but not taken forward due to the increasing financial demands of repairs to the college building. In 1980 the Heralds' Museum was opened by the Duke of Kent as part of the Tower of London. The museum was open during the summer season and admission was included in admission to the Tower. Exhibits included items from the collection of College of Arms and artifacts borrowed from other sources. Peter Spurrier served as its curator, and John Brooke-Little as its director.

He was credited with 54 victories and, after the war, helped found the Royal Canadian Air Force. Donald MacLaren was born in Ottawa but his family moved first to Calgary in 1899, then to Vancouver in 1911. In 1912 MacLaren went to Montreal to study at McGill University. In 1914 an illness forced him to abandon his studies and he returned to Vancouver. After recovering MacLaren, his father and his brother opened a fur trading post at a remote point on the Peace River. While there MacLaren learned to speak Cree. In 1916 the family gave up the trading post to help in the war effort. MacLaren's father was not allowed to join the army so he got a job with the Imperial Munitions Board. His sons did enlist - Donald joining the Royal Flying Corps. He did his initial training at 90 Central Training School at Armour Heights and then at Camp Borden in Ontario, then finally received further training in England at No. 43 Training School, Ternhill. He was then transferred into No. 34 Training School for final fighter orientation on the Bristol Scout and Sopwith Camel, completing 9 hours solo on the Camel. On 23 November 1917 he was sent to France where he joined No. 46 Squadron. His first air combat was in February 1918, where MacLaren successfully shot down a German fighter 'out of control'. He was awarded the Military Cross for a sortie on 21 March 1918 in which he helped destroy a railway gun with his bombs, then shot down a balloon and two German LVG two-seaters. In September he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. When the squadron commander was killed in a crash later in the year MacLaren was given command. In late October MacLaren, who had escaped injury in combat, broke his leg during a friendly wrestling match with another member of his squadron. He was sent back to England on 6 November and was in the hospital when the Armistice was announced. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his leadership of the squadron in the last months of the war. MacLaren finished the war with a Military Cross and bar, a Distinguished Flying Cross and the DSO. He was also awarded the French Legion of Honour and Croix de guerre. MacLaren claimed 1 aircraft shared captured, 5 (and 1 shared) balloons destroyed, 15 (and 6 shared) aircraft destroyed, and 18 (and 8 shared) aircraft 'down out of control'. This was despite the fact that his first dogfight wasn't until February 1918 and that he scored all his victories in only nine months. Among others, he probably shot down ace Mieczys≈Çaw Garsztka on 2 October 1918 (shared with James Leith and Cyril Sawyer) Kopa≈Ñski, Tomasz J.: Mieczys≈Çaw Garsztka - polski as Kajzera, in: Militaria vol.4 No.1/1999, ISSN 1231-692X, p. 48. When he left hospital he was attached to the newly formed Royal Canadian Air Force and was in command of the Canadian pilots in England as they were transferred to the new air force. Under Maclaren's watch, 112 aircraft were granted by the British Air Ministry to form the nucleus of the RCAF. He returned to Canada on leave in late 1919 when he married Verna Harrison of Calgary. He returned to England in February 1920 but resigned from the RCAF later that year. By 1922 MacLaren returned to Canada and in 1924 established the first flying service on the west coast, and by 1926 formed Pacific Airways which was eventually acquired by Western Canada Airways. In the early 1920s he had begun planning for a seaplane base, an RCAF station at Jericho Beach, Vancouver, used for seaplane and flying boat training. He later recommended an airport at Sea Island, opening as Sea Island Airport in 1931 and which by 1940 was used by the RCAF as a seaplane base station, which had relocated from Jericho, and evolved into what is now Vancouver International Airport. Donald MacLaren died on 4 July 1988, aged 95. Having downed all of his 54 victories in the Sopwith Camel, he's the most successful pilot in the type. He served in 46 Squadron RFC/RAF alongside VM Yeates, the author of the seminal World War I novel \\"Winged Victory\\" in which Tom Cundall, the main protagonist's flight commander is a Canadian called \\"Mac\\". It is widely believed that this character was based on MacLaren.

The work is structured like the Qur ºan itself and divided into 111 chapters each with 42 verses. In addition, each chapter is headed by some combination of mysterious disconnected letters.

The Hayasa-Azzi confederation was in conflict with the Hittite Empire in the 14th century BC, leading up to the collapse of Hatti around 1190 BC. Before Tudhaliya III (1500-1340s BC) Location of Hayasa-Azzi Hittite inscriptions deciphered in the 1920s by the Swiss scholar Emil Forrer testify to the existence of a mountain country, the Hayasa and/or the Azzi, lying around Lake Van. Several prominent authorities agree in placing Azzi to the north of Ishuwa. Others see Hayasa and Azzi as identical. Records of the time between Telipinu and Tudhaliya III are sketchy. The Hittites seem to have abandoned their capital at Hattusa and moved to Sapinuwa under one of the earlier Tudhaliya kings. In the early 14th century BC, Sapinuwa was burned as well. Hattusili III records at this time that the Azzi had \\"made Samuha its frontier.\\" It should be borne in mind that people who view themselves as great civilizations are not always too particular about which group of so-called \\"Barbarians\\" they are fighting. Also at times multiple atrocities are blamed on one group as a rallying cry for a current war. Tudhaliya III and Suppiluliuma I (1360s-1320s BC) Tudhaliya III chose to make the city of Samuha, \\"an important cult centre located on the upper course of the Marassantiya river\\"Trevor R. Bryce, The Kingdom of the Hittites, Oxford University Press. 1998, p. 160. It should be stressed that Bryce's Tudhaliya III is equivalent to wikipedia's Tudhaliya II. There is some disagreement among Hittitologists over the precise number of kings named Tudhaliya. as a temporary home for the Hittite royal court sometime after his abandonment of Hattusa in the face of attacks against his kingdom by the Kaska, Hayasa-Azzi and other enemies of his state. Samuha was, however, temporarily seized by forces from the country of Azzi.Bryce, p. 160 At this time, the kingdom of Hatti was so besieged by fierce attacks from its enemies that many neighbouring powers expected it to soon collapse. The Egyptian pharaoh, Amenhotep III, even wrote to Tarhundaradu, king of Arzawa: \\"I have heard that everything is finished and that the country of Hattusa is paralysed.\\"(EA 31, 26-27)William L. Moran, The Amarna Letters, Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992, p. 101 However, Tudhaliya managed to rally his forces; indeed, the speed and determination of the Hittite king may have surprised Hatti's enemies including the Kaska and Hayasa-Azzi.Bryce, pp. 160-162 Tudhaliya sent his general Suppiluliuma, who would later serve as king himself under the title Suppiluliuma I, to Hatti's northeastern frontiers, to defeat Hayasa-Azzi. The Hayasans initially retreated from a direct battle with the Hittite commander. The Hittitologist Trevor R. Bryce notes, however, that Tudhaliya and Suppiluliuma eventually: : invaded Hayasa-Azzi and forced a showdown with its king Karanni (or Lanni) near the city of Kumaha. The passage (in the 'Deeds of Suppiluliuma') recording the outcome of this battle is missing. But almost certainly, the Hittite campaign resulted in the conquest of Hayasa-Azzi, for subsequently Suppiluliuma established it as a Hittite vassal state, drawing up a treaty with Hakkana, its current ruler.(CTH 42); see also Bryce, pp. 162-63 The Hayasans were now obliged to repatriate all captured Hittite subjects and cede \\"the border [territory] which Suppiluliuma claimed belonged to the Land of Hatti.\\"Bryce, p. 163 Despite the restrictions imposed upon Hakkani, he was not a completely meek and submissive brother-in law of the Hittites in political and military affairs. As a condition for the release of the thousands of Hittite prisoners held in his domain, he demanded first the return of the Hayasan prisoners confined in Hatti. During their reigns, the cuneiform tablets of Boƒüazk√∂y begin to mention the names of three successive kings who ruled over a state of Hayasa and/or Azzi. They were Karanni, Mariya, and Hakkani (or Hukkana). Hakkani, married a Hittite princess. When Suppiluliuma had become king himself, Hakkani proceeded to marry Suppiluliuma's sister. In a treaty signed with Hakkani, Suppiluliuma I mentions a series of obligations of civil right: : My sister, whom I gave you in marriage has sisters; through your marriage, they now become your relatives. Well, there is a law in the land of the Hatti. Do not approach sisters, your sisters-in law or your cousins; that is not permitted. In Hatti Land, whosoever commits such an act does not live; he dies. In your country, you do not hesitate to marry your own sister, sister-in law or cousin, because you are not civilized. Such an act cannot be permitted in Hatti. Mursili II (1320s-1290s BC) The kingdom of Hayasa-Azzi remained a loyal Hittite vassal state for a time, perhaps hit by the same plague which claimed Suppiluliuma and his son Arnuwanda II. But, in Mursili's seventh year (three years before Mursili's eclipse - so, 1315 BC), the \\"lord of Azzi\\" Anniya took advantage of Pihhuniya's unification of the Kaskas and raided the Land of Dankuwa, a Hittite border region, where he transported its population back to his kingdom. Cavaignac wrote of that period that Anniya \\"had sacked several districts and refused to release the prisoners taken.\\" Anniya's rebellion soon prompted a Hittite response. The Hittite King Mursili II, having defeated Pihhuniya, marched to the borders of Hayasa-Azzi where he demanded Anniya return his captured subjects.Bryce, p. 219 When Anniya refused, Mursili immediately attacked the Hayasa's border fortress of Ura.AM 86-7 In the following spring, he crossed the Euphrates and re-organized his army at Ingalova which, about ten centuries later, was to become the treasure-house and burial-place of the Armenian kings of the Arshakuni Dynasty. One of the captured fortresses lay on the west side of Lake Van. Despite Mursili's Year 7 and probable Year 8 campaigns against Hayasa-Azzi, Anniya was still unsubdued and continued to defy the Hittite king's demands to return his people at the beginning of Mursili's Ninth year. Then, in the latter's Year 9, Anniya launched a major counter-offensive by once again invading the Upper Land region on the Northeast frontier of Hatti, destroying the Land of Istitina and placing the city of Kannuwara under siege.AM 110-11 Worse still, Mursili II was forced to face another crisis in the same year with the death of his brother Sarri-Kusuh, the Hittite viceroy of Syria. This prompted a revolt by the Nuha≈°≈°e lands against Hittite control.Bryce, p. 220 Mursili II took decisive action by dispatching his general Kurunta to quell the Syrian rebellion while he sent another general, the able Nuwanza (or Nuvanza) to expel the Hayasa-Azzi enemy from the Upper Land. After consulting some oracles, the king ordered Nuwanza to seize the Upper Land territory from the Hayasan forces. This Nuwanza did by inflicting a resounding defeat against the Hayasa-Azzi invaders; henceforth, Upper Land would remain \\"firmly in Hittite hands for the rest of Mursili's reign under the immediate authority of a local governor appointed by the king.\\"Bryce, p. 221 While Mursili II would invade and reconquer Hayasa-Azzi in his tenth year,AM 130-3 its formal submission did not occur until the following year of the Hittite king's reign. The Annals of Mursili describe the campaigns of Mursili against Hayasa-Azzi below:CTH 61, 43, 78 :The people of Nahasse arose and besieged\\" (name indecipherable). \\"Other enemies and the people of Hayasa likewise. They plundered Institina, blockaded Ganuvara with troops and chariots. And because I had left Nuvanzas, the chief cup-bearer, and all the heads of the camp and troops and chariots in the High Country, I wrote to Nuvanzas as follows; 'See the people of Hayasa have devastated Institina, and blockaded the city of Ganuvara.' And Nuvanza led troops and chariots for aid and marched to Ganuvara And then he sent to me a messenger and wrote to me; 'Will you not go to consult for me the augur and the foreteller? Could not a decision be made for me by the birds and the flesh of the expiatory victims? :And I sent to Nuvanza this letter: 'See, I consulted for you birds and flesh, and they commanded, Go! because these people of Hayasa, the God U, has already delivered to you; strike them! :And as I was returning from Astatan to Carchemish, the royal prince Nana-Lu came to meet me on the road and said, 'The Hayasan enemy having besieged Ganuvara, Nuvanza marched against him and met him under the walls of Ganuvara. Ten thousand men and seven hundred chariots were drawn up in battle against him, and Nuvanza defeated them. There are many dead and many prisoners. (Here the tablets are defaced, and 15 lines lost.) :And when I arrived in Tiggaramma, the chief cup-bearer Nuvanza and all the noblemen came to meet me at Tiggaramma. I should have marched to Hayasa still, but the chiefs said to me, 'The season is now far advanced, Sire, Lord! Do not go to Hayasa.' And I did not go to Hayasa. Decline of Hayasa Mursili, himself, could now take satisfaction in the reduction of the hostile and aggressive kingdom of Hayasa- Azzi once more to a Hittite vassal state.Bryce, p.223 After Anniya's defeat, Hayasa-Azzi never appears again in the Hittite (or Assyrian) records as a unified nation. Hayasa as a fighting power was practically eliminated by the expedition of Mursili II. Hayasa and Armenians The similarity of the name Hayasa to the endonym of the Armenians, Hayk or Hay and the Armenian name for Armenia, Hayastan has prompted the suggestion that the Hayasa-Azzi confederation was involved in the Armenian ethnogenesis, or perhaps had been an Armenian-speaking state. One theory suggests that Hay derives from the Proto Indo-European word *h‚ÇÇ√©yos (or possibly *√°yos), meaning \\"metal.\\" According to this theory, Hayasa meant \\"land of metal,\\" referring to the early metallurgy techniques developed in the region. The term Hayastan bears resemblance to the ancient Mesopotamian god Haya (ha-i√†) and another western deity called Ebla Hayya, related to the god Ea (Enki or Enkil in Sumerian, Ea in Akkadian and Babylonian). Thus, the Great Soviet Encyclopedia of 1962 posited that the Armenians derive from a migration of Hayasa into Shupria in the 12th century BC.\\"Armenians\\" article, Great Soviet Encyclopedia This is open to objection due to the possibility of a mere coincidental similarity between the two names.Anne Elizabeth Redgate, The Armenians, Wiley-Blackwell, 2000 , p. 24. The region covered by Hayasa-Azzi would later constitute Lesser Armenia, as well as the western and south-western regions of Ancient Armenia. The main temples of many pre-Christian Armenian gods such as Aramadz, Anahit, Mher, Nane, and Barsamin were located in Hayasa. The treasury and royal burials of the Arsacid (Arshakuni) dynasty would be located in this region as well during the 1st millennium BCE.Vahan Kurkjian A History of Armenia AGBU. (1958) pp. 35 The mentioning of the name Armenia can only be securely dated to the 6th century BC with the Orontid kings and very little is known specifically about the people of Hayasa-Azzi per se.Bryce, pp. 158-63; Trevor Bryce records Hayasa-Azzis's known activities against Hatti but never once mentions its cultural background. Nevertheless, some scholars believe that Armenians were native to the Hayasa region, or perhaps moved into the Hayasa region from nearby northern or eastern regions (such as modern southern Georgia or northern Armenia). A minority of historians theorize that after the Phrygian invasion of Hittites, the hypothetically named Armeno-Phrygians would have settled in Hayasa-Azzi, and merged with the local people, who were possibly already spread within the western regions of Urartu,The Kingdom of Armenia, A History by Mack Chahin, 1987 (revised 2001), p.180-182. however, there is almost no evidence of an Armenian-Phrygian connection.

In his 2003 book Race Against Evil: The Secret Missions of the Interpol Agent Who Tracked the World's Most Sinister Criminals, he claimed to have worked in Asia as a Mormon missionary who transitioned into a career as a killer and secret agent: \\"a 'cleaner,'\\" said Publishers Weekly in a review of the book, \\"interrogating and 'eliminating' child pornographers who his boss at Interpol had determined were beyond the reach of other law enforcement agencies.\\" Bannon's claims were debunked after his arrest in Boulder, Colorado on January 27, 2006 on the charges of criminal impersonation, computer crime, and attempted theft. The charges leveled against him asserted that he created a fraudulent history of involvement with Interpol and expertise in human trafficking in order to earn fees for consulting and presenting on these topics. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Bannon was paid speaking fees based on his \\"bogus\\" credentials; state authorities had confirmed, for instance, that Bannon \\"had solicited fees in excess of $3,000 for a two-day training course on human trafficking.\\" The Justice Department also quoted a statement from the Interpol General Secretariat rejecting Bannon's claims: : Interpol's General Secretariat in Lyon has no record of David Race Bannon having been employed and no knowledge of individuals mentioned in Mr. Bannon's book. Interpol exists to facilitate the exchange of information between the world's law enforcement agencies and to provide analysis of criminal data and other services. Accordingly, the claims in Mr. Bannon's book can only be seen as deceptive and irresponsible fantasy. In February 2006, the martial-arts-related website Bullshido.net published the results of what the Rocky Mountain News called an \\"exhaustive dissection of Bannon's published claims\\", conducted by an attorney in Connecticut. That investigation found no basis for Bannon's own claims and also found strong indications that Bannon had used a sockpuppet identity, a supposed journalist named \\"Jason Putman,\\" to support his claims. On April 24, 2006, Bannon pleaded guilty to the charge of criminal impersonation before a Colorado judge. His guilty plea was made in exchange for prosecutors dropping the additional charges of computer crime and attempted theft. According to the district attorney prosecuting the case, Bannon was likely facing fines rather than incarceration. Personal life Jessica Autumn Bannon Memorial Film Collection in Chester, South Carolina (2017). Bannon was born in Tacoma, Washington and grew up in Spokane Valley, Washington.

It is the first stop after leaving Inverness station, heading north on the Kyle of Lochalsh Line and the Far North Line.  History  Beauly station in 1961 The Inverness and Ross-shire Railway, which was to be a line between and , was authorised in 1860, and opened in stages. The first section, that between Inverness and , opened on 11 June 1862, and one of the original stations was that at Beauly. It had two platforms, a passing loop and a goods shed with sidings that was equipped with a 1¬Ω ton crane. The station was host to a LMS caravan from 1936 to 1939. The station closed a nearly a century later, on 13 June 1960, along with most of the others between Inverness and . This was due to increasing competition from motorbuses, particularly those of Highland Omnibuses Ltd. Following a local campaign, the station was reopened in 2002. A new platform, shelter and car park were built in a ¬£250,000 project. The platform is the shortest in Great Britain, only long enough for a single carriage and measuring in 2013 compared with 's . Normally operated by trains, there is only one door in operation. Announcements are made on the train as to which door this will be. The original station building is now used for offices and housing. The reopening of the station led to 75% of local commuters switching from road to rail. Beauly has therefore provided a boost to campaigns to open small basic local stations. In 2007/8 with its population of just 1,164 Beauly's usage to population ratio (36 annual journeys per head) ranked as one of the highest in Britain. Plans to reopen nearby Conon Bridge railway station in a similar style were fulfilled on 8 February 2013. The station is from , and has a single platform which is long enough for a one-coach train.

light beam. Three types are available: variable frequency rotating disc choppers, fixed frequency tuning fork choppers, and optical shutters. A rotating disc chopper was famously used in 1849 by Hippolyte Fizeau in the first non-astronomical measurement of the speed of light. Use in science laboratories Typical experimental setup Optical choppers, usually rotating disc mechanical shutters, are widely used in science labs in combination with lock-in amplifiers. The chopper is used to modulate the intensity of a light beam, and a lock-in amplifier is used to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. To be effective, an optical chopper should have a stable rotating speed. In cases where the 1/f noise is the main problem, one would like to select the maximum chopping frequency possible. This is limited by the motor speed and the number of slots in the rotating disc, which is in turn limited by the disc radius and the beam diameter. Examples Optical incremental rotary encoders are a form of choppers. These are used in many industrial machines. Some early anti-lock braking systems used rotary encoders for wheel speed sensors. Late 20th century opto- mechanical computer mice used two encoders for X-Y position measurement. Optical linear encoders also exist. LCD televisions use millions of LCD shutters paired with red, green or blue filters to control the color of the pixels on the screen. Movie cameras use an optical shutter to record individual frames of the movie. Movie projectors use an optical shutter synchronized with the movie frames to produce the effect of apparent motion on the movie screen. Liquid crystal shutter glasses are used in conjunction with a synchronized display screen to create the illusion of a three-dimensional image. Light signals are sent at sea and at airports using a signal lamp with a hand-operated shutter.  See also  * Stroboscope  References   External links  Frequently asked questions on optical choppers.

M. Viquesney, designed to honor the veterans and casualties of World War I. Mass-produced during the 1920s and 1930s for communities throughout the United States, the statue's design was the most popular of its kind, spawning a wave of collectible miniatures and related memorabilia as well as numerous copies by other artists. Its title is often shortened to The Doughboy. Memorials The statue depicts a doughboy walking through shattered tree stumps strung with barbed wire, his rifle in his left hand and his right hand held high above his head, clutching a hand grenade. The aggressive design and affordability of the statue made it extremely popular, and more than 150 copies of it were created for municipal memorials across the nation. The Smithsonian American Art Museum currently lists 159 locations. Of that number, 134 currently existing originals have been independently authenticated, and several have been identified as copies by other artists (notably Over the Top by John Paulding). Viquesney's actual brochures quoted a figure of over 300 by the late 1930s, claiming at least one in every state of the Union, but this is believed to be an inflated figure. Two of the statues, both in Arkansas, are individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places; one in Helena and one in Fort Smith. Installed in cemeteries, town squares, and parks, outside museums, on courthouse lawns, and countless other places, the design is said to be the most-viewed example of outdoor statuary in the U.S. (after the Statue of Liberty) although many people do not even realize they have seen it. In 1998, longtime Sarasota- resident sculptor Frank Colson was commissioned to create a copy for the city of Sarasota, Florida, and again in 2002, for the city of Columbia, South Carolina. These were new copies in their own right, not meant to replace any existing Doughboys as Sarasota never had an original Viquesney Doughboy. An original does exist in another part of Columbia, SC, giving that city two; an original and a copy. Colson and his son also worked on the restoration of the Doughboy in Clearwater, Florida, along with its companion statue, Spirit of the American Navy. The original Doughboy statue was completed in 1921 while Viquesney was living in Americus, Georgia and is located in Nashville, Georgia. However, it was the second to be installed, and about the 25th to be formally dedicated. The first completed installation was at Furman University in Greenville, South Carolina. The statue in Spencer, Indiana, the sculptor's hometown, was not dedicated until May 29, 1927. Statuettes The statue also sparked an interior decorating fad in the 1920s. The design was so popular that Viquesney manufactured replica pot metal statuettes by the thousands. Also available were Doughboy lamps, which were made from the 12\\" statuettes (the Doughboy held a light bulb and lampshade in his raised hand), candlesticks, plaques, a smaller 6\\" version of the statuette, as well as less expensive plaster versions. The statuettes and lamps were made from 1921 to 1925 in Americus, Georgia, and continued to be produced in Spencer, Indiana until at least the late 1930s. With the passage of time and changes in fashion, many of these items were lost, broken, or discarded, making those few remaining in good condition sought after by modern collectors. In Helena, Arkansas Variations on the theme Another statue, created as a companion to the Doughboy, was entitled Spirit of the American Navy. This version depicted a sailor in a working uniform holding his cover aloft in his right hand. Far less popular than the Doughboy, only seven were made. All the known Navy statues are installed as part of a set along with a Doughboy statue, or occur nearby, as one of each at the ends of a bridge. Another version, holding a large artillery shell with both hands instead of waving his cap, appears in a 1926 Friedley-Voshardt catalog.Carol Grissom, Senior Artifacts Conservator, Smithsonian Institution (page 246 of the catalog). The only stone version of the Spirit of the American Navy is found in Crowell, Texas according to a Nov. 2, 2011 article by Daniel Walker in The Vernon Daily Record. The Smithsonian lists only six under the correct title (the seventh being listed along with the Doughboy at Kingman, Arizona). One, located in Palatka, Florida, is actually a different version of the statue said to have been created by sculptor Ray Fernandez, although no reference to any sculptor by that name exists in either the Smithsonian Art Inventories Catalogue or the AskART.com database. Viquesney's 1936 list shows \\"2 Doughboys, 2 Sailors\\", reinforcing the likelihood that Viquesney's \\"2+2\\" brochure claim was a typo, since all four statues (the two \\"standard\\" Doughboys, the Sailor, and a variant design Doughboy), were all dedicated at Palatka on November 11, 1927, according to newspaper articles. A Smithsonian reference to the Palatka variant Doughboy states that it may possibly have been sculpted by Gutzon Borglum. There is no proof of this, although Viquesney's self-written obituary boasts that \\"he knew Borglum\\". Other variants were designed by Viquesney to depict different doughboy poses, but very few got past the drawing stage and none were ever realized at full scale. The largest variant actually known to be by Viquesney is a unique three-foot memorial in Lakemore, Ohio, also listed as The Spirit of the Doughboy by the Smithsonian. It was copyrighted in 1930 and dedicated in 1938. No full-sized Viquesney doughboys in any pose other than the original have been confirmed to exist. New information and photographs confirm this piece is actually titled Resting Doughboy and was copyrighted in 1936.

Founded in 1913 and based in Dallas, approximately 50,000 youth and 15,000 adults participate in Scouting through the council each year. The council has four camps - Camp Wisdom, Camp James Ray, Clements Scout Ranch / Camp Trevor Rees-Jones and Camp Constantin / Jack D. Furst Aquatics Base.

In 1923 the council came into possession of its first camp. Donated by John S. Wisdom, also known as \\"Daddy Wisdom\\", to support the council he gave his farm as a permanent campsite. Since Wisdom's generous act, Circle Ten has acquired three more major camps: Constantin, James Ray, and Cherokee. J.L. Tarr, the Scout Executive of Circle Ten became Chief Scout Executive in 1979. In 1996 Circle 10 moved into its new home, The John D. Murchison Service Center, named after the National BSA President and Dallas area businessman/philanthropist who died in 1979 during the first year of his term.Brief history of the BSA 1972‚Äì1979 Camps Circle Ten Council operates six year-round camping grounds and three summer camps. Camp Constantin Constantin Aquatics area Camp Constantin is the flagship campground for Circle Ten. Located on on the shores of Possum Kingdom Lake near Graford, Texas and containing 15 campsites, Constantin acts as both a regular camp open to Boy Scouts from all areas and as Circle 10's largest and longest-running summer camp hosting roughly 2,800 Scouts during the 5 weeks it is open during the summer. Constantin was acquired by the Boy Scouts in 1946 when Eugene Constantin donated it, after the death of his son in World War II, to the group that he decided best served the needs, morals, and values of young men. The camp recently celebrated its 60th birthday and regularly plays host to International Scouts, most notably Scouting Ireland.Circle 10 page on Constantin =Jack D. Furst Aquatics Base= Within Camp Constantin is a sea Aquatics Base that was established by a generous donation from Circle Ten board member and former Constantin epitome staff member Jack D. Furst. The Aquatics area is the best maintained and most used Aquatics area within Circle Ten Council and one of the best in Texas. The Aquatics Base features a fleet of sailboats (consisting mainly of Sunfish and Hobie Cats), dozens of newly donated canoes, 5 ski boats, a two-year-old state-of-the-art swim dock, and a boat dock. Another popular feature are the \\"Blob\\" set out every summer. Because of Fursts' generosity and the area upkeep by epitome staff members, it is able to offer the Swimming, Rowing & Canoeing, Motorboating, Lifesaving, Kayaking, Sailing & Advanced Sailing, and Waterskiing merit badges as well as Lifeguard training. Its Water Odyssey program is unique to the camp and is designed solely for Eagle Scouts. James Ray Scout Reservation James Ray Scout Reservation, formerly known as Camp Grayson (1930‚Äì1999), is located on the Texas side of Lake Texoma, near Pottsboro, occupying . Like Constantin, James Ray is a year-round camp and a summer camp. During the summer months, James Ray utilizes its 12 campsites and is in operation for 4 weeks for Webelos resident camp. During the 2005 summer, James Ray suffered a setback when a refrigerator fire damaged its electrical system. Some dedicated Circle Ten volunteers repaired the electrical system, which was back in operation within 48 hours. James Ray is home to the Sanford Aquatics Area which contains a 180,000 gallon, one-of-a-kind swimming pool. In and surrounding the pool is a beach-front entrance, two aqua jet systems, and a water slide.Circle 10 page on James Ray Camp Wisdom Camp Wisdom is Circle Ten Council's original camp. Donated in 1923 by farmer John S. Wisdom, still known by his nickname \\"Daddy Wisdom\\", Camp Wisdom started at about . At one point, the camp grew to almost through land donations. Some of the original camp was purchased by Texas for the construction of Interstate 20. Since then, Wisdom has returned to much of its original size. Wisdom is known for Cub World, Circle Ten's primary Cub leader training site and Cub Scout campground. In addition to its 40 campsites, Wisdom also hosts leadership training for adults and youth owing, in part, to the easy access from the Dallas metropolitan area. The camp lends its name to Camp Wisdom Road, a major east‚Äìwest road near the camp. Camp Wisdom has an unfortunate reputation of being noisy at all times due to proximity to two highways: Interstate 20 and Texas Spur 408. Also, lighted highway billboards shine into some campsites. Clements Scout Ranch Clements Scout Ranch houses two Boy Scout camps, Trevor Rees-Jones Scout Camp and Camp Meisenbach. Named after former Texas Governor Bill Clements, a lifelong supporter of the BSA, the ranch comprises of towering pines and four well-stocked fishing lakes.Circle 10 page on Cherokee & Meisenbach =Trevor Rees-Jones Scout Camp= Trevor Rees-Jones Scout Camp (formerly Camp Cherokee), located near Athens, Texas, has sixteen campsites for weekend and week-long summer camp visitors. TRJ hosts one of two COPE courses in the council and also features a climbing tower. The summer program also offers more than 60 merit badges, programs, and activities for Scouts and Scouters alike. TRJ's biggest draw is the horsemanship program, the only place within the Circle Ten Council to obtain the Horsemanship merit badge. In June 2008, Camp Cherokee opened the Jim Tarr Dining Hall, a air- conditioned facility that also features a state-of-the-art kitchen and a Scoutmaster's lounge. Another unique offering is the annual Winter Camp held there every winter from December 27 to 31. Like a summer camp, campers have the chance to earn merit badges, but unlike Summer Camp, campers must provide their own food. Mikanakawa Lodge staffs Winter Camp every year, presenting various Indian-themed events such as Pow wow's to campers and visitors in addition to performing the normal duties of camp staffers. =Camp Meisenbach= Camp Meisenbach (formerly Camp Comanche) is the smaller of the two camps located on Clements Scout Ranch and is used exclusively for year- round camping. Meisenbach features six campsites with two pavilions. Located on Murchison Lake, Meisenbach offers great fishing and canoeing programs. Camp Meisenbach currently has of hiking trails and three additional Philmont style campsites. Clements Scout Ranch is also very proud to host the \\"Governor's Trail\\", which has recently been renovated with a service grant from the National Order of the Arrow lodge. Programs and activities Circle Ten Council has strong International Scouting ties, particularly with Scouting Ireland with whom they have set up a Scouting exchange program every summer. In the summer of 2005, a composite troop from Ireland toured the three Circle Ten summer camps and stayed with foster families for a time in Dallas. In 2006 Scouts from Circle Ten visited Larch Hill and went hiking and camping with Irish Scouts in the Southern part of Ireland. An Irish contingent is planned for 2007 with a return trip by Circle Ten already planned for 2008. Order of the Arrow Mikanakawa Lodge is the local extension of the Order of the Arrow within Circle Ten. It was founded in 1937 by L. L.Hotchkiss after Scouts from Circle Ten Council came back from the 1937 National Scout Jamboree. On April 26 Hotchkiss, himself a distinguished Arrowman, mailed a letter to the National OA Secretary about starting a Lodge. On June 22, final approval for the lodge was given and within seven days of the letter, the first Ordeal was held at Camp Wisdom. The lodge gained its name when the Mikanakawa Tribe, a group of Scouts acting outside of the Order of the Arrow but with similar activities, was merged by Circle Ten into the official Order of the Arrow lodge and allowed to keep the name Mikanakawa. The Lodge lacked the traditional \\"patch flap\\" until 1950 when it was designed by Bill Jordan in preparation for a trip to a National meeting. In 1994 the Mikanakawa Lodge acquired the Okiciyapi Lodge. Okiciyapi was allowed to keep its totem making Mikinakawa one of the few OA Lodges in the country to have two totems: the owl and the thunderbird.I go to prepare a trail for you by Peter McNabb The lodge holds many events, including five annual ordeals, a Native American Pow-Wow, a Fall Fellowship, Annual Dinner, a leadership development conference and is charged each year with organizing and staffing the council's winter camp at Camp Trevor Rees-Jones (formerly known as Camp Cherokee). The lodge also sends delegates to the annual Southern Region Section 2 Conclave and regularly sends at least 100 delegates to National Order of the Arrow Conference (NOAC) Chapters The lodge is administratevly divided into chapters matching each district: Southwestern Service Area 1\\\\.

It comprised various DJs and MCs, the most notable being DJ Shadow, MC‚Äìproducer Lyrics Born, and the duo, Blackalicious. The members of Solesides all met via the radio station, KDVS, the 5000-watt community radio station of the University of California at Davis. During high school, Davis-natives DJ Shadow (a.k.a. Josh Davis) and The 8th Wonder (a.k.a. Stan Green) used to frequent the station to support Orus Washington's hip-hop show. In college, journalist and then-grad student Jeff Chang (a.k.a. DJ Zen), broadcast a weekly hip-hop radio show that got the attention of DJ Shadow and The 8th Wonder, freshmen Xavier Mosely (Chief Xcel), Tom Shimura (Lyrics Born) and Joseph Patel (a.k.a. Jazzbo). They all shared a like-minded passion for hip-hop that pushed beyond the sounds of mainstream commercial music. In 1991, the six came together to form a collective of artists and hip-hop lovers, naming the label SoleSides. The first release, was a 12\\" single, numbered \\"SS001,\\" featuring DJ Shadow's instrumental odyssey, \\"Entropy\\" on one side and Lyrics Born (then known as Asia Born) on the other side with the song, \\"Send Them.\\" The white-label 12\\" was preceded by a cassette single version of the release and both have fetched high dollars in the re-sale market. Only 400 cassettes and 200 12\\" vinyl singles were originally pressed up and sold on consignment in record stores in the Bay Area. In 1996 the label won a \\"Goldie\\" award from the San Francisco Bay Guardian, being described as \\"Both a progressive crew of deejays and rappers and a fiercely independent artist- owned label...\\". The label produced some of the most notable and memorable hip-hop music of the early 1990s including Blackalicious's \\"Melodica\\", Latyrx's \\"The Album\\" and DJ Shadow's \\"Entropy\\". Solesides disbanded in the winter of 1996, and was reborn as Quannum Projects in spring of 1997.

Millerandage (or shot berries, hens and chicks and pumpkins and peas) is a potential viticultural hazard problem in which grape bunches contain berries that differ greatly in size and, most importantly, maturity. Its most common cause is cold, rainy or otherwise bad weather during the flowering stage of the vines though other factors, such as boron deficiency or fanleaf degeneration, may also play a role.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pgs 77, 291, 322, 443 Oxford University Press 2006 While millerandage will always cause a drop in yield, its potential impact on wine quality will vary, particularly by grape variety. For some varieties that are prone to uneven ripeness within a cluster, such as Sangiovese, Zinfandel and Gew√ºrztraminer, the development of millerandage may be unfavorable due to \\"green flavors\\" from the potentially unripe grapes hidden within the cluster. For other varieties, such as Pinot noir or the Mendoza clone of Chardonnay, wine quality could be improved due to the reduced overall berry size and higher skin to juice ratio.  Causes  During the flowering (inflorescence) stage, cool temperature and the presence of rain can influence the development of millerandage. The root cause of millerandage is the poor fertilization of grape flowers during the growing season. While this is most often attributed to bad weather, other factors such as nutritional deficiencies (particularly of the mineral boron which is needed to synthesis the growth hormone auxin and facilitate the movement of sugars in the vine) or viral infections can play a role.  Flowering and fruit set  For grapevines, flowering occurs usually 8 weeks after the beginning of bud break when the mean daily temperatures hit around . Usually flowering begins at the base of the inflorescence (cluster of flowers) and moves its way to the top. Following the apical dominance of grape vines, the uppermost shoots of the vine will begin flowering first with complete blooming taking place over 7 to 10 days. Ideally the temperature and weather condition for this period should be warm, sunny and dry to insure optimal flowering. For some varieties, such as Zinfandel and Merlot, flowering may be more staggered which poses a greater risk for inclemental weather disrupting the process and encouraging millerandage. Some growers may try to encourage more synchronized flowering with the use of chemical treatments, such as cyanamide.R. Jackson \\"Wine Science: Principles and Applications\\" Third Edition pgs 70-72 Academic Press 2008 Following flowering, the flowers of the grape vine go through pollination and fertilization over the next 2 to 3 days. Here is another opportunity where incremental weather can influence the outcome with temperature drops below potentially damaging the ovules of the flowers before they can be fertilized. Since grapevines are hermaphroditic (containing both male and female parts) and usually rely on self-pollination, the presence of wind to circulate pollen or insects usually doesn't influence the success or failure of the pollination stage. While not as influential as temperature, the presence of rain can \\"wash off\\" the pollen from the stigma or greatly dilute the stigmatic fluid, causing the pollen to absorb too much water, swelling and bursting before it reaches the ovules.Winkler AJ, Cook JA, Kliere WM and Lider LA General Viticulture 2nd Edition, pgw 126-133 University of California Press. 1974 . Grapes that develop millerandage will not have seeds, making them smaller and with potentially a higher juice to skin ratio which may be desirable in winemaking. However, these smaller berries may not fully ripen and could potentially add high acid and \\"green\\" flavors to the wine. Even in the most ideal conditions, usually only 20-30% of flowers develop into mature fruit with fully developed seeds and auxin production. If even fewer berries develop, the condition of coulure emerges while for developed berries, the number of seeds (or their absence) will influence the resulting size of the berries. Millerandge most often occurs when the partially fertilized grapes do not develop any seeds, leaving small (and potentially immature) berries present in a cluster of larger, otherwise mature berries.  Influence on wine quality  While millerandage will always have an economic impact in reduced harvest yields, it may not always have a negative impact on the resulting quality of the wine. In some areas, such as the New World wine regions of Australia, California and New Zealand, the presence of millerandage in the a vineyard can be seen as a positive quality for a vintage due to the reduced average berry-size. Some growers will even use chemical sprays to deliberately encourage millerandage.T. Stevenson, ed. The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia (5th Edition) pg 23 Dorling Kindersley (2011) However, the small, seedless berries may never fully ripen and stay hard and green (with high acid) throughout the growing season. Some growers may choose to remove clusters with high preponderance of millerandge through green harvesting or choose to harvest the entirety of the crop later at higher ripeness levels to balance the high acid and potentially \\"green flavors\\" of the shot berries. Other growers will remove the grape post-harvest at a sorting table along with other MOG.Clive Coates An Encyclopedia of the Wines and Domaines of France pgs 16 & 520 University of California Press; First Printing edition (June 2001)  References  Category:Viticulture Category:Grape diseases ","title":"Millerandage"},{"id":"4240593","text":"Lochluichart railway station is a railway station on the Kyle of Lochalsh Line, serving the village of Lochluichart in the north of Scotland.

On 3 May 1954 a new station was opened as Lochluichart as a result of a hydro electric scheme raising the level of Loch Luichart, constructed of red sandstone. The deviation required about on stone- pitched embankments and in rock cuttings, a bridge over the River Conon and a bridge.

He played forward for the University of Wisconsin from 1903 to 1905. He was college basketball's leading scorer in the game's first 25 years from 1895 to 1920. He became known as the \\"Father of Wisconsin Basketball\\" and was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1961. Early years Steinmetz was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1882. He was the son of Chris, a Milwaukee real estate man, and Frances Steinmetz. Steinmetz attended Milwaukee's South Division High School where he was a member of the school's basketball and track teams. He led South Division to the state high school basketball championship in 1902 and was the state champion in the high jump that year. University of Wisconsin Steinmetz enrolled at the University of Wisconsin where he was a member of the Badgers' track and basketball teams from 1903 to 1905. Despite his modest size at and , he became one of the greatest scorers in basketball history. One writer who saw him play wrote: \\"He was a human dynamo on the basketball floor. Possessed of an uncanny eye for the basket and a bulldog on defense, Steinmetz always seemed to be at the right place at the right time. He was to basketball what Willie Heston (of Michigan) was to football.\\" Evolution of the game Steinmetz was credited with being an innovator in technique. In an era when the underhand, two-handed shot was the norm, Steinmetz often used a \\"one-hander.\\" Steinmetz later recalled that the one-hander was \\"always good for three or four baskets before they caught on to it.\\" He also had the ability to rebound or catch a pass and shoot while in the air, \\"a feat that was unheard of in those days.\\" In 1958, Steinmetz told a reporter that the modern game was as different from the game he played as \\"hearts is from poker.\\" He concluded that the biggest change in the game was eliminating the \\"center jump,\\" in which there was a jump ball at center court after every score. He noted: \\"It makes basketball a percentage game. Whichever team is hitting for the best percentage of their shots wins. It used to be that the good team would get the ball again in the center jump and one team would pull farther ahead of the other.\\" Steinmetz played on the 1905 Wisconsin basketball team with College Football Hall of Fame coach Bob Zuppke and recalled that the game was rougher in its early days: \\"Zuppke and I played nine games in 10 nights, and were in every minute. Basketball in those days was football for lighter fellows. The officials allowed rougher play. Why, we wore moleskin pants or they would have tore them right off you the way they hung on.\\" 1903 and 1904 seasons 1903 Wisconsin basketball team (Steinmetz in middle holding ball) Basketball was in its infancy at the University of Wisconsin when Steinmetz arrived. The team was jokingly called the \\"squat tag team,\\" had no coach and received no financial support from the university. Players supplied their own equipment, and Steinmetz later recalled the worn condition of the balls they had to use: \\"We seldom saw a new ball. The ones we used had lumps and corners on them.\\" In 1904, Emmett Angell became the coach of the basketball team. The Badgers lost to Nebraska 24‚Äì22 for the western championship. Steinmetz recalled that Wisconsin lost the game when \\"a fan sitting right on the edge of the court grabbed our guard's arm and kept him from throwing the ball in as time ran out.\\" Steinmetz noted that they were running a set play in which Steinmetz would break down court, and Zuppke would throw a long, lead pass to him. After the fan's illegal participation, a \\"free-for-all battle\\" broke out, and Nebraska was declared the winner. 1905 season As a senior in 1905, Steinmetz was the captain of a 1905 Wisconsin team won that all of its games against western teams and claimed the western championship with a 29‚Äì24 win over Amos Alonzo Stagg's University of Chicago basketball team. The team lost the national championship in a three-hour game against Columbia in New York. A controversy surrounded the loss to Columbia, as Columbia insisted over Wisconsin's objection in using its own umpire and referee. The Wisconsin players complained that fouls by the Columbia players were overlooked, and Steinmetz had his jaw broken in the game. Further complicating matters, Columbia and Wisconsin played under different rules, and the game took three hours to finish because of arguments over the rules. Steinmetz later recalled that he carried a rule book in his pocket during the game. Also, Columbia's baskets had no backboards and instead consisted of hoops mounted on poles, which the Columbia players shook when Wisconsin shot the ball. Despite the broken jaw, Steinmetz scored 11 of Wisconsin's 14 points in a 25‚Äì14 loss. The Columbia game was part of a nine-game eastern trip. Steinmetz had received advance publicity and was being closely guarded. At Rochester University, Bob Zuppke suggested that he take Steinmetz' place at forward to confuse the opposition. After the center jump, Steinmetz joined Zuppke at the forward spot. \\"We got several baskets before the other team woke up and made the necessary adjustment.\\" During the 18-game 1905 season, Steinmetz averaged 25.7 points per game on a team that averaged 37.8 points per game. He set scoring records, some of which remain Wisconsin records: most points in a game (50 points against Sparta), most points in a season (462 points in 18 games), most free throws in a game (26 against Two Rivers), most free throws in a season (238), and most free throw attempts in a season (317). Steinmetz's single-game, free-throw record, set at a time when one player took all of the team's free throws, has never been broken. He scored 20 field goals in a game against Beloit College, falling one basket short of the national record. He later recalled, \\"The game was stopped five minutes early so Beloit could catch a train. Otherwise I might have had another record.\\" He left Wisconsin with a career total of 962 points, a school record that stood for 40 years. In Wisconsin's 1905 Badger yearbook, Steinmetz wrote about the team's championship season: > The team began its season by overwhelmingly defeating various teams > throughout the State, and its first championship game was played against > Beloit College. In our own gymnasium we defeated her by the large score of > 80 to 10, and it was this game that furnished a criterion as to how strong a > team Wisconsin really had. During our invasion of the East we played a > longer and harder schedule than any university team had ever attempted. > Playing the strongest and best teams of the East and under a very different > interpretation of the basketball rules, we were able to make an excellent > showing. Columbia University, the Eastern intercollegiate champions, > defeated us by a score of 21 to 15 in a hard fought game and not until the > last minutes of play did she wrest the game from our grasp. Although no such award existed at the time, the Helms Foundation later selected a College Basketball Player of the Year for each year dating back to 1905. Steinmetz was named the Player of the Year for 1905. He was the first person selected to receive the Player of the Year award, and 1905 was the first year for which a recipient was selected. Later years After graduating, Steinmetz became a lawyer, practicing in Milwaukee for 50 years. He was active in coaching and officiating basketball for several years. For 19 years, Steinmetz selected the All-Western basketball team for Spalding's Official Basketball Guide. Steinmetz was recognized with multiple honors in his later years. In 1954, he was honored as the \\"Father of Wisconsin Basketball\\" at a testimonial dinner at the Milwaukee Athletic Club. At the time, Milwaukee Sentinel sports editor said, \\"we are honoring one of the great guys in the history of Milwaukee, Wisconsin and the South Side.\\" He was inducted into the Helms Foundation Hall of Fame in 1957, the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 1958, and the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1961. At the induction into the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame, Steinmetz quipped, \\"I won't have to talk about my records. Modesty forbids. They speak for themselves.\\" He also joked about having been overlooked in prior years: \\"I'd been waiting for it since the first election of the board. The hardest thing I had to do was sit there and wait to be called.\\" Steinmetz married Bessie Engel in November 1908. They had three sons, Christian, Allan and Don, and one daughter, Ruth. All three sons played varsity basketball for the University of Wisconsin, and all three became lawyers. At the time of his induction into the Helms Foundation's Basketball Hall of Fame, Steinmetz said that he was proudest of the fact that \\"I had three sons who won basketball letters at Wisconsin. When we're all home that makes four of us at the table and you don't find many tables like that.\\" Steinmetz suffered a stroke in 1962 and a second stroke in 1963. He died at St. Luke's Hospital in Milwaukee three weeks after the second stroke at age 80.

The ‚Äòcontinuing‚Äô organizations may be old or the split between the parent Church and the Continuing Church may be recent. Terminology The term Continuing Church has been used by a number of Christian denominations formed in response to a variety of doctrinal disagreements between members. The use of this term is meant to suggest that no new doctrines were being promoted by the dissenters, but rather that the historic faith allegedly abandoned by the parent body was being preserved‚Äîor continued‚Äîin these newly founded churches. Examples of Continuing Churches Examples of Continuing Churches include the Free Church of England (1844), Presbyterian Church in America (1973), Continuing Anglican Movement (1977), Reformed Presbyterian Church General Assembly (1991), the Episcopal Missionary Church (1992), and the Free Church of Scotland (continuing) (2000). In the USA, the ordination of women beginning in the 1970s played a major part in the formation of a number of Continuing Churches, as did Fundamentalist and Evangelical convictions. The Southern Methodist Church (1940) and the Evangelical Church (1968), for example, were both bodies which refused to join with the Methodist Church the United Methodist Church, respectively, on grounds of theology and polity. And there are many remnants of the former Congregationalist denominations which now comprise the United Church of Christ merger, such as the Conservative Congregational Christian Conference (1948). The North American Baptist landscape is replete with organizations that originate from a refusal to join a larger body. In Australia, both Fellowship of Congregational Churches and the Presbyterian Church of Australia continued after the Uniting Church in Australia formed in 1977. Apostolic succession Continuing Churches with a Catholic or Anglican tradition have sometimes found it difficult to manage the initial separation in that there are a limited number of Anglicans or Roman Catholics who have passed on valid Apostolic succession. Prior to the 1970s, ‚ÄòContinuing Churches‚Äô often approached English speaking Old Catholics to obtain Apostolic Succession and to place themselves within the historic episcopacy. This means that although such churches may have continued the beliefs and practices of Anglicanism, they have Apostolic Succession through the Old Catholic bishops Arnold Harris Matthew or Rudolphe De Landas Berghes. Most Continuing Anglican churches, however, descend from the \\"Denver Consecrations\\" of 1978 in which the consecrators were bishops in good standing in the Anglican Communion. Theology ‚ÄòContinuing Churches‚Äô are frequently less tolerant of doctrinal diversity than the parent Church and claim that they hold on to an 'orthodox' position. The separation of the ‚Äòcontinuing‚Äô Church from the parent body often leads to a position of conflict between the two organisations. References * The Measure of A Bishop: The Episcopi Vagantes.

and is 15 km from Cape Town. Its name is a contraction of igugu lethu, which is Xhosa for our pride. The township was established along with Nyanga in the 1960s.  Geography  The main route, Steve Biko Drive (formerly known as NY1), runs through the township. The town planners did not give names to any of the roads, all were simply numbered. NY1 stood for \\"Native Yard 1\\",Letter to The Cape Times from Ed Coombe, 26 September 2012. Gugulethu at the time not having been named as such and being considered simply as an extension of the adjoining township of Nyanga. There has been strong pressure for the NY terminology to be dropped and for the streets to be renamed. This resulted in the City of Cape Town renaming NY1 as Steve Biko Drive in September 2012. The renaming process continues and the City recently announced that streets will be named after, amongst others, Albert Luthuli, Amy Biehl, Ray Alexander, and the \\"Gugulethu Seven\\" (the latter being a group who were fatally ambushed by security police in Gugulethu in 1986). Currently, all the streets have new names, but the NY terminology is still predominant as residents are used to it.  History  The name is a contraction of igugu lethu, which is Xhosa for our pride. Gugulethu, along with Nyanga, was established in the 1960s due to the overcrowding of Langa, which was the only black residential area for Cape Town at the time. During the Apartheid era black South Africans were not permitted to live in the city of Cape Town, and many people were removed from areas such as District Six to Gugulethu, Nyanga, and Langa. The predominant language in Gugulethu is Xhosa. Gugulethu is passionately called or referred to as \\"Gugs\\" by the locals, which is a nickname stemming from the shortening of the name Gugulethu. Black residents living in Windermere were forcibly moved to Gugulethu when it was declared a black township. Windermere was declared by Apartheid regime to be a colored area. Gugulethu was one of the first townships in Cape Town to have a community information technology Center to provide training in multimedia and youth development.  Places of interest  The 'Gugulethu Seven Memorial' was built to commemorate the life of seven activists that were ambushed and killed by the South African security forces on March 3, 1986. The activists were members of uMkhonto weSizwe, the armed wing of the African National Congress (ANC). The seven murdered were Jabulani Godfery Miya, Zandisile Zenith Mjobo, Zola Alfred Swelani, Mandla Simon Mxinwa, Themba Mlifi, Zabonke, John Konile, and Christopher Piet. On Human Rights Day 2000, the memorial was unveiled. *The Cape Town Jazz Safari is a tour which highlights musical history and jazz in Gugulethu. *Gugulethu Square was created in 2009 as a central business district in the township. *Gugulethu Indoor Sports Complex is an indoor all year round community facility. *Mzoli is a Tshisa Nyama in Gugulethu.

The incident became known as The Gugulethu Seven. The seven men were: Zandisile Zenith Mjobo, Zola Alfred Swelani, Mandla Simon Mxinwa, Godfrey Jabulani Miya, Themba Mlifi, Zabonke John Konile and Christopher \\"Rasta\\" Piet. They were members of the military wing of the African National Congress known as Umkhonto we Sizwe. *In 2017, Major-General Andre Lincoln stated during his testimony while under cross-examination in the Western Cape High Court that police officers removed evidence from the scenes of government-ordered crimes such as The Gugulethu Seven in the 1980s. *In August 1993, Gugulethu was the site of the violent murder of a young white American woman, Amy Biehl, in the upheaval following the official end of apartheid and before the multi-racial election of 1994. In 1998, four men were convicted of Amy's murder. They were pardoned by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Ms. Biehl's family supported the release of the four men. They started the Amy Biehl Foundation Trust in the townships to work with youth. The foundation's goal to empower young disadvantaged youth by using education and culture to deter crime and drugs. An Amy Biehl Memorial site was created in Gugulethu and tours into the township to see the memorial and visit some of the schools where programs were created by the Amy Biehl Foundation. *In November 2010, Swedish tourist Anni Dewani was murdered in Gugulethu while on her honeymoon. Anni Dewani's husband became a suspect in the trial of her murder. He fought a three and a half year battle against extradition to South Africa.

Since 2007 he has been Board of Governors Professor of Philosophy at Rutgers University, but he spent most of his career at Brown University.  Education and career  Born in C√°rdenas, Cuba, on June 17, 1940,The dictionary of modern American philosophers, Volume 1 by Richard T. Hull, Continuum International Publishing Group, 2005, p.2287. Sosa earned his BA and MA from the University of Miami and his PhD from the University of Pittsburgh in 1964. His dissertation was supervised by Nicholas Rescher. He joined the Rutgers faculty in 2007, having taught at Brown University since 1964. While full-time at Brown, he was also a distinguished visiting professor at Rutgers every spring from 1998 to 2006. Sosa has been described as \\"one of the most important epistemologists of the last half- century.\\"https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/23005-ernest-sosa-and-his-critics/ Sosa is a past president of the American Philosophical Association and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts & Sciences. He edits the philosophical journals No√ªs and Philosophy and Phenomenological Research. In 2005 he delivered the John Locke Lectures at Oxford, which formed the basis of his 2007 book. Sosa received the 2010 Nicholas Rescher Prize for contributions to systematic philosophy, conferred by the University of Pittsburgh biennially.http://www.news.pitt.edu/news/philosopher-ernest-sosa-inaugural- recipient-pitt%E2%80%99s-prestigious-rescher-prize His son, David Sosa, is a professor and chair of the philosophy department at the University of Texas, Austin.  Philosophical work  In addition to epistemology, Sosa has also written on metaphysics, modern philosophy and philosophy of mind. In his books Knowledge in Perspective (1991) and A Virtue Epistemology (2007), he defends a form of virtue epistemology called \\"virtue perspectivism\\", which distinguishes animal knowledge from reflective knowledge. Virtue epistemology \\"Contemporary virtue epistemology, conceived as such and as a distinctive movement within epistemology, began with Ernest Sosa‚Äôs work in the early 1980s.\\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology-virtue/#PrecContOrig Virtue epistemology is characterized by two features: against W. V. O. Quine, it views \\"epistemology as a normative discipline\\" and \\"intellectual agents and communities as the primary focus of epistemic evaluation, with a focus on the intellectual virtues and vices embodied in and expressed by these agents and communities.\\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology-virtue/  Metaphysics (composition)  Absolutism and Its \\"explosion\\" In \\"Existential Relativity,\\" Sosa considers theories of composition. He calls ordinary theories of composition absolutism, which has objects as existing absolutely when compositional conditions are fulfilled in the object. Objects exist when certain stuff is arranged in a certain way. Absolutism leads to what Sosa coins an \\"explosion\\" of entities in that an indeterminate number overlap at a location and any change destroys and creates an indeterminate number of others. Sosa provides an illustration to motivate this problem. A snowball is made of a piece of snow in a \\"round\\" (spherical) shape and follows certain persistence conditions. Sosa introduces the concept of a \\"snowdiscall.\\" A snowdiscall is \\"constituted by a piece of snow as matter and as form any shape between round [spherical] and being disc-shaped.\\"Ibid., 652 On this definition, a snowball is also a snowdiscall, but a snowdiscall is not necessarily a snowball. So there are two distinct objects that overlap. But just as there is a snowdiscall, there can be an indeterminate number of other objects: objects between round and 50% disc-shaped, objects between round and 30% disc-shaped, etc. These are distinct, existing objects and not just arbitrary descriptions. What seems to be arbitrary in absolutism is the idea that one object (the snowball) has more claim to existence than the others. Existential relativism: As a potential solution, Sosa advances existential relativism. The central claim is that objects do not exist objectively as if some \\"[c]onstituted, supervenient entities [. . .] objectively supervene[d] on their requisite constitutive matters and forms.\\"Ibid., 653 On existential relativism, composition is relative to a conceptual scheme. Conceptual schemes are mental collections of ideas of how the world exists and interacts. They can differ based on language, culture, personal utility, perspective, etc. A person's conceptual scheme helps select the things in the external world that resemble these mental ideas and then confers existence on them.Ibid., 653 Since conceptual schemes can differ, different persons may recognize different objects. Conceptual schemes are chosen based on how useful they are to the individual in understanding the world. Sosa's working definition of existential relativism: \\"that what exists relative to our present scheme O is what it recognizes directly, what it recognizes indirectly through its predecessors or successors, and what it would recognize if we had developed appropriately or were to do so now, and had been or were to be appropriately situated.\\"Ibid., 654 This definition allows for objects to exist if a conceptual scheme recognizes them, recognizes something that entails another object's existence, or would have recognized them if people had different capacities or spatiotemporal locations. Sosa's anticipated objections:Ibid., 654-658 * Objection 1: Would composition occur in a world without persons? * Objection 2: Aren't \\"snowdiscalls\\" simply an arbitrary, superficial classification of an object (e.g. any cat or dog could be a \\"caog\\" without ontological problems)? *Objection 3: Is existential relativism redundant if things exist externally in a certain way and are just recognized by a conceptual scheme? Is existential relativism just absolutism with an emphasis on human perception of the world? *Objection 4: Is existential relativity a linguistic theory (concerned with how to describe the world as indexed to a person) and not an ontological theory? How are disagreements between opposing conceptual schemes settled? *Objection 5: Could atoms (or other fundamental particles) exist simpliciter while other objects (e.g. hammers, cats, snowballs) exist relative to conceptual schemes?

Hussars (previously the 13th Light Dragoons) was a cavalry regiment of the British Army established in 1715. It saw service for three centuries including the Napoleonic Wars, the Crimean War and the First World War but then amalgamated with the 18th Royal Hussars, to form the 13th/18th Royal Hussars in 1922. History Uniform of the 13th Light Dragoons Early wars The regiment was raised in the Midlands by Richard Munden as Richard Munden‚Äôs Regiment of Dragoons in 1715 as part of the response to the Jacobite rebellion. It took part in the Battle of Preston in November 1715 after which it escorted the rebels to the nearest prisons.Cannon, p. 10 The regiment was sent to Ireland in 1718 and remained there until 1742.Cannon, p. 12 During the 1745 Jacobite Rising, it was commanded by James Gardiner; largely composed of recruits, on 16 September the regiment was routed by a small party of Highlanders in the so-called 'Coltbridge Canter.' Demoralised by this, it did the same at the Battle of Prestonpans on 21 September, which lasted 15 minutes and where Gardiner was killed and the equally disastrous Battle of Falkirk Muir in January 1746. Shortly after this, Gardiner's replacement Francis Ligonier died of sickness and was replaced by Philip Naison. The regiment returned to Ireland in 1749Cannon, p. 20 and was re-titled the 13th Regiment of Dragoons in 1751. It was involved in putting down a minor rebellion by George Robert FitzGerald in 1781Cannon, p. 24 and it converted to the light role in 1783. A detachment from the regiment was sent to Jamaica in September 1795Cannon, p. 28 and returned in July 1798.Cannon, p. 30 Peninsular War Members of the 13th attack French horse artillery at Albueara (from a book published in 1895) In February 1810 the regiment sailed for Lisbon for service in the Peninsular War.Cannon, p. 34 It took part in the Battle of Campo Maior on the Spanish-Portuguese border on 25 March 1811 in a clash that occurred between British and Portuguese cavalry, under Robert Ballard Long, and a force of French infantry and cavalry under General Latour-Maubourg. The regiment, two and a half squadrons strong, led by Colonel Michael Head, charged and routed a superior French cavalry force of no less than six squadrons.Cannon, p. 42 The regiment, with two Portuguese squadrons, then went on to pursue the French for seven miles to the outskirts of Badajoz.Cannon, p.44 The report reaching Lord Wellington seems to have glossed over the epic quality of the charge and emphasised the overlong pursuit. After receiving Marshal Beresford's report, Wellington issued a particularly harsh reprimand to the regiment calling them \\"a rabble\\" and threatening to remove their horses from them and send the regiment to do duty at Lisbon. The officers of the regiment then wrote a collective letter to Wellington detailing the particulars of the action. Wellington is reported as saying that had he known the full facts he would never have issued the reprimand.Fletcher, pp. 136-137. The historian Sir John Fortescue wrote, \\"Of the performance of Thirteenth, who did not exceed two hundred men, in defeating twice or thrice their numbers single-handed, it is difficult to speak too highly.\\"Fletcher, p. 140. The regiment formed part of Beresford's Allied-Spanish Army at the Battle of Albuera on 16 May 1811.Cannon, p. 49 The French army, commanded by Marshal Jean-de-Dieu Soult, Duc de Dalmatie, was attempting to relieve the French garrison of the border fortress of Badajoz. Only after bloody and fierce fighting, and the steadfastness of the British infantry, did the allies carry the day. The regiment, which was unbrigaded, formed part of the cavalry force commanded initially by Brigadier Robert Ballard Long and, later in the battle, by Major General Sir William Lumley.Cannon, p. 50 The regiment also saw action at the Battle of Arroyo dos Molinos in October 1811,Cannon, p. 51 at the Siege of Badajoz in March 1812Cannon, p. 53 and, as part of the 2nd Brigade under Colonel Colquohon Grant, at the Battle of Vitoria in June 1813.Cannon, p. 57 The regiment advanced into France and fought at the Battle of the Nive in December 1813,Cannon, p. 59 at the Battle of Orthez in February 1814Cannon, p. 61 and at the Battle of Toulouse in April 1814.Cannon, p. 65 Waterloo Waterloo 1815. Lord Hill - \\"Drive them back 13th\\" The regiment, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Shapland Boyse and forming part of the 7th Cavalry Brigade, but operationally attached to the 5th Cavalry Brigade, next took part in the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815.Cannon, p. 68Adkin, pp. 217-218 The regiment charged repeatedly during the day and completely routed a square of French infantry.Cannon, p. 69 An officer of the 13th wrote: > Our last and most brilliant charge, was at the moment that Lord Hill, > perceiving the movement of the Prussian army, and finding the French > Imperial Guard on the point of forcing a part of the British position, cried > out, - \\"Drive them back, 13th!\\" such an order from such a man, could not be > misconstrued, and it was punctually obeyed. At that battle the armies of Field Marshal the Duke of Wellington and Generalfeldmarschall Gebhard Leberecht von Bl√ºcher decisively defeated the armies of the Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte.Cannon, p. 71 The Crimean War The charge of the Light Brigade, October 1854; The 13th Hussars were in the first line of cavalry (on the left of the picture) on the right flank (towards the back of the picture) Officers and men of the 13th Hussars-survivors of the Charge of the Light Brigade by Roger Fenton 1855 The regiment next saw action, as part of the light brigade under the command of Major General the Earl of Cardigan, at the Battle of Alma in September 1854. The regiment was in the first line of cavalry on the right flank during the Charge of the Light Brigade at the Battle of Balaclava in October 1854. The brigade drove through the Russian artillery before smashing straight into the Russian cavalry and pushing them back; it was unable to consolidate its position, however, having insufficient forces and had to withdraw to its starting position, coming under further attack as it did so. The regiment lost three officers and 38 men in the debacle. Lance-Sergeant Joseph Malone of the E Troop was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions during the battle. The regiment also took part in the Battle of Inkerman in November 1854: the regiment played a minor role, although Captain Jenyns complained: > They put us under a very heavy fire at Inkerman, but luckily for us - and no > thanks to any General - we had a slight rise on our flank, which ricocheted > the balls just over our heads. Some ship's shells bowled over a few men and > horses though. It was useless, as we could not act.Thomson, p. 181 Colonel Baden-Powell; the white collar and busby-bag were distinctive features of the uniform of the 13th Hussars The regiment went on to take part in the Siege of Sevastopol in winter 1854. On 8 April 1861 the regiment was renamed the 13th Hussars and in April 1862 the regiment started wearing hussar clothing. The regiment departed for Canada in September 1866 as part of the response to the Fenian raids and sailed for India in January 1874. Robert Baden-Powell, the future leader of the scouts, joined the regiment in India in 1876. The regiment served in Afghanistan but saw no action during the Second Anglo-Afghan War. The Second Boer War Rescuing a Drowning Trooper of the 13th Hussars at the Ferry Crossing (1902 Illustration) The regiment arrived in South Africa in December 1899 and took part in the Battle of Colenso during the Second Boer War. It formed part of Colonel Burn-Murdoch‚Äôs Brigade and had a minor part in the Relief of Ladysmith in February 1900. The regiment stayed in South Africa throughout the hostilities, which ended with the Peace of Vereeniging on 31 May 1902. Following the end of the war, 556 officers and men of the regiment left South Africa on the SS City of Vienna, which arrived at Southampton in October 1902. First World War 13th Hussars bivouacked in France, 1915 The regiment, which was based in Meerut in India at the start of the war, landed in Marseille as part of the 7th (Meerut) Cavalry Brigade in the 2nd Indian Cavalry Division in December 1914 for action on the Western Front. The regiment then moved to Mesopotamia, with the same brigade, in July 1916. The regiment took part in the Second Battle of Kut in February 1917, the capture of Baghdad in March 1917 and the Battle of Sharqat in October 1918. At Sharquat the regiment charged the hill where the Turkish guns were, and made a dismounted charge up it with fixed bayonets, successfully capturing the guns: ƒ∞smail Hakkƒ± Bey, the Turkish commander, was aware of the peace talks at Mudros, and decided to spare his men rather than fight or break out, surrendering on 30 October 1918.Erickson, p. 203. In 1922 the regiment amalgamated with the 18th Royal Hussars to form the 13th/18th Royal Hussars. Regimental museum The regimental collection is held by the Discovery Museum in Newcastle upon Tyne.

The station is from , and has a passing loop long, flanked by two platforms. Platform 1 on the up (eastbound) line can accommodate trains having three coaches, whereas platform 2 on the down (westbound) line can hold five.  History  Loco- hauled trains pass at Achnasheen, September 1973 The station was opened by the Dingwall and Skye Railway on 19 August 1870, but operated from the outset by the Highland Railway. The station hotel was built by Alexander Ross and opened in 1871. It was extended by William Roberts in 1898The Buildings of Scotland: Highlands: John Gifford. Yale University Press 2003. p.380 and again at the turn of the 21st century. Taken into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway during the Grouping of 1923, the line then passed on to the Scottish Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948. It was once an important railhead, handling passengers, mail and freight bound for parts of Wester Ross, including Gairloch and the Loch Torridon area. A proposal for a branch line to Aultbea, via Gairloch and Poolewe. Plans for the Loch Maree and Aultbea Railway was put to Parliament in 1893, but the proposal was rejected, as it deemed that the line would not be commercially viable in such a remote area. All freight in this area now travels by road. The station building still serves as a postal distribution point, but the mail travels from Inverness by road. When sectorisation was introduced by British Rail, the station became part of ScotRail until the Privatisation of British Rail. The station is the location of one of the three passing loops on the line west of and trains are sometimes timetabled to cross here. The loop was once controlled from signal boxes at each end of the station (a common method of working on the HR), but both were closed when Radio Electronic Token Block signalling was introduced by British Rail on the line in 1984.

the capital of the Commewijne District in Suriname. It is a small coastal town situated at the confluence of the Suriname River and Commewijne River, just across from Paramaribo, the country's capital. Its population at the 2012 census was 5,650,Statoids.com with around 1,200 people living in the main town, most of whom are of Javanese and East Indian origin. It is the location of the historical Fort Nieuw-Amsterdam, today an open-air museum. The town of Mari√´nburg with former sugarcane factory is located 3 km from Nieuw Amsterdam and part of the resort. History In 1734, the Society of Suriname decided to build a fort near the confluence of the Commewijne and Suriname River to defend the Colony of Suriname and the capital Paramaribo. On 8 October 1834, Nieuw-Amsterdam became the capital of the newly formed District of Upper Commewijne. Between 1843 and 1854, Nieuw Amsterdam was designated as the location where incoming ships had to quarantine. In 1872, part of the fort was converted to a jail, and would remain the only jail in Suriname until 1967. In 1873 the local population started a program of independent agriculture which was encouraged by governor van Sypesteyn who designated Nieuw Amsterdam and Domburg as suitable locations. On 17 January 1888, a decision was taken to lay the first telephone line between Nieuw- Amsterdam and Paramaribo with branches to redoubts Leiden and Frederiksdorp, and to operate the network from Nieuw-Amsterdam, because it was expected to mainly for military purposes. With the completion of the Jules Wijdenbosch Bridge on 20 May 2000, the East-West Link was further expanded to Commewijne and Marowijne.

Glenn Martin pilot Georgia Ann \\"Tiny\\" Thompson Broadwick (April 8, 1893 in Oxford, North Carolina ‚Äì 1978 in California), or Georgia Broadwick, previously known as Georgia Jacobs, and later known as Georgia Brown, was an American pioneering parachutist and the inventor of the ripcord. She was the first woman to jump from an airplane, the first person to jump from a seaplane, and the first person to jump free-fall (without a static line) with a modern parachute. Biography Born to parents George and Emma Ross on April 8, 1893, Georgia Ann Thompson weighed only 3 pounds. The last of seven daughters, Georgia was given the nickname \\"Tiny\\" due to her small size,Roberson, Elizabeth. Tiny Broadwick: The First Lady of Parachuting. Gretna: Pelican Publishing Company Inc, 2001. p 13 as she weighed only and was tall. At age 12, Tiny Broadwick had married and, at 13, had a daughter, Verla Jacobs (later, Poythress) (1906 - 1985). Tiny Broadwick was an abandoned mother working in a cotton mill, aged 15, when she saw Charles Broadwick's World Famous Aeronauts parachute from a hot air balloon and decided to join the travelling troupe, leaving her daughter in the care of her parents. She later became Broadwick's adopted daughter, to ease travel arrangements, though she has also been referenced as his wife (with her own family later unclear on the relationship). Although she would eventually make her jumps from airplanes, in her early career she jumped from balloons. Broadwick's wife, Maude, had died on November 2, 1905, performing a jump from a balloon. Billed as \\"the doll girl,\\" Tiny Broadwick began performing aerial skydives and stunts while wearing a \\"life preserver,\\" or parachute, designed by her adopted father, making her first jump out of a hot air balloon on December 28, 1908.Call, Helen. \\"Woman - A San Diegan- Was First To Test Parachute For Government.\\" North Island Demonstration, October 29, 1971: D-1, continued on D-4. The skydiving family traveled around and performed at fairs, carnivals, and parks. The appeal of the Broadwick flying troupe, according to Tiny Broadwick, was that \\"it was a very neat and fast act.\\"Tiny Broadwick (Mrs. Georgia Brown) Interview by Kenneth Leish. Transcribed Oral History Interview. May 1960. Made available by Smithsonian National Air and Space Library and Archives Division \\"Tiny\\" with chute Among her many other achievements, she was the first woman to parachute from an airplane, which she is sometimes credited with accomplishing over Los Angeles on June 21, 1913, with aviator Glenn L. Martin as the pilot.Elizabeth Whitley Roberson, Tiny Broadwick: The First Lady of Parachuting (Pelican Publishing, 2001) p48; Thomas C. Parramore, First to Fly: North Carolina & the Beginnings of Aviation (University of North Carolina Press, 2003) p181 However, she previously made at least two jumps from Martin's plane during an exhibition in Chicago's Grant Park the week of September 16, 1912. These early jumps included a well- publicized jump on January 9, 1914, from a plane built and piloted by Martin, 1,000 feet over Griffith Park in Los Angeles. In 1914, she demonstrated parachutes to the U.S. Army, which at the time had a small, hazardous fleet of aircraft. The Army, reluctant at first to adopt the parachute, watched as Tiny Broadwick dropped from the sky. On her fourth demonstration jump, the static line became entangled in the tail assembly of the aircraft, so for her next jump she cut the static line short and did not attach it to the plane. Instead, she deployed her chute manually by pulling the shortened, unattached line while in free-fall in what may have been the first planned free-fall jump from an airplane. This demonstrated that pilots could safely escape aircraft by using what was later called a ripcord. Also in 1914, Broadwick jumped into Lake Michigan, becoming the first woman to parachute into a body of water. In 1912, Tiny Broadwick married Andrew Olsen, divorced, then, in 1916, married Harry Brown, and stopped parachuting for four years. That marriage also ended in divorce; she retained the name Georgia Brown thereafter. She also severed relations with Charles Broadwick, and considered Broadwick to be her stage name. She returned to jumping again in 1920 for two more years, retiring from jumping in 1922 due to problems with her ankles. She was then said to have made over 1,100 jumps. Although she was not a pilot, she was one of the few female members of the Early Birds of Aviation. Tiny Broadwick appeared on You Bet Your Life episode 55‚Äì07 on November 10, 1955,Available on Groucho Marx: You Bet Your Life: The Best Episodes - Disc 2. on To Tell the Truth on March 30, 1964 and on Mysteries at the Museum season 11, episode 33. In 1964, Tiny Broadwick donated a parachute, handmade by Charles Broadwick of 110 yards of silk, to the Smithsonian Air Museum, the precursor to the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum. Broadwick died in 1978 and was buried in Sunset Gardens in Henderson, North Carolina. Legacy In February 2006, Vance County, North Carolina, commissioners decided to name a portion of the Henderson Outer Loop highway after her. Additionally, Broadwick Street in Rancho Dominguez, California, is named for her.

With the Hollies, Clarke achieved international hit singles and is credited as co-writer on several of the band's best known songs including \\"On a Carousel\\", \\"Carrie Anne\\", \\"Jennifer Eccles\\" and \\"Long Cool Woman in a Black Dress\\". He retired from performing in 1999, but returned to the music industry in 2019. Clarke was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2010. Career Harold Allan Clarke and his childhood friend, Graham Nash, began singing together in Manchester while still at school. They formed the Hollies in December 1962 with Vic Steele (lead guitar) and Eric Haydock (bass guitar). In April 1963, they added Tony Hicks (replacing Steele on lead guitar) and Bobby Elliott (replacing Don Rathbone on drums). In 1966, Bernie Calvert replaced Haydock as bass guitarist. Clarke was The Hollies' original lead singer, but also played occasional guitar and harmonica. In the UK, they enjoyed 30 chart singles, plus two further chart entries with re- releases, 17 of which made the Top 10, with two ‚Äì \\"I'm Alive\\" (1965) and \\"He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother\\" (1988 re-issue) ‚Äì reaching No. 1. In the US charts they achieved 23 chart singles, six of which hit the Top 10. Many of the group's songs were co-written by Clarke, usually with Nash and Hicks, until Nash's departure at the end of 1968. They used the pseudonym \\"L. Ransford\\" initially for their song-writing credits, then 'Clarke-Nash-Hicks' from mid-1966 onwards. In 1966, Clarke, along with several Hollies bandmates, assisted in The Everly Brothers recording of their album, Two Yanks in England, which featured Everly cover versions of mostly Hollies songs co- written by Clarke. Clarke-Nash-Hicks composed The Hollies' albums: For Certain Because (1966), Evolution, and Butterfly (both 1967). Their UK hit singles compilation The Hollies' Greatest Hits topped the UK Albums Chart in August 1968. After 1967, Clarke began writing solo songs under the team banner, notably: \\"Lullaby To Tim\\" (dedicated to his son, though sung by Nash), \\"Heading for a Fall\\", \\"Water on the Brain\\", and \\"Would You Believe?\\". Besides the full composing team, Clarke also wrote songs with Nash such as \\"Try It\\", \\"Wishyouawish\\" (1967), \\"Tomorrow When it Comes\\", \\"Jennifer Eccles\\" and \\"Wings\\" (1968). Clarke assumed more of a figurehead profile as front man of the Hollies following Graham Nash's departure from the group in December 1968. Clarke was the sole lead singer on Hollies Sing Dylan (a UK No. 3 album in early 1969). Clarke has sole credit for songs such as \\"My Life Is Over With You\\", \\"Goodbye Tomorrow\\", \\"Not That Way at All\\", \\"Marigold\\" (1969), \\"Mad Professor Blyth\\", \\"Separated\\" (1970), \\"Row the Boat Together\\" and \\"Hold On\\" (1971). Also, Clarke helped Nash's replacement, Terry Sylvester, develop as a songwriter, teaming with him to write a number of songs including \\"Gloria Swansong\\", \\"Look at Life\\" (1969) \\"I Wanna Shout\\", \\"Man Without a Heart\\" and \\"Perfect Lady Housewife\\" (1970).  Departure from and return to the Hollies  Keen to launch a solo career due to Nash's success in Crosby, Stills & Nash, Clarke left the group in 1971. He was replaced by the Swedish singer Mikael Rickfors, who was formerly with Bamboo. Clarke went on to release two solo albums ‚Äì My Real Name Is (Epic, 1972) and Headroom (EMI, 1973). After Clarke left the Hollies, \\"Long Cool Woman in a Black Dress\\", a song from their 1971 album Distant Light, which he had co-written with songwriters Roger Cook and Roger Greenaway, and on which Clarke sang lead and played lead guitar, became an international hit single, reaching No. 2 in the US (their most successful single ever there) and No. 32 in the UK Singles Chart. However, the Hollies toured with Nash's replacement, Sylvester, who assumed the lead vocal on performance of the single instead of Clarke. Rickfors left the group and Clarke rejoined them in July 1973. Their first single with him back in the fold was another of his songs, \\"The Day that Curly Billy Shot Down Crazy Sam McGee\\", a UK top 40 hit that autumn. Clarke continued to record and release solo albums while remaining with The Hollies, although his solo career did not achieve much album or single chart success. He released his self-titled third album in 1974. His next album was I've Got Time (1976). He also performed lead vocals on \\"Breakdown\\" by The Alan Parsons Project, from their 1977 album I Robot. He left The Hollies briefly for the second time in March 1978 and made I Wasn't Born Yesterday (1978), an album of original material mostly written with singer-songwriter Gary Benson. It yielded a US chart hit single in \\"(I Will Be Your) Shadow in the Street\\". He returned to the group in August. Subsequent solo albums included Legendary Heroes (1980), another largely original set, with its UK title and track running order changed to The Only One. He followed with a Best of... compilation (Aura, 1981). His final solo album was Reasons to Believe (1990) issued in Germany on Polydor Records, which remains unreleased in the US and UK. Between 1974 and 1978, Clarke composed most of the original songs the Hollies recorded on a series of studio albums with Tony Hicks and Terry Sylvester. In 1982, Clarke issued a rare non- album single, \\"Someone Else Will\\" c/w \\"Castles in the Wind\\" on Forever Records; however the song failed to chart. Clarke recorded cover versions of Bruce Springsteen's \\"Born to Run\\", \\"Blinded by the Light\\" and \\"If I Were the Priest\\". In this period, Clarke also used material by Lindsey Buckingham, Janis Ian, Gavin Sutherland, and Randy Newman. 1993 saw Clarke's final chart success with the Hollies with the Nik Kershaw penned single, \\"The Woman I Love\\", charting in the UK at No. 42. In 1996, Clarke, with the Hollies and Graham Nash, contributed harmony and support vocals to a new version of \\"Peggy Sue Got Married,\\" featuring lead vocals by Buddy Holly, which was credited as 'Buddy Holly and The Hollies'. It appeared on the Not Fade Away tribute album. Temporary retirement Due in part to ongoing medical problems with his vocal cords, Clarke retired from the music industry in 1999 to care for his wife, who had received a second diagnosis of cancer. Clarke was replaced in the band by Carl Wayne, former lead singer of The Move. Wayne died in 2004. The Hollies continue touring and recording today with Peter Howarth as their vocalist. On 15 March 2010 Clarke, with fellow Hollies members Graham Nash, Tony Hicks, Eric Haydock, Bobby Elliott, Terry Sylvester and Bernie Calvert, was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2011, Clarke made a surprise appearance at a Crosby & Nash concert at the Royal Albert Hall where the two former Hollies performed \\"Bus Stop\\". Having appeared on harmonica for Carla Olson's band The Textones in 2018, Clarke made a return to his solo career in 2019 with a new album, Resurgence, on BMG. Personal life Clarke married Jennifer Bowstead on 24 March 1964 in Coventry. They have three children - Timothy (b. 1966), Toby (b. 1969) and Piper (b. 1972). The Hollies' song title \\"Jennifer Eccles\\" was a combination of the names of Clarke's wife and Graham Nash's then-wife, Rose Eccles.

He is best known for his expedition down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers in the spring and summer of 1796. The French ambassador to the United States, assigned him his mission. French authorities believed some settlers in the region were French sympathizers. France and the United States engaged in an undeclared \\"quasi war\\", at sea, two years later. Collot started his expedition in Philadelphia. He triggered scrutiny, right from the beginning, and was shadowed by Zebulon Pike. Pike arrested Collot, at Fort Massac, Illinois, but had to release him as there was no charges that could be laid against him. Collot traveled through very lightly settled territories. France had ceded Louisiana, and all the Mississippi basin west of the Mississippi itself to Spain. Following the American Revolution the eastern branches of the Mississippi was American territory. He made maps and observed fortifications and the country's military preparedness, almost certainly on a secret mission on behalf of the French Republic. He had been watched during his progress, however, and on arriving in New Orleans he was almost immediately arrested by Carondelet, the Spanish governor, on October 27, and placed in custody at the Balize until he could be sent out of the colony on December 4. Gen. Collot published an account of this expedition under the title \\"Voyage dans l'Am√©rique Septentrionale\\". He also authored a \\"M√©moire sur les moyens de soumettre les rebelles de St. Dominique\\", a proposal for subjugating the rebels of San Domingo. His account of his travels was translated into English and published in 1826. In March 2017 the Kentucky Gateway Museum Center celebrated purchasing two of Collot's maps, maps of Kentucky. When describing the purchase the Kentucky Herald-Leader called Collot \\"an excellent mapmaker but a lousy spy.\\" One of the maps was ‚ÄúThe Course of the Ohio from its Source to its Junction with the Mississippi.‚Äù It was purchased from a private collector. The other map was a map of Kentucky. Most of Collot's other maps were of rivers, or riverports, while the second map purchase was of the overland route between Maysville to Lexington.

History  The station was opened in 1880 by the Dingwall and Skye Railway, but operated from the outset by the Highland Railway. When the D&SR; were forced to cut back the railway during its planning, Attadale was initially chosen as the planned terminus of the shortened line, to allow a suitable location near Loch Carron to build a pier adjacent to the station for steam boats to berth. However, more detailed planning proved this area of the loch quite shallow, which would have meant the large cost of building an extraordinarily long pier. Instead, the line was to terminate further on at Stromeferry, where a deeper section of the loch could be found, meaning the steamers could berth more easily and more closely to the station at a shorter, less expensive pier. Attadale then opened as a request stop ten years after the Dingwall & Skye Railway commenced services. Initially, Attadale station had just a single wooden shelter for passengers, whilst a large red flag was used for signalling the train to stop. Taken into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway during the Grouping of 1923, the line then passed on to the Scottish Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948. When sectorisation was introduced by British Rail, the station became part of ScotRail until the privatisation of British Rail. The station is from , and has a single platform which is long enough for a two-coach train. The platform has a simple but covered brick waiting room.

Wallabout Bay is a small body of water in Upper New York Bay along the northwest shore of the New York City borough of Brooklyn, between the present Williamsburg and Manhattan Bridges. It is located opposite Corlear's Hook in Manhattan, across the East River to the west. Wallabout Bay is now the site of the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The nearby neighborhood of Wallabout, dating back to the 17th century, is adjacent to the bay. The neighborhood is a mixed use area with an array of old wood frame buildings, public housing, brick townhouses, and warehouses; it contains the historic Lefferts-Laidlaw House, which was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. The name of this curved bay on the western end of \\"Lang Eylandt\\" (Long Island) comes from the Dutch \\"Waal bocht\\", which means \\"Walloons' Bend\\", named for its first European settlers: the Walloons, from what is today Wallonia. History The Wallabout was first settled by Europeans when several families of French-speaking Walloons opted to purchase land there in the early 1630s, having arrived in New Netherland in the previous decade from Holland. Settlement of the area began in the mid-1630s when Joris Jansen Rapelje exchanged trade goods with the Canarsee Indians for some of land at Wallabout Bay, but Rapelje, like other early Wallabout settlers, waited at least a decade before relocating full-time to the area, until conflicts with the tribes had been resolved.Ostrander, Stephen M. and Black, Alexander (1894) \\"A History of the City of Brooklyn\\" Brooklyn Eagle Most historical accounts put Rapelje's house as the first house built at Wallabout Bay. His daughter Sarah was the first child born of European parentage in New Netherland, and Rapelje later served as a Brooklyn magistrate as well as a member of the Council of Twelve Men.Wick, Steve \\"14 Generations: New Yorkers Since 1624, the Rapaljes Are On a Mission to Keep Their History Alive\\" Newsday Rapelje's son-in-law Hans Hansen Bergen owned a large tract adjoining Rapelje's.A History of the City of Brooklyn, Stephen M.

Wallabout Bay is the southerly lobe of water outlined in light blue in the upper right hand quadrant of this 1766 map of Brooklyn Starting in 1637, the Wallabout served as the landing site of the first ferry across the East River from lower Manhattan. Cornelis Dircksen, the lone ferryman, farmed plots on both sides‚Äînear to where the Brooklyn Bridge now spans‚Äîto best employ his time on either bank of the river. A feudal system of land tenure was suspended in 1638, and the small settlement became a colony of freeholders: after a ten-year period of paying the Dutch East India Company a tenth of their yield, colonists would own their farmland. (\\"Bruijk\\" means \\"to use\\" and \\"leen\\" means \\"loan\\" in Dutch.) The humble \\"Bruykleen Colonie\\" expanded out from the Wallabout to become the city of Brooklyn. Wallabout Bay was the site of one of the earliest murder trials in Brooklyn's history. On June 5, 1665, Barent Jansen Blom, an immigrant from Sweden and progenitor of the Blom/Bloom family of Brooklyn and the lower Hudson Valley, was stabbed to death by Albert Cornelis Wantenaer, allegedly in self-defense. Wantenaer was tried for murder in the Court of Assize on October 2, 1665. He was convicted of a lesser charge of manslaughter, suffering the punishment of loss of his property and a year's imprisonment.Scandinavian Immigrants in New York, 1630-1645 Part III, Swedish Immigrants in New York, 1630-1634 by John O. Evjen, Ph.D. Published 1916, Minneapolis reprinted by Genealogical Publishing Co., Inc. Baltimore, 1972, reprinted for Clearfield Co., Inc. Baltimore, 1996.pp. 321-322. Accessed May 6, 2014 The area was the site where British prison ships moored during the American Revolutionary War from about 1776‚Äì1783, the most infamous of which was . Around 12,000 prisoners of war were said to have died by 1783, when all the remaining prisoners were freed. Many died due to neglect; some were buried on the eroding shore in shallow graves, or often simply thrown overboard. The Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument in nearby Fort Greene, which houses some of the prisoners' remains, was built to honor these casualties. The bay eventually became the site of the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Parts of the bay were filled in to expand the yard. In the late 19th century, fill created a small island, as depicted in the Taylor Map of New York, and later fill joined it to the mainland. Potter's Field The bay was nicknamed \\"Potter's Field\\" among sailors in the 19th and 20th centuries because so many dead bodies would float into the bay during slack tide. In 1951, writer Joseph Mitchell wrote about it in \\"The Bottom of the Harbor\\" published in The New Yorker: Etymology Gabriel Furman, in his Notes Geographical and Historical, relating to the Town of Brooklyn, in Kings County on Long-Island (1824),Furman, Gabriel. Notes Geographical and Historical, relating to the Town of Brooklyn, in Kings County on Long-Island (1824) traces the name from the Dutch \\"Waal bocht\\" or \\"bay (or bight) of the Walloons\\", referring to the original French-speaking settlers of the local area. Another theory ascribes it to the River Waal, an arm of the Rhine, an important inland waterway in the Netherlands, long referred to as \\"inner harbor\\" which would speak to the geographic position of the bay.

Owned by Pamal Broadcasting, the station services the Capital District, including Albany, Schenectady and Troy. WROW serves as the local affiliate for CBS News Radio, and is the EAS primary entry point for northeastern New York state. The WROW studios are located in the Albany suburb of Latham, while the station transmitter is located in nearby Glenmont. Besides a standard analog transmission, WROW is simulcast over low-power Albany translator W263CG (100.5 FM), and is available online. WROW formerly broadcast in C-QUAM AM stereo, but no longer operates in stereo as of 2017. WROW is historically notable for being the first station owned by Capital Cities Communications, which in 1985 purchased the American Broadcasting Company, becoming one of the largest media companies in existence at the time of that purchase. History Early years On September 30, 1947, WROW first signed on when a startup company, the Hudson Valley Broadcasting Company, acquired the rights to the frequency.Broadcasting Yearbook 1977 page C-138 At the outset, the station had an affiliation with the Mutual Radio Network, switching to ABC in 1950. The relationship with ABC was short lived, with WROW taking WTRY's CBS affiliation later in November 1954, in a deal to get the rights to the CBS television network for its soon- to-debut co-owned TV station, WROW-TV channel 41, (today's ABC-affiliated WTEN on channel 10). In 1957, Hudson Valley Broadcasting became the Capital Cities Television Corporation, as Albany is the capital city of New York State. (In 1960, the name was changed to Capital Cities Broadcasting, to reflect its increasing radio holdings, including WROW.) The CBS Radio affiliation has remained on WROW ever since, and was shared for a time with WKLI-FM, the original home of the Magic format, beginning in 2001. Beautiful music In the late 1950s, WROW decided to flip to a Top 40 format, the first such attempt in the Capital District, which was initially a hit. But Capital Cities's success with the beautiful music format in New York City and other markets led WROW to switch to easy listening around 1963. In October 1966, WROW signed on WROW-FM (95.5) which simulcast the AM station. On January 1, 1967, the Federal Communications Commission stopped allowing AM and FM stations in most cities to simulcast, except for 25% of their programming. To get around this rule, WROW-AM-FM began \\"shadowcasting\\" which allowed the same commercials to run on both stations, although the music on one station had to be delayed for a short time before it could be heard on the other station. (Most listeners were not even aware of this practice.) The combined signals of WROW and WROW-FM were among the most popular and financially successful radio outlets in the Capital District for most of the 1970s and 1980s. Switch to news/talk WMAL. In 1983, Capital Cities sold WROW-AM-FM to Dot Broadcasting, a group of local owners. Soon thereafter, WROW would be sold once again to another local ownership group. The aging demographics of the easy listening format led to a split in programming for WROW-AM-FM in 1991, with WROW-AM keeping the easy listening format. In 1993, the WROW stations were bought by current owner Albany Broadcasting, which soon made changes to both stations. In February 1994, WROW flipped to an all-news format by day with talk programming nights and weekends. Though a good idea on paper, the news format had low ratings and was a high expense format. In 1996, the station flipped to a full-time talk format. A slow starter at first, the arrival in 1997 of former WQBK host and program director Paul Vandenburgh helped improve ratings and made WROW a formidable second talk station next to talk leader WGY. In 2007, WROW began overhauling its programming. Vandenburgh left WROW in October 2007 to become part-owner of WGDJ, a station on WQBK's former frequency. Leaving along with Vandenburgh to go to WGDJ were the Live from the Capitol report with Fred Dicker and a weekly interview show with Albany Mayor Jerry Jennings. Mike and the Mad Dog, which had aired as WROW's afternoon show as a simulcast with WFAN in New York City, was dropped at this time as well. Programming during the talk radio era As a talk station, WROW's local morning show was co-hosted by Steve van Zandt and Jackie Donovan. Syndicated talk shows heard the rest of the day on the station included: The Glenn Beck Program; The Radio Factor with Bill O'Reilly; John Gibson, Dave Ramsey, Alan Colmes and Joey Reynolds. Weekend syndicated programs included Brian and the Judge, Lars Larson, and Bill Cunningham; the first two of which previously aired on weekdays. WROW also held a sports play-by-play contract with the Albany River Rats ice hockey team, and that continued after the format change. Siena College men's basketball was once carried on the station, but moved to WGDJ in 2009. In the past, WROW has aired other daily syndicated shows including Brian and the Judge (and its predecessor hosted by Tony Snow), Laura Ingraham, and a simulcast of the WFAN-based Mike and the Mad Dog. Past local programming has included \\"Afternoon Drive with Sherman Baldwin,\\" \\"Live from the State Capitol,\\" now heard on WGDJ, \\"The Mark Williams Show,\\" and \\"The Scotto Show,\\" hosted by Scott Allen Miller. Becoming Magic 590 WROW discontinued the news/talk format on February 8, 2010, citing the difficulty of competing with WGDJ and WGY. The station then adopted its current format, which was moved from WKLI-FM, and was simulcast on both stations for two weeks, to help listeners adjust to the change. By mid-February, WROW was the exclusive radio home of the \\"Magic\\" format, with WKLI-FM switching to adult hits. In April 2018, with the demise of WINU's sports format, WROW and sister station WKLI-FM became Albany's radio home of the New York Mets baseball and New England Patriots football teams for the 2018 season. The Mets were slated to move to WKLI-FM only in 2019 however this did not come to pass due to network realignments, and the Patriots also left in 2019, leaving the Albany metro area without radio coverage of either team. On January 3, 2019, WROW began simulcasting its format on sister station WENU in South Glens Falls.

Gameplay  Spanky attacks by throwing a small purple bubble. He can then bounce the bubble on his head. Every time he bounces the bubble, the bubble grows and changes color. The bubble can then be popped, depending upon the bubble's size and color, different types of sports balls will fly out of the bubble destroying enemies touched by the balls. For example, a purple bubble will release a baseball and the largest orange bubble will release several basketballs. If an enemy is touched by a bubble, he will simply be stunned and unable to move for a moment. The first time a bubble is thrown, it is purple. If it is popped, a baseball comes out and can only hit one enemy at a time. If a purple bubble is bounced on Spanky's head, it turns green. When the green bubble is popped, it creates a string of soccer balls that can usually take out a line of enemies. Bouncing the green bubble creates a yellow bubble that, when popped, becomes a gyrating volleyball, causing damage to an area of increasing radius. Bouncing the bubble a fourth and last time, the largest bubble is reached. When this orange bubble is popped, it releases several basketballs that shower down on a wide range of enemies. Each further bounce does nothing to the bubble; it remains orange. There are a total of five worlds with ten levels each. After clearing each world's ten levels, the player must face a main boss. After defeating all five bosses, the player fights the witch herself. In the SNES version, levels are cleared when the required number of keys unlocks a door; in the GB version, levels are cleared when all the enemies have been destroyed. The enemies in the game are generally different types of fruits, with the notable exception of the witch.  Plot  The SNES game has a storyline in which Spanky must defeat an evil witch named Morticia.

Upland and lowland are conditional descriptions of a plain based on elevation above sea level. In studies of the ecology of freshwater rivers, habitats are classified as upland or lowland. Definitions Upland and lowland are portions of plain that are conditionally categorized by their elevation above the sea level. Lowlands are usually no higher than , while uplands are somewhere around to . On rare occasions, certain lowlands such as the Caspian Depression lie below sea level. Upland habitats are cold, clear and rocky whose rivers are fast-flowing in mountainous areas; lowland habitats are warm with slow-flowing rivers found in relatively flat lowland areas, with water that is frequently coloured by sediment and organic matter. These classifications overlap with the geological definitions of \\"upland\\" and \\"lowland\\". In geology an \\"upland\\" is generally considered to be land that is at a higher elevation than the alluvial plain or stream terrace, which are considered to be \\"lowlands\\". The term \\"bottomland\\" refers to low-lying alluvial land near a river. Many freshwater fish and invertebrate communities around the world show a pattern of specialisation into upland or lowland river habitats. Classifying rivers and streams as upland or lowland is important in freshwater ecology as the two types of river habitat are very different, and usually support very different populations of fish and invertebrate species. Upland In freshwater ecology, upland rivers and streams are the fast-flowing rivers and streams that drain elevated or mountainous country, often onto broad alluvial plains (where they become lowland rivers). However, altitude is not the sole determinant of whether a river is upland or lowland. Arguably the most important determinants are those of stream power and stream gradient. Rivers with a course that drops rapidly in altitude will have faster water flow and higher stream power or \\"force of water\\". This in turn produces the other characteristics of an upland river‚Äîan incised course, a river bed dominated by bedrock and coarse sediments, a riffle and pool structure and cooler water temperatures. Rivers with a course that drops in altitude very slowly will have slower water flow and lower force. This in turn produces the other characteristics of a lowland river‚Äîa meandering course lacking rapids, a river bed dominated by fine sediments and higher water temperatures. Lowland rivers tend to carry more suspended sediment and organic matter as well, but some lowland rivers have periods of high water clarity in seasonal low-flow periods. The generally clear, cool, fast-flowing waters and bedrock and coarse sediment beds of upland rivers encourage fish species with limited temperature tolerances, high oxygen needs, strong swimming ability and specialised reproductive strategies to prevent eggs or larvae being swept away. These characteristics also encourage invertebrate species with limited temperature tolerances, high oxygen needs and ecologies revolving around coarse sediments and interstices or \\"gaps\\" between those coarse sediments, Lowland Amazon River near Manaus, Brazil, an example of a lowland river habitat. The generally more turbid, warm, slow- flowing waters and fine sediment beds of lowland rivers encourage fish species with broad temperature tolerances and greater tolerances to low oxygen levels, and life history and breeding strategies adapted to these and other traits of lowland rivers. These characteristics also encourage invertebrate species with broad temperature tolerances and greater tolerances to low oxygen levels and ecologies revolving around fine sediments or alternative habitats such as submerged woody debris (\\"snags\\") or submergent macrophytes (\\"water weed\\").

Erikson Childhood and Society (Middlesex 1975) p. 66 He also explored the 'morality demanded by the archaic superego ... an automatized pseudo morality, characterized by Alexander as the corruptibility of the superego'.Fenichel, p. 291 Notable too was his exploration of acting out in real life, 'in which the patient's entire life consists of actions not adapted to reality but rather aimed at relieving unconscious tensions. It was this type of neurosis that was first described by Alexander under the name of neurotic character'.Fenichel, p. 375 Psychosomatic work and short-term psychotherapy Franz Alexander led the movement looking for the dynamic interrelation between mind and body. Sigmund Freud pursued a deep interest in psychosomatic illnesses following his correspondence with Georg Groddeck who was, at the time, researching the possibility of treating physical disorders through psychological processes. Together with Freud and S√°ndor Ferenczi, Alexander developed the concept of autoplastic adaptation. They proposed that when an individual was presented with a stressful situation, he could react in one of two ways: * Autoplastic adaptation: The subject tries to change himself, i.e. the internal environment. * Alloplastic adaptation: The subject tries to change the situation, i.e. the external environment. From the 1930s through the 1950s, numerous analysts were engaged with the question of how to shorten the course of therapy but still achieve therapeutic effectiveness. These included Alexander, Ferenczi, and Wilhelm Reich. Alexander found that the patients who tended to benefit the most greatly from therapy were those who could rapidly engage, could describe a specific therapeutic focus, and could quickly move to an experience of their previously warded-off feelings. These also happened to represent those patients who were the healthiest to begin with and therefore had the least need for the therapy being offered. Clinical research revealed that these patients were able to benefit because they were the least resistant. They were the least resistant because they were the least traumatised and therefore had the smallest burden of repressed emotion. However, among the patients coming to the clinic for various problems, the rapid responders represented only a small minority. What could be offered to those who represented the vast bulk of patients coming for treatment? See further Intensive short-term dynamic psychotherapy. The corrective emotional experience > In the forties ... Franz Alexander, following the lead of Sandor Ferenczi, > proposed ... the form of a \\"corrective emotional experience\\", which enjoyed > an enormous vogue.Janet Malcolm, Psychoanalysis: the impossible profession > (London 1988) p. 102 Alexander stated: The concept provoked much controversy, provoking opposition from figures as disparate as Kurt R. Eissler, Edward Glover, and Jacques Lacan, who later said 'I did not hesitate to attack it myself in the most categorical way ... at the 1950 Congress of Psychiatry, but, it is the construction of a man of great talent'.Jacques Lacan, The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis (London 1994) p. 174 By the sixties, Alexander's conception was in retreat, and at the close of the following decade an analyst could ask rhetorically 'Who talks about Franz Alexander today ‚Äî except those who want to put down his \\"corrective emotional experience\\" or to deny, as the Kohutians are at constant pains to do, that they are offering more of the same?'.Malcolm p. 118 Ongoing developments in object relations theory and the rise of self psychology would however lead to a revival of interest in the idea. It was championed again by Moberly (1985). In the latter's view, corrective emotional experience represents essentially what is therapeutic in analysis'.patrick Casement, Further learning from the Patient (London 1997), p. 91 Even those with continuing reservations about the idea conceded that 'when Alexander was writing ... it was pertinent for him to be drawing attention to the therapeutic value of the emotional experience of patients in analysis'.Casement, p. 91 In the twenty-first century, the term has passed into common psychodynamic parlance. Thus notions of testing the relationship in cognitive therapy are seen as 'not dissimilar to the notion of the \\"corrective emotional experience\\" in psychodynamic therapy'; elucidation in existential therapy as opening up 'new experiences with the therapist, thus providing a corrective interpersonal experience'.Jan Grant and Jim Crawley, Transference and Projection (Buckingham 2002) p. 70 and p. 80 Publications * 1931, The Criminal, the judge and the public: A psychological analysis.

John Flanagan and Martin Sheridan of the Irish American Athletic Club, with fellow Irishman James Mitchell of the New York Athletic Club at the 1904 Olympic Games in St. Louis, Missouri. Martin John Sheridan (March 28, 1881 - March 27, 1918) was \\"one of the greatest athletes the United States has ever known\\"New York Times, March 28, 1918. according to his obituary in the New York Times. He was born in Bohola, County Mayo, Ireland, and died in St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan, New York, the day before his 37th birthday, a very early casualty of the 1918 flu pandemic. He is buried in Calvary Cemetery, Queens, New York. He was part of a group of Irish-American athletes known as the \\"Irish Whales\\". Career At 6 ft 3 in (191 cm) and 194 lbs (88 kg), Sheridan was the best all-around athlete of the Irish American Athletic Club, and like many of his team mates, served with the New York City Police Department (from 1906 until his death in 1918). Sheridan was so well respected in the NYPD, that he served as the Governor's personal bodyguard when the governor was in New York City.Mens Discus Throw at Sports Reference A five- time Olympic gold medalist, with a total of nine Olympic medals, Sheridan was called \\"one of the greatest figures that ever represented this country in international sport, as well as being one of the most popular who ever attained the championship honor.\\" He won the discus throw event at the 1904, 1906, and 1908 Summer Olympics as well as the shot put at the 1906 Olympics and the Greek discus in 1908. At the 1906 Intercalated Games in Athens he also won silver medals in the standing high jump, standing long jump and the stone throw. In 1907, Sheridan won the National Amateur Athletic Union discus championship and the Canadian championship, and in 1908 he won the Metropolitan, National and Canadian championships as well as two gold medals in the discus throw and bronze in the standing long jump at the 1908 Olympic Games.1910 Mecca Cigarettes Champion Athlete and Prize Fighter Series trading card. Two of Martin Sheridan's gold medals from the 1904 Olympic Games in St. Louis, Missouri and one of his medals from the 1906 Olympic Games in Athens, Greece, are currently located in the USA Track & Field's Hall of Fame History Gallery, in Washington Heights, Manhattan. Legacy It is often claimed that Sheridan fueled a controversy in London in 1908, when flagbearer Ralph Rose refused to dip the flag to King Edward VII. Sheridan is supposed to have supported Rose by explaining \\"This flag dips to no earthly king,\\" and it is claimed that his statement exemplified both Irish and American defiance of the British monarchy. However, careful research has shown that this was first reported in 1952. Sheridan himself made no mention of it in his published reports on the Games and neither did his obituary.Mallon & Buchanan, Journal of Olympic History, Sept 1999 The inscription on the granite Celtic Cross monument marking Martin Sheridan's grave in Calvary Cemetery, Queens, New York says in part: \\"Devoted to the Institutions of his Country, and the Ideals and Aspirations of his Race.

Although the church was widely discussed in Anglican circles at the time of its founding, it has not achieved significant growth since that time. In 2019 the church held a celebration of 25 years since its foundation. It holds an annual conference at Benson, Oxfordshire. Since 2008 the church has regularly exhibited at the Christian Resources Exhibition at Esher, Surrey and elsewhere in England. It publishes a magazine called The Journal as well as other literature and books. Origins and doctrine The church was founded on 10 February 1994 at a meeting chaired by David Samuel at St Mary's, Castle Street, Reading, as a reaction against the use of contemporary-language liturgies (particularly the 1980 Alternative Service Book) and the recently approved ordination of women as priests. The church holds to the unmodified Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion of the Church of England (constitution section 1), to the 1662 Book of Common Prayer, which alone is used by its congregations for worship (constitution section 2), and to the historic three- fold ministry of bishops, priests, and deacons, ordained according to the Ordinal of the 1662 Book of Common Prayer (constitution section 3). Its doctrine is Calvinist, and it stands in the conservative evangelical protestant tradition. The church maintains a conservative view on Christian leadership, and women are not permitted to teach at meetings or to exercise authority in the church (constitution section 3). Congregations The Church of England (Continuing) has one church building, St Mary's in Reading, which was the church of its founding member, David Samuel. A second group meets in Wolverhampton, in the former Long Street synagogue (built 1903). Additionally, small groups meet in a retirement housing complex in Colliers Wood, and a community centre in Frinton-on-Sea. These are the only four congregations listed by the church as of 2020: *St Mary's Church, Castle Street, Reading, Berkshire ‚Äì minister, Edward J. Malcolm *St John's Church, Colliers Wood, London, ‚Äì minister, Peter Ratcliff *St Silas' Church, Wolverhampton *Holy Trinity Church, Frinton-on-Sea ‚Äì lay minister, Philip Lievesley A previous fifth congregation, at Nuffield, has since closed. Leadership The church has had three presiding bishops since its foundation: * David Samuel, 1995‚Äì2001 * Edward Malcolm, 2001‚Äì2013 * Edward J Malcolm, 2013‚Äìpresent The first bishop of the church was its founder, David Samuel, who is now retired. He consecrated as his successor Edward Malcolm, minister of St Silas' Wolverhampton, who died on 17 November 2013. The current presiding bishop is Edward J. Malcolm, minister of St Mary's, Reading, who was also consecrated by David Samuel, one week after the death of Edward Malcolm in 2013. The bishop, Edward J Malcolm, is currently one of only two active clergymen in the church, although there are several lay readers and preachers. The church establishes its episcopal succession from the late Albion Knight, Archbishop of the United Episcopal Church of North America, who consecrated David Samuel on 11 June 1995. The closest link of episcopal succession with the Church of England is John Moore (Archbishop of Canterbury), who consecrated William White of Pennsylvania in 1787, and from whom Knight claimed his succession.

Definition In philosophy, infallibilism (sometimes called \\"epistemic infallibilism\\") is the view that knowing the truth of a proposition is incompatible with there being any possibility that the proposition could be false. This is typically understood as indicating that for a belief to count as knowledge, one's evidence or justification must provide one with such strong grounds that the belief must be true, or equivalently, that it is completely impossible for it to be false. The infallibility of such a belief may also mean that it cannot even be doubted. Importantly, infallibilism should not be confused with the universally accepted view that a proposition P must be true in order for someone to know that P. Instead, the infallibilist holds that a person who knows P could not have all of the same evidence (or justification) that one currently has if P were false, and therefore that one's evidence/justification offers a guarantee of the truth of P. Thus, in cases where a person could have held the same true belief P with the same level of evidence (or justification) and still been wrong, the infallibilist holds that the person does not know P. The infallibilist defines knowledge in the following way: A person (henceforth S) knows that a proposition (henceforth P) is true if and only if... # P is true. # S believes that P is true. # S is justified in their belief that P is true. # S's justification guarantees the truth of P. According to the infallibilist, fallible beliefs may be rationally justified, but they do not rise to the level of knowledge unless their truth is absolutely certain given one's evidence. The contrary view to infallibilism, known as fallibilism, is the position that a justified true belief may be considered knowledge even if one's evidence does not guarantee its truth, or even if one can rationally doubt it given one's current evidence. Infallibilism should not be confused with skepticism, which is the view that knowledge is unattainable for rational human beings. While numerous critics of infallibilism claim that defining knowledge according to such high standards collapses into epistemic skepticism, many proponents of infallibilism (although not all) deny that this is the case.  History of infallibilism  Ren√© Descartes, an early proponent of infallibilism argued, ‚Äúmy reason convinces me that I ought not the less carefully to withhold belief from what is not entirely certain and indubitable, than from what is manifestly false‚Äù.  Contemporary infallibilism  Infallibilism is rejected by most contemporary epistemologists, who generally accept that one can have knowledge based on fallible justification. Baron Reed has provided an account of the reasons why infallibilism is so widely regarded as untenable today. Nevertheless, an increasing number of contemporary philosophers have presented arguments in defense infalliblism and have therefore come to reject fallibilism. For instance, Mark Kaplan defends such a view in a 2006 paper entitled \\"If You Know You Can't Be Wrong\\".Mark Kaplan, \\"If you know you can't be wrong,\\" in Other notable contemporary proponents of infallibilism include Andrew Moon, Julien Dutant, and Matthew Benton.See ; ; and .

The field is relatively young, having only come into common usage in the early 1980s, but the basic idea of chemostratigraphy is nearly as old as stratigraphy itself: distinct chemical signatures can be as useful as distinct fossil assemblages or distinct lithographies in establishing stratigraphic relationships between different rock layers. Types of chemical variations In some stratigraphic sequences, there is clearly a variation in color between different strata. Such color differences often originate from variations in the incorporation of transition metal-containing materials during deposition and lithification. Other differences in color can originate from variations in the organic carbon content of the rock. However, until relatively recently, these variations were not commonly investigated because of the great effort and expense involved in chemical analysis. Recently, the development of new analytical techniques for chemical analysis for igneous petrological applications during the latter half of the 20th century, e.g., the electron microprobe, and the development of normal focus X-ray fluorescence for wellsite oil exploration has improved the availability of bulk chemical analysis techniques to the sedimentary geologist, making analysis of the chemical composition of strata increasingly possible. Concurrently, advances in atomic physics stimulated investigations in stable isotope geochemistry. Most relevant to chemostratigraphy in general was the discovery by Harold Urey and Cesare Emiliani in the early 1950s that the oxygen isotope variability in the calcite shells of foraminifera could be used as a proxy for past ocean temperatures. Thus, chemostratigraphy generally provides two useful types of information to the larger geological community. First, chemostratigraphy can be used to investigate environmental change on the local, regional, and global levels by relating variations in rock chemistry to changes in the environment in which the sediment was deposited. An extreme example of this type of investigation might be the discovery of strata rich in iridium near the boundary between the Cretaceous and Tertiary systems globally. The high concentration of iridium, which is generally rare in the Earth's crust, is indicative of a large delivery of extraterrestrial material, presumably from a large asteroid impactor during this time. A more prosaic example of chemostratigraphic reconstruction of past conditions might be the use of the carbon-13/carbon-12 ratio over geologic time as a proxy for changes in carbon cycle processes at different stages of biological evolution. Second, regionally or globally correlatable chemostratigraphic signals can be found in rocks whose formation time is well-constrained by radionuclide dating of the strata themselves or by strata easily correlated with them, such as a volcanic suite that interrupts nearby strata. However, many sedimentary rocks are much harder to date, because they lack minerals with high concentrations of radionuclides and cannot be correlated with nearly datable sequences. Yet many of these rocks do possess chemostratigraphic signals. Therefore, the correlation between chemostatigraphic signals in conventionally datable and non-datable sequences has extended greatly our understanding of the history of tectonically quiescent regions and of biological organisms that lived in such regions. Chemostratigraphy also has acted as a check on other sub-fields of stratigraphy such as biostratigraphy and magnetostratigraphy.

In organic chemistry, it is a molecule or a part of a macromolecular chain containing two positive charges in a conjugated system.  Bipolarons in physics  In physics, a bipolaron is a bound pair of two polarons. An electron in a material may cause a distortion in the underlying lattice. The combination of electron and distortion (which may also be understood as a cloud of phonons) is known as a polaron (in part because the interaction between electron and lattice is via a polarization). When two polarons are close together, they can lower their energy by sharing the same distortions, which leads to an effective attraction between the polarons. If the interaction is sufficiently large, then that attraction leads to a bound bipolaron. For strong attraction, bipolarons may be small. Small bipolarons have integer spin and thus share some of the properties of bosons. If many bipolarons form without coming too close, they might be able to form a Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensate. This has led to a suggestion that bipolarons could be a possible mechanism for high-temperature superconductivity. For example, they can lead to a very direct interpretation of the isotope effect. Recently, bipolarons have been found in a Bose-Einstein condensate. Two polarons interchange sound waves and they attract to each other, forming a bound-state when the strength coupling between the single polarons and the condensate is strong in comparison with the interactions of the host gas.  Bipolarons in organic chemistry  In organic chemistry, a bipolaron is a molecule or part of a macromolecular chain containing two positive charges in a conjugated system. The charges can be located in the centre of the chain or at its termini. Bipolarons and polarons are encountered in doped conducting polymers such as polythiophene.

It is typically known in English as the mauve stinger, but other common names are purple-striped jelly (causing potential confusion with Chrysaora colorata), purple stinger, purple people eater, purple jellyfish, luminous jellyfish and night-light jellyfish. In Latin, pelagia means \\"of the sea\\", nocti stands for night and luca means light; thus, Pelagia noctiluca can be described as a marine organism with the ability to glow in the dark (bioluminescence). It is found worldwide in tropical and warm temperate seas, although it is suspected that records outside the North Atlantic region, which includes the Mediterranean and Gulf of Mexico, represent closely related but currently unrecognized species. A fairly small and variably coloured species, both its tentacles and (unusual among jellyfish) bell are covered in stinging cells. Stinging incidents are common, painful and the symptoms may continue for a considerable time after the encounter, but they are generally not dangerous. When large numbers of this oceanic species are washed ashore, the local economy can be affected because tourists avoid the beaches and fishers are stung while trying to retrieve their nets, which can be clogged by the jellyfish. Additionally, swarms of Pelagia noctiluca have been recorded wiping out entire fish farms. Because of this, it has become one of the most studied jellyfish species. Distribution, habitat and taxonomy Individual near Sydney, Australia, currently included in Pelagia noctiluca, but likely an undescribed species This jellyfish is best known from the North Atlantic region, ranging from 4th parallel north (just north of Equator) to the North Sea and Atlantic Canada, including the Mediterranean and Gulf of Mexico. There are reports from most other tropical or warm temperate seas around the world, including both the Pacific and Indian Oceans, with its apparent southern limit being 42nd parallel south. Some of the locations are California (rare), Hawaii (rare), and all around Australia (common). However, it is suspected that Pelagia noctiluca‚Äîas currently defined‚Äîis a species complex with records outside the North Atlantic region involving other closely related species that presently are unrecognized or undescribed. Even North Atlantic and South Atlantic populations show significant genetic differences. A comprehensive taxonomic review is necessary to resolve the situation. In 2014, a second species in the genus Pelagia was described from the Mediterranean, but two years later it was moved to its own genus as Mawia benovici. The swimming ability of Pelagia noctiluca is limited and as a result large swarms (also known as blooms) of this oceanic species are occasionally carried by the wind or current to inshore areas, sometimes ending up stranded on beaches. This also means that the species sometimes appears in waters outside its normal temperature preference, with records as far north as the Shetland Islands and the Norwegian deep. It generally occurs at water temperatures between , but below it stops pulsating. It mostly ranges from the surface to a depth of , but has been recorded to . Pelagia noctiluca partakes in the diel vertical migration, occurring near the surface at night and deeper during the day. Local populations fluctuate greatly and the species may go virtually unrecorded in a region for years, only to suddenly reappear in huge swarms. On occasion, a swarm may cover tens of square kilometers, include millions of Pelagia noctiluca, and reach densities of more than 500 individuals per m3 (14 per ft3).  Description  Pelagia noctiluca at Elba in the Mediterranean Pelagia noctiluca are fairly small jellyfish with adults having a bell diameter of . Their colour is variable, ranging from mauve, purple, pink, light brown to yellow. The body is radially symmetrical. There is only one body cavity known as the gastrovascular cavity. This is a primitive gut or digestive cavity with only one opening that is used for ingestion and excretion; there are four long oral arms with crenulated margins that are the primary feeding surface. Each P. noctiluca medusa has eight long tentacles that emerge from the umbrella margin. Being radially symmetrical it has no head and thus no centralized nervous system. The nervous system present is primitive, consisting of a simple net composed of naked and largely non-polar neurons. In addition P. noctiluca also lacks a gaseous exchange, excretory and circulatory system. However cnidaria have evolved cnidae, cells which serve for a variety of functions that include prey capture, defense, locomotion and attachment. When fully formed cnidae are called cnidocytes. When stimulated the cnidae secrete nematocyst toxins that are biological poisons. These organisms have a well- developed manubrium, a proboscis-like structure bearing the mouth and four long oral arms. Also the mesoglea, or jelly, is relatively thickened and well developed in this species. Sense organs, known as rhopalia in the scyphomedusae, are located around the umbrella margin in notches and alternate between tentacles. Cnidae are present in the epidermis and gastrodermis of the umbrella, as well as on the tentacles. P. noctiluca has eight marginal tentacles alternating with eight marginal sense organs. Four gonads arise as elongated endodermal proliferations, developing into ribbon-like folds in the interradial sectors of the stomach wall slightly distal to the rows of gastric filaments. Male and female gonads vary only slightly and the main difference is the thickness of the follicle.  Bioluminescence  P. noctiluca are bioluminescent, i.e. have an ability to produce a low light that is visible to humans during the night. Light is emitted in the form of flashes when the medusa is stimulated by turbulence created by waves or by a ship's motion. This flashing is only of relatively short duration and gradually fades. A very early description of bioluminescence was provided by Pliny the Elder in Historia Naturalis (77 AD), using the name \\"pulmo marinus\\", and now considered to refer to P. noctiluca.  Behavior   Life cycle and reproduction  Pelagia noctiluca in the medusa (adult) stage near Sicily in the Mediterranean Sea P. noctiluca is adapted to a pelagic, open-sea mode of life. Whereas most jellyfish, including the other species in the family Pelagiidae, have a life cycle with both the free-swimming stages (planula, ephyra and medusa) and a bottom-living polyp stage, P. noctiluca has adapted in such a way that the polyp stage is absent. P. noctiluca reproduces sexually with the male and female spawning respectively sperm and eggs into the sea during daylight hours. After 3 days, the fertilized egg develops into a planula; at this stage movement is only done by ciliary action. After a week, planulae develop into tiny ephyrae and a month later they develop into (male or female) medusae. There is little or no ephyra growth at temperatures below , and fewer survive below . The bottom-living polyp stage of most other jellyfish species is in between the planula and ephyra stages. Initially, the medusa of P. noctiluca only has a bell diameter of about . Some already reach maturity at in bell diameter and at all are mature. In the Mediterranean Sea, P. noctiluca appear to mostly spawn between the late summer and early winter, but also at lower levels in the spring to early summer. Large swarms of adults at the ocean surface in certain times of the year possibly are spawning aggregations. This jellyfish typically lives for about 9 months.  Feeding  ephyrae of Pelagia noctiluca competing for eggs of the Atlantic bluefin tuna P. noctiluca are opportunistic and have been recorded feeding on a wide range of small organisms like planktonic crustaceans (cladocerans, copepods, ostracods and crustacean larvae), mollusk larvae, larvaceans, hydromedusae, siphonophorans, arrow worms, fish eggs and fish larvae, as well as detritus suspended in the open water and microscopic phytoplankton. The phytoplankton can be consumed either directly or indirectly by eating herbivorous crustaceans with stomachs filled with it. The ability to eat phytoplankton is‚Äîas far as known‚Äîhighly unusual among cnidarians. P. noctiluca will eat small warty comb jellies (Mnemiopsis leidyi), potentially helping to control this invasive species. Cannibalism where adults consume young of their own species is also common in P. noctiluca. Feeding reactions were studied by Bozler (1926), where a piece of food was given to the marginal tentacle, the tentacle contracted quickly. There was a slow contraction of the coronal muscle which brought the tentacle nearer to the mouth. The food was grasped by the lip of one of the oral arm and transported slowly along until it reached the stomach. They were found to feed on the salp Thalia democratica; however, they are found mainly to feed by taking food particle by the amoeboid process of the endoderm cells, thus being suspension feeders.  Sting  Pelagia noctiluca may strand in large numbers, as shown on this beach in Tunisia P. noctiluca is considered the most important stinging jellyfish in the Mediterranean Sea. Both its tentacles and‚Äîunusual among jellyfish‚Äîthe bell are covered in cnidocytes (stinging cells), and even recently dead, stranded individuals can sting. The sting causes pain that typically lasts 1‚Äì2 weeks, local redness, swelling and a rash, but it is generally not dangerous and there are no known fatalities. On occasion, symptoms may be more general and include dizziness, vomiting and diarrhea. Sudden recurrent skin eruptions may occur years later. Rarely, the sting can cause a serious allergic reaction and leave scars or hyperpigmented marks on the skin that can remain for years after the encounter. If stung by P. noctiluca there can be cross-reactivity (an allergic reaction) if later stung by Portuguese man o' war (Physalia physalis) or sea nettles (Chrysaora). There is one known case where a sting by P. noctiluca caused Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© syndrome, but all symptoms disappeared within 6 months. Peculiarly, there is a record of a seven-arm octopus \\"borrowing\\" the stinging capability of a P. noctiluca. The open-sea octopus grabbed and positioned the jellyfish in such a way that it provided a defense.  References  *Russell, F.S. 1970.

The show would round out the hour with a few more sketches, often with the musical guests participating in these. Besides the regular weekly show, The Drifters, or \\"Dorifu\\" as they came to be called, would also have special presentations every few months. These specials would be an hour and a half and would consist of many short sketches. Often they would have special guests, usually famous singing performers, that would participate in the sketches but would not always sing during the show. In the late 1970s, between 1977-1978, The Drifters were often linked to the singing duo Pink Lady through a series of popular fumetti style manga and , a children's show based on Journey to the West. The show featured puppet caricatures of the Drifters as the principal characters while Pink Lady provided narration and the show's theme song, as well as insert songs based on their hit singles. Solo projects After Hachijidayo! ended in 1985, the group virtually disbanded but continued to get together for their occasional hour and a half specials. Shimura Ken teamed up with Cha Kato for the series Katochan Kenchan Gokigen TV (Fun TV with Kato-chan and Ken-chan). Nakamoto Koji became a regular on the TV program Toyamano Kinsan. Takagi Boo recorded a number of albums of Hawaiian style music. After Katochan Kenchan Gokigen TV, Kato Cha became a regular on the program \\"Musashibo Benkei\\" and appeared as a special guest on other TV programs. After Katochan Kenchan Gokigen TV, Shimura Ken also starred in other TV shows such as \\"Shimura Ken no Bakatonosama\\" and \\"Shimuraken no Daijobuda\\" and guest starred on other TV shows.

History Minkakwa, Kewan, and Pamrapo What became Greenville was the territory of the Hackensack and Raritan Indians at the time of European contact in the 17th century. They called the area on Bergen Neck Minkakwa (alternatively spelled Minelque and Minackqua) meaning \\"a place of good crossing\\". This is likely so because it was the most convenient pass between the two bays on either side of the neck. Interpreted as \\"place where the coves meet\\", in this case where they are closest to each, it describes a spot advantageous for portage.http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text- idx?c=moa&cc;=moa&sid;=95e3f6e828e116b80d4cccd93c806bc1&view;=text&rgn;=main&idno;=AFJ8379.0001.001 page 50 The area was first settled by New Netherlanders in 1647. The Caven Point settlement on the west shore of the Upper New York Bay between Pamrapo and Communipaw was part of Pavonia, which, upon receiving its municipal charter in 1661 was renamed Bergen.

There are three isomers of coumaric acid‚Äîo-coumaric acid, m-coumaric acid, and p-coumaric acid‚Äîthat differ by the position of the hydroxy substitution of the phenyl group. p-Coumaric acid is the most abundant isomer of the three in nature. p-Coumaric acid exists in two forms trans-p-coumaric acid and cis-p-coumaric acid. It is a crystalline solid that is slightly soluble in water, but very soluble in ethanol and diethyl ether.  Natural occurrences  p-Coumaric acid can be found in Gnetum cleistostachyum.  In food  p-Coumaric acid can be found in a wide variety of edible plants and fungi such as peanuts, navy beans, tomatoes, carrots, basil and garlic. It is found in wine and vinegar. It is also found in barley grain. p-Coumaric acid from pollen is a constituent of honey.  Derivatives  p-Coumaric acid glucoside can also be found in commercial breads containing flaxseed. Diesters of p-coumaric acid can be found in carnauba wax.  Metabolism   Biosynthesis  It is biosynthesized from cinnamic acid by the action of the P450-dependent enzyme 4-cinnamic acid hydroxylase (C4H). : cinnamic acid \\\\begin{matrix}{}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\xrightarrow\\\\mathrm{C4H}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\{}\\\\end{matrix} para-coumaric acid It is also produced from L-tyrosine by the action of tyrosine ammonia lyase (TAL). : L-Tyrosine \\\\xrightarrow\\\\mathrm{TAL} para-coumaric acid + NH3 \\\\+ H+ Biosynthetic building block  p-Coumaric acid is the precursor of 4-ethylphenol produced by the yeast Brettanomyces in wine. The enzyme cinnamate decarboxylase catalyzes the conversion oof p-coumaric acid into 4-vinylphenol. Vinyl phenol reductase then catalyzes the reduction of 4-vinylphenol to 4-ethylphenol. Coumaric acid is sometimes added to microbiological media, enabling the positive identification of Brettanomyces by smell. :The conversion of p-coumaric acid to 4-ethyphenol by Brettanomyces cis-p-Coumarate glucosyltransferase is an enzyme that uses uridine diphosphate glucose and cis-p-coumarate to produce 4‚Ä≤-O-Œ≤-D-glucosyl-cis-p-coumarate and uridine diphosphate (UDP). This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases, specifically the hexosyltransferases. Phloretic acid, found in the rumen of sheep fed with dried grass, is produced by hydrogenation of the 2-propenoic side chain of p-coumaric acid. The enzyme, resveratrol synthase, also known as stilbene synthase, catalyzes the synthesis of resveratrol ultimately from a tetraketide derived from 4-coumaroyl CoA. p-Coumaric acid is a cofactor of photoactive yellow proteins (PYP), a homologous group of proteins found in many eubacteria.

According to the 1988 film Harlem Globetrotters: Six Decades of Magic,Harlem Globetrotters: Six Decades of Magic (1988) Haynes could dribble the ball as many as 348 times a minute. Early playing days As a child, Haynes learned to dribble a basketball in the dirt yard of his home. A native of Sand Springs, Oklahoma, he attended Booker T. Washington High School and received a $25 church scholarship to play basketball for Langston University, where he attended from 1942 to 1946. During his time with the Langston Lions, the team racked up a winning record of 112‚Äì3, including a 59-game winning streak. In a February 1945 conference tournament game, Haynes showed off his dribbling skills for more than two minutes, running down the clock on a solid lead to ridicule an opponent, Southern University, which had run up the score against an inferior team (Sam Huston College, later Huston-Tillotson University, coached by a young Jackie Robinson) in a previous round.\\"Jackie Robinson, College Basketball Coach .\\" Austin American-Statesman, April 15, 1997. Haynes' own coach, the legendary Zip Gayles, threatened to kick him off the team for his showboating display, but it got an immense response from the crowd at the game. In 1946, Langston was invited to play an exhibition game against the Globetrotters in Oklahoma City. In that game, Haynes led Langston to a 4-point win, catching the eye of team owner Abe Saperstein in the process. He was invited to join the Globetrotters, and, after completing his degree, began his long professional career. Prior to joining the Globetrotters, Haynes briefly played for the Kansas City Stars of the Black Professional Basketball League. Tenure with the Harlem Globetrotters Haynes played with the Globetrotters from 1947 to 1953. One of the exhibition games in which he played was the famous game in West Berlin on August 22, 1951, where a landmark 75,000 people were recorded in attendance‚Äîalthough Haynes later insisted the turnout was closer to 90,000‚Äîand Haynes met track star Jesse Owens, with whom he roomed on the tour. He also toured South America with the Globetrotters and played a series of exhibition games against some of the top college basketball teams in the United States. In 1953, Haynes left the Globetrotters after an acrimonious split with Abe Saperstein, the team's owner. After quitting the team, he turned down a $35,000 a year offer from the Philadelphia Warriors that would have made him the second-highest paid player in the NBA to found his own barnstorming team, the Harlem Magicians, after finding out that Saperstein was a part-owner of the Warriors. He also received an offer to play for the Minneapolis Lakers in 1955, but he turned down that opportunity as well. Despite a series of legal battles with Saperstein, Haynes attended his funeral in 1966, although he later joked he was only there to \\"make sure he didn't jump out of the casket\\". Haynes later rejoined the Globetrotters as a player and coach in 1972. During his second stint with the team, he founded a clothing company in 1973, through which he met his wife Joan, a model. He was a regular on the 1974‚Äì75 The Harlem Globetrotters Popcorn Machine TV show. After leaving the Globetrotters again in 1979, he played for Meadowlark Lemon's Bucketeers, the Harlem Wizards, and a revitalized incarnation of his old Harlem Magicians. By the end of his playing career, Haynes was estimated to have played in at least 12,000 games and visited more than 100 countries. In retirement Haynes retired in 1992 after a 46-year professional career, and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1998, the first Globetrotter to be so honored. On January 5, 2001, he received his \\"Legends\\" ring from the Harlem Globetrotters in Chicago. The Globetrotters also retired his #20 jersey in his honor. Haynes spent his twilight years in Plano, Texas, where he and his wife moved in the mid-1990s to be closer to their daughters. His old team, the Globetrotters, \\"pulled strings\\" to get him a ticket to the 2010 NBA All-Star Game in Arlington, Texas. In 2011, he was inducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame. That year, he also joined the staff of the Texas Legends, a farm team for the Dallas Mavericks. At the time, he told the press that, even at the age of 85, \\"Basketball is constantly on my mind.\\" Death Haynes died at the age of 89 on May 22, 2015, in Plano, Texas.http://www.bostonherald.com/news_opinion/obituaries/2015/05/harlem_globetrotters_great_marques_haynes_dies_at_89 His death was stated to be of natural causes. Legacy Haynes was considered to be among the greatest ballhandlers who ever lived. Wilt Chamberlain once said, \\"What he did was something that I could never do, and I could do almost everything on the basketball court.\\" His game influenced players such as Bob Cousy, Pete Maravich, and Fred \\"Curly\\" Neal. He has been described as one of the best basketball players never to compete in the NBA. Haynes was known for his catchphrase, \\"I'm Marques Haynes, I'll show you how!\\" He was also father- in-law to Dallas Cowboys great Drew Pearson.

This was Germany's first official service medal for soldiers of Imperial Germany who had taken part in the war, and where they had since died it was also awarded to their surviving next-of-kin. Shortly after its issuance, the government of Nazi Germany declared the award as the only official service decoration of the First World War and further forbade the continued wearing of German Free Corps awards on any military or paramilitary uniform of a state or Nazi Party organization. The Honour Cross was awarded in three forms: * 70px - for front-line veterans, with swords * 70px - for non-combatant veterans, without swords * 70px - for surviving widows and parents of fallen participants in the war, without swords.For the next of kin (widows and parents), of those who died in battle or as a result of wounds received in battle or having died in captivity or missing in action. The Honour Cross was modelled on the reverse side of the War Commemorative Medal of 1870/71 (Preu√üen Kriegsdenkm√ºnze 1870-1871), and was designed by Eugene Godet.German WWI Hindenburg Crosses The medal awarded to combatants (the Frontk√§mpferkreuz) displayed a laurel wreath encircling a medallion, with the dates \\"1914 1918\\". Crossed swords are between the arms. The reverse side was plain, except for the manufacturer's logo. The Honour Cross for non-combatants has no swords and a wreath of oak leaves. Both crosses are in bronze. The Honour Cross for Next- of-Kin (commonly known as the Widows Cross), was finished in black. The Honour Cross was worn suspended from a ribbon with black edge stripes, two white stripes, two black stripes and a red stripe in the middle between them. The ribbon for the Honour Cross for Next-of-Kin had these colours in a different order, having a white edge stripes, with two black stripes, white stripes on either side of a red stripe in the middle. They were frequently worn with the ribbon fashioned into a bow, with a pin on the back, which the mother or widow in question attached to her clothing. The application for this award had a time limit, which expired at the end of 1942. Each award came with an Urkunde, or certificate, which indicated which form the award took. The certificates for the next-of-kin crosses came in two types: those for widows were titled Ehrenkreuz f√ºr Witwen (Honour Cross for Widows), those for parents Ehrenkreuz f√ºr Eltern (Honour Cross for Parents). The award was ranked above other service and occupation medals, but below other awarded combat medals. The number of awards given was: *for combatants 6,202,883 *for non-combatants 1,120,449 *for widows 345,132 *for parents 372,950 *total 8,041,414 By a decree dated 30 November 1938, the State Minister of the Interior introduced these awards into the Ostmark (the name of Austria after it was annexed by Nazi Germany). By 1940, it had also been approved for persons of German heritage from seized lands of the Sudetenland, Czechoslovakia, Danzig, Saar and Memel. Awarding of the cross to war participants of German heritage continued after the deadline for applications had closed within the previous boundaries of Germany. Such Honour Crosses were still being awarded as late as 1944. For all attached military personnel outside these regions, the F√ºhrer, through the ordinance of 30 June 1942, had already ordered approval of these awards.

His nickname was . Life and career 1931‚Äì1962: Childhood and early career Ch≈çsuke Ikariya was born with the name on November 1, 1931 in Tokyo, Japan. During the war his family moved from their home in Sumida, Tokyo to the countryside in Shizuoka. There he took up a job as a factory worker as a young man. He also took up playing the double bass, a hint at his performer nature. He got rather good, too, performing in brass bands until he got a regular job with the \\"Jimmie Tokita & His Mountain Playboys.\\" It was a band that specialised in playing at G.I. bases at the time and had guitarist Takeshi Terauchi. However, during that time in his life he was one of the tallest members of the band, so he stood out. The audience often singled him out for never smiling, picking on him for amusement. 1962‚Äì1969: The Drifters In 1962, Ikariya joined The Drifters, an aspiring pop band that featured comedy routines in its performances of rock and roll music. Members joined and quit the band over the next two years until Ikariya, still persisting, became the leader of the five-member group. The band was able to scrape by though appearing on television afterwards, with Ikariya writing most of the material for the performances. In 1966, The Drifters opened for The Beatles at the Nippon Budokan Hall in Tokyo, although apparently Ikariya didn't see it as much of an accomplishment as opposed to just another job. 1969‚Äì1985: Hachiji dayo, Zenin Shugo In 1969, a producer from TBS offered Ikariya and his Drifters a regular spot on a weekly show. Ikariya, once again, was skeptical, having learned a lot the hard way. But this program went on to become one of the most popular shows of its time, Hachiji dayo, Zenin Shugo!. Its low-brow humour and slapstick comedy made it popular for children, much to the dismay of parents at the time. After the show was over in 1985, Ikariya virtually left the Drifters and all members went on to pursue their own goals. 1985‚Äì2004: Acting career It was then that Ikariya's manager suggested he try acting. Ikariya had very little faith in himself. Ikariya, however, had won the public's adoration by then and played a variety of fatherly roles on television and in movies. His small part in the drama Odoru Dais≈çsasen, which later went on to inspire two movies, though, led him to what was the peak in his career - an Academy Award. When Ikariya won a Japan Academy Award in 1999 for the film Odoru Dais≈çsasen / Bayside Shakedown he claimed that he felt guilty for it. He had apparently never taken his role in the police drama seriously. Death Ch≈çsuke Ikariya died on March 20, 2004 at the age of 72 of cancer of the lymph nodes. He announced his illness in June of the previous year, and left the hospital once in July afterwards for the opening of the movie Bayside Shakedown 2. Awards and nominations *In 1999, Ch≈çsuke Ikariya won the Japanese Academy Awards of Best Supporting Actor for his performance of Heihachiro Waku in the movie Bayside Shakedown.

Oakley, known for his work in the relative dating of fossils by fluorine content, was instrumental in the exposure of the Piltdown Man hoax in the 1950s. Oakley was born and died in Amersham, Buckinghamshire.  Education  Dr. Oakley's early education took place at the Grammar School at Amersham. As a young man he attended University College School, Hampstead, and then University College School, London. The latter is where he earned both his BSc as a major in anthropology and geology, and his PhD in the same field upon his completion of the program in 1938 when he was 27 years old.  Career  Publications Kenneth Oakley authored and contributed to several publications that developed the field of human evolution over the course of his life. One of these publications is the novel Man the Tool-Maker in which he thoroughly outlines the discoveries of pre- hominin and hominin tool use. Oakley does so by walking the reader through the historical background of about the previous conceptions of evolution, why tool use may have started, various tool compositions and purposes as discovered through fossils, and how tool use may have influenced the development of unique cultures. Oakley also includes several illustrations ranging from diagrams of how tools may have been used and actual images of fossilized tools as they have changed over time. Man the Tool-Maker has been republished several times since its initial publication in 1949 for a total of six separate editions by 1976. Another source that Dr. Oakley contributed to is the Catalogue of Fossil Hominids Part III: Americas, Asia, Australasia which he, Bernard Grant Campbell, and Theya Ivitsky Molleson all edited. This catalog, including Part I: Africa and Part II: Europe, organized all the identifying information of the hominids that had been discovered until that time in the late 1960s and early 1970s, including where they were discovered, the key features of the specimen, and their archeological contexts. Dr. Oakley was tasked with providing confirmation of the geological and absolute ages of the specimens, being that that was considered his speciality. = Other Publications Contributed to by Dr. Oakley = *Piltdown man, Bobbs-Merrill, 1955 *The succession of life through geological time, British Museum, 1967 *Frameworks for dating fossil man, Weidenfeld & Nicolson; 3rd ed, 1969 *Catalogue of Fossil Hominids: Africa, British Museum, 1977 *Relative dating of the fossil hominids of Europe, British Museum, 1980  Exposure of Piltdown Man Hoax  In November 1953 Dr. Oakley, along with Drs. J. S. Weiner and W. E. le Gros Clark published The Solution of the Piltdown Problem in the Bulletin of The British Museum of Natural History: Geology Department. This publication provided the discovered evidence that proved the \\"Piltdown Man\\", a skull that was initially deemed a new species and potential \\"missing link\\" called Eoanthropus dawsoni that had been discovered in 1913 by archeologist Charles Dawson, was in fact a hoax. Through a complete re- analysis of the specimen's teeth abrasion, fluorine content, nitrogen content, and coloring, Dr. Oakley and his colleagues concluded that the skull fragments were not of one specimen. Instead, it appeared that the skull was a fabrication produced out of a modern ape mandible that had been skillfully fused to the cranial fragments of another species. This discovery by Dr. Oakley and his colleagues resulted in a vital reconstruction of the existing fossil record such that Eoanthropus dawsoni was removed, and proper research for other evidence of human evolution in other parts of the world could be encouraged.

It is also the Basque name for witches or pagan priestesses (though they could also be male), it being difficult to distinguish between the mythological and real ones. Sometimes sorginak are confused with lamiak (similar to nymphs). Along with them, and specially with Jentilak, sorginak are said often to have built the local megaliths. Sorginak, like other European witches, used to participate in the sabbat, called akelarre locally. These mysteries happened on Friday nights, when Mari and Sugaar are said to meet in the locally sacred cave to engender storms.  Etymology  The etymology of the name is disputed. The common suffix -gin (actor, from egin: to do) is the only agreement. *One theory claims that sor derives from sorte (fortune), and hence it would be rendered as fortune-teller. *The other states that sor is the radical of sor(tu) (to create), and hence sorgin means literally: creator.  Most common references to sorginak  Sorginak are often said to recite the following spell to travel to and back from the akelarre: Under the clouds and over the brambles, or variants of it. In many legends a failed witch (normally a man) says the spell inverted (Under the brambles and over the clouds) and arrives to the akelarre quite bruised. Sorginak also chant the following: :Ez geala, ba geala, :Hamalau mila hemen geala We aren't, we are indeed, Fourteen thousand here we are Other variants of this song are also known. Sorginak often are said to transform themselves into animals, most commonly cats. These cats are sometimes said to bother pious women that do not wish to go the akelarre. It has also been recorded that they collected monetary fines from the people that did not wish to go to their ecstatic gatherings or those witches that absented themselves from them. Inquisitorial documents describe horrific practices of witches, like eating children or poisonings. But popular legends do not speak of these practices, instead mentioning kissing \\"the devil's arse\\" or an animal's genitals, occasional poisoning of crops, bothering modest women (in the shape of cats or other animals) and anointing their bodies with flying ointment (containing entheogenic, Solanaceous plants) to \\"fly\\" to and from the akelarre and perform other supposed feats.  Major persecutions against Basque witches  While in the late Middle Ages there are a handful of references to witchery, they are mostly fines for accusing someone of being one. This changes in the 16th and 17th centuries with the establishment of the Spanish Inquisition and the pan-European witch panic that plagued the Early Modern Age. Since being conquered by Castile in 1512‚Äì21, Navarre (and to a lesser extent areas of the Basque Country) suffered numerous inquisitorial processes, mainly against Jews and Muslims, but occasionally also against Basque sorginak. Particularly important was the 1610 process of Logro√±o that focused on the akelarre of Zugarramurdi. The previous year, in 1609, French judge Pierre de Lancre had initiated a massive process in Labourd, focusing mainly on Basque women and priests. He was eventually displaced but not without causing many deaths and much suffering. The witch panic extended beyond the frontier and accusations of witchcraft proliferated among the local population until the Spanish Inquisition intervened. The Logro√±o process ended with 12 women burnt at the stake (five of them symbolically, as they had died under the tortures inflicted in the process) and shattered Pyrennean Navarre and led also to a serious reconsideration of the Inquisition's attitude towards accusations of witchcraft. The Spanish and Italian Inquisition generally approached accusations of sorcery and witchcraft with skepticism and similar processes were rare in comparison to other European countries where no such centralised institution existed.  Places associated with sorginak  Throughout the Basque Country there are many places associated with sorginak, often also associated with Mari or other mythological characters. This is an incomplete list of the most famous ones: √Ålava *Aramaio: the places of Abadelaueta, Anbotondo and Amezola, as well as an undetermined field at the Gorbea mountain are said to have been places of akelarres. *Maeztu: a woman from this village, Margarita Jauri, was one of the \\"witches\\" tried by the Inquisition in the case of the Zugarramurdi covenant. Though finally acquitted, she was so traumatised by the detention and torture that she committed suicide soon after her release. *Urizaharra: the field of Urkiza or Urkizo seems to have been the site of the local akelarre. Biscay *Anboto peak is the well established principal home of Mari, also known as Anbotoko Sorgina (Witch of Anboto) and Anbotoko Damie (Lady of Anboto). Her home was said to be specifically in an unreachable cave known as Sorginkoba (witch's cave). *Dima: the farmhouse of Petralanda was the main site of the akelarre of Arratia Valley in the 16th century, according to inquisitional records. *Durango was the center of a medieval Beguine heresy that ended with 13 people burnt at the stake. Later, in the 16th and 17th centuries other inquisitional trials were held in this town. *Ma√±aria: the cave of Azkondo was the witches' meeting place, according to local legend. Jos√© Miguel Barandiaran also mentions that the cliffs between the field of Akelarre and the cave of Silibranka (a paleolithic site) were the playfield of demons. *Murueta: the place of Etxebartxuko-landa, according to local legend. *Muxika: several places attributed as akelarre-sites are called generically eperlanda (partridges' field). *Orozko: local legend points to Garaigorta mountain as site of the local akelarre Also the cave of Supelegor, in the karstic area of Itxina, is associated with witches and especially lamiak, and it is even considered one of the mansions of Mari herself. *Zalla: it is called \\"town of sorcerers\\" *Zeberio: the local witches went to the akelarre of Petralanda (in Dima) but also met locally at Hereinoza household. Gipuzkoa *Andoain: an old bridge is said to have been built by witches. *Ataun: the sites of Txabaltxo (near a creek), Iraubeltz (a wood), Mendabiita (a bridge), Zelaun (a plain), a creek near the Artzate farmhouse, the spring of Negarregi and the place of Dantzaleku are all said to have frequented by sorginak. Additionally several local sites bear their name: Sorginiturri (witches' spring), Sorginpelota (witches' ball game), Sorginzulo and Sorgizuloeta (witches' niche and niches respectively). *Azkoitia: the farmhouse of Kimutxo. *Bergara: Itxu mountain was the local site of akelarres. *Errenteria: a woman from this village (now an industrial town), Mar√≠a Zozoaia, was one of the main accused in the process of Zugarramurdi. According to inquisitional records, they gathered in the field of Matxarena, that they called Atsegin Soro (pleasure orchard). *Hernani: the cave of Sorgintxulo, as recorded by Barandiaran. *Hondarribia: a local (but none-the-less brutal) series of inquisitorial trials in 1530 discovered that witches met at Jaizkibel mountain, near the hermitage of St. Barbara. Other sites that the accused declared to be their meeting places were: near the hermitage of St. Philip and St. James, or near the hermitage and castle of St. Telmo. Local popular legend instead says that the akelarres happened near one of the local bridges: either Mendelo, Puntal or Santa Engracia, during the feast of St. Agatha. *Lezo: Inquisitor Ugarte was supposedly poisoned by the local witches in this village in 1531. *Lizartza: near a fence at Aini mountain. *Mendaro: the house of Silerokua or Silerene once was inhabited by a witch that, typically, transformed herself as cat to bother more chaste women, legend says. *Oiartzun: witches met near the cliffs of Irantzi and Puilegi, according to legend. *O√±ati: the cave of Gaiztozulo (evil hole) is said to be one of the main homes of Mari and her court of sorginak. *Pasaia: local woman Mari Zuloko was imprisoned in St. Sebastian, accused of witchery. Later she was stoned and expelled from her hometown, settling in Donibane-Lohitzune. *Tolosa: it is said that witches used to wash clothes near Ugartebide. They also met in Edar Iturri and Sorginerreka. *Zegama here goddess Mari, also often considered a witch, is known as Aketigiko Sorgina (witch of Aketegi mountain). It is also believed that she lives in Sorginzulo cave. Labourd Lapurdi was particularly shaken by the large-scale trials of 1609 led by Pierre de Lancre, who was convinced that most people in the country were witches. *Arcangues: the people of this village had the fame of all being witches. *Ascain: in the 1609 trials, the priest of this village was burnt at the stake as a witch. *Saint-Jean-de-Luz: Alakoandia field and the bridges that are between this village and Ciboure. *Hendaye: the local beach was the favorite site for the akelarre, specifically in a site then known as Lakua (the lake). In the 1609 trials it was declared by one of the accused that there was as many people in the local akelarre as stars are in the sky. *Lahonce: the apparently many witches of this village met in Sohouta (Soule). *Sare: several legends place witches as living in the houses of Egoainea, Ihartzegaraia and Larraburua. The local akelarre was sometimes celebrated at the Fikozelai field. Many local witches were tried in 1609, including several minors and the lady of Txantokorena household. *Saint-P√©e-sur-Nivelle: Pierre de Lancre lived here during the witch-hunt of 1609, in the castle of Amou, whose lord had asked for the trials to be initiated. According to the judicial records, the local akelarre took place either in the cemetery, in private houses or even in the castle of Amou itself, while the trial was active. What this means, if the record is true, is that it was done in the sight of de Lancre himself, which is very unlikely. Other unlikely akelarre-sites mentioned in the process are the hotel Barbarenena, on the very night when de Lancre was sleeping there, and in the home of maistre Segura, de Lancre's criminal advisor. Many local presumed witches were accused of plotting to kill de Lancre. *Urrugne: two local witches were executed by de Lancre here. Others managed to flee to Lower Navarre. *Ustaritz: in 1576 Marie Txorropike of the Ianetabarta household was burnt at the stake. Forty other supposed witches were also executed. Several people, including minors, were also processed here in 1609. The akelarre was celebrated at a site called Pagola. *Ciboure: a large number of people from this town were processed in 1609, including five priests. Navarre Large portions of Navarre were severely affected by an inquisitorial process in 1610, focused in the akelarre of Zurgarramurdi. *Abaurregaina: there's a local natural bridge named Sorginzubi (witches' bridge). *Altsasu: local legend states that Mari lives in the cave of Odabe, having by main servant a sorgina. *Araitz: the local witches met at Urrizola slope before flying to the akelarre. *Arantza: the cliff of Arrutxipi is said to have been the living place of sorginak in the past. *Areso: the cave of Uli, at Ulizar mountain, was the favorite site for the akelarre. *Auritz: the sites of Basajaunberro (probably modern Patxaranberro), near Ortzanzurieta mountain and Sorginarizaga, near Roncesvalles. Two witch-hunts affected this municipality: in 1525‚Äì27 and in 1575. *Bargota: Local priest Juanis de Bargota was also a famous witch. He had special relationship with a female witch of Biana, Endregoto (Lady Goto in Basque). Both were processed by the Inquisition in 1610 but, while Endregoto was burned at the stake, Juanis de Bargota avoided punishment by showing extreme repentance. *Baztan: Abbot Aranibar of Urdazubi made many people confess guilty of witchery by means of torture in 1610, including many children. In 1612 a civil process was initiated against 7 local women. The tortures inflicted in the towers of Jauregizar and Jauregizuri were so brutal that the accused women claimed insistently to be moved to Logro√±o, to be judged by the Inquisition itself, as a lesser evil. It seems that the site of Dutxuketa (in Elbetea) might have been a meeting place for the witches. There is also a dolmen called Sorginetxe (witch's home). *Bera: the local witches met apparently on Larrun mountain, along with their colleagues of Sara and Azkaine. *Bertizarana: according to the inquisitorial records, witches met at Nabarte village. In 1611, also impelled by Abbot Aranibar, there was a witch-hunt in Legasa. Graciana de Maribertizena and her daughter were tortured brutally and confessed to all asked. *Biana: a hill near the Las Ca√±as lagoon was apparently the site of the local akelarres, to which people came also from Logro√±o. Biana was also the hometown of Endregoto, the partner of famous male witch Juanis de Bargota, burnt at the stake in 1610. *Burgi: according to an inquisitorial process of 1569, witches met in Larraionoa and Los Linares, as well as on a barrage at the river. *Ergoiena: Arleze cave is said to have been used by witches. Putxerri cave (also Putterri or Bueitarri), in the Aralar range is said to be inhabited by genii that show themselves as animals, now red, now black, now white; another legend says it is a mansion of Mari and her sorginak, called in the area Putxerriko Damea (Lady of Putxerri). *Esparza: Inquisitor Avellaneda tells how he tried to dismiss the incipient belief in witchery contacted local witches here and was initiated by anointing their magic oil on all them. He then believed to have seen his partners to have done unbelievable feats. After that experience he retook his inquisitorial duties with even greater dedication. The processes that shattered the Salazar valley in 1532 and 1539 record a place called Soto de Tarragona, impossible to locate, as site of the local akelarre. Sometimes the hermit of St. Tirso has been named as place of sabbats as well. *Etxalar was also affected by the 1610 process. In the process, the field of Aranduriaretxa (also Urristilde or Sarueta) and the site of Larbure, were named as akelarre locations. *Garaioa: in 1525, local Martin Lizuain was burnt at the stake in Auritz. In 1577, accused by a 5-year-old boy, seven women were processed and acquitted. Two of them died during the tortures. *Hiriberri: the mountain of Petxuberro (also Petiriberro) is said to have been the site of the akelarre of the Aezkoa Valley. *Izaba: a possible akelarre is said to have taken place in Berin-pikua. *Ituren: the local akelarre apparently used to take place on the heights of Mendaur mountain, near the summit. The processes of 1525 and 1610 affected this village. *Itza: the peak of Oskia or Arkaitz is said to be meeting place for witches here. *Larraun: in Alli cave a nearby, where the dolmen of Akelar is located. Also in the field of Urrizolaegia. *Lerga: the site of Campoluengo. *Lesaka: in the process of 1610 was said that the local akelarre took place in the field of Kolunba. *Miranda de Arga: field of Baiona. *Otxagabia: Legend says that Joan I of Navarre was killed by the black magic of the Bishop of Troyes (who was effectively accused of witchery in 1308‚Äì13); since then this queen's ghost dwells in the Irati forest, seeking revenge. The local akelarre apparently took place in the main plaza of the village, though sometimes took place in Aboddibidea, deep in the mountains. *Pamplona: the capital of Navarre was affected by the trial of 1527. *Piedramillera: near Dos Hermanas twin peaks. *Erronkari: Bedagin-pikoa was the site of the local akelarre. The valley was affected by the persecution of 1532. *Ultzama: the mountains of Aldaun, Xuxurro, Urbilaga and Elizamendia have been said to be sabbatic sites. *Urdazubi: In the 1609 witch-hunt of Labourd, several accused declared to have celebrated the sabbat inside the church of this village. According to Barandiaran, all neighbours of Alkerdi, where there is an important Paleolithic cave-site, as considered to be witches. *Ziordi: Bekatu-Larre (field of sins) was apparently the site of local akelarres. This village was affected by inquisitorial processes in 1575‚Äì76 and 1610. *Zugarramurdi: Akelarrenlezea (cave of the akelarre) is just 500 meters away from the village. Actually witches met in the field of Berroskoberro outside the caves. This village was the focus of the largest and more infamous inquisitorial process, that took place in 1610 in Logro√±o. Seven people were burnt at the stake and other five were burnt symbolically, along with their remains (they had died during the process). A local legend says that all women of Azkar are witches. Lower Navarre *Bidarray: Ebrain bridge, known also as Infenuko zubia (Hell's bridge) is said to have been built by lamiak or sorginak in a single night. *Saint-Michel: the people of this village have been traditionally considered witches as a whole. In other time they were nicknamed akelartarrak (akelarreans). *Iholdy: the local witches apparently washed clothes at Oxarti creek. Soule *Al√ßay- Al√ßab√©h√©ty-Sunharette: Arlegiko Kutxia (Arlegi's cross) is a place that was said that witches made appearances. Another site of akelarres is Artegaina. Near this place there's a cave named Ertzagainako karbia, where legend says a dragon once dwelt. *Ch√©raute: the witches of this village and that of Lahuntza met a some field near Maul√©on.

ORM is the oversight of operational risk, including the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes and systems; human factors; or external events. Unlike other type of risks (market risk, credit risk, etc.) operational risk had rarely been considered strategically significant by senior management.  Four principles  The U.S. Department of Defense summarizes the principles of ORM as follows: * Accept risk when benefits outweigh the cost. * Accept no unnecessary risk. * Anticipate and manage risk by planning. * Make risk decisions in the right time at the right level.  Three levels  ; In Depth: In depth risk management is used before a project is implemented, when there is plenty of time to plan and prepare. Examples of in depth methods include training, drafting instructions and requirements, and acquiring personal protective equipment. ; Deliberate: Deliberate risk management is used at routine periods through the implementation of a project or process. Examples include quality assurance, on-the-job training, safety briefs, performance reviews, and safety checks. ; Time Critical: Time critical risk management is used during operational exercises or execution of tasks. It is defined as the effective use of all available resources by individuals, crews, and teams to safely and effectively accomplish the mission or task using risk management concepts when time and resources are limited. Examples of tools used includes execution check-lists and change management. This requires a high degree of situational awareness.  Process  The International Organization for Standardization defines the risk management process in a four-step model: # Establish context # Risk assessment #* Risk identification #* Risk analysis #* Risk evaluation # Risk treatment # Monitor and review This process is cyclic as any changes to the situation (such as operating environment or needs of the unit) requires re-evaluation per step one.  Deliberate  Link between deliberate and time critical ORM process The U.S. Department of Defense summarizes the deliberate level of ORM process in a five-step model: # Identify hazards # Assess hazards # Make risk decisions # Implement controls # Supervise (and watch for changes)  Time critical  The U.S. Navy summarizes the time- critical risk management process in a four-step model: ; 1. Assess the situation.: The three conditions of the Assess step are task loading, additive conditions, and human factors. * Task loading refers to the negative effect of increased tasking on performance of the tasks. * Additive factors refers to having a situational awareness of the cumulative effect of variables (conditions, etc.). * Human factors refers to the limitations of the ability of the human body and mind to adapt to the work environment (e.g. stress, fatigue, impairment, lapses of attention, confusion, and willful violations of regulations). ; 2. Balance your resources.: This refers to balancing resources in three different ways: * Balancing resources and options available. This means evaluating and leveraging all the informational, labor, equipment, and material resources available. * Balancing Resources verses hazards. This means estimating how well prepared you are to safely accomplish a task and making a judgement call. * Balancing individual verses team effort. This means observing individual risk warning signs. It also means observing how well the team is communicating, knows the roles that each member is supposed to play, and the stress level and participation level of each team member. ; 3. Communicate risks and intentions.: * Communicate hazards and intentions. * Communicate to the right people. * Use the right communication style. Asking questions is a technique to opening the lines of communication. A direct and forceful style of communication gets a specific result from a specific situation. ; 4. Do and debrief. (Take action and monitor for change.): This is accomplished in three different phases: * Mission Completion is a point where the exercise can be evaluated and reviewed in full. * Execute and Gauge Risk involves managing change and risk while an exercise is in progress. * Future Performance Improvements refers to preparing a \\"lessons learned\\" for the next team that plans or executes a task. Benefits # Reduction of operational loss. # Lower compliance/auditing costs. # Early detection of unlawful activities. # Reduced exposure to future risks. Chief Operational Risk Officer The role of the Chief Operational Risk Officer (CORO) continues to evolve and gain importance. In addition to being responsible for setting up a robust Operational Risk Management function at companies, the role also plays an important part in increasing awareness of the benefits of sound operational risk management. Most complex financial institutions have a Chief Operational Risk Officer. The position is also required for Banks that fall into the Basel II Advanced Measurement Approach \\"mandatory\\" category. Software The impact of the Enron failure and the implementation of the Sarbanes‚ÄìOxley Act has caused several software development companies to create enterprise-wide software packages to manage risk. These software systems allow the financial audit to be executed at lower cost. Forrester Research has identified 115 Governance, Risk and Compliance vendors that cover operational risk management projects.

He has had a genre-crossing career, performing with Bruce Springsteen, Uncle Tupelo, Los Super Seven, The Chieftains and James McMurtry in addition to his early work with The Clash and more recent acoustic tours with Lyle Lovett, John Hiatt, and Guy Clark. Biography Early life and career Ely spent his formative years from age 12 in Lubbock, Texas, and attended Monterey High School. In 1970, with fellow Lubbock musicians Jimmie Dale Gilmore and Butch Hancock, he formed the Flatlanders. According to Ely, \\"Jimmie [Gilmore] was like a well of country music. He knew everything about it. And Butch was from the folk world. I was kinda the rock & roll guy, and we almost had a triad. We hit it off and started playing a lot together. That opened up a whole new world I had never known existed.\\" In 1972, the band recorded their first album. Since the band's initial breakup just after their first album was cut, the three musicians have followed individual paths, but have appeared together on each other's albums. They reformed for 2002's Now Again. Solo career Ely's own first, self-titled album, was released in 1977. The following year, his band played London, where he met punk rock group the Clash. Impressed with each other's performances, the two bands later toured together, including appearances in Ely's hometown of Lubbock, as well as Laredo and Ciudad Ju√°rez in Mexico, across the border from El Paso, Texas. The Clash paid tribute to Joe Ely by including the lyrics \\"Well there ain't no better blend than Joe Ely and his Texas Men\\" in the lyrics of their song \\"If Music Could Talk,\\" which was released in 1980 on the album Sandinista. Ely sang backing vocals on the Clash single \\"Should I Stay or Should I Go?\\". Joe Strummer planned to record with Ely's band, but died before that ever happened‚Äîone of Ely's greatest regrets. Another collaboration was with Dutch flamenco guitarist Teye, with whom he recorded Letter to Laredo (1995) and Twistin' in the Wind (1998). Throughout his career, Ely has issued a steady stream of albums, most on the MCA label, and a live album roughly every ten years. On May 1, 1982 Joe Ely put on the Third Annual Tornado Jam in Lubbock, Texas to a crowd of 25,000. The Jam included Leon Russell, Joan Jett and The Crickets. The first Tornado Jam was fundraiser to help Lubbock, Texas after the Tornado, thus the name. The second Annual Tornado Jam had a crowd of 35,000.[Billboard May 1, 1982, page 30 In the late 1990s, Ely was asked to write songs for the soundtrack of Robert Redford's movie The Horse Whisperer, which led to re-forming The Flatlanders with Gilmore and Hancock. A new album from the trio followed in 2002, with a third in 2004. In February 2007, Ely released Happy Songs From Rattlesnake Gulch on his own label, Rack 'Em Records. Ely said in an interview with Country Standard Time that he thought it would be easier to release the material on his own label instead of dealing with a regular record label and their release cycles. A book of Ely's writings, Bonfire of Roadmaps, was published in early 2007 by the University of Texas Press. In early 2008, Ely released a new live album featuring Joel Guzman on accordion recorded at the Cactus Cafe in Austin, Texas late 2006. The Flatlanders released their newest album Hills and Valleys on March 31, 2009. In 2011, Ely released the critically acclaimed album, Satisfied At Last. In September 2015, Ely released Panhandle Rambler, an album with a reflective west Texas feel. Lonestar Music Magazine says ‚Äúthe title fits the record just right, neatly framing a dozen songs that fit together thematically like a map of both the West Texas landscape and of Ely‚Äôs epic decades-spanning musical ramble. Ely spent 2016 as the reigning \\"Texas State Musician\\", a one-year designation which he formally accepted in a ceremony at the State Legislature that spring. On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Joe Ely among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire. Lawsuit against Universal Music Group On February 5, 2019, Ely and John Waite filed a class-action lawsuit against Universal Music Group (UMG) claiming the company is violating their right to terminate grants of copyright after 35 years in accordance with copyright law of the United States by ignoring Notices of Termination. May 3, 2019, UMG filed a motion to dismiss the case, stating the Notices of Termination were not valid because the songs were not grants of copyright but works for hire.

Octets in classical music Octets in classical music are one of the largest groupings of chamber music. Although eight-part scoring was fairly common for serenades and divertimenti in the 18th century, the word \\"octet\\" only first appeared at the beginning of the 19th century, as the title of a composition by Prince Louis Ferdinand of Prussia, whose Octet Op. 12 (published posthumously in 1808) features the piano, together with clarinet, 2 horns, 2 violins, and 2 cellos. Later octets with piano were written by Ferdinand Ries (Op. 128, 1818, with clarinet, horn, bassoon, violin, viola, cello, and double bass), Anton Rubinstein (Op. 9, 1856, with flute, clarinet, horn, violin, viola, cello, and double bass), and Paul Juon (Chamber Symphony, Op. 27, 1907) . Octets tend to be scored in one of the following arrangements: * String octet ‚Äì This arrangement is made up entirely of strings. Felix Mendelssohn's Octet Op. 20 is an example, as are the octets of George Enescu, Dmitri Shostakovich, Niels Gade, Carl Schuberth, Johan Svendsen, Carl Gr√§dener, Joachim Raff, Woldemar Bargiel, Hermann Graedener, Reinhold Gli√®re, Ferdinand Thieriot, Max Bruch, and Airat Ichmouratov. ** Double quartet ‚Äì Double quartets are made up of two string quartets, often arranged antiphonally. Louis Spohr composed four such octets between 1823 and 1847 (opp. 65, 77, 87 and 136), taking as a model a work by Andreas Romberg. Later examples in this mode include works by Nikolay Afanasyev (Housewarming and Le souvenir) and Mario Peragallo (Music for Double Quartet, 1948), as well as Darius Milhaud's paired 14th and 15th String Quartets Op. 291 (1948‚Äì49), which are composed to be playable simultaneously as an octet . ** Cello octet ‚Äì Eight cellos, a combination popularized by Heitor Villa-Lobos in his Bachianas Brasileiras nos. 1 (1930) and 5 (1938/1945), though technically these are for \\"cello orchestra\\" with a minimum of eight players. Villa-Lobos also arranged three of the preludes and four fugues from Johann Sebastian Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier for this ensemble. Several all-cello groups came into existence during the late 1970s and 1980s, notably the Yale Cellos, the 12 Cellists of the Berlin Philharmonic, and the Conjunto Ib√©rico cello octet, and their popularity caused a surge of interest in cello-ensemble writing among composers. Some of the most prominent to compose cello octets include Luciano Berio (Kor√≥t, 1998), Sylvano Bussotti (Po√®sies √† Maldoror, 1999), Edison Denisov (Hymne, 1995), Morton Gould (Cellos, 1984), Sofia Gubaidulina (Fata morgana: die tanzende Sonne, 2002), Gordon Jacob (Cello Octet, 1981), Arvo P√§rt (version of Fratres, (1983), Steve Reich (Cello Counterpoint, 2003), Kaija Saariaho (Neiges, 1998), and Peter Sculthorpe (Chorale, 1994). * Wind octet ‚Äì Usually scored for 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 horns, and 2 bassoons; Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Ludwig van Beethoven composed for this scoring, also known as Harmonie , though only Beethoven actually titled his one work for this grouping \\"Octet\\". The octets of Franz Lachner (Op. 156), Theodore Gouvy (Op. 71) and Carl Reinecke (Op. 216) are scored for flute, oboe, 2 clarinets, 2 horns and 2 bassoons. Igor Stravinsky's Octet for wind instruments has an unusual scoring of flute, clarinet, two bassoons, two trumpets, and two trombones. George Antheil's Concerto for Chamber Orchestra is scored for an octet of flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, contrabassoon, horn, trumpet and trombone. * Wind and string octet ‚Äì a combination of forces, popularized by Franz Schubert (whose Octet is for clarinet, bassoon, horn, 2 violins, viola, cello, and double bass). A number of ensembles have been formed with this instrumentation, including the Octuor de Paris, for whom Iannis Xenakis composed Anaktoria (1969). By contrast, the Octet by Louis Spohr is scored for clarinet, 2 horns, violin, 2 violas, cello, and double bass. Paul Hindemith wrote a less well- known piece for clarinet, bassoon, horn, violin, two violas, cello and double bass. Another important 20th-century octet for winds and strings is Octandre by Edgard Var√®se (1923), for flute (doubling piccolo), oboe, clarinet (doubling E clarinet), bassoon, horn, trumpet, trombone, and double bass . Alec Wilder composed a series of crossover octets between 1938 and 1940 which are scored for a quintet of woodwinds (flute, oboe, clarinet, bass clarinet, bassoon) backed by a rhythm section of harpsichord, double bass and drums. Octets in jazz The Aman jazz octet Jazz ensembles of eight players will frequently be termed an octet. These ensembles may be for any combination of instruments, but the most common line-up is trumpet, alto sax, tenor sax, trombone, guitar, piano, bass and drums, with guitar occasionally making way for another horn, for example baritone sax. The Jamil Sheriff Octet is an example of a classic octet. Ornette Coleman's ensemble for the Free Jazz album (referred to as a double quartet) is an example of two quartets playing together at the same time.

The term was developed by German philosopher-sociologist J√ºrgen Habermas in his work The Theory of Communicative Action.  Structures  Communicative action for Habermas is possible given human capacity for rationality. Habermas situates rationality as a capacity inherent within language, especially in the form of argumentation. \\"We use the term argumentation for that type of speech in which participants thematize contested validity claims and attempt to vindicate or criticize them through argumentation.\\"J√ºrgen Habermas, Theory of Communicative Action, trans. Thomas McCarthy, Boston: Beacon Press, 1984. The structures of argumentative speech, which Habermas identifies as the absence of coercive force, the mutual search for understanding, and the compelling power of the better argument, form the key features from which intersubjective rationality can make communication possible. Action undertaken by participants through a process of such argumentative communication can be assessed as to their rationality to the extent which they fulfill those criteria. Communicative rationality is distinct from instrumental, normative, and dramaturgical rationality by its ability to concern all three \\"worlds\\" as he terms them, following Karl Popper‚Äîthe subjective, objective, and intersubjective or social. Communicative rationality is self-reflexive and open to a dialogue in which participants in an argument can learn from others and from themselves by reflecting upon their premises and thematizing aspects of their cultural background knowledge to question suppositions that typically go without question. Communicative action is action based upon this deliberative process, where two or more individuals interact and coordinate their action based upon agreed interpretations of the situation. Communicative action is distinguished by Habermas from other forms of action, such as instrumental action, which is pure goal-oriented behavior, dealt with primarily in economics, by taking all functions of language into consideration. That is, communicative action has the ability to reflect upon language used to express propositional truth, normative value, or subjective self-expression. Social implications Much of Habermas' work has been in response to his predecessors in the Frankfurt School. Communicative rationality, for instance, can be seen as a response to the critique of enlightenment reason expressed in Max Horkheimer and T.W. Adorno's Dialectic of Enlightenment. Horkheimer and Adorno had argued that the Enlightenment saw a particular kind of rationality enshrined as dominant in western culture, instrumental reason, which had only made possible the more effective and ruthless manipulation of nature and human beings themselves.Adorno and Horkheimer, Dialectic of Enlightenment, trans. Edmund Jephcott, Palo Alto: Stanford UP, 2002 Habermas' form of critical theory is designed to rediscover through the analysis of positive potentials for human rationality in the medium of language, the possibility of a critical form of reason that can lead to reflection and examination of not only objective questions, but also those of social norms, human values, and even aesthetic expression of subjectivity. Habermas' earlier work, The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere, anticipates his concern for argumentation and can be read retrospectively as a historical case study of Western European societies institutionalizing aspects of communicative action in the political and social spheres. Habermas notes the rise of institutions of public debate in late seventeenth and eighteenth century Britain and France especially. In these nations, information exchange and communication methods pioneered by capitalist merchants became adapted to novel purposes and were employed as an outlet for the public use of reason. The notion of communicative rationality in the public sphere is therefore heavily indebted to Immanuel Kant's formulation of the public use of reason in What is Enlightenment? Habermas argues that the bourgeoisie who participated in this incipient public sphere universalized those aspects of their class that enabled them to present the public sphere as inclusive‚Äîhe even goes so far as to say that a public sphere that operates upon principles of exclusivity is not a public sphere at all.J√ºrgen Habermas, The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere, trans. Thomas McCarthy, Cambridge MA: MIT Pres, 1991 The focus on foundations of democracy established in this work carried over to his later examination in The Theory of Communicative Action that greater democratization and the reduction to barriers to participation in public discourse (some of which he identified in the first public sphere of the Enlightenment) could open the door to a more open form of social action. The shift from a more Marxist focus on the economic bases of discourse in Structural Transformation to a more \\"super-structural\\" emphasis on language and communication in Theory of Communicative Action signals Habermas' transition to a post-Marxist framework. Critiques Habermas views communication and debate in the public sphere as argumentatively meritocratic. Critics have argued that Habermas' notion of communicative rationality, upon which communicative action must be based, is illusory. The formal prerequisites of equality among argument participants, for instance, may mask the reality of unequal social capital. \\"There is no guarantee that a formally symmetrical distribution of opportunities to select and employ speech acts will result in anything more than an expression of the status quo.\\"Peter Miller, Domination and Power, Routledge, 1987 Historian Ian McNeeley, for instance, contrasts Habermas' view with Michel Foucault's notion of communication as embodying pre-existing power relationships: \\"J√ºrgen Habermas subscribes to an unrealistic ideal of power-free communication‚Ä¶Michel Foucault remedies this idealism by treating knowledge as power; his work is in fact suffused with applications of knowledge for the control of human bodies.\\"Ian McNeeley, The Emancipation of Writing, Berkeley: Univ. of California Press, 2003 In a like manner, the discursive fiction of consensus achieved through rational argumentation might be used as a legitimating prop for social action to the detriment of marginalized members-this is the basis of much feminist critique of Habermas' notions. Another radical critique is that of Nikolas Kompridis, a former student of Habermas, who views Habermas' theory as another attempt to arrive at a \\"view from nowhere\\", this time by locating rationality in procedures of reaching agreement independent of any particular participants' perspective or background. In response, he proposes a \\"possibility-disclosing\\" role of reason to correct the problems with Habermas' work.Nikolas Kompridis, Critique and Disclosure: Critical Theory between Past and Future (Cambridge: MIT Press, 2006).

History Science Digest was first published in January 1937 in an 8 x 5 inch digest size format of about 100 pages. First edited by G.W. Stamm., it was targeted at persons with a high school education level. It contained short articles about general science often excerpted from other publications in the style of Reader's Digest. The headquarters of Science Digest was in Des Moines, Iowa. In November 1980 the magazine was expanded to an 11 x 8 inch glossy page format with full-length articles and color pictures targeted at a college-educated reader. The new version was largely the creation of its then editor Scott DeGarmo. It was issued bi-monthly with circulation of about 500,000 copies. At first it tended to favor breathless cover lines, and often turned to pseudoscience topics, including spontaneous human combustion and UFOs. Unable to compete with more serious publications, such as Discover and Omni, the magazine ceased publication in 1986. The magazine briefly re-appeared as a quarterly in 1987; returning to the original small \\"digest\\" format, with many short articles and snippets of science information. This final relaunch lasted only one year. Omega Science Digest An Australian edition under the title Omega Science Digest began in January 1981 and had a circulation of 40,000.

A stripper well or marginal well is an oil or gas well that is nearing the end of its economically useful life. In the United States a \\"stripper\\" gas well is defined by the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission as one that produces or less of gas per day at its maximum flow rate; the Internal Revenue Service, for tax purposes, uses a threshold of per day. Oil wells are generally classified as stripper wells when they produce 10-15 barrels per day or less for any twelve-month period. Economical importance In the United States in 2015, 11% of crude oil produced comes from a marginal oil well, and over 85 percent of the total number of U.S. oil wells are now classified as such. There are over 420,000 of these wells in the United States, and together they produce nearly of oil per day, 18 percent of U.S. production. Additionally, as of 2006, there are more than 296,000 natural gas stripper wells in the lower 48 states. Together they account for over of natural gas, or about 9 percent of the natural gas produced in the lower 48 states. Stripper wells are more common in older oil and gas producing regions, most notably in Appalachia, Texas and Oklahoma. A stripper well may cost between $10 to $30 per barrel to operate, averaging $2,000 per month. Taxation In Oklahoma, the regular tax rate is 7%, but may be 1% for marginal wells. In Michigan, stripper well tax is 4%. Other tax exemptions can be 15% of gross income.The Tax Magazine Deloitte, 6 September 2016 A 2005 tax credit for prices below $30/barrel was rarely in effect. Premature abandonment Many of these wells are marginally economic and at risk of being prematurely abandoned. When world oil prices were in the low tens in the late 1990s, the oil that flowed from marginal wells often cost more to produce than the price it brought on the market. From 1994 to 2006, approximately 177,000 marginal wells were plugged and abandoned, representing a number equal to 42 percent of all operating wells in 2006, costing the U.S. more than $3.8 billion in lost oil revenue at the EIA 2004 average world oil price. When marginal wells are prematurely abandoned, significant quantities of oil remain behind. In most instances, the remaining reserves are not easily accessible when oil prices subsequently rise again: when marginal fields are abandoned, the surface infrastructure ‚Äì the pumps, piping, storage vessels, and other processing equipment ‚Äì is removed and the lease forfeited. Since much of this equipment was probably installed over many years, replacing it over a short period should oil prices jump upward is cost prohibitive. Oil prices would have to rise beyond their historic highs and remain at elevated levels for many years before there would be sufficient economic justification to bring many marginal fields back into production.

It is the first book in the Avatar Chronicles trilogy and was published in 2004 by The O'Brien Press Ltd.  Plot summary  Epic takes place on a world named New Earth and follows the life of a boy named Erik Haraldson and his involvement in a game called Epic. Epic is a virtual game which echoes World of Warcraft and EverQuest, although interaction with this game directly affects income, social standing, and the careers of the people who play. Because of this relationship a growing separation of power occurs that mimics the real world, where those with money and power tend to keep it, and those without tend to stay impoverished (both in-game and in real life). In order to build up acclaim in the game, and thus in real life, poor players must work in-game for their entire lives in hopes of becoming powerful enough to take part in challenges set forth by the elite for prizes. With these prizes the citizens may live more comfortably in real life. If a community wishes to redress a perceived injustice, they may challenge Central Allocations or C. A., which is a powerful, select group of nine individuals that controls all of the world's resources and funds the most powerful characters in the game world. All of the members of C. A. are wealthy and possess nearly unbeatable characters in the game. These are the individuals who set challenges which are held in special arenas where various players may attack each other - the last player alive is proclaimed the winner. If you win against the Central Allocations team, then you get what you want, be it a new law, a medical procedure, or a material object. However, if you lose then everything your character owns (including items and money) is forfeited and that person must create a new in-game character. Since death in the game results in death of the character, challenges are a risky method of gaining prosperity, as the characters involved are usually trained for months to years of real life time. The story opens with Erik determined to obtain revenge for the unjust treatment of his parents. Unknown to Erik, his father, Harald, was exiled because he hit another person (Ragnok, a future member of Central Allocations). Ragnok was trying to assault Harald's wife. Having escaped from exile, Harald had hidden in a small out-of-the-way community with his wife, where they had Erik. In order to help his local friends, Harald challenges Central Allocations hoping to remain unknown to them, but his character is identified and he is exiled once more. Before these events, Erik had become fed up with the game, squandering many lives of his avatars in fighting Inry'aat, the Red Dragon, who guards a massive treasure hoard. Most of these attempts are spent trying to figure out a quick way to defeat the dragon. As an expression of his discontent with the world, Erik had gone against convention in making a human female avatar, which he named Cindella and had deliberately chosen an almost unknown character class, swashbuckler. He put all of his ability points into beauty, which most players consider a waste, as beauty has no benefit in battle. This, incidentally, is the cause for the bland, gray characters that predominate in Epic. But curiously, the tale takes a twist and Erik inherits much wealth from his investment in beauty as the game itself begins to respond to his unique avatar. As a result and freed by the plight of his parents from having to play the game in the usual, risk-avoiding grind, Erik dares to dream he can kill the red dragon and with its wealth, challenge the power of C. A. With his friends' help and the use of a strategy he figured out from studying Inry'aat, the red dragon is indeed slain, and as a result Erik and his friends become some of the richest and most famous characters in all of Epic. Each of the group gains about four million bezants, which amounts to more wealth than they could earn in over one hundred thousand years of normal play. This victory propels the teenagers into a series of unexpected encounters including with an evil vampyre (who can kill people in real life from inside the game); the Executioner of C. A.(can kill people in-game); a sinister Dark Elf, and the Avatar of the game itself. The Avatar and the vampyre play a central role in the plot, as they are the opposing sides of the persona that the game itself inexplicably developed. The Avatar represents the game's desire to end its existence and save the people of New Earth, while the vampyre reflects its desire to simply continue existing. They balance each other out in the final conflict of the book, leaving Erik to revolutionise his world by ending the game of Epic.

Early years Eliza Kellas was born on October 4, 1864 near Moores Forks in Franklin County, New York. She attended school in Mooers and Malone and began teaching at Malone in 1880 at the age of 16. In 1887 Kellas began studies at Potsdam Normal School (now known as State University of New York at Potsdam) in Potsdam, New York. She graduated two years later and joined the faculty to teach in the Preparatory Department. Kellas left Potsdam in 1891 to accept a position as Principal of the School of Practice at Plattsburgh Normal School (now known as State University of New York at Plattsburgh) in Plattsburgh, New York. In 1895 she was named Preceptress (equivalent to Dean of Students). In the late 1890s Kellas studied briefly at University of Michigan and Sorbonne in Paris. Kellas resigned from Plattsburgh after 10 years to become a governess to fellow a fellow pioneer in women's education in America, Mary Lyon. Kellas and Lyon traveled widely together between 1901 and 1905, when she entered Radcliffe College in Cambridge, Massachusetts. She graduated from Radcliffe in 1910. Years in Troy In February 1911 Eliza Kellas took the position of headmistress at Emma Willard School in Troy, New York, at the recommendation of Agnes Irwin, the recently retired Dean of Radcliffe College. Emma Willard had just moved to a new campus, the gift of Margaret Olivia Sage. The school's standards and reputation had veered from its founder's original vision and Kellas was charged with restoring those high standards of scholarship and deportment. Kellas worked tirelessly toward these goals, stressing science education for women. She also raised enough alumnae funds to construct several new buildings on campus. Within a few years she helped make the Emma Willard one of the leading institutions of its kind in the country. Under the leadership of Eliza Kellas, Emma Willard School expanded by reactivating the old campus in September 1916. The expansion was named Russell Sage College of Practical Arts, and was devoted to vocational training for young women. While remaining Principal at Emma Willard, Kellas became the first Dean of Russel Sage, as well as serving as the first President of the college. The year following Russell Sage's founding, Kellas secured a separate charter for the school from the New York State Board of Regents and they granted their first degrees in 1920. Through Kellas' efforts, Russell Sage became an independently chartered educational institution in 1927. Kellas retired as Dean and President of Russell Sage College in 1928 and devoted her services entirely to Emma Willard School. She retired from Emma Willard School in 1942. Eliza Kellas died in 1943 in Troy and is buried in Oakwood Cemetery. Honors * Kellas Hall on the campus of Emma Willard School was named in honor of Eliza Kellas. Completed in 1927, it was the second student residence on campus. * Kellas Hall on the campus of SUNY Potsdam was named in honor of Eliza Kellas. It is home to the school's physics department, since Kellas stressed science in women's education. * Kellas Hall on the campus of Russell Sage College was named in honor of Eliza Kellas.

The species is endemic to southwestern Europe. Common names Additional common names for T. lepidus include eyed lizard, and jeweled lacerta (in the pet trade), Description Timon lepidus is one of the largest members of its family. The adult is in total length (including tail) and may reach up to , weighing more than . About two-thirds of its length is tail. Newly hatched young are long, excluding tail. This is a robust lizard with a serrated collar. The male has a characteristic broad head. It has thick, strong legs, with long, curved claws. The dorsal background colour is usually green, but sometimes grey or brownish, especially on the head and tail. This is overlaid with black stippling that may form a bold pattern of interconnected rosettes. The underside is yellowish or greenish with both the male and female sporting bright blue spots along the flanks, though the male is typically brighter in colour than the female. Young are green, grey, or brown, with yellowish or white, often black-edged, spots all over. Male and female ocellated lizard, Timon lepidus, courting. Geographic range Timon lepidus is native to southwestern Europe. It is found throughout the Iberian peninsula (Spain, Portugal), and is patchily distributed in southern France and extreme northwestern Italy. The range for each subspecies is: *Timon lepidus ibericus - northwestern Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal) *Timon lepidus lepidus *Timon lepidus oteroi Ecology Timon lepidus is found in various wild and cultivated habitats from sea level up to in southern Spain. It is rare at higher altitudes. It prefers dry, bushy areas, such as open woodland and scrub, old olive groves and vineyards, and is sometimes found on more open, rocky or sandy areas. It can occasionally be seen basking on roadsides. The lizard usually stays on the ground, but climbs well on rocks and in trees. It can dig holes and sometimes uses abandoned rabbit burrows. Diet Timon lepidus feeds mainly on large insects, especially beetles, and also robs birds‚Äô nests and occasionally takes reptiles, frogs, and small mammals. It also eats fruit and other plant matter, especially in dry areas. Reproduction Breeding in T. lepidus occurs in late spring or early summer. Males are territorial in spring and fight in the breeding season. The female lays up to 22 eggs in June and July about three months after mating, hiding them under stones and logs or in leaf litter or in loose damp soil. It tends to lay fewer, larger eggs in dry areas. The eggs hatch in eight to 14 weeks. The lizard is sexually mature at two years of age. Conservation Timon lepidus was listed as near threatened on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. the species has been under protection in Spain; capture and trade is forbidden.Real Decreto 139/2011, de 4 de febrero, para el desarrollo del Listado de Especies Silvestres en R√©gimen de Protecci√≥n Especial y del Cat√°logo Espa√±ol de Especies Amenazadas.

He was one of the four publishers of the Encyclop√©die of Diderot and d'Alembert, along with Michel-Antoine David, Laurent Durand, and Antoine- Claude Briasson. Le Breton contributed some articles to the Encyclop√©die (see External links, below), but acted primarily as publisher and editor, often against Diderot's will. In 1745, le Breton set out to publish a translation of Ephraim Chambers' Cyclopaedia of 1728. He initially chose Jean Paul de Gua de Malves as his editor, but he tired of the job after two years, and in 1747, the editorship went to Diderot. For a more detailed account, see Encyclop√©die. With the assistance of his foreman Louis-Claude Brull√©, Le Breton would occasionally censor articles in order to make them less radical, frequently drawing the ire of Diderot. For example, le Breton did not included a portion of Diderot's article \\"Menance\\" that indirectly attacked Joly de Fleury, the French police commissioner.Frankel, Charles. \\"The Censoring of Diderot's Encyclopedie and the Re-Established Text by Douglas H. Gordon, Norman L. Torrey\\". The Journal of Philosophy. 44: 721‚Äì723 ‚Äì via Jstor. Le Breton also censored Diderot by changing certain words to distort the meaning of the article.Frankel, Charles. \\"The Censoring of Diderot's Encyclopedie and the Re- Established Text by Douglas H. Gordon, Norman L. Torrey\\". The Journal of Philosophy. 44: 721‚Äì723 ‚Äì via Jstor.

Gordon, Norman L. Torrey\\". The Journal of Philosophy. 44: 721‚Äì723 ‚Äì via Jstor. According to Friedrich Melchior Grimm, writing in 1777, \\"The entire extent of the injury done by this unexampled, murderous, and infamous depredation will never be known, since the perpetrators of the crime burned the manuscript as soon as it was printed and left the evil without remedy.\\" This claim has proved not to be true for, unknown to Grimm, le Breton had kept copies of the page proofs. This collection of final proofs totaled 318 pages. The collection of proofs is known as the \\"18th volume\\" of the Enclyop√©die.Gordon, Douglas (1947). The censoring of Diderot's \\"Encyclop√©die\\" and the re-established text. New York City: Columbia University Press. In the 20th century, these proofs were used to reveal the extent of le Breton's censorship, which was most prominent in the articles \\"Sarrasins ou Arabes\\" and \\"Pyrrhoniene philosophie.\\" In addition, le Breton excluded three of Diderot's articles titled, \\"Sectes du Christianisme\\" and \\"Tol√©rance\\" as well as the subarticle \\"Th√©ologie Scholastique\\".Morissey, Robert. \\"ARTFL Enclyop√©die\\". University of Chicago. In the latter case, le Breton edited Diderot's original article to be less favorable towards Pierre Bayle, a 17th-century philosopher whose views were deemed unacceptable. Bayle's views were deemed unacceptable because he was critical of the Church and its use of violence.

Platform 1 on the up (southbound) line can accommodate trains having ten coaches, but platform 2 on the down (northbound) line can only hold five.  History  Opened on 1 October 1864 as Bonar Bridge by the Inverness and Aberdeen Junction Railway and designed by Joseph Mitchell, it became the meeting point of the Sutherland Railway and the Inverness and Ross-shire Railway. The station joined the Highland Railway, later becoming part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway during the Grouping of 1923; it then passed on to the Scottish Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948. It was renamed Ardgay on 2 May 1977. When sectorisation was introduced by British Rail in the 1980s, the station was served by ScotRail until the privatisation of British Rail. Today Ardgay is the termination point for some commuter services from . The southbound platform is twice the length of the northbound platform.

Founded 1998 by Lorenz Seidler, it provides a weekly newsletter \\"eSeL Mehl\\", various mailing lists, a photo- archive and an event-database. The label \\"eSeL\\" is also serving as a nickname for the artist Lorenz Seidler (originating in the phonetic pronunciation of his initials), who also is initiating, curating and conducting various art projects. eSeL's offices are located at Museumsquartier in Vienna. About eSeL The label eSeL (also serving as a nickname of founder Lorenz Seidler) represents the crossover of the roles of artist, curator, online medium and infrastructure-provider in contemporary artistic practice in the new media genres. \\"Esel\\" means \\"donkey\\" in German. The label originates in the phonetic pronunciation of its founder's initials and soon became a standalone brand, expanding its animal analogies into a multitude of animals-participants. Qualities attributed to the eponymous animal are consciously matching with the initiative's characteristics: stubbornness (autonomy and independence), grey fur (searching for options beyond the polarity of right/wrong or good/bad), long ears (overhearing insider's information), asininity (asking alleged ‚Äústupid‚Äù questions). eSeL aims at revealing and changing conventions and coherence in the art field, putting a special focus on structural implications and representation in the media sphere. \\"Kunst kommt von Kommunizieren\\" (\\"art derives from communication\\") is eSeL's slogan - Contributions of the term \\"art\\" are shown as a constant process of (transitory) quality agreements. The eSeL-initiative grew from an independent online medium for of art information and event listings to an institutional carrier and server for art activities in Vienna, combined with focused interventions through projects, performances, and exhibitions. Reaching a young audience beyond the art circles, eSeL's information services deliberately feature upcoming initiatives next to well- established art positions from all fields of artistic practice in Vienna (Fine Arts, performance, dance, art-in-public space, film, media art, music and civil society's artistic activities, inviting participation by new artists as well as the audience).

Pouncival centre front row Carbucketty is a character from the musical Cats. The name was one of T. S. Eliot's ideas for cat names, for a \\"knockabout cat\\". His role is primarily that of a dancer and acrobat. Carbucketty appeared in both the original London and Broadway shows. In 1987, when the Broadway show was reworked, the character was renamed Mungojerrie. The actor who played Mungojerrie after the show was reworked, Ray Roderick, had played Carbucketty for a few months prior. Carbucketty's costume suggests a Bi-colour tabby and white kitten. He has defined stripes as well as spots on a white base. A short fluffy wig and chunky warmers give the impression of a young, fluffy kitten. Most fans consider Carbucketty to be a counterpart of Pouncival- a kitten with a similar personality and design who appears in many productions around the world. This may be because for the filmed version of the show the costume and role of Carbucketty was named Pouncival, as it was deemed more sensible for an international market to use the names used internationally. However Carbucketty and Pouncival is one and the same part. For the entire record breaking 21-year run of Cats in London the part was named Carbucketty.

Life Pak was born in Anseong, 40 miles from Seoul in modern-day South Korea, an area to which he often refers nostalgically in his poetry. His family was too poor to give him any formal education, but two early poems of his appeared in the publication Munjang (Literary composition) in 1939. After Korea's liberation, he created the Korean Young Writers' Association alongside Kim Tong-ni, Cho Yeonhyeon, and Seo Jeongju. At that time he shared a first collection of poetry with Park Mok-wol and Cho Chi-hun. This was the Blue Deer Anthology (Cheongnokjip, 1946), which was followed by individual collections of his own, Hae (The Sun, 1949), Odo (A Prayer at Noon, 1953) and several more, distinguished by their treatment of nature. The poet worked in a managerial position until 1945, then in publishing and later as a professor in various universities.‚ÄùPak Dujin\\" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do# Among the awards given his poetry were the Asian Free Literature Prize (1956), Seoul City Cultural Award (1962), Samil Culture Award (1970), Korean Academy of Art Prize (1976) and the Inchon Prize (1988). Work The Literature Translation Institute of Korea summarizes the contribution made to Korean literature by Pak Tu-jin (who sometimes wrote under the pen name ‚ÄòHyesan‚Äô): :Park Dujin is one of the most prolific and renowned poets in all of modern Korean literature...Through verses that sing of green meadows, twittering birds, frolicking deer, and setting suns, the poet is often understood by critics to be presenting his own creative commentary on social and political issues. According to one theorist, ‚ÄúA Fragrant Hill‚Äù (HyangHyeon), one of Park‚Äôs first published poems, uses just such imagery to prophecy Korea‚Äôs liberation from Japan. The ‚Äòpeaceful co-existence of wild animals and plants‚Äô in ‚ÄúHyangHyeon‚Äù, for example, can be interpreted as standing for the ‚Äòlatent power of the nation,‚Äô with the flame that rises from the ridge symbolizing the ‚Äòcreative passion of the people.‚Äô Source-attribution\\"Pak Dujin\\" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do# :It is because of this particular significance held by the natural symbols in Park‚Äôs poetry that the lyrical quality of his poems is set apart from the romantic, pastoral lyricism of many other representative Korean poets. The role of the natural world in Park Dujin‚Äôs poetry is that of a catalyst for understanding the world of man, rather than an end in itself. To 'characterize (his) poetic stance as involving a state of exchange between or joining of the self and nature', according to literary critic Cho Yeonhyeon, 'is incorrect from the outset. Park operates from a standpoint that presupposes the impossibility of even distinguishing between the two'.Source-attribution\\"Pak Dujin\\" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do# :With the further publication of his collections ... Park also began to draw a Christian ideal into his poetry and, in so doing, to display a particular poetic direction. Inspired by a powerful consciousness of his people‚Äôs situation in the aftermath of the Korean War, Park went on to publish works that demonstrated both rage and criticism in reference to various policies and social realities that he himself saw to be nothing short of absurd. Even through the sixties, with the collections The Spider and the Constellation (Geomi wa Seongjwa, 1962) and A Human Jungle (Ingan millim, 1963), Park continued to seek a creative resolution to the trials of his time, representing history not as a given, but as a process shaped by all its participants. The monument at Pak Tu-jin's birthplace, inscribed with one of his poems The onomatopoeia, figurative expressions, and the poetic statements in prose form used so boldly are perhaps the most notable technical devices in Park's poems from this period. With the onset of the 1970s, when he published such collections as Chronicles of Water and Stone (Suseok yeoljeon, 1973) and Poongmuhan, the nature of his poetry evolved once again; founded now on private self-realization, these poems are often said to reveal Park's attainment of the absolute pinnacle of self-discovery at which ‚Äòinfinite time and space are traveled freely.‚Äô As such, Park, known as an artist who elevated poetry to the level of ethics and religion, is today evaluated more as a poet of thematic consciousness than of technical sophistication.Source-attribution\\"Pak Dujin\\" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do# His poem ‚ÄúPeaches are in bloom‚Äù is a good example of the way his rapturous and incantatory verse unites cultural and personal references to make it expressively symbolic of his country. > Tell them that the peaches are in bloom and the apricots By the warm home > you left abandoned, and now on that hedge once recklessly trampled, cherries > and plums ripen. Bees and butterflies praise the day, and the cuckoo sings > by moonlight. In the five continents and six oceans, O Ch‚Äô√¥l, beyond the > hoofed clouds and winged skies, into which corner shall I look in order to > stand face to face with you?

In recent years the band has gravitated towards a melodic death metal sound. History Detonation was founded in 1997 under the name Infernal Dream. The band started out with Koen Romeijn on vocals/guitar, Mike Ferguson on guitar, and Thomas Kalksma on drums. In August 1998, Otto Schimmelpenninck van der Oije joined the band as bass player. The band's name was changed to Detonation in 1998 and entered a studio for the first time to record two songs for the Crushed Skull Compilation Volume 1 CD. A month later, Detonation performed live for the first time. The Crushed Skull compilation was released in January 1999 through Skull Crusher Records. In October of that same year, the band entered the studio for the second time to record the MCD, Lost Euphoria, which contained four songs. Lost Euphoria was released in January 2000 through Skull Crusher Records. After the release, Detonation played ten shows as the supporting act for the Dutch metal band Orphanage. In March 2001, Detonation entered the studio again to record three new songs that were to be released as a promo CD meant primarily for labels and venues. After playing numerous shows, which also included Detonation's first show outside The Netherlands (Open Hell Fest in the Czech Republic), the band decided to record their debut studio album, An Epic Defiance. The album was recorded within two weeks at Studio Excess and contained twelve songs. The artwork was done by Niklas Sundin (Dark Tranquillity) for Cabin Fever Media. On October 19, 2002, An Epic Defiance was self-released and sent to record labels. The album caught the attention of the French record label, Osmose Productions and Detonation signed a recording contract for three albums. An Epic Defiance was officially re-released worldwide on CD and limited LP on June 19, 2003. In July 2003, Detonation successfully completed their first foreign tour, playing three shows throughout England. After promoting the album in the Netherlands, the band again headed to the UK to successfully complete a ten-day tour throughout the country. In February 2004, Detonation took part in a thirteen-day European tour as a support act for Dimension Zero along with Immemorial. In August 2004, the band was forced to recruit a session drummer due to an arm injury of Thomas. Fedor Tieleman of the Dutch band M-90‚Äôs was recruited as the session member. In December 2004, Detonation entered Excess Studios once again to record their second studio album, Portals to Uphobia. Due to numerous problems the official release date was delayed until September 12, 2005. Detonation then toured with Decapitated, Gorerotted, and Dam. Over 30 shows were scheduled throughout Europe, but due to a breakdown of the rented tour bus, Detonation had to cancel several shows. The band eventually managed to complete about half of the shows with their own transportation. In January 2007, Detonation recorded their third studio album, Emission Phase, which was released at the end of April 2007. The artwork was made by Eliran Kantor and the production was taken care of by Bouke Visser and Jochem Jacobs from Split Second Sound. The release was promoted by an eight- day tour throughout the UK and several individual gigs (festival) in the Netherlands. On March 17, 2008, the band announced their first ever line-up change. Koen Romeijn who had been playing Rhythmic guitar/Vocals since 1997 decided to lay down his guitar and focus on the vocals. The person they chose to replace him was Danny Tunker from Fuelblooded and The Saturnine. On May 3, 2008, Detonation announced that their drummer Thomas Kalksma (who was also a forming member of the band) had decided to leave the band for differences of opinion about the future of Detonation. He left in good terms and mentioned that he would continue his drummer career. In November 2008, Michiel van der Plicht joined the band as the permanent new drummer, after already doing a couple of shows as session member. At the end of 2011, the band recorded their fourth studio effort \\"Reprisal\\", produced by Harry van Breda. It was released in April 2011. Before the album was released, Michiel van der Plicht, Danny Tunker and Otto Schimmelpenninck van der Oije left the band to focus and their other bands (God Dethroned and Delain, respectively).

It runs south-westerly, straight from Edgware Road to Craven Road, Spring Street and Eastbourne Terrace. History Praed Street was originally laid out in the early 19th century, being built up in 1828. It was named after William Praed, chairman of the company which built the canal basin which lies just to the north. In 1893 plans were put forward by the Edgware Road and Victoria Railway company to build an underground railway along the Edgware Road which included the construction of a Tube station at Praed Street. The scheme was rejected by Parliament and the line was never built. Overview On the north west side of the street are Paddington Station and the Great Western Hotel, the Royal Mail Western depot, and St Mary's Hospital. The south east side is predominantly retail but includes the frontage for Paddington Underground (Bakerloo, Circle and District lines) station. At the far north east end, on the north west side, is a prominent 1980s extension to the Hilton London Metropole Hotel. Affecting Underground railway staff and travellers, Praed Street is the site of a crucial junction of the Hammersmith & City and Circle lines. Problems at this junction cause many delays on the Circle, District and Hammersmith & City lines. Westbound Hammersmith & City trains need to turn in front of eastbound Circle or District trains bound for Edgware Road. During normal operation, trains are signalled across the junction in the order they appear in the timetable. So, if an eastbound Circle or District train is scheduled into Edgware road station first, then a westbound train would have to wait. Similarly if a Hammersmith & City line train is coming off the branch, then any eastbound train from Paddington will have to wait. Typically, trains queue up to get into Edgware Road from Paddington (Circle line) and Baker Street. A further complication is that all trains are held to time by the Edgware Road signal box. Morocco maintains a consulate at number 97-99.  In literature and film  Solar Pons, a pastiche of Sherlock Holmes created by August Derleth, had his offices based at 7B Praed Street.Derleth, A. (1928) The Adventure of the Norcross Riddle, reprinted in In Re: Sherlock Holmes (Mycroft & Moran, 1945) American poet Richard Hugo wrote the poem \\"Walking Praed Street\\", which first appeared in his book of poems, The Lady in Kicking Horse Reservoir. The poem's first two lines are said to be two of the greatest American lines ever written: \\"I've walked this street in far too many towns./ The weather, briefly: in Salerno, rain.\\" Praed Street appeared in the political thriller novel House of Cards, and subsequently in its television adaptation, as an accommodation address set up by main protagonist Francis Urquhart as part of a plot to force the resignation of the sitting Prime Minister. Praed Street is the setting for the novel The Murders in Praed Street by John Rhode. Praed Street is mentioned in Ira Levin's Rosemary's Baby. Somebody compares a house there with the house (Bramford in New York) where the protagonists live: \\"There was a house in London, on Praed Street, in which five separate brutal murders took place within sixty years.\\" In The Dark Labyrinth by Lawrence Durrell, a character complains he 'could not be carried away by fairy tales of the Second Coming written in this Praed Street vein' (chapter three).

Early life Born in Gouyave, Grenada in 1900, when it was part of the British Windward Islands, to George Hutchinson and Marianne (n√©e Turnbull), Hutch took piano lessons as a child. In 1916, he moved to New York City while still in his teens. He originally emigrated to study for a degree in medicine as he had won a place due to his high aptitude, but instead he began playing the piano and singing in bars. Career In New York City, Hutch joined a black band led by Henry \\"Broadway\\" Jones, who often played for white millionaires such as the Vanderbilts, attracting the wrath of the Ku Klux Klan. In 1924 Hutch left America for Paris, where he had a residency in Joe Zelli's club and became a friend and lover of Cole Porter.[ \\"Hutch\\" at Allmusic] Encouraged by Edwina Mountbatten, he came to England in 1927 to perform in a Rodgers and Hart musical, and soon became the darling of society and the population in general. Hutch was a favourite singer of the then Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII). Hutch was a major star in Britain during the 1920s and 1930s, and was, for a time, the highest paid star in the country. He was regularly heard on air with the BBC. One of his biggest hits was his version of \\"These Foolish Things\\". In spite of his popularity, Hutch could not escape racial prejudice. Hutch recorded several of Cole Porter's songs, including \\"Begin the Beguine\\" and Porter's list song \\"Let's Do It (Let's Fall in Love)\\", to which he supposedly made up some 70 new verses. Hutch was \\"one of the first stars in Britain\\" to volunteer to entertain the troops at home and abroad during World War II, but he received no formal recognition for his service, and his name would never appear in any Honours list. Personal life He married Ella Byrd, a woman of African, English, and Chinese ancestry, in 1923 or 1924 in New York City. Their daughter, Lesley Bagley Yvonne, was born on 9 April 1926. He fathered seven further children with six different mothers. Gordon was born in August 1928, Gabrielle in September 1930, Jennifer in October 1939, Gerald and Chris in 1948, and Graham (Chris's full brother) in 1953, and Emma in April 1965.For several years in the mid-1920s Hutchinson lived with Zena Naylor, the illegitimate daughter of art dealer and historian Robert Langton Douglas; later a literary editor, she was briefly a lover of composer Vernon Duke, artist Ralph Barton, and British artist Tony Butts: D. J. Taylor, Bright Young Things: The Lost Generation of London's Jazz Age (Macmillan, 2010), p. 130; Vernon Duke, Passport to Paris (Little Brown, 1955), p. 163; Carl Van Vechten and Bruce Kellner, The Splendid Drunken Twenties (University of Illinois Press, 2003), p. 137; and Nathalie Blondel, The Journals of Mary Butts (Yale University Press, 2002), p. 24. In 1930, one of Hutch's mistresses, British debutante Elizabeth Corbett, was discovered to be pregnant with his child. Her family tried to hush up the affair, hastily marrying Corbett off to an army officer, and attempting to pass off the child as his. When the child was born, however, and discovered to be of mixed race, Corbett's husband refused to acknowledge her as his own. She (Gabrielle) was put up for adoption and Corbett's outraged father sued Hutch.David Olusoga, Black and British: A Forgotten History (2016), BBC. Hutch is rumoured to have had a lengthy affair in the mid-1930s with Edwina Mountbatten. The rumour scandalized the British upper classes, becoming the subject of tabloid news, and an embarrassment to Lady Mountbatten's royal in-laws. The Mountbattens sued the tabloids for libel. As a result of the scandal, Hutch was shunned by many of his former patrons.David Olusoga, Black and British: A Forgotten History (2016), BBC. Other reported mistresses were the Hollywood actors Tallulah Bankhead and Merle Oberon. Hutch may have been bisexual and was alleged to have had relationships with Cole Porter, and Ivor Novello.Charlotte Breese, Hutch, Bloomsbury Publishing, 1999. Death Hutchinson's grave in Highgate Cemetery Leslie Hutchinson suffered from ill-health in his later years and died in London from pneumonia on 19 August 1969. Forty-two people attended his funeral. Legacy On 12 October 2012, an English Heritage blue plaque in commemoration of Hutch was unveiled by his daughter Gabrielle Markes at 31 Steele's Road, Belsize Park, his home from 1929 to 1967.\\"Our Heritage: Leslie 'Hutch' Hutchinson Remembered ‚Äî English Heritage Blue Plaque for Leslie 'Hutch‚Äù Hutchinson', 1 October 2012.Dan Carrier, \\"Stephen Fry unveils plaque to forgotten singer who escaped the Ku Klux Klan before making and losing a fortune\\" , Camden New Journal, 11 October 2012. In November 2016, Hutch was featured in episode four of the BBC series Black and British: A Forgotten History, titled The Homecoming, presented by historian David Olusoga. On the occasion of the programme, a plaque was unveiled by two of his children, Gabrielle and her half-brother Chris, in the presence of extended family at Mayfair restaurant Quaglino's, where he used to perform later in his career.\\"Black And British: A Forgotten History\\", BBC Media Centre, 30 November 2016.

Career World Championship Wrestling Johnson gained national exposure in the late 1990s when he joined the Atlanta, Georgia-based World Championship Wrestling (WCW) promotion as a referee. After suffering elbow injuries in 1998 caused during a match by Konnan, he was sidelined until late 1999. When he returned, Johnson was given the gimmick of an unethical referee who actively favoured heel wrestlers (as opposed to the other referees, who officiated matches in an objective fashion). While in WCW, he was a member of the New World Order faction, wrestled several matches, refereed a total of eighty five main events and had the dubious distinction of being pantsed by Stacy Keibler during a match on pay-per-view. He remained with WCW until the promotion was purchased by the World Wrestling Federation in March 2001. In late 2001, Johnson toured Western Europe with the World Wrestling All-Stars promotion. Total Nonstop Action Wrestling Johnson worked for the Nashville, Tennessee based Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) promotion from its inception in 2002, portraying a corrupt referee who accepted bribes, continuing the character he first adopted in WCW. He left TNA after several months to focus on his rock band, The Slick Johnsons, which was entering a Battle of the Bands in an attempt to gain a recording contract. He returned to the promotion in March 2005, replacing Mike Posey as a regular referee. At Against All Odds on February 12, 2006, Johnson confronted Director of Authority Larry Zbyszko, demanding to know who was to referee the main event title match between Christian Cage and NWA World Heavyweight Champion Jeff Jarrett, suggesting that his experience in WCW made him an appropriate choice of referee. His inquiry was rebuffed by Zbyszko, who later revealed the referee to be the debuting Earl Hebner. Over the following weeks, Johnson repeatedly requested to referee main event matches, with Zbyszko rejecting his appeals each time. Zbyszko eventually was about to give in to Johnson's incessant requests when Johnson suddenly withdrew his request to become a senior referee. Johnson explained that TNA management would be sending in a new representative in the near future, and that everyone would have a clean slate at that point. This sparked the storyline of the new face of TNA management, in which backstage dialogue between Zbyszko and Johnson served to build up the debut of the newest authority figure in TNA Wrestling, later revealed at Slammiversary to be none other than Jim Cornette. During this time Johnson would frequently wear outrageous referee uniforms, such as elaborate bowties and striped shorts akin to those worn by a soccer referee. On June 13, 2007, he left TNA to pursue other interests. At Bound for Glory on October 14, 2007, Johnson returned to TNA Wrestling as a full-time referee. At Final Resolution in 2008, he refereed a match between Gail Kim and Awesome Kong. Johnson was powerbombed and hit with a chair by Awesome Kong. At Victory Road, he turned heel again when he helped Angelina Love of The Beautiful People regain the TNA Women's Knockout Championship even though Tara clearly had her foot on the ropes. Later on in the pay-per-view, Slick was seen leaving the Knockouts shower room and as he left, Madison Rayne of The Beautiful People came out from the same cubicle as him adjusting her top, implying that the two had sex. However, it didn't last; he resumed being fair to both faces and heels shortly thereafter. Johnson left TNA in late 2010.

The site is written in the form of a tumblelog called The Linked List, a linklog with brief commentary, in between occasional longform articles that discuss Apple products and issues in related consumer technology. Gruber often writes about user interfaces, software development, Mac applications, and Apple's media coverage. The original Daring Fireball T-shirt In 2004, Gruber began selling memberships, where readers donate an amount of money annually and gain access to other perks. The perks included more detailed feeds, but Gruber has downplayed the importance of the extra features, comparing them to \\"PBS tote bags.\\" Daring Fireball logo T-shirts are also sold, which include a membership. Gruber's last account of his part-time Daring Fireball income called it a substantial side income, short of a full-time salary. For most of the time when Daring Fireball was a part-time project, Gruber worked as an independent web designer; between late 2005 and April 2006, Gruber's main job was at Joyent where he helped with the TextDrive acquisition. In April 2006, producing Daring Fireball became Gruber's full-time job, funded by advertisement revenue, membership fees, T-shirt sales, and donations from software projects also hosted on the site, such as Markdown. From 2006 to 2017, the site displayed advertisements from The Deck, an advertising network serving sites like A List Apart and 37signals in addition to Daring Fireball. In addition to this, many Amazon.com links once carried Daring Fireball's referral ID, and the site's preferences once included a choice of local Amazon store. Amazon removed Daring Fireball from their affiliate program for a violation of their terms of service. The Talk Show The Talk Show is a technology podcast started by Gruber intended as a \\"director's commentary\\" to his website, Daring Fireball. In June 2007, Gruber and Dan Benjamin began co-hosting an independent podcast featuring conversations and commentary on trends, mainly focusing on technology at thetalkshow.net. This format persisted but the show \\"started over\\" and helped establish Benjamin's 5by5 Studios network. The show ran from July 2010 until May 2012 for a total of 90 episodes. Gruber moved the show to the Mule Radio SyndicateMule Radio Syndicate Network network in May 2012. This time, Gruber changed the format and became the sole host of the show with alternating guests each episode. The show ran for 80 episodes and in May 2014, The Talk Show parted ways with Mule Radio and became part of Daring Fireball. The show continues to use the episode number scheme and logo started at Mule Radio. While Gruber has remained a constant through all four iterations of the show, archives of the show's episodes are inconsistent. The initial 27 episodes that were co-hosted with Benjamin were removed by Dan in 2016. Only some of the episodes created during the time at Mule Radio remain available. Guests are mainly programmers, designers, analysts and journalists. Some recurring guests include John Moltz, Marco Arment, Merlin Mann, Craig Hockenberry, John Siracusa, Rene Ritchie, Guy English, MG Siegler, Ben Thompson, Joanna Stern, Brent Simmons, Om Malik, Jason Snell, Christa Mrgan, Dave Wiskus, Matthew Panzarino, and Serenity Caldwell. Apple Inc. senior vice president (SVP) of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller appeared as a guest on the live episode of The Talk Show during WWDC 2015 in San Francisco. Apple SVPs Eddy Cue and Craig Federighi appeared as guests on a recorded episode published February 12, 2016. Phil Schiller and Craig Federighi also appeared on the live episodes of The Talk Show during WWDC 2016 and 2017. The Talk Show is known for its lengthy episodes.

The group controls the development of solar power technologies at all levels in-house. SolarWorld AG is listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the Photovoltaik Global 30 Index and the √ñkoDAX. In May 2017, wholly owned subsidiary SolarWorld Americas, based in Oregon, US, joined fellow American solar panel manufacturer Suniva in its Section 201 trade action to request relief from what it claimed are unfair practices from solar panel importers to the United States. The requested remedy was a tariff on imported solar panels. FirstSolar, the largest US solar panel manufacturer, joined the action on October 10, 2017, while the Solar Energy Industry Association (the major American solar trade association) was leading the opposition to the tariff requests. The company filed for insolvency of its German subsidiaries alone in May 2017. While subsidiary SolarWorld America was not itself insolvent, it subsequently was put up for sale or other action to help resolve the debts of the German parent company. In the beginning of August 2017, leaving all liabilities behind, all the assets alone were acquired by the original Founder of SolarWorld Ag, Frank Asbeck along with Qatar Solar Technologies (QSTec) to form SolarWorld Industries GmbH, thus becoming completely debt-free and the only Solar Manufacturer in the world with zero-debt and zero liability. According to the Press Release issued by SolarWorld Industries GmbH, it will now have just 500 employees, drastically down from earlier, thus cutting costs. According to the company, the company will continue its transition to mono PERC-only cells production. The new entity, SolarWorld Industries GmbH takes over the production facilities and distribution businesses in Europe, Asia and Africa. \\"We plan to start with a production capacity of 700 MW, which can also be boosted to the previous capacity of more than 1GW. At launch, the company will have 515 employees. Of these, more than 12% are employed in research and more than 5% are trainees,‚Äù he said adding that the new company had already signed a 25MW order, without giving further details. The newly founded SolarWorld Industries GmbH filed for insolvency again in March 2018.SolarWorld Industries GmbH files for insolvency proceedings 28. March 2018 In June 2018 the regional public TV station MDR reported, that most of SolarWorlds production workers have been transferred into other forms of employment and production will be closed by end of September.Mitarbeiter von Solarworld in Freiberg steigen aus Produktion aus  History  SolarWorld was founded in 1988 as individual company by engineer and chief executive officer Frank Asbeck, and engaged in projects to produce renewable energy. In 1998, these activities were transferred to the newly founded SolarWorld AG, which went public on 11 August 1999. In 2006 Shell divested its crystalline silicon solar business activities to SolarWorld. SolarWorld has received German Sustainability Award in the category of \\"Germany‚Äôs Most Sustainable Production 2008\\".http://www.dgap.de/link.php?sprache=en&a;=10&v;=en&von;=19970101&typ;=news‚àà=DE0005108401&id;=393370 Since 2010 the company has a joint venture with Qatar Solar Technologies (QSTec).http://www.solarworld-usa.com/newsroom/news- releases/news/2010/solarworld-concludes-joint-venture-with-qatar-foundation Due to a financial crisis, Solarworld was restructured and QSTec became the largest shareholder in 2013.http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/wirtschaft/neuer- partner-qatar-solar-solarworld-schoepft-wieder-hoffnung-3166686 In 2012, Washington, D.C. based law firm, Wiley Rein, was hacked. According to Bloomberg News, the hackers wanted information about the German manufacturer SolarWorld. SolarWorld's computers were hacked about the same time. In 2016, SolarWorld started ‚Äògradually‚Äô migrating cell production to PERC and five busbar technology. At the core of SolarWorld‚Äôs high-tech strategy is migrating all solar cell production to PERC (Passivated Emitter Rear Cell) technology and moving from three busbars to five in order to boost conversion efficiencies and limit capital expenditures at the same time as these changes are relatively simple and low-risk ramps, compared to entire new cell concepts such as heterojunction, according to Neuhaus at PV CellTech. SolarWorld‚Äôs PV CellTech presentation also revealed that average efficiencies of PERC cells in high-volume production had achieved 21.4%, resulting in PV module power distribution average of 303.3W. SolarWorld has also developed a bi-facial version of its current PERC cell that has entered production and more capacity is expected to be allocated to bi-facial cells and modules. On May 10, 2017, SolarWorld AG filed for insolvency citing ‚Äúongoing price distortions‚Äù and ‚Äúno longer a positive forecast for the future‚Äù. According to Mr. Piepenburg, the administrator, it is now of major importance to maintain business operations as smoothly as possible. In May 2016, a lawsuit brought by U.S. silicon supplier Hemlock was reported as \\"threatening the continued existence of the company\\" with damage claims up to $770 million. The German facilities of SolarWorld were purchased by its founder Frank Asbeck in conjunction with Qatar Solar Technologies. Three days later, an appeals court upheld the verdict in the Hemlock case, resulting in SolarWorld AG being responsible to pay the damage claims. SolarWorld Americas, the largest U.S. crystalline- silicon solar manufacturer for more than 42 years, is continuing to implement efficiencies and working with external partners to position the company for stabilization and a continued competitive position in the marketplace. Solarworld USA spokesman Ben Santarris said the company is sticking with the assumption of continuing normal operations, and continued to work with suppliers and customers to determine what the right size of the company should be going forward. On Aug. 18, 2017, however, news came that the German administrator of SolarWorld AG's bankruptcy had put SolarWorld Americas up for sale, though no potential buyers had been identified at that time. The US- based subsidiary, which reportedly produced half of \\"SolarWorld\\" branded modules worldwide, was put \\"in something of a limbo\\" by the bankruptcy and a spokesperson stated the company had entered an \\"open ended\\" mergers and acquisitions process.  Facilities  Within the SolarWorld Group many specialized workers were employed in the enterprise's units located in Bonn (headquarters), Freiberg, and Hillsboro, Oregon (US headquarters). The business also had a manufacturing facility in Hillsboro, Oregon, purchased in 2007 from Japan's Komatsu Group. In 2008, it was the largest solar cell manufacturing facility in North America. That factory was taken over by SunPower in October 2018, as part of SunPower's acquisition of SolarWorld Americas. International distribution center in Bonn, Germany In 2013 SolarWorld took over production from Bosch Solar Energy in Arnstadt and continued to employ about 800 workers.http://www.pv- tech.org/news/official_solarworld_signs_deal_with_bosch_to_buy_cell_module_facilities_in SolarWorld AG has sales offices in Germany, Spain, US, South Africa, UK and Singapore.  Grid parity  In 2010, SolarWorld called for lowering Germany's lucrative solar feed-in tariffs and its CEO, Frank Asbeck, supported a 10 percent to 15 percent drop for the incentives. In 2011, utility-scale solar power stations achieved grid parity for domestic consumers as guaranteed tariffs fell below retail electricity prices. Feed-in tariffs continued to drop well below the gross domestic electricity price. Since the beginning of 2012, newly installed, small rooftop PV system also have achieved grid parity. The current policy is to revise tariffs on a monthly basis reducing them by 1 percent unless actual deployment does not meet agreed upon targets. As of spring 2015, tariffs ranged from 8 to 12 euro-cents per kilowatt-hour depending on the PV system's size.  Vehicles  The solar car SolarWorld No. 1 SolarWorld is the main sponsor of the SolarWorld No. 1 solar car developed by the FH Bochum SolarCar Team. On 19 November 2008, SolarWorld AG announced a bid to buy German automaker Opel from General Motors. The bid was for 1 billion Euro, 250 million being paid in cash and 750 million being paid in bank credits. SolarWorld specified conditions such as Opel should be split from General Motors. Solarworld announced that it intends to create the first electric automotive OEM.

It is on the Far North Line. It was designed in 1868 (with a combined post office) by the architect William Fowler. The station opened on 13 April 1868. Originally, it was the northern terminus of the Sutherland Railway, which had been intended to continue to Brora but had run out of money after reaching Golspie. The Duke of Sutherland used his own personal finances to build the line onwards through Brora to Helmsdale, this being the Duke of Sutherland's Railway, completed on 19 June 1871. Golspie station was designed by William Fowler and built in 1868, Golspie Station House which sits on the unmanned platform was converted in 2002/2003 to a four bedroom home. The station formerly had two platforms and a passing loop. One platform remains in use and the loop has been lifted. The station building is in an excellent state of repair following recent renovation. The former goods yard is to the south of the station. The station was host to a LMS caravan from 1935 to 1939. A camping coach was also positioned here by the Scottish Region from 1957 to 1959 and 1964, no coaches were at the station in 1960 and 1961, then a Pullman camping coach was here in 1962, 1963 and 1965 and finally two ordinary coaches were here in 1966 and 1967. The 'Golspie North' and 'Golspie South' signalboxes are demolished. The Duke of Sutherland had an engine shed for his engine Dunrobin (and replacement with the same name). The station is from , and has a single platform which is long enough for a seven-coach train.

It featured the eponymous agency set up to investigate anomalous phenomena and conspiracy theories. It was influenced by American TV drama The X-Files (which was at the height of its popularity at the time) and other events such as the 1995 release of the alien autopsy film; as the general interest in the paranormal and parapolitics waned, the series was wound up and replaced by Pulp Sci-Fi as a venue for single issue self-contained stories. In turn it foreshadowed other comics series dedicated to similar agencies, such as Caballistics, Inc. and the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense. The format was created by former 2000 AD editor and long-time contributor Alan McKenzie. Plot Each story was presented by the Men in Black, as being a true file from their cases touching on a whole range of Forteana from Mothman to the Chupacabras and broader conspiracy theories such as those surrounding Project MKULTRA. In the middle of the series run (and as the interest in such subjects peaked) the MiB even broke out of their own strip and fictionally took over the running of the magazine from #1014 (appearing as part of the logo from #1015), as Tharg was allegedly away dealing with a crisis.

He was the son of The 3rd Viscount Avonmore and Cecilia O'Keeffe. Major William Charles Yelverton gained the rank of Major in the service of the Royal Artillery. He was invested as a Knight, Order of the Medjidie 5th class. He was usually known to family and friends as Charles. Marriages The Hon. William Charles Yelverton (as he was styled 1824‚Äì1870) married, firstly, Maria Theresa Longworth (died 1881) on 15 August 1857 in Rostrevor, County Down, Ireland. The marriage was dissolved. The union was childless. He married, secondly, Mrs. Emily Marianne Forbes (n√©e Ashworth), daughter of Maj.-Gen.

History Ireland Feature ‚Äì The Yelverton Affair. Retrieved 21 November 2011 Under a Statute of King George II (19 Geo. 2. c. 13), any marriage between a Catholic (Popish) and a Protestant or a marriage between two Protestants celebrated by a Catholic priest was null and void. Between 21 February 1861 and 4 March 1861, the trial of Thelwall v. Yelverton found that even though Major Yelverton was a Protestant, and Miss Longworth a Roman Catholic, and though they had been married by a Roman Catholic priest, the marriage was valid. In March 1861 he was suspended from all military duties. On 28 July 1864 on appeal, the decision of Thelwall v. Yelverton was reversed, and the House of Lords decided that William's first marriage was illegal, and therefore his second marriage was valid. Children Major The Hon.

The ridge is thought to be a result of the passage of the Nazca Plate over the Galapagos hotspot. It is named for the research vessel Carnegie, which discovered it in 1929. Extent The Carnegie Ridge is seen to extend eastwards over 1,000 km from the Galapagos islands to the Colombia-Ecuador trench and is interpreted to continue beneath northern Ecuador for about a further 700 km. The subducted extent is disputed, with some workers arguing that there is no evidence of a subducted ridge beneath Ecuador extending more than about 60 km from the trench. Structure The Carnegie Ridge consists of thickened oceanic crust. Wide-angle seismic reflection and refraction data acquired over the central and eastern part of the ridge give crustal thicknesses of 13 km and 19 km respectively for crust that has estimated ages of about 11 Ma and 20 Ma. Layer 2 thicknesses are similar to the neighbouring normal oceanic crust with thickening taking place in layer 3. History The formation of the Carnegie Ridge and other aseismic ridges in this part of the Pacific started at about 20 Ma when the Galapagos hotspot formed, following the break-up of the Farallon Plate and the formation of the separate Cocos and Nazca Plates. At about 19.5 Ma, the Galapagos Rise spreading center moved so that most of the hotspot magmatism affected the Nazca Plate, forming the combined Carnegie and Malpelo Ridges. At about 14.5 Ma the spreading center jumped south, such that most of the magmatism affected the Cocos Plate and caused the Malpelo Ridge to rift away from the Carnegie Ridge. This stage caused the narrowing of the Carnegie Ridge now seen between 85¬∞ W and 87¬∞ W. At about 9.5 Ma rifting between the Malpelo and Carnegie Ridges ceased. The Galapagos Rise moved north again at about 5 Ma, leaving the hotspot entirely within the Nazca Plate, which is the current situation. Subduction The onset of subduction of the Carnegie Ridge beneath the South American Plate has been dated variously from about mid-Miocene (15 Ma) to about Pleistocene (2 Ma). Although there is agreement that the ridge is being subducted, there is little agreement on the effect that this has had on either the subducting or over-riding plates. Some models argue that the buoyancy associated with the thickened crust of the ridge has caused the downgoing Nazca Plate to tear, leaving a relatively flat section carrying the ridge, flanked by two sections with steeper dip. The presence of a flat section is not supported by a more recent study of earthquake hypocenters, which found a constant dip of about 25¬∞-35¬∞ down to 200 km.

Harold Dermott and his company, D&H; Fibreglass Techniques, of Greenfield, Oldham, Greater Manchester, England came to an agreement in 1975 with Marcos cars to take over production of their Mini Marcos model. The car, with its odd-ball looks, was looking outdated so Dermott asked the designer Richard Oakes to come up with a new model. The new car, which was called the Midas, was launched at the 1978 Performance Car Show in London. The car had a composite body with no chassis, using the Mini engine/gearbox and front subframe but replacing the rear subframe with a beam on which the trailing arms were hinged. In 1981 an updated model was introduced with improvements suggested by Gordon Murray of the Brabham Formula 1 team at the time. The car was available in three versions called Gold and Bronze depending on completeness. Demand for cars was now outstripping the small workshop in Oldham so a move was made to a factory in Corby, Northamptonshire and the company name changed to Midas Cars Ltd. Further improvements were made in 1985 when the Midas Gold was adapted to take Austin or MG Metro parts. A restyle was also made at the same time, again by Richard Oakes, involving wider wings, a \\"frogeye\\" front and larger windows. Gordon Murray provided input to improve the aerodynamics. In order to sell complete cars as well as kits a Midas successfully underwent a full ECE12 crash test. A convertible version appeared in 1989 and featured on the front cover of Car magazine, but all production stopped in March 1989 when the premises were destroyed by fire. New ownership The rights to the car were purchased in 1990 by Pastiche Cars of Rotherham, Yorkshire who relaunched the range and made a handful of convertibles before the receivers were called in again in 1991 and sold the Gold Convertible on to GTM Cars of Sutton Bonnington, Nottinghamshire. GTM added a series of changes including Hydragas suspension and a hardtop. The range continued to develop with, in 1995 a new 2+2 coup√© based on the K-Series engined Metro and Rover 100 models. The moulds of the Gold coupe were sold to Berlin, Germany by GTM in 1990 where they were used for an unemployment project. In the meantime the old Mini based Midas had reappeared being made by Midtech cars for a short time. In 2001 the Midas changed hands again when GTM sold it to a new Midas Cars Ltd based in Redditch, West Midlands. The range now consisted of the Coup√©, renamed the Cortez, and a K-Series powered convertible named the Excelsior. Although the cars were well received the company went into liquidation in 2003. A new company, Alternative Cars Ltd was set up in 2003 and in 2004 restarted production of kit form versions of the Gold Convertible, Cortez and Excelsior based in a small workshop unit at Clanfield, Oxfordshire. In 2007 the Midas Owners Club rediscovered the Gold coupe moulds in Germany and bought them and were imported back to England.

Opened on December 5, 1994, it focuses on the research and production of new biopharmaceutical products for the treatment of cancer and other nontransmissible diseases. Facilities The design and construction of the Center of Molecular Immunology was modeled on current Good Manufacturing Practice guidelines recommended by the World Health Organization and adopted by Cuba, particularly those also adopted by the member countries of the European Union, then known as the European Community. Research labs, production areas and administrative offices share the 15,000 square meters of the two floor facility. Approximately 800 employees work at the CIM, most of them scientists and engineers. These personnel are administratively organized in three main areas: Research and Development, Production, and Quality Assurance. Research Basic research projects are focused on cancer immunotherapy, especially the development of molecular vaccines. These include antibody engineering, cellular engineering, bioinformatics and regulation of the immune response. CIM conducts clinical trials in diagnostic imaging and cancer therapy of varying origin, as well as other immune system diseases, in highly specialized hospitals. In August 2011 it was announced that the Center of Molecular Immunology released CimaVax-EGF, the first therapeutic cancer vaccine for lung cancer. In December 2012, a new therapeutic cancer vaccine was approved by Cuban regulatory agency. CIMAbid (racotumomab or 1E10)obtained conditional approval for the treatment of lung cancer. This vaccine is an antiidiotypic vaccine targeting N-glicolil GM3, a tumor specific antigen. The project leader was Dr Ana Mar√≠a Vazquez. These vaccine has been associated with statistically significant extension of survival of lung cancer patients with excellent safety profile and continues to be investigated in confirmatory clinical trials. Products Today CIM produces biopharmaceutical products, such as anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody for the treatment of patients with organ transplant rejection, human recombinant erythropoietin for the treatment of anemia, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor for the treatment of neutropenia, and a humanized monoclonal antibody that recognizes the epidermal growth factor receptor for cancer treatment, as well as other monoclonal antibodies for tumor imaging. Commercialization Since 1992 CIMAB S.A. has been devoted to the commercialization of biopharmaceutical products for the Cuban market and abroad, especially monoclonal antibodies and other recombinant proteins for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer and other diseases related to the immune system. CIMAB S.A. is the exclusive representative for the commercialization of the products and services of the Center of Molecular Immunology. It was announced in July 2008 that CIM had also received approval from the Cuban regulatory authorities for a lung cancer vaccine, targeting EGFR. The vaccine has been in development since 1992 and the project led by Gisela Gonzalez.

The Duke of Sutherland's Railway had opened between and (near Gartymore) on 1 November 1870. Extensions of this line southward to and northward to Helmsdale were opened on 19 June 1871. Another company, the Sutherland and Caithness Railway (S&CR;), was authorised on 13 July 1871 to take over the powers of the projected Caithness Railway and link Helmsdale with that line at , and the S&CR; opened on 28 July 1874. The station opened in 1871. The station buildings were designed by the architect William Fowler. On 29 April 1891 there was a collision between a down mixed train from Inverness which ran into an engine which had arrived earlier. Major Marindin of the Board of Trade investigated and found that the driver Robert Lindsay deliberately ignored the signals as he would have had difficulty in restarting the train on the rising gradient of 1 in 59. The station master's house on the platform was abandoned in the 1980s. In 2013 it was refitted as self-catering holiday accommodation. The station is from Inverness, and has a passing loop long, flanked by two platforms. Platform 1 on the up (southbound) line can accommodate trains having six coaches, whereas platform 2 on the down (northbound) line can hold seven.

Location The fort was constructed in 1861 as \\"Fort Massachusetts\\" and later enlarged by the Union Army and renamed \\"Fort Stevens\\" after Brig. Gen. Isaac Ingalls Stevens, who was killed at the Battle of Chantilly, Virginia, on September 1, 1862. In 1861, it had a perimeter of 168 yards and places for 10 cannon. In 1862, it was expanded to 375 yards and 19 guns. It guarded the northern approach to Washington, D.C., the Seventh Street Turnpike. By 1864 Fort Stevens was one part of a thirty-seven mile-long arrangement of fortifications, consisting of sixty-eight forts intended to defend the capital. Construction The fort was constructed as a part of a defensive ring around Washington. Following the Union defeat at Bull Run, Congress voted to augment the city's defenses, which consisted of a single fort (Fort Washington) twelve miles to the south on the Potomac. (Eventually, \\"68 forts, 93 batteries, 20 miles of rifle pits, and 32 miles of military roads surrounded the capital and Washington became the most heavily fortified city in the world.\\") In September 1861 Union troops took possession of a property owned by a free black family Elizabeth Proctor Thomas and her siblings at the Seventh Street Turnpike, seeing it as \\"an ideal and necessary location for a fort.\\" The soldiers ultimately destroyed her home, barn, orchard, and garden to build what was then named Fort Massachusetts. Elizabeth Thomas would later often repeat the story that she was watching Union soldiers with a baby in her arms weeping as they destroyed her house when \\"a tall, slender man dressed in black approached her and said, 'It is hard, but you shall reap a great reward.'\\" Many listening to her story held that the man was President Abraham Lincoln. Thomas would have to fight for compensation for damage and loss of her property and was eventually awarded $1,835 in 1916, a year before her death. Civil War District of Columbia. Detachment of Company K, 3rd Massachusetts Heavy Artillery, by guns of Fort Stevens Historical map of Washington DC area, showing forts and roads in N.E. Virginia, Drafted by U.S. War Department, 1865 After being delayed by the Battle of Monocacy, Maj. Gen. Jubal Early's Confederate forces advanced on Washington, D.C. The cavalry attacked Fort Stevens in the Battle of Fort Stevens on July 11 and July 12, 1864. They were delayed stealing horses in Damascus, Maryland, and staying overnight near Rockville, In response, Major General George Thomas ordered the District of Columbia Militia into the service of the Union army. On July 11, Confederate sharpshooters successfully shot two of the fort's soldiers, but Union soldiers pushed the Confederate soldiers back to a point from the fort. The Confederate Army used the house of a nearby resident, Francis Preston Blair, as a headquarters and a makeshift hospital for their wounded. The livestock of several nearby farmers was captured by the Confederate Army. By the evening of July 11, pedestrians lined nearby Seventh Street to watch the fighting. Secretary of State William Seward watched from a carriage. The Union Army destroyed five nearby houses in order to prevent them being occupied by Confederate sharpshooters; the Union Army allowed the homeowners to remove their furniture before destroying the houses. Despite this, Confederate sharpshooters occupied another home, of Mr. Lay, just west of the fort, and fired shots at Union soldiers from there. Union soldiers responded by firing at the cupola of the house, which caused the Confederate sharpshooters to retreat from it. The house was later burned to the ground. Confederate sharpshooters also fired from Morrison's orchard nearby. Overnight July 12, the Confederate soldiers retreated from the fort. Confederate soldiers were seen crossing the Potomac River from Poolesville, Maryland, to Virginia. They left behind 101 wounded soldiers, including 11 officers. The total number of Confederate casualties was unknown; the number of Union soldiers killed, wounded, and missing was approximately fifty in number. According to many accounts, President Abraham Lincoln rode out to the fort on both days to observe the attack, and was briefly under enemy fire by sharpshooters. On July 12, he was brusquely ordered to take cover, mostly likely by Union Maj. Gen. Horatio Wright. A story has grown up, probably apocryphal, that future Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., then an aide-de-camp to Wright, yelled at Lincoln, \\"Get down, you fool!\\"Cramer, John Henry. Lincoln Under Enemy Fire: The Complete Account of His Experiences During Early's Attack on Washington. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1948. Another story attributes this quote to nearby resident Elizabeth Thomas. This is believed to have been only the second time in American history that a sitting president came under enemy fire during a war (the first being President James Madison during the War of 1812). An article published by The Evening Star on July 13 noted, however, that \\"President Lincoln and Mrs. Lincoln passed along the line of the city defences in a carriage last night, and were warmly greeted by the soldiers wherever they made their appearance amongst them.\\" The article makes no mention of Lincoln coming under fire. Present day The site was abandoned after the war. Cass White formed the Fort Stevens Lincoln Memorial Association. A stone memorial was dedicated on November 7, 1911. In the late 1930s the Civilian Conservation Corps restored a portion of the parapet and one magazine. The site, near Georgia Avenue at 13th Street and Quackenbos Street NW, is now maintained by the National Park Service Civil War Defenses of Washington. The remains of 41 Union soldiers who died in the Battle of Fort Stevens are buried on the grounds of nearby Battleground National Cemetery. Further up Georgia Ave, a monument to seventeen unknown Confederate Soldiers was erected in Grace Episcopal Church Cemetery, in Silver Spring, MD. The seventeen soldiers, who died at Fort Stevens, are buried in that cemetery.

Works His main work is the Historia Universitatis Parisiensis covering the period from the supposed foundation of the university by Charlemagne (800) to 1600. The first three volumes published in 1665 were censured by the university. To justify himself the author wrote the Not√¶ ad censuram ... (Paris, 1667). The censors appointed by the king found nothing blameworthy in the work, and the last three volumes were published in 1673. Du Boulay's history is important on account of the many original documents which it reproduces, but its value is lessened by the poor judgment of the author.

Post-Soviet period As Azerbaijan is a secular country the 1996 law stated that foreigners have freedom of conscience, but denied the right to \\"carry out religious propaganda\\", i.e., to preach, under the threat of fines or deportation. Rafig Aliyev, head of the State Committee for Work with Religious Organisations, had declared that this ban for the foreigners to conduct religious work will be amended.

Pope John Paul II visited Azerbaijan in 2002 In 1997, a Slovak priest came to Baku to restart the Catholic community.

Pravda had worked in Siberia for many years when he became head of the mission, and noted that when he was first appointed, the church had no structure, and there were many problems with the government relating to visas, but when a new Religious affairs official was appointed, problems abated and preparations for a Papal visit gained traction. On May 23, 2002, Pope John Paul II visited the country, despite his increasingly fragile health. He was initially invited by Azerbaijan's president, Heydar Aliyev. Thanks to his visit, President Aliyev gave the Catholic Church a plot of land to build a church. The building was funded by proceeds from Pope John Paul II's book sales and foreign donations.

In the film, he is the lead guitarist of the rock band Spinal Tap. He was played by actor Christopher Guest. Character biography Nigel Tufnel was born in Squatney, East London on February 5, 1948. He was given his first guitar, a Sunburst \\"Rhythm King\\", by his father at age six. His life changed when he met David St. Hubbins (Michael McKean) who lived next door. They began jamming together in a toolshed in David's garden, influenced by (fictional) early blues artists like Honkin' Bubba Fulton, Little Sassy Francis and particularly Big Little Daddy Coleman, a deaf guitar player, and wrote their first song, \\"(Cry) All the Way Home.\\" Before long they had formed their first band, The Thamesmen. Tufnel's hobbies include collecting guitars; particularly noteworthy is his Sea Foam Green six-string Fender Bass VI with the price tag still attached, which he has kept in mint condition by not allowing it to be played, touched, pointed at, looked at, or talked about. He also has a Gibson Les Paul 1959 model, whose acoustic properties and carved flame-maple top he praises. He also plays mandolin and piano, and does backing vocals. He is currently writing a classical piece which he feels combines the musical characteristics of both Mozart and Bach (a \\"Mach piece\\") in D minor, which he claims is the \\"saddest of all keys.\\" The piece is provisionally titled \\"Lick My Love Pump'\\". According to Christopher Guest, Nigel has not yet completed the trilogy, and is still working on it. Tufnel has a great love for Gumby, carrying figurines of Gumby and Pokey in his shirt pocket and wearing Gumby shirts frequently. He is also a self-proclaimed \\"fish nut,\\" liking cod and canned tuna because they have \\"no bones.\\" Tufnel currently sits on the editorial board of his preferred in-flight periodical, Car and Driver. His favorite cookies are Oreos, but without the filling. A rider in his contract requires a large plate of Oreo halves without frosting backstage. Onstage Nigel wears glam rock-inspired makeup and usually plays a Gibson Les Paul. He is almost always seen chewing gum. Tufnel has stated that if he was not in the music industry he would like to either enter the field of haberdashery or become a surgeon. Tufnel's work outside Spinal Tap includes his appearance on the 1979 album Lenny & Squiggy present Lenny and the Squigtones, released on Casablanca Records four years before Spinal Tap.

It serves several rural hamlets in the historic county of Caithness, including Scotscalder, Olgrinmore, Westerdale and Calder. The station is situated on the Far North Line, down the line from . It has a single platform which is long enough to accommodate a four-carriage train. Owing to its geographical remoteness, limited services and lengthy journey times, Scotscalder's patronage is extremely low: the station has not seen more than 500 passengers in a year since at least the 2002‚Äì03 financial year. In 2017‚Äì18 the station only saw 182 passengers, making it the 12th least-used railway station in Britain and the least-used on the Far North Line. In 2018‚Äì19 the patronage increased to 238, making Scotscalder the second least-used station on the line (behind ) and the 15th least-used in Britain.Estimates of station usage - Office or Rail and Road The station is managed by Abellio ScotRail, which also operates all trains serving the station. History Scotscalder station in 1983 The station was opened by the Sutherland and Caithness Railway on 28 July 1874. In 1988 the station house was sold by the British Railways Board for conversion to a residential dwelling. Following the conversion, in 1994, the station house was sold again and renovated further, for which the owner won the Ian Allan Railway Heritage Award. The station house was used as a holiday home during this period, but was available to rent for short periods. It was also occasionally open to the public for viewings. Between 1994 and 2004, the owner purchased additional land to the North and South of the station house to prevent development. In 2004 the station house and surrounding land was sold again to the present owners who have carried out extensive refurbishment. The station house is now a private residence and is no longer available to rent or open to the public.

It is a prehistoric novel dealing with the interaction between Neanderthals and Cro-Magnons. A sequel, Singletusk, published in 1982, continues the story of the family. Plot Set 35,000 years ago in Scandinavia, during a thaw in the great Ice Age, the novel follows a Cro- Magnon named Tiger as he tries to defeat Shelk, a tyrant and a hybrid (Neanderthal/Cro-Magnon), the man who killed his father. With his family and much of his tribe dead, Tiger meets, interacts, and allies himself with groups of Neanderthals. He eventually marries a Neanderthal woman. Depictions Neanderthals are depicted as white-skinned, while Cro-Magnons are dark. Kurt√©n's skin color identification for both populations appears to agree with recent DNA studies, including those proposing the African origin of modern humans. His racial presentation of the Cro-Magnon is in contrast to Jean M. Auel's view in her Earth's Children series. Auel's initial book, published a few years later than Dance of the Tiger, portrayed Neanderthals as light- skinned and Cro-Magnons as more racially varied, either light or dark-skinned. The author himself says \\"The book is not intended to be a 'theory about interaction between Neanderthals and Modern Humans', it is just a fictive description of one possible scenario among several that _might_ have taken place\\". Cro-Magnon children and adults are portrayed as having smooth brows and small faces; the characteristic features of childhood act as \\"innate releasing mechanisms\\" for feelings of affection. :To the Whites, the Blacks were godlike, tall and eloquent, with a speech as varied and flexible as that of the birds. And there was something else. No White could look at the clear brow of a Black without feeling a mysterious tenderness, such as a child might evoke in the heart of his parents. (Kurt√©n, p. 33, 5th printing, paperback) Kurt√©n postulates that this attraction led to intermarriage between the two people, which produced sterile offspring. He emphasizes the possibility of Neanderthal extinction through inter-breeding rather than through violence. He also presents social differences between the two groups, presenting the Cro- Magnon people as more aggressive, practicing slavery and choosing violence to solve social problems. The Neanderthal society, based on a matriarchal system, is drawn as peace-loving with elaborate social rituals designed to resolve problems. Reception The novel is known for its plausibility and accuracy. Kurt√©n's supposition that Neanderthals and ancestors of modern Homo sapiens occupied same areas in the same time in Europe has been confirmed by fossil evidence.Twilight of the Neanderthals Article in Scientific American August 2009 by Kate Wong :Kurt√©n has managed to insinuate into his story ‚Äî in a way so subtle and natural that we can scarcely recognize he is teaching as well as novelizing ‚Äî every fact and theory that I know (and several, undoubtedly, that I don't) about Neanderthals, Cro-Magnons, human evolution during the Ice Age, glacial geology, and ecology and behavior of the great Ice Age mammals, including mammoths and saber-toothed tigers. ::::Stephen Jay Gould, introduction to Dance of the Tiger, 1980.

It serves several rural hamlets in the historic county of Caithness, including Georgemas, Roadside and Banniskirk. It is also the nearest station to the village of Halkirk, which lies approximately west of the station. Georgemas Junction is the penultimate station on the Far North Line from to , down the line from Inverness. Immediately to the west of the station lies a junction of the same name, where the branch to spurs off northwards; mileages on this branch are measured from the station. This junction is the northernmost railway junction in the United Kingdom. The station has a single platform which is long enough to accommodate a six-carriage train. History The station was built by the Sutherland and Caithness Railway (S&CR;). The station buildings were designed by Murdoch Paterson and it opened on 28 July 1874 and on that date the Highland Railway absorbed the S&CR; and operated the newly completed line from Helmsdale to Thurso and Wick. A wrought-iron turntable of diameter built by the Railway Steel and Plant Company of Manchester was installed at the station. In 1902, Donald Mackenzie, station master was appointed first station master of Dornoch railway station. From 1 January 1923 the station was operated by the London Midland and Scottish Railway. At the end of February 1937 trains were stranded at Georgemas Junction because of heavy snow. A goods train from Inverness got stuck in a drift deep. An engine with a snow plough was also stuck at the same location. The station used to have two platforms until 2012, when Direct Rail Services constructed a new freight terminal at Georgemas, which led to the removal of the former westbound platform and footbridge. This has been used by trains taking nuclear material from Dounreay to Sellafield. Facilities Facilities at this station include a payphone that accepts card and coins, a waiting room and designated seating area, a cycle rack with 10 spaces, and a free car park with 2 spaces. The nearest bus stop to the station is located to the north. Operation Georgemas Junction station in 2007, before removal of the footbridge and second platform in connection with provision of a new freight handling facility Until diesel multiple unit trains were introduced by British Rail in the early 1990s, all trains on the Far North Line were locomotive-hauled, initially by Highland Railway steam locomotives, then by LMSR steam locomotives and latterly by British Railways steam and finally Class 37 diesel locomotives. Northbound passenger trains would divide at Georgemas Junction, with the rear portion for Thurso and the front portion for Wick. A locomotive was stabled at Georgemas Junction to haul the Thurso carriages. Following the introduction of Class 156 diesel multiple units on the line, trains were always composed of two trainsets (four cars) and at Georgemas, these would split in half with the front portion heading to Wick, the rear to Thurso. This practice was halted with the introduction of Class 158 sets which operate as single sets. On arrival at Georgemas Junction from Inverness, trains reverse to reach Thurso, and then reverse again from Thurso back to Georgemas Junction (stopping a second time) and on to Wick. An easement to the National Routeing Guide allows passengers for Wick to stay on the train between Georgemas Junction and Thurso, which would otherwise technically be off-route. Georgemas Junction station has been used for several freight services. In the early 2000s, EWS operated a freight train for Safeway supermarket, running from Mossend to Georgemas. Containers were unloaded at Georgemas, then transported by road to Wick and Thurso, and by ferry to Orkney. In 2012, the former platform 1 was removed as part of a scheme to construct a new freight terminal on the site. As this platform was located on a passing loop which did not connect directly to the Thurso branch, it was very little-used by passenger trains, since all services through the station run to or from Thurso.GB eNRT May 2016 Edition, Table 239 The purpose of the passing loop dates back to the era of loco-hauled trains which divided/attached at the station an Inverness-bound train from Wick would loop around the Thurso portion standing on the second (remaining) platform, and attach to it from behind. Services On weekdays and Saturdays, there are four trains per day each way between and . After arriving at Georgemas Junction, services towards Wick reverse at the station and travel along the branch line to first, before reversing again and continuing via Georgemas Junction to Wick. Similarly, services towards Inverness first run to Thurso, reverse there and come back to Georgemas Junction before reversing again to continue to Inverness. As a result, all trains call at the station twice per journey, and the net daily service frequency is four trains per day to/from Inverness, four per day to/from Wick, and eight per day to/from Thurso. On Sundays, the frequency is reduced to one train per day each way. Since all services call twice as above, this gives one train per day to/from both Inverness and Wick, and two trains per day to/from Thurso.

Early Middle Ages  The western Balkans had been reconquered from \\"barbarians\\" by Byzantine Emperor Justinian (r. 527‚Äì565). Sclaveni (Slavs) raided the western Balkans, including Bosnia, in the 6th century. At the beginning of the 7th century first waves of Slavs had settled in Bosnia, along the Drina, Bosna and Vrbas rivers to the Adriatic coast. These were followed by Serbs and Croats who arrived in the late 620s and early 630s, invited by Emperor Heraclius to fend off an invasion by the Pannonian Avars, who had by this time settled western parts of Bosnia. By the 9th century, Bosnia was mostly Christianized by Latin priests from the Dalmatian coastal towns, though remote pockets remained unreached. Northeastern Bosnia was captured by Carolingian Franks in the early 9th century and remained under their jurisdiction until 870s. In what is now eastern Herzegovina and Montenegro, semi-independent localities emerged under Serbian rule. Peter Gojnikoviƒá annexed entire eastern Bosnia by defeating local Slavic lord Ti≈°emir of Bosnia, and pushing into Zahumlje came into conflict with Michael of Zahumlje. Croatian king Tomislav reintegrated Bosnia to roughly the same territorial extent as the Franks had held half a century earlier in the early 900s. In 949, a civil war broke out in Croatia leading to the conquest of Bosnia by ƒåaslav, but after his death in 960, it was retaken by Kresimir of Croatia. Additionally, Duklja absorbed Zahumlje under John Vladmir. In 1019 Byzantine Emperor Basil II forced the Serb and Croat rulers to acknowledge Byzantine sovereignty, though this had little impact over the governance of Bosnia. Northeastern Bosnia was given to the king of Hungary and Croatia by Ra≈°ka in 1030 as part of a dowry between Bella II and the daughter of Uro≈° I, Jelena. In 1042, the Byzantines amassed a large coalition, which included the ruler of Bosnia and the prince of Zahumlje, against the ruler of Duklja, Stefan Vojislav. Vojislav soundly defeated this coalition and went on to annex Zahumlje. Early medieval polity During this period Bosnia is already territorially and politically defined entity, governed by a ban, from at least 838 AD. The De Administrando Imperio (DAI; ca. 960) mentions Bosnia (/Bosona) as a \\"small/little land\\" (or \\"small country\\"), inhabited by Serbs along with Zahumlje and Travunija (both with territory in modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina). This is the first mention of a distinct Bosnian region. Historians have established that the medieval Bosnian polity was situated, broadly, around the Bosna river, between its upper and the middle course: in the south to north direction between the line formed by its source and the Praƒça river in the south, and the line formed by the Drinjaƒça river and the Krivaja river (from Olovo, downstream to town of Maglaj), and Vla≈°iƒá mountain in the north, and in the west to east direction between the Rama-Vrbas line stretching from the Neretva to Pliva in the west, and the Drina in the east, which is a wider area of central and eastern modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the Early Middle Ages, it is believed that what is today central and western Bosnia and Herzegovina was part of Croatia, while the rest was divided between Croatia and Serbia. High Middle Ages Relations with neighbors and consolidation Serbian princes ruled in Zahumlje, and later, after integrating with Ra≈°ka in the 1070s under Constantine Bodin, expanded to conquer all of eastern Bosnia in the 1080s. His kingdom collapsed after his death in 1102. Hungarian authority fell over Bosnia in 1102, though it was ruled through a Ban, who became more independent as the century progressed. In the 1150s, Croatian-born Ban Boriƒá led Bosnian troops to aid Hungary against the Byzantines in Belgrade. By 1180, Bosnia was functionally fully independent, though it was laid claim to by the kingdom of Hungary and Croatia. Some attempts to reunite Bosnia and Duklja were made, especially by king Koƒçopar of Duklja (1102-1103) who forged an alliance with Bosnia against Rascia and Zahumlje, but attempt utterly failed with Koƒçopar's death.Vladimir Corovic: Istorija srpskog naroda After Croatia entered a personal union with the Hungarian kingdom in 1102, most of Bosnia became vassal to Hungary as well. Since the Council at Ostrogon 1138, King Bela II of Hungary and Croatia included \\"rex Ramae\\" into his title, taking a name of a small county of Rama (central Bosnia and Herzegovina), likely referring to all of Bosnia. In 1167 Byzantium defeated Hungary at the Battle of Zemun and took all of Bosnia under its domain and would remain there until Manuel I Comnenus died in 1180. Banate With Croatia acquired by the Hungarian Kingdom, and the Serbian state in a period of stagnation, control over Bosnia was subsequently contested between the Kingdom of Hungary and the Byzantine empire. In 1154, Hungary appointed the croatian nobleman Ban Boriƒá from Slavonia as the first ruler and Viceroy of Bosnia. Under the pressure of the Byzantine, a subsequent King of Hungary appointed Kulin as a Ban to rule the province under the eastern vassalage. However, this vassalage was largely nominal. Visoko. The second Bosnian ruler, Croatian-born Ban Kulin, allegedly presided over nearly three decades of peace and stability during which he strengthened the country's economy through treaties with Dubrovnik in 1189 and Venice. His sister married the ruler of Hum, Miroslav brother of Stephan Namanja, founder of the Nemanjiƒá dynasty, with whom he also established a positive diplomatic relationship. However, he had poor relations with Hungary and her ally Zeta for religiopolitical reasons. His rule also marked the start of a controversy with the Bosnian Church, an indigenous Christian sect considered heretical by both the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches. In response to Hungarian attempts to use church politics regarding the issue as a way to reclaim sovereignty over Bosnia, Kulin held a council of local church leaders to renounce the heresy in 1203. Despite this, Hungarian ambitions remained unchanged long after Kulin's death in 1204, waning only after an unsuccessful invasion in 1254. Minoslav died in 1198 and Andrew, brother of the King of Hungary and appointed by him to be duke of Croatia and Dalmatia as well as Hum, jumped at the opportunity. He took northwestern Hum after defeating a local force but he withdrew in 1203 either because his brother, King Irme, declared war on him or he was pushed out by Peter. Peter was chosen by the local nobles of Hum to succeed Miroslav and was likely his son. He soon ousted a brother named Andrew from Eastern Hum, but Stefan the First-Crowned sided with the exiled Andrew and returned Hum to the Neretva in 1216, and Andrew became a puppet prince of Hum. He was later removed by Stefan and replaced by a governor, possibly his son, Stefan Radoslav. This meant Andrew only had Popovo and the coastline remaining, and by 1218, Peter had taken it and Andrew had disappeared. The Pope called for Hungary to crusade against heretics in Bosnia in 1225, and the call was met a decade later. It is likely that Hungary was putting political pressure on the papacy to invade Bosnia for territorial gain, as there is no concrete proof of Bosnian heresy at this time, just ignorance of certain catholic practices. Hungary invaded starting in 1235 and reached Bosnia in 1238, when they captured Vrhbosna. In 1241 they retreated back to Hungary when it came under threat of the Tartars. The commander of the crusaders, Koloman, brother of the king, was slaughtered by the Tartars along with his army at Saj√≥ river on April 11, 1241, thus allowing the Bosnian Ban, prince of Split Matej Ninoslav to regain control of all Bosnia. With the death of the Great Khan, the Tartars returned to Karakorum, pillaging along the way. They circumnavigated Bosnia, so its leaders had time to reassert power without interference or outside threat. Territorial evolution of the Bosnian Kingdom Late Middle Ages Kingdom of Bosnia In the 1280s a minor noble from northern Bosnia named Stephan Kotroman married the daughter of Stefan Dragutin, son-in-law to the King of Hungary. The ruler of Maƒçva gained control of northern Bosnia, under the supervision of the croatian ≈†ubiƒá family who were eventually ousted from power during a war with Venice over the town of Zadar. His son, Stjepan II Kotromaniƒá became Ban of Bosnia in 1322. He took parts of Croatia and the Dalmatian coast between his ascension and 1326, when he annexed Hum. He signed peace treaties with Ragusa in 1334 and Venice in 1335. He died in 1353 and his nephew, Stephen Tvrtko, succeeded him at age 15. Stjepan II had not properly consolidated his banate, so when he died, his state fractured as the nobles felt no obligation to young Tvrtko I. Just before Kotromaniƒá died, he had married his daughter, Elizabeth, to Louis, King of Hungary, which gave Louis the excuse to demand the rich lands of Hum from Tvrtko. Having no real support from his nobles, Tvrtko submitted to the King's demands and in 1357, Hungary regained its territory in Hum. In 1363, war broke out between the two kings. Louis invaded the northern provinces, which were divided in loyalty between the two kings. An ally of Tvrtko, Vlkac Hrvatiniƒá defended Sokograd and a month later, repelled a second invasion at Srebrnik in Usora. In 1366, his nobles expelled him and Tvrtko fled to the court of Hungary, which surprisingly accepted him. The revolting nobles plopped Tvrtko's brother, Vuk, on the throne. Tvrtko was soon back in Bosnia with troops from Hungary to take back his realm, and by the end of the year Vuk was exiled and Tvrtko was back on the throne. After the death of Stefan Du≈°an and the collapse of his Serbian empire, competing factions tried to carve their own chunks of territory from it. Lazar Hrebljanoviƒá received troops from Tvrtko, and thus gave some of the spoils and land to him. In 1377 Tvrtko I crowned himself King of Bosnia. In 1388 an Ottoman raiding party was wiped out in Hum by a local noble named Vlatko Vukoviƒá, who was later sent along with a Bosnian army to help Lazar at the Battle of Kosovo Polje. After Tvrtko's death in 1391, the kingship was severely weakened by local nobles vying for power, though the kingdom did not splinter. In 1404 King Ostoja was ousted by the nobles and replaced by the illegitimate son of Tvrtko, Tvrtko II. Ostoja returned with a Hungarian army and retook part of the country, and for ten years slowly regained authority in Bosnia. In 1414 the Ottomans declared the ousted Tvrtko II the rightful king of Bosnia and invaded. A year later, the Ottomans won a decisive battle against the Hungarian and Bosnian forces under Ostoja with the aid of a powerful Bosnian nobleman called Hrvoje. They agreed to keep Ostoja on the throne, but the king of Bosnia would never again be outside of the Turkish sphere of influence. In 1418 Ostoja died and his son was exiled two years later by Tvrtko II. War over the mining district of Srebrenica. Between 1433 and 1435 southern parts of central Bosnia was taken from the Hungarians by the Turks with the help of Stephen Vulkƒçiƒá, Sandalj's nephew and lord of Hum. Turks seized Srebrenica in 1440. Tvrkto II died in 1443. 3 year civil war between Sephen Vulkƒçiƒá and Tvrkto II's successor, Stephen Toma≈°. War ended when they came to an agreement but Vulkƒçiƒá still supported the Serbian ruler George Brancoviƒá, a semi independent vassal of the Ottoman Turks who was contesting the Bosnian king for Srebrenica. In the early 1450s Vulkƒçiƒá became embroiled in a civil war with Ragusa and his eldest son. 1461, Toma≈° died and his son Stephan Toma≈°eviƒá ascended to the throne. He quickly asked Pope Pius II for help, and again in 1463 against the looming threat of Ottoman invasion. No help came, and Mehmet the Conqueror's invading army took the stronghold of Bobovac. Stephan Toma≈°eviƒá fled north to Jajce and then to the nearby fortress of Kljuƒç where he was besieged, captured, and beheaded. The main Ottoman army withdrew in the fall of that year, only leaving scant garrisons to guard what they had conquered. King Matthias of Hungary then invaded and took parts of northern and northwestern Bosnia by besieging and taking both Jajce and the nearby fortress of Zveƒçaj. Matthias created a Bannate loyal to him and renamed the Ban, King of Bosnia in 1471. The kingdom's territory was soon smashed to almost nothing by the returning Turks. In 1526, the Turks obliterated the Hungarians at the Battle of Moh√°cs and year later took Jajce, finally crushing the last hold out of Hungary in Bosnia. Vulkƒçiƒá reclaimed his kingdom after the Turks withdrew, but lost it again two years later, staking out in the port town of Novi, where he died in 1466. He was succeeded by his son Vlatko who tried to gain help from Venice and Hungary but to no avail. The last fortress in Hum was taken in 1482.

It is in length and runs from CR 353 in Rensselaerville to Interstate 90 (I-90) exit 4 in Albany. It also has a loop route, NY 85A, which connects NY 85 to the village of Voorheesville. The portion of NY 85 north of NY 140 to the Bethlehem‚ÄìAlbany town/city line is known as the Slingerlands Bypass. From there north to I-90, the road is a limited-access, four-lane highway named the Crosstown Arterial. Route description NY 85 at the Ten Mile Creek Bridge in Rensselaerville, approaching its western terminus NY 85 begins at the north end of the County Route 353 (CR 353; Delaware Turnpike) bridge over the Ten Mile Creek in the hamlet of Rensselaerville. In the center of the hamlet, NY 85 turns north at the intersection with CR 351 (Medusa Road), NY 85 proceeds northward along Delaware Turnpike, a two-lane residential road through the town of Rensselaerville. The route soon becomes a woods road, turning east and passing the southern terminus of CR 6\\\\. NY 85 bends northeast through Rensselaerville, crossing through valleys until Stevens Road, where it bends southeast and soon east into the town of Westerlo. Still known as Delaware Turnpike, NY 85 continues east through the valleys past a junction with CR 408. East of CR 408, NY 85 winds south of Onderdonk Lake, soon crossing a junction with CR 1 (Switzkill Road). Bending northward through Westerlo, NY 85 remains a two-lane rural road, soon reaching a junction with the western terminus of NY 143\\\\. NY 85 continues northeast from NY 143, becoming more residential as it approaches a junction with CR 14 (Joslyn School Road). Crossing into the town of Berne, NY 85 meets a junction with CR 11 (Cass Hill Road) west of the hamlet of Reidsville. The route then bends northward at this junction, bypassing the hamlet and soon reaching the northern terminus of CR 11 (North Road) nearby. After CR 11, NY 85 continues northward through Berne, bending northeast into a junction with NY 443 (Helderberg Trail). NY 443 and NY 85 become concurrent, proceeding eastward and south of Helderberg Lake as Delaware Turnpike. NY 85 and NY 443 continue winding eastward, crossing into the town of New Scotland, crossing through the Letter-S, a hill named for a former S-bend alignment of Route 85 that is preserved in two town roads of similar names. Climbing down the hill, the routes bend southward, reaching a junction with New Scotland Road. At this junction, NY 443 continues southeast on Delaware Turnpike while NY 85 turns east on New Scotland. Still a two-lane road through New Scotland, NY 85 passes multiple residences before making a large curve to the north. NY 85 at NY 443 in New Scotland The route bends northeast and enters the area of New Salem Hill, where it intersects with the eastern terminus of NY 157 (Thacher Park Road). Continuing north, NY 85 soon bends southeast and enters the hamlet of New Salem, where it intersects with the western terminus of NY 85A (New Salem Road). Through New Salem, NY 85 is a two-lane residential street, soon leaving the hamlet after Mountain View Estates Road. Running northeast through New Scotland, NY 85 remains a two-lane residential road, crossing under CSX railroad tracks before reaching the hamlet of New Scotland. The route runs northeast through the hamlet, becoming a two-lane residential and commercial mix and intersects with CR 308 (New Scotland South Road). NY 85 quickly crosses the eastern terminus of NY 85A (Maple Road), bending southeast through New Scotland. Leaving the namesake hamlet, NY 85 continues southeast until reaching the town of Bethlehem. Through Bethlehem, NY 85 reaches the hamlet of Slingerlands, becoming a two-lane residential street and crossing the eastern terminus of CR 306 (Font Grove Road). Passing a junction with Kenwood Avenue, NY 85 crosses through the commercial center of Slingerlands, soon turning northeast into another residential portion of Slingerlands. Near the northern end of the hamlet, the route enters a roundabout with NY 140 (Cherry Avenue Extension) and New Scotland Road (NY 910E). NY 85 turns northwest at the roundabout, bending into another one with Vista Boulevard. Continuing northeast, NY 85 reaches a third roundabout with Maher Road (NY 915L), which connects to New Scotland Road and the hamlet of Karlsfeld. After crossing another roundabout, this time with Blessing Road, NY 85 crosses through the Normanskill section of Bethlehem, crossing over the New York State Thruway (I-87). Just after the overpass, NY 85 widens from a two lane road to a four lane divided controlled-access highway, crossing into the city of Albany and passing a ramp for Krumkill Road. Crossing over Buckingham Road, NY 85 interchanges with the local street, soon reaching an interchange with Cortland Street, which connects to US 20 (Western Avenue). Almost immediately after US 20, NY 85 continues past another interchange, serving Washington Avenue and the W. Averell Harriman State Office Building Campus. Just north of this interchange, Route 85 ends at trumpet interchange with I-90. History Origins View of the tollgate in Slingerlands. It was demolished in 1908. The path of modern NY 85 west of Slingerlands roughly follows that of the Albany, Rensselaerville, and Schoharie Plank Road, a plank road established to connect the city of Albany with the town of Schoharie by way of passing through Rensselaerville. The Albany, Schoharie, and Rensselaerville Plank Road Company was organized on October 10, 1849, with Lansing Pruyn as president. On March 25, 1850, the company was given a 30-year charter; and the road from Lydius Street in Albany (today Madison Avenue) to the hamlet of New Salem‚Äînow New Scotland Avenue in the city of Albany and New Scotland Road in Bethlehem and New Scotland‚Äîand the portion of the road from Bernville to Gallupville were planked with wooden boards. Portions of the plank road were already long established roads, such as the Beaverdam (or Beaver Dam) Road in western Albany County near New Salem, which had already existed for quite some time prior to moving to an easier grade around New Salem in 1806. The plank road/turnpike spurred the development of many places along its path, such as a hotel at what would evolve into the hamlet of Hurstville and a post office at what would become the hamlet of Slingerlands. In 1854 the state authorized the fiscally unsound plank road company to abandon or sell portions of the road and to turn other sections into a turnpike and charge tolls. The section from New Salem east to the hamlet of New Scotland subsequently had its planks removed and the portion from Bernville to Gallupville was also abandoned. In 1881 the charter was renewed for another 30 years. In 1896 the turnpike company opposed the construction of a railroad that would have been in direct competition to the turnpike from Albany to Schoharie. Designation In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route 7, an unsigned legislative route extending from Binghamton to Albany via Oneonta and Schoharie. Route 7 entered the town of New Scotland on what is now NY 157 and followed it to its eastern end at modern NY 85\\\\. At this point, the route turned onto the old Albany‚ÄìSchoharie plank road and continued east to Albany on New Scotland Road and New Scotland Avenue. The section of legislative Route 7 east of modern NY 157 was not assigned a posted designation until the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York when it became part of NY 85, which initially extended from NY 81 in the hamlet of Oak Hill in the town of Durham to US 20 in Albany.Automobile Legal Association (ALA) Automobile Green Book, 1930‚Äì31 and 1931‚Äì32 editions, (Scarborough Motor Guide Co., Boston, 1930 and 1931). The 1930‚Äì31 edition shows New York state routes prior to the 1930 renumbering When it was first assigned, the route followed Makley and Siebert Roads north from Oak Hill to Medusa, then continued northeast to Westerlo on CR 351, CR 402, CR 404, and CR 401\\\\. Past Westerlo, NY 85 was routed on what is now NY 143 to the Delaware Turnpike near Reidsville, where it joined its current alignment. Northeast of Slingerlands, NY 85 followed New Scotland Avenue into downtown Albany, where it terminated at US 20. The portion of the route between Medusa and Reidsville was realigned to serve the hamlet of Rensselaerville. Instead of heading east from Medusa, NY 85 was rerouted to follow CR 352, CR 360, CR 359, and CR 353 north to Rensselaerville, where it met its modern routing. NY 85 was truncated to Rensselaerville . Construction on the Slingerlands Bypass, a new highway bypassing the hamlet of Slingerlands, began in the early 1960s. The first section of the bypass from Washington Avenue to Buckingham Drive (the Krumkill Road exit) was completed by 1964. The remainder of the highway was open by 1968 as a realignment of NY 85. Between Blessing Road and the Albany city line, the bypass was constructed as a two-lane highway. This section was originally planned to be four lanes wide as well, but was constructed with only two lanes due to community activism by an anti-sprawl group known as the Bethlehem Lincoln Republicans in the early 1960s. The old alignment of NY 85 along New Scotland Road from where NY 85 turns onto the bypass to the Albany city line (a distance of as of 2008) is now designated as NY 910E, an unsigned reference route. A four-lane extension of the bypass was constructed in 2007 between NY 140 and Maher Road. Four roundabouts were built, the southernmost where NY 85 currently meets NY 140 at Cherry Avenue Extension. After the roadway opened to traffic on November 7, 2007, NY 85 was rerouted onto the newly constructed portion of the bypass while the section of New Scotland Road between NY 140 and Maher Road became part of an extended NY 910E. The new highway, four lanes divided, meets the existing highway portion of the bypass at the same Maher Road (NY 915L), at the third roundabout. NY 85 was once proposed to be extended to the unbuilt I-687. Major intersections Suffixed Route right NY 85A () is an alternate route of NY 85 in New Scotland, accessing Voorheesville.

Their name is a portmanteau of \\"ska\\" and \\"Mephistopheles\\", of the Faust legend. As their name suggests, their lyrics are often playfully satanic in nature. Career 1990‚Äì1994: Formation and early years The band began when New York hardcore band The Shaved Pigs split up, and guitarist Brendan Tween and his roommate Mikal Reich, both residents of New York City's East Village, decided to start a ska band. After recruiting several friends, including keyboardist Brian \\"Underpants\\" Martin, the band was formed under the name Skatterbrains. It was changed to Mephiskapheles once the band realized that another band had already taken the name. On January 3, 1991, the band played its first show at Yugo's, a bar in Valley Stream, Long Island. After a lineup shuffle that saw Andre A. Worrell (as The Nubian Nightmare) emerge as lead singer and frontman, the band recorded its demo tape titled The DEMOn. In summer 1991, trombonist Greg Robinson joined alto saxophonist Alexander McCabe and trumpeter Osho Endo in the horn section, completing the section that would tour and record for the next six years. The band continued to play live, winning the Brooklyn Lager Band Search in the World Beat category in 1992 and building a devoted fan base throughout the Northeast by performing frequently at colleges and bars. In 1993, bass player Michael Bitz joined, replacing Vattel Cherry, who had taken over from original bassist Victor Rice soon after Mephiskapheles got started, in early 1991. Cherry left to tour with avant-garde saxophonist Charles Gayle. In late 1994, Mephiskapheles released its debut album, God Bless Satan, produced by Bill Laswell and Robert Musso. Originally released on the band's own label Pass The Virgin, it saw wider release after being licensed by Moon Ska Records for national distribution starting in 1995. A video the band produced for the song \\"Doomsday\\" began receiving airplay on MTV around this time. Earlier, in its demo form, the song had been widely heard on television in New York as the soundtrack to a fitness-center commercial. Mephiskapheles was among the bands that regularly attracted capacity crowds to Wetlands during the New York City nightclub's golden era in the mid-1990s. Other New York City clubs where Mephiskapheles headlined during its 1990s rise included S.O.B.'s, New Frontier, New Music Caf√©, The Cooler, Tramps, Palladium, Bond Street, Cat Club, Lone Star Caf√©, Don Hill's, West End Gate, Pyramid Club, Kenny's Castaways, Caf√© Wha?, Nightengales, and Tilt. 1995‚Äì2001: Tours and break-up After completing its first cross-country tour in 1995, Mephiskapheles toured extensively through the U.S. and Europe in 1996, including a triumphant trip to Honolulu, Hawaii to celebrate a string of three hit singles on the Hawaiian Island Charts: \\"Doomsday,\\" \\"Saba,\\" and \\"Bumble Bee Tuna.\\" Mephiskapheles began playing frequent shows with the Blue Meanies, from Chicago, and Inspecter 7, from New Brunswick, New Jersey, during this time. Soon after Mephiskapheles' first European tour, in late 1996, drummer and creative force in the early phase, Mikal Reich, left the band to pursue a career outside of music. He was replaced by Wayne Dunton who recorded on the band's 1997 album, Maximum Perversion, and all subsequent releases. With support from Moon Ska Records, a video was filmed for the track \\"Break Your Ankle Punk\\" which featured hip-hop DJ Lyvio G. As the band's profile continued to rise, the band embarked on a national tour with British pop-punk icons the Buzzcocks in the spring of 1997. McCabe, one of Mephiskapheles' main composers during the fertile mid-1990s period, had ceased touring with the band prior to the recording of Maximum Perversion, the band on the road opting for a two- piece section with Endo and Robinson. However, McCabe, Endo, and Robinson were reunited when they recorded on Moby's version of John Barry's \\"James Bond Theme\\" for the soundtrack of the film Tomorrow Never Dies. In its various remixes, \\"James Bond Theme (Moby's Re-Version)\\" became a hit in several countries, and was included on Moby's greatest-hits albums I Like to Score and Go - The Very Best of Moby. In late 1998, Mephiskapheles shocked some fans' sensibilities when they toured the U.S. opening for heavy-metal shock rockers Gwar. By 1999, the band had gone through a major lineup change with Tween, Bitz, and Endo all leaving the band, for various reasons. New members, bassist Dan Jeselsohn, guitarists Bill McKinney and Dave Hahn and saxophonist Ian Hendrickson-Smith were brought in to record an album, Might-Ay White-Ay, that fused reggae, hardcore, and metal with some straight-ahead ska included. Longtime Skatalites trumpeter Nathan Breedlove played on the album, but he did not tour with Mephiskapheles. After continuing to play live performances for two more years, the band stopped playing shows without any official announcement of a breakup. After Mephiskapheles, Worrell, McKinney, Robinson, and Bitz played in the band Skull-A-Ball. Robinson played guitar in this project. The band self-released three songs on CD and played several shows before disbanding. Worrell also appeared with Bitz and Jeselsohn in the band Burn Guitars. The band featured three bass players, a drummer, and no guitars. This band also played numerous shows but disbanded after recording one demo. A third band, named Tirade, spun off from Mephiskapheles and featured McKinney, Jeselsohn, and future Joan Jett drummer Michael McDermott, performing more heavy metal-based material. This band also recorded one demo. 2012‚Äìpresent: Reformation In spring of 2012, Tween and Worrell led separate Mephiskapheles reunion shows. Worrell's lineup resurrected the 8 Iron Men-era band of 2000-01, and consisted of Worrell, Dunton, Hahn, McKinney, Jeselsohn, and Robinson, plus saxophonists Bourbon Zeigler Jr., who had toured with Mephiskapheles in the late 1990s, and Neil Johnson, who the band knew from his having been a member of The Planet Smashers and The Toasters. Tween's group, Doomsday: The Ultimate Mephiskapheles Tribute, boasted a lineup of Tween, Reich, Jeselsohn, Endo, Robinson, and McCabe, plus keyboardist Jerica Rosenblum, and performed one night in April 2012, thrilling the small crowd in an Upper West Side bar with a recital of Mephiskapheles classics. Subsequent \\"Doomsday\\" shows have included Tween, Reich, and Rosenblum with new members, and have featured other music besides Mephiskapheles songs. Since regrouping, Mephiskapheles has continued to stay active both on tour and in the studio. Notable appearances in 2013 included featured sets at the Apple Stomp ska festival in New York and at Riot Fest in Chicago, where the band preceded T.S.O.L., Rancid, and Blink-182 on the Riot Stage. Bassist Michael Bitz returned to the band in 2013, replacing Jeselsohn who left to focus on the Brooklyn Attractors, a band he cofounded with members of Westbound Train. Guitarist Bill McKinney also departed the band in 2013, going on to found The West Kensingtons, a Philadelphia-based ska band with former members of Inspecter 7. Mephiskapheles rounded out an eventful year with gigs in support of the Mighty Mighty Bosstones and the Bouncing Souls, in addition to being the headliner for several shows. In late 2013, founding keyboardist Brian Martin rejoined Mephiskapheles. The band played in Honolulu in February 2014 and also made tours through the Southeast and Midwest. Mephiskapheles entered the recording studio in mid-2014 to begin recording its fourth album, a self- titled EP featuring music composed by Hahn, Bitz, Worrell, and Robinson, with lyrics by Worrell. The band was joined in the studio and subsequently onstage by former Burning Spear trumpet player James K. Smith. Highlights of 2014 also included a sold-out show at Irving Plaza with British punk band the Anti- Nowhere League and the Cro-Mags. Mephiskapheles finished 2014 with a holiday tour supporting the Slackers. Mephiskapheles played several Northeast dates in early 2015 before travelling to Denver, Colorado to perform along with Hepcat at Skalorado Fest. In April 2015, Mephiskapheles recorded two new songs as part of the Converse Rubber Tracks project, at Rubber Tracks studio in Brooklyn. In June, Mephiskapheles released its eponymous EP, the first new Mephiskapheles music in 16 years, on Meph Records, in 12-inch vinyl and online digital formats. The EP was produced by Mephiskapheles, mixed by Gabe Kirchheimer, and mastered by Stephen Egerton, and can be downloaded from the band's Bandcamp page. Mephiskapheles also made successful headlining tours to the Midwest and Florida, in 2015, as well as hosting its annual Devil's Night party (i.e., the night before Halloween) at the Mercury Lounge in New York. A handful of shows supporting the Voodoo Glow Skulls filled out a busy and productive year. Saxophonists Neil Johnson and Bourbon Zeigler had both left the band by early 2016, clearing the way for their longtime sub, tenor saxophonist Fernando Leon to join. Leon also played on the band's 2015 EP but was not credited. Mephiskapheles continued to share the stage with established punk and ska-punk bands in 2016, making separate East Coast runs with Less Than Jake and NOFX in the early part of the year. After Meph Records released a promotional video for the song \\"Friends Like You\\", in April, the band announced work was ongoing on another video, for the song \\"Satan Stole My Weed\\". Returning from a well-received tour of Texas, in May, Mephiskapheles headlined in Asbury Park, New Jersey as part of the Punk Rock Bowling & Music festival in June 2016. Later that month, Mephiskapheles traveled to Montreal and played in support of legendary British glam rockers The Adicts at the official after-party for the Amnesia Rockfest. After a frantic five years of activity since regrouping, Mephiskapheles slowed the pace slightly in 2017, playing several shows, occasionally venturing off the Atlantic seaboard such as to play a series of shows in the Midwest with Mustard Plug. God Bless Satan was released in a limited edition on cassette for Cassette Store Day by Jump Up in September. The sixth annual Mephiskapheles Devil's Night Danse was held in late October in two locations, at the Wonder Bar in Asbury Park and the Bowery Electric in New York. Jump Up released a 20th-anniversary colored vinyl LP edition of Maximum Perversion to mark the occasion. In November, Mephiskapheles made its first-ever tour to Central America, playing successful shows in Guatemala City, Guatemala and Santa Tecla, El Salvador.

Between features a repeated lyrical motif in an effort to unify the body of work as a whole. Background The Receiving End of Sirens formed in 2003 by bassist Brendan Brown and guitarist Alex Bars during the pair's first year of college, out of the demise of their band Settle for Nothing. Following two months of writing, they brought in guitarist Nate Patterson, drummer Andrew Cook and vocalist Ben Potrykus. They played their first show in March that year and by August, embarked on a brief tour with Hidden in Plain View. As the band was building in popularity, Brown, Bars and Cook dropped their studies to focus on the band full-time. They spent September writing material for their debut album, which they aimed to release in early 2004. The band played a few shows in October and November, prior to the departure of Potrykus on November 24. At this point, they had been three months into discussing contract details with major label Atlantic Records. They subsequently spent time writing new songs and searching for a new frontman; Casey Crescenzo joined the group in January 2004. In March, the group shifted their line-up, with Brown, Bars and Crescnezo all sharing vocal duties. They self-released a self-titled EP later in the year, which drew the attention of independent label Triple Crown Records, who promptly signed the band in early October. The band began recording their debut in mid-October. The studio the band worked was connected to a larger room with an orchestra in it. Crescnezo used a microphone and bootlegged what they were playing. He cut up the audio and turned the clips into samples that were added to the album. Composition Overview Between the Heart and the Synapse has been described as a post-hardcore release, incorporating elements of punk rock, metal, progressive rock and electronica, and earning comparisons to Coheed and Cambria, Tool, The Artist in the Ambulance (2003)-era Thrice, Refused and the Mars Volta. The band avoid the verse-chorus-verse for the most part, instead opting for free form structures, with the exception of \\"Planning a Prison Break\\". The group balanced three-part harmonies with their three different vocalists Brendan Brown (who also plays bass), Alex Bars (who also plays guitar) and Casey Crescenzo (who also plays guitar, keyboards, piano), despite Brown and Bars having similar voices, as well as three-part guitar riffs from Crescenzo, Bars and guitarist Nate Patterson. The group also incorporated programming, vocal manipulation and programmed drums. Clips of ambient electronic sounds are heard throughout the album; similarly Crescenzo uses screaming throughout the record as well. The album's title ‚Äì Between the Heart and the Synapse ‚Äì is taken from a line in \\"This Armistice\\". Brown said the record is about a battle with the mind and the, and the ideal representation of one's self and one's actual self. Most of the lyrics were written by Brown and Crescenzo, with some help from Cook; they use wordplay and small instances of alliteration, tackling the themes of love, prison break, war, masturbation, the departure of the group's former frontman, and the tale of Romeo and Juliet. Tracks \\"Planning a Prison Break\\" sees Crescenzo singing the verse sections, with Brown handling the first chorus, and Bars the second. All three sing the refrain \\"This is the last night in my body\\" which is used as a motif during the chorus of the album. Brown explained the line was about being \\"unsatisfied with how I am living and vowing to my self to never just settle or accept the way I am living.\\" The song, along with parts of \\"This Armistice\\", was written when Potrykus was in the band, and subsequently re-worked on with Crescenzo. \\"The Rival Cycle\\" utilized the electronic sounds following a breakdown partway through the track. It features two different chorus sections being sung at once. The pop punk-indebted \\"The Evidence\\" is followed by \\"The War of All Against All\\". It opens with a tribal drum pattern, eventually shifting to a chorus section of changing rhythms and later on, crescendo to its end. \\"The War of All Against All\\" segues into \\"...Then I Defy You, Stars\\" with its guitar octaves, slow-tempo percussion backing vocals. It is followed by the piano-driven slow-building track \\"Intermission\\" and the hard rock number \\"This Armistice\\". \\"Broadcast Quality\\" uses pop punk melodies, before shifting into a breakdown, and ending with a choral-esque vocal performance. The up-tempo piano track \\"Flee the Factory\\" ends with a jazz-esque interlude that segues into the opening synthesizers of \\"Dead Men Tell No Tales\\". The band wrote it about Potrykus; Brown said after he had left, they were \\"all really scared and felt as though we had dropped everything for this and now it was gone\\". The penultimate song \\"Venona\\" was compared to Thrice, and is followed by the 13-minute closing post-rock track \\"Epilogue\\", which features a hidden track. Release In January and February 2005, the group toured the US with As Tall as Lions and Cartel. Between the Heart and the Synapse was released on April 26, though independent label Triple Crown Records. It was promoted with a two- month US headlining tour and an appearance at Flipside festival. They went on a three-week stint in May and June with Gatsbys American Dream and the Rocket Summer, leading up to two shows on the Warped Tour. They filmed a video for \\"Planning a Prinson Break\\", and continued on Warped until mid-August. Following this, the group joined Acceptance, Cartel and Panic! at the Disco on the Take Cover tour in September and October. On September 20, the \\"Planning a Prison Break\\" music video was posted online. In November, the group toured with Alexisonfire, and later played a few shows with Saves the Day and Senses Fail. In February 2006, a music video was filmed for \\"This Armistice\\" in Somers, Connecticut with Crescenzo serving as the director. Brown called his former school principal, who in turn contacted the Recreation Department to get permission to film there. Following this, the group performed on the 2006 Taste of Chaos tour in February and March. Bars fell down a flight of stairs in May, resulting in a stay at the emergency room; the group continued touring in spite of this. Between March and May, the band went on a headlining tour of the US, with support from A Thorn for Every Heart, As Tall as Lions, the Blackout Pact, Yesterdays Rising, My American Heart, I Am the Avalanche and Hit the Lights. During April, the \\"This Armistice\\" video debuted on MTV2 and MTVu. The clip featured students and Matt Herzog, formerly of Overlook, which previously featured Brown and Bars. It stars Adrian Amodeo, the group's manager, going through several doorways, before landing at the last one. He then finds himself watching the band performing for some people. In early May 2006, they performed at The Bamboozle festival. On May 21, the band announced that Crescenzo had left, citing \\"many factors, personal and creative\\" as the reasoning; he was temporarily replaced by Ross. Brown and Bars handled vocal duties for the remainder of the year. In June, the band supported Boys Night Out on their headlining Canadian tour. Between June and August, the group supported Circa Survive on their US headlining tour. Following this, they toured the UK with Fightstar. The band performed on the MTV2 Dollar Bill Tour in October and November. Cody Bonnette of As Cities Burn filled Crescenzo's role for three months, before he was replaced by Brian Southall of Boys Night Out, who was previously the group's one-time touring manager. A music video was released for \\"The Evidence\\" on January 22, 2007. The album was pressed on vinyl in 2010 with a bonus track \\"Weightless Underwater\\". This edition featured new artwork from Matt Adams, who said he had made it after being inspired by the original in college. Reception Between the Heart and the Synapse received mixed-to-positive reviews from music critics. Sputnikmusic staff member Rowan5215 found it hard to \\"nail down just what makes [it] such a goddamn great record.\\" He praised the \\"amazingly co-ordinated and fierce\\" three-part vocals, with each member \\"shining in their own respective rights\\", while \\"working as a flawless part of the team\\". AllMusic reviewer Bret Love said it was a \\"pretty rare thing\\" to discover an act who had an original sound; the resulting mixture of various genres created \\"an engaging aural assault that is uniquely their own.\\" He complimented Squire for doing an \\"impressive job of capturing\\" the band's three-part guitar work in a \\"crisp, clean mix that ensures not a single detail goes unnoticed.\\" IGN's JR said the band were \\"invested with a capacity for intriguing songwriting and an undeniable musicianship ... The music itself defies comprehensive description\\" He also astounded by the varying mix of genres: \\"the sound is too ethereal, too uniquely nuanced.\\" Punknews.org staff member Brian Shultz considered its length \\"a tad overambitious for a debut\\", though the band were able \\"to keep your attention intact for the disc's duration.\\" He enjoyed hearing an act that \\"actually properly utiliz[es] a three-guitar attack\\", and summarized the album as a \\"mildly enjoyable and an impressive debut\\" displaying a \\"ton of potential and likewise developing talent.\\" Kaj Roth of Melodic said the group simply followed trends and performed \\"what a thousand other bands does today\\", adding \\"nothing new to the genre\\". He mentioned that if the listener was \\"already tired\\" of this kind of music, \\"don't bother to look this way.\\" He criticized the album's length: \\"70 minutes is way too long for any emo band,I just can¬¥t take his tense vocals more than 45 mins.\\" Track listing All songs are written by Andrew Cook, Alex Bars, Brendan Brown, Casey Crescenzo, Nate Patterson.

Millennium Park connects four of the major cities in the area together, including Grand Rapids, Wyoming, Grandville, and Walker. When completed, the park will be twice as large as New York City's Central Park, at approximately 1,500 acres (6 km¬≤). The project began in 1998 when the Parks Department director Roger Sabine began planning for an expansion of Johnson Park. Sabine expanded the Johnson Park expansion into the 1,500 acre (6 km¬≤) park project. The project was finally submitted to the Secchia Millennium Commission (SMC) later that year and later approved the project by which the Kent County Board of Commissioners named the park Millennium Park. The park celebrated its grand opening in July 2004. The park is built on the former location of gypsum mines and gravel pits, including the former location of the Domtar mine. About 50 pumps continue to extract petroleum in locations across the parkland. Park features *Beach and splashpad *Boardwalk *Boating center *Fishing dock *Picnic shelters *Trails Recreational fishing The park offers a unique fishing experience in an urban community. With a very short commute from downtown Grand Rapids, fishermen are able to enjoy a plethora of fishing locations and many off- season parking lots, which are free of charge. The lakes are home to a variety of panfish, both large and smallmouth bass, and even the occasional northern pike. The park offers boat rentals in the summer that can help fishermen reach their desired trophy fish. With very few visitors in the early spring,the area is a delicacy for anglers during the most ideal season to seek out largemouth bass. It is important to note that the DNR will often stop by to ensure that participants have purchased proper licenses. Additionally, for the health and safety of both the park and its visitors, everyone is encouraged to keep a safe distance from the native swan and goose populations. Norovirus outbreak In July 2010, more than 120 visitors contracted norovirus. An epidemiologist stated the most likely cause was that someone who was sick with the virus brought it into the park environment. Tests by the Kent County Health Department confirmed that norovirus was the causative agent.

It serves the town of Thurso and its surrounding areas in the historic county of Caithness. It is also the nearest station to the port of Scrabster (about to the northwest), which has ferry services linking the mainland with Stromness on the Orkney Islands. It is the northernmost station on the National Rail network. The station is situated at the end of a short branch line off the Far North Line. It is down the line from (the other end of the branch), and from . Thurso station is managed by Abellio ScotRail, which also operates all trains serving the station. History The station opened on 28 July 1874. A wrought-iron turntable, in diameter, was built at the station by the Railway Steel and Plant Company of Manchester. The station was threatened with closure in the 1960s under the Beeching Axe. Until 2000, trains from would split in half at , with one portion going to and the other to Thurso. In the age of locomotive- hauled trains prior to the introduction of diesel multiple units by British Rail, a locomotive was based at Georgemas Junction to take the Thurso portion to and from the junction. The practice of splitting trains ended when s were introduced on the line since then all services run in full between Inverness and Wick via Thurso, in both directions. Facilities There is one platform, which is long enough to accommodate a nine-carriage train. The station is fully wheelchair-accessible, but it is not monitored by CCTV. The station has a ticket office, staffed between approximately 10:00 and 17:00 every day except Sundays. There are no self-service ticket machines or smartcard top-up facilities, although there are smartcard validators. Other facilities include: a free car park with 3 parking spaces, a sheltered bike stand with 10 spaces, a payphone that accepts both cash and card, waiting rooms with designated seating areas, toilets (only open during staffing hours) and a post box. There is a bus stop located directly outside the station, although the majority of bus services call at the nearby Miller Academy stop, to the north. Services Despite being located at the end of the branch line, Thurso is not the terminus for any passenger services. Instead, trains run between and ; upon reaching they branch off the main route to serve Thurso, then reverse and run back to Georgemas Junction before continuing to their respective destinations. This means that all services call at Georgemas Junction station twice per trip.GB eNRT May 2016 Edition, Table 239 On weekdays and Saturdays, the station is served by eight trains per day to , of which four continue to (via , , , and ), and four continue to . On Sundays the frequency drops to just two trains per day to Georgemas Junction, of which one goes to Inverness and one to Wick. An hourly shuttle between Wick and Thurso making use of Vivarail's Class 230 Battery Multiple Units has been proposed by the Friends of the Far North line, but to this date nothing has been confirmed.

As a result of the inhibition of actin polymerization, cytochalasins can change cellular morphology, inhibit cellular processes such as cell division, and even cause cells to undergo apoptosis. Cytochalasins have the ability to permeate cell membranes, prevent cellular translocation and cause cells to enucleate. Cytochalasins can also have an effect on other aspects of biological processes unrelated to actin polymerization. For example, cytochalasin A and cytochalasin B can also inhibit the transport of monosaccharides across the cell membrane, cytochalasin H has been found to regulate plant growth, cytochalasin D inhibits protein synthesis and cytochalasin E prevents angiogenesis.  Binding to actin filaments  Cytochalasins are known to bind to the barbed, fast growing plus ends of microfilaments, which then blocks both the assembly and disassembly of individual actin monomers from the bound end. Once bound, cytochalasins essentially cap the end of the new actin filament. One cytochalasin will bind to one actin filament. Studies done with cytochalasin D (CD) have found that CD-actin dimers contain ATP-bound actin upon formation. These CD-actin dimers are reduced to CD-actin monomers as a result of ATP hydrolysis. The resulting CD-actin monomer can bind ATP-actin monomer to reform the CD-actin dimer. CD is very effective; only low concentrations (0.2 ŒºM) are needed to prevent membrane ruffling and disrupt treadmilling. The effects of many different cytochalasins on actin filaments were analyzed and higher concentrations (2-20 ŒºM) of CD were found to be needed to remove stress fibers. In contrast, latrunculin inhibits actin filament polymerization by binding to actin monomers.  Uses and applications of cytochalasins  Actin microfilaments have been widely studied using cytochalasins. Due to their chemical nature, cytochalasins can help researchers understand the importance of actin in various biological processes. The use of cytochalasins has allowed researchers to better understand actin polymerization, cell motility, ruffling, cell division, contraction, and cell stiffness. The use of cytochalasins has been so important to understanding cytoskeletal movement and many other biological processes, researchers have created two synthetic cytochalasins. Cytochalasin has found practical application in thromboelastometry (TEM) whole blood assays for the assessment of fibrinogen and fibrin polymerization disorders in the FIBTEM assay on ROTEM. This test is based on the principle that cytochalasin D very effectively inhibits platelet function by inhibition of the contractile elements. The platelet inhibition is more effective than when platelets are blocked by GPIIb/IIIa antagonists. In vitro and clinical data indicate that the clot strength in FIBTEM increases in a fibrinogen concentration-dependent manner independent of platelet count. Therefore, fibrinogen deficiency or fibrin polymerization disorders can be rapidly detected.

Disquisitiones criticae in praecipuas canonum et decretalium collectiones, 1836 He was the son of a shoemaker. As a boy, he was a pupil at the gymnasium of St. Mathias at Breslau, Silesia, then in the Kingdom of Prussia, and studied theology in the same city. Together with his brother Anthony he wrote, Einfuhrung der erzwungenen Ehelosigkeit bei den Geistlichen (1828). At the advice of this brother he abandoned theology and turned his attention to law, which he studied at Breslau and Halle, and in 1829 he obtained a degree in law at the latter university. He then received a scholarship from the Prussian Government, which enabled him to make researches in Belgium, England, and France as to the sources of Canon law. He finally went to Rome, where he settled permanently. Here, under the influence of Count Reisach, then rector of the Propaganda and later cardinal, the change in his opinions was completed. In 1835, he wrote the Geschichte der geistlichen Bildungsanstalten, and in 1836 the Disquisitiones criticae, on the sources of canon law. Soon after this he became a priest and entered the Oratory of St. Philip Neri. In the succeeding years he wrote the following works: *Die neuesten Zust√§nde der kath. Kirche in Polen und Russland (1841) *Die R√ºckkehr der regierenden Hauser Braunschweig und Sachsen zur kath. Kirche (1843) *Zust√§nde der kath. Kirche in Schlesien 1740-58 (1846) *Kardinal Frankenberg (1850) He was commissioned by Pope Pius IX, who had given him a position in the Vatican Library in 1850, to write the Geschichte des Pontifikats Klemens XIV (1853; Italian translation, 1855). In this work he showed himself an opponent of the Jesuits, with whom he had been on good terms until 1844, so that the work was forbidden in the States of the Church. In 1855, Pius IX appointed Theiner as Prefect of the Vatican secret archives. He now published his collections of authorities drawn from these: *Die Fortsetzung der Annalen des Baronius (3 vols., 1856) *Vetera monumenta Hungariae (2 vols., 1859‚Äì60) *Poloniae et Lithuaniae (4 vols., 1860‚Äì64) *Slavorum meridionalium (2 vols., 1863) *Hibernorum et Scotorum (1864) *Codex dominii temporalis apostolicae sedis (3 vols., 1861‚Äì62) *Monumenta spectantia ad unionem ecclesiarum Graecae et Romanae (1872). Both before and during the First Vatican Council he was in close connection with the opponents of papal infallibility. Because he communicated to them the order of business of the Council of Trent, that had been kept secret, he was deposed from his dignities and offices. Whether he died at peace with the Church is questionable. His correspondence with the Old Catholic scholar, Johann Friedrich, during the years 1870-73 shows that he held the same views as the latter; on the other hand Count Hermann Stainlein asserts that he knew Theiner during this period as a loyal Catholic priest. In any event, he was buried at the Teutonic Cemetery, adjacent to St. Peter's Basilica, which is reserved for German-speaking residents of the city in service to the institutions of the Catholic Church.Vatican City website \\"Teutonic Cemetery\\" There is no doubt as to his large scholarship and his services to history.

It is an early adaptation of Anthony Burgess' 1962 novel A Clockwork Orange, starring Gerard Malanga, Edie Sedgwick, Ondine, and Tosh Carillo, and featuring such songs as \\"Nowhere to Run\\" by Martha and the Vandellas, \\"Tired of Waiting for You\\" by The Kinks, \\"The Last Time\\" by The Rolling Stones and \\"Shout\\" by The Isley Brothers. Plot The film is about the youth perpetrator Victor, who spends his time lifting weights, dancing and torturing people. When he hits his friend Scum Baby, he calls the police. Victor gets the choice to go to jail or undergo a behavioral change. Victor decides on the treatment and is bound to a chair by a doctor. He has to watch violent videos and describe what is happening on the screen while warm wax from a candle runs over his hand. After a while Victor swears off the violence and is unbound. He rejects the doctor's request to beat him and take drugs. Victor is cured. Cast * Gerard Malanga as Victor * Edie Sedgwick as Extra * Ondine as Scum Baby * Tosh Carillo as The Doctor * Larry Latrae * J.D. McDermott as Cop * Jacques Potin as Extra Background Vinyl was the first adaptation of the novel, which was filmed six years later by Stanley Kubrick (see A Clockwork Orange). Warhol bought the book in the spring of 1965 and forwarded it to his screenwriter Ronald Tavel. He had claimed that he had secured the right to the story for $3,000. The film is solely based on the original and reproduces the plot in a very condensed form and the names of the characters have also changed. The recording of Vinyl took place on a day in April / early May 1965 with a very low budget and without samples. The only location in the film is a corner in Warhol's Factory while the 16mm black and white camera, the Auricon brand, stood on a stand and was barely moved. Vinyl was originally supposed to consist of a purely male casting and bring out Gerard Malanga; but since the model Edie Sedgwick, who Warhol had met earlier the same year, coincidentally showed up for photography, Warhol gave her the last minute role in the strip.David Bourdon: Warhol, DuMont, K√∂ln 1989, S. 203 Some of the extras in Vinyl did not even realize that they were filmed and had no connection to the plot. The movie features the songs \\"Nowhere to Run\\" by Martha and the Vandellas, \\"Tired of Waiting for You\\" by The Kinks, \\"The Last Time\\" by The Rolling Stones and \\"Shout\\" by The Isley Brothers. \\"Nowhere to Run\\" is played twice in full length while the artists dance to it. Vinyl was shown the first time on June 4, 1965 as part of Jonas Mekas' Film-Makers' Cinematheque listing. Stanley Kubrick's 1971 film, as well as Vinyl, begins with a close-up of the protagonist's face. Why the movie is called Vinyl is unclear. Production Vinyl is often credited as Edie Sedgwick 's first appearance in film, although she actually appeared in a non-speaking role in the earlier Warhol movie Horse (1965). Sedgwick has no lines of dialogue in the entire film. Vinyl was filmed unrehearsed and was also performed live in various stage productions.Joseph, Branden. Neo-Dada and Pop Art, Fall 2007 G4848 at Columbia University, December 4, 2007 lecture. Legacy Vinyl is included in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die. Coincidentally, a HBO series by the name of Vinyl had Warhol as a recurring character; despite this the series has nothing in common with the Warhol film because it is about music in New York rather than art.

Wongar (born 1932 as Sreten Bo≈æiƒá) is a Serbian-Australian writer. For most of his literary career, the concern of his writing has been, almost exclusively, the condition of Aboriginal people in Australia.David Matthews: B. Wongar (Sreten Bozic), University of Newcastle His 1978 short story collection, The Track to Bralgu, was released to critical acclaim by the foreign press, who were led to believe by publisher Little Brown that Wongar was of Aboriginal ethnicity. The revelation that Wongar was a Serbian immigrant, as well as inconsistencies in his life story, have led to controversy and allegations of literary hoax and cultural appropriation.  Early life  Bo≈æiƒá grew up in the village of Gornja Tre≈°njevica, near Aranƒëelovac, Serbia, then Kingdom of Yugoslavia. In the mid-1950s, he started his writing career by writing poetry which he published in the Mlada kultura and the Novi vesnik literary journals. He was a member of the \\"ƒêuro Salaj\\" workers-writers group in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. At the same time he worked as a journalist in Serbia. Yugoslav communists found his writing politically incorrect and banned him from journalism for life. In 1958 he moved to Paris, France, where he lived in a Red Cross refugee camp. There he met Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir who helped him to publish his literary works in Les Temps Modernes.Aleksandar Petroviƒá: DVE POVESTI I JEDNA PRIƒåA Uvod u delo B.

In his search for a job (as a construction worker or miner), he bought a camel in order to cross the Tanami Desert. He got lost and was close to death when he was saved by a tribal man. Bo≈æiƒá lived with tribal Aboriginal people for ten years. The name B(anumbir) Wongar, which means morning star and messenger from the spirit world, was said to be given to him by his tribal wife Dumala and her relatives. However, he later stated in an interview that \\"B.\\" is in recognition of his Serbian name.David Matthews: B. Wongar (Sreten Bozic 1932 -), University of Newcastle From Dumala he learned about Aboriginal poetry and their traditional way of life in the bush. This way he was introduced to the Aboriginal culture that had been suppressed and delegitimized by British colonial power for centuries. His book The Track to Bralgu is a collection of stories based on traditional Aboriginal stories belonging to the Yolngu people of Arnhem Land, NT, Australia. The book was translated into French as Le Chemin du Bralgu, from the original manuscript and published in Les Temps Modernes (1977), a magazine which was edited by Sartre and de Beauvoir. When the book appeared in the English edition a year later, it heralded a new genre of creative writing and brought international fame to the author.New York Times Book Review, 25 June 1978 In Australia, however, Wongar was criticized for his portrayal of Aboriginal people, and there was a campaign to discredit his work as fake. He was not allowed to stay any longer in the Northern part of Australia and had to move to Melbourne. His wife Dumala and the children were to follow but they died from drinking water from a poisoned well, as claimed later in Dingoes Den, his autobiography (at the end of Chapter 12). While he was in the Northern part of Australia, Wongar worked on his Totem and Ore photographic collection, also known under the title Boomerang and Atom. The collection contained several thousand black-and- white photographs portraying the impact of uranium mining and the British nuclear testing on tribal Aborigines. In 1974, Wongar was asked to send some of the Totem and Ore photographs for an exhibition in the Parliament House Library in Canberra. The exhibition was banned by order of the Australian parliament only a few hours after the official opening.\\"Cold War spy, the photographer, and hidden history from a big land\\", The Age, 11 November 2006 Wongar settled on his bush property Dingo Den in Gippsland, south of Melbourne where, helped by photographic images from his Totem and Ore collection, he wrote his \\"Nuclear Trilogy\\", comprising the novels, Walg, Karan, and Gabo Djara.Ross, Robert: \\"The track to Armageddon in B.Wongar‚Äôs Nuclear Trilogy,\\" World Literature Today, Winter 1990 The trilogy was first published in Germany, translated from the original manuscript by Annemarie and Heinrich B√∂ll. The English language edition first appeared in 1988. It was launched at the Aboriginal Research Centre, Monash University, where Wongar at the time was serving as writer-in-residence. While he was at work, police raided Wongar's home at Dingo Den and took some of his work, including the sole copy of the manuscript of his new novel Raki. In 1990, the Australian author Thomas Shapcott spoke about the case at the opening of the Adelaide Arts Festival. He circulated a petition asking the state authorities to see that the confiscated manuscript Raki be returned to Wongar. About 200 writers at the festival signed the petition.Pullan, Robert: \\"In Police Custody: 200 Pages of B.

Wongar (Sreten Bozic 1932 -), University of Newcastle Wongar's books have been translated into 13 languages with over one million copies sold (as of 2006). His books are the most widely known literary representation of Australian Aboriginal culture.  Reception of Wongar's work in Australia Reception of Wongar's work has oscillated between praise, sceptical inquiry and moral condemnation. Within Australia there is a widespread obsession with Wongar's biographical credentials to the extent that it eclipses any review of the fictional texts as part of Australian writing. There are a variety of Wongar's moral indictments ranging from being a white who usurped Aboriginal culture to the claim saying that all artists are charlatans, who con the public.Sneja Gunew: Culture, gender and the author-function: 'Wongar's' Walg in Australian Cultural Studies: A Reader, by John Frow, Meaghan Morris (ed), University of Illinois Press, 1993 Susan Hosking claimed that Wongar did not speak as an Aboriginal person but pretended to be one. Aboriginal writers were finding their own voice and, she claims, there was a strong resistance against such a European writer, because it was seen as a cultural imperialism. Australian critic Maggie Nolan responded that a reductive demand for an authentic Aboriginality functions as cultural imperialism. Far from being labelled as a cultural imperialist, Wongar shall be congratulated for subtly manipulating expectations of authenticity in his work. Wongar questions the systematic closure of Aboriginality as an imperial construct, its pretensions to its authenticity, autonomy, and purity.David Callahan: Contemporary Issues in Australian Literature: International Perspectives, Routledge, 25 February 2014, p. 56 Wongar has received criticism to the point of being labelled a fake, literary hoax and accused of cultural appropriation. Australian novelist and playwright Thomas Keneally has said, \\"Time might prove him to be a highly significant Australian writer, but his deception has soured his reception in the English- speaking world.\\" Much of this centres around his identify, as there are many discrepancies regarding the identify of Wongar in the forewords of his books. In his book, The Track to Bralgu, the foreword states that Wongar is part Aboriginal, while in his book The Sinners, the foreword states that Wongar is in fact a mixed race American Vietnam veteran.

The English edition was substantially and carefully purged of colonialist pornography and pseudo- Aboriginal mythology. In his autobiography, Dingoes Den, Wongar wrote that the German translation remains the only complete text and unabridged version. Awards and honors * Arvon Foundation Poetry Award.

It is located on a rocky crest above the confluence of Soƒça and Idrijca rivers. In the past these two riverbeds, deeply carved into the rocky slopes, provided the settlement with excellent protection from intruders. Due to the nearby Doblar hydro plant, the basins of the river were entirely inundated and below the settlement a vast reservoir was formed, which now attracts both fishermen and visitors, who can stroll along some well-kept panoramic paths.Tolmin municipal site Name Most na Soƒçi was first attested as In Ponte Sancti Mauri (literally, 'at Saint Maurus' bridge') in reference to the local church.Kru≈°iƒá, Marjan et al. 1996.

In the 17th century, the name ad Pontem 'at the bridge' was recorded, and a church built between 1584 and 1612 was the source of the name Sveta Lucija (na Mostu) 'Saint Lucy (on the bridge)'. Under Italian administration, the settlement was known as Santa Lucia (di Tolmino) 'Saint Lucy (of Tolmin)', and after the Second World War the Slovene name Sveta Lucija ob Soƒçi 'Saint Lucy on the Soƒça River' was established. Other historical names include German St. Luzia and Maurus Br√ºcke. The name of the settlement was changed from Sveta Lucija ob Soƒçi to Most na Soƒçi (literally, 'bridge on the Soƒça River') in 1955. The name was changed on the basis of the 1948 Law on Names of Settlements and Designations of Squares, Streets, and Buildings as part of efforts by Slovenia's postwar communist government to remove religious elements from toponyms.Spremembe naselij 1948‚Äì95. 1996.

Sikat is best known for his classic masterpieces particularly Impeng Negro, a short story based on a half-black, half-Filipino boy and Moses, Moses, a play in one act that depicts the social injustices and the abuse of the country's oppressive politicians. He uses \\"Sikat\\" as a pen name to reflect on his Filipino identity (The Filipino alphabet originally does not have the letter c) as his real surname is \\"Sicat\\". Apart from being one of the Philippines‚Äô finest modern literary figures, Sikat was also a distinguished educator. He was a former university professor and former college dean of the University of the Philippines‚Äô College of Arts and Letters. Sikat was born on June 26, 1940 in the town of San Isidro in the province of Nueva Ecija, as the sixth of eight children of Estanislao Sikat and Crisanta Rodriguez. For his college education, Sikat went to Manila to study in the University of Santo Tomas. During his time at UST, Sikat served as a writer for the university's official newspaper, The Varsitarian. Sikat's love for literature further heightened and his writing skills flourished with his stint with The Varsitarian. After finishing his Bachelor of Arts in Journalism, Sikat continued his love for writing. Despite the country's love for western culture, Sikat took the path less traveled and wrote and succeeded with the Filipino language. In 1962, Sikat's Impeng Negro won the first prize in Liwayway magazine's best short story and the prized Carlos Palanca Award both in the same year. The short story Impeng Negro catapulted Sikat into the upper echelons of Philippine literature. Impeng Negro touches critical social issues including racism and bullying. Impeng Negro was adapted into a short film entitled, Impen, the Negro. The short 30-minute film won 1st prize in the Short Feature Film Category in the 12th Gawad CCP for alternative film and video. Sikat wrote several other short stories during his lifetime including Tata Selo, a fictional narrative based on the real-life land reform issues and recurring political cruelties in the Philippines. It won the second prize in the Carlos Palanca Award for 1963. In 1969, Sikat's socio-critical play Moses, Moses won the Carlos Palanca Award, further solidifying Sikat's position among the titans of Philippine literature. Sikat worked in the newspaper and magazine industry, serving as a feature writer for the long-running Liwayway magazine.

Justice Idington, writing for the majority, held that: :Indeed, the duty to protect neighbouring property owners in such cases as are involved in this question before us renders the question hardly arguable. There are many instances of other nuisances which can be better rectified by local legislation within the power of the legislatures over property and civil rights than by designating them crimes and leaving them to be dealt with by Parliament as such. (p. 684) In a concurring opinion, Justice Anglin added: :I am of the opinion that this statute in no way impinges on the domain of the criminal law but is concerned exclusively with the control and enjoyment of property and the safeguarding of the community from the consequences of an illegal and injurious use being made of it--a pure matter of civil right.

It is located on the West Highland Line. The routes to Fort William/Mallaig and Oban diverge after this station. Access to the platform is via a flight of stairs from a subway that runs underneath the tracks, from the car park which is slightly lower than the station itself.  History  Crianlarich (Upper) station in 1957 The station buildings from the south Crianlarich station opened concurrently with the West Highland Railway on 7 August 1894, doubling the number of railway stations in the village. The lines and station were eventually built by the state under compulsory purchase arrangements sought after the persistent rejection by the landowners the Place family of Loch Dochart House and Skelton Grange, Yorkshire who even turned down the offer of having all the proceeds from the two station tea-rooms in perpetuity. The Places felt that the project would spoil their shooting grounds; the family sold their house and estate shortly after their defeat and retreated to Yorkshire. The station was laid out with a crossing loop around an island platform and sidings on both sides. On the east side there was an engine shed and a turntable. Three years after opening, in 1897, a junction and link line down to the Callander and Oban Railway, which passed below the West Highland route, was added. Originally, the junction incorporated a scissors crossover, allowing simultaneous moves through the junction. However until 1931 the link line was only used to exchange goods wagons between the two lines. From 1931 onwards, it was also used for excursion traffic from Glasgow and the surrounding areas to the Oban line. The station was host to a LNER camping coach from 1937 to 1939. In 1951, British Rail added the suffix \\"Upper\\" to the station's name, in order to distinguish it from the nearby station (only about walk along the north east access road) on the Callander and Oban Line which then became known as . Since closure of the Callander and Oban Line east of Crianlarich in 1965 due to a landslide that submerged the railway in Glen Ogle, all trains to Oban have been routed up the West Highland Line as far as Crianlarich Upper station. They then join the remaining part of the Oban line by means of the link line, which had formerly been infrequently used. Crianlarich Lower station closed on 28 September 1965, and on 1 November 1965 the Upper station's name reverted to \\"Crianlarich\\". The late 19th century 13-bay brick engine shed still stands and Historic Scotland have designated it as a category C listed building. It is now used by the Permanent Way engineers. Services Northbound, Crianlarich is where the combined trains for Oban and Mallaig divide, with each of the services leaving roughly five minutes apart. Southbound, when each train arrives from Oban or Mallaig, it joins with the other and they go down as one train from Crianlarich. In the summer 2019 timetable, three additional services run to/from Oban only in addition to the trio of combined workings.GB eNRT May 2019 Edition, Table 227 (Network Rail) Mondays to Saturdays, there are six services to Oban, three to Mallaig and one service to Fort William (Highland Caledonian Sleeper) northbound. Southbound, there are six services to Glasgow Queen Street and one service to London Euston (Highland Caledonian Sleeper, which does not run on Saturday). On Sundays, there are three services to Oban all year and one or two (depending on the time of year) to Mallaig northbound. Southbound, there are four trains to Glasgow Queen Street and one to London Euston (the sleeper calls at Queen Street Low Level & Edinburgh to set down only, as it conveys seated coaches as well as sleeping cars and can thus be used by regular passengers).  Station building  An independently operated tea room is located in the station building. The station buildings are not the original ones: these (which were of the standard 'West Highland' design) were destroyed by fire in 1937.  Freight facilities  Timber wagons being loaded at Crianlarich (19 July 2006) The area around the station is forested. The sidings on the west side of the station were used for loading timber until December 2008 when the carriage of Scottish timber by rail ceased in connection with the recession. As of June 2015, there is still no sign of the service being reinstated. Timber trains leaving the sidings at Crianlarich often paused at Arrochar and Tarbet to attach further wagons, the sidings at both stations are now used by the Area Civil Engineer for the storage of materials.  Signalling  From the time of its opening in 1894, the West Highland Railway was worked throughout by the electric token system. Crianlarich signal box was situated at the north end of the island platform. In 1967, the method of working between Crianlarich and was changed to the Scottish Region Tokenless Block system. In August 1985, the method of working between Crianlarich and Rannoch reverted to the electric token block system. The semaphore signals were removed in stages during December 1985 in preparation for the introduction of Radio Electronic Token Block (RETB) by British Rail. Track layout alterations were made at the same time, including simplification of the junction and extension of the crossing loop at the south end. The RETB, which is controlled from a Signalling Centre at Banavie railway station, was commissioned from to and on 27 March 1988.\\"RETB\\"Scot-rail.co.uk; Retrieved 27 April 2016 The junction points at the north end of the station are electrically operated and the route selected by means of a plunger at the platform end operated by the train driver.

The large rock in the middle of the painting has named the place. A ferry is on its way from Ropsten to Liding√∂ with a horse and cart on board. Ropsten is a cape at the eastern part of Stockholm mainland at the inner part of Stockholm archipelago in Sweden. Two bridges named Liding√∂bron extend from Ropsten over to the island of Liding√∂. Ropsten area is located between Hjorthagen and the Stockholm city main port V√§rtahamnen. Ropsten is the terminal station for the eastern part of Stockholm Metro system and is also the terminal station for Liding√∂banan, the railway for public transportation, covering the area of Liding√∂. History Ropsten has been the communication center for the traffic between Stockholm and Liding√∂ since the 13th or 14th century, when the first inhabitants settled on Liding√∂ and began farming, 200‚Äì300 years after the end of the Viking Age. The name \\"Ropsten\\" stems from the fact that in old times, going back to the 13th or 14th century, people used to shout out loud from this area to Liding√∂, a distance of about 750 meters, to call for a boat transport over to Liding√∂, before the first regular rowboat ferry line was introduced and before the first bridge was built. In the old times, the part of the Ropsten area close to the waterfront was named Ropudden (corresponding to \\"cape shout\\"). The large rock or islet in the water close to this cape gave the place its name, \\"the rock at cape shout\\", Ropsten. The rock itself, however, was probably not used as a place to shout from, as it was surrounded by water (during average sea level conditions) according to old maps from the end of the 17th century, in particular a map from 1696. When there was an extreme low sea levelThe sea level in the Baltic Sea normally fluctuates between -0.5 meter to +0.5 meter, in extreme case up to one meter, depending on atmospheric tide differences between the Baltic Sea and the North Sea in the Atlantic Ocean. When there is high atmospheric pressure in the Baltic area compared to the atmospheric pressure in the North Sea for a longer period, the water is pressed out into the Atlantic Ocean and the water level will sink. it was probably possible to reach the rock by foot, as indicated on the painting by Piere Joseph Trere from 1795. The entire area, named Ropsten, dramatically changed appearance in just a few years when the first bridge between Ropsten and Liding√∂ and the main port for Stockholm was built in this area from around 1884. Today nothing remains of the old Ropsten as it appears on the painting from 1795. Image gallery, Ropsten year 1696-2008 Image:Ropsten_1696.jpgMap from 1696, covering the area around Ropsten.

The film, a Zapata Western, tells the story of El Chuncho, a bandit, and Bill Tate (or El Ni√±o/The Kid), a counter-revolutionary contract killer in Mexico. Chuncho soon learns that social revolution is more important than mere money. Plot During the Mexican Revolution, a Durango-bound government munitions train is forced to stop due to the presence of a crucified federal army officer on the tracks. El Chuncho Mu√±os, a gun runner loyal to the revolutionary leader General El√≠as, leads his gang in an assault on the train. Lieutenant Alvaro Ferreira commanding the rurales of the escort attempts to save the officer, but upon being fatally wounded by Chuncho, he is forced to order the train to run the captain over and escape the bandits. Bill Tate, an American passenger on the train, kills the engineer and stops the train again, allowing Chuncho and his gang to kill the remaining rurales and take their weapons. Posing as a former prisoner of the army, Tate joins the gang, and is quickly befriended by Chuncho, who nicknames him \\"Ni√±o\\". After several heists, the gang travels to the town of San Miguel, where Chuncho meets with his old friend Raimundo to overthrow the weakhearted town boss, Don Felipe. Rosaria, Felipe's spirited wife, attempts to defend him; when Chuncho's men assault her, Tate angrily berates them for their behaviour. Chuncho shoots Guapo, a gang member, for attempting to kill Tate. Don Felipe is made to drive Chuncho and his gang back to San Miguel, and he is eventually executed. Chuncho prepares to stay in San Miguel, drilling the villagers in the hopes of becoming a General himself; Tate convinces much of the gang to leave San Miguel so they can sell their weapons to El√≠as. Eventually missing his bandit lifestyle, Chuncho leaves San Miguel under the care of El Santo, his priestly half-brother, on the pretext of recovering a gold-plated Hotchkiss M1914 machine gun from his former gang. After killing one of them, Picaro, Chuncho resumes leadership of the others, hoping to sell the weapons to El√≠as before returning to San Miguel. El√≠as' emissary arrives, but is pursued by army troops. Tate and Chuncho use the machine gun to decimate the troops, but nearly all of Chuncho's remaining gang is killed in the firefight. Unseen by the others, Tate also kills the emissary. Adelita, Chuncho's last surviving loyal gang member, abandons the pair after her lover, Pepito, is killed in the battle. During the ride to El√≠as' camp, Tate falls victim to a malaria attack. While getting quinine pills for Tate, Chuncho finds a golden bullet among his possessions. Chuncho and Tate arrive at El√≠as' camp the next morning, where they encounter several starving revolutionaries. Chuncho sells the guns and is paid five thousand pesos, before learning from El√≠as that the people of San Miguel were massacred by the army. Realising his irresponsibility, Chuncho allows himself to be taken away to be executed by Santo, one of the sole survivors of the attack. Meanwhile, Tate, from a high vantage point, shoots El√≠as and kills Santo before Chuncho's sentence can be carried out. Tate escapes as El√≠as' doctors pronounce his death: shot in the head with a golden bullet. Weeks later, Chuncho, now an impoverished beggar, tracks Tate to a hotel in Ciudad Juarez and tries to shoot him. Tate, insisting that he has been waiting for him, gives him a half-share of the reward he received from the Mexican Government for assassinating El√≠as: 100,000 pesos in gold. Chuncho, astonished by Tate's apparent loyalty and friendship, visits a barber, a tailor and a brothel. The next morning the pair prepare to leave for a new life in the United States. However, when Chuncho watches as Tate cuts through a line to buy their train tickets, he begins to reconsider their relationship and his responsibilities. Learning that he had been further manipulated by Tate through his pretending to be an army prisoner, Chuncho suddenly declares that, although they are friends, he must kill him. Tate asks why, to which Chuncho replies \\"¬øQui√©n sabe?\\" before shooting him.\\"¬øQui√©n sabe?\\" means \\"Who knows?\\" in Spanish. In the American version, this line is translated as \\"I don't know.\\" Tate's body begins its return to the United States, while Chuncho, laughing manically, tosses his bag of money to a group of peasants and flees from the authorities down an external corridor of carriages, exhorting the poor to buy dynamite instead of bread.

Film historian Howard Hughes noted that A Bullet for the General was the first Italian Western to seriously deal with the Mexican revolution and credited Solinas with the political aspects on the film. Solinas was a Marxist writer best known in film for his screenplays for Salvatore Giuliano and The Battle of Algiers. A Bullet for the General was directed by Damiano Damiani and shot in Almer√≠a between July and August 1966. Damiani had originally wanted to shoot the film in Mexico which proved to be impossible. Release A Bullet for the General was released in Italy in December 1966. Reception In a contemporary review, the Monthly Film Bulletin declared the film to be \\"a lively sortie into the Mexican Revolution with a good deal of boisterous action and a spirited performance from Gian Maria Volonte\\". The review noted the running time cut from 135 minutes to 77 minutes, stating \\"substantial pruning unfortunately plays havoc with the continuity (a character who was clearly of some importance in the original is here reduced to a few marginal references).\\" Damiano's film has been called a \\"serious statement about the Mexican Revolution\\" and has been recognised as an accomplished blend of \\"tension, action, politics and history\\".

To augment the cheeks, a plastic surgeon may place a solid implant over the cheekbone. Injections with the patients' own fat or a soft tissue filler, like Restylane, are also popular. Rarely, various cuts to the zygomatic bone (cheekbone) may be performed. Cheek augmentation is commonly combined with other procedures, such as a face lift or chin augmentation. Implants Materials Cheek implants can be made of a variety of materials. The most common material is solid silicone. In addition, two popular options are high-density porous polyethylene, marketed as Medpor, and ePTFE (expanded polytetrafluoroethylene), better known as Gore- Tex. Both Medpor and ePTFE are inert substances, providing better integration with the underlying tissue and bone than solid silicone. However, in the case of Medpor, the implants' integration and ingrowth with the underlying tissue causes difficulty removing the implant if revisions are needed.Augmentation options All About Cheek Augmentation: A Patient Education and Support Network. Last accessed 6 July 2009.High-density porous polyethylene implantseMedicine.com from WebMed. Medscape Last accessed 7 July 2009. Shapes There are three general shapes to cheek implants: malar, submalar, or combined. Malar implants, the most common shape, are placed directly on the cheekbones. The result is more projection to the cheekbones, providing a \\"higher\\" contour to the side of the face. In contrast, submalar implants are not placed on the cheekbones. They are intended to augment the midface, especially if the person has a gaunt or \\"sunken\\" appearance to this area. Combined implants or malar/submalar combination, are an extended implant intended to augment both the midface and the cheekbones.Malar and Submalar Implants: OvervieweMedicine.com from WebMed. Medscape. Last accessed 7 July 2009. Incisions A surgeon will usually make an incision in the upper mouth near the top of the gum line and slide the implants into place. Another method is to make an external incision near the eye, but most patients do not choose this method since it can create a visible scar. However, the intraoral (inside the mouth) approach carries a higher risk of infection since the mouth contains more bacteria. Cheek implant surgery is usually performed under sedation or general anesthesia and take about one to two hours. Recovery from this surgery usually takes about ten days. Risks As with any surgery there is a risk of infection, postoperative bleeding, formation of a blood clot, and severe swelling. Asymmetry is a risk with all forms of cheek augmentation. This can occur due to uneven resorption, implant displacement, or shifting. This shift can happen due to swelling, trauma or scarring. Although a temporary loss of sensation is common, an extended loss of sensation can occur with any surgery, especially cosmetic plastic surgery. Fillers or injections Injections to the cheekbones to provide a less invasive and less expensive approach to cheek augmentation. A hyaluronic acid, such as Restylane or Juvederm, can be injected to the cheek area. Autologous fat is considered a \\"more permanent\\" option, but all are eventually completely resorbed.Injectable Fillers University of Michigan Dept. of Surgery website. Last accessed 7 July 2009. Zygomatic osteotomy A zygomatic \\"sandwich\\" osteotomy is far less common. The procedure is often indicated during reconstructive surgery for birth defects or traumatic injury. During this procedure, the zygoma, or cheekbone, is separated by bone cuts near the orbital rim and maxilla. The bone is then moved outward and a solid material, such as hydroxylapatite, is wedged in place to hold the new position of the zygoma.Milrolo, Michael et al.

This station is on the West Highland Line. Being an island platform, access is via a subway.  History  Bridge of Orchy station in the 1980s This station opened by the West Highland Railway on 7 August 1894.Butt (1995), page 43 The station was laid out with a crossing loop around an island platform and sidings on the east side of the station. The station was host to a LNER camping coach from 1935 to 1939 and possibly one for some of 1934.McRae (1997), page 11 On 1 February 1987, the crossing loop was altered to right-hand running. The original Down platform has thus become the Up platform, and vice versa. The change was made in order to simplify shunting at this station, by removing the need to hand-pump the train-operated loop points to access the sidings.  Signalling  The signal box, which had 16 levers, was situated at the south end of the island platform. From the time of its opening in 1894, the West Highland Railway was worked throughout by the electric token system. In 1967, the method of working between and was changed to the Scottish Region Tokenless block system. The Up loop at Bridge of Orchy was signalled for running in either direction and the signal box was able to 'switch out' when not required. In August 1985, the method of working between Crianlarich and Rannoch reverted to the electric token block system. The semaphore signals were removed on 24 November 1985 in preparation for the introduction of Radio Electronic Token Block (RETB). The RETB system was commissioned by British Rail between and Fort William Junction on 29 May 1988. This resulted in the closure of Bridge of Orchy signal box (amongst others). The RETB is controlled from a Signalling Centre at Banavie railway station. The Train Protection & Warning System was installed in 2003.  Station building  The station building is now used as a bunkhouse for those walking the West Highland Way.  Services  Monday to Saturday, northbound, Bridge of Orchy has three services to Mallaig and one service to Fort William (the Highland Caledonian Sleeper). Southbound, there are three services to Glasgow Queen Street and one service to London Euston (Highland Caledonian Sleeper, Saturdays excepted). On Sundays, there is just one service northbound to Mallaig all year, with a second in the summer months only (May to late October), one service southbound to Glasgow Queen Street (two in summer) and one service (the Highland Caledonian Sleeper) to London Euston. This can also be used by regular travellers to both Glasgow Queen Street (L.L) and Edinburgh Waverley on all evenings that it runs, as it is booked to set down at both stations and carries seating coaches as far as Edinburgh.

View from Hotel Foresta towards Ropsten. The latest bridge, built in 1971. in the front. Liding√∂bron (Swedish: \\"The Liding√∂ Bridge\\") is the name of two existing and two historical bridges across the strait of Lilla V√§rtan between the mainland Norra Djurg√•rden at Ropsten, at the eastern part of Stockholm, and the island of Liding√∂. History First pontoon bridge At a parish meeting in 1802, the inhabitants of Liding√∂, at the time a mostly agricultural district, decided to open a venture to realize a pontoon bridge connecting the island to Stockholm. The 50 shares of the company had to be redeemed by contributing to the project with timber, work, or money and the bridge was completed in 1803; almost long, wide and financed by tolls. It was one of the longest bridges in Europe, and it was located around south of the present bridges. It had a hard time surviving the annual ice break-up, and a third of it was demolished in 1811, and most of it in 1858 ‚Äî each time raising the price for milk in the capital, as most of it was produced on Liding√∂ at the time. Second pontoon bridge With the creation of the harbour of V√§rtahamnen, the original bridge obstructed shipping in the strait, and it was therefore bought by the city of Stockholm in 1883 who replaced it 1884 with a new pontoon bridge, wide and with two moveable sections at each end for the passage of ships. This bridge was located near the present bridge. The level of the roadway was only over the water surface however, so even moderate winds made crossing the bridge a tough experience. The lateral stability of the bridge was ensured by means of logs attached to the bridge every and anchored to the bottom. The use of logs instead of chains effectively increased the bridge's general buoyancy at the cost of its stability during low tide - the bridge often serpentined its way across the water while the inclination of the roadway at the two ends made use of extra horses necessary. Heavy trucks started to use the bridge, for which it was not constructed. Ice break-up destroyed a third of the bridge in 1918. Old Liding√∂bron By the end of World War I, the increasing number of motor cars made a more able bridge necessary, and by 1925 a steel truss bridge, wide with a long roadway, finally replaced the second pontoon bridge. It had two railway tracks in the same carriageway as the road. To avoid foundation work at the maximum depth a long truss arch was used, and the bridge was provided with a simple long bascule leaf in order to allow a vertical navigation clearance of . After the new bridge was built, cars were no longer allowed on the old bridge. It has one rail track which is now considered a tramway (or light rail line), the Liding√∂banan. The other half of the bridge is used for bicycles and pedestrians. New Liding√∂bron The population of Liding√∂ as well as the traffic continued to grow however, and by the 1950s the old bridge had become insufficient. The two municipalities met in 1961, and the following year it was settled a new bridge should be located south of the old. The new bridge, inaugurated in 1971, is long, wide, and offers a navigation clearance of while the roadway passes above the bottom of the strait. The part of the bridge passing over water, long, is made of double box girders with a maximum span of , the entire construction resting on steel poles filled with concrete.

The founding mainstay members were James Baker on drums, Dave Flick (Dave Faulkner) on guitar and vocals, and Rudolph V (Dave Cardwell) on bass guitar. Their debut single, \\"Television Addict\\", was issued in April 1978 and was followed by a five-track extended play, The Victims, in August of that year. The group disbanded early in the next year. In 1989 Timberyard Records released a compilation album, All Loud on the Western Front, of their material. In late 2014 and early 2015 Baker and Faulkner were joined by Ray Ahn (of Hard-Ons) as the Television Addicts to perform the Victims material. The 2014 and '15 shows were so well received that the trio rightly assumed the band name The Victims and played sold-out shows at Rosemount Hotel and Mojo's Bar.  History  The Victims were formed in Perth in mid-1977 with James Baker on drums (ex-Beheaded/The Geeks), Dave Flick (real name Dave Faulkner) on guitar and vocals (ex-Beagle Boys) and Rudolph V (real name Dave Cardwell) on bass guitar. Earlier in that year Baker and Cardwell had founded another punk band, the Geeks, with Ross Buncle on guitar and a vocalist, Lloyd. That group folded in May and their original songs formed the core of the Victims' initial repertoire. The group's sound was based on United States punk pioneers, the Flamin' Groovies, the Heartbreakers, New York Dolls, and the Stooges. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, felt that \\"with their frantic, explosive sound backed by a solid melodic bent, The Victims became the premier punk band on the Perth scene.\\" In 1977 the Victims recorded their debut single, \\"Television Addict\\" (Faulkner/Baker) / \\"I'm Flipped Out Over You\\" (Baker/Buncle), of which only 1,000 copies were pressed. In August 1978 they released a five-track extended play, The Victims (also known as No Thanks to the Human Turd), with: \\"I Understand\\", \\"Open Your Eyes\\", \\"TV Freak\\", \\"High School Girls\\" and \\"Disco Junkies\\". Baker was one of the writers of the latter four tracks; the identity of his co-composer was disputed ‚Äì some sources attributing Faulkner and others citing Buncle ‚Äì the situation was later resolved, with Buncle acknowledged as co-writer. Only 500 copies of the EP were released. Some versions had hand-drawn sleeves, which McFarlane described as \\"ultra-rare and highly prized collector's items.\\" Their performance at Hernando's Hideaway in Perth in January 1978 was recorded: it was issued on the live album, Culture Shock, in 2014. By mid-1978 the Victims had disbanded, they briefly reunited in early 1979 to provide a farewell gig. Baker was a founder of The Scientists (1978‚Äì81). Flick reverted to using his surname, Faulkner, and briefly joined Midget and The Farrellys. In late 1979, he joined Mannikins. Baker and Faulkner reunited in January 1981 and founded Hoodoo Gurus in Sydney. Rudolph V became a member of Love Assassins with Mark Hutchinson on guitar, John Rowlings on vocals and Marc Siddall on drums. In December 1989 the Victims material was issued as a compilation album, All Loud on the Western Front, on Timberyard Records. This included all the tracks from their first single and EP, as well as a previously unreleased track, \\"Perth Is a Culture Shock\\". It was re-issued on CD in 2005. \\"Television Addict\\" has been covered by Hoodoo Gurus (both live when Baker was still a member and on record for Crank, 2005 re-issue) and recorded by You Am I, The Hellacopters and Teengenerate. It is also a mainstay of Australian punk compilations. The song was also played live by United States band The Bronx on their 2007 Australian tour. The 2011 compilation, Sleeping Dogs Lie, was issued by Japanese label 1977 Records and distributed in Australia by the Fuse label. In addition to the tracks on All Loud on the Western Front it added two demo songs. In August 2014 Baker and Faulkner were joined by Ray Ahn (of Hard-Ons) on bass guitar as the Television Addicts at the Rosemount Hotel in North Perth. They performed the Victims material and in February of the following year gigged in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane. According to Faulkner, Cardwell was not asked to join as \\"we ended up not liking the third Victim very much and didn't want to have anything to do with him.\\" Discography  Albums  * All Loud on the Western Front Timberyard Records (compilation album, 1989) * Sleeping Dogs Lie (compilation album, 2011) * Culture Shock (live album, 2014)  Extended plays  * The Victims (aka No Thanks to the Human Turd) Independent (August 1978) Singles * \\"Television Addict\\" Independent (1977) Compilation appearances * Murder Punk, Volume 1: The Australian Years (1997) * Murder Punk, Volume 2: The Australian Years (1997) * Do The Pop!

From its south end, the route heads uphill across open, rolling fields, passing the modest headquarters of Local Media Group, publishers of the local daily, the Times Herald-Record. A bit further on, it passes the Hill‚ÄìHold historic site on the east and provides the main access to Thomas Bull Memorial Park, one of the county's most popular. After the park, the road begins a descent to the lowlands around the Wallkill River, a stretch surrounded by several horse farms. It draws alongside the Wallkill as it approaches a cluster of shipping warehouses along the south side of Interstate 84 (I-84). The river and the highway pass under the freeway with no connection, and NY 416 continues alongside the river while meandering past some more farmland as it enters the town of Montgomery. The river makes a turn to the west across the town line; however, NY 416 stays on a generally northward track to a restored slave cemetery situated on the west side of the highway. Another short stretch of fields brings NY 416 to its northern terminus at a junction with NY 211 just south of the Montgomery village line. This intersection is right next to Orange County Airport and two other historic sites. The Harrison Meeting House Site and Cemetery is on the east side of the road, and the Johannes Miller House lies across from it on the opposite side of NY 211. History The origins of NY 416 date back to 1902 when the state of New York awarded a contract on June 20 to improve of roads in Goshen and Hamptonburgh to state highway standards. The stretch cost $35,712 to reconstruct (equivalent to $ in ) and was added to the state highway system on August 5, 1904, as unsigned State Highway 65 (SH 65). SH 65 did not receive a posted route number until the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, when hundreds of state- maintained highways were given signed designations for the first time. The southern half of SH 65 became part of NY 207 while the northern part was designated as NY 416. Originally, NY 416 followed then-NY 84 northeast into Montgomery, where both routes terminated at NY 17K. In the mid-1960s, the NY 84 designation was eliminated to avoid confusion with the new I-84, and its former alignment east of Middletown became an extension of NY 211. NY 416 was truncated to its current length by 1970.

Frequent guests on many Japanese variety and quiz shows, they are probably most famous as guests on the former late night conte show Uchimura Produce (Uchi-P) and for their regular appearances on Lincoln. Along with Teruyoshi Uchimura and the rest of the show's former guests, they were two members of the musical comedy group NO PLAN, which was disbanded in 2006. Otake and Mimura The group consists of Kazuki ≈åtake (Â§ßÁ´π‰∏ÄÊ®π), born December 8, 1967, and Masakazu Mimura (‰∏âÊùë„Éû„Çµ„Ç´„Ç∫), born June 8, 1967. Both comedians were born in Sumida, Tokyo. Usually functioning as the boke, ≈åtake is famous for his ability to spontaneously spurt out meaningless, yet funny lines, and for his crude jokes (shimoneta). His amazing ability to entertain audiences with strange, nonsensical gags was dubbed \\"≈åtake World\\" on Uchi-P. He was told many times that he looked like his partner Mimura, and decided to wear glasses in order to distinguish himself. He does not, however, normally wear glasses. He enjoys wearing short sleeves over long sleeved T-shirts, and has been given the title \\"King of Sexual Harassment\\". As the tsukkomi of the group, Mimura is also known to perform tsukkomi on himself, and was given the nickname \\"Kant≈ç's #1 Tsukkomi King\\". He attempted to become a boke once on Uchi-P but couldn't pull it off as he continually resorted to using shimoneta. He is a prolific game show contestant, and once won ¬•1,000,000 on Quiz$Millionaire, the Japanese equivalent of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?. He is also considered a decent manga artist. Mimura is also a frequent target of dokkiri subjected on him by ≈åtake and the rest of the crew on Uchi-P. He jokes that he has become so accustomed to being surprised by dokkiri that he can predict when he is going to be fooled in the morning before he leaves his home to go to work. History As friends, ≈åtake and Mimura decided to become manzai-shi on a leisurely trip to Horipro in 1988. They began performing under the name \\"Bacardi\\", but in 2000, after numerous appearances on the \\"New Un- Nan's Feel So Nice\\" show, they were forced to change their name to \\"Summers\\" by Teruyoshi Uchimura. Cream Stew was also forced to change their name in the same way. Mimura's style of tsukkomi became famous--he frequently suffixes his sentences with kayo!, a very strong question form, comparable to the English, \\"The hell?\\"--and Summers has become increasingly successful ever since their big break in 2001. They also enjoyed moderate success with their books „Åï„Åæ„ÅÅ„Äú„Åö„ÅÆÊÇ≤„Åó„ÅÑ„ÉÄ„Ç∏„É£„É¨ (Summers' Sad Bad Dajare) and „Åï„Åæ„ÅÅ„Äú„Åö„ÅÆÊÇ≤„Åó„ÅÑ‰ø≥Âè• (Summers' Sad Haiku), published by Takarajimasha.

It covers an area of . History The ancient parish of Dry Drayton formed between the Roman Via Devana (now the A14) to the north, and the Cambridge to St Neot's road to the south, covering an area of 2421 acres. In 1966 around 350 acres were removed from the north west of the parish to create the new civil parish of Bar Hill. Now completely cleared of ancient woodland, the village has been used for arable farming for centuries. Listed as Draitone in the Domesday Book, the village became known as Dry Drayton by the start of the 13th century to distinguish it from Fen Drayton (5 miles to the north west) and the fact that it was susceptible to times of drought. The name \\"Drayton\\" means \\"farmstead where drays or sledges are used\\". Church Dry Drayton church The parish church in the village has been dedicated to St Peter and St Paul since the 15th century. The building dates from the 13th century, and consists of a chancel, an aisled and clerestoried nave with north porch, and a three- storey west tower. The tower is the oldest part of the present building and dates from the 13th century, as does the majority of the chancel and nave, though the church was restored in the 19th century. The plain octagonal font dates from the 13th century. Village life Dry Drayton village hall Dry Drayton has an Anglican church, a Methodist church, a primary school and a cricket ground.

Career Tsugawa was born January 2, 1940 in Kyoto, Japan. After acting as a child, he made his major debut at the age of 16 in the K≈ç Nakahira film Crazed Fruit in 1956. Tsugawa's family was heavily involved in the film industry since before his birth. Tsugawa attended school until dropping out of Waseda University Graduate School to pursue acting alone. He gradually grew in popularity by playing villan roles such television jidaigeki drama series as Hissatsu series and appeared in films like Otoko wa tsurai yo: Watashi no tora-san and Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack. He was eventually adopted as one of director Juzo Itami's favourite actors, and went on to appear in nearly every one of his movies since Tampopo. In television Tsugawa portrayed Tokugawa Ieyasu five times. He played Ieyasu in the 2000 Aoi Tokugawa Sandai and became the oldest actor who played a lead role in the Taiga drama. Tsugawa recently debuted as a director under the pseudonym Makino Masahiko with his film Nezu no Ban. He chose this name because he is the nephew of the Japanese director Masahiro Makino, his mother's brother. Legend has it that Tsugawa was so awed by the director while watching him at work as a young child that he asked if he could use Makino as his last name should he ever be a director, because of the similarities of the first names. Tsugawa comes from an illustrious film family. His older brother Hiroyuki Nagato was an actor. His wife Yukiji Asaoka was an actress. His grandfather is the director Sh≈çz≈ç Makino, his father, Kunitar≈ç Sawamura, and his mother, Tomoko Makino, were both actors. His aunt and uncle through his father are the actors Sadako Sawamura and Daisuke Kat≈ç. Tsugawa died August 4, 2018 due to heart failure. He was 78.

This station is on the West Highland Line.  History  The former station building, now a restaurant The station opened on 7 August 1894 and was laid out with two platforms, one on either side of a crossing loop. There are sidings on the north side of the station. The station buildings were designed by James Miller. Between 1903 and December 1933, there was a branch line from this station which offered service north up the Great Glen to Fort Augustus, terminating at a pier on Loch Ness. The North British railway extended Spean Bridge adding a dock platform at the west end at a cost of ¬£303 0s 5d () to accommodate Invergarry and Fort Augustus Railway trains. The signalling instruments were moved from the I&FA; box at the junction to the booking office at the insistence of the Board of Trade inspector. The I&FA; line was not successful. Passenger services stopped in 1933 and the line was eventually abandoned completely in 1947.\\"Disused Stations - Fort Augustus\\"Disused Stations Site Record; Retrieved 16 May 2016 The station was host to a LNER camping coach from 1936 to 1939. A camping coach was also positioned here by the Scottish Region from 1961 until all camping coaches in the region were withdrawn at the end of the 1969 season. On 18 January 1987, the crossing loop was altered to right-hand running. The original Down platform has thus become the Up platform, and vice versa. The change was made in order to simplify shunting at this station, by removing the need to hand-pump the train-operated loop points to access the sidings.  Signalling  From the time of its opening in 1894, the West Highland Railway was worked throughout by the electric token system. Alterations in connection with the construction of the line to Fort Augustus saw the original Spean Bridge signal box replaced by two new boxes in 1901. Spean Bridge Junction box was subsidiary to Spean Bridge Station box. The Junction box closed on 20 September 1921. The most recent signal box at Spean Bridge, which opened on 28 August 1949, was located on the Up platform (which is now the Down platform). It contained 30 levers. Spean Bridge lost all its semaphore signals on 2 March 1986, in preparation for Radio Electronic Token Block (RETB) signalling. The RETB system was commissioned by British Rail between and Fort William Junction on 29 May 1988. This resulted in the closure of Spean Bridge signal box and others on that part of the line. The RETB is controlled from a Signalling Centre at Banavie railway station. The Train Protection & Warning System was installed in 2003.

Rumsfeld was a case regarding the United States Armed Forces and their support of the Boy Scouts of America's national Scout jamborees. Every four years, the Boy Scouts of America holds a national Scout jamboree, where for ten days, approximately 30,000-40,000 Scouts camp out and participate in a wide variety of activities. At the time of the case, the US Department of Defense was the official host of the jamboree. From 1981 until 2010, the jamboree was held at Fort A.P. Hill, a US Army base in Virginia. The US Government spent an average of $2 million a year towards hosting of the jamboree. The Boy Scouts of America has always required all Scouts to agree to the Scout Oath which includes the phrase \\"To do my Duty to God\\". There have been several high-profile cases in which atheists and agnostics were removed from the organization for failing to agree to the Scout Oath. The American Civil Liberties Union brought suit on behalf of Chicago-area taxpayers Eugene Winkler, Methodist pastor, Gary Gerson, Reform rabbi, Timuel Black, teacher and civil rights activist, Douglas Ferguson and Mary Cay Marubio arguing that the Department of Defense's use of taxpayer money to fund the jamborees of what they called a private religious organization violates the First Amendment, which prohibits Congress from establishing a religion. In 2005, a U.S. District Court ruled that the DOD's spending on national Scout jamborees violates the Establishment Clause of the United States Constitution. The decision was subsequently reversed by the US Court of Appeals on April 4, 2007 in Winkler vs Gates (renamed due to a new Secretary of Defense), which ruled that the plaintiffs lacked legal standing as taxpayers to bring the suit in the first place. Therefore, the 2010 Jamboree at Fort A.P. Hill and future support by DOD of Jamborees continued as before. The case arose out of Winkler v. Chicago School Reform Board of Trustees, in which the plaintiffs sued the U.S. government and the city of Chicago. Background information The national Scout jamboree is a large gathering of Scouts held once every four years. Historically, jamborees were held in state and national parks like other groups' gatherings, but mutual concerns by BSA and the government over the environmental impact of 35,000 Scouts camping in heavily used public places led to a 1978 agreement to use infrequently used military facilities instead. The United States military used the jamboree as a large-scale training exercise for engineer, military police, and medical units. In addition, the military supported the jamboree through many different public relations and civilian support functions as well, as well as by teaching merit badges. While only registered Scouts and Scouters are allowed to camp at the jamboree, the exhibits and shows are open for the general public to visit and typically 300,000 persons visit a jamboree. From 1981 to 2010, the U.S. Army allowed the BSA to use Fort A.P. Hill in Virginia as the home of the national Scout jamboree, as authorized by Congress in 1972 through 10 U.S.C. 2554. As part of the 1978 agreement, BSA paid for capital improvements at Fort A.P. Hill (water lines, road improvements, amphitheater, etc.) that are used by both the jamboree and unrelated military encampments. BSA uses the facility for four weeks once every four years and it is available to the military and other members of the public for the rest of the time. The U.S. military regards the national Scout jamboree as beneficial for public relations and recruitment, and is a unique training opportunity, particularly in testing operations needed to support large-scale military encampments or refugee tent cities. The U.S. military has supported all of the national Scout jamborees since 1937. Most of the approximately $50 million jamboree expense is paid for by BSA and its participants. About 1,500 troops and DOD contractors are involved during the four weeks of a national jamboree operation. About half of them are involved in military training operations and half are involved in military public relations activities oriented towards the participants and visitors. Total Defense Department funding for these training and public relations activities averaged $8 million per jamboree. According to the government, \\"these funds were used to pay not only for services provided in support of the event itself, but also for the costs of transporting and billeting the population of soldiers brought to Fort A.P. Hill to perform services during the event.\\"DOJ appellant brief in Winkler v. Rumsfeld The BSA requires its members to promise to do their \\"duty to God\\", which excludes atheists from participating in jamborees as Scouts, but not as visitors. No Scout is required to participate in any religious ceremony at the Jamboree or elsewhere, but they have to repeat the Scout Oath. This policy has caused controversy and the federal government has been sued by people who claim that direct support of the BSA (such as funding or sponsoring Scouting units) violates the separation of church and state. A U.S. District Court Judge ruled in June 2005 that federal funding for the national Scout jamboree is unconstitutional because \\"the Boy Scouts are a religious organization, requiring Scouts to affirm a belief in God.\\" The U.S. Department of Justice appealed the ruling on behalf of the Secretary of Defense, arguing that the military‚Äôs support for the jamboree does not violate the separation of church and state on the grounds that BSA is not a religious organization, that the plaintiffs had no legal standing to bring the suit in the first place, and that visiting the Jamboree is open to the general public. After the June 2005 Federal District Court Judge's ruling, Congress enacted and the President signed the Support Our Scouts Act of 2005 on December 30, 2005 to indicate their desire for continued Defense Department support of the jamboree. The US Court of Appeals determined in April 2007 in Winkler vs Gates that the plaintiffs had no legal standing to bring the suit in the first place, thus ending the suit and affirming that the military may assist future jamborees, including providing campsites at Fort A.P. Hill. Reaction Although not an actual litigant in the proceedings, the BSA welcomed the decision, saying: > Boy Scouts of America is pleased that the United States Court of Appeals for > the Seventh Circuit dismissed the ACLU‚Äôs lawsuit against the Department of > Defense for supporting the National Scout Jamboree.

However, no such review was ever requested. Much of the issue became moot when the BSA announced in May 2008 that it was looking for a different permanent location for the national Scout jamborees, beginning with the one scheduled for 2013. The move was due to reasons outside of the lawsuit, including a more favorable summer climate, the ability to host a world jamboree, and off-year use as a high adventure base, along with the reduced need for the DOD to use the jamboree as a training opportunity due to recent operations in the Middle East. A site was found in Fayette County, West Virginia on private land. The Summit Bechtel Family National Scout Reserve will host all future national Scout jamborees, as well as serving as the BSA's fourth high adventure base.Welcome, Boy Scouts, MetroNews, Glen Jean, Fayette County However, future involvement of the military in supporting jamborees at The Summit is likely due to the recruiting and training opportunity it affords DOD.

They occur on every continent except for Antarctica. Around two hundred and fifty species of heterocerids are known to occur worldwide.Bamuel, 1995; Charpentier, 1965; Ivie, 1984; Mascogni, all works listed; Miller, all works listed; Pacheco, 1964, 1969; Skalick√Ω, all works listed They are most diverse in tropical and sub-tropical regions. Currently, 87 species are known from the New World,Bamuel, 1995; Ivie, 1984; Mascogni, 1988, 1989, 1994; Miller, all works listed; Pacheco, 1964, 1969 including 34 from the United States.Marske and Ivie, 2003 Variegated mud- loving beetles are brownish, dorsoventrally depressed shoreline inhabitants. Superficially they resemble small scarabs with the tibiae armed with rows of robust flattened spines. The beetles live in shallow tunnels that they dig in damp soil around fresh and brackish lakes, rivers and ponds. Heterocerids have been reported to live in intertidal sandflats, making them one of the few groups of coleopterans with marine representatives.Good, 1999 The uniform way in which they live seems to have favored the conservation of a \\"phenotypical uniformity in external morphology\\".Charpentier, 1965 Consequently, it is often quite difficult to identify one of these beetles to species relying on external morphology alone. Therefore, male genitalia are most often relied upon to identify species. Although few studies have been conducted on their ecology, heterocerids have been shown to be an important prey group for passerine birds and frogs (Schmidt et al., 2003; Turner, 1959), and they appear to play a significant role in seed dispersal and burial in sandy soils.Bernhardt, 1995 In the most recent revision of the family, Francisco Pacheco (1964) split the heterocerids into 20 different genera, erecting 17 new generic names based almost entirely on the features of male genitalia. Most systematists have found Pacheco's system complex and impractical because the ratio of genera to species is high and females cannot be identified. Consequently, his generic circumscriptions have not been widely accepted.see Arnett 2002 Taxonomy Thomas Say (1823) described Heterocerus pallidus and Heterocerus pusillus, the first New World species in the family. By the time George H. Horn (1890) produced his key to the genus Heterocerus, there were eleven described North American species in two genera. Horn's key relied heavily on general coloration and elytral pattern for species diagnosis. No other major taxonomic work concerning Heteroceridae was published until 1964, when Pacheco published his dissertation on the systematics, phylogeny and distribution of the family in the New World. Pacheco described 25 additional New World species. He produced worldwide (excluding Africa) identification keys based largely on characters of the male genitalia, leaving it impossible to identify females to species. Pacheco also split the heterocerids into 20 different genera, erecting 17 new generic names, once again relying heavily on characters of the male genitalia. Distribution maps are included in Pacheco's work; however, in his introduction, Pacheco admits that his work did not include enough material to create particularly informative distributions for many New World heterocerids. The only other monograph on the family Heteroceridae was published by Reinhold Charpentier (1965), and this encompassed the species of the Ethiopian region. Charpentier's work included two species level keys, one based on male genitalia, the other on external characteristics. Charpentier saw no justification in dividing the family into any new taxa and he retained all 35 Ethiopian species in the genus Heterocerus. He did note, however, the great difference between the male genitalia of various groups of species. Little subsequent taxonomic work was conducted with the family until the late 1980s, when W. V. Miller began describing species from around the world (Miller 1988, 1992). Miller's work included the descriptions of seven new species from North America. These additions brought the number of North American species to 34. A key to 21 northeastern species, produced by Miller, appeared in Downie and Arnett's Beetles of Northeastern North America (1995). This key relies mostly on elytral color patterns for species identification. In his work, Miller chose to apply a taxonomic scheme in which the heterocerids are divided into only five genera worldwide. European authors, namely S. Skalick√Ω (Czech Republic) and A. Mascagni (Italy), have described numerous species in the last ten years. The oldest fossils of the genus are from the Aptian of China and Mongolia, belonging to the genus Heterocerites.

History  The original station in 1957 The original station alongside the loch The first station was opened on 7 August 1894 by the West Highland Railway which was later absorbed by the North British Railway. It was sited further west of the present station on what is now the A82 town by-pass alongside Loch Linnhe at Station Square, at the time in close proximity to then location of the former Caledonian MacBrayne bus station. The old station was a stone built construction featuring a turret and a double arched entranceway and had three platforms. It closed on 9 June 1975 and was demolished immediately afterwards to permit construction of the bypass.Fort William re-sited The Railway Magazine issue 892 August 1975 page 377 The present Fort William station of grey concrete construction was opened on 13 June 1975. The current station lies in the shadow of Ben Nevis. The station is on the West Highland Line and the starting point for The Jacobite, a steam locomotive hauled passenger service to Mallaig. Refurbishment of the facilities at Fort William railway station was completed in 2007 thanks to a ¬£750,000 investment. The refurbishment includes new shower facilities and refurbished toilets. The shower facilities include two showers for ladies, two for gentlemen and one unisex shower facility for disabled people.

There is also a daily early morning service to Mallaig that starts at Fort William, with a similar return service in the evening (this connects into/out of the Caledonian Sleeper). The Caledonian Sleeper operates six nights per week (not Saturdays) from , starting/terminating at Fort William. The sleeper also carries seated coaches and can thus be used as a regular service train to/from Glasgow Queen Street and Edinburgh Waverley. The regular Sunday service consists of two train per day each way between Glasgow and Mallaig, with the schedule in the peak season supplemented by one service between Fort William and Mallaig. The Jacobite operates between Fort William and Mallaig, only stopping at . This runs through the summer until late October, with a maximum of two trains per day Monday to Saturday and one on Sunday in the high season. A reduced Jacobite timetable is operated later in the summer.  Signalling  Since its opening in 1975, the present Fort William station has been equipped with colour light signals. The signalling is controlled from an 'NX' (entrance-exit) panel in Fort William Junction signal box. The single line between the junction and the station is worked by the Track Circuit Block system, so no tokens are needed for that part of the route.

History  Banavie station opened along with the Mallaig Extension Railway on 1 April 1901. It comprises a single platform on the north side of the line. The station was host to a LNER camping coach from 1936 to 1939. Another station named \\"Banavie\\" existed above the Neptune's Staircase flight of locks that was renamed Banavie Pier railway station and closed to passengers in 1939.

Signalling  The swing bridge with signal box and station beyond From the time of its opening in 1901, the Mallaig Extension Railway was worked throughout by the electric token system. A signal box, named \\"Banavie Canal Bridge\\", was located at the west end of the station, on the north side of the line. It did not become a token station until 4 February 1912, but originally existed to control the nearby level crossings and the adjacent swing bridge over the Caledonian Canal. Because of the continuing requirement to operate the swing bridge locally, Banavie was chosen as the location for the control centre for the West Highland Line's new radio signalling system. Banavie signalling centre opened on 14 June 1987 when it replaced the old Canal Bridge signal box. The Radio Electronic Token Block signalling was commissioned on 6 December 1987. The control centre covers train movements as far south as Helensburgh and Oban and Mallaig to the west.

Eug√®ne de Rastignac is a fictional character from La Com√©die humaine, a series of novels by Honor√© de Balzac. He appears as a main character in Le P√®re Goriot (1835), and his social advancement in the post-revolutionary French world depicted by Balzac can be followed through Rastignac's various appearances in other books of the series. Rastignac is initially portrayed as an ambitious young man of noble, albeit poor, extraction who is at times both envious of and naive about high society. Although he is ready to do anything to achieve his goals, he spurns the advice of Vautrin (the series' dark criminal mastermind) and instead uses his own wits and charm (especially through relationships with women, such as his cousin Madame de Beaus√©ant) to arrive at his ends. His eventual social success in the fictional world of the Com√©die humaine is frequently contrasted with the tragic failure of another young parvenu in the series: Lucien de Rubempr√© (who accepts the aid of Vautrin and ends his life by his own hands). In French today, to refer to someone as a \\"Rastignac\\" is to call him or her an ambitious arriviste or social climber. Rastignac in La Com√©die Humaine The following list is organized with, first, the date on which Rastignac features, the title of the book in which Rastignac appears, followed by the date the book was written. Books which feature Rastignac as a main character, or which reveal something significant about his progress 1819 ‚Äì Le P√®re Goriot (1835) ‚Äì Rastignac is a 21-year-old student in Paris. He makes his first forays into high society (drawing on his family's resources to the full), is tempted by but rejects the machinations of Vautrin, and is confronted by cynicism and falseness in the people he meets. Initially desiring the Comtesse Anastasie de Restaud (daughter of Father Goriot), he is persuaded to become the lover of her sister Delphine (wife of the Baron de Nucingen, a wealthy Alsatian) by his cousin the Vicomtesse de Beauseant, who has a greater insight into Parisian life and acts as his patron. Goriot approves of Rastignac as Delphine's lover and sues Nucingen to give her control over her dowry. Delphine then sets up Rastignac in a furnished establishment. At Goriot's death, Rastignac is among the few who attend his funeral, and from the heights of P√®re Lachaise Cemetery he looks down on the French capital and makes his famous proclamation \\"√Ä nous deux, maintenant!\\" (\\"It's between you and me now!\\") 1828 ‚Äì L'Interdiction (1836) ‚Äì In some unexplained manner Rastignac now has an annual income of 20,000 francs. This is less than it could have been as he was \\"thoroughly done ... in that Nucingen business\\". He has not forgotten the sacrifices of his family and has arranged marriages for his sisters, presumably by supplying adequate dowries. Rastignac is thinking of leaving Delphine for the Marquise d'Espard, who has the sort of power that will help him to advance. 1833 ‚Äì Les Secrets de la Princesse de Cadignan (1840) ‚Äì Rastignac is Under-Secretary of State to Prime Minister de Marsay. His cleverness is illustrated in the way he wins over Daniel d'Arthez by allowing funeral honours for Michel Chrestien. His relationship with Delphine is given as an example during a discussion on long- standing attachments. It appears that Rastignac had an affair with the Duchesse de Maufrigneuse at some earlier stage. 1834 ‚Äì Une t√©n√©breuse affaire (1841) ‚Äì Rastignac appears as one of the people to whom a denouement is made, 30 years after the narrated events occurred. He is still Under-Secretary of State in the ministry of de Marsay, who is now close to death. 1834-1835 ‚Äì Une Fille d'Eve (1835) ‚Äì Rastignac is hoping to succeed the dying de Marsay as prime minister. De Marsay's party does not stay in power after his death, and Rastignac is forced to rely on Raoul Nathan, despite Nathan's being a political opponent. When Nathan emerges as an electoral rival to du Tillet, Rastignac changes sides and does not warn Nathan of du Tillet's plans to bankrupt him (via Gigonnet). Rastignac is easily persuaded to reveal the plot when the Comte de Vandenesse promises to support Rastignac's claim to the peerage. On the personal side, Rastignac's younger brother (previously unmentioned) has been made a bishop at 27, and one of his sisters is married to Martial de la Roche-Hugon, a government minister. Rastignac and Delphine appear to have plans for his marriage to her daughter. 1833 and 1836 ‚Äì La Maison Nucingen (1838), frame story ‚Äì During a conversation between four journalists, the reader learns that in 1833 Rastignac broke his relationship with Delphine de Nucingen, but that he is still working with her husband, especially in his more fraudulent financial deals (Rastignac has earned 400,000 francs and has 40,000 francs of annual interest revenues). In 1836, he is on his way to becoming a governmental minister and becoming a peer of France. 1839 ‚Äì Le D√©put√© d'Arcis (1847, unfinished) ‚Äì Rastignac is minister for the second time (of Public Works), he has been made Comte (ranking as a peer of France), his brother-in-law Roche-Hugon is now an ambassador and Councillor of State (equivalent to senator), and he is regarded as indispensable to the government. \\"After 20 at hard labour\\" Rastignac has recently married the daughter of Delphine and Baron de Nucingen (their only child, and thus the inheritor of their vast fortune). Rastignac is admired for his ability to convert political opponents. He is also the numbers man for his party: although expecting defeat in the coming general elections, he schemes to secure the rotten borough of Arcis to strengthen his party when in opposition. Rastignac's scheme fails and, despite unexpectedly remaining in power, he resorts to underhanded methods to discredit the new member for Arcis, Charles de Sallenauve (n√©e Marie-Gaston). This includes pressuring de l'Estorade to connive in falsehoods, despite owing the life of his daughter to Sallenauve. A contrast is made between the fortunes of Rastignac and de Trailles, which are now the complete opposite of what they were when they first met in Pere Goriot. The following problem may be due to the book having been finished by another person: Given the chronology set out above, it is not clear when Rastignac could have been a minister for the first time. It is possible that the finisher has mistakenly counted Rastignac's previous position as Under-Secretary of State as his first ministry. Comments made by Raoul Nathan in Une Fille d'Eve make it clear that this is not the case. 1845 ‚Äì Les Com√©diens sans le Savoir (1845) ‚Äì Rastignac is 48. The caricaturist Bixiou says of him: \\"he has 300,000 francs of annual interest revenues, is a Peer of France, the king has made him Comte, he is the son-in-law of Nucingen, and he's one of the two or three men of State who were brought into being by the July Revolution... but power burdens him sometimes...\\" Other books in which Rastignac appears or is mentioned 1820 ‚Äì Le Bal de Sceaux (1829) ‚Äì Rastignac does not appear personally, but is suggested as a possible husband. In rejecting him, Emilie says meaningfully \\"Madame de Nucingen has made a banker of him\\". 1821-1822 ‚Äì Les Illusions Perdues (1836-1843) ‚Äì Rastignac appears as one of the dandies that Lucien aspires to emulate. As a clever and skillful social climber, Rastignac knows both how to use people and how to eliminate his competition. 1822-1824 ‚Äì Le Cabinet des Antiques (1837) ‚Äì Rastignac appears as one of the dandies that Victurnien d'Esgrignon falls in with during his sojourn in Paris. 1823 ‚Äì √âtude de femme (1835) ‚Äì A short anecdote narrated by Bianchon. Rastignac is described as \\"one of those extremely clever young men who try all things, and seem to sound others to discover what the future has in store\\". The anecdote describes a series of errors committed by Rastignac and attributes them to his inexperience. The woman in question is the Marquise de Listomere, n√©e Vandenesse. The date is problematic: Rastignac is 25; however the Morea expedition (commenced 1828) is discussed. 18?? ‚Äì Autre Etude de Femme (1842) ‚Äì 1824-1830 ‚Äì Splendeurs et mis√®res des courtisanes (1838-1847) ‚Äì Rastignac appears at the start (on Lucien's return to Paris) and at the end (at Lucien's funeral). 18?? ‚Äì Un M√©nage de Gar√ßon also titled La Rabouilleuse (1842) ‚Äì 1829 ‚Äì Ursule Mirouet (1842) ‚Äì Rastignac appears as one of the dandies whom Savinien de Portenduere falls in with during his sojourn in Paris. 1829-1831 ‚Äì La Peau de Chagrin (1831) ‚Äì Rastignac appears indirectly when Raphael de Valentin narrates his life to Emile Blondet. Rastignac's friendship and support for Raphael is vastly different from his treatment of Lucien. Although both are talented and poor, Raphael is a Marquis and cousin to the Duc de Navarrein. Rastignac was planning to marry a rich widow, but changes his mind when he finds that her income was only 18,000 francs and she had an extra toe. 1838-1846 ‚Äì La Cousine Bette (1847) ‚Äì Rastignac does not appear personally, but is so influential that he is among the first people considered when the Hulot family seek to have Wenceslas Steinbock's artistic talents recognised.

The parish includes the village of Bayworth and the eastern part of Boars Hill. The parish was part of Berkshire until the 1974 boundary changes transferred it to Oxfordshire. The 2011 Census recorded the parish population as 904. Toponym In 9th-century Saxon charters Sunningwell's place-name is spelt Sunnigwellan and Sunningauuille. The Domesday Book of 1086 records it as Soningeuell. The name is derived from Old English, meaning \\"the spring of Sunna's people\\". Manor The Domesday Book records that Abingdon Abbey held the manors of Sunningwell and Bayworth by 1086, and it assessed Sunningwell manor at five hides. The manor retained both manors until 1538, when it surrendered all its properties to the Crown in the Dissolution of the Monasteries. In 1545 the manors of Sunningwell and Bayworth were granted to Robert Browne (a goldsmith), Christopher Edmondes and William Wenlowe. They seem to have been speculators who bought them for a quick profit, as they alienated the manors in 1546. The buyer was John Williams, later Baron Williams of Thame. Baron Williams died in 1559 without a male heir, and the manors passed to his elder daughter Margery and her husband Henry Norris, 1st Baron Norreys. In 1583 Margery sold Sunningwell and Bayworth to her younger sister Isabel and her second husband Richard Huddleston. By 1589 Richard and Isabel were dead and had left the two manors mortgaged to a Richard Martin. In 1597 Martin sold the manors to the Elizabethan general Sir Thomas Baskerville, but he died on campaign in Picardy that year so he probably never lived there. The two manors passed to Sir Thomas's son Hannibal Baskerville (1597‚Äì1668), grandson Thomas Baskerville and great-grandson Matthew Baskerville, all of whom lived at Bayworth. Matthew Baskerville died in 1720‚Äì21 with no legitimate heir, but during his lifetime he had sold Sunningwell and Bayworth in return for an annuity of ¬£80 to Sir John Stonhouse, lord of the manor of Radley. Sunningwell and Bayworth remained with the Stonehouse family and their successors the Bowyers until about 1884, when an Edgar John Disney of Ingatestone in Essex foreclosed a mortgage on the manor. He retained the manor for the rest of his life, but his son Edgar Norton Disney sold most of it in 1912. Parish church The oldest known record of the Church of England parish church of St Leonard is from 1246. The nave and parts of the chancel date from this time, and there is one blocked 13th-century window in the south wall of the nave. The east end of the chancel was rebuilt late in the 13th or early in the 14th century with a Decorated Gothic east window. Late in the 15th century the Perpendicular Gothic south transept and north tower were built and the nave was given Perpendicular Gothic windows and an embattled parapet. The Elizabethan polygonal west porch with Ionic columns is said to have been given by John Jewel, Bishop of Salisbury, who had been rector of Sunningwell St Leonard's in about 1551. Samuel Fell was rector of St Leonard's from 1625 to 1649. The west tower has a ring of six bells. Henry II Knight of Reading cast the tenor in the Commonwealth era in 1653. Charles and George Mears of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast the second, third, fourth and fifth bells in 1857. Mears and Stainbank, also of the Whitechapel foundry, cast the treble bell in 1933. In 1877 St Leonard's was restored under the direction of JP Seddon, a friend of William Morris, who designed the stained glass in the east window. The church is a Grade II* listed building.

Today it is fully owned by Daimler AG. The \\"smart\\" production site in Hambach (France) with its 2,000 workers is among the most modern automobile production plants. It has been built for 450 million Euros and has started production in 1998. In order to achieve optimized production processes the plant is arranged in the shape of a cross; in each of its four extensions different assembly works are provided. The centre, the so-called market place, serves as a test room for completed vehicles and for refinishing operations. The centre is multi-storied; thereby all the administrative, IT and changing rooms could be implemented in one central place. The factory was officially opened in 1997 in the presence of Jacques Chirac and Helmut Kohl. The decision to locate the plant in French Hambach rather than the Black Forest site in Lahr (which had also been seriously evaluated) was made for several reasons. Lorraine and the region around Hambach were shaped by the heavy industry in former times. With the decay of this economic branch a considerable proportion of the population became unemployed. From the EU funds for economically underdeveloped regions as well as from the French government appropriations for an industry settling were available that would not have been provided in Lahr. The high unemployment provided the advantage of a high labor potential for a substantial new manufacturing plant. The Hambach site was closer to the Autoroute than the Lahr site would have been, though both sites are well served by Autobahn connections. Finally pivotal were the vast area reserve and the lower wage level in Lorraine. Calculations resulted in 75 Euros lower production costs for one Smart at the French production site than on the German site. Modern Toyota-inspired production philosophy also necessitated a large surrounding land area so that key suppliers could have their own assembly or warehousing facilities on the same site as the Smart plant. Smart is the company with the lowest in-house production depth in the automobile sector. It accounts only for 10%, most other manufacturers often still have 20‚Äì40%. This means that 90% of the production steps to the complete car are performed by component suppliers. To bring this concept to perfection, most of the suppliers were settled with their own production sites around the \\"Smart\\" plant in Hambach. The auto body manufacturer Magna International produces the chassis from parts that are delivered from the Daimler plant in Sindelfingen. Siemens VDO produces the entire cockpit, the cable trees and the batteries. ThyssenKrupp Automotive delivers the entire propulsion unit. The tire sets are delivered by Continental. The delivery of entire modules is also called Modular Sourcing. The buildings for the component suppliers were built and provided by the company Smart in order to facilitate plant construction for component suppliers at the location. The Smart-assembly is implemented without any stock-keeping, all parts are delivered just-in-time and even just-in- sequence; this means that all component suppliers have access to the individual order data of every vehicle and that they deliver the parts in exactly the order as is required in the Smart-plant. Since Smart produces vehicles only on order, the completed vehicles, too are stored for few days only before they are delivered into the particular smart-Centers via a company-owned railway station. After the vehicles have been completed their proper operation is verified in several tests, for example an engine test, a gasket test, and on a shake test track. Possible problems during production are solved by 50 employed maintenance specialists. The closeness of component suppliers allows for the maintenance of delivered parts by the particular outside companies. Work is done in two shifts in which one vehicle has a throughput time of 8 ¬Ω hours; the final assembly takes 4 ¬Ω hours. The production capacity is at about 750 units per day. To keep the motivation of the workers on a high level eight of them at a time are organized in teams. These teams have a relatively flat hierarchy. Every week the production is halted for a quarter of an hour to allow the teams for a reflection. Furthermore, through the participation system \\"Eureka\\", all personnel have the opportunity to turn in suggestions for improvement concerning the production flow or of common nature. The best ideas are awarded with a bonus. Even the tidiness of the particular sections of the individual teams is recorded and awarded. In July 2020, the Daimler AG has announced its interest to sell the factory.FAZ.net References Further reading * Tom Warhol, Green Cars, smart car.

A napkin holder can be made from virtually any solid material and is built so that the napkins do not slip from its hold, either by way of sandwiching them between two surfaces, or simply enclosing them on their sides in a horizontal design. Napkin holders range in price and styles from wooden designs to wrought iron or ceramic styles and many others. One iteration of the napkin holder, better known as a napkin dispenser, offers additional functionality with its design: folded napkins are enclosed in a snug metal casing, allowing users to retrieve a single napkin each time they reach into the container; this particular device is usually found in restaurants, diners, and other public eateries, while its simpler--often more aesthetically pleasing--counterpart, the holder, is common to households and classrooms. There is also an item which holds a napkin or serviette in a button hole or the top of a conventional necktie knot. It is conjectured as a clamp for the corner of a napkin and an hook which hooks into the top of the tie knot. They are most usually in sterling silver and date back to at least Edwardian times. Hence often to be found in antique outlets as functional collectors items. Certain \\"gentleman's clubs\\" include a button hole in a corner of their napkins for direct coupling to an upper shirt button. Function The outward pressure from a full load of napkins helps keep them between the two outer walls of the holder Napkin holders, as their name implies, are tools in which napkins are held and stored, most often sandwiched between two surfaces. Among basic holders, there are several kinds, those principally belonging in two categories; vertical and horizontal. While their main function is to hold napkins, napkin holders can also serve to complement decorations, either internally or externally. In addition, the creation of napkin holders by amateur woodworkers and metalworkers serves as a fairly easy project, and has been touted by do it yourself magazines such as Popular Mechanics and Popular Science. Even simpler designs have been sold as projects that children can do, the napkin holders in these being made of paper plates and yarn. Napkin holders are used in many locations, ranging from classrooms to eateries. History The popularity of napkin holders corresponded with the invention (and popularization) of the paper napkin by the Scott Paper Company in 1930, although cloth napkins had existed-often as handkerchiefs-since Greek and Roman times. Wrought iron napkin holders and rings were a common part of a blacksmith's repertoire during the 19th century as well as other holders and household items. Mechanically made napkin holders have replaced many of those made by hand, as blacksmithing is now primarily an art form, as opposed to a means of creation of household utility items. Vintage napkin holders left Vintage napkin holders were an integral part of kitchens during the 1950s, 60s, and 70s. Made in large quantities, these napkin holders were often made of brightly colored plastic, either transparent or solid. Other non-plastic napkin holders were also produced, but in smaller quantities. Design A horizontal napkin holder with a weight to hold napkins down and edges The two main styles of napkin holders, vertical and horizontal, function in similar ways. Vertical napkin holders and some horizontal napkin holders sandwich napkins between two surfaces. In vertical napkin holders, the surfaces tend to be the same size and, often, shape, making the napkin holders symmetrical. In vertical holders that sandwich, however, the bottom is usually around the size of a conventional paper napkin, about by while the top side can be any virtually any shape, as it acts as a paperweight. Within this style, there is variation. Some napkin holders have edges as the weight alone could not keep the napkins down (see photo), while others rely entirely on their weight to secure the napkins. Another type of horizontal holder lacks a weight altogether, and is simply a base and four edges. The design of napkin holders is largely based upon preconditions of the space or spaces that the napkin holder will occupy. For example, if limited table space is available, a vertical design may be more practical. However, if conserving space is not an issue, a horizontal napkin holder is advantageous, as well as slightly easier for the subject to access. Color, style, and durability are also based on the environment and the architectural styles of the selected room or rooms. Lastly, price and budget are determining factors of a napkin holder's design, which usually range between 10 and 50 US dollars. Construction Metal and combination metal/wood napkin holders While the basic design of napkin holders is consistent, the tools and construction materials will vary based on what material the maker is using. Wood While less common than metal or wrought iron napkin holders, wooden napkin holders are often made as art projects, due to the relative ease of making them, and easy access to the materials needed. Common materials used in wooden napkin holder construction include: *Hardwood or plywood for extra strength and durability. *Brad nails. *Wood glue. Metal Metal napkin holders may be made from wrought iron, wire, or sheet metal. Napkin dispensers A wide napkin dispenser The variant of the napkin holder, the napkin dispenser, is most often seen as a part of restaurant equipment. Napkin dispensers serve in restaurants not only because they are easy to access, but more importantly because they provide diners with autonomy from the restaurant staff, so if a spill or other accident occurs, the diners can clean it up on their own, which frees the burden from waiters and other busy members of the staff.

Confusingly, the first part of the series, O Continente, was translated as Time and the Wind, giving the impression that it is the whole work. Plot introduction The series tells the story of two families - Terra and Cambar√° -, and how they evolve through 200 years of history, from 1745 to 1945. Living in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, in southern Brazil, both families experience the transformations of the country. The books The saga is composed of three books, divided in total by seven volumes: * O Continente (2 volumes) * O Retrato (2 volumes) * O Arquip√©lago (3 volumes) Major themes The trilogy tells the story of a traditional family that lives through transformations of the society, so not only the story of that particular family is explored, but also the historical process that took place in that part of Brazil, as in the whole country. Throughout the narrative, historical wars, revolutions, political crises and events are depicted and the characters are part or affected by them. It's also noticeable that the families depicted to the book (ultimately family, since at a point they are joined by marriage) also go through transformations, departing from poverty in the beginning of the saga, until gaining economic and political prosperity through marriage. Ultimately, the Terra-Cambar√° family becomes part of a land-owning elite. Plot summary O Continente The first book, entitled O Continente (The Continent), progresses in non-linear chapters. There are seven chapters entitled \\"O Sobrado\\" that frame the rest of the action and tell the story of a siege to the Terra-Cambar√° mansion during the Federalist Revolution. Between these chapters, the history of the family is told chronologically, since its beginnings up to the time of the siege. =Chapters= { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" - valign=top  *O Sobrado I (The Townhouse I) *A Fonte (The Fountain) *O Sobrado II (The Townhouse II) *Ana Terra (Ana Terra - name of one novel's character) *O Sobrado III (The Townhouse III) *Um certo Capit√£o Rodrigo (A Certain Captain Rodrigo) *O Sobrado IV (The Townhouse IV)  *A teiniagu√° (The Teinagu√° - indigenous name of a folklore character) *O Sobrado V (The Townhouse V) *A Guerra (The War) *O Sobrado VI (The Townhouse VI) *Ism√°lia Car√© (Ism√°lia Car√© - - name of one novel's character) *O Sobrado VII (The Townhouse VII) } O Retrato O Retrato (The Portrait) is a portrait in flashback of Rodrigo Terra Cambar√°, a fictional member of the real government of Get√∫lio Vargas, as a young man. Dr. Rodrigo arrives to his home town of Santa F√© after studying Medicine in Porto Alegre. Initially, he contrasts with his family: his brother Toribio and his father Licurgo are countryside men while Rodrigo listens to operas, reads magazines from Paris, and drinks champagne. Ultimately, however, as he takes his first steps in politics, he exhibits many of the personality traits and vices that will follow him for life. The title of this book refers to a portrait of Rodrigo Cambar√° painted by a friend of the doctor, Don Pepe Garcia. The Spanish painter wants to portrait his friend as vigorous and powerful as he is, and when he finishes he states this painting was his masterpiece. In a clever reference to The Picture of Dorian Gray, by Wilde, Rodrigo himself starts a fast decay into savagery and brutality, ending up sick in bed (since the first chapter of the book is set in 1945, we already know that by the start), while his Picture remains just as it was painted to remind him of the man he once was. = Chapters = The first (Rosa-dos- Ventos) and the last (Uma Vela para o Negrinho) chapters are set in 1945, the present days, showing Dr. Rodrigo back to Santa F√© after the fall of Brazilian's dictator Get√∫lio Vargas (whom he supported) suffering from a terminal disease. The other two work as flashbacks, telling stories of the man's early adulthood. * Rosa-dos-Ventos (Wind Rose) * O Chantecler (The Chanticleer) * A Sombra do Anjo (The Shadow of the Angel) * Uma Vela para o Negrinho (A Candle to the Negrinho - the name of a folklore character) O Arquip√©lago In O Arquip√©lago (The Archipelago), after the fall of the Vargas dictatorship, terminally ill, Dr. Rodrigo Terra Cambar√° returns to Santa F√© with his fractured family. In flashbacks and conversations, his days as a revolutionary and as a politician in Rio de Janeiro are remembered, just as the remaining members of the decadent family - particularly his son Floriano, a key part of this metafictional novel - try to rebuild their lives free from the influence of the dying patriarch. Main characters O Tempo e o Vento features a huge cast of characters. Most of the notable characters belong to Terra and Cambar√° families. Some of the most notable are: * Ana Terra, a strong woman rejected by her family after having a son out of wedlock with the character Pedro Missioneiro, a former indigenous member of the Jesuits missions. Ana is one of the founders of the fictional city of Santa F√©. * Captain Rodrigo Cambar√°, a happy, picaresque man of arms, eventually settles in Santa F√© when he marries Bibiana Terra (Ana Terra's granddaughter), thus forming the Terra Cambar√° family. He died while trying to take over the very Santa F√© where he lived in during the Ragamuffin War. * Licurgo Terra Cambar√°, long-living patriarch of the family and political leader of his city and grandson to Captain Rodrigo Cambar√° and Bibiana Terra. Married his cousin Alice Terra. Killed in action during the revolution of 1923. * Maria Val√©ria Terra (Dinda, or Godmother), single strong and independent woman who lives in the Townhouse since his sister Alice married Licurgo. In the second and third books, she takes over the role of Bibiana as the great matriarch of the family, quiet but extremely wise. * Dr. Rodrigo Terra Cambar√°, son of Licurgo and grandson to Captain Rodrigo, takes over his father's role as political leader. Fights in the successful revolution that took Get√∫lio Vargas to power, thus granting him a high position in the federal government. By nature a bon vivant and a liberal, he abandons his political convictions for the conveniences granted to him by his continued support of the Vargas government as it develops into a violent, long populist dictatorship. * Floriano Terra Cambar√°, older son of Dr. Rodrigo, an introspective writer who is an alter-ego of the very Erico Verissimo, writer of O Tempo e o Vento. Allusions and references to history O Tempo e o Vento is a historical novel. As such, many of its supporting characters and most of the historical events actually existed. This included, most notably, the Ragamuffin War and the Vargas dictatorship, and the political leaders Borges de Medeiros, Pinheiro Machado, Flores da Cunha, J√∫lio de Castilhos, Lu√≠s Carlos Prestes and many others. All of the revolutions are real, as are the wars of colonial Brazil against Spanish Argentina and the Paraguayan War. The city of Santa F√© and the Terra Cambar√° family are entirely fictional. While the history of Santa F√© is typical of many other cities and towns in the Southern of Brazil, specially Cruz Alta, where Verissimo grew up, the Terra Cambar√° family is not based on any historical family in particular.

For administrative purposes it is part of the parish of Waterbeach. The population of the hamlet was included in the civil parish of Bottisham at the 2011 Census. The village lies on the Ely Road (A10) between Waterbeach and Stretham. It has one pub, Paraiso Restaurant (formerly The Traveller's Rest). Another small settlement, Elford Closes, lies to the north of Chittering. History Situated towards the southern end of The Fens, the marshes in the Chittering area were first settled in Roman times. Investigations around Causeway End Farm in Chittering Fen show evidence of dwellings and inclosed fields that were occupied from the early 2nd to the early 4th century. Denny Abbey, just to the south of the hamlet, was built in around 1150. The fenland around Chittering has been known as North Fen since at least the 14th century. Over the following centuries it was gradually divided into smaller areas, and Chittering Fen ‚Äì so named by the early 15th century ‚Äì covered an area of around by the 19th century and was principally used for growing hay. A school was built in the village to accommodate 54 children in 1877, but numbers had declined to only 19 by the start of the Second World War. The school closed in 1969. The former micro-brewery, the City of Cambridge Brewery (originally located in Cheddars Lane, Cambridge), used a reedbed system to deal with its waste water, but brewing ceased on the site in 2007 and the remaining assets were sold off in 2011.

The objective of a protection scheme is to keep the power system stable by isolating only the components that are under fault, whilst leaving as much of the network as possible still in operation. Thus, protection schemes must apply a very pragmatic and pessimistic approach to clearing system faults. The devices that are used to protect the power systems from faults are called protection devices. Components Protection systems usually comprise five components: *Current and voltage transformers to step down the high voltages and currents of the electrical power system to convenient levels for the relays to deal with *Protective relays to sense the fault and initiate a trip, or disconnection, order *Circuit breakers to open/close the system based on relay and autorecloser commands *Batteries to provide power in case of power disconnection in the system *Communication channels to allow analysis of current and voltage at remote terminals of a line and to allow remote tripping of equipment. For parts of a distribution system, fuses are capable of both sensing and disconnecting faults Failures may occur in each part, such as insulation failure, fallen or broken transmission lines, incorrect operation of circuit breakers, short circuits and open circuits. Protection devices are installed with the aims of protection of assets and ensuring continued supply of energy. Switchgear is a combination of electrical disconnect switches, fuses or circuit breakers used to control, protect and isolate electrical equipment. Switches are safe to open under normal load current (some switches are not safe to operate under normal or abnormal conditions), while protective devices are safe to open under fault current. Very important equipment may have completely redundant and independent protective systems, while a minor branch distribution line may have very simple low-cost protection. Alexandra Von Meier (2013). Electrical Engineer 137A: Electric Power Systems. Lecture 14:Introduction to Protection Systems, Slide 3. A digital (numeric) multifunction protective relay for distribution networks. A single such device can replace many single-function electromechanical relays, and provides self- testing and communication functions. Types of protection High-voltage transmission network Protection on the transmission and distribution system serves two functions: protection of plant and protection of the public (including employees). At a basic level, protection disconnects equipment which experiences an overload or a short to earth. Some items in substations such as transformers might require additional protection based on temperature or gas pressure, among others. Generator sets In a power plant, the protective relays are intended to prevent damage to alternators or to the transformers in case of abnormal conditions of operation, due to internal failures, as well as insulating failures or regulation malfunctions. Such failures are unusual, so the protective relays have to operate very rarely. If a protective relay fails to detect a fault, the resulting damage to the alternator or to the transformer might require costly equipment repairs or replacement, as well as income loss from the inability to produce and sell energy. Overload and back-up for distance (overcurrent) Overload protection requires a current transformer which simply measures the current in a circuit and compares it to the predetermined value. There are two types of overload protection: instantaneous overcurrent (IOC) and time overcurrent (TOC). Instantaneous overcurrent requires that the current exceeds a predetermined level for the circuit breaker to operate. Time overcurrent protection operates based on a current vs time curve. Based on this curve, if the measured current exceeds a given level for the preset amount of time, the circuit breaker or fuse will operate. The function of both types is explained in . Earth fault/ground fault  Earth fault protection also requires current transformers and senses an imbalance in a three-phase circuit. Normally the three phase currents are in balance, i.e. roughly equal in magnitude. If one or two phases become connected to earth via a low impedance path, their magnitudes will increase dramatically, as will current imbalance. If this imbalance exceeds a pre-determined value, a circuit breaker should operate. Restricted earth fault protection is a type of earth fault protection which looks for earth fault between two sets of current transformers (hence restricted to that zone). Distance (impedance relay) Distance protection detects both voltage and current. A fault on a circuit will generally create a sag in the voltage level. If the ratio of voltage to current measured at the relay terminals, which equates to an impedance, lands within a predetermined level the circuit breaker will operate. This is useful for reasonably long lines, lines longer than 10 miles, because their operating characteristics are based on the line characteristics. This means that when a fault appears on the line the impedance setting in the relay is compared to the apparent impedance of the line from the relay terminals to the fault. If the relay setting is determined to be below the apparent impedance it is determined that the fault is within the zone of protection. When the transmission line length is too short, less than 10 miles, distance protection becomes more difficult to coordinate. In these instances the best choice of protection is current differential protection. Back-up The objective of protection is to remove only the affected portion of plant and nothing else. A circuit breaker or protection relay may fail to operate. In important systems, a failure of primary protection will usually result in the operation of back-up protection. Remote back-up protection will generally remove both the affected and unaffected items of plant to clear the fault. Local back-up protection will remove the affected items of the plant to clear the fault. Low-voltage networks The low-voltage network generally relies upon fuses or low-voltage circuit breakers to remove both overload and earth faults. Cybersecurity The bulk system which is a large interconnected electrical system including transmission and control system is experiencing new cybersecurity threats every day. (‚ÄúElectric Grid Cybersecurity,‚Äù 2019). Most of these attacks are aiming the control systems in the grids. These control systems are connected to the internet and makes it easier for hackers to attack them. These attacks can cause damage to equipment and limit the utility professionals ability to control the system. Coordination Protective device coordination is the process of determining the \\"best fit\\" timing of current interruption when abnormal electrical conditions occur. The goal is to minimize an outage to the greatest extent possible. Historically, protective device coordination was done on translucent log‚Äìlog paper. Modern methods normally include detailed computer based analysis and reporting. Protection coordination is also handled through dividing the power system into protective zones. If a fault were to occur in a given zone, necessary actions will be executed to isolate that zone from the entire system. Zone definitions account for generators, buses, transformers, transmission and distribution lines, and motors. Additionally, zones possess the following features: zones overlap, overlap regions denote circuit breakers, and all circuit breakers in a given zone with a fault will open in order to isolate the fault. Overlapped regions are created by two sets of instrument transformers and relays for each circuit breaker. They are designed for redundancy to eliminate unprotected areas; however, overlapped regions are devised to remain as small as possible such that when a fault occurs in an overlap region and the two zones which encompass the fault are isolated, the sector of the power system which is lost from service is still small despite two zones being isolated.Glover J. D., Sarma M. S., Overbye T. J. (2010) Power System and Analysis 5th Edition. Cengage Learning. Pg 548-549. Disturbance-monitoring equipment Disturbance-monitoring equipment (DME) monitors and records system data pertaining to a fault. DME accomplish three main purposes: * model validation, *disturbance investigation, and *assessment of system protection performance. DME devices include: *Sequence of event recorders, which record equipment response to the event *Fault recorders, which record actual waveform data of the system primary voltages and currents *Dynamic disturbance recorders (DDRs), which record incidents that portray power system behavior during dynamic events such as low frequency (0.1 Hz ‚Äì 3 Hz) oscillations and abnormal frequency or voltage excursions Performance measures Protection engineers define dependability as the tendency of the protection system to operate correctly for in-zone faults. They define security as the tendency not to operate for out-of-zone faults. Both dependability and security are reliability issues. Fault tree analysis is one tool with which a protection engineer can compare the relative reliability of proposed protection schemes. Quantifying protection reliability is important for making the best decisions on improving a protection system, managing dependability versus security tradeoffs, and getting the best results for the least money. A quantitative understanding is essential in the competitive utility industry. E. O. Schweitzer, J. J Kumm, M. S. Weber, and D.

Without this reliability, systems may cause costly damages. *Selectivity: Devices must avoid unwarranted, false trips. *Speed: Devices must function quickly to reduce equipment damage and fault duration, with only very precise intentional time delays. *Economy: Devices must provide maximum protection at minimum cost. *Simplicity: Devices must minimize protection circuitry and equipment. Reliability: Dependability vs Security There are two aspects of reliable operation of protection systems: dependability and security. NERC Reliability Fundamentals of System Protection, December 2010, Sec 3 - 4.1.2.3, https://www.nerc.com/comm/PC/System%20Protection%20and%20Control%20Subcommittee%20SPCS%20DL/Protection%20System%20Reliability%20Fundamentals_Approved_20101208.pdf Dependability is the ability of the protection system to operate when called upon to remove a faulted element from the power system. Security is the ability of the protection system to restrain itself from operating during an external fault. Choosing the appropriate balance between security and dependability in designing the protection system requires engineering judgement and varies on a case by case basis.

Fronted by singer-songwriter and bassist Rob Zabrecky, the group's neo-new wave pop and post punk style first appeared among a string of early independently released 7 inch singles and on their self-titled debut on Interscope Records in 1993. Zabrecky's lyrical content often described love lost and slacker life in Los Angeles. History Formed in 1989 by college and high school friends Zabrecky, Celso Chavez, and Bryan Kovacs (drums and percussion) the group took their name from a suspected murderer mentioned on television show America's Most Wanted. Initially performing as a trio, they mixed haphazard punk-folk compositions with store-front theatre to some measurable success, primarily performing at LA art/coffeehouses (Bebop Records & Fine Art, Jabberjaw, Pik-Me-Up). The following year, longtime friends and former schoolmates Robert O‚ÄôSullivan (guitar/organ/keyboards) and Rich Truel (drums) were enlisted and together a fuller musical range was explored. Chronicling their hometown's east side slacker life with a pop-rock sensibility, the band incorporated influences from the Talking Heads, Human Hands, Wall of Voodoo, Dream Syndicate and Camper Van Beethoven. By 1992 Possum Dixon had logged a number of mini-tours and produced a number self- released 7 inch singles and cassettes which included \\"Music for a One Bedroom Apartment\\", \\"Nerves\\", \\"Watch the Girl Destroy Me\\", and a three single box-set released by Pronto Records. Along the way a strong following was built and eventually the band found themselves part of a flowering art-infused, indie and coffeehouse scene in Los Angeles.First Spaceland Show Featuring Possum Dixon, Beck and Foo Fighters Secretly rehearsing by night in a warehouse (where Zabrecky worked as a mailroom clerk by day), hiding their equipment with boxes when they finished, the band diligently polished club-tested material and assembled what would become their first full length major label debut. The band had a helping hand from Beck, who would frequently get up on stage before the band played to test his latest material. Zabrecky later recorded a bass track on Beck's first Geffen release, Mellow Gold. In 1993 the band signed to Interscope Records, based on the strength of their live performances and briefcase of club proven material. They sought the record producer Earle Mankey, and when the album was released, radio stations picked up \\"Watch the Girl Destroy Me\\". Aided by a steady flow of both radio airplay and MTV airplay (the song's hit video), the track hit No. 9 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart in the U.S. Spin magazine remarked: :\\"Zabrecky's new wave-noir vignettes are littered with overheard conversations, chattering radios, lucky numbers, and visitors from other planets - the markings of one man's attempt to make some sense out of postmodern chaos.\\" The band embarked on a tour schedule throughout the United States and Europe, headlining and supporting groups such as the Dead Milkmen, The Lemonheads, Reverend Horton Heat, and Violent Femmes. During the sessions, the band replaced drummer Rich Truel with Byron Reynolds, who had served a brief tenure on drums prior to Truel. The band chose Boston producer Tim O'Heir (Sebadoh, Folk Implosion, Superdrag) to capture the band's dark, moody, new wave-ish emotions. The LP was an array of influences of 1970s power pop to no-wave chaos, and again the critics were positive. Raygun magazine described the group as \\"a rough-yet polished band whose anguished pop songs and intelligent, esoteric lyrics are love themes for the dysfunctional 90s.\\" After a touring schedule, the band released two EPs: Sunshine or Noir and Tropic of Celso. They also contributed a song to 1997's We Are Not DEVO cover album. Around this time Robert O'Sullivan quit to pursue other interests. What was to be their third and final effort, New Sheets, was released in 1998. During the process, the band enlisted the help of longtime friend and guitarist Matt Devine, and the production of The Cars singer- songwriter Ric Ocasek, who found clarity in a clean and sober Zabrecky. Go- Go's guitarist Jane Wiedlin also provided backup on the song \\"Faultlines.\\"New Sheets Article in Billboard Ultimately this produced an album that was more The Cars than Possum Dixon, and overshadowed what the group was best known for. Following the release, the group broke up. Founding guitarist Celso Chavez died on May 9, 2012, due to complications from pneumonia.

It is on the West Highland Line. Glenfinnan Viaduct is about to the east of the station.  History  Glenfinnan station opened on 1 April 1901. The station has two platforms, one on either side of a crossing loop. There are sidings on the south side of the station. The station was host to a LNER camping coach from 1936 to 1939. A camping coach was also positioned here by the Scottish Region from 1952 to 1962, the coach was replaced in 1963 by a Pullman camping coach which was joined by another Pullman in 1967 until all camping coaches in the region were withdrawn at the end of the 1969 season. The station was extensively refurbished in summer 2007.  Signalling  From its opening in 1901 the Mallaig Extension Railway was worked throughout by the electric token system. Glenfinnan signal box, which had 15 levers, was at the east end of the Down platform, on the south side of the line. Glenfinnan signal box On 13 November 1983, the method of working from Glenfinnan to became One Train Working (with train staff). Electric token block was reinstated to on 29 April 1984, but One Train Working continued to be used when Arisaig token station was switched out. The Arisaig - Mallaig train staff would then be padlocked to the Glenfinnan - Arisaig key token. Glenfinnan lost its semaphore signals on 13 April 1986, in preparation for Radio Electronic Token Block (RETB) signalling. RETB was commissioned between Mallaig Junction (now Fort William Junction) and Mallaig on 6 December 1987. This resulted in the closure of Glenfinnan signal box (amongst others). The RETB is controlled from a Signalling Centre at Banavie railway station. The Train Protection & Warning System was installed in 2003.  Glenfinnan Station Museum  The Glenfinnan Station Museum is located in the station building, on the Down platform. The museum's exhibits focus on the construction, impact and operation of the Mallaig Extension Railway in the late 19th century. The restored booking office includes the original tablet instruments and, again since early 2012, various artefacts specific to the local area. There is also a changing exhibition of railway photography and a gift shop. The museum is open seasonally. During 2011 and early 2012, the entire Museum site underwent extensive refurbishment. This included major work to the Original Signal Box; a new external staircase, repairs to cladding and a reference theatre/teaching space installed. The main station building underwent alterations to meet current access requirements and new weather proofing on the roof. Ongoing work includes rebuilding the link path between the Station and Glenfinnan Viaduct, site of filming for several Harry Potter films, and expansion of the museum archives.  Services  Glenfinnan is visited by The Jacobite steam trains in summer, and regular trains throughout the year. There are four trains per day to and three to Glasgow Queen Street plus a fourth to that connects with the overnight Caledonian Sleeper to London Euston on weekdays. On Sundays there are three trains per day each way in summer, but just one in winter.GB eNRT 2015-16 Edition, Table 227 (Network Rail) See also *Lech-a-Vuie Platform railway station  References   Notes   Sources    Further reading  * *  External links  * Glenfinnan Station Museum - official site * RAILSCOT on Mallaig Extension Railway Category:Lochaber Category:Category B listed buildings in Highland (council area) Category:Listed railway stations in Scotland Category:Railway stations in Highland (council area) Category:Former North British Railway stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1901 Category:Railway stations served by Abellio ScotRail Category:Museums in Highland (council area) Category:Railway museums in Scotland Category:James Miller railway stations Category:1901 establishments in Scotland ","title":"Glenfinnan railway station"},{"id":"4242017","text":"Lochailort railway station is a railway station serving the village of Lochailort in the Highland Council area in Scotland.

Permanent Court of International Justice (ser. A/B) no.63, p.83. This right is now also codified as Article 87(1)a of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Not all UN member states have ratified the convention; notably, the United States has signed, but not ratified the convention. However, the enforces the practice; see below. History  Development as a Legal Concept  Freedom of navigation as a legal and normative concept has developed only relatively recently. Until the early modern period, international maritime law was governed by customs that differed across countries‚Äô legal systems and were only sometimes codified, as for example in the 14th-century Catalan Consulate of the Sea (; ; also known in English as the Customs of the Sea). These customs were developed and employed in local jurisprudence, often cases in prize courts regarding the capture of goods on the high seas by privateers. Under the Consolato customs (and other contemporary codes), \\"enemy goods can be captured on neutral ships and neutral goods are free on board enemy's ships.\\" This established a framework under which neutral shipping was not inviolable in time of war, meaning navies were free to attack ships of any nation on the open seas, however the goods belonging to neutral countries on those ships, even if they were enemy ships, were not to be taken. This legal custom, which hereafter will be referred to as the consolato rule, was long observed by England (later Great Britain), France, and Spain, as major naval powers.Atherley-Jones, pp. 284-285 However, as time went on and maritime trade, travel, and conquest by the major European naval powers began extending beyond European waters, new ideas regarding how to govern the maritime realm began to emerge. Two main schools of thought emerged in the 17th century. The first, championed most famously by John Selden, promoted the concept of mare clausum, which held that states could limit or even close off seas or maritime areas to access by any or all foreign ships, just as areas of land could be owned by a state, limiting foreign activity there.Selden, John, Nedham, Marchamont, and Howell, James. Mare Clausum: The Right and Dominion of the Sea in Two Books. Printed for Andrew Kembe and Edward Thomas, 1663. Other notable supporters of this idea included John Burroughs and William Welwod.Welwod, William. An Abridgement of All Sea-lawes : Gathered Forth of All Writtings and Monuments, Which Are to Be Found among Any People or Nation, upon the Coasts of the Great Ocean and Mediterranean Sea (Reprod.) / by William Welwod,... Printed by Humfrey Louves (London), 1613. In the larger geopolitical context, mare clausum was backed by the major naval and colonial powers of the day, including Spain and Portugal. As these powers extended their reach to the New World and across Africa and Asia, they wished to consolidate control over their new empires and access to trade and resources there by denying other countries access to the sea routes leading to these areas. By quite literally closing off access to the seas using their naval muscle, these states would profit handsomely from the growing maritime trade routes and foreign colonies. Meanwhile, the Dutch Republic, the dominant European trade carrier, championed a different rule, known as mare liberum (free seas), summarized as \\"a free ship [makes] free goods.\\" This meant that even enemy goods, always excepting contraband, were inviolate in neutral bottoms (i.e. hulls), making neutral ships off-limits for attack on the high seas. For the Dutch Republic, this was essential in order to secure the safety and viability of their extensive trade network. This concept was coined by Hugo Grotius, a Dutch jurist and a founding father of international law. Grotius advocated for a shift in maritime norms that would make the high seas free for transport and shipping, regardless of the country of origin of the ship. This would represent not only a change in law, but also a fundamental shift in the perception of the maritime realm as something not to be owned, as land is, but rather as a shared resource. Behind this concept is a liberal view of sovereign equality, in which all states have equal access to the high seas, and a view of an interdependent world connected by the sea.Wolfrum, R√ºdiger. ‚ÄúThe Freedom of Navigation: Modern Challenges Seen from a Historical Perspective‚Äù in Castillo, Lilian del, and Caminos, Hugo, eds. 2015. Law of the Sea, from Grotius to the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea: From Grotius to the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. Leiden: BRILL. As the dominant naval powers of Spain and Portugal weakened, and international trade increased, Grotius‚Äô mare liberum concept would come to be the accepted custom governing sovereignty at sea.Scovazzi, Tullio. ‚ÄúThe Origin of the Theory of Sovereignty of the Sea‚Äù in Castillo, Lilian del, and Caminos, Hugo, eds. 2015. Law of the Sea, from Grotius to the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea: From Grotius to the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. Leiden: BRILL.  From Concept to Custom to Law  Freedom of navigation came to be embodied in bilateral treaties to become part of what would today be called international law. The earliest example of such a treaty is one concluded between King Henry IV of France and the Ottoman Porte in 1609, followed in 1612 by one between the Porte and the Dutch Republic. Once the Eighty Years' War between Spain and the Dutch Republic had ended during which Spain defended their claim of sovereignty over the oceans against the Dutch claim of \\"freedom of the high seas,\\" as developed in Hugo Grotius' Mare Liberum, the two concluded a treaty of commerce in which \\"free ship, free goods\\" was enshrined. The Dutch Republic subsequently concluded bilateral treaties with most other European countries, containing the \\"free ship, free goods\\" principle, sometimes resorting to the use of force to obtain that concession, as against England in the Treaty of Breda (1667) and again in the Treaty of Westminster (1674). England, however, also held fast to the consolato rule in relations with other countries, as did France, until in 1744 it relented and extended the privilege to the neutral Dutch.Atherley-Jones, pp. 286-287 The Dutch eventually established a web of bilateral treaties that extended the privilege of \\"freedom of navigation\\" to their ships through much of Europe. During the many 18th-century European wars they remained neutral, serving all belligerents with their shipping services. Great Britain, in particular, chafed under the arrangement, as it was the dominant naval power in the 18th century, and the Dutch privilege undermined the effectiveness of its naval blockades. Matters came to a head during the War of the American Revolution, when the Dutch, shielded by the 1674 Anglo-Dutch treaty, supplied both the Americans and the French. The British made extensive use of their \\"right of search\\" of Dutch ships, which led to the Affair of Fielding and Bylandt by which a British naval squadron, in peacetime, arrested a Dutch convoy despite the objections of its Dutch naval escort. Soon afterward, the British abrogated the 1674 treaty, which might have meant the death of the \\"free ship, free goods\\" doctrine, but Empress Catherine II of Russia had taken up the torch around the same time. In March 1780, she published a manifesto in which (among other things) she claimed the \\"free ship, free goods\\" principle, as a fundamental right of neutral states. To defend that principle, she formed the First League of Armed Neutrality to which the Dutch adhered at the end of the year (which sparked the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War). The principles from her manifesto were soon adhered to by the members of the League and by France, Spain and the new American Republic also (even if, as belligerents, they could not become members of the League).Atherley-Jones, pp. 288‚Äì289 Nevertheless, as a principle of international law (apart from treaty law) \\"free ship, free goods\\" was soon again overturned by the practice of both sides in the French Revolutionary Wars of the turn of the 19th century. For instance, in the jurisprudence of the American courts of the early 19th-century, the consolato principle was universally applied in cases not covered by treaties. On the other hand, the US government made it a steadfast practice to enshrine the \\"free ship, free goods\\" principle in the treaties of amity and commerce it concluded with other countries (starting with the 1778 one with France and the 1782 one with the Dutch Republic). In other words, the American view (following the British practice) was that at that time consolato was customary international law, which, however, could be superseded by treaty law on a bilateral basis. The US, however, earnestly strove for the substitution of consolato by \\"free ship\\" in customary law also.Atherley-Jones, pp. 283‚Äì284 That state of affairs came about when Britain finally gave up its resistance to the principles, first formulated by Empress Catherine in 1780, and acquiesced in the 1856 Paris Declaration Respecting Maritime Law, which enshrined \\"free ship makes free goods\\" and rejecting \\"enemy ship makes enemy goods.\\" The Declaration was signed by the major powers (except the US) and it was soon adhered to by most other powers. The new rule (a combination of the \\"best\\" parts of Consolato and \\"free ship\\") became that a \\"neutral flag covers enemy's goods (except contraband); neutral goods are not liable to seizure under the enemy's flag.\\"Atherley-Jones, p. 298 While the concept as a whole became accepted international custom and law, the practice and implementation of freedom of navigation would during these years be developed through local jurisprudence and political decision-making.Rothwell, Donald, Kaye, Stuart, Akhtarkhavari, Afshin, and Davis, Ruth. \\"Law of the Sea.\\" In International Law, 501-55. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010.Shaw, Malcolm N. \\"The Law of the Sea.\\" In International Law, 490-571. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003. While local jurisprudence differed, usually a consensus view emerged over time. A key example is the issue of territorial waters. While there was agreement that a certain expanse of the seas from a state's shorelines would be under stricter state control than the high seas, the exact distance this control would extend from the shoreline was debated. However, over time through local governance and jurisprudence a general agreement emerged that territorial waters would extend three leagues or three miles from the shoreline. This norm- and custom-formation continued for centuries within the frame of mare liberum.Pinto, M.C.W. ‚ÄúHugo Grotius and the Law of the Sea‚Äù in Castillo, Lilian del, and Caminos, Hugo, eds. 2015. Law of the Sea, from Grotius to the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. Leiden: BRILL. The UNCLOS and the modern understanding of freedom of navigation in international law This culminated in 1982, when freedom of navigation became part of the broader body of laws of the sea currently embodied in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Article 87 of this convention explicitly codifies this concept, stating ‚ÄúThe high seas are open to all States, whether coastal or land-locked‚Äù and lists ‚Äúfreedom of navigation‚Äù as the first of several rights for all states on the high seas.UN General Assembly, Convention on the Law of the Sea, 10 December 1982. The drafting of UNCLOS clearly was in line with Grotius‚Äô ideas of sovereign equality and international interdependence. All states were given a voice in the drafting of the convention, and the convention only came into effect with the consent and ratification of the party states. Implementation of UNCLOS connects the party states together across the shared space of the high seas. Freedom of Navigation as formulated in the UNCLOS, was a trade-off between the developed and the developing world. Where the developed world had an interest in a maximum of their freedom to sail and explore the seas the developing world wanted to protect their offshore resources and their independence. In other words, it was a conflict between understanding the seas through the principle of mare liberum that asserts the oceans to be open to all nations or mare clausum that advocates that the seas should be under the sovereignty of a state. The UNCLOS upheld freedom of navigation on the high seas but also invented different zones of sovereignty that limited the rules of foreign ships in these waters with concepts like internal waters and Economic Exclusive Zones (EEZ). Additionally, navigation rights of warships were guaranteed on the high seas with complete immunity from the jurisdiction of any state other than the flag state. The UNCLOS introduced a number of legal concepts that allowed freedom of navigation within and outside of the maritime jurisdictions of countries. These are right of innocent passage, right of transit passage, right of archipelagic sea lanes passage and freedom of the high seas. The right of innocent passage allows ships to travel in other countries territorial seas if it is not prejudicial to the peace, good order or security of the costal state. However, some countries like China requires warships to attain prior authorization before they enter Chinese national waters.Gill, Munraj. ‚ÄúThe Issue of Freedom of Navigation in the Asia- Pacific Region: The Rights and the Interest of Costal States and Practices.‚Äù The Journal of Defence and Security 7.1 (2016): 66‚ÄìIII. Transit passage refers to passage through straits used for international navigation between one part of the high seas or an EEZ and another with more relaxed criteria for passage. The passage must be continuous and expeditious transit of the strait. With archipelagic sea lanes passage archipelagic states may provide sea-lanes and air-routes passage though their waters were ships can enjoy freedom of navigation.  American Adherence to Freedom of Navigation  See also United States and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea As previously noted, American advocacy for freedom of navigation extends as far back as a 1778 treaty with France, enshrining freedom of navigation as a legal custom on a bilateral level. In the 20th century, Woodrow Wilson advocated for freedom of navigation, making it Point 2 of his Fourteen Points (see Freedom of the seas). The US has not ratified the 1982 UNCLOS treaty,Robertson, Horace B. Jr. ‚ÄúThe 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea: An Historical Perspective on Prospects for US Accession‚Äù in Carsten, Michael D., ed. International Law and Military Operations. Newport, R.I: Naval War College, 2008. but it is a party to the preceding 1958 Convention on the High Seas. Despite its failure to formally ratify UNCLOS, the US now considers UNCLOS to be part of customary international law, and has committed to adhering to and enforcing the law.Clingan, Thomas A. \\"Freedom of Navigation in a Post-UNCLOS III Environment.\\" Law and Contemporary Problems 46, no. 2 (1983): 107-23.  Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOPs)  FONOPs are closely linked to the concept of freedom of navigation, and in particular to the enforcement of relevant international law and customs regarding freedom of navigation.Galdorisi, G. (1996). The United States freedom of navigation program: A bridge for international compliance with the 1982 United Nations convention on the law of the sea? Ocean Development & International Law, 27(4), 399-408. The drafting of UNCLOS was driven in part by states‚Äô concerns that strong national maritime interests could lead to excessive maritime claims over coastal seas, which could threaten freedom of navigation.Kraska, James, and Pedrozo, Raul A. International Maritime Security Law. Leiden: Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 2013. FONOPs are a method of enforcing UNCLOS and avoiding these negative outcomes by reinforcing freedom of navigation through practice, using ships to sail through all areas of the sea permitted under UNCLOS, and in particular those areas that states have attempted to close off to free navigation as defined under UNCLOS and international law and custom. FONOPs are a modern operational reinforcement of a norm that has been strengthening for nearly four hundred years. Freedom of navigation has been thoroughly practiced and refined, and ultimately codified and accepted as international law under UNCLOS, in a legal process that was inclusive and consent-based. FONOPs are outgrowths of this development of international law, based on sovereign equality and international interdependence. United States Freedom of Navigation Program The US Department of Defense defines FONOPs as ‚Äúoperational challenges against excessive maritime claims‚Äù through which ‚Äúthe United States demonstrates its resistance to excessive maritime claims.‚ÄùUnited States Department of Defense. 2018. ‚ÄúDepartment of Defense Report to Congress Annual Freedom of Navigation Report Background.‚Äù https://policy.defense.gov/Portals/11/Documents/FY18%20DoD%20Annual%20FON%20Report%20(final).pdf?ver=2019-03-19-103517-010. The United States has an institutionalized FONOPs program called the Freedom of Navigation Program, which undertakes many FONOPs around the world every year. The program publishes annual reports chronicling each year's FONOPs, and a listing of relevant foreign maritime claims. The United States Freedom of Navigation (FON) program challenges what the U.S. considers to be excessive territorial claims on the world's oceans and airspace. The position of the United States is that all nations must obey the international law of the sea, as codified in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.Joint Statement of the U.S.-ASEAN Special Leaders‚Äô Summit: Sunnylands Declaration , White House Office of the Press Secretary (February 16, 2016): \\"Shared commitment to ...ensuring maritime security and safety, including the rights of freedom of navigation and overflight and other lawful uses of the seas, and unimpeded lawful maritime commerce as described in the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) ... The U.S. Department of State writes: The American position is somewhat complicated by the fact that the U.S. is not a party to UNCLOS. U.S. armed forces have conducted FONOPs in areas claimed by other countries but considered by the U.S. to be international waters, such as naval operations in the Gulf of Sidra in the 1980s;James Gerstrenzang, U.S. Navy Ends Maneuvers in Gulf of Sidra , Los Angeles times (March 28, 1986). as well as in strategically important straits (such as Gibraltar, Hormuz, and Malacca).Nilufer Oral, Transit Passage Rights in the Strait of Hormuz and Iran's Threats to Block the Passage of Oil Tankers , Insights, Vol. 16, American Society of International Law (May 3, 2012). One of the notable operations conducted as innocent passage and part of Freedom of Navigation programCampbell, \\"USS Caron‚Äôs Black Sea Scrape Furthered International Law, National Interest\\", The Virginias-Pilot and The Ledger Star, June 12, 1988, at C3, col. 1. was performed by USS Yorktown, during which, on February 12, 1988 she was \\"nudged\\" by Soviet frigate Bezzavetnyy in an attempt to divert the vessel out of Soviet territorial waters.  Freedom of Navigation and Warships  A particular characteristic of many FONOPs, and in particular American FONOPs, is that they are undertaken by vessels of a national navy. This brings to the fore a hot debate over whether freedom of navigation extends to military vessels. Most notably, Chinese legal scholars and government policymakers argue that the right of freedom of navigation given to civilian vessels in foreign waters does not apply to military vessels. Because of this, some countries including China requires warships to attain prior authorization before they enter Chinese national waters. Given such understandings of freedom of navigation, US and other country's FONOPs undertaken with military vessels could be viewed as provocative or even bellicose. Other scholars have pointed out that the UNCLOS does not specifically mention freedom of navigation for warships outside of the high seas but that it has been practice between states to accept military activities at least within the EEZ.  Innocent Passage vs. FONOPs  The concept of innocent passage in international law and under UNCLOS refers as noted earlier to the right of a vessel to pass through the territorial waters of a foreign state under certain conditions. While related to FONOPs in that both innocent passages and FONOPs involve vessels traversing seas claimed by a foreign state, they differ in that if a vessel claims it is traversing under innocent passage terms, it implies a concession that the vessel is in fact traveling through territorial waters of another state.Rothwell, Donald R.; Bateman, W. S. Walter Samuel Grono (2000-11-14). Navigational Rights and Freedoms, and the New Law of the Sea. Martinus Nijhoff Publishers. . Both innocent passage and FONOPs challenge a state's imposed limitations on freedom of navigation in a maritime area, but innocent passage accepts that the area is within a state's waters, while a FONOP can be used to challenge a state's territorial claim to an area.  Criticism  There are many critics of FONOPs, with a wide breadth of criticisms regarding the efficacy, bellicosity, and legality of FONOPs. One group of critics argues that FONOPs are unnecessarily risky and lead to escalation. Chinese government responses to American FONOPs in the South China Sea fall under this category of criticism.Swaine, Michael D. 2010. ‚ÄúChina‚Äôs Assertive Behavior‚ÄîPart One: On ‚ÄòCore Interests.‚Äô‚Äù Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. November 15, 2010. https://carnegieendowment.org/2010/11/15/china-s-assertive-behavior- part-one-on-core-interests-pub-41937. A second group of critics argue that FONOPs are unnecessary, and that states should focus on the protection of their own ships rather than using ship operations to check other states' maritime claims. Still other critics argue that FONOPs are ineffective at their goal of limiting other states' maritime claims. FONOPs in the South China Sea Chinese territorial claims (red line), 2010shttp://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/48951000/gif/_48951920_south_china- sea_1_466.gif China's claims to large areas of the South China Sea are not recognized by the international community. According to BBC correspondents, the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea could potentially be a major geopolitical flashpoint. China has used land reclamation to expand disputed islands, and has built runways on them. U.S. FONOPS in the South China Sea In 2013 and 2014, the US conducted FONOPs in areas claimed by China, Taiwan, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam. During the presidency of the Obama administration there was an increase in attention on China and Asia in general leading to the pivot to Asia from 2012. This also was reflected in an increased number of FONOPs in the South China Sea. In 2015 the Obama administration authorized two FONOPs and three FONOPs were authorized in 2016.Larter, David B. ‚ÄúIn challenging China‚Äôs claims in the South China Sea, the US navy is getting more assertive‚Äù.

The FONOP came shortly after the Pentagon announced that it would disinvite the Chinese navy for its Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) exercise off Hawaii the same summer, which is a US flagship naval exercise. The FONOP was called a ‚Äúserious infringement on China‚Äôs sovereignty by China‚Äôs defense ministry. On September 30, 2018, the USS Decatur was undertaking a FONOP near the Gaven and Johnson Reefs in the Spratly Islands when a Chinese destroyer, the Lanzhou, approached to within 41 meters of the USS Decatur, in what the US Navy termed ‚Äúa series of increasingly aggressive maneuvers‚Äù This forced the Decatur to maneuver to avoid a collision. In December 2018 China deployed naval forces to warn off the USS Chancellorsville while it made a FONOP around the Paracel Islands without approval of the Chinese government. ‚ÄúThe Southern Theatre Command organized navy and air forces to monitor the US vessel, and gave warning for it to leave,‚Äù a statement by the Southern Theatre Command said in response to the U.S FONOP.Ng, Teddy. ‚ÄúChinese navy sent to confront USS Chancellorsville in latest South China Sea stand-off‚Äù.

The U.S FONOPs has continued into 2020. The U.S Navy conducted its first FONOP in 2020 on January 25 by sending the littoral combat ship Montgomery past Chinese claims in the Spratly Islands. During the FONOP China sent two fighter-bombers scrambling overhead to intimate the USS Montgomery, according to Chinese state media. The January 25 patrol was officially aimed at China, Taiwan and Vietnam. Specifically, the Navy challenged the notion that innocent passage through claimed territorial waters requires previous notification. On April 28, 2020 the Japan-based guided-missile destroyer USS Barry conducted a freedom of navigation operation in the vicinity of Paracel Island chain off Vietnam.LaGrone, Sam. ‚ÄúChina Says PLA Scrambled Aircraft, Ships to ‚ÄúExpel‚Äù U.S. Warships from South China Sea Island Chain‚Äú.

In May 2017, Japan sent an and two destroyers on a three-month tour of the South China Sea, where they conducted exercises with an . This was Japan's biggest foray into the region since the Second World War. In April 2018, three Australian naval vessels transited the South China Sea towards Vietnam and, along the way, met a 'robust' challenge from the Chinese navy. At the June 2018 Shangri-La Dialogue, ministers from France and the UK jointly announced that their ships would sail through the South China Sea to continue to uphold the collective right to freedom of navigation. The announcement came after the UK and France announced separately in July 2017 and May 2018 respectively that they would increase their involvement in the South China Sea. The Royal Navy also conducted what is believed to be a FONOP with , a 22,000-ton amphibious transport dock, in late August 2018 in the waters near the Paracel Islands.

He played for three teams, the New England Patriots, New York Jets, Miami Dolphins during his seven-year career from 1996 to 2002. He is currently a studio analyst for the show Jets Nation on New York City-based sports network SportsNet New York. Early life Lucas was born while his father, Tom, was serving in Vietnam. Professional career Early career Lucas spent most of his career in the NFL in a backup role. During the 1999 NFL season, after quarterback Vinny Testaverde was injured in the first game of the season, Rick Mirer took the helm, winning four of ten games. Lucas took over afterward and lost his first two starts but won his next four games to give the Jets an 8‚Äì8 record for the season. Lucas was a favorite player of Bill Parcells during Parcells' time in New England and with the Jets, and was one of the players Parcells eventually brought over from the Patriots to the Jets. Parcells introduced Lucas in 1997 by putting him in at quarterback with second string QB Neil O'Donnell lined up at wide receiver. Lucas set up in a shotgun formation and ran the ball himself for 15 yards, befuddling the Vikings defense in a play that eventually led to a Jets victory. He attempted his first NFL pass in Week 17 of 1997 against the Detroit Lions. Lucas went 3 of 3 for 28 yards before throwing an interception. He was also called for a personal foul when making the tackle on the interception return. Lucas started in the Jets' 1999 preseason opener against the Green Bay Packers, and Parcells had him in the running for the starting and second-string quarterback role during that season. After starting QB Vinny Testaverde was injured later that season, Lucas started several games. Later career Following his success with the Jets, Lucas spent the 2001 and 2002 seasons with the Miami Dolphins. As the team's backup quarterback, he didn't see much playing time during the 2001 season (only having three pass attempts), but during the 2002 season Lucas got an opportunity to start six games. Due to his large size, he was also the quarterback of choice during goal-line and some red zone situations. The Dolphins began the 2002 season 5-1, but after then starting quarterback Jay Fiedler broke his thumb during a Monday night game against Denver, Lucas was trusted to quarterback the Dolphins for the next six games. During those games, Lucas amassed 4 touchdowns, 6 interceptions, and a 69.9 QB rating. Lucas holds the unenviable distinction of worst single game quarterback performance by any Dolphin. On October 20, 2002, in one game against the Buffalo Bills, Lucas was responsible for 6 turnovers: 4 interceptions and 2 fumbles. He completed only 13 passes to Dolphin receivers. The player that caught the most passes from Lucas was Buffalo Cornerback Nate Clements.NFL Game stats for October 20, 2002 Miami Dolphins v. Buffalo Bills Post-career On March 28, 2008, Lucas was named to the Hudson County Sports Hall of Fame.Lucas Named to Hudson County (NJ) Sports Hall of Fame In 2014, Lucas co-wrote the book Under Pressure: How Playing Football Almost Cost Me Everything and Why'd I'd Do It All Again.

Opened by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in 1990, the camp is home to more than 12,000 refugees from Liberia who fled their country during the First Liberian Civil War (1989-1996) and the Second Liberian Civil War (1999-2003), in addition to refugees from Sierra Leone who escaped from their civil war (1991‚Äì2002).Anna Boiko-Weyrauch, Future of Liberian Refugees in Ghana Uncertain , voanews.com, 3 December 2009 The camp is served by Liberian and international NGO groups and volunteer organizations. The Carolyn A. Miller Elementary School provides free education to nearly 500 children in the camp. The UNHCR began pulling out of the camp in April 2007, slowly withdrawing all UNHCR-administered services. June 2010 was the official cessation of refugee status for the refugees in the settlement. Buduburam, located in Ghana, was established in 1990 to accommodate the influx of Liberian refugees who fled to Ghana when Charles Taylor came to power. Initially, the UNHCR provided the settlement's residents with individual aid and relief. In 1997 Liberia held elections that the UN judged to be fair enough to allow for safe repatriation conditions. As a result, the UNHCR discontinued refugee assistance to Liberians in Ghana, and the settlement lost much of its funding. During this time, an estimated 3,000 refugees returned to Liberia. Most chose to remain in Ghana, and the Buduburam settlement served as the center of their community. Soon after the 1997 elections, the political situation in Liberia worsened, and fresh arrivals of Liberian refugees to Ghana led the UNHCR to return to Buduburam. Although the UNHCR limits its personal aid efforts in the settlement to unaccompanied minors, the elderly, and the disabled, the organization does sponsor infrastructure work within the community, funding projects such as construction and education. Now host to over 42,000 refugees, most of whom are Liberian, the settlement still receives new refugees on a regular basis. In February 2011, the Deputy Minister of Information in Ghana indicated that Buduburam is no longer needed and that the inhabitants should consider returning to Liberia or settling elsewhere in Ghana. Canadian footballer Alphonso Davies was born in Buduburam in 2000 before moving to Edmonton, Canada at the age of five.

This station is a terminus on the West Highland Line, by rail from and from Glasgow Queen Street.  History  The station in 1966 The station in 1973 Mallaig station opened on 1 April 1901. The station was laid out as an island platform with tracks on either side. There were sidings on both sides, and a turntable to the south of the station, on the west side of the line, right beside the sea. Until 1968 two tracks continued down onto the pier, which was built and originally owned by the West Highland Railway Company. The tracks were removed when the harbour passed from British Rail ownership to that of the Mallaig Harbour Authority. The glass overall roof was removed in 1975 and the ticket office was extended at the same time.  Services  A train to Glasgow The Jacobite at Mallaig Station The Skye ferry at Mallaig harbour Scheduled train services out of Mallaig railway station are operated by Abellio ScotRail. Currently, four trains a day depart Monday to Saturdays from Mallaig for Fort William, three of which continue to Glasgow (the fourth connects at Fort William with the Caledonian Sleeper to London Euston). On Sundays three trains depart Mallaig for Fort William, with two trains continuing on to Glasgow.GB eNRT 2016 Edition, Table 227 (Network Rail) The railway line from Mallaig is noted as a scenic route, especially as it passes along the Glenfinnan Viaduct out of Mallaig. Mallaig is also the destination of a special tourist steam train operated by West Coast Railways, The Jacobite, which runs sightseeing trips from Fort William to Mallaig from May to October. The service runs twice daily, Monday to Friday with additional weekend services during the summer months. The Jacobite steam train is known for its association with the Harry Potter film series, particularly due to its route along the Glenfinnan Viaduct, which featured in the Harry Potter films.  Ferry services  Mallaig ferry port is located in front of the railway station, approximately away. Caledonian MacBrayne operate ferry services from Mallaig to Armadale on the Isle of Skye, a thirty-minute sailing, as well as daily services to the Small Isles of Canna, R√πm, Eigg and Muck, although the timetable, itinerary and calling points differ from day to day. A small, independent ferry service run by former lifeboatman Bruce Watt sails up Loch Nevis to the remote village of Inverie in Knoydart, and also calls by prior arrangement at Tarbet in Morar, locations that are only accessible by sea. Both Cal Mac and Bruce Watt also offer non-landing sightseeing tickets.  Signalling  One of the semaphore signals removed in 1982 From the time of its opening in 1901, the Mallaig Line was worked throughout by the electric token system. Mallaig signal box was situated south of the station, on the east side of the line. On 14 March 1982, the method of working on the section between and Mallaig was changed to One Train Working (with train staff). Mallaig signal box was closed as a token station, but retained as a ground frame with four levers. All the semaphore signals were removed. On 6 December 1987 the Radio Electronic Token Block (RETB) system was commissioned between Mallaig Junction (now called 'Fort William Junction') and Mallaig. The RETB is controlled from a Signalling Centre at Banavie railway station. In November 1992, the former signal box was demolished and replaced by an ordinary ground frame. The Train Protection & Warning System was installed in 2003.

Allen McClelland and the HO scale model railroad he built featuring this railroad. The V&O; is famous in the model railroading world for setting a new standard for freelanced (fictional) model railroads designed to operate in a prototypical manner and was a major influence upon many model railroaders of the time. In 1984, Mr. McClelland wrote a detailed guide to the construction and operation of the railroad. Model railroad The original V&O; was built in 1962 and set in 1957, operating from Afton, VA to a concealed staging loop at Elm Grove, VA. In the mid 1970s, Allen McClelland began a second phase of construction that expanded the railroad from Elm Grove to Kingswood Junction, VA. Given Allen McClelland's interest in prototypical model railroad operations, along with the changes in prototype railroads during this time, the V&O; ended up moving forward in time a couple of times. A minimal example of this principle was moving the railroad forward one year from 1957 to 1958 so that V&O; SD-24s could be modeled using the latest release from Atlas during the mid-70s. A more drastic example was in 1980 (railroad date August 26th, 1958) when the V&O; ran its last regular revenue steam service and was completely dieselized.McClelland, The V&O; Story, supra, at 92. During this time, Allen McClleland moved the era up a decade from 1958 to 1968, resulting in the loss of some older and minority builder V&O; 1st- Generation diesels. However, the era shift also saw the introduction of many newer 2nd-Generation diesels alongside newer and larger freight cars, just like the prototype. In the mid-late 1990s, the railroad was expanded between Fullerton, VA and Indian Hill Junction, VA as part of a coinciding home expansion. This expansion saw the removal of existing scenes at Gauge Pass, VA and Highland Wye, VA along with the relocation of Durham Sub and Smith Sub staging tracks. This time period also saw the railroad shift from 1968 to its final era of 1975, resulting in the loss of even more 1st-Generation diesels like F-7As and FAs. Independent passenger service was ended in April, 1971 with the creation of Amtrak with the Ridge Runner being the only passenger service left on the Afton Division. In 2001, a move into a new home unfortunately forced Allen McClelland to dismantle the original V&O; Afton Division. The Clintwood section of this layout is currently stored at the National Model Railroad Association's headquarters building in Soddy-Daisy, TN, pending public display in the Scale Model Railroading exhibit at the California State Railroad Museum in Sacramento. At this time, Allen McClelland also began construction on his V&O; Gauley Division layout, picking up from the western end of the Afton Division and carrying on from there. However, construction of this new V&O; was cut short in 2008 by yet another move, but this time to a retirement home without space for a layout as detailed in the October 2008 issue of Scale Rails (the official publication of the National Model Railroad Association), and the January 2009 issue of Model Railroader. Appalachian Lines Several factors came into play in the formation of the Appalachian Lines. Model railroaders Tony Koester and Steve King had quickly become friends as they developed their interest in proto-freelancing (developing a freelanced railroad based on prototype railroads and practices ) and railroad operations. The V&O; was greatly influenced by prototype railroads even as they continued to move forward while the V&O; remained in 1958. This desire to stay up-to-date with real railroading was reflect in Allen McClelland's interest in prototype modeling. Heavily influenced by repeat visits to Appalachian coal country, and the realization that their three small regional railroads would face challenges surviving the real world economy of the 1970s, Tony Koester suggested that Allen's V&O;, his Allegheny Midland and King's Virginia Midland form the Appalachian Lines. Modeled after the Chessie System and the SCL/L&N; Family Lines, each railroad would retain its own corporate identity and color scheme, but would follow a standardized layout for paint schemes. The V&O; would keep its deep blue and white, the AM would adopt a bright red and yellow, and the VM would go with yellow and deep green. Although the Appalachian Lines was initially stated to be formed in 1976, the actual amalgamation took place almost a decade earlier in 1968. Like Chessie System and Family Lines, the Appalachian Lines name would be used in marketing and advertising, allowing the three railroads to pool their resources to remain competitive. Not only was this a great excuse to use \\"run- through\\" power from connecting AM and VM roads, but it also helped strengthen the idea that all three railroads were part of a larger system, and in fact connected to the national railroad network. Thanks to regular coverage in both Railroad Model Craftsman (of which Koester was editor at the time) and Model Railroader magazines, this is probably the most well-known period of the V&O;'s operations.

He is voiced by Phil Cornwell and was created by Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett. In the Gorillaz universe, Murdoc was responsible for most of the conception and formation of the band, and he is angry that 2-D, the fictional vocalist and pianist for the band, is the frontman. He was based on The Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards. As a Satanist, Murdoc's fictional biography is filled with references to Satanism, such as his birthday being on 6/6/66, and indicates that to become a famous musician Murdoc did a deal with the Devil‚Äîleading him to change his middle name to Faust‚Äîwho provided Murdoc with his own bass guitar, El Diablo.Cass Browne & Jamie Hewlett. Rise of the Ogre (2006). In 2018, it was revealed that Murdoc was incarcerated and did not contribute to the band's sixth album The Now Now, instead, being replaced by the character Ace, the leader of The Gang Green Gang from Cartoon Network's 1998 animated series The Powerpuff Girls. He has since returned to the band as an active member and is the bass player in the band's latest project, Song Machine. Development Murdoc is based on The Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards, Frankenstein, and Creeper from Scooby-Doo.Charts of Darkness. Dazed Film & TV (2001) In particular, he was inspired by a photograph of The Rolling Stones taken in 1968 by photographer David Bailey. His wardrobe and fashion is inspired by that of Black Sabbath's Ozzy Osbourne. Once described by creator Jamie Hewlett as being the \\"unpleasant villain of the band\\", Murdoc is a Satanist, and is often depicted wearing an inverted cross necklace, with \\"Hail Satan\\" being a common catchphrase of his. He was created by Hewlett and Albarn in 1998. Fictional history Murdoc was born on June 6th 1966 in Stoke-on-Trent, England to an unknown mother and Sebastian Niccals. In the Gorillaz backstory, Murdoc's family, his father Sebastian especially, were frequently abusive towards Murdoc, and his father often exploited him by forcing him to perform at local pub talent shows against his will for money. His distinct nose shape is said to be the result of the frequent physical abuse from family and peers that he was the victim of since his childhood. Murdoc's experiences of abuse as a child have had a significant impact on his psychological state as an adult. As a teenager, Murdoc became interested in Satanism, eventually making a deal with the devil and selling his soul to become a rock star. From this point on, Murdoc's middle name changed from Alphonce to Faust, and Satan gave him his bass guitar in finalization of the deal. Murdoc is said to have went on a crime spree with a gang of criminals in a stolen car on 15 August 1997, and crashed said car through the window of the keyboard shop that a then 19-year-old Stuart Pot was working at, landing on his face directly and putting him in a coma, which gave him hyphema in one eye, leading Murdoc to be sentenced to extensive community service and mandatory caretaking of Stuart. Afterwards, while in the car with a comatose Stuart, he caused another car accident, with this one causing Stuart to fly through the windshield and onto the curb, giving him hyphema in the other eye. He was then given the nickname 2-D by Murdoc and he immediately chose him to be the frontman of a new band he was forming. Soon after, Murdoc would then buy a studio after discovering it on the internet and move into it with 2-D, giving it the name Kong Studios. Murdoc would then go on to kidnap drummer Russel Hobbs while he was working at a record store called Big Rick Black's Record Shack in SoHo. Their then guitarist Paula Cracker, who was dating 2-D at the time, had an affair with Murdoc in the bathroom of their studio. She was then kicked out of the band after Russel punched Murdoc in the nose and gave it another disfigurement after catching the affair in action. She was later replaced by a Japanese guitar prodigy named Noodle after she shipped herself to Kong Studios in a FedEx crate in 1998. At this point, Gorillaz was officially formed and ready to launch. After the success of the band‚Äôs debut album and its tour, Gorillaz were approached by a movie director who expressed an interest in the production of a potential Gorillaz movie and the band briefly moved to California. Following this, Gorillaz had a meeting in which they all discussed potential concepts for a Gorillaz film. In the middle of the meeting, 2-D and Murdoc had an argument that ended with Murdoc strangling 2-D and Russel punching Murdoc in 2-D‚Äôs defense. After this event, the band went their separate ways. Murdoc relocated to a brothel in Tijuana, Mexico and was arrested for counterfeit checks, later discovering after escaping and returning to Kong that bandmate Noodle had rough demos for a second Gorillaz album already written, with Murdoc then contributing his basslines to the album. After Demon Days success further escalated Gorillaz‚Äô status as virtual pop stars, Noodle was presumed dead after the music video for El Ma√±ana appeared to show the flying windmill island she was on in the Feel Good Inc music video being gunned down by attack helicopters. Soon thereafter, a panicked 2-D and Russel departed from Kong upon discovering this information. After going various places across the world, Murdoc became an arms broker for a group of mercenaries named the Black Clouds to raise money quickly after growing short on income, subsequently burning down Kong Studios, committing insurance fraud to save money and fleeing from the UK on a boat to an island of floating landfill in Point Nemo that he would later convert into his home. Taking inspiration from Thunderbirds' Tracy Island, Murdoc dubbed this island \\"Plastic Beach\\", creating a cyborg replica of guitarist Noodle and kidnapping frontman 2-D to begin work on Gorillaz third album, Plastic Beach without contributions from Noodle or Russel. After Noodle and Russel eventually arrived on Plastic Beach, the island was later shot down by a group of pirates and the band then parted ways once again. In the aftermath of Plastic Beach, Gorillaz‚Äô 2016 interactive short story The Book of Murdoc reveals that Murdoc and Cyborg Noodle were arrested for breach of contract by EMI and then released under the condition that he record a new Gorillaz album, to which he agreed and was reunited with his former bandmates to record Humanz, the band's first album in seven years. At the 2018 Brit Awards, it was revealed that Murdoc was incarcerated at Wormwood Scrubs, being absent for the making of Gorillaz' sixth album, The Now Now and temporarily replaced by Ace from The Powerpuff Girls at the time, starting an extensive campaign to have himself freed from prison called ‚Äò‚ÄôFree Murdoc‚Äô‚Äô. He has since been released from prison and returned to the band on 20 September 2018, starring with the rest of Gorillaz in an advertisement campaign promoting their line of G-Shock watches called Mission M101 and joining them for the final leg of The Now Now Tour. He has since become the bassist for the band's latest project Song Machine. Physical appearance Murdoc is based on Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones. As such, he has a similar moptop and facial features. Murdoc is designed as having distinct sickly green colored skin, and is often illustrated with yellow colored eyes, sometimes being depicted with a red pupil in his right eye. He also has a misshapen nose and sharp, sometimes yellow teeth and a large grin. His hairstyle is a black moptop that covers a portion of his face and hides his eyebrows. His eyebrows have sometimes been visible in artwork since Humanz in 2017. As with the rest of the Gorillaz members, Murdoc is regularly depicted in different wardrobe and his clothing changes often, in contrast to most other cartoon characters.Although Murdoc often is frequently designed in different clothing the other Gorillaz characters are, his wardrobe is generally less varied that the others. He typically tends to stick to wearing a grey or black long-sleeved shirt, grey or blue jeans, and cuban heel boots with his inverted cross necklace. He sometimes wears a purple and red cape, especially during the Demon Days era, although the cape has returned in Song Machine. He has an overbite when his mouth is closed and he has a bright red fingernail on one of his pinky fingers. He and all of Gorillaz' other virtual band members have also gotten older with each Gorillaz release. Originally in his mid-30s when Gorillaz was released in 2001, he is now a middle aged man who is entering his mid-50s. He is often depicted as shirtless and sometimes even completely naked, and has had several different tattoos displayed on his body throughout the years. Personality Murdoc has been frequently depicted as the perpetuator of constant physical and psychological abuse towards Gorillaz bandmate 2-D, although this abuse appears to have stopped in recent years. Murdoc's personality is defined by pride, cynicism, sadism and misanthropy, and he's been shown to be consistently rude and sarcastic towards the people around him. He is perpetually angry and bitter and often takes it out on his peers. Murdoc has a dark and off-color sense of humor, regularly displaying a tendency towards controversial behavior. In the G-Bite Fancy Dress, he is shown wearing a nazi uniform for a photoshoot, and in some old Gorillaz images, his winnebago has been shown displaying a confederate flag. He can be very talkative in interviews, and has a habit of going on long tangents and rants. He has a history of being a womanizer, described as being \\"a rent-a- quote misogynist who speaks without a taste filter\\", but he has since developed into a self-described feminist. Murdoc has been shown to have an abundance of self-confidence and pride, to the point of appearing to be arrogant and narcissistic, frequently speaking highly of himself and boasting of his accomplishments. He is very self-centered and egotistical, believing that the world exists for his own pleasure. Murdoc is also known for telling lies and giving inaccurate accounts of various kinds about himself and the band. He is resentful and jealous, often finding himself in competition with others. Murdoc enjoys being the center of attention and most of his outlandish behavior is due to this. He is a hedonistic thrill seeker with a history of taking dangerous risks for the sake of adrenaline, often putting his own life and his bandmates' lives in danger as a result. He has been described by creator Jamie Hewlett as the band's villain, which places him in the villain protagonist category of characters. Murdoc is a habitual offender criminal and convicted felon who has regularly partaken in various criminal activity since his childhood. In his youth, Murdoc is said to have been a troublemaker and a delinquent, pulling many pranks and exhibiting generally disorderly conduct as a school student, resulting in his expulsion from school at 16. Murdoc first met Gorillaz frontman 2-D in 1997 while partaking in a crime spree with a gang of criminals. In 2003, Murdoc was sentenced to 30-years of imprisonment in Tijuana, Mexico for giving counterfeit checks to prostitutes, but escaped with the help of two fellow inmates. In Gorillaz‚Äô 2016 interactive short story The Book of Murdoc, it was revealed that Murdoc and Cyborg Noodle had been imprisoned for breach of contract following the events of Plastic Beach before being released only under the condition that a new Gorillaz album be recorded. In 2018, he was allegedly incarcerated for what he claims was a false drug smuggling accusation (but ended up being for unpaid parking tickets) and organized a campaign with the goal of setting him free from prison called Free Murdoc. Murdoc has been hinted at as being bisexual since 2004, with Noodle saying in a Q&A; session, ‚ÄúMurdoc says that he can pick up boys with chopsticks but he has used his dictaphone. I do not understand this.‚Äù The music video for Dare ends with Murdoc sleeping in the same bed as the song's guest artist Shaun Ryder. In the first of Murdoc's Pirate Radio broadcasts from 2010, he mentions having sexual desires for comedian Ronnie Corbett. In Gorillaz‚Äô 2018 Free Murdoc ARG, Murdoc responds with ‚Äúmy sexual preferences are more complex and terrifying than you can ever imagine‚Äù when questioned about his sexuality. Murdoc once owned a pet raven named Cortez, who has since died due to being accidentally microwaved by Murdoc. Cortez can be seen in various Gorillaz images from the Demon Days era of the band, including the cover of Gorillaz' 2006 autobiography Rise of the Ogre, which is a flipped image of Cortez. Murdoc is also an inventor, building a few different contraptions over the years. For Plastic Beach, Murdoc built Cyborg Noodle, an android replica of the Gorillaz guitarist with all of her skills, memories, and personality traits, using a strand of Noodle‚Äôs hair as a DNA sample to start the process. In the Song Machine episode Pac-Man, Murdoc builds an Orgone accumulator to use as a portal of his own, and built a modified Pac-Man arcade machine for 2-D to play.\\"GORILLAZ: SONG MACHINE SEASON 1 EPISODE 5 ‚ÄòPAC-MAN‚Äô FT SCHOOLBOY Q\\". Nasty Little Man. Retrieved 6 October 2020. Murdoc's speaking voice, provided by famous British comedian and actor Phil Cornwell, is low, rough, and raspy. Despite being from Stoke-on-Trent, Murdoc speaks in a cockney accent rather than the Potteries dialect commonly associated with the region. Role in Gorillaz Murdoc was designed as the bassist and leader of Gorillaz, and is usually portrayed as the main director of the band for most of their albums. There have been exceptions to this, such as 2010's The Fall and 2018's The Now Now, both of which were shown to be completely lead by 2-D, with Murdoc being replaced by Ace from the Cartoon Network animated series The Powerpuff Girls while incarcerated during the making of The Now Now. Demon Days was mostly written by Noodle, although Murdoc would often try to take all of the credit for it. Murdoc can play other instruments (as can the rest of the characters), but generally leaves them to the other members and sticks to playing bass. One such example of an exception to this is in Plastic Beach, where Murdoc claims to have mainly programmed the drums himself using Gorillaz drummer Russel Hobb's Hip-hop Machine, as Russel was absent for the recording of Plastic Beach. Murdoc has occasionally contributed vocals to Gorillaz songs. He claims in the Gorillaz press interview CD We Are The Dury that he is the vocalist on the Demon Days track White Light, and has been portrayed in the fifth installment of his radio show Pirate Radio as the robotic voice on the track Phoner to Arizona from The Fall. His pet raven Cortez is attributed to the wailing guitar on the Demon Days track O Green World. Other appearances In 2006, Murdoc made an appearance in an advertisement for telecommunications company Motorola. In the commercial, Murdoc plays a piano naked in the middle of a field of sheep. On 30 July 2006, Murdoc hosted an animated Gorillaz segment in the Season 13 premiere of MTV Cribs, giving a tour of Gorillaz' fictional headquarters at Kong Studios.On 15 November 2010, Murdoc was the host of a tour of Internet Explorer 9 in a seven minute animated short made for the launch of the software. Murdoc and the rest of Gorillaz appear on the back cover of creator Jamie Hewlett's 2017 art book, featured alongside characters from all of Hewlett's projects.

Its first official analog controller was the PlayStation Analog Joystick (SCPH-1110). History The Dual Analog Controller was first displayed under glass at the PlayStation Expo 96‚Äì97, which was held from November 1 to November 4, 1996. It was released in Japan in April 1997, coincident with the Japanese releases of analog-capable titles Tobal 2 and Bushido Blade. It was advertised as allowing for more precise and fluid control of the games' fighters, with the rumble feature contributing to a more realistic experience. Before its release in the United States, Sony decided that vibration feedback would be removed from the European and American versions of the controller. According to a Sony spokesperson, \\"We evaluated all the features and decided, for manufacturing reasons, that what was most important to gamers was the analog feature.\\" Reasons for dropping the vibration feedback reportedly included its being linked to premature malfunction of the controllers. There were rumors that Nintendo had attempted to legally block the release of the controller in North America due to the vibration feature's similarity to Nintendo's Rumble Pak, but Nintendo firmly denied that it had taken any form of legal action over Sony's controllers. Moreover, according to the United States Patent Office, two employees of Atari Games have held a patent on vibrating game controller technology since March of 1991. Another theory for the vibration feedback being dropped was that Sony simply wanted to keep the price of the controller down so as to maximize user adoption. It was released in the United States on August 27, 1997, and in Europe in September 1997 with little promotion. A few months later, the first DualShock controller was released in Japan on November 20, 1997. Namco had already released an analog controller for PlayStation called NeGcon. Sony's Dual Analog Controller's analog mode was not compatible with the NeGcon-compatible games such as Wipeout and Ridge Racer. However, Need for Speed II, Gran Turismo, and Gran Turismo 2 feature compatibility with both NeGcon and Dual Analog control schemes. Fans of a smaller form factor, Japanese players complained that the very long hand grips made the controller too large to be held properly and the lack of a rumble feature in the U.S. and European models are the most commonly cited reasons that Sony decided to end production of this controller and redesign it. This redesign eventually became the DualShock. The Dual Analog controller was discontinued in all three markets in 1998, to be replaced by the DualShock. Features The Dual Analog controller has three modes of operation: Digital, which disables the Analog sticks, Analog (as also found on DualShock/DualShock 2 controllers) and an Analog Flightstick mode emulating the PlayStation Analog Joystick that is not available on the DualShock or DualShock 2. If a PlayStation game is DualShock or Dual Analog compatible, the player may press the Analog button located between the two analog sticks to activate the analog mode. This is indicated by a red LED. If the Dual Analog controller is switched to analog mode while using a game which is not analog-compatible, the game will not register any button presses or, in some cases, the PlayStation will consider the controller to be detached. The ability to emulate Sony's own PlayStation Analog Joystick by pressing the \\"Analog\\" button a second time to reveal a green LED (this was commonly referred to as \\"Flightstick Mode\\") provided a less expensive alternative to the FlightStick Analog Joystick and retailed for an average of US$35 compared to the Flightstick's retail price of US$70. Similarly to the Nintendo 64 controller, the Dual Analog Controller was designed to be held in four different ways: standard control, in which the left thumb uses the directional buttons and the right thumb uses the action buttons; analog control, in which the left thumb uses the left analog stick and the right thumb uses the action buttons; dual analog control, which imitates the Dual Analog Joystick, with both thumbs positioned over the analog sticks, and the shoulder buttons used instead of the action buttons; and analog-digital control, in which the left thumb uses the directional buttons, the right thumb uses the right analog stick, and the shoulder buttons are again used for actions. MechWarrior 2, Ace Combat 2, Descent Maximum, and Colony Wars were among the shortlist of twenty-seven PlayStation Flightstick compatible games. Differences from DualShock Clockwise from top left, DualShock, Dual Analog Controller and original PlayStation Controller. The Dual Analog controller features several aspects that remain exclusive to it, and were scrapped or redesigned for the release of the DualShock controller. * Only the Japanese version features a vibration feedback function. The European and American versions of the controller do however include circuitry and mounts for a rumble motor, a possible leftover from the Japanese version of the controller, and therefore installing the motor is a simple process. Due to a lack of vibration-compatible games at the time, the European and American versions were not shipped with rumble feedback and, as a result, weigh significantly less than their overseas counterpart, and fall somewhere between the weights of the standard controller and the DualShock. * The hand grips are longer than the original controller and the later DualShock controller. The body of the controller is also wider, spacing the pads slightly farther apart. This wider controller body has been retained on the DualShock and all later PlayStation controllers. From the top: the original PlayStation Controller, Dual Analog Controller and DualShock. Note the ridges on the Dual Analog L2 and R2 buttons. * The L2 and R2 buttons have ridges at the top edge to easily distinguish them from the L1 and R1 buttons and are spaced farther apart than the original controller or DualShock. * The L2 and R2 buttons are also wider than the standard controller but shorter than the DualShock. * The analog sticks are concave and lack the rubberised coating that has been used on the DualShock and later controllers. * In addition to the standard digital mode and the regular \\"red LED\\" Analog mode, there is a third mode that emulates the layout of Sony's own PlayStation Analog Joystick, and is indicated by a green LED. This feature is missing on the DualShock. * The \\"Analog\\" button, used for switching modes, is raised instead of recessed like the DualShock's button and can be more easily hit accidentally. * The Analog mode cannot be changed or locked by software as it can with the DualShock controller and later. * The Dual Analog's rumble circuit will not respond to PlayStation 2 software even if a rumble motor is installed.

Tucker, we learn, was born in a box of Kleenexes and other odds and ends on Tenth Avenue, and fled his nest at a young age to avoid sanitation workers. He takes his name from \\"Merry Tucker's Home-Baked Goods\\", a bakery on Tenth Avenue. He meets Harry Kitten, who took his name from two children he heard talking. One said \\"Harry-you're a character!\\" and the kitten decided he too wanted to be a character. The two become friends and search New York City for a home of their own. Their wanderings take them to the basement of the Empire State Building and to Gramercy Park, among other places.

Yucaipa.org It is located near the city of Yucaipa, in the Inland Empire region. It is surrounded by the San Bernardino National Forest on the eastern and northern sides. History The indigenous Cahuilla were traditionally active in the area of Wildwood Canyon, as were the Serrano and Tongva. The area near Yucaipa was known as a crossroads for traveling indigenous people. Historic buildings remain in the park from the 1930s Hi Up House ranch and 1940s Hunt Ranch eras. After a flood threatened developers' housing subdivision plans, the California Department of Parks and Recreation acquired in the canyon. In May 2003 a park dedication ceremony was held at Wildwood Canyon. Wildwood Canyon State Park Wildwood Canyon State Park is currently open only for day use, from sunrise to sunset. The primary activities are horseback riding, hiking, and mountain biking. The canyon lies between the San Andreas Fault on the north and the San Jacinto Fault to the south. Wildwood Canyon hosts diverse wildlife. Birds commonly seen include the California quail, western meadowlark, towhee, phainopepla, red-tailed hawk, Bewicks wren, Bullocks oriole, and white-tailed kite. Bobcats, black bears, gray foxes can be found in the park. Mountain lions use the canyon as a wildlife corridor. The San Diego pocket mouse, a threatened species due to declining to habitat loss, is found in the canyon. The dominant plant communities are grasslands in most open areas, and chaparral sage scrub on the slopes. Dominant chaparral plants include chamise (Adenostoma fasciculatum), scrub oak (Quercus berberidifolia), California lilacs (Ceanothus), and black sage (Salvia mellifera). buckwheat, monkey flower, Lord's candle and silk tassel bush.

Bradley is a climatologist and University Distinguished Professor in the Department of Geosciences at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where he is also research director of the Climate System Research Center. Bradley's work indicates that the warming of Earth's climate system in the twentieth century is inexplicable via natural mechanisms. Biography Ray Bradley is a Distinguished Professor in the Department of Geosciences and Director of the Climate System Research Center at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. He did his undergraduate work at Southampton University (U.K.) and his post-graduate studies (M.S., Ph.D.) at the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research, University of Colorado, Boulder. He also earned a D.Sc. from Southampton University, for his contributions in paleoclimatology. In 2015, he received the Zuckerberg Leadership Chair from the University of Massachusetts Foundation, and he was a Visiting Professor at the University of Bergen, Norway. Bradley received the Oeschger Medal of the European Geosciences Union and honorary degrees (D.Sc honoris causa) from Lancaster University (U.K.), Queen's University (Canada) and the University of Bern (Switzerland). He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, the American Geophysical Union, the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the Arctic Institute of North America. He was also elected as a Foreign Member of the Finnish Academy of Science and Letters, and Academia Europaea, the European Academy of Science. Bradley's research focuses on climate variability over recent centuries and millennia, using instrumental and proxy records of past climate, making major contributions to our understanding of climate change over the last century. He has made it clear that these changes are well outside the envelope of natural variability that the earth has experienced over recent millennia. His research on natural forcing factors has helped to clarify the factors that caused climates to vary in the past. He has shown the critical importance of well-calibrated paleoclimate proxies for placing recent changes in a long-term context, thereby clarifying the important effects that humans have had on climate in recent decades. This led to him becoming the target of political attacks by global warming deniers, to which he has responded, in terms that provide a clear explanation of the issues involved for the public at large, in \\"Global Warming and Political Intimidation\\", 2011, University of Massachusetts Press, Amherst, also available in a Japanese translation [2012] by Kagaku Dojin, Tokyo. Bradley has written or edited thirteen books on climatic change including \\"Paleoclimatology: Reconstructing Climates of the Quaternary\\" (3rd edition, 2014) [Elsevier/Academic Press, San Diego; , which won a 2015 Award from the Text and Academic Authors Association. Other books include, \\"The Hadley Circulation, Present, Past and Future\\" (eds. H.F. Diaz, and R.S. Bradley, 2004. Kluwer Academic, Dordrecht); \\"Paleoclimate, Global Change and the Future\\" (eds. K. Alverson, R.S. Bradley and T.F. Pedersen, 2003; Springer, Berlin); \\"Climate Change and Society\\" (R.S. Bradley and N.E. Law, 2001, Stanley Thornes, Cheltenham, U.K.); \\"Climate Variations and Forcing Mechanisms of the Last 2000 years\\" (eds. P.D. Jones, R.S. Bradley and J. Jouzel, 1996. Springer, Berlin), and \\"Climate Since A.D. 1500\\" (eds. R.S. Bradley and P.D. Jones, 1995. Routledge, London). In addition, Bradley has authored/co-authored more than 200 peer-reviewed articles on climate change, covering a wide range of topics. He has a particular focus on the climate of the Arctic, and of mountainous areas, reflecting his long-standing interests in those regions. He has carried out extensive fieldwork in the Arctic and North Atlantic region (Canadian High Arctic, Greenland, Svalbard, the Faroe Islands and northern Norway). Bradley's research has been supported primarily by the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy, NOAA and the National Geographic Society. Bradley was a contributing author to the IPCC TAR , and worked on reconstructing the temperature record of the past 1000 years with Michael E. Mann and Malcolm K. Hughes, a dendroclimatologist. This work received a disproportionate amount of attention after figuring prominently in the IPCC TAR SPM. In 2005, the Chair of the US House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce, Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas) demanded that Bradley provide a detailed accounting of the data and funding of his research on climate change. Bradley recommends a commentary by Gavin Schmidt on the RealClimate website () as providing a very good guide to the issues. Ray Bradley has been an advisor to various government and international agencies, including the U.S., Swiss, Swedish, Finnish, German and U.K. National Science Foundations, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the National Research Council, the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the US-Russia Working Group on Environmental Protection, and the International Geosphere- Biosphere Program (IGBP). He has given many TV and radio interviews, and is a speaker on climate change and global warming, and global environmental changes. He has given talks at venues in China, Japan, Dubai, England, Switzerland, France, Germany, Spain, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Canada, Chile, Argentina and the United States. Interests and activities Bradley's research interests are in climatology and paleoclimatology, with a particular focus on how climate has changed since the last ice age. He has worked in the Arctic‚ÄîEllesmere and Cornwallis Island in the Canadian High Arctic, southern and southeastern Greenland, the Faroe Islands, northwestern Norway and Svalbard.

It is on the Sturt Highway A20, 220 kilometres north-east of Adelaide, the capital of the state of South Australia. It is primarily an agricultural and viticultural town and is located on Lake Bonney Riverland, a freshwater lake. The population was 1,914 in 2011. History The original inhabitants were the Barmerara Meru clan of the Ngawadj people. It is not known where the name \\"Barmera\\" comes from but it is suspected that it means \\"water place\\" or \\"land dwellers\\", being a word from the local Aboriginal group. Others postulate it comes from Barmeedjie, the name of the tribe that lived to the north of the Murray River prior to European settlement. Lake Bonney was first seen by Charles Bonney and Joseph Hawdon in 1838 drove cattle along the Murray River. The land however, was settled in 1859 with the establishment of Overland Corner Hotel. It was a popular area with drovers that drove sheep from New South Wales into South Australia. A police station was also built to prevent and stop arguments between the aboriginal people and settlers. An irrigation system was established in the town in 1921. The town became gazetted. An influx of World War I veterans settled with promises of irrigated land from the government. A railway station was opened in 1928 and the town was proclaimed in the same year. In World War II an internment camp was established south of Barmera in Loveday and was one of the largest World War II camps in Australia. Heritage listings Barmera has a number of heritage- listed sites, including: * 2-4 Barwell Avenue: Bonney Theatre * 2 Fowles Street: Barmera Irrigation Office * North Lake Road: Napper's Accommodation House Ruins Climate and geography Barmera exists in a semi-arid location, north of Goyder's Line. Barmera is surrounded by mallee scrub. It is 29 metres above sea level. Barmera has a dry climate with hot summers and warm days and cold frosty nights in winter with seasonal temperatures a few degrees above Adelaide's temperatures and similar to those of Berri. The weather patterns are similar to those of Berri. It receives less than 250 mm of rain per annum. Rain patterns shift from year to year over a nineteen-year cycle. Present day Lake Bonney has sandy beaches, a jetty, fishing and sailing. Every Easter, a sailing regatta is held on Lake Bonney and a country music festival is held every June. Riverland Field Days are held in September a Show is held in March. The town is home to the sporting teams Barmera/Monash Roos Football Club and the Barmera United Soccer Club.

The show is hosted by Raffy Tulfo and Sharee Roman. Format Raffy Tulfo hosts the program. The show investigates and exposes cases of abuse, dishonesty, exploitation, and family disputes (Sumbong at Aksyon), as well as recognizes ordinary people who return items of value that they find in their course of work (Solian ng Bayan). The show regularly emphasizes Tulfo's no-nonsense approach and interrogation, sometimes laced with profanity. The most common feature of the show is Sumbong at Aksyon, where complainants tell Tulfo about their situation and seek assistance to resolve it. Tulfo puts the other party on the air to get their side of the story and encourages both parties to talk to each other on the air. Tulfo may occasionally conclude that the complainant is the one who committed something wrong and, as such, may refuse further assistance; in rare cases, Tulfo himself may even take action against the complainant (e.g. refer him/her to the police and file charges) if warranted. After hearing both sides of the story, Tulfo may contact someone in a position (e.g. high-ranking police officials, social workers) to further assist the aggrieved party. An average of four sets of complainants are featured during the show. If a complainant's conversation with the other party is quite lengthy and time is about to run out, they may be asked to continue it off-air. The final show of each month begins with an awarding ceremony featuring people who returned items to their owners in the Solian ng Bayan segments aired throughout the month. The awardees receive a medal, plaque, cash reward, and items from the sponsors; these are in addition to the cash reward and items received during the Solian ng Bayan segment in which they appeared. Wanted sa Radyo Segments *Accomplishment Report - About Wanted's cases that went through successfully. *Aksyon sa Text - Complaints and actions that came from texters/callers. *Huwarang Pulis - A monthly segment honoring honest policemen. *Sumbong at Aksyon - A segment featuring walk-in complaints and on- the-spot solutions. *Solian ng Bayan - A segment where lost items are returned by finders. The rule is if the lost items remain unclaimed by the end of 1 month, then it can be kept by finders. And every month, they honor chosen honest finders, giving them plaques and additional rewards. *Wanted Update - Wanted's cases that are still ongoing. *Wanted Netizens - Posts by netizens who reacted accordingly. Wanted Reporters Current * Carol Domingo * Odette Molina * Maureen Peralta * Jam Cordero Former * Jana Abrigo * Benjamin Dela Cruz * Alyssa Dosal * Jill Nebrida Internet and Social Media In July 2016, Wanted sa Radyo launched a website entitled \\"Raffy Tulfo In Action\\", which features the cases featured in WSR and also cases in the spin- off segment Itimbre Mo kay Tulfo on Aksyon sa Tanghali. The show's video feed is simulcast over Radyo5's Facebook page and a copy of the day's show is also posted on the Raffy Tulfo In Action YouTube channel. The social media accounts contain video clips that feature how some of the cases were resolved as well as how the off-air conversations between the parties have gone. Spin-off Television Series From January 28, 2011 to July 30, 2012, Wanted, acting as an extension and TV version of Wanted sa Radyo, was aired every Monday at 11:30pm‚Äì12:00am on TV5. AksyonTV aired its producer's cut from February 21, 2011 to January 11, 2019. The set was different, with the host sitting comfortably in a radio booth setting. Respondents and interviewees are videotaped while they are on the phone with him. Controversies Jee Ick- Joo's abduction and killing On October 21, 2016, a complainant named alias \\"Joy\\" was exulted to WSR that her employee South Korean businessman named Jee Ick-Joo was kidnapped by a policeman identified as SPO3 Richard \\"Ricky\\" Sta. Isabel, due to alleged involvement of illegal drugs on 18 October in Angeles, Pampanga, the maid ang Jee was sent to Quezon City and eventually separated at Camp Crame, and that night when they separated Jee was killed in nearby White House, the residence of the Philippine National Police Chief, incidentally Gen. Ronald dela Rosa was in Beijing accompanied by President Rodrigo Duterte on his State Visit. Political Involvement Raffy Tulfo and his siblings are staunch supporters of President Rodrigo Duterte's policies. During the 2019 elections, he and Erwin acquired ACT-CIS Partylist from former Representative Samuel Pagdilao, Jr. and nominated Erwin's Chief of Staff Eric Go Yap, Raffy's wife Jocelyn Tulfo, and co-host Ni√±a Taduran, while Ramon, Wanda, and Ben declined to participate. ACT-CIS took the top position with 2.6 million votes, earning the maximum of three seats at the 18th Congress. One of the campaign strategy is inserting ACT-CIS logo to the Raffy Tulfo in Action social media pages, as RTIA is only a blocktimer to the 5 Network.

The company was subsequently absorbed by the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway in 1862 and eventually became part of the North British Railway three years later. However, in 1891, the North British was forced to come to an agreement with the rival Caledonian Railway to give the latter access to Balloch (and the Loch Lomond steamships) over C&DJR; metals in order to prevent the building of a competing route by the Caledonian company - this resulted in the Lanarkshire and Dumbartonshire Railway arriving from via in 1896.Railscot - Lanarkshire and Dunbartonshire Junction Railway www.railbrit.co.uk; Retrieved 2013-10-10 Trains on the West Highland Railway also began serving the station following its completion on 1 August 1894 and these continue to call here to this day.

Early life Kibi no Makibi was born in Shimotsumichi County, Bitchu Province (present-day Kurashiki, Okayama Prefecture) as Shimotsumichi-no Asomi Makibi, as a son of Shimotsumichi-no Asomi Kunikatsu. Shimotsumichi clan was a line of local elites and came from the greater Kibi clan. Kibi was also the ancient name of area he came from (Kibi Province), which encompassed Bitchu, Bizen, Bingo and Mimasaka Provinces. Career In 717-718, Kibi was part of the Japanese mission to Tang China (Kent≈çshi) with Abe no NakamaroNussbaum, \\"Abe no Nakamaro\\" at p. 3. and Genb≈ç.Nussbaum, \\"Genb≈ç\\" at p. 235. Kibi stayed in China for 17 years before returning to Japan.Fogel, Joshua. (1996). ; excerpt, \\"Like Genb≈ç, Kibi no Makibi remained in China after the embassy ships returned to Japan, returning home himself at the same time as Genb≈ç seventeen years later.\\" He is credited with bringing back a number of things, introducing to Japan the game of go and the art of embroidery. In 737, he received promotion to the junior fifth rank. His influence at court triggered the Fujiwara no Hirotsugu Rebellion of 740. In 751, at the senior fourth rank (upper grade), he received an appointment as vice-ambassador to the T'ang Dynasty and traveled to China the following year, returning to Japan in 753. Kibi spent some years in Ky≈´sh≈´ as the assistant administrator of Dazaifu (the principal governmental post on the island); he returned to Nara. In 764, he was made head of the project to construct T≈çdai-ji. Promotion to the junior third rank followed. He was appointed to head an army to put down the uprising by Fujiwara no Nakamaro. Reaching the second rank in 765, he took the offices of Major Councillor, then Minister of the Right. In 770, he supported a losing candidate for the throne and submitted his resignation from office. The court accepted only his resignation from military office and retained him as Minister of the Right. He finally resigned in 771, devoting himself to the study of Confucian principles and their applications in Japanese administration. Kibi died in 775 at the age of 80. Kibi has sometimes been credited with inventing the katakana phonetic syllabary and writing system. A late 12th century narrative handscroll in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston depicting Kibi's journey to China is one of the earliest of all Japanese narrative pictorial handscrolls (e-maki) known. It is believed to have been commissioned to help support the prestige of a school of divination that claimed connections to Kibi. Its purchase by the museum in 1932 directly led to the strengthening of Japanese laws against the removal of cultural properties of particular importance from the country.Morse, Anne Nishimura et al.

ADSP was adopted as a standards track RFC 5617 in August 2009, but declared \\"Historic\\" in November 2013 after \\"...almost no deployment and use in the 4 years since...\\".  Concepts  Author address The author address is the one specified in the header field defined in RFC 5322. In the unusual cases where more than one address is defined in that field, RFC 5322 provides for a field to be used instead. The domains in 5322-From addresses are not necessarily the same as in the more elaborated Purported Responsible Address covered by Sender ID specified in RFC 4407. The domain in a 5322-From address is also not necessarily the same as in the envelope sender address defined in RFC 5321, also known as SMTP MAIL FROM, envelope-From, 5321-From, or , optionally protected by SPF specified in RFC 7208. Author Domain Signature An Author Domain Signature is a valid DKIM signature in which the domain name of the DKIM signing entity, i.e., the d tag in the DKIM-Signature header field, is the same as the domain name in the author address. This binding recognizes a higher value for author domain signatures than other valid signatures that may happen to be found in a message. In fact, it proves that the entity that controls the DNS zone for the author ‚Äî and hence also the destination of replies to the message's author ‚Äî has relayed the author's message. Most likely, the author has submitted the message through the proper message submission agent. Such message qualification can be verified independently of any published domain signing practice. Author Domain Signing Practices The practices are published in a DNS record by the author domain. For an author address , it may be set as _adsp._domainkey.example.com. in txt \\"dkim=unknown\\" Three possible signing practices are provided for: * unknown, which is the same as not defining any record, says the domain might sign some, most, or all email, * all says all mail from the domain is signed with an Author Domain Signature, * discardable says all mail from the domain is signed with an Author Domain Signature; furthermore, if such signature is missing or invalid, the domain owners want the receiving server to drop the message; that is, silently throw it away. Caveat The ADSP specification explicitly discourages publishing a record different from \\"unknown\\" for domains who have independent users and a usage policy that does not explicitly restrict them to sending mail only from designated mail servers, since mail sent independently of the organization will not be signed.rfc5617#appendix-B.5 However explicitly that caveat is worded, it is not straightforward to understand the purpose and the limitations of ADSP. One of ADSP's authors holds that it is better to publish private lists of discardable domains, maintained by competent people, rather than letting each domain state their policy. Recognizing that the spec has shipped an untested prototype, the author of a popular ADSP implementation has proposed to downgrade ADSP to experimental status. Later on, it was actually downgraded to historical. The consideration that DMARC covers more or less the same use case was influential, but not tied in.  History  For some time ADSP was known as ASP (Author Signing Practices), or the original SSP (Sender Signing Practices), until a protocol naming poll. Domainkeys, DKIM's predecessor, had an Outbound Signing policy consisting of a single character, \\"-\\" if a domain signs all email, and \\"~\\" otherwise.RFC 4870, Section 3.6 Policy Statement of Sending Domain. DKIM intentionally avoided signers' policies considerations, so that DKIM does not validate a message's \\"From\\" field directly, but is a policy-neutral authentication protocol. The association between the signer and the right to use \\"From\\", a field visible to end users, was deferred to a separate specification. Eric Allman, the author of Sendmail, was an editor of the ADSP specification for the IETF DKIM Working Group. The draft ADSP specification started in June 2007 and went through 11 revisions and lengthy discussion before being published as RFC in August 2009 - but was declared \\"Historic\\" four years later in November 2013 after \\"...almost no deployment and use in the 4 years since...\\" See also *DKIM *DMARC *SMTP *Phishing *E-mail authentication References  External links  * DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) Author Domain Signing Practices (ADSP) * IETF DKIM working group (started 2006) * Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM) Category:Email authentication ","title":"Author Domain Signing Practices"},{"id":"4242262","text":"Cris Edward Dishman (born August 13, 1965) is an American football coach and former cornerback who played for the Houston Oilers, the Kansas City Chiefs, the Minnesota Vikings, and the Washington Redskins during his thirteen-year career from 1988 to 2000 in the National Football League. Early career Dishman attended St. Francis DeSales High School where he was two time Kentucky All-State in 1981 and 1982. Dishman played college football at Purdue University, where he was named to the All-Big Ten team in 1987. He also ran track for the Boilermakers, running the 200-meter dash and 400-meter dash. He graduated in 1988 with a degree in criminal justice. Dishman was selected in the 5th round with the 125th pick of the 1988 NFL Draft by the Houston Oilers. In Dishman's first season with the Oilers, he played 15 of the 16 games, and finished the season without an interception. However, Dishman did score a touchdown during a game against the Philadelphia Eagles, when Eugene Seale blocked a punt attempt and Dishman ran it into the end zone. During the 1989 season, he played all 16 games and racked up 4 interceptions. By the end of his first two seasons in the league, he also blocked two punts and a field goal, along with his special teams touchdown. In 1990, with the addition of new head coach Jack Pardee, Dishman was moved to the starting left cornerback position, and finished the season with 4 interceptions. His best season as a pro came during the 1991 NFL season. During this season, Dishman had a seven- game stretch where he forced at least one turnover in each contest. The streak started in week 2 against the Cincinnati Bengals. On the opening drive, Dishman tackled tight end Rodney Hollman at the goal line, forcing a fumble on the Bengals' opening drive. The next time the Oilers faced the Bengals during week nine, Dishman picked off a Boomer Esiason pass to mark the seventh straight game in which he forced a turnover. He ended the season with six interceptions, three fumble recoveries (one of which he returned for a touchdown), and two forced fumbles. This led to him being selected for the 1992 Pro Bowl, his only Pro Bowl appearance. After the season, he began a holdout, which did not end until September 11, 1992, when he signed a two-year contract. Dishman's production for the 1992 season went down, as he only notched three interceptions for the season. Dishman's 1993 season, however, started off very productively, with the help of new defensive coordinator Buddy Ryan. In the second game of the season against the Chiefs, Dishman had a 58 touchdown run after taking the ball from tight end Mike Dyal. He finished the 1993 season having tied a career-high with six interceptions, forced a career-high four fumbles, and managed an interception in four consecutive games. He notched four interceptions while returning one for a touchdown in 1994, and also managed three during the 1995 season. As a result of his efforts and his contract winding down, Dishman was selected as the franchise player for the 1996 season. In fact, the $2.5 million he made during the 1996 season was the second highest among cornerbacks behind Rod Woodson. However, Dishman finished the season with only one pick. After this performance and being frustrated by losses, as well as the move to Nashville, Dishman filed for free agency after the 1996 season. Later career After Dishman was granted free agency, the Washington Redskins became interested in signing him as an insurance policy should Tom Carter or Darrell Green sign elsewhere. Carter eventually signed with the Chicago Bears, and Cris Dishman was signed to a four-year contract, with the Oilers not making a counteroffer. He platooned with cornerback Darrell Green to become one of the better duos in the NFL. He finished the season with four interceptions, including bringing one back for a touchdown. As a result, he was named an alternate for the 1998 Pro Bowl, and was selected to the 1997 All-Madden team. However, after a disappointing 1998 season and subsequent release, he signed with the Kansas City Chiefs after an impressive workout, filling the void left by Dale Carter. His best game for the Chiefs came on November 28, 1999 against the Oakland Raiders. In this game, Dishman had two defensive touchdowns, one on an interception, and the other on a fumble. Despite five interceptions on the season, Dishman was released by the Chiefs. During the off-season, he signed with the Minnesota Vikings. After playing eleven games for the Vikings, he was cut, and subsequently retired. His release came three weeks after he was embarrassed on Monday Night Football by an improbable Antonio Freeman touchdown catch during overtime. Dishman raised his arms in victory believing he had broken up the pass, thus allowing Freeman to run untouched into the end zone. After retiring, Dishman became a football coach. He started off by taking part in the NFL's Minority Coaching Fellowship program. During the 2006 Miami Dolphins season, Dishman spent training camp as a coach for the Dolphins, alongside Eric Green and Cornell Brown. Shortly afterward, Dishman became the defensive backs coach for Menlo College in 2006, and currently holds the position of defensive coordinator, which he was awarded on February 15, 2007. He spent the summer of 2007 again as part of the minority coaching fellowship, this time as a coach for the Oakland Raiders. On January 21, 2009, Dishman was hired by the San Diego Chargers as an assistant defensive backs coach, helping out newly acquired secondary coach Steven Wilks. On January 14, 2015 Dishman joined the Baylor University football staff coaching Safeties. On May 20, 2018 Dishman joined the Montreal Alouettes as part of the Canadian Football League CFL to coach Defensive Backs. On June 1, 2019, Dishman was named the defensive backs coach for the New York Guardians of the XFL. On July 1, 2020, Dishman was named the defensive backs coach for IMG Academy in Bradenton, FL.

Discovery and naming Silhouette showing the known hand To date, only a single species of Hagryphus has been named in 2005 by Lindsay Zanno and Scott Sampson, the type species Hagryphus giganteus. The generic name is derived from Egyptian Ha, the name of the god of the western desert and a Latinised Greek Œ≥œÅœçœà (gryps) meaning 'griffin' (a mythological bird-like creature). The specific name means \\"gigantic\\" in Latin. The holotype was discovered in 2002 by Michael Getty in the Kaiparowits Formation (Late Campanian) in the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument of southern Utah. The find was scientifically reported in 2003. Radiometric dating of rocks from slightly below the rock bed where the fossil was found indicates that the specimen died 75.95 million years ago. Designated UMNH VP 12765, the type specimen resides in the collections of the Utah Museum of Natural History in Salt Lake City. It consists of an incomplete but articulated left manus and the distal portion of the left radius. The hand lacks the second claw. In the wrist both the semilunate carpal bone and the radiale are preserved. Also some fragmentary foot elements, found at the hillside near the hand, have been catalogued under the same inventory number. Description As the specific name indicates, Hagryphus giganteus was a particularly large oviraptorosaur, estimated by the describers to have been approximately three meters (10 ft) long, which makes it one of the largest members of the clade Oviraptorosauria (Barsbold, 1976), apart from the later described Gigantoraptor. H. giganteus was estimated to have been 30-40% larger than the next largest known North American oviraptorosaur, Chirostenotes. The hand of the holotype was about a foot long. However, later estimates have been lower: Gregory S. Paul in 2010 gave a length of eight feet and a weight of fifty kilogrammes.Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 150 Phylogeny Hypothetical restoration In 2003 Zanno & Sampson reported the new find as a member of the Caenagnathidae. However, in 2005 they limited the precision of the determination to a more general Oviraptorosauria. Hagryphus would then be the southernmost known oviraptorosaurian from the Americas. Other known species of North American oviraptorosaurs include Elmisaurus rarus, Microvenator celer, and Chirostenotes pergracilis. This group of dinosaurs is better known from the Cretaceous of Asia, where forms such as Khaan mckennai, Conchoraptor gracilis and Oviraptor philoceratops have been discovered. Oviraptorosaurs are characterized by a shortened snout, massive endentulous jaws and extensively pneumatized skulls, often sporting elaborate crests, the function of which remains unknown. The toothless jaws have indicate to some a diet of eggs but these theropods more likely fed on plants or small vertebrates. Evidence suggests that they were feathered and some paleontologists consider them to be true birds (see the main article Oviraptorosauria for further information). Paleoecology Habitat The only known specimen of Hagryphus was recovered at the Kaiparowits Formation, in southern Utah. Argon-argon radiometric dating indicates that the Kaiparowits Formation was deposited between 76.1 and 74.0 million years ago, during the Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous period.Roberts EM, Deino AL, Chan MA (2005) 40Ar/39Ar age of the Kaiparowits Formation, southern Utah, and correlation of contemporaneous Campanian strata and vertebrate faunas along the margin of the Western Interior Basin.

Miscellaneous Publication 02-4, Utah Geological Survey, 66 pp. During the Late Cretaceous period, the site of the Kaiparowits Formation was located near the western shore of the Western Interior Seaway, a large inland sea that split North America into two landmasses, Laramidia to the west and Appalachia to the east. The plateau where dinosaurs lived was an ancient floodplain dominated by large channels and abundant wetland peat swamps, ponds and lakes, and was bordered by highlands. The climate was wet and humid, and supported an abundant and diverse range of organisms.Titus, Alan L. and Mark A. Loewen (editors). At the Top of the Grand Staircase: The Late Cretaceous of Southern Utah. 2013. Indiana University Press. Hardbound: 634 pp. This formation contains one of the best and most continuous records of Late Cretaceous terrestrial life in the world. Paleofauna Hagryphus shared its paleoenvironment with theropods such as dromaeosaurids, the troodontid Talos sampsoni, ornithomimids like Ornithomimus velox, tyrannosaurids like Albertosaurus and Teratophoneus, armored ankylosaurids, the duckbilled hadrosaurs Parasaurolophus cyrtocristatus and Gryposaurus monumentensis, and the ceratopsians Utahceratops gettyi, Nasutoceratops titusi and Kosmoceratops richardsoni. Paleofauna present in the Kaiparowits Formation included chondrichthyans (sharks and rays), frogs, salamanders, turtles, lizards and crocodilians. A variety of early mammals were present including multituberculates, metatherians, and eutherians.

Family Joseph Boyle was born in Toronto, Ontario, the son of Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame racehorse trainer Charles Boyle and wife Martha Bain Boyle. His brother, David A. Boyle, would follow in their father's footsteps and become a Thoroughbred racehorse trainer. His family had immigrated from the Ulster region of Ireland (modern Northern Ireland) to Canada in 1839. The Boyle family were Protestants and Unionist in their political sympathies, but he was always proud to call himself a \\"fighting Irishman\\". Through he was born in Toronto, he grew up in Woodstock. Summary Boyle was early to recognize the potential of large- scale gold mining in the Klondike gold fields, and as the initial placer mining operations waned after 1900, Boyle and other companies imported equipment to assemble enormous dredges, usually electric-powered, that took millions more ounces of gold from the creeks while turning the landscape upside-down, shifting creeks. An avid hockey fan, Boyle began in 1902 to sponsor hockey teams to play in Dawson City for the benefit of the miners. Boyle organized an ice hockey team in 1905, often known as the Dawson City Nuggets, that endured a difficult journey to Ottawa, Ontario (by overland sled, train, coastal steamer, then transcontinental train) to play the Ottawa Silver Seven for the Stanley Cup, which until 1924 was awarded to the top ice hockey team in Canada and could be challenged for by a team. Ottawa thrashed the Dawson team. In 1909, he married an American woman, Elma Louise Humphries while on a visit to Detroit. On 4 August 1914, Great Britain declared war on Germany following the invasion of Belgium and Canada as part of the British empire was now at war. On 4 August 1914, Boyle attended a rally at the Dawson City Athletic Association to sing God Save the King and declared his support for the war. Boyle took an ultra-patriotic line, declaring that if any of his employees expressed any sympathy for the enemy, they would be fired immediately. His greatest disappointment came when his attempt to volunteer for the Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF) was turned down on the account of his age, being informed at 46 he was too old for the CEF. During World War I, Boyle organised a machine gun company, giving the soldiers insignia made of gold, to fight in Europe. In 1914, he wrote Sam Hughes, the minister of national defense, offering to raise at his own expense the machine gun company made up of Yukon miners. The company was trained in Dawson City under the direction of the local Royal Northwest Mounted Police detachment and the Dawson City Rifle Association and later received more professional military training when it reached Vancouver. Boyle was present at the parade on 27 October 1914 when the company left Dawson City for Vancouver. Morale problems began in the winter of 1914-1915 when the unit was not deployed to Europe immediately as promised, and were indeed not officially accepted as part of the Canadian Expeditionary Force until 18 February 1915. Boyle wrote several letters to Hughes warning that with the unit living in tents in Hastings Park it would wither away due to desertion if kept there much longer, and finally on 11 June 1915 the \\"Boyle Battery\\" boarded a ship for Britain. On 19 June 1915, a puzzled Boyle wrote to Hughes asking why he had not been presented with the invoice for the costs of raising the \\"Boyle battery\\" and for the purchasing machine guns, insisting he wanted to pay these costs out of his pocket. Only later did Boyle realize that Hughes had promoted such a chaotic mobilization that he had forgotten that Boyle was supposed to pay for the costs of raising the \\"Boyle Battery\\" himself. The unit was incorporated into larger units of the Canadian Army. On 27 July 1916, Boyle left Dawson City for London with the intention of negotiating a deal with the South African Goldfields Company to operate a gold-mining concession in Russia. Boyle was especially interested in the gold fields around the Lena river in Siberia owning to the similarities between Siberia and the Yukon. Hughes was visiting London in August 1916 when Boyle arrived, and thus Boyle finally met the bombastic Defense Minister whom he had corresponding with since August 1914. In September 1916, Hughes appointed Boyle a honorary lieutenant colonel of the militia, allowing Boyle to wear an uniform which he embellished by adding in maple leafs made of Yukon gold. In London, Boyle also met in London a prominent American engineer and businessman, Herbert Hoover, who was a member of the American Committee of Engineers and who had much money invested in Russia. In June 1917, Boyle undertook a mission to Russia on behalf of the American Committee of Engineers in London to help reorganize the country‚Äôs railway system. Boyle arrived in Petrograd (modern St. Petersburg) on 25 June 1917. In December 1917, he successfully petitioned the new Bolshevik government of Russia to return archives and paper currency from the Kremlin to Romania. In February 1918 he served as the principal intermediary on behalf of the Romanian government in effecting a ceasefire with revolutionary forces in Bessarabia. On 23 February 1918, when Romania was on the brink of defeat, Boyle first met Queen Marie, who was lying dejected on her sofa as she heard the news that Romania had asked for an armistice with Germany. Although Marie was only a queen consort, she was vastly more popular with the Romanian people than her husband, King Ferdinand, and it she who was the focal point of popular affection. At the time she vowed: \\"My English blood refuses to accept disaster. If there remains the smallest, most meagre fighting chance, I shall fight on-a losing battle no doubt, but I shall consider myself unworthy of my own ideals were I to give in before I am completely convinced that all is lost\\". Boyle arrival at the Romanian court and his promise as he got on his knees to shake the queen's hand and to swear that he would never abandon her did much to lift her spirits. Marie later wrote of him: \\"I can honestly say that during that dark period of my life, Joe Boyle kept me from despairing...This strong, self-reliant man had been my rock on a stormy sea\\". One biographer of Queen Marie wrote of him: \\"An exaggeration of a man, Colonel Boyle reads today like a fictional hero created by his contemporaries to lighten the frustrations of defeat. Were it not for the corroborating memoirs of his partner, Captain George A. Hill of the British Secret Service, we would write Boyle off as the wish fulfillment of a desperate queen looking for a twentieth-century version of Lancelot\\". Boyle, in cooperation with Captain George Alexander Hill, a Russian-speaking member of the British secret service, carried out clandestine operations against German and Bolshevik forces in Bessarabia and southwestern Russia. Just one of their many exploits together had been secreting the Romanian crown jewels and Romanian treasury out of the Kremlin and back into Romania. In March‚ÄìApril 1918, he rescued some 50 high-ranking Rumanians held in Odessa by revolutionaries. This made Boyle a national hero in Romania and gave him influence within its royal court. At a time when defeatism was rampant in Romania, Boyle together with Queen Marie and her lover, Prince Barbu »òtirbey were the main advocates that the Allies would still win the war. Over the queen's strong opposition, Romania signed on 7 May 1918 the humiliating Treaty of Bucharest. One of the terms of the Treaty of Bucharest was that German civil servants were to be placed in charge of every Romanian ministry with the power to veto decisions by Romanian cabinet ministers and to fire Romanian civil servants, a clause which effectively stripped Romania of its independence and turned it into a German protectorate. Other terms of the treaty subjected Romania to a ruthless policy of economic exploitation, which caused living standards in Romania to collapse. Marie spent much of her fortune on charity attempting to assist her destitute people, an endeavour in which Boyle joined in, spending much of his own fortune on charity. Adding to Marie's woes, on 31 August 1918, the Crown Prince Carol, whose debauchery and dissolute ways had often worried her, impulsively deserted his Romanian Army unit and eloped to marry in Odessa Zizi Lambrino. Marie was strongly opposed to her son's marriage to Lambrino and feared the fact he had deserted his unit would discredit the monarchy. Boyle provided the queen much emotional support as she later wrote that Carol's actions were \\"a staggering family tragedy which hit us suddenly, a stunning blow for which we were entirely unprepared. I felt myself very sick. Carol! My honest big boy, at such a moment when the country is in such a state, when all our moral courage is needed, when we, the Royal Family, are the only thing that holds it together. I was completely crushed. Only Boyle and Barbu knew\\". Boyle advised Marie to be strict with Carol, who technically could had been executed for desertion, arguing that if Carol was not punished in some way, then the monarchy would be discredited with the Romanian people. Boyle realized that as the Romanian Army had executed a number of men for desertion during the war that to allow Carol to escape unpunished for doing the same thing that commoners were executed for would ruin the prestige of the monarchy. Carol was banished to a remote Orthodox monastery located high up in the Carpathian mountains with instructions that he would be released only after he agreed to annul his marriage to the commoner Zambrino and publicly apologise for deserting his unit. Marie visited the monastery to inform him that King Ferdinand was planning to exclude him from the succession unless he met their conditions. When Marie could not convince Carol that she was serious with this threat, Boyle visited Carol at the monastery on her behalf and was more successful. When Boyle returned to tell the queen that Carol had agreed, she wrote: \\"Boyle was as near tears as a man can be, it was a cruel and sickening victory...Nando [her pet name for Ferdinand] and I both thanked Boyle with emotion\\". On 8 November 1918, Romania renounced the Treaty of Bucharest and declared war again on the Austrian Empire and Germany, thus technically making Romania one of the victorious allies. Through Romania was finally able to gain Transylvania, Marie confessed to Boyle that she was highly worried about the future, writing to him: \\"The main dangers and difficulties are, it seems, the famine danger and a strong Bolshevik propaganda conducted by the Germans in the occupied territories, a ruthless propaganda because they carry with them whatever could be carried, and the empty stomach doesn't reason. The theory is: if they fall, they want Romania to sink first, to be totally destroyed under all aspects; but we don't want it destroyed, do we?\\" Marie was the driving force behind the promise issued by King Ferdinand that to reward his subjects for their wartime suffering, then postwar Romania would pursue land reform, breaking up the estates of the boyars (nobility) to provide land for their peasants and provide universal suffrage. At the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 he was instrumental in helping Romania to obtain a $25-million credit from the Canadian government. He was awarded the special title of \\"Saviour of Romania\\". He remained a close friend, and was at one time a possible lover of the Romanian Queen, British-born Marie of Edinburgh (better known as Marie of Romania). On the Queen's behalf, Boyle organized millions of dollars of Canadian relief for Romanians, earning the title of hero. He was decorated for his exploits by the governments of Russia, France, Britain and Romania. Queen Marie, who was notably fond of him, made him the Duke of Jassy. His relationship with the queen remains something of a mystery. Some historians speculated they were lovers and point to a mysterious woman in black who is said to have brought flowers to his grave every year on the anniversary of his death in 1923. Queen Marie died in 1938 and nobody appeared at his grave after that year, so it was always thought that she was the mystery woman. Boyle died at 'Wayside' in St James's Road, Hampton Hill, on 14 April 1923. His remains were buried in the churchyard of St James's on 17 April 1923Richmond-upon-Thames, St James, Hampton Hill.

History Olive Pink - founder of the garden The 16 ha area that is now Olive Pink Botanic Garden was gazetted in 1956 as the Australian Arid Regions Flora Reserve after intense lobbying by the Garden's founder, and first honorary curator, Olive Muriel Pink. The Garden is part of a substantial area of contiguous Crown Land that extends east from the Todd River on the southern edge of Alice Springs' central business district. Prior to 1956 the land was unoccupied and grazed variously by feral goat, rabbit, and cattle populations, such that the vegetation on the floodplain was substantially modified and devoid of tree and shrub cover when Pink took up occupancy there in 1956. Pink, with her Warlpiri assistant gardeners, spent the next two decades battling drought conditions and almost non-existent operational funding to develop her vision for the Reserve. Together they planted a somewhat eclectic collection of trees and shrubs native to the central Australian region as well as various cacti, garden flowers, and introduced trees around Home Hut that could withstand the harsh summers. After Pink's death in 1975, the NT Government assumed control of the reserve and set about fulfilling Miss Pink's vision of a public area for the appreciation of native flora. During the next decade networks of walking tracks were put in place, the Visitor Centre built, extensive plantings of mulga, red gums and various other tree species established, a waterhole and sand dune habitat created, and an interpretive display installed. The Garden opened to the public in 1985 as the Olive Pink Flora Reserve, and was renamed Olive Pink Botanic Garden in 1996. The Garden is managed by a voluntary Board of Trustees which has employed a succession of curators to manage the expanding plantings and visitors' experience of the reserve. Olive Pink Botanic Garden was listed on the Register of the National Estate on 30 May 1995, and on the Northern Territory Heritage Register on 18 March 2009, because of its strong links to Miss Olive Pink, anthropologist, campaigner for Aboriginal social justice, artist and visionary gardener.

This station is on the West Highland Line and is a boundary station for SPT.  History  This station opened to passengers on 7 August 1894. The station was laid out with a crossing loop and an island platform. There were sidings on both sides, and a turntable on the west side of the line. The station was host to a LNER camping coach from 1935 to 1939. A camping coach was also positioned here by the Scottish Region from 1964 to 1967. Until the 1960s, the station was served by a local shuttle service between Craigendoran and in addition to main line trains to Fort William and Mallaig. Latterly operated by a Wickham diesel railbus, it fell victim to the Beeching Axe in June 1964. The siding on the east side was removed in 1983. On 15 February 1987, the crossing loop was altered to right-hand running. The original Down platform has thus become the Up platform, and vice versa. The change was made to simplify shunting at this station, by removing the need to hand-pump the train-operated loop points to access the siding.  Signalling  From the time of its opening in 1894, the West Highland Railway was worked throughout by the electric token system. Garelochhead signal box, which had 18 levers, was situated on the island platform. The semaphore signals were removed on 2 February 1986 in preparation for the introduction of Radio Electronic Token Block (RETB) by British Rail. The RETB, which is controlled from a Signalling Centre at Banavie railway station, was commissioned between and on 27 March 1988. The Train Protection & Warning System was installed in 2003.  Services   2011  Mondays to Saturdays, there are three services to Oban and Mallaig and one service to Fort William (Highland Caledonian Sleeper) northbound. Southbound, there are four services to Glasgow Queen Street (three on Saturdays) and one service to London Euston (Highland Caledonian Sleeper does not run on Saturday). On Sundays, there is just one train northbound to Oban and Mallaig and two trains southbound to Glasgow Queen Street and London Euston.  2019  Mondays to Saturdays, there are six trains to Oban and three to Mallaig each day northbound (three of the Oban services run combined with those to Mallaig, splitting at ), plus the Highland Sleeper to Fort William. Southbound, there are six trains to Glasgow Queen Street High Level plus the sleeper to Edinburgh Waverley and London Euston (this calls at Queen Street Low Level to set down only and does not run on Saturday evenings).

Critics say that such intervention, particularly by the Allied governments, might have saved substantial numbers of people and could have been accomplished without the diversion of significant resources from the war effort.; ; . Other researchers have challenged such criticism. Some have argued that the idea that the Allies took no action is a myth‚Äîthat the Allies accepted as many German Jewish immigrants as the Nazis would allow‚Äîand that theoretical military action by the Allies, such as bombing the Auschwitz concentration camp, would have saved the lives of very few people.. Others have said that the limited intelligence available to the Allies‚Äîwho, as late as October 1944, did not know the locations of many of the Nazi death camps or the purposes of the various buildings within those camps they had identified‚Äîmade precision bombing impossible.. In three cases, entire countries resisted the deportation of their Jewish population during the Holocaust. In other countries, notable individuals or communities created resistance during the Holocaust. Allied nations' response during Nazi persecution :See also: Auschwitz bombing debate, The Voyage of the Damned, Joint Declaration by Members of the United Nations While the Polish government-in-exile managed to raise awareness of the Jewish genocide among the Allies by December 1942,Titled \\"The Mass Extermination of the Jews in German Occupied Poland\\", the report provided a detailed account of the conditions in the ghettos and their liquidation. this did not result in any on-the-ground action by Allied nations to either stop the ongoing slaughter of millions of Jews and other minorities, or to save and absorb refugees. Rather, the Allies focused their efforts exclusively on conducting a wholesale military campaign in order to defeat the Third Reich. Britain By 1939, about 304,000 of about 522,000 German Jews had fled Germany, including 60,000 to British Mandate Palestine (including over 50,000 who had taken advantage of the Haavara, or \\"Transfer\\" Agreement between German Zionists and the Nazis), but British immigration quotas prevented many from migrating.US Holocaust Museum Holocaust Encyclopedia: \\"Refugees\\" and \\"German Jewish Refugees 1933-1939\\" In March 1938, Hitler annexed Austria and made the 200,000 Jews of Austria stateless refugees. In September, Britain and France granted Hitler the right to occupy the Sudetenland of Czechoslovakia, and in March 1939, Hitler occupied the remainder of the country, making a further 200,000 Jews stateless. In 1939, British policy as stated in its 1939 White Paper capped Jewish immigration to Palestine (then a British mandate) at 75,000 over the next five years, after which the country was to become an independent state. Britain had offered homes for Jewish immigrant children and proposed Kenya as a haven for Jews, but refused to back a Jewish state or facilitate Jewish settlement, contravening the terms of the League of Nations Mandate over Palestine. Before, during and after the war, the British government obstructed Jewish immigration to Mandatory Palestine so as to avoid a negative reaction from Palestinian Arabs. In the summer of 1941, however, Chaim Weizmann estimated that with the British ban on Jewish immigration, when the war was over, it would take two decades to get 1.5 million Jews to Palestine from Europe through clandestine immigration; David Ben-Gurion had originally believed 3 million could be brought in ten years. Thus Palestine it has been argued by at least one writer, once war had begun‚Äîcould not have been the saviour of anything other than a small minority of those Jews murdered by the Nazis.. The British Government, along with all UN member nations, received credible evidence about the Nazi attempts to exterminate the European Jewry as early as 1942 from the Polish Government-in-exile. Titled \\"The Mass Extermination of the Jews in German Occupied Poland\\", the report provided a detailed account of the conditions in the ghettos and their liquidation. Additionally the Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden met with Jan Karski, courier to the Polish resistance who, having been smuggled into the Warsaw ghetto by the Jewish underground, as well as having posed as an Estonian guard at Be≈Ç≈ºec transit camp, provided him with detailed eyewitness accounts of Nazi atrocities against the Jews.Karski, Jan Story of a Secret State, 2013 Georgetown University Press http://press.georgetown.edu/book/georgetown/story- secret-stateNigel Jones (4 May 2011). \\"Story of a Secret State by Jan Karski: review\\". The daily telegraph. Karski reached London where he had an interview with the foreign secretary Anthony Eden, the first of many top officials to effectively ignore his account of the Nazis' systematic effort to exterminate European Jewry. The very enormity of Karski's report paradoxically worked against him being believed, and paralysed any action against the killings. Logistically unable to reach Poland, preoccupied with fighting the war on many fronts, and unwilling to believe even the Nazis capable of such bestiality, the Allies put the Holocaust on the back burner. When Karski took his tale across the Atlantic, the story was the same. President Roosevelt heard him out, then asked about the condition of horses in Poland.\\" These lobbying efforts triggered the Joint Declaration by Members of the United Nations of 17 December 1942 which made public and condemned the mass extermination of the Jews in Nazi-occupied Poland. The statement was read to British House of Commons in a floor speech by Foreign secretary Anthony Eden, and published on the front page of the New York Times and many other newspapers. BBC radio aired two broadcasts on the final solution during the war: the first at 9am on 17 December 1942, on the UN Joint Declaration, read by Polish Foreign Minister in-exile Edward Raczynski, and the second during May 1943, Jan Karski's eyewitness account of mass Jewish executions, read by Arthur Koestler.Karski, Jan Story of a Secret State: My Report to the World, Penguin Classics, 2nd edition (2011) Appendix p.3 http://press.georgetown.edu/book/georgetown/story- secret-state However, the political rhetoric and public reporting was not followed up with military action by the British Government- an omission that has been the source of significant historical debate. See also: Auschwitz bombing debate Denmark Denmark was the only Nazi-occupied country that managed to save 95% of its Jewish residents. Following a tip-off by a German diplomat, thousands of Jews were evacuated to neutral Sweden. Netherlands A general strike was organized on February 25, 1941, against the anti-Jewish measures and activities by the Nazis. By February 27, much of it had been suppressed by the German police. Although ultimately unsuccessful, it was still significant in that it was the first direct action against the Nazis' treatment of Jews. Poland \\"The Mass Extermination of Jews in German Occupied Poland\\", by the Polish government-in-exile addressed to the wartime allies of the then-United Nations, 1942 The Nazis built the majority of their death camps in German occupied Poland which had a Jewish population of 3.3 million. From 1941 on, the Polish government-in-exile in London played an essential part in revealing Nazi crimes providing the Allies with some of the earliest and most accurate accounts of the ongoing Holocaust of European Jews.Krzysztof Kania, Edward Raczynski, 1891-1993, Dyplomata i Polityk (Edward Raczynski, 1891-1993, Diplomat and Politician), Wydawnictwo Neriton, Warszawa, 2014, p. 232Martin Gilbert, Auschwitz and the Allies, 1981 (Pimlico edition, p.101) \\"On December 10, the Polish Ambassador in London, Edward Raczynski sent Eden an extremely detailed twenty-one point summary of all the most recent information regarding the killing of Jews in Poland; confirmation, he wrote, \\"that the German authorities aim with systematic deliberation at the total extermination of the Jewish population of Poland\\" as well as of the \\"many thousands of Jews\\" whom the Germans had deported to Poland from western and Central Europe, and from the German Reich itself.\\" Titled \\"The Mass Extermination of the Jews in German Occupied Poland\\", the report provided a detailed account of the conditions in the ghettos and their liquidation.Engel (2014) Though its representatives, like the Foreign Minister Count Edward Raczy≈Ñski and the courier of the Polish Underground movement, Jan Karski, called for action to stop it, they were unsuccessful. Most notably, Jan Karski met with British Foreign Secretary, Anthony Eden as well as US President Franklin D. Roosevelt, providing the earliest eyewitness accounts of the Holocaust.The meeting with Roosevelt occurred in the Oval Office on 28 July 1943 \\"Algemeiner 07/17/2013\\". Algemeiner.com. 2013-07-17.

Karski said to Roosevelt, \\"All hope, Mr. President, has been placed by the Polish nation in the hands of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Karski says that he told President Roosevelt about Belzec and the desperate situation of the Jews. Roosevelt concentrated his questions and remarks entirely on Poland and did not ask one question about the Jews \\". Watch the video, or see the full transcript The report that the Polish Foreign Minister in-exile, Count Edward Raczynski sent on 10 December 1942, to all the Governments of the United Nations was the first official denunciation by any Government of the mass extermination and of the Nazi aim of total annihilation of the Jewish population. It was also the first official document singling out the sufferings of European Jews as Jews and not only as citizens of their respective countries of origin. The report of 10 December 1942 and the Polish Government's lobbying efforts triggered the Joint Declaration by Members of the United Nations of 17 December 1942 which made public and condemned the mass extermination of the Jews in German-occupied Poland. The statement was read to British House of Commons in a floor speech by Foreign secretary Anthony Eden, and published on the front page of the New York Times and many other newspapers.

Karski, Jan Story of a Secret State: My Report to the World, Penguin Classics, 2nd edition (2011) Appendix p.3 This rhetoric, however, was not followed up by military action by Allied nations. During an interview with Hannah Rosen in 1995, Karski said about the failure to rescue most of the Jews from mass murder, \\"The Allies considered it impossible and too costly to rescue the Jews, because they didn't do it. The Jews were abandoned by all governments, church hierarchies and societies, but thousands of Jews survived because thousands of individuals in Poland, France, Belgium, Denmark, Holland helped to save Jews.\\" \\"Interview with Jan Karski\\". Retrieved 2007-09-30. In the absence of international intervention, it fell upon individual Poles and local underground organisations to assist Jewish escapees. This was challenging as the Nazis issued the death penalty for anybody 'hiding a Jew, feeding a Jew or selling food to a Jew,' which frightened many people out of helping Jewish escapees as well as created a fertile ground for blackmailers.Mordecai Paldiel, The Path of the Righteous: Gentile Rescuers of Jews, page 184. Published by KTAV Publishing House Inc. Additionally the Nazis incentivised denunciations by rewarding the reporting of Jewish escapees with additional food rations. Nonetheless, many individuals did risk their lives to feed and house the over 300,000 survivors within Nazi occupied Poland.Only 100,000 Jews survived in the western Nazi annexed half, while 200,000 survived in the initially Soviet annexed half which was conquered by the Nazis from late 1941 Most effective, was the underground organisation ≈ªegota, the Council to Aid Jews, which although founded by Catholics, became a successful joint Catholic-Jewish operation with around 100 cells.Joseph Kermish, The Activities of the Council for Aid to Jews (\\"≈ªegota\\") In Occupied Poland.

See also \\"Polish Victims\\". Holocaust Encyclopedia ‚Äì USHMM. Retrieved 1 June 2016. After the war Poland defied both Britain and Stalin, allowing Jewish emigration to British Mandate Palestine. Around 200,000 Jews availed themselves of this opportunity, leaving only around 100,000 Jews in Poland. Scandinavia Norway and Denmark had a Jewish population of 10,000 between them. Acting on a Swedish offer of refuge, Denmark saved almost all its Jewish citizens, while Norway only managed to save about half.. After the liberation of the concentration camps, Sweden accepted thousands of survivors for medical treatment.. Switzerland Of the five neutral countries of continental Europe, Switzerland has the distinction of being the only one to have promulgated a German antisemitic law. (Excluding city-states, the five neutrals were Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and Turkey.) The country closed its French border to refugees for a period from 13 August 1942, and did not allow unfettered access to Jews seeking refuge until 12 July 1944. In 1942 the President of the Swiss Confederation, Philipp Etter as a member of the Geneva-based ICRC even persuaded the committee not to issue a condemnatory proclamation concerning German \\"attacks\\" against \\"certain categories of nationalities\\".. As can be seen, the proclamation's description of Nazi crimes was vague, and would not even have explicitly mentioned the word Jews.. United States In 1924, the Johnson Reed Act was passed limiting the number of Jewish people, as well as other groups, allowed to immigrate to the United States. These limitations were mostly due to anti-Semitic sentiments held by the public during this time. As a result, when the Nazis came to power in Germany, it was already more difficult to immigrate to the United States due to the restrictions placed on them before WWII broke out. Prior to the Holocaust, the United States participated in the Evian Conference, an international conference held in July 1938 to decide how to best to handle the mounting Jewish refugee crisis. Participants in the Conference were Bolivia, Brazil, United Kingdom, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, France, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Ireland, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Norway, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Sweden, Switzerland, the United States, Uruguay, and Venezuela. However, the United States did not increase the amount of refugees they let into the country, \\"citing continued economic hardship resulting from the worldwide depression\\" as the reason why no refugees could be taken in. The lack of decisive action by world leaders led to many Jews attempting to escape Nazi persecution having no place to turn to for safety. The Roosevelt administration and the president himself were not ardent advocates of the Holocaust victims. Another iniative taken by the US to try to help Jewish refugees was the introduction of the Wagner Rogers Bill in 1938. \\"The Wagner-Rogers Bill, named for Senator Robert Wagner of New York and Representative Edith Rogers of Massachusetts and introduced in February 1939, sought to allow the entry of 20,000 refugee children from Germany\\". The bill was intended to give refuge to German-Jewish children who were facing increased discrimination against them in Germany. However, the bill didn't garner enough support from the public and was not ever able to pass, therefore forcing these children to have to remain in Germany. \\"The bill caused a loud and bitter public debate, but it never even reached a vote in Congress\\". Anti-semitic sentiments were very common at this time, and as a result, many Americans did not want Jewish refugees to be resettled in the country. Such sentiments can be attributed to scapegoating Jewish people for the nation's internal problems, as well as the negative stereotyping of Jewish people. According to Peter Novick, \\"Americans, including many American Jews, were largely unaware of what we now call the Holocaust while it was going on; the nation was preoccupied with defeating the Axis.\\". Some awareness of Germany's harsh treatment of Jews in Europe, especially Poland, existed; H. R. Knickerbocker wrote in 1941, \\"Poland must come in a separate category since there Hitler has apparently set out to exterminate the 3,000,000 Jews without the restraint he seems to have put on himself elsewhere ... the obvious intent of the Germans in Poland is to wipe out the Jews altogether, and the wonder is that any at all are living today.\\" In June 1941, Dr. Gerhart Riegner attempted to notify a prominent American rabbi Stephen Wise about the Holocaust that was happening to the European Jews. At this point, the Nazis were trying to keep the genocide a secret and therefore little was known about it in the United States. Riegner informed the US State Department of his findings, asking them to relay the message to Wise. However, the State Department never did, keeping the events of the Holocaust very unknown to many in the United States. Had the telegram been received, the course of this era in history may have been dramatically different because there may have been more public knowledge about the Holocaust and therefore public opinion may have influenced government policy towards Jewish asylum seekers. By the end of 1942 the US government had adequate evidence to conclude that a campaign to annihilate the Jews of Europe was underway.. Like the other Allies, the United States decided not to bomb the Auschwitz extermination camp out of commission, even as American heavy bombers staged several attacks nearby.. Regarding the decision not to bomb Auschwitz, several scholars believe \\"this notorious nonevent tends to become the central symbol of the Allies' response to the Holocaust\\". This is because the bombing of Auschwitz could have had a significant impact on Jewish casualties, but, like many other aspects of American foreign policy regarding the Holocaust, no preventative actions were taken. (See Auschwitz bombing debate.) The United States also refused to grant temporary refuge to Jews fleeing Europe. In the wake of the Great Depression, the United States had a highly restrictive immigration quota system, but even the limited quota spots were not filled.. The Department of State refused to fill 90% of the quota spots that might have been available for European Jews..America and the Holocaust: Breckinridge Long, PBS. In 1939, German Jewish citizens traveling on the passenger ship St. Louis in order to escape Nazi persecution were unable to dock in any American ports. Because they were not allowed to dock and unload in the United States, Cuba, or Canada, the ship was forced to turn around and head back to Europe, forcing Jewish refugees to go back to very area they were trying to flee. In 998 press conferences, during more than a decade in office served wholly within the Nazi era, President Roosevelt never delivered the \\"appeal to the German people\\" regarding the Reich's treatment of Jews that he said he would.. Roosevelt's failure to take decisive, preventative action regarding the Holocaust is still a stain on American foreign policy, according to many scholars.\\"The callous neglect by the Roosevelt Administration of the fate of European Jewry through the Nazi holocaust lingers to haunt one's faith in the abiding humane traditions of American foreign policy\\". It was Treasury official Josiah DuBois authored the \\"Report to the Secretary on the Acquiescence of this Government in the Murder of the Jews\\" that documented State Department efforts to thwart Jewish immigration from Europe.. It was DuBois's report that furnished Treasury Secretary Morgenthau with the ammunition he needed to force Roosevelt into creating the War Refugee Board.. Morgenthau did not believe the president was doing enough to help European Jews escape the Holocaust. Because of this he urged Roosevelt to create government committee to address the Holocaust which, by this time, had already been going on for around five years. Before, during and after World War II, The New York Times maintained a general policy to minimize reporting on the Holocaust. To this end, it placed such reportage deep inside its daily editions, while obscuring in those stories the special impact of the Nazis' crimes on Jews in particular.. The New York Times did however publish the Joint Declaration by Members of the United Nations of 17 December 1942 on its front page which was a joint declaration by eleven Allied nations publicly condemning the mass extermination of the Jews in Nazi-occupied Poland. =The Ickes plan for Alaska= In November 1938, two weeks after Kristallnacht, United States Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes proposed the use of Alaska as a \\"haven for Jewish refugees from Germany and other areas in Europe where the Jews are subjected to oppressive restrictions.\\" Resettlement in Alaska would allow the refugees to bypass normal immigration quotas, because Alaska was a territory and not a state. That summer Ickes had toured Alaska and met with local officials to discuss improving the local economy and bolstering security in a territory viewed as vulnerable to Japanese attack. Ickes thought European Jews might be the solution. In his proposal, Ickes pointed out that 200 families from the dustbowl had settled in Alaska's Matanuska Valley. The plan was introduced as a bill by Senator William King (Utah) and Representative Franck Havenner (California), both Democrats. The Alaska proposal won the support of theologian Paul Tillich, the Federal Council of Churches and the American Friends Service Committee. But the plan won little support from American Jews, with the exception of the Labor Zionists of America. Most Jews agreed with Rabbi Stephen Wise, president of the American Jewish Congress, that adoption of the Alaska proposal would deliver \\"a wrong and hurtful impression...that Jews are taking over some part of the country for settlement.\\" The plan was dealt a severe blow when Roosevelt told Ickes that he insisted on limiting the number of refugees to 10,000 a year for five years, and with a further restriction that Jews not make up more than 10% of the refugees. Roosevelt never mentioned the Alaska proposal in public, and without his support the plan died. =Internment camp in New York State= From August 1944 to February 1946, 982 refugees from eighteen different countries were interned at Fort Ontario Emergency Refugee Shelter as operation \\"Safe Haven.\\" This was sited at Fort Ontario, in Oswego, New York, a port on the southern shore of Lake Ontario. This was the only attempt by the United States government to shelter Jewish refugees during the war. Jewish issue at international conferences √âvian Conference The √âvian Conference was convened at the initiative of Franklin D. Roosevelt in July 1938 to discuss the problem of Jewish refugees. For ten days, from July 6 to July 15, delegates from thirty-two countries met at √âvian-les-Bains, France. However, most western countries were reluctant to accept Jewish refugees, and the question was not resolved. The Dominican Republic was the only country willing to accept Jewish refugees‚Äîup to 100,000. Bermuda Conference The UK and the US met in Bermuda in April 1943 to discuss the issue of Jewish refugees who had been liberated by Allied forces and the Jews who remained in Nazi-occupied Europe. The Bermuda Conference led to no change in policy; the Americans would not change their immigration quotas to accept the refugees, and the British would not alter its immigration policy to permit them to enter Palestine.. The failure of the Bermuda Conference prompted U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau, the only Jewish member of Franklin D. Roosevelt's cabinet, to publish a white paper entitled Report to the Secretary on the Acquiescence of this Government to the Murder of the Jews.Text of report, at website of TV show American Experience, a program shown on PBS. This led to the creation of a new agency, the War Refugee Board. International Committee of the Red Cross The International Committee of the Red Cross did relatively little to save Jews during the Holocaust and discounted reports of the organized Nazi genocide, such as of the murder of Polish Jewish prisoners that took place at Lublin. At the time, the Red Cross justified its inaction by suggesting that aiding Jewish prisoners would harm its ability to help other Allied POWs. In addition, the Red Cross claimed that if it would take a major stance to improve the situation of those European Jews, the neutrality of Switzerland, where the International Red Cross was based, would be jeopardized. Today, the Red Cross acknowledges its passivity during the Holocaust and has apologized for this. Japanese response during Holocaust In 1936, German-Japanese Pact was concluded between Nazi Germany and Japan.. However, on December 6, 1938, the Japanese government made a decision of prohibiting the expulsion of the Jews in Japan, Manchukuo, and the rest of Japanese-occupied China.. On December 31, Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka told the Japanese Army and Navy to receive Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany. Diplomat Chiune Sugihara granted more than 2,000 transit visas and saved 6,000 Jewish refugees from Lithuania.. Manchukuo General Hideki Tojo and Lt. Gen. Kiichiro Higuchi observed Japanese national policy as headquarters of the Kwantung Army against German oppositions.. Vatican The pontificate of Pius XII coincided with the Second World War and the Nazi Holocaust, which saw the industrialized mass murder of millions of Jews and others by Adolf Hitler's Germany. Pius employed diplomacy to aid the victims of the Nazis during the war and, through directing his Church to provide discreet aid to Jews, saved thousands of lives.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: \\"Reflections on the Holocaust\\" Pius maintained links to the German Resistance, and shared intelligence with the Allies. His strongest public condemnation of genocide was, however, considered inadequate by the Allied Powers, while the Nazis viewed him as an Allied sympathizer who had dishonoured his policy of Vatican neutrality.\\"\\"Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: \\"Roman Catholicism\\" ‚Äì the period of the world wars. In Rome action was taken to save many Jews in Italy from deportation, including sheltering several hundred Jews in the catacombs of St. Peter's Basilica. In his Christmas addresses of 1941 and 1942, the pontiff was forceful on the topic but did not mention the Nazis by name. The Pope encouraged the bishops to speak out against the Nazi regime and to open the religious houses in their dioceses to hide Jews. At Christmas 1942, once evidence of the industrial slaughter of the Jews had emerged, he voiced concern at the murder of \\"hundreds of thousands\\" of \\"faultless\\" people because of their \\"nationality or race\\". Pius intervened to attempt to block Nazi deportations of Jews in various countries from 1942‚Äì1944. When 60,000 German soldiers and the Gestapo occupied Rome in 1943, thousands of Jews were hiding in churches, convents, rectories, the Vatican and the papal summer residence. According to Joseph Lichten, the Vatican was called upon by the Jewish Community Council in Rome to help fill a Nazi demand of one hundred pounds of gold. The Council had been able to muster seventy pounds, but unless the entire amount was produced within thirty-six hours had been told three hundred Jews would be imprisoned. The Pope granted the request, according to Chief Rabbi Zolli of Rome.Lichten, p. 120 Despite the payment of the ransom 2,091 Jews were deported on October 16, 1943, and most of them died in Germany. Upon his death in 1958, Pius was praised emphatically by the Israeli Foreign Minister and other world leaders. But his insistence on Vatican neutrality and avoidance of naming the Nazis as the evildoers of the conflict became the foundation for contemporary and later criticisms from some quarters. Studies of the Vatican archives and international diplomatic correspondence continue. Response after the Holocaust Nuremberg Trials The international response to the war crimes of World War II and the Holocaust was to establish the Nuremberg international tribunal. Three major wartime powers, the US, USSR and Great Britain, agreed to punish those responsible. The trials brought human rights into the domain of global politics, redefined morality at the global level, and gave political currency to the concept of crimes against humanity, where individuals rather than governments were held accountable for war crimes.. Genocide Towards the end of World War II, Raphael Lemkin, a lawyer of Polish-Jewish descent, aggressively pursued within the halls of the United Nations and the United States government the recognition of genocide as a crime. Largely due to his efforts and the support of his lobby, the United Nations was propelled into action. In response to Lemkin's arguments, the United Nations adopted the term in 1948 when it passed the \\"Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide\\".. Universal Declaration of Human Rights Many believe that the extermination of Jews during the Holocaust inspired the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1948. This view has been challenged by recent historical scholarship. One study has shown that the Nazi slaughter of Jews went entirely unmentioned during the drafting of the Universal Declaration at the United Nations, though those involved in the negotiations did not hesitate to name many other examples of Nazi human rights violations.Duranti, Marco. 'The Holocaust, the Legacy of 1789 and the Birth of International Human Rights Law.' Journal of Genocide Research, Vol 14, No. 2 (2012).' Other historians have countered that the human rights activism of the delegate Ren√© Cassin of France, who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1968 for his work on the Universal Declaration, was motivated in part by the death of many Jewish relatives in the Holocaust and his involvement in Jewish organisations providing aid to Holocaust survivors.Winter, Jay and Antoine Prost. Ren√© Cassin and Human Rights: From the Great War to the Universal Declaration (Cambridge University Press, 2013), p. 346.

It was part of the Jewish community compound, which also included ritual buildings and a school. In February 2006, the Government of Tajikistan began demolition of the Jewish community compound as part of an urban redevelopment plan designed to make way for a new presidential residence, the Palace of Nations, with adjoining landscaped areas. The demolition of the synagogue was delayed due to international protests and a series of court actions until the end of June 2008, when the old building was finally razed.Dushanbe synagogue demolished, 26 June 2008 Tajikistan's only synagogue razed, 29 June 2008 The former synagogue building Built by the Bukharian Jewish community more than a hundred years ago, in the late 19th century, the synagogue was seized by the Soviets in 1920 and nationalized in 1952. The Jewish community was again allowed access to the building in 1958, although the land remained in government hands (as all land was and still is state-owned in Tajikistan). The synagogue functioned after Tajikistan's independence in 1991 and throughout its civil war from 1992 to 1997. It was vandalized in 1995 in an incident which also included the ransacking of Jewish homes. In May 2003, the Jewish community received an official letter ordering them to vacate the buildings, including the synagogue, by July of that year. Demolition, originally scheduled for 2004, began in early February 2006 with the destruction of the community's mikvah, or ritual bath, kosher butcher, and classrooms.Demolition of country's only synagogue begins 22 February 2006 Demolition of the synagogue was delayed until June 2008 due to international protests and a series of court actions.

This was the last remaining synagogue in Tajikistan. While the government argued that the building was of no historical significance and could be demolished in accordance with city planning needs, the Jewish community stated that, as the last remaining Jewish house of prayer in a country that had been a home to Jews for at least two thousand years, the building was of considerable historical significance. The ownership of the building was also disputed. The Jewish community reported that it had documentation of its original (pre- Soviet) ownership of the building and the purchase of the land on which the synagogue had been constructed. The Dushanbe municipal authorities argued, on the other hand, that the state owned the land and the building since it underwent nationalisation in 1952 by the Soviet authorities.Dushanbe Jews ordered to vacate synagogue by July, Forum 18 News Service, 21 May 2004 Old Synagogue, Dushanbe (courtyard), June 2006 Back in 2004, the Chief Rabbi of Central Asia, Rabbi Abraham Dovid Gurevich, raised the issue of antisemitism, hinting that the prospect of a synagogue standing next to the Palace of Nations would cause embarrassment to the authorities, but the US State Department framed the issue as \\"bureaucratic, rather than ideological\\".Tajikistan, International Religious Freedom Report 2004 - US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, 14 September 2004 UNESCO wrote a letter to the government of Tajikistan in 2004 that destruction of the synagogue would be in \\"contradiction with international standards for the protection of cultural heritage\\".Save Dushanbe's synagogue - Jerusalem Post Web site 2 March 2006 The BBC reported in 2006 that \\"those opposed to the demolition had been threatened by officials and most of the congregation are afraid to speak out\\".

Varennikov finished the German‚ÄìSoviet War in the Battle of Berlin as one of the commanders of the Soviet soldiers who captured the Reichstag. Varennikov stayed in East Germany as an officer of the Soviet troops, stationed there until 1950. In 1954 he graduated from the Frunze Military Academy in Moscow. Later he graduated from the General Staff Academy. In 1960 he became deputy commander of a motor rifle division. From 1962 to 1966 Varennikov commanded the 54th Motor Rifle Division of the Leningrad Military District. In 1964 armed forces inspectors tested the division, and it was awarded as one of the six top divisions of the Ground Forces of the USSR Armed Forces by order of the Minister of Defence.Valentin Varennikov, http://lib.rus.ec/b/280137/read In August 1965 he was enrolled in the General Staff Academy. From 1967 to 1969 he commanded the 26th Army Corps of the Leningrad Military District. In 1969 Varennikov took charge of the 3rd Shock Army, and in 1979 became a deputy chief of the Soviet General Staff. Between 1984 and 1985, Varennikov worked with the Soviet military mission in Angola, then in the throes of a bloody civil war. In a sharp contrast with the official policy of only permitting Soviet military advisers to serve in non- combat roles, Varennikov supported allowing the advisers to fight alongside their Angolan allies in the event they came under attack. He was the senior Soviet general officer in Angola during Operation Askari, and personally advised Angolan President Jos√© Eduardo dos Santos on defensive measures to counter the South African incursion. During the last few years of the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War, Varennikov was the personal representative in Kabul of the Soviet Defence Minister and held negotiations with the United Nations Good Offices Mission in Afghanistan and Pakistan members who oversaw the pullout from the country of Soviet troops between 1988 and 1989. In 1989 General Varennikov was named Commander-in-chief of Ground Forces and Deputy Minister of Defence. In 1991, during the August coup attempt he joined forces opposing Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. After the coup's failure General Varennikov was arrested, tried, and prosecuted together with other coup plotters. He was acquitted by the Supreme Court of Russia in 1994, as the court concluded he had merely followed orders and had acted \\"only in an interest of preserving and strengthening his country\\". He was the only member of the group of accused plotters who refused to accept an amnesty. Political career Varennikov with Vladimir Putin, 11 April 2002 In 1995 Varennikov, as a member of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, was elected deputy of the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament. In the Duma Varennikov presided over the Committee on Veterans' Affairs. In 2003 he joined the Rodina bloc as one of its leaders. Other activities In February 2008, Valentin Varennikov was officially accepted as fellow of the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences (Armenian branch) and member of the International Academy Ararat. He was the president and founder of the International League for Human Dignity and Security, an international NGO present in more than 40 countries.http://www.dignity.ru/en/about/ Stalin's champion Varennikov was one of Russia's most outspoken defenders of Joseph Stalin. During 2008, Varennikov presented the case for Stalin as Russia's greatest historical figure on the Name of Russia television project. Stalin won third place. According to Varennikov: \\"We became a great country because we were led by Stalin.\\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/dec/29/stalin-name-of-russia Awards and honors Varennikov was a holder of the Hero of the Soviet Union title and is a titular Knight of the Order of Glory, as well as having received numerous other Soviet, Russian and foreign medals and decorations. He held the honorary rank of retired field marshal. Personal life He had two sons and lived in Moscow, where he died on May 6, 2009, aged 85.

History The Priory was founded between 1072 and 1076 by L√ºtold of R√ºmligen. He granted the property and estates to Cluny Abbey making it the first Cluniac house in the German-speaking world. Under Cuno of Siegburg and Ulrich of Zell the first cells were built. Construction of the Romanesque church lasted from about 1100 to about 1185, of which there still remain the north transept and parts of the crossing tower. The Priory was dependent on Cluny Abbey and normally had a prior and two to four monks from Cluny. In 1148, it had two priories that were dependent on R√ºeggisberg, in R√∂thenbach im Emmental and Alterswil. At its peak the priory controlled estates throughout what is now the Canton of Bern, including Guggisberg, Alterswil, Plaffeien and Schwarzenburg as well as scattered farm houses and vineyards on the shores of Lake Biel. The priory was one of the most important monastic houses of Switzerland during the Middle Ages, but in the late medieval period decline set in, and in 1484 it was incorporated into the newly built college of the Augustinian Canons of Bern Minster. By 1532, when much of the town was destroyed in a fire, the Priory was abandoned.R√ºeggisberg Parish Website accessed 30 October 2012 The church was shut down in 1541 during the Reformation. The monastic buildings thereafter served as a source of building stone and partly as a barn. Between 1938 and 1947 on an archaeological dig the old foundations were again laid bare, as may be seen in the little museum next to the rectory. Current condition The ruins are generally open to the public, though they may be reserved for picnics or other gatherings. Each November an advent market is held in the ruins and over the years a variety of open air plays and concerts have been held here.R√ºeggisberg official website accessed 30 October 2012 Between Easter and September, church services are held monthly in the ruins.

It is part of the much larger Sistema Central of mountain ranges. Its highest point is Pico Almanzor, at 2,592 metres and it has been declared a natural park by the Autonomous Community of Castile and Le√≥n. The Sierra de Gredos is one of the most extensive mountain ranges of the Central System; it comprises five river valleys: the Alto Tormes, the Alto Alberche, the Ti√©tar Oriental, the Ti√©tar Occidental y la Vera, and the Valle del Ambroz. The first known inhabitants were the Vettones, a pre-Roman Celtic people. The central part of the range encomprises the Sierra de Gredos Regional Park. Geology The Sierra de Gredos comprises mainly granite, which is a common type of intrusive, felsic, igneous rock which is granular and phaneritic in texture. This rock consists mainly of quartz, mica, and feldspar. In some Gredos rocks the feldspar crystals are especially large, attaining a size of several centimeters in some cases. There is also some granodiorite and outcrops of metamorphic rocks. During a large part of the Paleozoic Era, from 600 to 350 million years ago, the whole area was covered by the Tethys Ocean where horizontal layers or strata of sediments accumulated due to the process of erosion in the unflooded regions. These sediments were fractured and folded due to the actions of the Variscan Orogeny and extensive areas emerged from the sea. At the end of the Paleozoic molten magma rose up which turned into granite as it cooled. Erosion continued for a long time until between 40 and 2 million years ago, when another convulsion, known as the Alpine Orogeny, created the mountains that today comprise the Central System. The tectonic style of the Sierra de Gredos is the so-called Germanic style, i.e. with large upraised fault blocks, known as horst, bounded by graben. The Sierra de Gredos is divided into three sectors: the Eastern sector up to the Puerto del Pico fault, the Central sector up to the Puerto de Tornavacas fault, and the Western sector which is the Sierra de B√©jar. Eastern section Rises in the south near the North Tietar fault. The northern limit of the horst is structured by a system of faults that run to the north-east, such as the Burguillo fault, and also in an east-west direction, like the Navaluenga fault, along which the Alberche river runs. The highest peaks of this sector are the following: * Alto del Mirlo 1.770 m (Casillas) * La Escusa 1.960 m * Gamonosa 1.993 m (Casavieja) * Lanchamala 1.999 m (Piedralaves) * El Torozo 2.025 m * Risco de Miravalles 2.010 m (Gavilanes) * Risco del Artu√±ero 2.011 m * Cabezo de Gavilanes 2.190 m (Gavilanes) Oropesa (Toledo). The North face of Circo de Gredos, seen from Morezon Lakes * Laguna Grande de Gredos * Las Cinco Lagunas * Laguna del Barco * Laguna de los Caballeros * Laguna de la Nava * Lagunas del Trampal * Laguna del Duque Fauna The main species to be found in the Sierra de Gredos are the following: The Spanish ibex (Capra pyrenaica). Sierra de Gredos * The Iberian ibex (Capra pyrenaica) * The roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) * The red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa) * The golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) * The Spanish imperial eagle (Aquila adalberti) * The European honey buzzard (Pernis apivorus) * The cinereous vulture (Aegypius monachus) * The griffon vulture (Gyps fulvus) Endemic species * The common toad of Gredos (Bufo bufo gredosicola) * The fire salamander of Almanzor (Salamandra salamandra almanzoris) * The European snow vole of Avila (Microtus nivalis abulensis) * The western Spanish ibex (Capra pyrenaica victoriae) * The lagartija carpetana (Iberolacerta cyreni), a species of lizard Flora The variety of plant life in the Sierra de Gredos is closely related to the altitude at which it is found. In ascending order, the following species of trees can be found: holm oak (or holly oak), chestnut, alder, rowan (or mountain ash), birch, aspen, willow, Pyrenean oak, replaced in some areas by pine. At higher altitudes there are mostly bushes of the genus Cytisus (brooms), juniper and several species of camomile.

Background The Royals won 92 games that year and won the Western Division title by five games over the Texas Rangers. The Yankees overcame a midseason deficit of 14 games and went on to win a one-game playoff against the Boston Red Sox to win the Eastern crown and finish with 100 wins. Unlike the prior two ALCS which went five games, this one only took the Yankees four games to wrap up, and the Yankees went on to represent the American League in the 1978 World Series. Notable performers in this series included Reggie Jackson, who hit two home runs, and Chris Chambliss, who had six base hits in 15 at bats. George Brett and Amos Otis were the hitting stars for the Royals. Summary New York Yankees vs. Kansas City Royals Game summaries Game 1 Prior to the start of this game, both teams had to deal with bad news. Ron Guidry, he of the incredible 25‚Äì3 Cy Young Award-winning season, would be unavailable to start until Game 4, if played, at least. Guidry pitched the AL East division tie-breaker game against the Boston Red Sox and was starting to have arm trouble. Also, second baseman Willie Randolph would miss the entire postseason with a hamstring injury and be replaced by a platoon of Fred Stanley and Brian Doyle. For the Royals, star George Brett was suffering from a bout of hemorrhoids. Without Guidry, the Yankees went with young Jim Beattie. Beattie pitched five shutout innings and Ken Clay went the rest of the way. The Royals would manage just two hits and one run off the two young pitchers. Meanwhile, the Yankee bats knocked Dennis Leonard and Steve Mingori around for 13 hits and four runs, Doyle chipping in an RBI single. Reggie Jackson put an exclamation point on the win with a three-run homer in the eighth off Al Hrabosky. Game 2 Royals' starter Larry Gura pitched six shutout innings and won with relief help from Marty Pattin and Al Hrabosky. The Royals' hitting stars were Darrell Porter, Frank White, and Fred Patek with two RBIs each, Patek's on a home run. Game 3 Yankee starter Catfish Hunter pitched a fine game, going six innings, except for one thing: three consecutive home runs by George Brett. Still, Hunter had a 4‚Äì3 lead after six thanks to a homer, RBI single, and sacrifice fly by Reggie Jackson. Jackson also scored a run in the fourth when Fred Patek overthrew Darrell Porter at home plate as Jackson was attempting to score on a hit by Lou Piniella. The Royals, however, got to Goose Gossage in the top of the eighth. Amos Otis doubled to right and Porter singled him in to tie it. After a Clint Hurdle single, Porter scored the go-ahead run on a groundout by Al Cowens. But, the Yanks would not be denied. After a one-out single by Roy White, Royals manager Whitey Herzog replaced his starter, left-hander Paul Splittorff, with right- hander Doug Bird to face Thurman Munson. Munson then greeted Bird with a 460-foot, game-winning, two-run blast into the Yankee bullpen in deep left- center field. Gossage retired the Royals in the ninth and got the win. The other irony of this game, besides Brett's three homers in a losing effort, was that Reggie Jackson was so productive against Paul Splittorff after former manager Billy Martin's claims that Jackson couldn't hit Splittorff during the 1977 American League Championship Series the year prior. Brett was the second player to hit three home runs in a League Championship Series game. Bob Robertson was the first, doing so in Game 2 of the 1971 NLCS. Game 4 Yankee manager Bob Lemon decided to use the sore-armed Ron Guidry to close out the series at Yankee Stadium. Guidry turned in an effective performance, going eight innings and giving up one run on seven hits and striking out seven. It didn't start out that way, though. George Brett led the game off with a triple off Guidry and Hal McRae immediately followed by driving in Brett with a single. But, the Royals would come up zeros the rest of the way. Meanwhile, Graig Nettles tied it with a homer in the second inning, and Roy White hit the deciding homer in the fifth off Dennis Leonard. Guidry left in the ninth after giving up a leadoff double to Amos Otis and Goose Gossage set down the next three Royal batters to close out the series and win their third straight AL Pennant.

Carboniferous/Jurassic unconformity. Carboniferous Limestone is a collective term for the succession of limestones occurring widely throughout Great Britain and Ireland that were deposited during the Dinantian Epoch of the Carboniferous Period. These rocks formed between 363 and 325 million years ago. Within England and Wales, the entire limestone succession, which includes subordinate mudstones and some thin sandstones, is known as the Carboniferous Limestone Supergroup. Depositional basins Carboniferous Limestone exposed at Tedbury Camp, Somerset, England. Within Great Britain the suite of rocks known traditionally as the Carboniferous Limestone Series was deposited as marine sediments in three distinct ‚Äòprovinces‚Äô separated by contemporary landmasses. One of these landmasses was the Wales-London-Brabant Massif, an east-west aligned belt of land stretching through central Wales and the English Midlands to East Anglia and on into Belgium. The limestones deposited to its south form a distinct South Wales-Mendip province which extends from Pembrokeshire in the west through southern Carmarthenshire, Glamorgan and south Powys to Monmouthshire, Gloucestershire and north Somerset. These rocks continue eastwards at depth beneath Oxfordshire. The Carboniferous Limestone sequence of South Wales and the Bristol area is currently (2012) subdivided thus: * Pembroke Limestone Group (uppermost/youngest) **Oystermouth Formation **Oxwich Head Limestone Formation ***Penderyn Oolite Member ***Honeycombed Sandstone Member **Dowlais Limestone Formation **Abercriban Oolite Subgroup & Clydach Valley Subgroup *Avon Group **Cwmyniscoy Mudstone Formation **Castell Coch Limestone Formation (lowermost/oldest) The limestone found north of the Wales-London-Brabant Massif and south of the emergent Southern Uplands block is identified as a separate northern province. It is characterised by the presence of numerous ‚Äòblocks‚Äô and ‚Äòbasins‚Äô each with its own particular depositional style. To the north of the Southern Uplands are the limestones of the Scottish Midland Valley stretching from Ayrshire and Arran in the west to Fife, Lothian and Berwickshire in the east. Though of Carboniferous age, the limestones of this Scottish province are not assigned to the Carboniferous Limestone Supergroup. The Carboniferous Limestone is widespread throughout Ireland. Geographical extent Cross-section of Carboniferous Limestone bored by Jurassic organisms; borings include Gastrochaenolites (some with boring bivalves in place) and Trypanites; Mendip Hills, England; scale bar = 1 cm. The Carboniferous Limestone is a significant landscape-forming rock unit in each of the depositional provinces of Great Britain within which it is found. South Wales and Bristol area Within Pembrokeshire the Carboniferous Limestone forms the spectacular coastal cliffs at St Govan‚Äôs Head along from which are features such as Huntsman's Leap and the Green Bridge of Wales, a natural arch. It forms prominent headlands such as those of Stackpole Head and Lydstep Point and the cliffs at Tenby.British Geological Survey 1:50,000 scale map series sheet E244/5 Pembroke & Linney Head A narrow, intensely quarried outcrop runs inland from Carmarthen Bay through Carmarthenshire from Kidwelly, entering the Brecon Beacons National Park at Llandyfan and extending westwards through the Black Mountain to Cribarth above the upper Swansea Valley.

Characteristics  Carboniferous Limestone is a hard sedimentary rock made largely of calcium carbonate. It is generally light-grey in colour. It was formed in warm, shallow tropical seas teeming with life. The rock is made up of the shells and hard parts of millions of sea creatures, some up to 30 cm in length, encased in carbonate mud. Fossil corals, brachiopods and crinoids are frequently in evidence as components of Carboniferous Limestone; indeed the rock is full of fossils. Carboniferous Limestone has horizontal layers (beds) with bedding planes, and vertical joints. These joints are weaknesses in the rock, which are exploited by agents of both denudation and weathering. They also lead to an important characteristic of Carboniferous Limestone ‚Äì its permeability. Water seeps through the joints in the limestone. This creates a landscape geologists call karst, which lacks surface drainage but which has all manner of characteristic surface and subsurface features. The Carboniferous Limestone has been folded and faulted by massive Earth movements which can be seen by the fact that the rocks are now above sea-level and no longer horizontal.  Surface features  Carboniferous coral, Ingleton, North Yorkshire Carboniferous/Jurassic unconformity surface at Tedbury Camp. The 'classic limestone walk' is a circular 10 km route from the field centre on the north side of Malham Tarn to the village of Malham, UK via Watlowes Valley and back again via Gordale Scar. Surface depressions, typically funnel-shaped and variously known as shakeholes, sinkholes, solution hollows and dolines are very common in the Yorkshire Dales and Brecon Beacons. Typically from 1‚Äì20 m deep and 1‚Äì60 m across, they form as a result of the subsurface collapse of limestone or through the more gradual dropping of surface material into caves. Streams flowing from higher impermeable slopes sink into the ground when they reach permeable limestone. During dry spells all water sinks very quickly on reaching the limestone, through sinkholes. In wetter conditions water flows a greater distance across the limestone as underground channels and chambers fill up. Large sinkholes are called 'swallowholes' or 'potholes'. Gaping Gill, Alum Pot and the Buttertubs are well-known examples. Dry valleys are valleys without streams. Watlowes Valley is an excellent example. It was formed originally by a subglacial meltwater stream which existed during the last major Ice Age. After the ice retreated, the valley was further developed by a meltwater stream flowing across the limestone while it was frozen solid. Watlowes Valley is a particularly good example of a dry valley because it has a textbook profile - the south-facing side is less steep than the north-facing side. This results from the weathering and mass movement processes that have operated in the post-glacial period. A limestone pavement is an area of almost bare, flat rock and is arguably the most fascinating feature of any area of carboniferous limestone. They develop after the rock has been exposed by the scouring action of an ice sheet or glacier. Existing joints are subsequently exploited by the action of chemical weathering carbonation to form deep grykes and rounded blocks called clints. Grykes have a habitat of their own, which encourages the growth of shade-loving ferns such as hart's tongue and dog's mercury. During the last Ice Age, a stream is thought to have poured over Malham Cove - the most spectacular feature in the Yorkshire Dales. At the end of the Ice Age the limestone, which had been frozen solid, once again became permeable, allowing the water to disappear through its joints. Now Malham Cove is a high cliff (83 m high) ‚Äì it is completely dry, and a great attraction to rock climbers. A gorge is a steep-sided valley, often formed in a limestone area as the result of the collapse of a roof above a cave system. Gordale Scar is an excellent example.  Subsurface features  Caves are common subsurface features in limestone landscapes. In the Yorkshire Dales, there are numerous caves, three of which ‚Äì Ingleborough Cave, White Scar Caves and Stump Cross Caverns ‚Äì are now show caves for the public. In Ireland there is a large number of show caves open to visitors - Crag Cave, Ailwee Cave and Marble Arch Caves. The stalagmite and stalactite are the two main subsurface features in a Carboniferous Limestone area. These are formed when rainwater - a weak carbonic acid capable of dissolving limestone - percolates through it via the grykes and joints underground. This means the limestone is pervious. As this happens the limestone is dissolved and removed in solution. Caverns are often found below the surface in the limestone and as the lime-rich water finds its way underground it begins to drip from the roof of the cavern. It is cold underground so there is little evaporation but some does take place leaving a trace of limestone on the roof. Over thousands of years a stalactite forms from the ceiling as the water continues to drip. When the water drips on to the floor of the cavern some evaporation occurs here also leaving a trace of limestone. Again over thousands of years a stalagmite is formed. A stone pillar is formed when a stalagmite and stalactite meet.  Economics  Because it is brittle, the use of Carboniferous Limestone for building stone tends to be limited to those areas where it is the most abundantly available rock. However it is extensively quarried for other purposes: * It is crushed for roadstone and aggregate wherever it outcrops, particularly in the Mendips and north Wales. * It is burned for lime in many places. In certain places (e.g. Tunstead in the Peak District, and Horton in Ribblesdale in the Pennines), it is sufficiently pure for production of chemical-grade lime. * It is used in cement manufacture at plants in England (4), Wales (2), Scotland (1) and Ireland (4). * In ground form, it is used for power industry flue-gas desulphurisation. * In many places it is metalliferous, and has yielded lead (in the Peak District and Weardale), and copper (in North Wales, where important Bronze Age mines are to be found). * It was important in the early Industrial Revolution when, following the inventions of Abraham Darby, it was used in combination with nearby coal and ironstone from the Coal Measures in the iron industry.

It served as the residence of the bishops and archbishops of Glasgow Cathedral until the Reformation, when the last Catholic archbishop, James Beaton, fled to France in about 1560. The castle was completely destroyed in the late 18th century, to make way for the Glasgow Royal Infirmary. The origins of the castle are unclear, but the first development was probably in the 12th century. It was recorded as a royal fortress in the mid 13th century.Mason, p.140 It had become an episcopal residence by the time of the Wars of Scottish Independence, when William Wallace recaptured the castle from the English in 1296. In 1301 the castle was garrisoned again by Edward I. In the 15th century a 5-storey keep was built by Bishop Cameron, this was later extended with additional fortifications and buildings, constructed by later bishops. Archbishop Beaton added a large corner tower, and Archbishop Dunbar built a round-towered gatehouse in 1544. The central keep served as the residence of the bishop, and was called the Bishop's Palace. The castle played a role in the many political battles during the 16th century, including the protracted struggle between supporters of Mary, Queen of Scots, and her enemies. It changed hands six times between 1513 and 1570, and was occupied by French troops at one point. In 1544 it was defended against Regent Arran and in 1560 defended for Arran. The castle fell into disrepair during the 17th century, despite an attempt at repair by Archbishop Ross in the 1680s, and was gradually dismantled for its stone. It was finally demolished completely in 1789, to make way for the construction of the Glasgow Royal Infirmary. Foundations of the castle were discovered during excavations for the St Mungo Museum of Religious Life and Art in the 1980s. The museum building was designed by architect Iain Begg to reflect the style of the Bishop's Castle. A stone from the castle, with a modern plaque, is located in Cathedral Square, marking the location of the keep.

Together with Yosa Buson, he perfected the bunjinga (or nanga) genre. The majority of his works reflected his passion for classical Chinese culture and painting techniques, though he also incorporated revolutionary and modern techniques into his otherwise very traditional paintings. As a bunjin (Êñá‰∫∫, literati, man of letters), Ike was close to many of the prominent social and artistic circles in Kyoto, and in other parts of the country, throughout his lifetime. Life Ike no Taiga was born into a poor and socially humble family; his father was a farmer on the outskirts of Kyoto. The family moved into Kyoto proper some years before Taiga's birth, possibly to escape famine. His father found work at the silver mint, which granted his family some small degree of wealth, but he died when Taiga was three years of age. Taiga's widowed mother somehow managed to afford to provide him with good teachers, in all the classical Japanese and Chinese disciplines. At age six, he began receiving instruction in calligraphy and religious matters at the Manpuku-ji Zen temple. He would continue to foster strong connections with this temple for the remainder of his life. By age fourteen, Taiga was a professional artist and distinguished calligrapher. He ran a small fan-painting shop in Kyoto, and engraved artists' and collectors' seals as well. It was an encounter with Yanagisawa Kien, a major social and artistic figure of the time, that initiated Taiga's introduction to the world of the bunjin. Chinese painter Yi Fujiu (J: I Fuky≈´ or Yi Hai, 1698-1740?), whose main activity was selling horses in Nagasaki, taught Chinese literati painting that soon became the main model for Ike no Taiga, as reported in the ' (A Painting Manual of Landscapes by Yi Fujiu and Ike no Taiga) published in 1803.Marco, Meccarelli. 2015. \\"Chinese Painters in Nagasaki: Style and Artistic Contaminatio during the Tokugawa Period (1603-1868)\\" Ming Qing Studies 2015, Pages 175-236. Taiga studied painting and calligraphy under Kien beginning in 1738. He became quite fond of the eccentric, but ancient, practice of painting with fingertips and fingernails, and became close friends with two other bunjin students, Kan Tenju and K≈ç Fuy≈ç. By the age of twenty (1743), Taiga fully considered himself a member of the literati, and took the name \\"Ike,\\" shortened from his family name \\"Ikeno\\" (Ê±†Èáé), in emulation of the Chinese tendency for single-character names. Taiga returned to Kyoto and to his fan shop in the early 1740s. Though the bunjin lifestyle dictated an avoidance of commercialism, Taiga had no other source of income and so he continued to sell his works and various artistic services, much like his contemporary and friend Yosa Buson. He married an artist and tea house proprietor in 1746, who went by the art-name (g≈ç) Gyokuran. The pair quickly became well-renowned in the social circles and artistic community of Kyoto. Two years into his marriage, Taiga set off on a series of journeys, another major element of the bunjin lifestyle. He sought to commune with nature, to glean inspiration for his art, and most of all, to simply become a more cultured and experienced individual. After travels through Kanazawa, Nikk≈ç, and Mount Fuji, Taiga stayed for a time in Edo. There, he produced paintings and calligraphic pieces, and also learned about Dutch art from a number of Rangaku (Dutch learning) scholars, including Noro Genj≈ç. Taiga would continue to travel and to climb mountains for much of the rest of his life, often accompanied by bunjin colleagues. For a time, he took on the g≈ç of Sangaku D≈çja (‰∏âÂ≤≥ÈÅìËÄÖ, \\"Pilgrim of the Three Peaks\\"). He would often collaborate with his colleagues on joint works of art during this trips; the J≈´ben j≈´gi-j≈ç (Album of Ten Conveniences and Ten Pleasures) was created in 1771, as the result of one of these collaborations. The J≈´ben j≈´gi-j≈ç, illustrated by Taiga and Yosa Buson, and containing text by Chinese writer Li Yu (1611-c.1680), acclaims and celebrates a life of simple pleasures and communing with nature. The book is widely regarded today as providing an exemplary insight into the bunjin philosophy. Another artist who would have a dramatic influence on Taiga a little later in life, after his return to Kyoto, was Hakuin Ekaku, who stayed briefly at Taiga's home in 1752. Though they met only briefly, Taiga began to use elements of Hakuin's personal style, and he soon afterwards sought out many of Hakuin's disciples, working with them and inscribing one another's works. Some of Taiga's works have been classified National Treasures by the Japanese government.  References  Sources *Rosenfield, John M. (1999).

For a while, it was the western extremity of the Callander and Oban Railway, until the line finally reached its ultimate destination, Oban, on 1 July 1880. The station was laid out with two platforms, one on either side of a passing loop. It once boasted a small engine shed and a turntable on the south side. The station building was destroyed by fire on 16 November 1898.Thomas (1990), page 194 The red sandstone building and signal box are a Category C listed building as being a 'well detailed example of a small through station in the area'.  Signalling  Dalmally signal box, which replaced the original box on 17 June 1896, was located on the Up platform. It contained 24 levers. Dalmally lost all its semaphore signals on 9 February 1986, in preparation for Radio Electronic Token Block (RETB) signalling. RETB was commissioned on 27 March 1988, resulting in the closure of Dalmally signal box, amongst others.

Biography He is credited with being the architect who designed and built Istanbul's first selatin mosque, the Fatih Mosque and its complex, in 1471 for Mehmed II, over the ruins of the Church of the Holy Apostles, which was razed to the ground by the Ottomans in order for the Fatih Mosque to be built.Van Millingen, Alexander (1912). Byzantine Churches of Constantinople. London: MacMillan & Co., p. 276. His nephew, also an architect, built the Bayezid II Mosque. Tradition holds that Sultan Mehmed II endowed the Greek Orthodox Church of St. Mary of the Mongols, the only church in Istanbul still standing that was never converted into a mosque, to the mother of Christodoulos (Sinan's Greek name) in acknowledgment of his work. This grant was confirmed by Bayazid II, in recognition of the services of the nephew of Christodoulos, who built the mosque bearing that sultan's name. Legend has it that because the architect failed to make the dome of the mosque bigger and higher than the Byzantine Hagia Sophia cathedral, the disappointed and angered Mehmed II amputated the hand of the architect. Sinan complained to the city judge (kadhi), who ruled what the sultan did was unjust and judged that the architect could amputate the sultan's hand in return. Seeing the sultan submit to the judge's order, the Greek architect was amazed with Muslim justice, pardoned the sultan, and converted to Islam. The sultan rewarded Sinan by giving him the ownership of a whole street, a gift recognized by Ahmed III three centuries later.Rabah Saoud (July 2004).\\"Muslim Architecture under Ottoman Patronage (1326‚Äì1924)\\". Foundation for Science Technology and Civilisation. Architectural Influence Atik Sinan designed and oversaw the construction of ‚Äúone of the most important historical monuments in Istanbul‚Äù ‚Äì the Fatih Mosque and its K√ºlliye, meaning complex. In addition to being the first large selatin mosque in the city, it was also the first large building in the Ottoman imperial architectural tradition constructed in the recently captured Constantinople. Atik Sinan named the structure for the man who commissioned his work ‚Äì Mehmed the Conqueror, as the word Conqueror translates to ‚ÄúFatih‚Äù in Turkish. Atik Sinan began construction for the complex in 1463 and completed the project in 1471. Its location ‚Äì on the site of the recently destroyed Byzantine Church of the Holy Apostles, and its status as the first major mosque construction in the city rendered it ‚Äúan effective center for the radiation of Ottoman urbanization.‚Äù Architecturally, Atik Sinan drew inspiration from other Turkoman mosques as well as the Hagia Sophia. The mosque had a more simple design than its grand Byzantine inspiration, as it featured only one central dome supported by a single semi-dome above the qibla. The earthquake on 22 May 1766 destroyed the original mosque, though the reconstruction, overseen by Sultan Mustafa II, has been in place since 1771. The Fatih Mosque‚Äôs K√ºlliye is also of great architectural significance. Atik Sinan constructed a massive complex spreading from the east and west sides of the mosques. The complex included a library, a soup kitchen, a hospital, a hospice, a library, no less than eight madrasas, and the eventual tombs of both Mehmed II and his wife. The medical complexes were largely staffed by Jewish doctors, demonstrating the religious syncretism of the city and the empire as a whole. The madrasas Atik Sinan constructed marked an important shift in education in the Ottoman Empire, as they served as a new center for religious and judicial training in the capital as opposed to the more distant training centers in Cairo. The tombs were also significant, as they legitimized Mehmed II‚Äôs claim to the title of ‚ÄúKayser-i Rum (Caesar of Rome)‚Äù and further ‚ÄúOttomanized the city.‚Äù The Fatih Mosque‚Äôs K√ºlliye never fully succumbed to the earthquake damage that destroyed the mosque itself, and thus remains largely as Atik Sinan built it - ‚Äúpreserved in its original form.‚Äù References Category:1471 deaths Category:Converts to Islam from Eastern Orthodoxy Category:Former Greek Orthodox Christians Category:Architects of the Ottoman Empire Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Mehmed the Conqueror Category:15th-century Greek people ","title":"Atik Sinan"},{"id":"4242382","text":"Cergy‚ÄìSaint-Christophe station Cergy‚ÄìSaint-Christophe is a railway station in the city of Cergy, France.

Boy Scouts of America was a case involving the City of San Diego's relationship with the Boy Scouts of America. Plaintiffs Lori and Lynn Barnes-Wallace, a lesbian couple, joined Michael and Valerie Breen, an agnostic couple, in suing the City of San Diego and the Boy Scouts of America. Both couples are the parents of Scout-aged sons, but had never tried to use the facilities. The Boy Scouts of America has policies forbidding atheists, agnostics, and formerly had policies forbidding gays, from participating in the organization. Since 1957, the City of San Diego has leased part of the city's Balboa Park to the Boy Scouts of America for the price of $1 per year. In 2000, the Breens and the Barnes-Wallaces, aided by the American Civil Liberties Union, sued the city, alleging that the lease was unconstitutional. In 2003, the District Court agreed and ruled in favor of Barnes-Wallace. The case was appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals who reversed the decision in 2012 in favor of the Boy Scouts. \\"There is no evidence the city's purpose in leasing the subject properties to the Boy Scouts was to advance religion, and there is abundant evidence that its purpose was to provide facilities and services for youth activities,\\" wrote Judge William C. Canby Jr. . In 2013, the plaintiffs decided not to appeal the ruling in favor of the Boy Scouts, thus ending the suit. Background information The City of San Diego has leased property to more than 100 nonprofit organizations for little or no cash rent to provide for the \\"cultural, educational, and recreational enrichment of the citizens of the City.\\" Many of those leases involve parkland from which the City benefits by saving on maintenance costs. A number of other leases involve property in residential and commercial zones. The lessees under the San Diego policy are diverse, ranging from the YMCA and the Jewish Community Center to the Vietnamese Federation of San Diego and the Black Police Officers Association. A number of churches are among the lessees. The issue in this case involves two of these leases, between the City and the Boy Scouts for dedicated parkland in Balboa Park and Mission Bay Park (which includes Fiesta Island). The Boy Scouts of America is a nonprofit charitable organization that received a congressional charter in 1916 \\"to promote, through organization, and cooperation with other agencies, the ability of boys to do things for themselves and others, to train them in scoutcraft, and to teach them patriotism, courage, self-reliance, and kindred virtues.\\" All youth members and adult leaders must subscribe to the Scout Oath and Law. Together, these entail acknowledging a duty to God, and recognizing reverence as a virtue. The bylaws of the BSA includes the Declaration of Religious Principle, which is printed in BSA publications such as the youth and adult applications and the various leader handbooks. The original lease for Camp Balboa was entered into in 1957 for a period of 50 years. This lease enabled the Boy Scouts to build a recreational facility and administrative offices for the Desert Pacific Council (now San Diego-Imperial Council ) of the Boy Scouts. The Boy Scouts also built nine campsites, made extensive improvements to the property, and maintains all of the facilities of Camp Balboa. These facilities are available, for a nominal usage fee, to all community groups and individuals on a first-come, first-served reservation basis. In 1987, the City entered into a 25-year lease with the Boy Scouts for a half acre parcel of public parkland located on Fiesta Island in Mission Bay Park. The Fiesta Island Facility Committee, which was composed of more than 40 organizations serving youth in the San Diego area, had identified the Boy Scouts as the entity best able to provide the funding for construction and maintenance of a community aquatic park, and to run its operations. In lieu of cash rent, the Boy Scouts committed to build the San Diego Youth Aquatic Center on Fiesta Island. The Aquatic Center that BSA built is used by a wide variety of other groups serving youth. The lease states that the Boy Scouts \\"can use no more than 75% of all available aquatic activities up to 7 days prior.\\" Both leases include nondiscrimination clauses prohibiting the Boy Scouts from discriminating in access to the properties against non-scouting individuals and organizations based on religion and sexual orientation. There have been no instances of a non-scouting organization or individual being discriminated against when requesting access to either facility. The Boy Scouts of America has policies forbidding atheists and agnostics from participating in the organization. Until 2013 and 2015, it banned openly gay youth and leaders respectively. In December 2001, prior to the lease's expiration date, the city renewed the lease for an additional 25 years, with an option to renew for an additional 15-year term. The terms of the renewal lease require the Boy Scouts to spend at least $1.7 million over the next seven years on improvements, remodeling, and new construction. District Court In 2000, the Plaintiffs sued the city, aided by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). They alleged that the lease was unconstitutional. The case was filed in the United States District Court, Southern District of California.

After leaving grammar school he worked as an office boy, and then went into the real estate business, until the cataclysmic 1906 San Francisco earthquake wiped out his fortune. He then moved to New York City in search of other opportunities, soon realizing that the theatrical world was lucrative, and he worked busily in New York as a musical conductor, composer, and arranger. He also produced Broadway shows such as Kindling in 1911-12 and The Bridal Path in 1913. He was married to Kindling star Margaret Illington from 1910 until her death in 1934; her portrait by Adolfo M√ºller-Ury had been painted in 1906 for her first husband, theatre manager Daniel Frohman. He became managing director of New York's Capitol Theatre, which he ran with military efficiency. He insisted on being addressed as \\"Major Bowes,\\" a nickname that sprang from his earlier military rank, though historians are divided on whether he was an active-duty officer in World War I or held the rank as a member of the Officer Reserve Corps. Bowes brought his best-known creation to New York radio station WHN in 1934. He had actually hosted scattered amateur nights on smaller stations while manager of the Capitol. Within a year of its WHN premiere, The Original Amateur Hour‚Äîits original name, according to historian Gerald Nachman, was Major Bowes and His Capitol Family‚Äîbegan earning its creator and host as much as $1 million a year, according to Variety. The rapid popularity of The Original Amateur Hour made him better known than most of the talent he featured. Some of his discoveries became stars, including opera stars Lily Pons, Robert Merrill, and Beverly Sills; comedian Jack Carter; pop singer Teresa Brewer; and Frank Sinatra, fronting a quartet known as the Hoboken Four when they appeared on the show in 1935. The show consistently ranked among radio's top ten programs throughout its run. Bowes' familiar catchphrase \\"Round and round she goes, and where she stops nobody knows,\\" was spoken in the familiar avuncular tones for which he was renowned, whenever it was time to spin the \\"wheel of fortune,\\" the device by which some contestants were called to perform. In the early days of the show, whenever a performer was simply too terrible to continue, Bowes would stop the act by striking a gong (a device that would be revived in the 1970s by Chuck Barris's infamous The Gong Show). Bowes heard from thousands of listeners who objected to his terminating these acts prematurely, so he abandoned the gong in 1936. Nachman recorded that Bowes, \\"a businesslike fellow with a mirthless chuckle who, unlike most emcees, had a gift for nongab,\\" went out of his way to make contestants feel at ease, often taking them to dinner before their appearances. Nachman credits Bowes for featuring more black entertainers than many network shows of the time. Death and legacy The grave of Major Edward Bowes and wife Margaret Illington in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery Major Bowes died on the eve of his 72nd birthday at his home in the New Jersey suburb of Rumson, New Jersey.\\"Major Bowes Dies at Home in New Jersey\\", Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, June 14, 1946, p. 1 The following week, his talent coordinator Ted Mack took over hosting duties. Nineteen months after Bowes' death, on January 18, 1948, the program, with Ted Mack as host, debuted on the DuMont Television Network. As a measure of the affection attached to Bowes' name, the show continued to be called Major Bowes' Original Amateur Hour until the 1950-51 season, when it became simply Original Amateur Hour, and in 1955 became Ted Mack and the Original Amateur Hour. Mack continued to host the show throughout the remainder of its run, during which it ran on all four major networks, until 1970. The radio version, also with Mack, ran until 1952. Bowes was referred to in Cab Calloway's \\"I Love to Singa\\" from the movie The Singing Kid (1936), and in the Dorothy Fields lyrics for \\"Never Gonna Dance,\\" from the Astaire-Rogers film Swing Time (1936). He is also referenced in the song I'm Still Here from Sondheim's 1971 musical Follies. Bowes was a benefactor of the Catholic Church. Our Lady of Victory Church in Lower Manhattan is built on land donated by Bowes. Also, the auditorium at Archbishop Stepinac High School in White Plains is named in his honor. He donated some of the rare books at St. Joseph's Seminary, Yonkers. In 1939, Major Bowes donated his multi-acre Ossining estate, known as \\"Laurel Hill,\\" to the Lutheran Church, where it is still being enjoyed as an ecumenical retreat center. Run by a board of Lutheran lay persons and clergy, it is known as Major Edward Bowes Memorial Retreat, and operates year-round for students, church, and community groups in the greater New York metro area.http://www.majorbowesmemorialretreat.org Quote * \\"All men are at heart critics.

The station was laid out with two platforms, one on either side of a crossing loop. There are two sidings on the south side of the station. On 11 January 1987, the crossing loop was altered to right-hand running. The original Down platform has thus become the Up platform, and vice versa. The change was made in order to simplify shunting at this station, by removing the need to hand-pump the train-operated loop points to access the sidings.  Signalling  From the time of its opening in 1880, the single line between Dalmally and Oban was worked by the electric token system, this being the first ever application of that system in everyday service. Taynuilt signal box, which replaced the original box on 24 March 1921, was located at the west end of the station, on the south side of the line. It had 16 levers. Taynuilt lost all its semaphore signals on 16 February 1986, in preparation for Radio Electronic Token Block (RETB) signalling. RETB was commissioned between Crianlarich and Taynuilt on 27 March 1988. Taynuilt signal box did not close until 24 April of that year, when the RETB spread west to Oban. The redundant signal box was later relocated to the opposite end of the station, where it is currently in a semi-derelict state. The Train Protection & Warning System was installed in 2003.

This station is on the Oban branch of the West Highland Line, originally part of the Callander and Oban Railway.  Facilities  Station facilities are somewhat basic, consisting of a shelter and a telephone for obtaining train running information. Platform lighting is installed.  History  Connel Ferry station opened on 1 July 1880, when the final section of the Callander and Oban Railway, between Dalmally and Oban, came into use. The original layout at Connel Ferry comprised a crossing loop with a platform on each side, with some sidings on the north side. Considerable enlargement of the station took place in 1903, with the opening of the branch line to Ballachulish. The original Down platform became an island platform, with the Down Main line routed alongside the new south face, and the Up Main line (the original Down line) to its north. The former Up platform became the Branch Platform and a bay platform was constructed at its west end. A goods loop ran to the south of the Down Main line. A turntable was provided in the goods yard for turning the branch line locomotives. A short distance beyond the junction, the branch line spanned Loch Etive by means of Connel Bridge, a cantilever bridge with a span length that was at the time second only to the Forth Bridge. In 1940, additional sidings were laid in on the south side of the station for the wartime traffic, these being removed in 1948. Prior to closure of the Ballachulish branch 1966 both trains and vehicles crossed the bridge. The extensive track layout was reduced to just a single line routed via the former Branch Platform (the original Up platform). The island platform was taken out of use. The layout grew again in 1968 when an oil storage depot with two sidings was built on the site of the goods yard. A run-round loop was laid alongside the single line to the east of the station, connected at each end by points controlled from a ground frame. The disused island platform was demolished in 1985.  Signalling  Looking towards Crianlarich at Connel Ferry From the time of its opening in 1880, the single line between Dalmally and Oban was worked by the electric token system, this being the first ever application of that system in everyday service. The enlarged layout of 1903 was controlled from two large wooden signal boxes, the East box having 42 levers, and the West box 56. The latter controlled the branch line junction and a signal gantry located nearby spanned three tracks. The signal gantry was replaced on 22 January 1953. Both signal boxes closed on 8 January 1967 and all signals were removed. During the 1968 demolition of Connel Ferry West signal box, contractors burning the wooden remains set fire to the track formation. Despite efforts to put the fire out, it continued to burn for several days, causing the embankment to crumble and smoke to issue from fissures in the trackbed. This resulted in a 5 mph speed restriction being imposed and, at the time, caused concerns that the line may be forced to close. In 1988, the station became a Token Exchange Point in connection with the new Radio Electronic Token Block signalling system. The Train Protection & Warning System was installed in 2003. Services There are 7 departures in each direction Mondays to Saturdays(6 on Saturdays), eastbound to and westbound to . On weekdays only, an additional service in each direction between & Oban calls here in the late afternoon. On Sundays, there are three departures each way throughout the year, plus a fourth in the summer months only to Edinburgh Waverley which only runs from late June‚ÄìAugust.

He also served as Prime Minister of the Netherlands Antilles for a few months in 2003. Komproe was a member of the local party Frente Obrero Liberashon 30 di Mei (FOL), and was fifth on the ballot for the 5 May 2003 national elections. When party leader Anthony Godett was blocked from being appointed formateur (person responsible for forming the cabinet, see Elections in the Netherlands Antilles) because of a police investigation, Komproe was appointed instead. For the same reason, Komproe was named Prime Minister of the Netherlands Antilles from 22 July until 11 August 2003. After that, he was replaced by Mirna Louisa-Godett, and became Minister of Justice. As Minister of Justice, Komproe attempted to order the local authorities to cease investigating his brother Hedwig Komproe. Additionally, he tried to have Attorney General Dick Piar fired. When word finally got out that he had abused his position to help keep fellow party member Nelson Monte out of prison, the Netherlands Antillean parliament forced Komproe to step down, leading to the fall of the Godett Cabinet. After his resignation, a judicial investigation was started on Komproe's tenure as a minister. The investigation included what went on at an open-air brothel Campo Alegre. Komproe was alleged to have given out signed letters, basically to allow dozens of prostitutes from Colombia and the Dominican Republic to reside on Cura√ßao. He was said to have plans to process each prostitute's permit of residence personally, and to have ordered a special stamp just for this purpose. In July 2004, a judge determined that Komproe was not authorized to issue letters of that nature. Additionally, Komproe did favors for Giovanni van Ierland, the incarcerated owner of the brothel. In September 2004, Komproe was to be on the Cura√ßao Island Council for the FOL. However, he was arrested on 6 September 2004, and charged with corruption, fraud, and membership of a criminal organisation. On 24 September his imprisonment was delayed, because he had had a severe stomach operation a few days before. He never regained consciousness after his operation and died at age 61.

We have heard the talk of our great father; it is very kind, he says he loves his red children. Brothers! I have listened to many talks from our great father. When he first came over the wide waters, he was but a little man, and wore a red coat. Our chiefs met him on the banks of the river Savannah, and smoked with him the pipe of peace. His legs were cramped by sitting long in his big boat, and he begged for a little land to light his fire on. He said he had come over the wide waters to teach Indians new things, and to make them happy. He said he loved his red brothers, which is very kind. The Muscogees gave the white man land, and kindled him a fire, that he might warm himself; and when his enemies, the pale faces of the south, made war on him, their young men drew the tomahawk, and protected his head from the scalping knife.\\" \\"But when the white man had warmed himself before the Indian's fire, and filled himself with their hominy, he became very large. With a step he bestrode the mountains, and his feet covered the plains and the valleys. His hands grasped the eastern and western sea, and his head rested on the moon. Then he became our Great Father. He loved his red children, and he said, \\"Get a little further, lest I tread on thee.\\" With one foot he pushed the red man over the Oconee, and with the other he trampled down the graves of his fathers and the forests where he had so long hunted the deer. But our great father still loved his red children, and he soon made them another talk. He said, \\"Get a little further; you are too near me.\\" But there were some bad men among the Muscogees then, as there are now. They lingered around the graves of their ancestors, till they were crushed beneath the heavy tread of our great father. Their teeth pierced his feet, and made him angry. Yet, he continued to love his red children; and when he found them too slow in moving, he sent his great guns before him to sweep his path.\\" \\"Brothers!

Life Ragnar Nurkse was born in K√§ru village, Governorate of Livonia of the Russian Empire (now in T√ºri Parish, J√§rva County, Estonia), son of an Estonian father who worked himself up from lumberjack to estate manager, and an Estonian-Swedish mother. His parents emigrated to Canada in 1928. After a Russian-speaking primary school, Nurkse attended the elite Cathedral School of Tallinn, the most prestigious, German-language secondary school in the city, from where he graduated with higher honors in 1928. He continued his education at the Law School and the economics department of the University of Tartu from 1926 to 1928, and then in economics at the University of Edinburgh. He graduated with a first class degree in economics, under professor Sir Frederick Ogilvie, in 1932. He earned a Carnegie Fellowship to study at the University of Vienna from 1932 to 1934. Nurkse served in the Financial Section and Economic Intelligence Service of the League of Nations from 1934 to 1945. He was the financial analyst and was largely responsible for the annual Monetary Review. He was also involved with the publication of The Review of World Trade, World Economic Surveys, and the report of the Delegation on Economic Depressions entitled \\"The Transition from War to Peace Economy\\". In 1945, Nurkse accepted an appointment at Columbia University in New York City. He was a visiting lecturer at Columbia from 1945 to 1946, was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, from 1946 to 1947, and then returned to Columbia as an Associate Professor of Economics in 1947. In 1949, he was promoted to Full Professor of Economics, a position which he held almost until his death in 1959. Nurkse spent a sabbatical (1954‚Äì1955) at the Nuffield College of the University of Oxford, and in 1958‚Äì1959, another one studying economic development in the University of Geneva, and lecturing around the world. In 1958, Ragnar Nurkse accepted a Professorship of Economics and the Director of International Finance Section position at Princeton University.

For his 100th anniversary on 5 October 2007, the Estonian Postal Service commemorated Nurkse with an international letter stamp. A large stone monument with a plaque will also be unveiled across the house he was born in K√§ru. He was also honored earlier in 2007 by the inauguration of a Lecture Series by the Bank of Estonia and an international conference by Tallinn University of Technology's Technology Governance program. An economics professorship at Columbia is named in his honor. Work Nurkse is one of the founding fathers of Classical Development Economics. Together with Rosenstein-Rodan and Mandelbaum, he promoted a 'theory of the big push', emphasized the role of savings and capital formation in economic development, and argued that poor nations remained poor because of a 'vicious circle of poverty'. Among his major works are International Currency Experience: Lessons of the Interwar Period (1944), the foundation of the Bretton Woods Agreement, Conditions of International Monetary Equilibrium (1945), and Problems of Capital Formation in Underdeveloped Countries (1953).

Their territory included Montana, North Dakota, Alberta and Saskatchewan. He is known as a skilled negotiator with the American Fur Company at Fort Union, North Dakota; and for his participation and representation at the Fort Laramie Treaty Council of 1851‚Äîwhere he was a signatory of the treaty' He earned the name Mah-To-Wit-Ko (meaning \\"Crazy Bear\\") because he fought like a crazy bear. \\"Wit-Ko\\" is a Siouan word that has multiple translations: crazy, foolish, frightening and mad. Crazy Bear has been recorded by these names and also in French as Ours Fou (in various sketches and documents). He had three granddaughters; Iron Cradle (aka Sweet Grass), Turtle Door, Small Earth and two grandsons; Black Bull, and Kill Eagle. Iron Cradle later became an historical figure of the early Fort Belknap Indian Reservation, now located in Montana. Kurz Sketchbook 1851 portrait labeled \\"Ours Fou\\" Background Crazy Bear was born in 1785 on the northern plains somewhere in the present day Montana, North Dakota, Alberta or Saskatchewan. The area was part of the Louisiana Territory still under the control of Spain at the time. The environment into which he was born was rapidly changing. France, after taking back the Louisiana Territory from Spain, immediately sold it to the United States in the 1803 Louisiana Purchase. Some 200 years before, the Assiniboine had broken off from the Yankton Sioux, which spurred two centuries of continuous conflict between them; as well as continual warfare. Young man Crazy Bear grew up living the traditional plains Indian life. He followed and hunted the buffalo; and was taught the warrior culture. He lived a life of bravery and counted many coups. He was a born leader which was apparent to his people. Young men learning the arts of hunting, raiding and fighting had a high mortality rate. These factors, together with European diseases and the pushing of alcohol upon the Native peoples adversely impacted the survival of indigenous youth. In spite of all odds, he reached adulthood. In 1805, the Lewis & Clark Expedition made contact with some Assiniboin; \\"... between the Assiniboin (river) and the Missouri, are two bands of Assiniboins, one on the Mouse River of about two hundred men, called Assiniboin Menatopa; the other residing on both sides of White River called by the French, Gens des Feuilles, amounting to two hundred and fifty men;..\\".\\"\\"History of the Lewis and Clark Expedition,\\" by Elliott Coues, vol.1, page 217 F 592.4 1893, copy 2 The band Crazy Bear lived with were the Gens des Feuilles or The Little Girls band, in the Assiniboine language they were, \\"We che ap pe nah\\". It is possible that he had personal contact with the famous explorers when he was 20 years of age. The fur trade The information concerning his early adult life and his exploits are sparse. In a battle between the Assiniboine and the Gros Ventre, Crazy Bear fought desperately to protect the women and children of the camp. \\"The conduct of the chief in this emergency was said by his people to resemble the furious and fearless actions of a crazy bear, hence his name.\\"Ewers, John C.; Five Indian Tribes of the Upper Missouri Crazy Bear and others of his tribe participated in the burgeoning fur trade which had reached the high plains. The fur trade was originally represented by French traders known as the Coureurs des Bois (or Runners of the Woods) in the 18th and 19th centuries; and later as voyageurs and mountain men in the 19th century. Agents of Hudson's Bay Company, the North West Company, and the American Fur Company (AFC), built forts and competing trading posts along the rivers. At these facilities, the Native Americans traded furs and buffalo robes for weapons, fabric, trinkets, and whiskey. It was at one of these facilities, Ft. Union, Dakota Territory, that Crazy Bear honed his negotiation skills. He was known as an honest, loyal and reliable trading partner. The agents of the American Fur Company, which ran Ft. Union, made numerous journal entries regarding Crazy Bear and his abilities. Charles Larpenteur, an agent for the AFC, wrote in his journal in 1842 about another, competing. fur company's attempt to bribe Crazy Bear into switching affiliations. He wrote, \\"Mr. Cotton [an agent from Fort William] invited him into his room and made him a great speech, dressed him up in a splendid military suit, such as had never been brought into the country before, and then laid a two gallon keg of whiskey at his feet. Crazy Bear's band was at Union, waiting for his return; but, instead of going directly to them, he went into Mr. Culberson (the AFC agent)'s private room, not very drunk, took a seat, and remained some time without saying a word. Mr. Culbertson, surprised to see him so dressed, and thinking that he had lost his chief, was also silent. Finally, Crazy Bear broke the ice by saying, 'I suppose you think that I have left our big house. No, I am not a child. I went below to see the chief who treated me well. I did not ask him for anything. I did not refuse his presents. But these cannot make me abandon this house, where are buried the remains of our fathers, whose tracks are yet fresh in all the paths leading to this place. No I will not abandon this house!' After which he rose from his seat, and took off his fine fur hat and feathers, which he threw on the floor with all his might; then unbuckled his beautiful sword with which he did the same, and kept on till he had stripped himself of all his fine clothes, without speaking a word. When this performance was over, he said to Mr. Culbertson, who stood in great astonishment, 'Take away all these things and give me such as you see fit, and don't think I am a child who can be seduced with trinkets.' This Crazy Bear, who was not at all crazy, proved afterward to be the greatest Chief of the Assiniboine.\\"Larpenteur, Charles; Forty Years a Fur Trader on the Upper Missouri‚ÄîThe Personal Narrative of Charles Larpenteur; 1833-1872; Lakeside Press; 1933. Fort Laramie Treaty By 1851, the traffic of white settlers traveling west through the northern plains had increased steadily resulting in the escalation of violent confrontation with the native peoples. In addition, the continued inter-tribal warfare affected the profits of the competing fur companies. The United States government devised a plan to bring a cessation of hostilities to the area. They prepared a document known as the \\"Fort Laramie Treaty\\" (1851), and distributed a circular summoning the leaders of all regional tribes to Fort Laramie, Wyoming to a treaty council and signing ceremony. The tribes invited were the Sioux, Cheyenne, Arapaho, Crow, Assiniboine, Mandan, Gros Ventre, Arikaree, Shoshone, and others. Many of these nations were natural enemies; who had been fighting inter-tribal battles for centuries. Fort Laramie was in Sioux territory. The reluctance of many participants to travel to this remote location was evident. \\"When the circular issued by Col. Mitchell, then Supt. of Indian Affairs, was explained to the Assiniboines by Culbertson, not a single Indian except the Foolish Bear (Crazy Bear) would consent to go. They did not wish to risk themselves among the large body of Sioux on whose ground the treaty was to be held. Besides the road to Laramie being up on the Yellowstone in the summer, when that river is literally stocked with Blackfoot war parties, their deadly enemies, did not bode well for their safe arrival. The trip was one of extreme danger to all concerned, and nothing but the good council and great exertions of the above named gentleman induced the Indians to undertake it. After the Crazy Bear had determined to go, several others joined the expedition.\\"Five Indian Tribes of the Upper Missouri by John C. Ewers, p. 84 Among those who traveled with him were Chief First to Fly, and Father De Smet, S.J. Soldiers and civilians at Fort Laramie probably numbered under one hundred at the time of the treaty council. The officials who had expected only the leadership of the various tribes to arrive were astounded as the total number of attendees reached an estimated twelve thousand. The fort personnel and the civilian officials felt extremely frightened and feared that without warning they could be killed. They moved the treaty signing thirty five miles southeast to Henry, in today's Nebraska. The U.S. government determined that in order to effectively negotiate they needed individual \\"Chiefs\\" to sign and represent their tribes. Crazy Bear was so designated for the Assiniboine. The treaty required the cessation of all hostilities between individual Indian tribes and whites, it determined specific territories for each Indian nation, and guaranteed annuity payments from the U.S. government for fifty years. It also guaranteed protection to Indian tribes from white depredations. The Indian nations guaranteed safe passage for white settlers traveling the various western trails and agreed to the establishment of U.S. Army forts. The Chief's signed and for the most part kept their word. The U.S. government did not. They arbitrarily reduced the annuity payment from fifty years to ten years, and failed to keep white settlers, miners and hunters from trespassing on Indian territory. The U.S. government's attitude on the treaty and their failure to abide by it is illustrated in the Commissioner of Indian Affairs Annual Report of 1852 wherein Commissioner Lea states, \\"It is therefore, no matter of regret or reproach that so large a portion of our territory has been wrested from its aboriginal inhabitants and made the happy abodes of an enlightened and Christian people\\" and \\"much of the injury of which the red men and his complaints has been the inevitable consequence of his own perverse and vicious nature.\\"Montana Indian History; by Speaks Lightning; p. 76. After signing the treaty together with First to Fly, another Assiniboine Chief, the U.S. government presented them with silver medals commemorating the event. Then they returned to Fort Union. \\"But the Chief on his arrival at Fort Union was fated to mourn the loss of some of his relatives. During his absence his son, Holy Seat, had been killed by the Blackfeet, his child died and his wife hung herself. ....though much grieved at what happened, yet he behaved like a man, and as soon as he could recover sufficient spirit proceeded to make known to his people the spirit of the treaty.\\"Five Indian Tribes of the Upper Missouri by John C. Ewers, p. 85. As stated earlier, the U.S. government did not uphold their end; they were not timely in the first annual annuities and goods promised. As a result, Crazy Bear was ridiculed and demeaned by his people. \\"The old Chief stood alone against his people and maintained the equanimity of his temper. He never swerved a particle ....though he had a hard time of it with his people. However, when the gentleman above named (Culbertson) came and issued out ten thousand dollars worth of goods as the governments presents for the first year, the Indians were struck dumb and those who before reproached now flattered their ruler.\\"Five Indian Tribes of the Upper Missouri by John C. Ewers p. 85. Post-treaty The Chief then administered his tribe and maintained a peaceful relationship with the U.S. government. As a result of his family tragedy, Crazy Bear took responsibility for and raised his granddaughter Sweet Grass (Iron Cradle). In spite of the treaty, things were not going well for the Indians of the Great Plains. Increased white encroachment, disease and diminishing resources troubled the Great Chief. In a letter to Father De Smet dated July 28, 1854, he wrote, \\"I see the buffaloes decrease every year. What will become of us without help? If our children are not instructed in time, they will disappear like the game.\\"Letter IX, to the Editor of the Precis Historiques, Brussels. The Crazy Bear, An Assiniboine Chief.

His life and character can be summed up by a quotation from Denig which states, \\"The ruling Chief of the whole nation is named Mau to weet ko (Mah Toe Wit Ko) or the Foolish Bear (Crazy Bear), who has always considered a good and sensible man and lately confirmed in his office by the Commissioners at the Laramie Treaty. He is somewhat more elevated in his opinions than most of his people, but does not rank so high as a warrior as some, though he has on occasions shown an utter contempt of danger before his enemies. He is a mild, politic man, looking to the interests of his people and viewing with suspicion anything inconsistent with them. Even when a very young man he had a voice in council, respect was paid to his opinions, and he now conducts the affairs of the nation with great credit to himself and satisfaction of his followers. ....He is a sterling friend to all white men and his speeches exhibit considerable mental powers. At all events his whole mind is given to produce a good understanding between his people and the United States government. It is pleasant to perceive good and amiable qualities in a leader....\\"\\"Five Indian Tribes of the Upper Missouri\\" by John C. Ewers p.83. References * Armstrong, Virginia Irving. (1971).

It was published in Bend, Oregon by former Tektronix engineer David J. Thompson. The magazine, originally conceived as a newsletter for users of the Ferguson Big Board (a single-board CP/M computer), was published bi-monthly beginning in July 1981. It soon expanded its coverage to other board-level computers, the Kaypro computer, and general hobbyist/experimental computing, with special interest areas being robotics, interfacing, embedded systems and programming languages. The magazine routinely published circuit diagrams and source code. Micro C carried articles on a wide range of subjects, some system-specific and newsletter- like, but also covering (then) off-mainstream topics, e.g. 3D graphics, artificial intelligence, or the special needs of handicapped users. They published a 32-page catalog of CP/M and MS-DOS software, cover date Fall/Winter 1986, describing it as the second, the first having been the Spring issue. The publishers of Micro C organized free annual user conference dubbed \\"SOG\\" (Semi-Official Gathering) in Oregon. Final issue In issue 53, May 1990, Thompson wrote, \\"I'm closing down Micro C and I don't know what I'll be doing next.\\" He explained his loss of interest in the magazine, and subscribers were offered the choice to switch to one of several other magazines, including Computer Language.

It is on the Whifflet Line (a branch of the more extensive Argyle Line), 5¬Ω miles (9 km) east of Glasgow Central railway station. Train services are provided by Abellio ScotRail.  History  Carmyle station was opened in 1866 by the Rutherglen and Coatbridge Railway on their route between Coatbridge and Glasgow. The line had originally been commissioned in 1865, but for goods traffic only - passenger services started on 1 August the following year, with Carmyle opening on that date.Railscot - Rutherglen and Coatbridge Railway www.railbrit.co.uk; Retrieved 2014-01-14 Thirty years later it became a junction, upon the opening of the Glasgow Central Railway route from (then known as Bridgeton Cross) in 1897.Railscot Chronology - Glasgow Central Railway www.railbrit.co.uk; Retrieved 2014-01-14 This intersected the older route at the station, before continuing southwards to join the Lanarkshire and Ayrshire Railway at a triangular junction between and via Westburn Viaduct. This route gave access to the low level platforms at and thence to the northwestern suburbs via and . Both lines were operated from the outset (and eventually taken over) by the Caledonian Railway, before passing to the London, Midland and Scottish Railway at the 1923 Grouping. They then became part of the Scottish Region of British Railways upon nationalisation in January 1948. The Glasgow Central Railway line and platforms closed to passengers on 5 October 1964Passengers No More by G.Daniels and L.Dench second edition p. 34 as a result of the Beeching Axe. The GCR route was subsequently dismantled and few traces of it remain today (the old platforms were demolished when the M74 motorway extension was built), but the line from Rutherglen was retained for freight traffic (mainly to/from the Ravenscraig steelworks) and periodic passenger diversions. It was then reopened as the Whifflet Line with financial backing from the Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive in 1993, with Carmyle regaining its passenger service on 4 October that year by British Rail. It was the first station stop on the reopened line after leaving the main line station at Glasgow Central, as the main line platforms at (which the original R&CR; had served) had been closed following the reopening of the Argyle Line in 1979. Electrification of the route through the station was completed in December 2014, which was not in time for the Glasgow Commonwealth Games as originally planned.Whifflet Line to be electrified before 2014 GamesBBC News; Retrieved 2014-01-14 The old Diesel Multiple Unit service from Central High Level has been replaced by EMUs running via Rutherglen and the Argyle Line. This has seen the restoration of the link to Central Low Level and beyond originally lost back in 1964.  Services  A half-hourly service operates to and from Dalmuir via Glasgow Central Low Level through to Whifflet on Mondays to Saturdays.National Rail Timetable 2014-15; Table 225 Every second train is extended to/from Motherwell.

books, published in 1957. This book sees Jansson adopt a darker, more introspective tone compared to the earlier books that is continued in the remainder of the series. Often in the book Moomintroll is either lonely, miserable, angry or scared - the result of being forced to survive in a world to which he feels he does not belong. While preserving the charm of the previous novels, the story involves a more in-depth exploration of Moomintroll's character than before. Moominland Midwinter forms the adapted of episodes 22, 23 and 37 in the 1990 TV series. Plot summary While the rest of the Moomin family are in the deep slumber of their winter hibernation, Moomintroll finds himself awake and unable to get back to sleep. He discovers a world hitherto unknown to him, where the sun does not rise and the ground is covered with cold, white, wet powder. Moomintroll is lonely at first but soon meets Too-ticky, a wise spirit who sings mysterious songs, and his old friend Little My (who takes delight in sledging down the snowy hills on Moominmamma's silver tea tray). The friends build a snow horse for the Lady Of The Cold and mourn the passing of an absent-minded squirrel who gazed into the Lady's eyes and froze to death. However, a squirrel is spotted alive by Moomintroll at the end of the book, and it seems that it may have come back to life. As the haunting winter progresses, many characters (notably the Groke, Sorry-oo the small dog, and a boisterous skiing Hemulen) come to Moominvalley in search of warmth, shelter and Moominmamma's stores of jam.

His monologues were subtle and dealt with a variety of topics, starting with politics and ending up with mythical concepts. In each and every monologue he added a personal touch to the script, thus creating a warm and humorous atmosphere. He died in Bucharest, during the earthquake of 4 March 1977.

The school offers the college preparatory studiespesialisering (literally: specialization for studies) of the Norwegian school system. Oslo Cathedral School is one of four schools in Norway which can trace its origins directly to the Middle Ages and is generally regarded as one of the most prestigious schools in Norway. It celebrated its 850-year anniversary in 2003.Oslo katedralskole  Jubileumssider The school's motto is the Latin phrase Non scholae, sed vitae discimus (We do not learn for the sake of the school, but for the sake of life), in contrast to the former motto; Non vitae, sed scholae discimus (We do not learn for the sake of life, but for the sake of the school). History According to tradition, the school was founded in 1153 by papal delegate Cardinal Nicholas Breakspeare, and administered by the Cathedral of Saint Hallvard.Oslo katedralskole  Historie From its foundation and until the 18th century the school was primarily a school for educating priests. Thus, the school's teaching traditions was from the start that of the Roman Catholic Church. As with most of Europe at the time, lessons were based on an educational curriculum known as the Liberal arts. This curriculum consisted of seven different subjects the students were required to learn, and they were ordered in two groups: Trivium and Quadrivium. The Trivium (Latin for three ways) comprising the three subjects that were taught first, grammar, logic, and rhetoric. After Trivium followed the Quadrivium (Latin for four ways), being geometry, arithmetic, music, and astronomy. The language used was Latin and remained so until the 18th century. Unlike most other Norwegian state schools, Latin is still being taught at the school today. The 17th century is in the school's history known as \\"Det l√¶rde √•rhundre\\"Ernst Bjerke: En historikk (See \\"Historie\\") (in Norwegian), Oslo Katedralskole, retrieved December 11, 2012 (literally the learned century), because some of the school's teachers were among the most educated scholars in Norway at the time. After a great fire destroyed much of Oslo in 1624, the city was relocated and reconstructed, forcing the school to change location. After a new gymnasium was opened in Christiania (Oslo's name until 1878), students were offered lessons in extracurricular subjects, including astronomy, philosophy, physics and metaphysics. Oslo Cathedral School in 1902 (Current building, street view) During the end of the 18th century, several reforms were implemented in Norwegian Latin-schools. The students' mother tongue was finally given room in the lessons, Natural science was given more priority and school libraries were established. Disciplinary punishment was only to be used if it could not be avoided and ideas from the contemporary Age of Enlightenment were also implemented, one of them being the encouragement of students to do their best The tradition of Latin being mandatory was abolished in 1869 and students were given the opportunity between a three-year-long school run with either Latin or natural sciences. During World War II, parts of the school building were employed by the German occupants, though teaching continued as usual. Several of the teachers were however involved in resistance activities against the Germans. One of the central figures of this resistance was caught while escaping to Sweden and subsequently committed suicide in prison to avoid being coerced into revealing the resistance's activities.

Killarney is located about from the Queensland/New South Wales border. It is close to Queen Mary Falls in the Main Range National Park, where Spring Creek plunges into the valley. Mountain View is a neighbourhood within the locality of Killarney (). Melrose is a neighbourhood within the locality of Killarney (); it is associated with the Melrose pastoral station. History The Githabal (also known as Gidabal, Kitabal) language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Southern Downs Regional Council, particularly Warwick, Killarney and Woodenbong extending into New South Wales. Killarney bordered on the northern boundaries of the Yetimarala. Originally part of Canning Downs, established by the Leslie brothers in 1840, the development of the town was largely based on primary production and forestry. The name of the district was chosen by the Hon. Peter Murray, who was visiting George Leslie at the Canning Downs pastoral station and commented that the scenery reminded him of Killarney in County Kerry, Ireland. Killarney State School was established on 17 August 1874. However, it was not until 1 January 1876 that teacher Gwyther Hill was appointed and students enrolled. The South Killarney town site was first surveyed in 1878, but the town already boasted several shops and services by this time. Many early settlers to Queensland selected land in the Killarney area with the first of these arriving in 1863. During the 1880s Killarney was described as \\"one of the most flourishing towns in Southern Queensland\\".Killarney & District Historical Society, Memories of Killarney & District.

Wynola State School was established in 1935 at River Bank from the town of Killarney, following the discovery that several families in that district were illiterate. It is presumed the school was in the vicinity of the Wynola pastoral station () to the north-east of the town on the Condamine River Road. The school building from the closed Melrose State School was relocated to establish the new school. The school was officially opened on 19 October 1935 by John Healy, the Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly for Warwick. The school closed circa 1941. The town was hit by a destructive tornado on Friday 22 November 1968, which destroyed many of the original buildings.

Guilford, CT: Falcon Guide. . p 549. Melzer's is toxic to humans if ingested due to the presence of iodine and chloral hydrate. Due to the legal status of chloral hydrate, Melzer's reagent is difficult to obtain in the United States. To cope with the problems procuring chloral hydrate, Rutgers scientists have developed a working substitute for use in Microscopy known as Visikol‚Ñ¢,http://otc.rutgers.edu/pdf/Simon-2012-146.pdf which is compatible with Lugol's iodine, forming an easy to get but mediocre replacement for Melzer's. Melzer's reagent is part of a class of iodine/potassium iodide (IKI)-containing reagents used in biology; Lugol's iodine is another such formula. Reactions Melzer's is used by exposing fungal tissue or cells to the reagent, typically in a microscope slide preparation, and looking for any of three color reactions: * Amyloid or Melzer's-positive reaction, in which the material reacts blue to black. * Pseudoamyloid or dextrinoid reaction, in which the material reacts brown to reddish brown. * Inamyloid or Melzer's-negative, in which the tissues do not change color, or react faintly yellow-brown. Among the amyloid reaction, two types can be distinguished: * Euamyloid reaction, in which the material turns blue without potassium hydroxide (KOH)-pretreatment. * Hemiamyloid reaction, in which the material turns red in Lugol's solution, but shows no reaction in Melzer's reagent; when KOH-pretreated it turns blue in both reagents (hemiamyloidity).Baral H-O. 1987. Lugol's solution/IKI versus Melzer's reagent: Hemiamyloidity, a universal feature of the ascus wall. Mycotaxon 29:399‚Äì450. Melzer's reactions are typically almost immediate, though in some cases the reaction may take up to 20 minutes to develop. The function of the chemicals that make up Melzer's reagent are several. The chloral hydrate is a clearing agent, bleaching and improving the transparency of various dark-colored microscopic materials. The potassium iodide is used to improve the solubility of the iodine, which is otherwise only semi-soluble in water. Iodine is thought to be the main active staining agent in Melzer's; it is thought to react with starch-like polysaccharides in the cell walls of amyloid material, however, its mechanism of action is not entirely understood. It has been observed that hemiamyloid material reacts differently when exposed to Melzer's than it does when exposed to other IKI solutions such as Lugol's, and that in some cases an amyloid reaction is shown in material that had prior exposure to KOH, but an inamyloid reaction without such pretreatment.Kohn LM, Korf RP. 1975. Variation in ascomycete iodine reactions: KOH pretreatment explored. Mycotaxon 3:165‚Äì172. An experiment in which spores from 35 species of basidiomycetes were tested for reactions to both Melzer's and Lugol's showed that spores in a large percentage of the species tested display very different reactions between the two reagents. These varied from being weakly or non-reactive in Lugols, to giving iodine-positive reactions in Lugol's but not in Melzer's, to even giving dextrinoid reactions in Lugol's while giving amyloid reactions in Melzer's.. Melzer's degrades into a cloudy precipitate when combined with alkaline solutions, hence it cannot be used in combination or in direct series with such common mycological reagents such as potassium hydroxide or ammonium hydroxide solutions. When potassium hydroxide is used as a pretreatment, the alkalinity must be first neutralized before adding Melzer's. History The use of iodine-containing solutions as an aid to describing and identifying fungi dates back to the mid-19th century. Melzer's reagent was first described in 1924 and takes its name from its inventor, the mycologist V√°clav Melzer, who modified an older chloral hydrate-containing IKI solution developed by botanist Arthur Meyer. Melzer was a specialist in Russula, a genus in which the amyloidy on the spore ornamentation or entire spore is of great taxonomic significance.The Russulales News Team. 2007.

His paternal grandfather (professor of linguistics at the Berlin Humboldt Institute Carl Abel) and maternal grandmother were Jewish but converted to Christianity.Hans Werner Sinn, On the European Roots of Richard Abel Musgrave He turned from the field of literature, with an interest in becoming a stage director, to philosophy and economics at the Universities of Munich and Heidelberg (Diplom-Volkswirt, 1933), then at Harvard (Ph.D., 1937).Peggy B.

After that, he spent four years as a research economist at the Federal Reserve and taught at several American universities, including the University of Michigan where he worked on his treatise from 1951 to 1959.Richard A. Musgrave (1959). The Theory of Public Finance, p. ix. He served as an advisor to the US government and returned to Harvard in 1965 as H. H. Burbank professor of Political Economy in the faculty of Arts and Sciences and the Law School. He was also editor of the Quarterly Journal of Economics. His book The Theory of Public Finance (1959) remains a leading theoretical work. Public Finance in Theory and Practice (1973), co- authored with his wife, Peggy Brewer Musgrave, was a leading textbook for many years. Career in economics Martin Feldstein is quoted in the New York Times obituary (Jan 20, 2007) \\"Richard Musgrave transformed economics in the 1950s and 1960s from a descriptive and institutional subject to one that used the tools of Microeconomics and Keynesian Macroeconomics to understand the effect of taxes.\\" Musgrave published his seminal paper, \\"Voluntary Exchange Theory of Public Economy\\" in the Quarterly Journal of Economics in 1939. Paul Samuelson would later convert this from a positive theory to a normative theory. It is from the 1939 paper \\"Voluntary Exchange Theory of Public Economy\\" that 'The Musgrave Three-Function Framework' originates. This framework is the suggestion that government activity should be separated into three functions or \\"branches,\\" macroeconomic stabilization, income redistribution and resource allocation. The stabilization branch is to assure the achievement of high employment and price stability, the distribution branch is to achieve an equitable distribution of income, and the allocation branch is to see that resources are used efficiently. This conceptual division of the responsibilities of government allows us to narrow the scope of inquiry into tax assignment, by indicating which of the three functions are most appropriately assigned to various levels of government. The remainder of this section focuses on the implications of the three-branch framework for the assignment of revenue sources among levels of government, especially the assignment between the central government and second-tier governments. In his paper, \\"A Multiple Theory of Budget Determination,\\" published in Finanzarchiv 1957, Musgrave introduced the economic concept of merit good (and later, de- merit good). The concept has been extensively discussed elsewhere and been quite controversial in economic theory. His background in the German, Austrian, Italian and Swedish schools of political economy plus the uniquely German contribution of Finanzwissenschaft, or fiscal sociology, gave him a unique position to make a contribution to postwar government finance theory. Accolades Musgrave was elected a Fellow in American Academy of Arts and Sciences, honorary member of the National Tax Association, and honorary President of the Institute of Public Finance (1978). Awarded the Frank E Seidman award in Political Economy (1981), honorary doctorates from Alleghany college, University of Heidelberg, University of Milan, University of Michigan, and the University of Munich, he was a professor emeritus at Harvard until his death, and an adjunct Professor at the University of California at Santa Cruz. Musgrave was designated a Distinguished Fellow by the American Economic Association in 1978, along with William S. Vickrey.

Adams achieved fame by being selected by Wisden as one of its five Cricketers of the Year in 1919 when the choice was restricted because of the lack of first-class cricket the previous summer. Adams was a batsman and wicketkeeper at Cheltenham College. Unlike others of the schoolboys selected by Wisden in both 1918 and 1919, he did not go on to a prominent career in first-class cricket: he played just one match for Sussex, against Cambridge University in 1922, scoring two runs and making one stumping.

In October 1988 ‚Äì in a secondary school in Strasbourg ‚Äì Franck George and Eric K.Guerrier meet. So begins the musical adventure of the aforementioned Weepers Circus, \\"the circus of those who shed tears\\". They are quickly joined by Alexandre (Franck's brother) and Denis Leonhardt. All have an average age of 16. From 1988 to 1995, high school and university life gradually draws in other musicians: some who stay and who still collaborate with them, while others take their own paths... There arises numerous small concerts in Strasbourg: museums, theatres, universities, churches, cafes, etc... In 1993 the Weepers Circus develop music for a documentary on the stained glass windows of St. Paul's church in Strasbourg ; participate in conceptualizing titles for French TV (Arte and France 3) ; compose the shows Requiem (1992) and Fables (1994). These works stand apart from a discography point of view, for the time being. The years 1995 and 1996 see the publication of a debut single entitled Weepers Circus, composed of three original titles. Participation follows in two collective records of regional acts. The Weepers Circus really take off in 1997 with a first album Le Fou et La Balance (\\"The Madman and the Scales\\"), followed by their first national tour, which consists mostly of playing in the markets of Brittany and Berrychons! In 1998 the group publish a second single entitled Je suis noble (\\"I am noble\\"). In 1999 there appears a second album, L'Epouvantail (\\"The Scarecrow\\"), from which a second tour is organised, which is much more intensive in terms of the number of dates. In 2000, the group is signed with Philips/Universal and Universal Publishing. The result is a third album, L'Ombre et la Demoiselle (\\"The Shadow and the Young Lady\\"), in which there figures a duet with the group Bratsch. A third national tour is organised. At this point in time Caroline Loeb, the delectable singer of C'est la Ouate (in English the title was And so what) ‚Äì who put on the play Shirley, the spectacles of Lio or Victor Lazlo - takes a liking to them (which is reciprocated), and decides to occupy herself with the image of our Weepers, going so far as to even dress them in clothes by Jean- Paul Gaultier! In 2001, the publication of their third album \\"The Circus of those who weep\\" bring the group to their first experience of shooting a video! Nicolas Bonnefous is the director. An almightily statuesque fellow ! The video is aired about forty times on M6 and MCM (French TV) between February and May. In February of the same year, the group is introduced to Richard Lornak, the brilliant and very friendly pianist of the radio program Le Fou du Roi on France Inter. The result: the Weepers Circus and Richard record together a cover of a song by Georges Brassens (unknown of at the time). They warmly welcomes him to join them on the stage of Caf√© de la Dance (in Paris) for a memorable concert! In March, the Weepers Circus welcome a new musician: Alexandre Bertrand (called \\"Goulec\\") on drums! United through friendship and music, the objective is to modify, renew and revamp their own compositions. In May they meet T√™tes Raides during the festival Paroles et Musiques of Saint- Etienne. A duet (covering a song by Brassens) is presented to the audience. In July, on a record which is a collection effort in hommage of Georges Brassens called Les Oiseaux de Passage, the Weepers Circus cover Quatre-vingt quinze pour cent (\\"Ninety-five percent\\"). The song is arranged in collaboration with Joseph Racaille (who work with Alain Bashung, Thomas Fersen, etc.). The years 1997/2000 are thus a fabulous adventure. Around the records and the video, pretty ballads are born that the Weepers offer around the whole of France to an adorable audience, faithful and ever more numerous: an average of one hundred gigs per year since 1997. There are also many radio shows in which they participate (France Inter, FIP, France Info, France Culture, RTL, Europe 1, local radio stations etc.) as well as television shows (M6, France 2, France 3 national and regional, LCI, TV Breizh, cable TV, etc.) In June 2002, the Weepers Circus make the acquaintance of the charming Olivia Ruiz'. The Lady contacts them and requests a song from them for her first solo album. From September 2002 to February 2003, they record their fourth album Faites Entrer (\\"Make Enter\\"), for the most part in the magnificent alsatian chateau of Lichtenberg! Many are invited, in particular Serge Begout (T√™tes Raides), on the trumpet, with whom the group live a real musical friendship. The sweet Olivia Ruiz is equally present on La Renarde (\\"The Vixen\\") and Je Vole (\\"I'm Flying\\"), as well as their great and dear friend Isabelle Lux who, for a third time, do them the honour to lend her voice on A poings ferm√©s (\\"With closed Fists\\"). The album Faites Entrer is published 22 April 2003. The French tour of the group begins in October 2003. In 2003 and 2004, on numerous occasions, Olivia Ruiz plays a lead role in the Weepers Circus and/or in duet (on stage and on France Inter). Olivia Ruiz' album J'aime pas l'amour (\\"I don't Like Love\\") is published 7 September 2003: the Weepers Circus participate on the track, Petite Fable (\\"Small Fable\\"). In 2004, in Strasbourg, Serge Begout plays in duet with the Weepers Circus. Boris Plateau creates an animated video around the title Le bouffon et la controverse (\\"The buffon and the Controversies\\") (an extract of the simple Je suis noble, published in 1998). The same year, the production and transmission of a documentary ‚Äì by Didier Varrod and Godwin Djadja ‚Äì devoted to Olivia Ruiz: Star activiste (\\"Activist star\\"). The top prize of the Acad√©mie Charles Cros. The Weepers Circus make an appearance in this film. In 2004, publication of the album Terrain Vague (\\"Waste ground\\") by the Ogres de Barback: the Weepers Circus participate in the track 3-0 along with a good number of other guests. In 2005, the recording and publishing of the 5th album of the Weepers Circus: La Monstrueuse Parade (\\"The Monstrous Parade\\"), in hommage of Freaks 1932 by Tod Browning. Olivia Ruiz is once again invited to play on the track Sans vous aimer (\\"Without loving you\\"). The sixth album, \\"Tout n'est plus si noir\\" is published in 2007. Several guest artists contribute to the recording, including Mathias Malzieu (leader of the French rock band Dionysos), Olivia Ruiz and Irene Jacob. Christian Houll√©, who had already made such videos for the group's previous albums, joined the band in 2007. After a lengthy tour in France and Europe, appeared in March 2009 the seventh album simply titled \\"Live\\", including a previously unreleased remix (with a video) titled \\"Tout le monde chante\\" (remixed by Les Gaillard, a collective of young arrangers of France, fans of rap and slam) and a cover of Led Zeppelin: Kashmir. In 2009 still, the Weepers Circus participates in the new album by Caroline Loeb (while having completed the soundtrack opening of his show \\"Mistinguett, Madonna and Me\\"), as well as the fifth album of grind metal Inhumate. He also composes music for a play put on by La Compagnie S√©maphore (directed by Denis Woelffel) on a text by Philippe Dorin (\\"Dans ma maison de papier, j'ai des po√®mes sur le feu\\"). The group released its eighth album in November 2009. Entitled \\"√Ä la r√©cr√©\\", it is a great format book-disk of songs for children (illustrated by Tomi Ungerer), comprising both classic children's song and original compositions. Many guests are part: Serge B√©gout (guitarist of the French rock band T√™tes Raides), Fr√©d√©rique Bel, Agn√®s Bonfillon, Emma Daumas, Juliette, Didier Lockwood, Caroline Loeb, Christine Ott, Olivia Ruiz, Roger Siffer, etc. At the same time on tour with \\"√Ä la r√©cr√©\\" (for the young people) and on tour \\"for all public\\" since December 2009, the group is currently writing a ninth album (studio) to be published in October 2011 and whose title is \\"N'importe o√π, hors du monde\\". The group will return once again in question by injecting electro-pop influences, a unique sound research and lush arrangements. In addition, the group is in preparation for participation in a new collective album of covers of songs by Georges Brassens, and a collective album of songs composed from poems by Matthias Vincenot.

It is a segment of a three-part theory that works to explain the behavior of yield curves for interest rates. The upwards- curving component of the interest yield can be explained by the liquidity premium. The reason behind this is that short term securities are less risky compared to long term rates due to the difference in maturity dates. Therefore investors expect a premium, or risk premium for investing in the risky security. Liquidity risk premiums are recommended to be used with longer term investments, where those particular investments are illiquid. Assets that are traded on an organized market are more liquid. Financial disclosure requirements are more stringent for quoted companies. For a given economic result, organized liquidity and transparency make the value of quoted share higher than the market value of an unquoted share.  Pricing Liquidity Premium  Practitioners struggle with the valuation of illiquid securities. Longstaff (1995) calculates the upper bound for this premium by assuming that without trading restrictions, an investor with perfect market-timing ability can sell a security at its maximum price during the period in which the security is restricted from trading. Thus, the upper bound for the liquidity premium is priced as the difference between this maximum price during the restricted trading period and the security price at the end of this period. Abudy and Raviv (2016) extend this framework for the special case of corporate bonds by using a structural approach for pricing a corporate security. Consistent with the empirical literature the liquidity premium is positively related to the issuing firm‚Äôs asset risk and leverage ratio and increases with a bond‚Äôs credit quality. The term structure of illiquidity spread has a humped shape, where its maximum level depends on the firm‚Äôs leverage ratio.

University of Glasgow Life Macintyre was born in High Street, Glasgow. His father was a tailor. His mother was related to the missionary and explorer David Livingstone. Macintyre originally trained as an electrical engineer and worked as an apprentice electrician before enrolling to the University of Glasgow in 1878. There he changed his field for medicine and graduated in 1882 with the Bachelor of Medicine degree. He then worked as a naval surgeon in London, Paris and Vienna, and returned to Glasgow to assume a position of a Surgeon for Diseases of the Throat at Anderson's College Dispensary. He later established a private practice specialising in the treatment of singers and actors. As part of his interest in the larynx he was responsible for creating the first self-illuminated endoscope around 1894/5.http://sshm.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/PROCEEDINGS- SESSION-1994-1995-and-1995-1996.pdf Macintyre is mostly known for applying his electrical engineering knowledge to medicine. In 1885 he became Consulting Medical Electrician at Glasgow Royal Infirmary where he established a \\"department for the application of medical electricity\\" in 1887. In 1893 he became President of the British Laryngological Society. In 1895 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were John Gray McKendrick, James Thomson Bottomley, Magnus Maclean and William Jack. Late in 1895, X-rays were discovered by Wilhelm R√∂ntgen. On 5 February 1896 James Thomson Bottomley asked McIntyre to demonstrate an x-ray machine created by his uncle, William Thomson, Lord Kelvin following instructions from Rontgen (Lord Kelvin was ill and could not attend). The demonstration took place at Glasgow Royal Infirmary and was the first use of x-rays in Scotland. All Scottish hospitals introduced x-ray machines within the next 12 months. Macintyre went further and recorded an X-ray movie of the moving legs of a frog, and presented the results in a report \\"On Roentgen X-Rays, or the new photography\\" to the Philosophical Society of Glasgow in 1896. In the same year, he set up the world's first radiology department at the Glasgow Royal Infirmary, where X-ray photographs were used in the diagnosis and treatment of patients. There, Macintyre produced the first images of renal stones and various inner body parts. For his groundbreaking work, he received many awards and honours. In 1897 he moved to London and founded the Rontgen Society of London. He served as their first President. He was also President of the West of Scotland Branch of the British Medical Association, Corresponding Fellow of the American and French Laryngological Associations, Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and of the Royal Microscopical Society, among other posts.John Macintyre Strathclyde University He died on 29 October 1928.

He first appeared in Marvel Team-Up vol. 1 #110, as an enemy of Spider-Man and Iron Man. Fictional character biography Jonathan Darque was the chief executive officer of a mining company investigating new and cheap sources of energy. His investigations were opposed by environmental activists, who held demonstrations at his trial bore sites. His wife died in a car crash when attempting to evade the activists' blockade. Darque used his engineering skills to design a battle suit allowing him to become Magma. He then developed an underground crime organization. Darque/Magma created a device he called the Long Range Sonic Stata Scanner (LRSSS), which enabled him to discover the epicentres of earthquakes before they erupted. He also used the machine to generate waves causing earthquakes; this enabled him to blackmail the Mayor of New York City. (At the publication time of this story, the historical Mayor was Ed Koch). Magma held a press conference to reveal his plans. Spider-Man and Iron Man joined forces to drill down vertically to reach the source of the earthquake, where they discovered his hidden base. After Magma was defeated by Spider-Man and Iron Man in a battle on the surface, he escaped in a pod into the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Spider-Man aimed the LRSSS at this location and Magma was engulfed by the resultant waves and he disappeared into the depths of the ocean. Magma was eventually arrested after several attempts to take over Stark Industries and some battles on the surface with Jim Rhodes in the Iron Man armor. Subsequently Darque was paid by Roxxon Oil Company and offered a job to lead a secret research laboratory located in the middle of a mountain, part of the Ridge-and-valley Appalachians in Virginia. With the unwilling assistance of \\"idiot savant\\" Seth Hanks, a local boy, Darque attempted to develop a new electron projector that would allow powerful beams to be directed at Earth from a satellite. Spider-Man saved his colleague, the child and his mother from Magma's base and, accidentally, caused the collapse of the cave destroying the laboratory.Web of Spider-Man vol. 1, #16-17 He fought the Human Torch in Brooklyn, where the Fantastic Four member's fire proved to be greater than the fire resistance of Magma's metal body. The fire melted Magma's equipment, and the asphalt under his feet, meaning that he was unable to continue the fight. Powers and abilities Magma's body armor was strong enough to survive a freefall from a ten-story building and was able to withstand 1200 degrees Celsius (the temperature of the magma under the Earth's crust). His armor was also able to protect him from intense nuclear radiation. Magma wore a spiked vest made of the same material as his armor. In addition, Magma had a blast gun implanted in his right arm that was able to fire balls of lava, which were created by a generator worn on his back.

Donald was Regius Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the University of Glasgow. Donald's work was characterised by a series of collaborations between clinicians and engineers that led to the designing and building of a series of instruments that enabled the examination of the unborn and that eventually enabled him to build the world's first obstetric ultrasound machine, the Diasonograph in 1963. His other great achievement was to secure the construction of the Queen Mother's Maternity Hospital that was built next to the Royal Hospital for Children in Glasgow. Life Donald was born to John Donald and Helen n√©e Barron Wilson in 1910. His father was a general practitioner who came from a paisley medical family. His grandfather was also a GP. His mother was a concert pianist. Donald was the eldest of four children and his siblings were Margaret, Alison, and Malcolm. His sister Alison Munro would later become a leading headmistress. Donald took his early education at the Warriston School preparatory school in Moffat and then his secondary education was completed at Fettes College, Edinburgh. However, Donald never completed his education in Scotland as the family decided to move to South Africa due to his father's poor health. Donald continued his secondary education at Diocesan College in Rondebosch where he studied the classics as well as music, philosophy, and languages. In 1927 Donald's mother and two of his siblings contracted diphtheria and his mother died of a myocardial infarction. Three months later Donald's father died. Maud Grant, the housekeeper, with a trust fund was left to care for the children. Also in the same year, Donald achieved a Bachelor of Arts (BA) in arts and music at the University of Cape Town graduating with a First-class honours. Achieving a BA is considered a traditional route to start medical school. In 1930 the family moved back to London and Donald matriculated at the University of London to study medicine at the St Thomas's Hospital Medical School. In 1937 Donald achieved a Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery at St Thomas's becoming the third generation of doctors in Donald's family. At the end of his graduate education, Donald married Alix Mathilde de Chazal Richards a farmer's daughter from the Orange Free State. Donald retired on 1 October 1976. He was offered a consultancy at Nuclear Enterprises in Edinburgh, a position he held until 1981. After he fully retired, he moved to Paglesham, an area known for sailing and yachting, which he loved doing all his life. Donald passed away quietly on 19 June 1987. He was survived by his wife, his four daughters and thirteen grandchildren. He was buried in the churchyard at St Peters Church, in Paglesham, Essex. Career Donald started his postgraduate medical training at the end of the 1930s planning to specialise in Obstetrics with a position in Obstetrics and Gynaecology at St Thomas's and in 1939 he started his residency. Donald's medical career was interrupted by the arrival of World War II and in May 1942 he was drafted into the Royal Air Force as a medical officer to do his bit. He was so successful in the role that he was mentioned in dispatches for bravery after he pulled several airmen from an bomber that had crashed and had set on fire while the bombs were still in the airframe. In 1946 he was awarded a MBE for bravery. During his time with the RAF, Donald became aware of a variety of techniques involving Radar and Sonar. In 1946 Donald completed his war service and returned to work at St Thomas's. In 1949 he was appointed as a tutor in the department of obstetrics and gynaecology. By 1949 the National Health Service was in operation for three years and instead of the continual search for money for patient care, money now came from government taxes, so the hospital's role changed from a needs based approach to a focus on research. Specifically each doctor now had to conduct a research project as part of their remit. Negative-pressure respirator In partnership with Maureen Young a specialist in perinatal physiology, Donald conducted a study of respiratory disorders in infants. Donald's study included an examination of available medical respirators and he was not satisfied with the design and efficiency of operation of the current models. Donald had an interest in mechanical and technological devices from childhood, so he decided to build a new respirator. By 1952 Donald and Young had built a new medical negative-pressure respirator that they demonstrated at the meeting of the Physiological Society in a room at the Royal Free Hospital. Trip Spirometer Later in 1952 Donald resigned his role at St Thomas's to take up a position as a reader at the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Royal Postgraduate Medical School located in Hammersmith Hospital. At the medical school Donald continued his research into neonatal breathing disorders. Donald worked to improve the Servo patient-cycled respirator as the device that Donald and Young had built. Later working with Josephine Lord, a registrar, Donald built a new piece of equipment called the Trip Spirometer later called the Spirometer whose purpose was to measure the respiratory efficiency of a neonate. As well as being a diagnostic device, Donald used the device to make a quantitative determination of normal respiration with the goal of determining the physiology and pathology of neonatal pulmonary disease. Puffer In 1953 Donald published a review of the best practice in neonatal resuscitation of the newborn. While at the school, Donald worked on a third device, a positive-pressure respirator. Donald found that the negative- pressure device he had built with Young was not ideal as it was complicated to setup and difficult to use, requiring more than one person to operate. Indeed, the Servo respirator seemed to be ideally suited to long-term treatment of babies with breathing difficulties. His rationale for creating a new device was based on the idea that a respirator was needed that could be used with a mask applied to a child in a cot or incubator. He built a positive-pressure respirator that was later known in Hammersmith Hospital as the Puffer. The Puffer device sent a stream of oxygen mixture to the baby's face and the device could be applied to an ailing baby in under a minute. After treating several babies, colleagues requested that he convert the device to treat adults which he did with successful outcomes. This work came to the notice of the British Oxygen Company who wanted to commercially develop the positive- pressure respirator. In May 1954, Donald delivered the Blair-Bell Lecture at the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. He spoke about Atelectasis Neonatorum and how his respirator could improve the management of the condition. In the same period he met the biologist, electrical engineer and inventor John J. Wild in London. Wild had discussed the use of ultrasound with him. Wild had used pulse-echo ultrasound to visualize abnormal tissue in the human breast. In September 1954 he was appointed by Hector Hetherington to Regius Professor of Midwifery. Hetherington had to confirm the position with the Secretary of State for Scotland as it was a government appointment and Donald was proud of his commission that was signed personally by the Queen. Although Donald was impressed by Hetherington, Donald made it a condition of his employment that Hetherington had to promise to build a new maternity hospital in Glasgow, which he did. Obstetric Ultrasound The Diasonograph, the first ever ultrasound scanner for use in obstetrics Whilst Professor of Regius Midwifery at Glasgow University, he first explored the use of obstetric ultrasound in the 1950s and through collaboration with John MacVicar, a registrar and obstetrician in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the Western Infirmary and Tom Brown an industrial engineer who worked for Kelvin & Hughes Scientific Instrument Company, developed the first contact compound sector scanner and an article in The Lancet called Investigation of Abdominal Masses by Pulsed Ultrasound. The article contained the first ultrasound image of a fetus ever published. The development of Donald's interest in ultrasound started when one of his patients introduced her husband to Donald. The patient's husband was the director of the boiler fabrication company Babcock and Wilcox and he offered a tour of the plant to Donald who accepted. Babcock and Wilcox in Renfrew was a large user of industrial ultrasound that was used to check for crack and flaws in welds. Donald's purpose in making the visit to Renfrew on 21 July 1955 was to determine if the industrial detecting equipment could be used to differentiate types of tissue. Donald arrived at the plant with a number of fibroids and a large ovarian cyst taken from gynaecology patients. When Donald came across Bernard Donnelly, an employee in the research department of the boilermaker, Donald asked him to demonstrate the devices use by taking an ultrasound image of the bone of his thumb. Donald experimented with the tissue samples along with a huge steak the company had provided for a control and thereby confirmed the fact that ultrasound could be used to scan biological material. The results surprised him. He stated: :All I wanted to know, quite simply, was whether these various masses differed in their ultrasonic echo characteristics. The results were beyond my wildest dreams and even with the primitive apparatus of those days clearly showed that a cyst produced echoes only at depth from the near and far walls, whereas a solid tumour progressively attenuated echoes at increasing depths of penetration. When he returned to hospital, Donald's goal was to find an ultrasound machine that he could continue to experiment with. He obtained a Kelvin Hughes Mark lIb supersonic flaw detector from William Valentine Mayneord at the Royal Cancer Hospital. While Mayneord had been experimenting with the machine, trying to image the brain, he had been unsuccessful in his efforts, Donald hoped he could replicate and improve upon his previous success. However, he found that when using the machine it could not produce echoes from less than 8 cm from the face of the transducer, making it almost useless for obstetric diagnostics. Donald experimented with balloons and condoms filled with water, to use up the 8 cm gap with little success. At the time Donald was being assisted by John Lenihan, a Professor of Clinical Physics, who was helping him to form image but the Mark IIb was insufficient for the task and the images produced were of very poor quality. =Experiments with A-mode scanner= It was in late 1956 when Tom Brown, a research engineer with Kelvin & Hughes, became involved. Brown although relatively young at twenty-three, had previously worked on an automatic flaw detector for testing of industrial products. It was while working in the Western Infirmary installing a bulb in a theatre that Brown found out that Donald was using the flaw detector.Brown, Tom (Unpublished article) Development of ultrasonic scanning techniques in Scotland 1956-1979, 1994 Brown immediately looked up Donald in the Infirmary directory, phoned him and arranged a meeting. When they met, Brown noticed that the Mark lIb was not manufactured by Kelvin & Hughes but instead had been manufactured under contract. He also noticed that the machine had been converted from using a double probe, one to produce pulses and one to receive the pulses to a single probe. Not wanting to insult Donald by explaining why the machine was not working correctly, Brown offered to try and source another machine from somewhere. Brown phoned Alex Rankin, the man who collaborated with Brown on the automatic flaw detector for help and who would later be director of the department of Medical Ultrasonics at the company. Rankin offered to gift the latest Mk IV Flaw Detector which was subsequently forwarded to Glasgow Central station from the Barkingside Labs location of Messrs Kelvin & Hughes, for delivery to Brown. Rankin also spoke to the three directors at the company who decided to vote ¬£500, a not inconsiderable sum on those days to support experiments. An A-mode scan created by Ian Donald in 1956. Note the large non-reflective space between two echoes which marks the presence of a large ovarian cyst The new machine was considerably improved on the older machine with the difference being described as chalk and cheese by Donald. It was a double transducer probe machine. At the same time Brown was able to scrounge a 'Cossor' oscilloscope camera which enabled images to be recorded on 35mm film. For Donald the camera was particularly significant as it enabled a record to be kept, an archive of images to created and they could be printed in published works. Donald set about establishing a framework of use for the device, how it could be used, what the information on the screen meant. In 1956 the obstetrician John MacVicar was appointed as a registrar at the Western Infirmary and joined the team. He would later become the Foundation Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the University of Leicester. By 1956 Donald and MacVicar had built up considerable experience of using the machine and had scanned 250 patients. For most of that period, Donald and MacVicar had tried to differentiate why particular scans produced a particular image. They found that if there was fluid in the abdomen, e.g. an Ovarian cyst, there would be a clear gap in the image, until the ultrasound reached other side of the cyst. They then tried to distinguish between different ascites, by matching images to particular type of ascites. They also investigated the shape of image, in the presence of uterine fibroids. It was about that time that Edward Johnson Wayne of the Department of Medicine at the Western Infirmary had heard of Donald's research and was keen on a demonstration of the technique. Wayne would later be Regius Professor of the Practice of Medicine at Glasgow University. Wayne invited Donald to use his detector on a women who was dying from supposed stomach cancer. She was vomiting and losing weight rapidly and a barium x-ray had confirmed the diagnosis. Donald had agreed with the diagnosis of ascites and applied the probe. What amused them was while they could use the old and well understood technique of Abdominal palpation to differentiate masses, Donald was using machinery to achieve the same result. MacVicar not knowing the background of the case, commented, It looks like a cyst. Donald had to apologise to his colleagues as the diagnosis of a cyst was preposterous. After a meeting to discuss the case, it was agreed that a Laparotomy should be performed and Donald would do it. To his surprise, he discovered it was a pseudomucinous cyst that was filling the whole abdomen and was histologically benign. Donald and MacVicar was pleased with the results from the machine and continued to experiment in how it could be used for diagnosis but recognised that single dimension A-mode scanning was limited. The images produced by the device were still of poor quality and many still felt there was no future in the new machine. Donald learned of the work of Douglass Howry in the United States that an echo could only return to the probe and be recorded if the echo struck the reflecting surface at right angles, as the laws of optics required. At this point, Tom Brown came on the scene and offered to help. For Brown who was looking at the problem as an engineer in a clinical environment, he felt that the A-scope presentation was incompatible with the nature of the problem. Brown thought the image displayed did not correspond closely enough to the condition to enable a correct diagnosis. He believed that too much information was being returned in the image. The problem for him was that there was a myriad number of different echoes that were returned based on the sheer number of body structures. Even the patient breathing or moving on the table affected the image. Brown saw this as a problem and he planned to build a scanner that created an image that would be more useful for gynaecological diagnosis. They agreed to build a machine that used a rotating compound scanning search technique, rather like radar scanning a sector to increase the amount of echo information available. =Contact B-mode scanner= The solution proposed by Tom was to plot the position of the probe's echoes and create a two- dimensional picture. This type of device was known as a B-mode device. Unlike the A-mode device which used a single or double transducer and the function of depth to obtain a reading, the B-mode devices uses a linear array of transducers that simultaneously scans a plane through the body that can be viewed as a two-dimensional image on screen. Donald and Brown set out to create such a device. In 1956, to start the process of building the new scanner, Donald agreed to approach Kelvin and Hughes, now part of Smiths Industries and sent a letter to Ted Smith, a London-based salesman of the company. At the same time, Brown also approached deputy chairman Bill Slater who sent Brown to see Bill Halliday, the company's chief research scientist for an opinion on building the machine. After Brown delivered his spiel to Halliday it was several months before Brown received a reply in the form of a memo which stated that ¬£500 had been allocated by Smiths for the development and that Brown was able to spend half a day per week working with Donald. The new B-mode scanner was also known by the name Bed-Table Scanner and was built out of an amalgamation of medical and industrial parts. Brown managed to scrounge an older Mark IV flaw detector in Glasgow along with a 6-inch electrostatically-deflected Cathode-ray tube taken from the company stores in Glasgow. From the companies Barkingside R&D; department, Brown found an experimental weld-testing machine. Both these machines were cannibalised for parts. To measure the position of the transducer, Brown selected an 'X-Y' orthogonal measuring frame system. This was measured in place by a sine/cosine potentiometer that was used to calculate the position of the transducer from the angle of its rotations. This was an exceedingly expensive piece of electronic kit and cost more than their ¬£500 budget. However, Brown managed to scrounge a damaged component and repaired it. The machine was built on top an old hospital bed and made extensive use of Meccano chains and sprockets. By late 1957 the first contact B-mode scanner was constructed and in clinical use by that year. The A-mode scanner was moved to the Royal Maternity Hospital at Rottenrow where James Willocks, who joined the team in 1958 and Tom Duggan, a physicist who was hired by Donald himself in 1959, began to investigate fetal development with the instrument. The initial test of the device was ultrasound of John MacVicar's abdomen. In the same year, Donald started to experiment with taking images of pregnancy. They also found that their original theories about ascites were correct. In a landmark paper on 7 June 1958, published by Donald, McVicar and Brown discussed the development of the A-mode scanner and decisions that led up to the B-mode scanner. Donald and McVicar also described the first successful diagnosis using obstetric ultrasound with the B-mode machine. This occurred when a women patient was diagnosed with terminal cancer of the stomach using traditional clinical methods, palpation and by X-ray. Donald diagnosed the women with an Ovarian cyst and when the women was sent for a Laparotomy, a large cyst was discovered and removed, vindicating Donald's diagnosis. The paper highlighted the importance of the instant feedback that was available from the operating room to improve the quality of the image. In the paper Donald referenced the work of ultrasound pioneers, Douglass Howry in Denver, United States and Yoshimitsu Kikuchi in Japan in the early 1950s, alongside the work of John J. Wild and John M Reid. Also described in the paper was a description of testing of ultrasound on the brains of kittens to determine if there was any obvious changes in tissue structure. There was none. The team's enthusiasm in the success of the B-mode and the publication of the paper resulted in a change in attitudes in the medical community and more confirmed that medical diagnosis could be made. =Automatic scanner= In the period between 1958 and 1959 Donald became increasingly worried about scanning tissue deliberately to ensure he received sufficient detail, from fear of missing them. Donald along with MacVicar had been trying unsuccessfully to image hydatidiform moles, which involved increasing the amplification of the signal, which resulted in an increase in what Donald called electronic grass. He stated: :With high gain settings we were confronted with the danger of being deceived by 'electronic grass'. This danger now seemed so great that we decided to eliminate at least this error from over amplification and observer error by having an automatic scanner which would operate at a completely standardised speed In 1958, Brown and the engineers at Hughes started work on the new automatic scanner. The automatic scanner was built to standardize the compound scanning process and to remove, as far as possible, operator bias from the results. The probe was mounted in a steel ball that was connected to a column suspended from a gantry. In motion, it rocked to and fro. When it was 30¬∞ from the perpendicular to the skin, sensed by what Brown described as rather indelicate looking projections on either side of the ball, the motion was reversed and, simultaneously, the gantry supporting the column itself moved about 15mm, and the process was repeated. The scans could be done in the longitudinal plane, i.e. up or down the abdomen lengthways, rather than only across the width. The machine had to be capable of scanning all the different sizes and shapes of the female form. In addition, the scanner had to not only cope with the convex shape of a women's abdomen, but also with women who were perhaps ill or had some other form of pathology or were pregnant or very rotund. The way Brown designed this motion of maintaining contact with the body's surface was the use of another motor which would reposition the probe either up or down as required. This coupled with a pressure sensitive switch enabled the probe to stay in constant contact with the skin. Thus the machine had two motors, one for the vertical and one for the horizontal. However, the climbing of steep curves of heavier women presented its own problem. An elaborate control circuit was created that could switch between the two motors. The final part was the introduction of a joystick which enabled the initial position to be set on the body for the scan. This was the only automatic scanner built, in part due to funding problems and in part due to the complex nature of the machine, with continual tweaking needed to keep the valve electronics working. In December 1959, Donald meet with William Slater at the Kelvin Hughes factory and the Slater expressed a desire to pull out of the development of the new automatic scanner due to the increasing and what they saw as out of control costs. The original ¬£500 allocated to the project has stretched into thousands of pounds and they could no longer afford it. The running costs for the project were being met by the Scottish Endowments Hospital Trust but did not provide funding capital expenditure. Donald consulted with Hector Hetherington, who immediately produced ¬£750 pounds as a temporary measure while other funds were sought. Donald then approached the Scottish Hospital Endowments Research Trust and the Department of Health for Scotland. Slater and Donald attended a lunch party with the trust who provided a grant of ¬£4000 pounds. The Trust asked to seek help at the National Research Development Corporation in London who provided them an immediate grant of ¬£4000 that was later supplemented with additional funding up to a level of ¬£10000 over several years. The financial security was to last until 1965. For much of this period, Donald used his position as Regius Professor and his personal charisma and presence to sell the machine, or more accurately the potential of the ultrasound machine. The very idea of ultrasound and its benefits had to be disseminated to the medical community. In 1959, a Swedish obstetrician Bertil Sund√©n of Lund University, Sweden visited Glasgow on a quest to find a subject for his MD thesis. Glasgow University had established links with Lund University since the time of John Martin Munro Kerr. Lars Leksell of Lund has been experimenting with Ultrasound since the 1950s and had been using a Kelvin and Hughes supersonic detector to experiment with. Leksell's work had been well known to obstetrics and gynaecology professor Alf Sj√∂vall, who was friends with Donald and more importantly, knew his work. It was Sj√∂vall who decided to send Sund√©n to Glasgow. The outcome of the visit was that Sund√©n wanted to reproduce Donald's work from scratch. Despite the fact that the automatic scanner was almost completed, Sund√©n wanted an exact copy of the machine which Donald had used to produce his first publications, i.e. bed table scanner. The result was an order for a new ultrasound machine costing ¬£2500. This was the first direct- contact scanning machine built anywhere in the world and was a hybrid between the manually operated bed-table machine and the automatic scanner. This was a new prototype and became the basis for the Diasonograph that became the first commercially produced machine in 1965. Donald at around this time embarked on a series of lectures in the US. In 1960 Donald, MacVicar, and Brown demonstrated their scanner at a medical exhibition in Olympia, London, England. During this period Donald and his team scanned many hundreds of patients who were both pregnant and non-pregnant. Donald found that fetal echoes were visible for an early stage and this led to the distinction between a case of threatened abortion with bleeding and a case with a hydatidiform mole also with bleeding. The image showed a curious speckled picture, whereas the fetus produced strong echoes floating in space containing liquor. Very quickly Donald was swamped for requests for differential diagnosis, so the work was eventually moved to the X-ray department. At the same time Donald started to notice the very sharp echoes that were being produced at the sides of a babies head and this led to the use of a hand-held probe and the A-mode scanner to detect the presentation of the fetus. Donald's ward sister at Rottenrow, Marjory Marr rapidly made use of the technique to test doubtful cases in her antenatal ward, and was able to tell Donald in advance during his Friday morning obstetric rounds where the fetus lay. This led Donald to think about measuring the distance between the echoes as an index of the head or more specifically measuring the Biparietal diameter. Experiments proved the idea as being feasible. The medical physicist Tom Duggan who was working with Donald, created a ranging unit in which the distance between echoes could be calculated in centimetres and millimetres. James Willocks, a physician who worked with Donald in the same department at Rottenrow, undertook many hundreds of experiments using the new technique resulting in errors of less than 2% over 75% of cases. The use of serial measurements of the fetal head was the first study to use ultrasound to measure fetal growth anywhere in the world. Donald presented the results of the experiments at a meeting of the Royal Society of Medicine on 12 January 1962. By 1970, Donald was able to image fetal development during pregnancy using the Diasonograph, which led to new criteria to diagnose pregnancy failure, that resulted in his techniques being widely adopted as standard clinical practice in the 1970s. Queen Mother's Maternity Hospital The idea of a new maternity hospital had been on Donald's mind when he was interviewed for his position as professor when he was asked what plans he had, should he be appointed. He was in charge of a maternity unit at the Glasgow Royal Maternity and Women's Hospital, that was colloquially known as Rottenrow, that was already very old and unfit for purpose. Donald's first objective was to obtain the money to build the hospital. He harried the Scottish Office relentlessly until he received funding but it was insufficient to build the whole hospital. A sum of ¬£800,000 was needed. Donald then turned to Glasgow University to request the final block of funding and it was through the help of Hetherington that this was secured. The power that Glasgow University held in the planning process was illustrated when the Western Regional Hospital Board decided to build the hospital in the grounds of the old Robroyston hospital in the north-east of Glasgow. In a planning meeting when it was announced, Hetherington quietly stood up and stated: You must excuse me, gentleman, for you must know that if the proposal goes ahead the university can have no further interest in the project. Good afternoon. This shocked the planning board who realised the vast sum of money that was being taken away with the university principal, so they reversed their position and agreed to build the hospital in Yorkhill, next to the Royal Hospital for Children. In early 1958, Donald appointed the architect JL Gleave and together they produced a new design for a 112-bed maternity hospital that provided many new innovations. Traditionally maternity hospitals had consisted of two wards, antenatal and postnatal. Antenatal wards were for undelivered patients, postnatal for patients who were recovering from delivery. Wards were communal with privacy guaranteed by curtains. Generally deliveries would take place in the labour ward and only complicated deliveries or Caesarean sections were taken to the operating theatre. Donald's plan was for a hospital with a central block with four wings. The central block had separate nursing, medical and anaesthetist staff and a separate delivery room for each women and two operating rooms for complicated cases. The east wing had a separate room for each women and was reserved for complicated cases. The other wings were shared among senior consultants with their own junior staff in small four and six bed wards. Antenatal and postnatal women were mixed. At the end of the hospital was the university department and tower block for residents and nursing staff. Construction began in June 1960 and Donald by some contrivance managed to appoint his ward sister in Rottenrow, Miss Marjory Marr to be the Master of Works who would report the progress of works to Donald each day. The name of the new hospital was chosen by Donald who was a great admirer of Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother. The hospital was the first of its kind to have a separate ultrasound examination room. In 1961 Donald wrote a detailed article for the Scottish Medical Journal for a series on hospital planning, in which he described the acute need for new maternity beds in Glasgow, the design of the new hospital, why the Yorkhill site was chosen and why he believed that the increasing and rapid pace of medical research would make the new hospital obsolete within 25 years. The new hospital opened on 11 January 1964, with the first baby being born there on 12 January 1964. The hospital finally closed on 13 January 2010. Slightly longer than the 25 years envisioned by Donald. Health For much of his life, Donald suffered from valvular heart disease, that was a result of him and his sister Margaret becoming infected with Rheumatic fever when he was young. His sister had died from a mitral valve replacement surgery that was still in the early stages of development. In the Autumn of 1961, Donald collapsed in New York with atrial fibrillation. He decided to travel back to the Western Infirmary for treatment with a mitral valve replacement. The condition meant that he suffered many debilitating illnesses, attacks and conditions like pressure sores, blot clots and hematomas that led to further cardiac deterioration, necessitating a new operation. Over a period of four years, Donald underwent three major heart operations at Hammersmith Hospital. For the third operation, a mitral valve replacement from a pig, with a homograft that had lasted since 1969 was replaced with a Starr Edwards artificial valve in 1976. Donald had published personal accounts of his second and third cardiac operations.

She worked as an EU translator in Brussels for a time, but left to return to Denmark. Thiesen worked with KIT for a number of years before becoming its director. KIT has had a pioneering role in bringing a wide range of performers to Denmark; it is considered a cultural festival with global influences as much as it is a theatre. Thiesen edited a book of essays and reviews on KIT, published in Danish as FOOLS 25 : 25 √•rs teater, dans og performance med K√∏benhavns Internationale Teater (English: Fools 25: 25 years of theatre, dance and performance with the Copenhagen International Theatre). The book includes photographs of some performers, among them innovative dance companies, 'extreme' circuses such as Archaos, musicians, theatre companies, etc. Thiesen took a particular interest in finding circus acts from around the world, some of which placed unusual demands on her as a director; at one point she found herself in sole charge of a team of circus horses which turned up at the Copenhagen railway station without their handler. Thiesen improvised by placing them, with the consent of the Queen, in the royal stables. She later headed a cultural programme in which the Nordic governments set up cultural exchanges with African performance groups, particularly in Johannesburg and its Soweto community. The Nordic Council of Ministers' programme ran for a two-year period in 1998 and 1999, and encompassed more than 50 exchange projects in dance, theatre, music, literature and photography.

Along with the prong-billed barbet, it forms the family Semnornithidae, and is closely related to the toucans. It is a medium-sized barbet with a robust yellow bill. It has striking plumage, having a black head with grey throat and nape, red breast and upper belly, yellow lower belly and grey wings and tail. The toucan barbet is native to humid montane forests, where it occupies all levels of the canopy and is found in both primary and secondary forests, as well as forest edges. It is social, living in small family groups which work together to defend their territories and raise the chicks communally. It feeds on fruit and a range of animal prey, with insects being an important part of the diet of chicks. It sometimes joins mixed- species feeding flocks. Chicks are raised in cavities dug into large, usually dead trees. Young toucan barbets are preyed upon by plate-billed mountain toucans. The species is considered to be near threatened, mainly due to trapping for the cage-bird trade. It has also declined due to habitat loss, particularly the loss of large trees in which to breed, although the species is adaptable if left unmolested. Taxonomy and systematics The toucan barbet was described by the Scottish naturalist William Jardine, who placed it in the new genus Tetragonops. The specific name, ramphastinus, is modern Latin for toucan-like, based on Linnaeus' genus Ramphastos (1758). In 1899, Charles Richmond of the United States National Museum discovered that the genus name was preoccupied (meaning it had been used earlier for another genus) and placed the toucan barbet and its sister species the prong-billed barbet (Semnornis frantzii) in a new genus Pan, after the ancient god of the forest. The following year, Richmond issued a correction, as the name he had chosen was itself preoccupied (by the chimpanzees) and erected a new genus Semnornis for the two species. Historically, the toucan barbet was placed with the other barbets in the large family Capitonidae. This family included African and Asian representatives. DNA studies published in 1994 and 1999 and an examination of the morphology of the family in 1988 found that this arrangement was paraphyletic, as the New World barbets are more closely related to the toucans (family Ramphastidae) than they are to the Old World barbets. In particular, a close phylogenetic relationship between the genus Semnornis (which contains the toucan barbet) and toucans was found. The two lineages were more closely related to each other than even Semnornis and the other New World barbets. This led to a breakup of the barbet family, and the separate lineages are now considered to be distinct families; the toucan barbet is, together with the prong-billed barbet, now placed into the family Semnornithidae. An alternative arrangement is to combine all the barbets and the toucans into a single family, which due to priority would be the toucan family Ramphastidae. The two described subspecies are the nominate race, found in Ecuador, and the subspecies S. r. caucae from Columbia. S. r. caucae, named for Cauca in Columbia, was described in 1941 by Swedish ornithologist and explorer Nils Gyldenstolpe. Description The toucan barbet has a robust bill. The toucan barbet is a medium-sized robust barbet, of long and weighing . The beak is robust with a yellow maxilla and a light green mandible, both with dark ends. It is pronged at the end, though the prongs are not noticeable in the field. The plumage is colourful and includes a black crown, \\"mask\\", and thin cervical collar. The species has long occipital feathers and a conspicuous white stripe behind the eyes, which has a bright red-colored iris. The nape of the neck is golden-brown and becomes yellow towards the rump. The throat, upper breast, and sides of the nape are grayish-blue. The lower breast and middle belly are bright red, while the lower belly is yellowish green. The wings and tail are grey. The subspecies S. r. caucae is very similar to the nominate race, but has less extensive red on the breast. Both sexes are almost identical except for the female's plumage being slightly less bright, and the female lacks the tuft on the black plumage of the nape. Immature birds are duller than adults, and do not develop prongs until they are 4 months old. Habitat and distribution Cloud forest in Ecuador The species is native to the humid forests of the western Andes, from the Andean slopes of northwest Ecuador to southwest Colombia, at altitudes of . It uses all forest strata, showing some preference for the upper canopy of the forest () and the subcanopy (). The species also uses secondary forest and forest-edge habitats. Evidence suggests that these birds are very specific in choosing trees for nesting. It usually prefers old trees in the family Lauraceae. As nesting trees of sufficient diameter are not very common in these forests, habitat loss through logging is impacting the species. Behavior and ecology The toucan barbet is usually found in pairs or small groups perched silently on long horizontal branches, making them hard to find unless active or singing. The flight is characterized by being hurried and noisy. It usually lives in small groups of three to six individuals. The species is territorial, with territories ranging between , with an average of . Most of the territory consists of mature forest, although the species can adapt to live in forests with small areas of secondary forest or pastures. Toucan barbet groups show a marked territorial behavior towards other groups or species, which is usually made clear by the loud duets of breeding pairs, and it is actively protected by the breeding pair by chasing of intruders. The family group's helpers assist in this, especially near the nest. In the absence of interference, these groups can occupy a particular territory for a year or longer. Calls and displays Toucan barbet calls are unmistakable, composed of loud shrieks that travel long distances. It is usually sung in duet by the breeding pair, simultaneously or in syncope by both sexes during the breeding season, usually for territorial display. The frequency of calls changes with each season, being more common at the beginning of the year and declining in frequency after April. The toucan barbet can also produce clicking sounds. When nests are threatened by predators or competitor species that might steal the nesting site, members of the group make a rattling call followed by pecking and knocking wood to drive the competitor or predator away. If this fails, the group will begin to mob the intruder. Mobbing behavior is more common if a group is involved as opposed to just a pair. Feeding Toucan barbet feeding in Ecuador The species is frugivorous, feeding on a variety of fruits mixed with other foods. A comparison of the diets of the New World barbets found they were more frugivorous than the other barbets, and their diets were more similar to those of toucans. 62 different species of fruit from 20 families have been reported as being eaten; fruits of Cecropia trees have been shown to be especially important as food sources, as well as Clusia. Other food taken includes insects such as termites, small reptiles, nectar, tree sap, and flower petals. The exact composition of the diet varies by season, with insects being more commonly taken in April. The diet of nestlings has more insect prey than that of adults, with 54% being fruit and 42% being insects. The toucan barbet forages for 12 hours of the day around its territory, foraging from ground level to up into the canopy. It forages in small groups of up to six birds and sometimes forms mixed flocks with tyrant flycatchers, warblers, tanagers, and other frugivores. Breeding The toucan barbet is unusual among frugivorous birds in that it breeds cooperatively, with several helpers aiding the dominant breeding pair with incubation and raising the young. Groups are larger outside the reproductive season but generally shrink to three individuals in season, usually composed of previous immature offspring that stay with their parents and help with the new hatchlings. After the breeding season, the group increases due to greater acceptance of non-family members. These helpers significantly increase the reproductive success of the breeding pair. The breeding season of the toucan barbet is from February through to October. Pairs may have two or even three broods per year. The toucan barbet carves out holes in tree trunks with its powerful beak, in which it roosts and nests. The nesting holes are usually dug into dead trees, usually snags with broken trunks, or more rarely in a dead branch in a living tree. Both sexes incubated the eggs; in nesting sites without helpers, males took more of the incubation and brooding duties than females. The incubation period lasts 15 days, and the hatchlings fledge after 45 days. Juveniles look very much like adults, but have paler colors and black irises. Juveniles' plumage is kept for at least 2 months after fledging. Predators and parasites Plate-billed mountain toucans are nest predators of toucan barbets. The toucan barbet competes with plate-billed mountain toucans for nesting sites, and that species also preys on young toucan barbets in the nest. White-faced capuchins and Neotropical dwarf squirrels are also treated as threats to nesting sites by family groups. Little is known of its parasites, but feather mites of the genera Picalgoides and Ramphastobius (specifically Ramphastobius callinoticus) have been found on them. Conservation The species is classified as near threatened by the IUCN. Though still fairly common locally, its populations have decreased due to habitat loss, accelerated by massive logging operations, deforestation, cattle grazing, and mining. Illegal trapping for the local and international cage- bird trade is considered to be the main threat to this species, as it is adaptable and can tolerate some habitat modification if left unmolested. Heavy trapping pressure and habitat fragmentation due to forest clearing are thought to be responsible for some localised extinctions of this species.

As the dunes are a nesting area for sensitive species, public access is limited to the paths and trails. History The Fort Ord Dunes State Park encompasses coastal areas of the closed Fort Ord, a United States Army installation. The area once held 15 rifle ranges for the installation. After undergoing restoration work the landmark became a state park in 2009. The land was transferred as a public benefit conveyance to the State by the National Park Service through the Federal Lands to Parks Program. The conveyance, at no cost to the State, requires that the land be used only for public park and recreation area purposes in perpetuity, with the federal government retaining a reversionary interest if the terms of the deed are not met.Conveyance of federal surplus property for public park purposes is authorized by the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended, esp. by the Federal Lands for Parks and Recreation Act of 1969; P.L.91-485; 40 U.S.C. ¬ß550(e).

An important element in his adaptation of Hindu religiosity was the introduction of his four yogas model, which includes Raja yoga, his interpretation of Patanjali's Yoga sutras, which offers a practical means to realize the divine force within, which is central to modern Western esotericism. The other three yogas are the classical Karma Yoga (Karma Yoga), Bhakti Yoga, and Jnana Yoga (Jnana Yoga). Vivekananda's interpretation of Patanjali's Yoga Sutras is mostly based on the part on astanga yoga, the eight limbs of yoga described in the Sadhana Pada or practice part. According to De Michelis, Vivekananda's ideas on Raja Yoga mainly consists of two different models, with sometimes a third \\"mode of thought\\": # The Prana Model, which is mostly applied in the first part, is strongly influenced by the mesmeric beliefs which were popular at that time, and also contains Hatha-yoga teachings. It gives a prominent place to prana as the central life force, which can be controlled by Raja Yoga. The accumulation of prana leads to liberation, and furthers \\"speed[s] up the adepts on their evolutionary path towards the ultimate goal.\\" # The Samadhi Model, which focuses on the power of mind, is strongly influenced by transcendentalism, New Thought, and William James's functional psychology. Yoga is presented here as a journey of the mind back to its origins by means of meditative practice. According to Vivekananda, \\"each individual mind is part of the 'universal mind'\\" which can be rejoined by attaining samadhi. # A third mode of thought, called \\"Neo-Advaitic\\" by De Michelis, is otherworldly oriented. It insists on leaving behind \\"all powers and attainments\\" to reach an \\"altogether transcendent state.\\" This state is reached in the last stage of samadhi, and is equal to the identification with the purusa, or \\"the One or Emerson's Oversoul c.q.

It was the only historically black college among the ten colleges and universities in the Concordia University System. The college ceased operations at the completion of the spring 2018 semester, citing years of financial distress and declining enrollment. History In 1919, African-American Lutheran congregations in Alabama petitioned the Evangelical Lutheran Synodical Conference of North America for funds to open a high school and college to train church workers. The school opened in 1922 in a rented cottage, and the Synodical Conference soon purchased in northeast Selma, Alabama as the site of the Alabama Luther College. A recitation hall (now named Bakke Hall) and a dormitory were erected at a cost of $36,000 and opened in 1925. The college was forced to close during the Great Depression and the remaining high school was renamed the Alabama Lutheran Academy. Eventually the college was reopened, resulting in the name Alabama Lutheran Academy and College. In 1981 the name was changed to Concordia College Alabama, and in 1994 it gained accreditation from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools as a bachelor's degree-granting institution. In February 2018, the college announced that it would close at the conclusion of its academic year due to enduring financial problems. The 147 members of the final graduating class received their diplomas on April 28, 2018. On January 3, 2019, Dr. Paul J. Kim, a Korean minister, signed paperwork to purchase the campus. He plans to open a \\"mission retreat center\\", similar to Yoido Full Gospel Church's Prayer Mountain Korea. He also intends to establish a \\"contemporary music university\\" over the next two years. Campus Concordia College's Bakke Hall and the Dormitory, completed in 1928, were both added to the Alabama Register of Landmarks and Heritage on June 19, 1997. In 2010 Concordia increased the size of its campus from to by acquiring the grounds and buildings of the adjacent United Methodist Children‚Äôs Home. Academic profile The college had 445 students during the fall 2017 term. Student life Athletics The Concordia College sports teams, collectively known as the Hornets, competed in the United States Collegiate Athletic Association (USCAA). Men's sports included basketball, soccer, and baseball, while women's sports included softball, track, soccer, golf and volleyball.

History Cruquius gets its name from Nicolaas Kruik (1678‚Äì1754), a Dutch land-surveyor and one of many promoters of a plan to pump the Haarlemmermeer (Haarlem lake) dry. Like many well-educated men of his time, he latinized his name to Nicolaas Samuel Cruquius. During his lifetime the issue of the Haarlem Lake and how to pump it dry was international news, as the following excerpt from the Virginia Gazette on May 31, 1751 illustrates:Virginia Gazette, Hunter, September 26, 1751, page 3 , facsimile on research.history.org > \\"By a private letter from Rotterdam, we are told, that the Dutch Engineers, > in their Plan for draining the lake of Haerlem, proposed to employ 150 mills > for three Years, and had computed the Expense at a Million and Half of > Florins, but that a German, who had been long employed in the Mines of > Hungary and Hartz, had proposed to drain it with 50 machines, in 15 months, > at a far less Expense; and that he has been ordered to erect one of those > Machines, which, if it shall be found to execute what he has asserted, his > Proposal will be immediately accepted.\\" Even 50 machines proved too expensive, so it wasn't until successful experiments with steam pumping stations, such as at nearby Groenendaal park in 1781, that serious plans resulted in three steam driven pumping stations, including the one at Cruquius. As a tribute to former planners, the pumping stations of the Haarlemmermeer were named after them. The one at the mouth of the Spaarne river, near Heemstede, was called Cruquius. To service the mill, the workers who lived there founded the village of the same name. The dike was built in the 1840s, the pump started work in 1850 and in the three years that had been predicted a century before, the Haarlem lake was pumped dry. The pumping station Cruquius continued to work on and off until 1933, when it was made into a museum. The foreman's house was made into a caf√© which it still is today.

Before the Folsom powerhouse was built nearly all electric power houses were using direct current (DC) generators powered by steam engines located within a very few miles of where the power was needed. The use of rushing water to generate hydroelectric power and then transmitting it long distances to where it could be used was not initially economically feasible as long as the electricity generated was low-voltage direct current. Once it was invented, AC power made it feasible to convert the electrical power to high voltage by using the newly invented transformers and to then economically transmit the power long distances to where it was needed. Lower voltage electrical power, which is much easier and safer to use, could be easily gotten by using transformers to convert the high voltage power to lower voltages near where it was being used. DC power cannot use a transformer to change its voltage. The Folsom Powerhouse, using part of the American River's rushing water to power its turbines connected to newly invented AC generators, generated three phase 60 cycle AC electricity (the same that's used today in the United States) that was boosted by newly invented transformers from 800 volts as generated to 11,000 volts and transmitted to Sacramento over a 22 mi (35 km)-long distribution line, one of the longest electrical distribution lines in the United States at the time.  Introduction In Sacramento the 11,000 volts AC power was transformed down to a lower voltage near where it was needed for use. The Folsom Powerhouse was one of the first examples of significant electrical power being generated and economically shipped to where it could be used. Hydroelectric power had been demonstrated as a viable source of economical power despite being located a significant distances from the users. The Folsom Powerhouse is located above Sacramento on the American River in the city of Folsom.  History  The power station remained in operation until 1952 when the original Folsom dam across the American River was destroyed to make way for the new much larger Folsom Dam. The powerhouse was shut down after 57 years of continuous operation. Pacific Gas and Electric, who bought the original hydroelectric plant in 1902, donated the plant and most of its equipment to the State of California when the new Folsom Dam and hydroelectric plant was built. The State of California designated the site as California Historical Landmark Number #633. The historic park was established in 1956. The powerhouse was designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1981. The two-story brick and granite Powerhouse looks much as it did in 1895. Its imposing generators, and the Tennessee marble-faced control switchboard stand as imposingly as they did more than a hundred years ago. Historic photos, interpretive exhibits and docent guided tours by the California State Park Service explain how the powerhouse worked. Some of the original water turbines, generators, etc. are still in place.Pictorial tour of Folsom Power House accessed 11 Apr 2014Pictorial tour of Folsom Power House continued accessed 11 Apr 2014 Before AC electric generators and the newly invented transformers were invented only DC electrical generators could be used to generate electrical power and they were restricted by their low voltage requirements to economically transmitting power for only a few miles. Too much power was lost in transmission at low voltage for long distance power transmission to be practical. This meant the original power stations were restricted (at that time) to local steam generating plants built right in each local neighborhood. Pearl Street Station was the first central power plant in the United States. It was located at 255-257 Pearl Street in downtown Manhattan on a site measuring 50 by 100 feet (15 by 30 m), just south of Fulton Street. It began with one direct current generator powered by a coal burning steam engine, and it started generating electricity on September 4, 1882, serving an initial load of 400 incandescent lamps used by 85 customers located within about of the station. However, with the advent of AC, there came the use of transformers to convert the generated power to a much higher voltage for transmission allowed the power plants and users to be separated by hundreds of miles if needed. The high voltage could then use transformers to obtain lower voltages for final use. Single point failures were minimized in the plant design. The AC generators and their associated water turbines were so large that they could not be shipped by rail and were shipped around Cape Horn by ship. Only two of the four alternating current generators were operating on July 13, 1895 when the powerhouse provided the first electricity to Sacramento via of transmission lines, making it one of the first places in the United States to transmit long-distance hydroelectric power.Edison Tech Center description of Folsom Powerplant accessed 21 May 2014 The Folsom power plant predates Niagara Falls Adams power House generating AC electrical transmission for local use and shipment to Buffalo, New York in 1897.George Westinghouse and Nikola Tesla designed Niagara power station accessed 11 Apr 2014 The International Electro-Technical Exhibition - 1891 in Frankfurt am Main Germany demonstrated an earlier instance of long distance AC transmission of hydroelectric power. Westinghouse Electric Company and General Electric were in a race to develop better equipment and bring it to the United States. Water supply Old Folsom Dam Region near Folsom Prison below Existing Dam The water for the original Folsom hydroelectric plant was obtained from a diversion dam, long, wide at the top; wide at the bottom and tall, across the American River built in the 1890s. The dam diverted a large stream of water into a long diversion canal‚Äîthe East Canal. This canal was wide and deep, carrying about of water per minute. The canal paralleled the river but sloped much less steeply gradually getting about above the river. The dam and canal were completed in 1893 under the direction of Horatio Gates Livermore who originally thought to use the power of the falling water to power a sawmill. Livermore utilized in part contracted prison labor from the nearby Folsom State Prison to help build the dam and canal. The geometry of the canal forebay and the American River gave the Folsom power plant a Hydraulic head of water of about (about was usable) before its water was discharged back into the American River. Initially only about of this hydraulic head was used. The water from the canal ended in a forebay where water borne debris was separated from the water and it was fed into four large penstocks and two smaller penstocks. All penstocks had water gates that could be closed to turn the water off on any turbine for maintenance. The AC generators, some of the largest designed and built up to that time, were powered via four penstocks full of rushing water driving four large turbines.  Turbines  The four large water turbines, some of the largest built up to that time, were made by S. Morgan Smith Works of York, Pennsylvania. There were two small penstocks plus turbines for the two DC generators. Rushing water from the American River passing through four large water turbines powered the four AC generators and two more turbines powered smaller DC generators. Folsom Upper House Main Turbine.JPG  Governors  The four large turbines were connected directly to the alternating current generators and their speed controlled by adjusting the water flow, with a centrifugal governor, to obtain 300 shaft rpm‚Äîneeded to generate a steady 60 cycle current.

The four alternating current generators are some of the most powerful rotating armature 3-phase machines ever built. Newly invented by Elihu Thomson, they weighed almost 30 tons each (57,887 pounds) and were . These original AC generators used many DC generator components in their first design. The 750-kilowatt (1,005 horsepower) alternating current generators were made in the newly incorporated General Electric plant in Schenectady, New York. The alternators had rotating armatures with 216 radial 4 inch slots formed into the perimeter. Each slot holds two insulated 3 1/2 foot rectangular inductive bars of related phase, an inner circle of 216 bars and an outside circle of 216 bars. The induction bars are twice bent into offsets in the same direction. The middle of the bar has a straight section 3 feet long, to get from the front of the rotor to the back. The inner circle of bars is connected to the outer circle by small conductive jumper blocks on the front and back of the rotor. The rotor's three phases are connected to six branch circuits. Each of the six branch circuits make their way three times progressively around the rotor in right hand flattened spirals. Supplying power for the 24 stator (non-rotating) field coil magnets on the AC generators was a small direct current generator with another DC generator in standby mode for immediate substitution if needed. If one DC generator failed or needed maintenance the other one could be used. All four AC generators power were connected to each other, when long-term demand increased and it was found that tying generators together improved frequency control, by synchronizing action. Switch panel To allow customers to use electric clocks regulated by synchronous motors, a Frequency \\"Indicator\\" was added to the Powerhouse switchboard. File:Alternator Frequency Meter.JPGFolsom Powerhouse Frequency Indicator To allow parallel alternators and power grid, a Synchroscope was added to the Switch Panel. File:Folsom Synchroscope.JPGFolsom Synchroscope Transmission lines 11 kV transformers, oil and water cooled The AC power generated (about 4,020 horse power or 3 MW) at the Folsom hydroelectric facility was converted to 11,000 volts at the power plant by twelve new (in 1895) air cooled transformers invented by William Stanley, Jr. and transmitted to Sacramento on twelve bare #1 AVG copper wires held by ceramic insulators that were attached to the cross beams mounted on two sets of cedar poles. The multiple wires allowed four independent three phase lines to be used. This allowed for repairs, maintenance and new installations without shutting the whole system down. The poles were planted about apart to string the power lines. Telephone lines were run beneath the power lines. Once in Sacramento the high voltage power was shipped near where it was going to be used and transformed down to a lower voltage for use‚Äîthe same as electrical power is shipped and used today. By 1895 almost 900 electric street railways and nearly 11,000 miles (18,000 km) of track had been built in the United States and they were then one of the main users of electrical energy. Direct current electric motors, as used on electrical streetcars, were restricted in use to being only a few miles from the DC generators. DC power, despite its restrictions, had become very useful.The Electrical Engineer: A Weekly Review of Theoretical Electrical...1895, Volume 20 accessed 22 Mar 2014 A rotary converter, a type of motor generator, was used to convert alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC) for railway electrification from an AC power source. Factories were also heavy power users. Transforming AC voltages up to high voltages for long distance transmission and down to lower voltages at locations close to their use was a very attractive way to get access to a new source of power. Improvements in transformer design allowed the original air cooled transformers at the Folsom powerhouse to be replaced in 1900 with more efficient oil cooled transformers. The alternating current electric induction motor was independently introduced in 1888 by Galileo Ferraris and Nikola Tesla, by 1895 was beginning to allow electrical power to replace steam as a power source. The induction motor allowed alternating current to be used directly without any conversions. The first heavy AC motor users were various factories which typically replaced their steam power plants. Alternating current electrical power and its easy conversion with transformers from low to high voltage and back to low voltage made possible the widespread electrical grids we routinely use today for a myriad of tasks. On September 9, 1895, the new power provided by the powerhouse was celebrated in a \\"Grand Electric Carnival\\" decorating the Sacramento state capital with thousands of light bulbs to celebrate the 45th anniversary of California statehood. Lower powerhouse A second powerhouse was constructed below the original facility in 1897 to house an additional 750-kilowatt AC generator to meet the growing residential and public transit electricity demands of Sacramento. This generator was separated from the turbine turning it by about a rope belt pulley system. As new uses and users for electricity increased, by the early 1900s the demand for electricity in Sacramento and its adjacent cities had out-paced the capacity of the expanded Folsom Powerhouse. Larger hydroelectric plants and dams were built along the Yuba, Feather, and Tuolumne Rivers in order to provide power for Northern California. The San Francisco-based California Gas and Electric Company bought the Folsom Powerhouse by 1902. When the company was reorganized into the Pacific Gas and Electric Company in 1906, it retooled the powerhouse and forebay.

This contrasts with systems used primarily for tracking or gun laying, which tend to offer shorter ranges but offer much higher accuracy. EW radars tend to share a number of design features that improve their performance in the role. For instance, EW radar typically operates at lower frequencies, and thus longer wavelengths, than other types. This greatly reduces their interaction with rain and snow in the air, and therefore improves their performance in the long-range role where their coverage area will often include precipitation. This also has the side- effect of lowering their optical resolution, but this is not important in this role. Likewise, EW radars often use much lower pulse repetition frequency to maximize their range, at the cost of signal strength, and offset this with long pulse widths, which increases the signal at the cost of lowering range resolution. The canonical EW radar is the British Chain Home system, which entered full-time service in 1938. It used a very low pulse repetition of 25 pps and very powerful transmissions (for the era) reaching 1 MW in late-war upgrades. The German Freya and US CXAM (Navy) and SCR-270 (Army) were similar. Post-war models moved to the microwave range in ever-increasingly powerful models that reached the 50 MW range by the 1960s. Since then, improvements in receiver electronics has greatly reduced the amount of signal needed to produce an accurate image, and modern examples the transmitted power is much less; the AN/FPS-117 offers range from 25 kW. EW radars are also highly susceptible to radar jamming and often include advanced frequency hopping systems to reduce this problem. History The first early-warning radars were the British Chain Home, the German Freya, the US CXAM (Navy) and SCR-270 (Army), and the Soviet Union . By modern standards these were quite short range, typically about . This \\"short\\" distance is a side effect of radio propagation at the long wavelengths being used at the time, which were generally limited to line-of-sight. Although techniques for long-range propagation were known and widely used for shortwave radio, the ability to process the complex return signal was simply not possible at the time. Cold War To counter the threat of Soviet bombers flying over the Arctic, the U.S. and Canada developed the DEW Line. Other examples (Pinetree Line) have since been built with even better performance. An alternative early warning design was the Mid-Canada Line, which provided \\"line breaking\\" indication across the middle of Canada, with no provision to identify the target's exact location or direction of travel. Starting in the 1950s, a number of over-the- horizon radars were developed that greatly extended detection ranges, generally by bouncing the signal off the ionosphere. Modern day Today the early warning role has been supplanted to a large degree by airborne early warning platforms. By placing the radar on an aircraft, the line-of-sight to the horizon is greatly extended. This allows the radar to use high-frequency signals, offering high resolution, while still offering long range. A major exception to this rule are radars intended to warn of ballistic missile attacks, like BMEWS, as the high-altitude exo-atmospheric trajectory of these weapons allows them to be seen at great ranges even from ground-based radars.

It is accessible only by water. Franks Tract, and a smaller adjoining submerged property called \\"Little Franks Tract\\", are situated between the False River and Bethel Island. The recreation area is used primarily for fishing and waterfowl hunting, because of its exposure to frequent strong winds and fluctuating water levels. In times of high water, the entire site can be submerged except for portions of the old levees. The park was established in 1959. It is managed from nearby Brannan Island State Recreation Area, to the northwest. History Franks Tract was once the United States' second-largest source of peat, after the Everglades. Located along the San Joaquin River, about east of Antioch, California, the site was originally reclaimed between 1902 and 1906 and owned by Dr. N.K. Foster and F.C. Franks. It was then used for growing potatoes, beans, asparagus, sugar beets, onions, seed crops, small grains and corn. Fred C. Franks and his wife deeded a half interest of Division D to John Markley and his wife Ada R. on March 29, 1913. In February 1937, Franks Tract was inundated, but was reclaimed by October. However, in February 1938 the False River levee broke and Franks Tract was flooded and never reclaimed. The Regents of the University of California, Berkeley owned Division D, containing 502.25 acres, according to a November 23, 1943 property map. The Little Franks Tract was last flooded in 1982, and no attempt was ever made to restore it as farmland. The United States Navy used a portion of the area as a bombing target known as Antioch Bombing Target from 1943 to 1952. Wildlife Because of the tract's location in the Pacific Flyway, a large variety of waterfowl inhabit it, especially during the fall and winter. Year round species include gulls, great blue herons, terns, swallows, crows, blackbirds, cormorants and kingfishers. Hunting on the open water is allowed, subject to California Fish & Wildlife Department (CDFWD) regulations. Permits and other arrangements must be made in advance through the Brannan Island State Recreation Area.\\"Franks Tract State Recreation Area.\\" California Department of Parks and Recreation. 2018. Accessed July 7, 2018. Franks Tract restoration project CDFWD plan and assessment The CDFWD has been studying ways to modify the Franks Tract to accomplish several objectives, namely: \\"...improve habitat for the Delta smelt, reduce saltwater intrusion into the central and south Delta, reduce submerged aquatic weeds and reduce invasive nonnative fish species that feed on native fish like the salmon and the Delta smelt.\\"Kukulich, Tony. \\"Franks Tract restoration moves forward.\\" The Press. July 3, 2018. Updated July 6, 2018. Accessed July 7, 2018. The study and report were completed by Moffatt & Nichol, a consulting firm retained by the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD). CDFWD presented its final draft of its project feasibility study at a meeting of the Delta Stewardship Council in Sacramento on June 29, 2018. The study concluded that \\"... the project is both feasible and expensive.\\" The plan is premised on splitting the Franks Tract with a berm that runs north and south, then filling the property west of the berm (including the Little Franks Tract) to create about of wetlands. The east side of the berm would face of open channel. This would permanently block access to False River and the Sacramento River from the Franks Tract and Bethel Island. The project's cost was estimated at $300 to $600 million. Local objections and concerns CDFWD released a draft of its report in March, 2018. Everyone who attended these meetings who returned comments objected to the plan. Some of these were: * The objective of removing all non-native species from the Delta included driving out black bass, which moved in during the 1938 flooding. This species has thrived in Franks Tract and has become a favorite attraction for fishermen. According to Jan McCleery, the president of the Save the California Delta Alliance, Bethel Island hosts bass fishing tournaments nearly every weekend during the summer, with each event reportedly generating $200,000 income for the community.Kukulich, Tony. \\"Franks Tract restoration project under fire.\\" The Press. March 18, 2018. Accessed July 7, 2018. * Access to \\"fast water\\" is a major factor affecting property values along the Delta. The proposal would eliminate this access for existing boat docks and marinas at Bethel Island, likely forcing them to rebuild elsewhere. It would also have a major impact on Discovery Bay, reducing values of existing homes there. Franks Tract Futures Project * Responding to broad stakeholder concerns raised during the feasibility study, CAFW has scrapped the initial design and restarted restoration planning for Franks Tract using a transparent and stakeholder driven process that seeks to incorporate a broad range stakeholder interests, including ecology, recreation, water quality, property values, public health and sustainable local economy.

The western half of the route is an important link between the Greater New Haven and the Greater Waterbury areas and is part of the state primary highway system. Route description Route 70 officially begins as a continuation of SSR 801', known locally as Waterbury Road and East Main Street, near its interchange with Interstate 84 (at Exit 26) in Cheshire. Route 70 proceeds southeast on Waterbury Road into the Mixville section of Cheshire, then meets Route 68 about east of the I-84 junction. Routes 68 and 70 become concurrent as they proceed east along West Main Street and Main Street into Cheshire center. After a brief (0.15 mi) three-way overlap with Route 10, Routes 68 and 70 continue eastward together as Academy Road for another . Route 68 then splits off to the east towards Wallingford while Route 70 heads northeast towards Meriden (as South Meriden Road). The Route 68/70 overlap is long. Route 70 enters the city of Meriden, where the road name changes to River Road. Route 70 follows River Road for about then turns onto Main Street. After crossing the Quinnipiac River, Route 70 turns southeast onto Hanover Avenue, ending after another at Route 71. Route 70 carries average traffic volumes of about 15,400 vehicles per day west of Route 10 and about 6,300 vehicles per day east of Route 10. History The route directly connecting downtown Waterbury and Cheshire center was first improved in 1852 by the Waterbury and Cheshire Plank Road Company, which had built the toll road. The company continued operating the toll road until 1880 when the company charter was repealed by the Connecticut General Assembly. In 1922, the Waterbury to Cheshire road was designated as a secondary state highway known as Highway 323. Highway 323 began at the intersection of Meriden Road and East Main Street and followed East Main Street towards Cheshire. In Cheshire, Highway 323 followed modern Route 70 until the junction with Highland Avenue (modern Route 10). In the 1932 state highway renumbering, modern Route 70 was created from old Highway 323 plus an extension east of Route 10 along a previously unnumbered road to the South Meriden section of the city of Meriden. The original eastern terminus was at Hanover Road (then Route 71) just after crossing the Quinnipiac River. The route was extended by 1955 along New Hanover Avenue to Old Colony Road (then US 5A). In 1962, Route 70 took over the former south end of Route 71 (Hanover Avenue) to its modern terminus at Old Colony Road (modern Route 71) after Route 71 was relocated to the former US 5A. In 1964, Route 70 was truncated in the west so that it now began at the I-84 Interchange 26 westbound onramp. The former Route 70 in Waterbury was redesignated as unsigned State Road 801.

It is on the Argyle Line. Train services are provided by Abellio ScotRail. Architecture and history The station was originally named Coatbridge and opened in 1842. It was renamed Coatbridge Central in 1953 after the 1826 Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway station named Coatbridge Central closed in 1951. It is on what was originally the Garnkirk and Glasgow Railway, which later became the Glasgow, Garnkirk and Coatbridge Railway. The connection southwards came courtesy of the Wishaw and Coltness Railway, with their first passenger train arriving from Morningside in May 1845. Both companies were taken over by the Caledonian Railway in 1849. A further route to the station, the Rutherglen and Coatbridge Railway from Glasgow via Rutherglen and , was opened in August 1866.Railscot Chronology - Rutherglen and Coatbridge Railway www.railbrit.co.uk; Retrieved 2013-12-24 The existing station layout is the result of a re-build by the Caledonian Railway in 1900, but the platform level buildings were demolished in the 1970s when the station was a likely candidate for closure due to dwindling patronage and services. Trains from Glasgow Buchanan Street over the original GG&CR; route had ceased in November 1962, whilst those over the R&CR; were withdrawn four years later due to the Beeching Axe, leaving only a skeleton service between and Stirling/Perth to call here. However, for much of the 1970s and early to mid 1980s this consisted of a pair of through long-distance expresses between London Euston and ‚Äîthe daytime Clansman (via Birmingham New Street) and overnight Royal Highlander sleeper‚Äîalong with a mid-morning to Motherwell passenger & parcels train and evening northbound return working that started back at .GB National Rail Timetable 1977 Edition, Table 65Railscot - 10.18 Perth to Motherwell calling at the station in 1981 www.railbrit.co.uk; Retrieved 2013-12-24 All of these workings had been either withdrawn or diverted by 1987, but by then Strathclyde PTE had introduced a regular local service from Motherwell as an extension of the Argyle Line's Hamilton Circle route (the line through here had been electrified by British Rail in 1981 to allow electrically hauled freight trains to access the nearby Gartsherrie container terminal). The link northwards to was re-established in 1996 when the Motherwell to Cumbernauld DMU service was inaugurated. That provided the main service from the station up until the May 2014 timetable change, as Argyle Line trains only called here at peak periods. Electrification was extended north to Cumbernauld in 2014 as part of the Edinburgh to Glasgow Improvement Programme upgrade scheme, and thereafter all passenger trains began to be worked by EMUs. Following a timetable recast in December 2014, Motherwell services once again run on through via the Hamilton Circle to the city's north west suburbs throughout the day. Access to the station is now by a ramp from West Canal Street leading to the Down (Cumbernauld bound) platform with access to the Motherwell-bound island platform via the original underpass. Original access to both platforms of the station was via this underpass from the category C(S) listed two-floor structure at the end of the station. The main building was disused for many years after the removal of staffing in the 1970s, but was renovated in the early 2000s and used initially as a public house and more recently as commercial premises for an office supplies company.Railscot - Coatbridge Central photo gallery With a container terminal just north of the station, and the location on link between the West Coast Main Line and the lines to Grangemouth, Stirling and points north, there are also freight trains passing through the station.

Selgin formerly taught at George Mason University, the University of Hong Kong, and West Virginia University. Research Selgin's research covers a broad range of topics within the field of monetary economics, including monetary history, macroeconomic theory, and the history of monetary thought. He is one of the founders, along with Kevin Dowd and Lawrence H. White, of the Modern Free Banking School, which draws its inspiration from the writings of Friedrich Hayek on denationalization of money and choice in currency. A central claim of the Free Banking School is that the effects of government intervention in monetary systems cannot be properly appreciated except with reference to a theory of monetary laissez-faire, analogous to the theory of free trade that informs the modern understanding of the effects of tariffs and other trade barriers. The free bankers argue that, viewed in light of such a theory, financial crises and business cycles are largely attributable to misguided government interference with freely-evolved and competitive monetary arrangements, including legislation granting central banks exclusive rights to issue paper currency.E.g., Selgin is also known for his advocacy of a \\"productivity norm\\" for monetary policy‚Äîan ideal according to which the growth-rate of nominal gross domestic product should be such as will allow the (output) price level to decline along with goods' real (unit) costs of production--that is, at a rate opposite the growth rate of total factor productivity. According to Selgin, by preventing mild deflation in response to productivity gains, monetary authorities risk inadvertently fueling unsustainable booms or economic bubbles, setting the stage for consequent busts and recession. Because it requires that aggregate spending grow at a steady rate equal to the trend growth rate of weighted factor input growth, Selgin's ideal amounts to a version of nominal income targeting, which helped to inspire and inform the post-Great Recession movement favoring NGDP targeting. Selgin is considered a Bitcoin OG (\\"Original Gangsta\\"), having taken part in the original cypherpunk mailing list (with Wei Dei and Nick Szabo) that led to Bitcoin's invention, which Hal Finney and Nick Szabo say he helped to inspire. He was one of the first economists to explore the economics of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. He is also an expert on the history and economics of old-fashioned metallic coinage. His book Good Money tells the story of the private minting of coins during Great Britain's Industrial Revolution. He is one of the foremost authorities on Gresham's Law‚Äîthe oldest of all economic laws concerning money. Since he joined the Cato Institute Selgin has become a leading critic of some of the Federal Reserve‚Äôs post- crisis policies, including its decision to permanently switch to an ample reserves or ‚Äúfloor‚Äù operating system, and its decision to build a ‚Äúreal time‚Äù retail payments network to compete with one established by commercial bankers. Most recently, he has taken on the growing movement to have the Fed make use of its Quantitative Easing powers, not solely to combat recessions, but as a means for funding ambitious government projects that can bypass Congress's normal appropriations process. Selgin is the twin brother to author and illustrator Peter Selgin and the half brother to Indonesian anthropology expert Clare Selgin Wolfowitz. His father, Paul Selgin, was an inventor whose numerous patents include many for optical measuring devices for use in manufacturing.

In 2001, the village of Zwaanshoek had 1250 inhabitants. In 2008, this had increased to 1780 inhabitants.

The wider statistical area of Zwaanshoek has a population of around 1660.Statistics Netherlands (CBS), Gemeente Op Maat 2004: Haarlemmermeer . Zwaanshoek is located on the edge of what used to be a lake, the Haarlemmermeer (which means lake of Haarlem‚Äù. This lake had been reclaimed and the Haarlemmermeerpolder was thus created. Until the 1950s the village did not have an official name and was called Bennebroekerbuurt, which means neighbourhood of Bennebroek. Later, this name was changed to Zwaanshoek, which means swan corner, because of the number of wild swans that were to be found. Initially, Zwaanshoek was just a small line of buildings along the dyke circling the Haarlemmermeer and along the road leading into the polder. In the 1970s and 80‚Äôs the village got bigger, when new buildings were constructed. New streets were built on the field of farmer van Leeuwen. In this new little district, a public school was built for kids of around 4 to 10 years old: de Zwanebloem. Predating this school, the village had another one, called school 8, because it was the eighth school of the Haarlemmermeer. Although school 8 isn‚Äôt used as a school anymore, it is now used as a village house, called de Oase (meaning the oasis). Here, different kinds of activities get hosted now, and Bridgeclub Zwaanshoek is one of the permanent users of the house. In 2003, a graveyard got opened in Zwaanshoek, called Meerterpen. This is meant to be used as a central graveyard for the entire Haarlemmermeer and replaces the graveyard in the northern part of Hoofddorp. No new graves could be dug there, because of the expanding airport Schiphol. The most important sports club is the tennisclub, established in 1976. A famous inhabitant of Zwaanshoek was Jan van Dooyeweerd. This horsetrainer had a company located on the Spieringweg. Van Dooyeweerd had been national champion multiple times and had won 2251 competitions. He died in 2005 and his son, Jan van Dooyeweerd junior, has continued the work of his father. Zwaanshoek was officially the smartest village of the Netherlands. 23% of 163 inhabitants between the ages of 18 and 27 goes to university. No other village or even city scores higher than this village.

He was (1906-1909) a member of the Swedish Rail Workers‚Äô Union, a faction in the Swedish Trade Union Confederation, and in 1909 became an editor for the union's newspaper Signalen. He was from 1911-1914 an Member of Parliament (social democrat) in the Swedish Riksdag's lower house (also known as Andra kammaren or Second Chamber) for the Stockholm City constituency and from 1912 till 1914 for Stockholm City second constituency.

Hendry was promoted to GM on July 5, 2002 by former Cubs President/CEO Andy MacPhail. He worked for the Cubs from 1995 to 2011. Prior to his promotion to GM, he was named Assistant GM/Player Personnel Director on October 12, 2001, and previously the Director of Player Development, in charge of both Scouting and Minor League Operations. Early life Hendry graduated from Spring Hill College, where he had majored in communications and journalism. He could not find a job in broadcasting, and took a job as a high school teacher and baseball coach in Miami. This led to a job at Creighton University in 1983, and he was promoted to head coach in the middle of the 1984 season. Following Creighton's 1991 College World Series appearance, Hendry was named National Coach of the Year. He left Creighton later that year to become special assistant to then Florida Marlins GM Dave Dombrowski, and also coached minor league teams in 1993 and '94. Jim has two kids, Lauren and John. Tenure with Cubs Hendry's tenure as general manager produced mixed results. In 2003, the Cubs made their first playoff appearance in the Hendry era, but just three years later, Hendry's Cubs had the worst record in the National League. One of his first moves provided fodder for critics and boosters alike: late in spring training 2002, he dealt Juli√°n Tav√°rez and Dontrelle Willis to the Florida Marlins for pitchers Matt Clement and Antonio Alfonseca. The deal produced mixed results; Clement was the Cubs' most consistent pitcher in 2002 and continued to be valuable in 2003, while Tavarez's volatile behavior was a distraction to the Cubs in 2001. On the downside, Alfonseca struggled while a Cub, and the minor league pitcher traded to the Marlins was Dontrelle Willis, the 2003 Rookie of the Year. The Cubs did not contend in 2002, and Hendry fired manager Don Baylor in July, replacing him with Iowa Cubs manager Bruce Kimm on an interim basis. The Cubs staggered to the end of the season in 2002, and Hendry purged several veterans from the roster. One veteran, Todd Hundley, a free agent acquisition before the 2001 season, struggled on the field, feuded with fans, and had even begun to tarnish the image of his father Randy Hundley, a member of the Cubs teams of the 1960s and 1970s. Hundley's large contract would have made trading him difficult, so the only way that he could leave the team would be if Hendry released him. Nevertheless, former Los Angeles Dodgers general manager Dan Evans, offered second baseman Mark Grudzielanek and first baseman Eric Karros. Grudzielanek and Karros were also high-priced veterans with their careers waning. But the two players managed productive seasons in 2003, also providing veteran leadership. Hendry made his biggest splash in the 2002‚Äì03 offseason when he hired former San Francisco Giants manager Dusty Baker to manage the club just days after Baker's Giants lost in seven games to the Anaheim Angels in the World Series. 2003 Cubs: Only five outs away The Cubs started 2003 well, but stumbled after center fielder Corey Patterson injured his knee in June. A little more than two weeks after his injury, Hendry sent prospect Bobby Hill and veteran Jos√© Hern√°ndez to the Pittsburgh Pirates for a center fielder who could replace Patterson for the remainder of the season, Kenny Lofton. The Cubs also received third baseman Aramis Ram√≠rez in the trade, ending the revolving door that had been at 3B ever since Ron Santo was traded to the White Sox. Ramirez blossomed into a star with the Cubs, and Lofton provided the spark at the top of the lineup that the Cubs needed. The Cubs won the National League Central Division title in 2003, and beat Atlanta in the National League Division Series, their first postseason series victory since 1908. They then came within five outs from their first World Series appearance since 1945. They were up three games to one on the Florida Marlins in the NLCS and ended up losing the last three games, including the infamous Game 6 involving fan Steve Bartman followed by an error by Alex Gonzalez on a routine double play ball that would have ended the inning with the score 3-1 in favor of the Cubs. The disappointment of 2004 After failing to close out the 2003 NLCS against the Florida Marlins, Hendry made several acquisitions, picking up first baseman Derrek Lee for Hee-seop Choi in a trade with the Marlins, acquiring catcher Michael Barrett in a three-way trade with the Oakland Athletics, giving up Damian Miller in the process and Montreal Expos, signing free agents LaTroy Hawkins, Todd Walker and Greg Maddux. On March 25, 2004, he sent prospect pitchers Juan Cruz and Steve Smyth to the Atlanta Braves for two minor leaguers, pitcher Andy Pratt and infielder Richard Lewis. The Cubs were Sports Illustrated's preseason choice to win the World Series in 2004. Injuries to key players like Mark Prior, Sammy Sosa, Kerry Wood, Joe Borowski, and Alex Gonzalez hindered the Cubs during the early part of the season. On July 31, Hendry made a four-team deal with the Montreal Expos, Minnesota Twins and Boston Red Sox, sending Gonzalez and prospects Brendan Harris and Francis Beltr√°n to the Expos and prospect Justin Jones to the Minnesota Twins. In return, the Cubs received All-Star shortstop Nomar Garciaparra from Boston, along with prospect Matt Murton. Garciaparra missed several games down the stretch because of an injury to his groin, forcing Hendry to sign Neifi P√©rez off of waivers. Meanwhile, the Cubs' bullpen became a bigger and bigger source of concern. With Borowski out for the season, the Cubs made Hawkins the closer, and Hawkins struggled down the stretch, blowing two key games the last week of the season. The Cubs led the Wild Card race by 1¬Ω games with nine to go before fading to three games behind the eventual Wild Card winner, the Houston Astros. As the Cubs saw their lead in the Wild Card race disintegrate, the Cubs became mired in controversy regarding the treatment of the team by television announcers Chip Caray and Steve Stone. After the 2004 season, Chip Caray signed a deal to broadcast Atlanta Braves games (with his father, Skip Caray) while Stone eventually decided not to return as Cubs' color commentator. Meanwhile, slugger Sammy Sosa walked out on his team twice at the end of the season. The first time came during an extra- inning loss to the Montreal Expos at Wrigley Field when Sosa, who did not start because of back spasms, decided to leave the ballpark in the seventh inning to beat traffic on Lake Shore Drive back to his condominium at Lake Point Towers. With Sosa not on the bench available to pinch-hit, Baker called on Ram√≥n Mart√≠nez to pinch-hit with the tying run on base in the 12th inning of a 7-6 loss. The second time came the last game of the season, when Sosa left the park moments after learning he wasn't in the starting lineup. When Sosa claimed he stayed until the seventh inning of the game, Hendry released a surveillance tape showing Sosa leaving the park shortly after the 1:20 first pitch. As a result, the first priority of the 2004‚Äì2005 offseason was unloading Sosa. After in-depth talks with the New York Mets and Washington Nationals, the Cubs sent Sosa to the Baltimore Orioles, getting utility player Jerry Hairston, Jr., second baseman Mike Fontenot and pitcher David Crouthers. Hendry then signed veteran Jeromy Burnitz to replace Sosa in right field. He signed middle reliever Chad Fox and traded Kyle Farnsworth to the Detroit Tigers for Roberto Novoa and minor-leaguers Scott Moore and Bo Flowers. 2006 Cubs: A season of disarray After a sub-.500 season marred by injuries in 2005, the Cubs made few major moves going into the 2006 season. Before the 2006 season, Hendry received a two-year contract extension from the Tribune Company. The biggest move was trading three young pitchers, Ricky Nolasco, Sergio Mitre and Renyel Pinto to the Marlins for center fielder Juan Pierre. In November, 2005, Hendry attempted to shore up his bullpen with relievers Scott Eyre and Bob Howry. The Cubs also signed free agent Jacque Jones to play right field. He signed injured free agent starter Wade Miller to a one-year, $1 million contract with $1 million in incentives. Hendry also re- signed journeymen players like Glendon Rusch and Neifi P√©rez to multi-year deals. Again, injuries marred the 2006 season with Lee going down with a broken wrist just 14 games into the season. Mark Prior and Kerry Wood again went down with frequent injuries. Another factor in the Cubs' poor performance in 2006 was their finishing last in the major leagues in walks. As the Cubs struggled into July, Hendry announced that he was going to evaluate the coaching staff's performance at the All-Star Break, causing many pundits to speculate that Baker, as well as coaches Gene Clines, Gary Matthews, Larry Rothschild and Dick Pole, were in jeopardy of losing their jobs. Hendry responded that he was not necessarily firing anyone, and that he would not necessarily finish his evaluation over the four-day break. On July 26, Hendry announced manager Dusty Baker would stay on for the rest of the season. At the end of July Hendry traded Maddux to the Los Angeles Dodgers for shortstop C√©sar Izturis, and Walker to the San Diego Padres for pitching prospect Jos√© Ceda, both of which were announced after the deadline had actually passed, but were completed before the deadline. Wade Miller made his first start of the season on September 9, 2006, making five starts total and finishing the season 0-2 with a 4.57 ERA. He filed for free agency after the season and has subsequently re-signed with a contract extension. On October 2, 2006, Hendry announced that the Cubs would not offer manager Dusty Baker a contract extension. The Cubs finished the 2006 season with 66 wins and 96 losses, finishing 17¬Ω games behind division winner and eventual 2006 World Series Champions St. Louis Cardinals and last place in the National League Central Division. It was the first time the Cubs finished in last place during Hendry's tenure as General Manager and first time as a team since 2000. Preparing for 2007 Hendry began a huge offseason spending spree starting on October 17, 2006 when Hendry hired veteran manager Lou Piniella to replace Dusty Baker as the Cubs manager for at least the next three seasons with a club option for a fourth season. On November 19, Hendry signed former Washington Nationals superstar Alfonso Soriano to an 8-year, $136 million contract to play outfield for the Cubs. Third baseman Aramis Ram√≠rez opted out of his current contract and filed for free agency, but subsequently signed a new contract with the Cubs, a five-year $73 million deal. In other moves, Hendry inked Wade Miller to an incentive laden, one-year $1.5 million extension to stay with the Cubs. He also signed free agent second baseman and utility player Mark DeRosa (previously of the Texas Rangers) to a three-year, $13 million deal on November 14, 2006. On November 16, 2006. he completed a trade sending relievers David Aardsma and prospect Carlos V√°squez to the cross-town rival Chicago White Sox for left-handed setup man Neal Cotts. On December 6, 2006, the Cubs agreed to a four-year, $40 million deal with free agent pitcher Ted Lilly, who played the previous season for the Toronto Blue Jays, beating out the New York Yankees, while Hendry was being hospitalized for chest pains. On December 9, it was reported that Hendry signed free agent Jason Marquis to a three-year, $20 million contract. Marquis had last pitched for St. Louis. On December 15, the Cubs also announced their signing of backup first baseman and outfielder Daryle Ward. Hendry also signed outfielder/1B veteran Cliff Floyd, a Chicago native, to a one-year, $3 million deal on January 24, 2007. Hendry inked Mark Prior to a one-year, $3.575 million contract for 2007 as well. The Cubs sent utility outfielder prospect Freddie Bynum to the Baltimore Orioles for a player to be named later (right-handed pitcher Kevin Hart). They selected former number-one Rule 5 draft pick Josh Hamilton from the Tampa Bay Devil Rays and immediately traded him to the Cincinnati Reds for cash considerations. In the draft, the Cubs also selected right-handed pitcher James Henderson from Washington, and lost: left-handed pitcher Edward Campusano to the Milwaukee Brewers, right-handed pitcher Lincoln Holdzkom to the Houston Astros, infielder Richard Lewis to the Kansas City Royals, and shortstop Jason Smith to Toronto. By the start of Spring Training, Hendry spent $300 million in new contracts. 2007 season With new ownership coming at the end of the 2007 season and with the Cubs falling in the standings in May and June, Hendry's chances of staying as the General Manager remained an open question at mid season. On May 28, 2007, Jim Hendry stated that his team was underachieving. At the time, the Cub had a 22-26 record and were five games behind division-leading Milwaukee. After June 2, the Chicago Cubs went on to put up the best record in baseball as they chased after a playoff spot. Help arrived when Jim Hendry made it clear that the team was a buyer and not a seller with the acquisitions of Jason Kendall, Craig Monroe and Steve Trachsel. On September 28, 2007, the Cubs clinched the National League Central for the first time since 2003 with an 84-76 record. The Cubs were swept by the Arizona Diamondbacks in the first round of the 2007 NLDS. In October 2008, the Cubs extended Hendry's contract for an additional four years. 2008 season Japanese superstar Kosuke Fukudome made his arrival to the U.S. and was signed by Hendry to a 4-year $48 Million contract to play right field. Fukudome began the season with strong play, but cooled down and left fans disappointed as the season wore on. Rich Harden was acquired from Oakland midway through the 2008 season and proved to be a key trade in their success. The Cubs led the Central Division nearly the entire year and ended with the best record in the National League (97 wins). However, against the Los Angeles Dodgers, they were once again swept in the NLDS. Final years with the Cubs (2009‚Äì11) Despite consistently having a team with one of the highest payrolls in baseball, the Cubs struggled in Hendry's final seasons with the club. From 2009 through 2011, the Cubs have had the 2nd, 1st, and 2nd highest payrolls in the National League respectively. Prior to 2009, Hendry signed enigmatic OF Milton Bradley to a 3 year/$30 million contract. The Cubs finished 2009 barely above .500 at 83-78 and Bradley was a major bust. He finished the year suspended by the team. In 2010, for most of the season they were one of the worst teams in the baseball. Despite finishing the season strongly, they ended up at 75-87. In 2011, the Cubs once again possessed one of the worst records in baseball, finishing at 71-91, 25 games behind the first-place Cardinals. Under Hendry's leadership, the Cubs drafted Javier Baez. Cubs Chairman Tom Ricketts notified Hendry on July 22, 2011, that he wouldn't be retained as general manager. Hendry was allowed to remain with the team to help get the Cubs‚Äô draft picks signed. He was relieved of his duties on August 19, 2011 and replaced on an interim basis by assistant general manager Randy Bush. Hendry was the first general manager in Cubs history to oversee three postseason clubs (2003, 2007, 2008) and was the first Cubs general manager to lead the franchise to consecutive postseason berths since the 1930s. Under his tenure, the Cubs were 749-748. He was the third longest serving general manager in the history of the club. New York Yankees (2012‚Äìpresent) On January 31, 2012 Hendry agreed to a multi-year deal to become a special assistant to Yankees GM Brian Cashman and is also listed as a special assignment scout.Leventhal, Josh, ed., Baseball America 2013 Directory.

Partick station is an interchange station in the Partick area of Glasgow, Scotland. Along with an adjacent bus station, it forms one of the main transport hubs in Glasgow. The station is served by Glasgow Subway and National Rail services and was one of the first to receive bilingual English and Gaelic signs, because there is a significant Gaelic-speaking population in the Partick area.The Gaels In Glasgow History The first station in the area was the North British Railway's , opened in 1887 slightly to the north of the existing site on the opposite side of the Dumbarton Road. Soon after, the Glasgow Subway opened and its Merkland Street station, slightly to the south of the existing station site, opened in December 1896. Neither was independently known as \\"Partick station\\" as there were two other railway stations in Partick between the late 19th and mid-20th centuries: (later renamed Kelvin Hall station) to the east with and to the west. Argyle Line opening The Beeching Axe of the 1960s closed and , both on the Lanarkshire and Dunbartonshire Railway link to the Stobcross Railway and Glasgow Central Railway, leaving just the two stations in Partick, with Partickhill station - which escaped closure owing to being on the newly electrified (1960) North Clyde line from Queen Street Low Level, served by the 'Blue Trains', with a major pre-electrification refurbishment in 1958. It stood a few hundred yards north of Merkland Street. The amalgamation of the two stations to a single site came in 1979, as a major refurbishment of the Glasgow Subway coincided with the Greater Glasgow Passenger Transport Executive's decision to reopen part of the Glasgow Central Railway, which had been axed by Beeching, as the Argyle Line and connecting it to the North Clyde system just east of Partick. Both stations were closed (Merkland Street had been since the Subway works began in May 1977, whilst Partickhill remained in service for several months after the Argyle Line opened, until replaced by the current Partick station) and replaced by British Rail with a new combined Partick station in the middle. The platforms at Partickhill are still visible from the North Clyde/Argyle Line, although access to Dumbarton Road is now blocked. The Merkland Street station buildings are no longer visible. The station is one of the primary stations on the Argyle Line and North Clyde Line of the Glasgow suburban rail network. These lines primarily provide services to the east and west although the station itself is orientated north‚Äìsouth with two platforms. Statistically, it is the tenth busiest railway station in ScotlandThe usage information (Station Entries and Station Exits) is based on ticket sales in the financial year 2002/03 and covers all National Rail stations.

Springburn line services have now also been extended to Cumbernauld eastbound and Dumbarton Central westbound on weekdays, with an hourly service to Cumbernauld via Springburn starting/terminating here on Sundays. Glasgow Subway Partick subway station is one of the largest stations on the Glasgow Subway network, and has around 1.01 million boardings per year.http://www.spt.co.uk/publications/stats2005/s&t2005.pdf; This is due in part to its situation within the city and also the National Rail network. Partick is a relatively large population centre of Glasgow housing around 100,000 people, a significant number of whom use the subway to commute to the city centre. Furthermore, Partick station is an interchange for two lines on the National Rail network. People commuting from outside Glasgow to one of the areas covered by the underground network may choose to continue their journey from Partick to allow for ease of transfer between the services and to avoid a lengthy walk between (for example) Glasgow Central and St. Enoch. It is one of only three with a dual side platform layout (the others being Govan and St Enoch). The rest have either a single central platform covering both circles or two platforms with a track running at the same side of each. The new Partick station replaced Merkland Street, which was located to the south, after modernisation. It should not be confused with the old Partick Cross subway station which is now known as Kelvinhall and is the next station clockwise from Partick. It is the only station on the Subway that interchanges directly with a railway station, although Buchanan Street station is linked to Queen Street by a length of moving walkway. St. Enoch once shared this distinction, before its parent St Enoch railway station was closed and demolished in the 1960s. Partick is one of three subway stations on the SPT Subway line to benefit from mobile telephone service nodes, the others being Buchanan Street and Hillhead. These nodes allow users of the O2 cellular network to use their mobile telephones while waiting on a subway train. The idea was to trial the technology at the busiest stations and, if successful, to put similar devices at each station eventually extending service across the entire network. As yet, the trial is incomplete.  Past passenger numbers  * 2011/12: 1.032 million annually Modernisation 2005‚Äì2009 project Inside the eastbound waiting room Strathclyde Passenger Transport began planning an extensive modernisation of the Partick station site ‚Äì which had remained largely unchanged since its opening in 1979 ‚Äì as early as 1998. Work began in late 2005 and was originally scheduled for completion in January 2007. However, delays to the project resulted in this date being put back on a number of occasions. The demolition and construction work was carried out while the site remained open to avoid any disruption in rail and underground services, arguably one of the most ambitious attributes of the project.Clyde Waterfront The total cost of the project was estimated to be around ¬£12.3 million with professional fees and third-party costs accounting for ¬£2.6 million of this. However, due to delays in the progression of the works and unforeseen difficulties ‚Äì such as ground conditions on the land the station occupies, only discovered after the commencement of work ‚Äì the company in charge of the development, C Spencer Construction, made a claim for a further ¬£6.3 million.Evening Times Online, Cost of Partick station revamp soars by ¬£6.3m, published 12 May 2008 In early 2009, the project finally reached its conclusion and on 31 March, the new station was officially opened to the public. The work done includes the construction of a completely new and modern station building which incorporates a brand new ticket office (which has been in use since 2008). The station concourse has been completely renovated and new signs have been posted similar to those seen in and Queen Street stations. Both railway platforms have been refurbished and now have their own indoor waiting rooms. Lifts linking the concourse to the National Rail platforms were installed.Partick Interchange Rebuilding SPT microsite (preserved at archive.org) 2012‚Äì2013 project The Subway platforms were renovated between summer 2012 and spring 2013 at a cost of ¬£1.2 million. All floor, wall, and ceiling finishes were replaced with new contemporary designs. Improved lighting, signage, and facilities for disabled people were introduced.http://www.spt.co.uk/2012/06/partick-subway-station-to- get-1-2-million-upgrade/ Lifts linking the concourse to the Subway platforms were to be installed as part of this project because the necessary land is not owned by SPT. The future provision of lifts has, however, been safeguarded.http://www.spt.co.uk/documents/rtp300312_agenda12.pdf References Notes Sources  Location of Partick station on navigable OS map External links *Video footage of Partick Station Category:Railway stations in Glasgow Category:Railway stations opened by British Rail Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1979 Category:SPT railway stations Category:Railway stations served by Abellio ScotRail Category:Partick Category:Glasgow Subway stations Category:Railway stations located underground in the United Kingdom ","title":"Partick station"},{"id":"4242995","title":"1973‚Äì74 FIS Alpine Ski World Cup"},{"id":"4242999","text":"The Constitution of Peru is the supreme law of Peru. The current constitution, enacted on 31 December 1993, is Peru's fifth in the 20th century and replaced the 1979 Constitution. The Constitution was drafted by the Democratic Constituent Congress that was convened by President Alberto Fujimori during the Peruvian Constitutional Crisis of 1992 that followed his 1992 dissolution of Congress, was promulgated on 29 December 1993. A Democratic Constitutional Congress (CCD) was elected in 1992, and the final text was approved in a 1993 referendum. The current Constitution of Peru differs from the 1979 Constitution in that it gives greater power to the president. For example, it allowed for reelection, reduced the bicameral 240-member congress to a unicameral 120 Congress of the Republic, not only affirmed the president's power to veto found in the 1979 Constitution, but also gave him the power to use a line item veto, and mandated that all tax laws receive prior approval by the Ministry of Economics and Finance. While the Constitution of 1979 allowed the president to dissolve congress after congress censured cabinet members three times, the current constitution allows the president to do so after only two censures. The Constitution allows the president to decree laws as long as he first informs the Congress of his intent to do so. If the president dissolves Congress, the Constitution gives him the power to rule until the election of a new Congress within a four-month timeline, during which time the Standing Committee of the dissolved Congress will remain functioning. minature book of The Smallest Books in the World. Following the ouster of President Alberto Fujimori, the Constitution was amended to bar the president from immediate re-election, a status quo that had prevailed for most of the time since the Great Depression.

It became effective in 1980 with the re- election of deposed President Fernando Bela√∫nde Terry. It limited the president to a single five-year term and established a bicameral legislature consisting of a 60-member Senate (upper house) and a 180-member Chamber of Deputies (lower house). It also eliminated the literacy requirement for voting and extended suffrage to all adults 18 or older.

The first edition of his collection was published in eight volumes from 1855 to 1867, earning him the reputation as being the Russian counterpart to the Brothers Grimm.  Life  Alexander Afanasyev was born in the town of Boguchar in the Voronezh Governorate of the Russian Empire (modern-day Voronezh Oblast of Russia) into a family of modest means. His mother Varvara Mikhailovna Afanasyeva came from common people. Alexander was her seventh child; she became very ill after giving birth and died by the end of the year. The children were raised by their father Nikolai Ivanovich Afanasyev, a Titular councillor who served as a prosecutor's assistant on probable causes and whom Alexander described as a man of high intellectual and moral qualities, \\"deservedly known as the smartest person in the whole uyezd\\". In three years the family moved to Bobrov, Voronezh where Alexander spent his childhood. He became addicted to reading early in his life, having access to the well-stocked library left by his grandfather (a member of the Russian Bible Society), as well as to various magazines. In 1837 he was sent to the Voronezh male gymnasium, and in 1844 he entered the Law Faculty of the University of Moscow which he finished in 1848. There he attended the lectures of Konstantin Kavelin, Timofey Granovsky, Sergey Solovyov, Stepan Shevyryov, Osip Bodyansky and Fyodor Buslaev. He published a series of articles on government economy during the times of Peter the Great, on the Pskov Judicial Charter and other topics in the Sovremennik and Otechestvennye Zapiski magazines. Despite being one of the most promising students, he failed to become a professor. The conservative Minister of National Enlightenment, Count Sergey Uvarov, who oversaw the final exams, attacked Afanasyev's essay which discussed the role of autocracy in the development of Russian criminal law during the 16th and 17th centuries., at p. 464‚Äì514 in 2014 reprint In 1849 Konstantin Kavelin helped him to get a place at the Moscow's Main Archive Directorate under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Empire, and here Afanasyev worked for the next 13 years. During that time he met many people of science and culture, collected a lot of ancient books and manuscripts that formed a huge library. His articles, reviews, ethnographical and historical works regularly appeared in the leading Russian magazines, newspapers, almanacs and scientific periodicals. His essays on Russian satire of the 18th century and on the works of prominent writers and publishers resulted in an 1859 monograph \\"–†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–µ —Å–∞—Ç–∏—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ –∂—É—Ä–Ω–∞–ª—ã 1769‚Äì1774 –≥.\\" (\\"Russian Satirical Magazines of 1769‚Äî1774\\"), published in 'Otechestvennye Zapiski' (Nos.3, 4 of 1855; No.6 of 1859). In 1855 he headed the state commission responsible for publication of legislative, historical and literary works. From 1858 to 1861 he also worked as the main editor of the short-lived magazine \\"Bibliographical Notes\\" (:ru:–ë–∏–±–ª–∏–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ –∑–∞–ø–∏—Å–∫–∏) which actually served as a cover for collecting materials, censored and revolutionary literature for the socialist in exile Alexander Herzen. In 1862 the authorities arrested the Narodnik Nikolay Chernyshevsky, while other people associated with Herzen, including Afanasiev, came under suspicion. His flat was searched, and while nothing was revealed, he still lost his place at the Moscow Archives. After his dismissal he couldn't find a stable job for several years and had to sell his library to feed his family. After that he worked as a secretary at the Moscow City Duma and at the Moscow Congress of Justices of the Peace while continuing his ethnographical research. He wrote a large theoretical work (three tomes of 700 pages each) ‚Äì \\"The Poetic Outlook of Slavs about Nature\\" (:ru:–ü–æ—ç—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ –≤–æ–∑–∑—Ä–µ–Ω–∏—è —Å–ª–∞–≤—è–Ω –Ω–∞ –ø—Ä–∏—Ä–æ–¥—É) ‚Äì which came out between 1865 and 1869. In 1870 his –†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–µ –¥–µ—Ç—Å–∫–∏–µ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∫–∏ (Russian Children's Fairy Tales) were published. Afanasyev spent his last years living in penury. He died in Moscow aged 45, suffering from tuberculosis. He was buried at the Pyatnitskoye cemetery. , Alexander Afanasyev's tomb  Work  Afanasyev became interested in old Russian and Slav traditions and stories in the 1850s (\\"folklore\\" as an area of study did not exist at the time). His early scholarly articles, including ‚Äì \\"–í–µ–¥—É–Ω –∏ –≤–µ–¥—å–º–∞\\" (\\"Wizard and Witch\\", published in \\"–ö–æ–º–µ—Ç–∞\\", 1851); \\"–Ø–∑—ã—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ –ø—Ä–µ–¥–∞–Ω–∏—è –æ–± –æ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤–µ –ë—É—è–Ω–µ\\" (\\"Pagan legends of Buyan Island\\", published in \\"–í—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω–∏–∫–µ –æ–±—â. –∏—Å—Ç. –∏ –¥—Ä–µ–≤. —Ä–æ—Å—Å.\\" of 1858 No. 9) ‚Äì drew upon the so-called Mythological school that treated legends and tales as a mine of information for the study of more ancient pagan mythology (see his definitive work on the subject \\" –ü–æ—ç—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ –≤–æ–∑–∑—Ä–µ–Ω–∏—è —Å–ª–∞–≤—è–Ω –Ω–∞ –ø—Ä–∏—Ä–æ–¥—É \\" (\\"The Poetic Outlook on Nature by the Slavs\\", 1865‚Äî1869). In such an interpretation, he regarded the fairy tale Vasilisa the Beautiful as depicting the conflict between the sunlight (Vasilisa), the storm (her stepmother), and dark clouds (her stepsisters). A great archivist, his works provide copious information, evidence, documents, and passages of the old chronicles relating to Old Russian culture, history and tradition, as well as other Indo-European languages, folklore and legends, in particular German traditions (he knew to perfection German as well as all Slav languages and ancient ones). In the early 1850s, being already known for his articles, Afanasyev began to think about a collection of folk tales. He was then asked by the Russian Geographical Society (ethnography section) of Saint Petersburg to publish the folktales archives that the Society had been in possession of for about ten years. These archives are at the start of his Collection. Afanasyev chose 74 tales out of these. He added to them the enormous collection of Vladimir Dal (about 1000 texts), from which he kept 148 numbers, finding the other ones too distorted, his own collection (of about 10 folktales from the Voronejh region), and a few other collections. He added already published tales (such as Maria Marievna, The Firebird, The Grey Wolf, etc.), a few tales coming from epic songs, stories about the dead, a few medieval satirical texts (such as The Shemiaka Sentence), and anecdotes. He owes his prominent place in the history of Slavonic philology chiefly to these Russian Fairy Tales (\\"–ù–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω—ã–µ —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–µ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∫–∏\\"), published between 1855 and 1863, and inspired by the famous collection of the Brothers Grimm. From the scientific point of view, his collection goes further. He had at his disposal a lot of contributors, he tried to give the source and place where the tale was told, he never tried to give any definitive version of a folktale: so, if he gathered 7 versions of one folk type, he edited them all (this is the case for The FireBird for instance). His collection was ahead of his time. In 1860 a scandal was provoked following the publication of the ¬´–†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–µ –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω—ã–µ –ª–µ–≥–µ–Ω–¥—ã¬ª (\\"National Russian Legends\\", 1860), a collection of folk tales from all over the country based on the lives of Jesus and Christian saints. The result was a unique blend of Christianity with paganism and social undertones. Some of them were labeled as unorthodox by the Most Holy Synod and the book was officially banned. He also prepared –ó–∞–≤–µ—Ç–Ω—ã–µ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∫–∏ (\\"Treasured Tales\\"), an assortment of redacted tales from \\"–†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–µ –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω—ã–µ –ª–µ–≥–µ–Ω–¥—ã\\" plus other potential controversial stories ‚Äì published as Russian Forbidden Tales in Switzerland anonymously because of their obscene and anticlerical subject matter.

Though written Church Slavonic had existed since the 10th century, it was used almost solely by the church and only for parochial written works. It was not until the 18th and 19th centuries that a sizable body of secular literature developed in vernacular Russian. Thus, Afanasyev's collections made a highly valuable contribution to the dissemination and legitimization of Russian culture and folk belief. The influence of these folk tales can be seen in the works of many writers and composers, notably Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov (Sadko, The Snow Maiden) and Igor Stravinsky (The Firebird, Petrushka, and L'Histoire du soldat).

Up until the 19th century, Zwanenburg was under water. When the pumping station at Halfweg had succeeded in making the land ripe for building, the workers who had settled at Halfweg purchased this cheap land below the dike for their homes. The infrastructure linking Halfweg to Haarlem and Amsterdam was already quite good, so Zwanenburg became a true commuter town. Halfweg was also the site of a large sugar factory, first opened in 1863, that served as an employer for Zwanenburg residents for more than a century.

King Jinpyeong followed in the footsteps of his predecessor, King Jinji, by reorganizing the central ruling system of Silla. Upon the onset of a multitude of conflicts between Baekje and Goguryeo, he sent emissaries to improve relations and strengthen ties between Silla and the Chinese dynasties Sui and Tang. He is also known for his promotion of Buddhism as a spiritual guide for the kingdom and encouraging Buddhist teachings. King Jinpyeong at Doosan Encyclopedia Life King Jinpyeong was born as Kim Baek-Jeong. His father, Crowned Prince Dongryun, was the first son of King Jinheung. And his mother, Lady Mano, was the daughter of Galmunwang, Kim Reep Jong. Samguk Sagi described King Jinpyeong as someone: big in stature, has a notable face and possessed great determination and sharp intellect as a youth. His father, Prince Dongryun, died before being able to ascend the throne. Four years later, King Jinheung died, his second son, King Jinji ascended the throne and became the 25th King of Silla. After 3 years, King Jinji was overthrown and eventually died a year after, King Jinpyeong was then proclaimed as Silla's 26th ruler. He married Queen Maya, the daughter of Galmunwang Bokseung, they had three daughters: Princess Cheonmyeong, Princess Deokman and Princess Seonhwa. He also had children with his concubines. Samguk Yusa says that he had another wife after Queen Maya, she's called Lady Seungnam who later on became his second Queen. According to Hwarang Segi, after Princess Deokman was nominated as King Jinpyeong's successor, Queen Seungnam gave birth to a son which put Princess Deokman's status as a successor at stake. However, her son died shortly for unknown reason. Queen Seungnam blamed Princess Deokman and Kim Yongchun for the death of her child. It is said that she was forced to leave the palace because of her severe jealousy which caused disturbance to the palace. Princess Deokman became the 27thruler of Silla after him. Princess Cheonmyeong's son, became the 29th ruler of Silla. According to Samguk Yusa, his third daughter Princess Seonhwa, married King Mu of Baekje. (Historians considered this unlikely, given the hostilities between the rival kingdoms.) Princess Seonhwa at Doosan Encyclopedia Reign Since King Jinpyeong was only 13 years old when he ascended the throne, Queen Dowager Sado, had to serve as a Regent until he reach the legal age. However, Queen Sado still refused to give him full control of Silla even after he reached the legal age. She appointed Noribu, as the Sangdaedeung and Hujik as the head of the Military. Noribu died on December of 588, Sueulbu became the next Sangdaedeung after him. King Jinpyeong relied heavily on these two chief officials to solidify his kingdom in both internal affairs and international relations. He also gave the rank of Galmunwang to his brothers Baekban and Gukban, to solidify his power in the court. King Jinpyeong's achievement was the way he strengthened the Kingdom and improved the political system. He named himself, his wife and his younger siblings as people related to the Buddha which eventually made the entire royal family being seen as a especial household for the throne, completely different compared to the rest of the royal nobles. He also built different departments for different political purposes, such as: The Ministry of Culture and Tourism and the Ministry of Education. Buddhism was embraced during this era, as King Jinpyeong actively sent envoys and monks to China to study and help in diplomatic relations. Buddhism in Silla developed as a strong, nation-protecting religion. Year 594, King Jinpyeong sent a diplomat to Sui dynasty of China in order to establish a diplomatic relationship between their countries. Two years later, he sent Monk Damyook to Sui in order to study Chinese Buddhism. Year 602, Amak Fortress was invaded by Baekje forces led by General Hae Su. As a result, King Jinpyeong sent thousands of soldiers to fight them back and built fortresses in Cheonsan, Sota and Wae Seok. However, King Mu of Baekje fought back by sending 40,000 troops to attack the said fortresses. Silla sent General Gunpoom and Mu Eun to fight them back. During the battle, Mu Eun fell into Hae Su's ambush and almost got killed but was saved by his son Gwisan and Chu Hang, however the two were both killed in the battle. The bravely they have shown in their death raised the morale of Silla's army as a result, Baekje forces had no other choice but to retreat. Year 603, King Yeongyang of Goguryeo sent his General, Go Seung to attack the north side of Han Fortress. And so, King Jinpyeong retaliated by leading the army himself with 10,000 troops and succeeded. Year 605, Silla attacked Baekje. However, Goguryeo attacked them as a result. Year 608, King Jinpyeong ordered Monk Won-Gwang to write a letter to Sui Dynasty, asking them for assistance to attack Goguryeo, knowing that the Emperor of Sui wasn't happy about Goguryeo's refusal of paying tributes. When King Yeongyang heard of it, he attacked Silla and took over Woo Myeong fortress and captured 8,000 people of Silla. Year 611, King Jinpyeong asked Sui again to attack Goguryeo again. July of the same year, Kajam fortress was invaded by the Baekje. The next year, Emperor Yang of Sui decided to attack Goguryeo with more than 1 million troops. However, Sui lost and retreated just few months after the attack. The Emperor of Sui Dynasty continued to attack Goguryeo for the next 3 years out embarrassment for their lost, but still ended up in failure. Year 616, Baekje attacked Mosan Fortress but retreated right away. Year 618, Sui Dynasty has fallen and was preceded by Tang Dynasty . That same year, King Jinpyeong ordered Byeon Poom to take back Kajam fortress from the Baekje but failed to do so. After that loss, King Jinpyeong sent a diplomat to the new dynasty of Tang, in order to establish a diplomatic relationship between their countries. Year 623, Baekje attacked Neuk Noh of Silla. Year 624, Baekje surrounded 6 fortresses of Silla. General Nool Choi fought back bravely but was only able to take back 3 of those fortresses. Year 625, King Jipyeong sent a messenger to Tang and told them that Goguryeo was blocking Silla's route from paying tributes to Tang. Emperor Taizong of Tang, asked Goguryeo to stop attacking Silla, which the King of Goguryeo heed to. Year 626, Baekje conquered Jujae fortress of Silla and killed the official of Dong So. Silla decided to build Go Hyeo fortress to prepare for the future attack. Year 627, General Sa Gyeol of Baekje, took 2 fortresses from the western part of Silla and capture its residence. Year 628, Silla succeeded in taking Kajam fortress back. Year 629, Kim Yongsu and Kim Seo Hyun, conquered Nangbi fortress of Goguryeo. Because of non-stop wars against the Baekje and Gogurye, Silla became very poor and resulted to famine. Many families sold their children and lands. May of 631, Chilseok and Seokpum planned a rebellion but their plan was discovered early and, as a result, Chilseok was beheaded in the marketplace along with his entire family. Seokpum was able to escape and run all the way to the Baekje border but the thought of his wife made him come back after exchanging clothes with a woodcutter, he was then arrested by the soldiers that were waiting for him at his house and was executed later on. On that same year, King Jinpyeong sent two beautiful women from Silla to the emperor of Tang, but they were sent back to Silla. Year 632, King Jinpyeong died at age of 66 after reigning Silla for 53 years. He was succeeded by his daughter Kim Deokman, who became Queen Seondeok later on, the first female ruler of Korea. Reforms King Jinpyeong continued to restructure and reorganize during his reign; in 581 he set up Wihwabu (hangul:ÏúÑÌôîÎ∂Ä, hanja:‰ΩçÂíåÂ∫ú), an administrative department for managing government officials and personnel, and in 583 Seonbuseo (hangul:ÏÑ†Î∂ÄÏÑú, hanja:ËàπÂ∫úÁΩ≤), a department for the management of the country's navy. He established an independent era reign name in 584, the department Jobu (hangul:Ï°∞Î∂Ä, hanja:Ë™øÂ∫ú) to oversee taxes and obligatory labor, and Seungbu (hangul:ÏäπÎ∂Ä, hanja:‰πòÂ∫ú) to manage transport wagons and coaches. Three officials were appointed to manage the major three palaces in 585, and in 586 the department Yebu (hangul:ÏòàÎ∂Ä, hanja:Á¶ÆÈÉ®) was established to oversee rituals and ceremonies. In 588, he placed Ichan Sueulbu (hangul:Ïù¥Ï∞¨ ÏàòÏùÑÎ∂Ä, hanja ‰ºäÈ£° È¶ñ‰πôÂ§´) as the highest government official of Sangdaedeung, and a special department that looked after foreign diplomats, Younggaekbu (hangul:ÏòÅÍ∞ùÎ∂Ä, hanja:È†òÂÆ¢Â∫ú), was set up in 591. King Jinpyeong at Encyclopedia of Korean Culture The King also made reforms in the regional counties and prefecture system. A new district, Bukhansanju (hangul:Î∂ÅÌïúÏÇ∞Ï£º, hanja:ÂåóÊº¢Â±±Â∑û), was created in preparation against attacks from Goguryeo in 604, and in 614 Ilseonju (hangul:ÏùºÏÑ†Ï£º, hanja:‰∏ÄÂñÑÂ∑û) was formed in preparation against Baekje. Namcheonju at Doosan Encyclopedia Ilseonju at The Academy of Korean Studies In 622, King Jinji's son Kim Yong Chun was appointed as the first Naeseongsasin (hangul:ÎÇ¥ÏÑ±ÏÇ¨Ïã†, hanja:ÂÖßÁúÅÁßÅËá£), the official who managed the three major palaces. The reforms continued with the department of the Palace Guards Siwibu (hangul:ÏãúÏúÑÎ∂Ä, hanja:‰æçË°õÂ∫ú); the department Sangsaseo (hangul:ÏÉÅÏÇ¨ÏÑú, hanja:Ë≥ûË≥úÁΩ≤), which looked after national heroes and their families; and Daedoseo (hangul:ÎåÄÎèÑÏÑú, hanja:Â§ßÈÅìÁΩ≤) which oversaw affairs regarding Buddhism. King Jinpyeong at The Academy of Korean Studies Buddhism and relations with China King Jinpyeong was a fervent advocate for Buddhism, and many monks made travels to China during his rule while serving diplomatic roles. The monk Jimyeong (hangul:ÏßÄÎ™Ö, hanja:Êô∫Êòé) who went to China's Chen Dynasty in 585 to study Buddhism returned in 602 with emissaries, and the monk Wongwang (hangul:ÏõêÍ¥ë, hanja:ÂúìÂÖâ), who had gone to study in China in 589, also returned with emissaries in 600. Wongwang at Encyclopedia of Korean Culture The monk Damyuk (hangul:Îã¥Ïú°, hanja:ÊõáËÇ≤) also went to study under the Sui Dynasty in 596, with emissaries and gifts sent from King Jinpyeong. Damyuk at Encyclopedia of Korean Culture These emissaries to China including Buddhist monks were continuously sent during King Jinpyeong's reign, and the two countries remained on amicable terms. In 608, when Silla was under attack from Baekje and Goguryeo, King Jinpyeong asked for the Sui's aid, with requests written by the monk Wongwang. Sui complied and joined forces with Silla in their attacks of Goguryeo, and in 613 Emperor Yang of Sui sent emissaries to Silla who participated in Buddhist ceremonies held by Monk Wongwang at Hwangnyong Temple.Bang Hakbong (Î∞©ÌïôÎ¥â), Stories of our ancestors who shook China (Ï§ëÍµ≠ÏùÑ Îí§ÌùîÎì† Ïö∞Î¶¨ ÏÑ†Ï°∞ Ïù¥ÏïºÍ∏∞) pp 216-217, Ilsong Book, Seoul, 2004. Diplomatic relations with China continued throughout the Sui Dynasty and the following Tang Dynasty. Gifts were sent with emissaries to Tang in 621 and the Emperor Gaozu sent silks, folding screens of art with an official statement in return.Lee Jeok, Queen Seondeok p59 These diplomatic relations continued in the following years and Silla used this relation for asking for Tang's assistance against Goguryeo. Emperor Gaozu of Tang sent governors to both Silla and Goguryeo in 626 to bring about a truce between the two countries, albeit briefly. Conflicts with Baekje and Goguryeo Although King Jinpyeong focused on reinforcing defense by building forts and fortresses and strengthening the military system, Silla was in constant conflict with its two neighbors, Baekje and Goguryeo. In 602, Baekje troops attacked the fortress Amak (hangul:ÏïÑÎßâÏÑ±, hanja:ÈòøËé´Âüé) but were turned back, and in 603 Gogguryeo attacked the fortress at Bukhansan (hangul:Î∂ÅÌïúÏÇ∞ÏÑ±, hanja:ÂåóÊº¢Â±±Âüé) but were defeated when King Jinpyeong himself joined the battle. Baekje continued with their attacks in 605, as did Goguryeo. King Jinpyeong sent the monk Wongwang to Sui with a request for aid against these attacks in 608. The aid from Sui came after Silla had lost many people and fortresses, and ultimately the joined forces failed in deterring Goguryeo attacks. Conflicts with Baekje escalated in 611, when they attacked the fortress of Gajam (hangul:Í∞ÄÏû†ÏÑ±, hanja:Ê§µÂ≤ëÂüé) and claimed it after a brutal battle of 100 days. Gajamseong at Doosan Encyclopedia Ongoing attacks included one on the fortress of Mosan (hangul:Î™®ÏÇ∞ÏÑ±, hanja:ÊØçÂ±±Âüé) in 616, Baekgi at Encyclopedia of Korean Culture Neuknohyeon (hangul:ÎäëÎÖ∏ÌòÑ, hanja:ÂãíÂº©Á∏£) in 623, and the three fortresses of Sokham (hangul:ÏÜçÌï®ÏÑ±, hanja:ÈÄüÂê´Âüé), Gijam (hangul:Í∏∞Ïû†ÏÑ±, hanja:Ê≠ßÊö´Âüé), and Hyeolchaek (hangul:ÌòàÏ±ÖÏÑ±, hanja:Á©¥ÊüµÂüé)in 624. Nulchoe at Encyclopedia of Korean Culture King Mu at Doosan Encyclopedia In 626 Baekje attacked the fortress of Jujae (hangul:Ï£ºÏû¨ÏÑ±, hanja:‰∏ªÂú®Âüé), and two additional fortresses were taken with many people taken hostage in 627. In 628, Silla defeated Baekje at the fortress of Gajam and in 629 generals Kim Yong Chun (ÍπÄÏö©Ï∂ò), Kim Seo Hyeon (ÍπÄÏÑúÌòÑ), and Kim Yushin (ÍπÄÏú†Ïã†) conquered Goguryeo's fortress Nangbi (hangul:ÎÇ≠ÎπÑÏÑ±, hanja:Â®òËáÇÂüé). Later reign The continuous battles with Baekje and Goguryeo took its toll on Silla and its people. Drought, famine, and disquiet spread through the country. The ruling nobility frequently held conflicting political views; when King Jinpyeong designated his daughter Princess Deokman as his heir the division grew even deeper, as many nobles were opposed to the idea of having a queen.Lee Jeok, Queen Seondeok p70 Park Young-gyu (Î∞ïÏòÅÍ∑ú), Chronicles of the Silla Dynasty (Ïã†ÎùºÏôïÏ°∞Ïã§Î°ù), Woongjin.com, Seoul, 2004. Political dissension reached its peak in May 631, when Ichan Chilsuk (Ïù¥Ï∞¨ Ïπ†Ïàô) and Achan Seokpum (ÏïÑÏ∞¨ ÏÑùÌíà) plotted an uprising based on their opposition to having Princess Deokman as their next ruler. The revolt was discovered in advance and was stopped by Alcheon and Bidam; Chilsuk was beheaded in public and his relatives executed. Although Seokpum was able to escape, he later returned and was eventually captured and killed. Chilsuk at The Academy of Korean Studies Seokpum at The Academy of Korean Studies With the rebellion put down, power was left mainly in the hands of the King's supporters (the most important of them was Kim Yushin, Commander in Chief of the Royal Army from 629), and it was in this political atmosphere that Princess Deokman was able to become Queen.Lee Jeok, Queen Seondeok p73 King Jinpyeong died in January 632, in the 54th year of his reign. He is buried in Bomun-dong, Gyeongju. His tomb was designated a historical landmark by the Korean government in 1969. Tomb of King Jinpyeong at Doosan Encyclopedia Legends The King's Jade Belt There is a story about King Jinpyeong's jade belt in the history Samguk Yusa, in which the belt is said to have been given by the heavens. In 579, when King Jinpyeong ascended to the throne, angels landed on the palace gardens and gave King Jinpyeong a gift from the Jade Emperor. King Jinpyeong always wore this belt in rituals and ceremonies in honor of the heavens. Along with the 9 story pagoda and statue of Buddha at Hwangnyong Temple, the jade belt is considered one of the three main treasures of Silla. After the fall of Silla, King Gyeongsun gave the belt to Goryeo's Taejo. Angel jade belt at Korean Culture Encyclopedia The Fire of Mojiak The first record of coal in Korea is in the Samguk Sagi, where there is a description of a \\"fire burning under the ground of Mojiak (hangul:Î™®ÏßÄÏïÖ, hanja:ÊØõÂè™Â∂Ω) for 9 months during the reign of King Jinpyeong in the year 609\\".

He published over 50 works and was the recipient of numerous awards, including the Prix Interalli√© for his 1970 novel, Les Poneys sauvages (The Wild Ponies). D√©on's 1973 novel Un taxi mauve received the Grand Prix du roman de l'Acad√©mie fran√ßaise. His novels have been translated into numerous languages. He is considered to have been one of the most innovative French writers of the 20th century. In 1978, D√©on was elected to the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise. Early years Michel D√©on was born in Paris on 4 August 1919, the only child of a civil servant and his wife. His father took his family along on the many foreign trips his work required, stimulating his son's interest in travel and cross-cultural relations that came to define his writings. D√©on's father died in 1933 while on assignment in Monaco serving as advisor to Prince Louis. He and his mother returned to Paris, where D√©on attended the Lyc√©e Janson-de-Sailly. Although he was passionate about literature and journalism, D√©on acquiesced to familial pressure and studied law in college. Born a year after the end of World War I, he adopted the pacifism popular with many others of his generation. When drafted into the French military, he was assigned to the 152nd regiment under General de Lattre. Back to civil life, he was secretary to Charles Maurras, an elderly writer and poet, member of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise since 1938, and the main inspiration behind Action Fran√ßaise, a counter-revolutionary, monarchist political movement who embraced collaboration. In Lyon, Deon mostly helped Maurras in editing the quality newspaper of the same name. Maurras, a fatherly figure, instilled in the young D√©on a distaste for both demagogy and fascism. D√©on said that freedom is his highest value, both in life and for the individual [reference needed] . This crucial experience is related in D√©on's book of memories, \\"les Vingt ans du jeune homme vert\\" ( or Green young man, see below.) Career At the end of World War II, D√©on returned to Paris to dedicate himself to a literary career. He first worked for a series of small-press French newspapers to support himself while drafting a novel and short stories. His first collection of short stories, Adieux √† Sheila, was published in 1944. Shortly after his first publication, D√©on received a Rockefeller Foundation grant that supported his travels through the United States. While there, D√©on worked alongside William Faulkner and Saul Bellow. Their collaboration proved beneficial for all three of them and D√©on assisted Bellow in translating his works into French. Alongside such contemporary French writers as Jacques Laurent, Antoine Blondin, and Roger Nimier, D√©on staunchly opposed the existentialism of Sartre and other prominent cultural figures. D√©on and his fellow authors became known as Les Hussards, named after Nimier's novel The Blue Hussar. They were recognized for their innovative unconventionality, sympathy for the bizarre underdog, and pervasive refusal to adopt fashionable themes and tone. In 1944, Roland Laudenbach and Jean Cocteau founded √âditions de la Table ronde (Round Table Publishing), a publishing enterprise that published works by many members of Les Hussards. Table ronde published several of D√©on's novels, including Les Gens de la Nuit, La Carotte et le B√¢ton, and Tout L'Amour du Monde II. After Table ronde became a subsidiary of √âditions Gallimard around 1970, Gallimard published more than twenty of D√©on's works. In 1970, D√©on's novel Les Poneys sauvages (The Wild Ponies) was awarded the Prix Interalli√©, given annually since 1930 to the best novel written by a journalist. D√©on wrote his critical masterpiece Un taxi mauve (A Purple Taxi) in 1973. It became an immediate literary sensation and won the Grand Prix du Roman de l'Acad√©mie fran√ßaise. Un Taxi Mauve was made into a film in 1977. The following year, 1978, D√©on was elected to the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise. In addition to his numerous individual works and awards, D√©on has collaborated with several public figures. In 1953, he assisted Coco Chanel in writing her autobiography, though she refused to have it published. D√©on destroyed the only existing copy for the sake of his friendship with her. In 1966, D√©on worked with Salvador Dal√≠ on the artist's memoirs, Diary of a Genius. Personal life Much of D√©on's work engages his experience via travel to such locations as Switzerland, Italy, Canada, and Portugal. During the 1940s, he explored the United States by Greyhound Bus. D√©on was an affiliate member of the Portuguese Academy of Science and Letters. He is a doctor honoris causa at the universities of Athens and Ireland. He is also an honorary citizen of Nice, Aix-en-Provence, and Antibes. His works have been translated into many languages. D√©on and his wife Chantal raised their two children, Alice and Alexandre, on the small Greek island of Spetsai. When the children reached school age in 1968, France was in a state of upheaval. The D√©on family settled in Ireland. For over forty years, D√©on and his family made Ireland their home, raising Chantal's fifty horses. There D√©on wrote on his Louis XVI desk. He visited France frequently. D√©on died from a pulmonary embolism at the age of 97 on 28 December 2016 in Galway, Ireland. Novels Les Poneys Sauvages (1970) is a story of murder, intrigue, and revenge. It begins in 1937, as George, Barry, Cyril, and Horace, students of varying backgrounds, complete their educations at the University of Cambridge. As the decade ends, the group becomes tangled in the Second World War. Those who survive the war take the reader on a journey that spans three decades and covers all of Europe, from Italy to Poland and back to Paris. As the friends age, they learn that the past is not forgotten quickly. In 1981, it was the basis of a six-part television series that starred H√©l√®ne Vincent. Un Taxi Mauve (1973) follows a group of troubled European and American expatriates who have settled in rural Ireland ‚Äì each for his own reason. Living in a self-punishing exile, their interactions create a tangle of love and deceit. An English-language film based on the novel, released in 1977 and called The Purple Taxi in English, starred Fred Astaire, Charlotte Rampling, and Philippe Noiret. In The Foundling Boy (Le Jeune Homme Vert) (1975), the infant Jean, born in 1919, is adopted by a rural couple who help maintain a wealthy family's estate. The novel follows his adventures and those of several others, notably the owner of the estate on which he is raised, until he joins the French army at the start of World War II. Diane Johnson compared Jean to Fielding's Tom Jones, noting how \\"his picaresque adventures unfold in cheerful profusion, in and out of foreign countries and strange beds\\". She also recommended the novel for its depiction of the European political climate in the years between the world wars. A sequel, The Foundling's War (Les Vingt Ans du Jeune Homme Vert), appeared in 1977. In Un Souvenir (1990), Edward has just passed his sixtieth year and is beginning to consider himself an old man. He finds an old photo from 1936. It shows him hugging a beautiful girl named Sheila, an obscure yet unforgettable woman he met in England during the war. Despite his age, he returns to England to find her and come to terms with the regret and guilt at having lost her. In Pages Grecques (1993), D√©on explores the multi-layered mythical and actual history of Greek culture. Employing the gods, muses, and legendary Greek figures, alongside historical events and characters, D√©on weaves Greece's dual histories together to create a beautiful and inspiring picture of the culture. The Great and the Good (La Cour Des Grands, 1996) follows the life of Arthur Morgan, the son of an impoverished French widow. He is offered a first class boat ticket to the United States in 1950 and there experiences all the classic elements of the American dream, graduating college and moving to New York City where he becomes a successful stockbroker. When he returns to France in the face of family tragedy, he is forced to reconcile his American life with a past life and is shocked to discover what has become of the friends of his youth. Horseman, Pass By! (Cavalier, passe ton chemin!, 2005) offers a social history of the Irish people that combines fact and fiction. Exploring the country's extraordinary folklore and cultural legends, D√©on examines the nation's collective identity. English translations An English translation of Un d√©jeuner de soleil appeared in 1983 (UK) and 1989 (US) as Where Are You Dying Tonight?. Le Jeune Homme vert appeared as The Foundling Boy in 2013, and the publisher, Gallic Books, published a translation of the sequel, Les Vingt Ans du Jeune Homme Vert as The Foundling's War in 2014., \\"La Cours des grandes\\" as \\"The Great and the Good\\" in 2017.

The station is west of and west of Glasgow Queen Street on the Argyle and North Clyde Lines. It is managed by Abellio ScotRail. The station was opened by British Railways as part of the electrification of the North Clyde Lines on 5 November 1960, replacing a nearby Hyndland (Stobcross Railway) railway station which was located at the end of a short branch line from Partickhill. This was subsequently adapted for use as an EMU maintenance depot, but eventually closed in 1987.

Beginning in 1862, the SP and its predecessorsSee under Lines. operated local steam-drawn ferry-train passenger service in the East Bay on an expanding system of lines, but in 1902 the Key SystemSappers (1948).Demoro (Parts 1 and 2). started a competing system of electric lines and ferries. The SP then drew up plans to expand and electrify its system of lines and this new service began in 1911. The trains served the cities of Berkeley, Albany, Emeryville, Oakland, Alameda, and San Leandro transporting commuters to and from the large Oakland Pier (the \\"mole\\") and SP Alameda Pier. A fleet of ferry boats ran between these piers and the docks of the Ferry Building on the San Francisco Embarcadero. The East Bay Electric Lines became the Interurban Electric Railway (IER) in December 1938 in anticipation of the completion the following month of the tracks on the lower deck of the San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge to the San Francisco Transbay Terminal. SP IER transbay commuter train service ended in July 1941. Lines 1927 map of the East Bay Electric Lines near their full extent The East Bay Electric Lines were originally designated mainly by the names of their principal streets. They received numbers for Bay Bridge service. The most significant changes occurred as the result of the removal of the Harrison St. bridge between Oakland and Alameda in December 1923, and the agreement with the Key System in March 1933, with the Bay Bridge plans in view, to abandon duplicating lines, on the basis of which company first served each area. The Oakland 7th Street Line carried the most passengers, with the Berkeley Shattuck Avenue Line being second. Patronage was at a maximum about 1920 and had declined by about half by the time of Bay Bridge operation. The SP seemed to prefer to have groups of their lines terminate at the same place. Three lines originally terminated at Thousand Oaks in Berkeley, two at 14th and Franklin in Oakland, and two at High St S. in Alameda. The IER had two lines terminate at Thousand Oaks and two lines at West Alameda. *Berkeley, California St Line - Thousand Oaks station at the intersection of Solano and Colusa Avenues (Colusa Wye) in Berkeley, via Colusa, Monterey, private right- of-way, California, Stanford to the upper platform of the Oakland 16th St Station, thence to Oakland Pier.

Alternate cars went around the Alameda loop in the opposite direction. Some service was to 14th and Franklin only. In December 1923, all service was cut back to the 14th and Franklin station. Terminated March 1926. * Mail trains - Starting in December 1923, mail trains, usually consisting of one box motor, loaded sacked mail several times a day at Oakland Pier and delivered it to Oakland 16th St Station and to Berkeley Station. Mail from Oakland Pier was also delivered to Alameda Station, using trains of cars being sent from Oakland Pier to the Alameda Shops for maintenance and repair. Terminated November 1938. Equipment Electrical power at 1200 volts DC was supplied by the SP's power plant on the east side of the Tidal Canal along Fruitvale Ave. Substations were at Thousand Oaks, West Oakland and the power plant. The trains and streetcars used pantographs to obtain electrical power from overhead catenary wires. The equipment was maintained at the Alameda Shops,Alameda shops located at West Alameda, on the Oakland Estuary. During bridge operation routine maintenance was performed at a shop in the Bridge Yards.Ford (1977), p. 245. The large steel cars, 73 ft. long, were moderately heavy in overall weight but low in weight per passenger due to their huge capacity 3-2 seating, giving a maximum of 116 passengers. At first they were painted in standard railroad olive green, but were soon painted a bright red and became known as the \\"red trains\\" or \\"big red cars\\". The first group of cars arrived in 1911 from the American Car and Foundry Company (ACF) and consisted of 40 powered passenger coaches (motors), 25 powered combination baggage-passenger cars (combos), and 50 unpowered passenger coaches (trailers), some with train controls and some without. They had large rectangular end windows, which proved to be a liability for train crews in accidents.Original train (combo, trailer, motor) in Alameda These windows were replaced by smaller, distinctive round windows, or \\"owl-eyes\\", similar to but larger than those of the Pennsylvania Railroad's MP54 cars, in all cars except for trailers without train controls, which could not be used at the ends of trains.IER car on Lincoln Ave. line at Bay St. station. The second group of cars arrived in 1912 from the Pullman Company and consisted of 10 motors, 4 combos, and 2 powered baggage-express cars (box motors), all with round end windows. The third group of cars arrived in 1924 from the St. Louis Car Company and consisted of 6 motors with round end windows, bringing the total number of cars for ferry-train service to 147. The usual operating practice was that the number of powered cars in a train was at least one more than the number of trailers. Trailers, with or without train controls, were always placed in the middle of trains; train controls on trailers were mainly used in assembling or disassembling trains. As ridership declined and trains became shorter, trailers were primarily used only during rush hour. Combos were used to carry checked baggage to and from main-line trains at Oakland Pier and to deliver bundled newspapers. They were usually put on the end of the train toward Oakland Pier, and most commonly on the 7th St Line as far as Havenscourt or Seminary Avenue. When plans for longer routes were not implemented,Demoro, Part 1, p. 40.Ford (1977), pp. 115, 123, map on p. 128. 21 of the ACF combos were changed to motors at the time they received their round end windows in the 1920s. Due to the heavy grades on the Bay Bridge, 10 trailers were changed to motors in 1938 when all the passenger-carrying cars were modified with automatic train control and other safety equipment for bridge operation.Ford (1977), pp. 250-251. The California Toll Bridge Authority (TBA) funded these changes and received title to 58 cars in return. All cars carried the name \\"Southern Pacific Lines\\" until Bay Bridge service began, when the IER-owned cars were repainted with \\"Interurban Electric Railway Company\\". In addition to the large cars already described, the SP took delivery in 1912 of 20 streetcars from the Pullman Company for its Oakland- Alameda streetcar line. In 1913 it found that they had too many of these cars so they shipped 10 of them to the Pacific Electric (PE).Swett (1964), pp. 84-85. By 1919 patronage had grown so the SP recalled two of the cars from PE. Aftermath Lines The rival Key System assumed rights to some of the trackage and overhead wires of abandoned IER/SP routes.Sappers (2007). This had first occurred due to the 1933 consolidation. In March 1933, the abandoned California St line in Berkeley from about Ada and California Sts, up Monterey Avenue to Colusa Ave, was used for the Key's Sacramento St Line (H line) until abandonment in July 1941. In April 1941, a portion of the abandoned 7th St, Dutton Ave Line in East Oakland, from East 14th St to Havenscourt Boulevard, was used to extend the Key's 12th St Line (A Line) until October 1950, when this line was cut back to 12th and Oak Sts. In August 1941, a portion of the Shattuck Ave line in Berkeley, from about Dwight Way to the south end of the Northbrae Tunnel was used to extend the Key's Shattuck Ave Line (F Line). In December 1942, the F Line was extended through the tunnel to the intersection of Solano Ave and The Alameda. The F Line was abandoned in April 1958. Key System streetcars also used the IER Shattuck Avenue tracks from Parker St to University Ave until abandonment in November 1948.Sappers (2007), pp. 175-176. During World War II the Key System used a portion of the 7th St, Dutton Ave Line tracks in Oakland on 7th St, from Broadway to Pine St, for streetcar serviceSappers (2007), pp. 114, 116, 120, 155, 168, 234. to a shipyard and most of the 9th St track of the 9th St Line for the Richmond Shipyard Railway. SP freight service continued over parts of the 9th St, Shattuck Ave, 7th St and Lincoln Ave Lines. An excursion train pulled by a steam locomotive was operated over this track in April 1954, by the Bay Area Electric Railroad Association.Ute & Singer, p. 125 By 1960, all except the part from the 9th St Line had been abandoned. The most noticeable remaining structures from the SP/IER lines are the Northbrae Tunnel, now used to extend Solano Ave eastwards, turning to the south to connect with Sutter St, and the Alameda shop building, now used by private businesses. Equipment After the SP streetcar line was abandoned in 1926, all 12 cars were sold to the Key System.Sappers (2007), pp. 440-441.Demoro, Part 2, p. 275. After IER service ended, the TBA separated its 58 cars from the SP's 89 cars. In 1942, the TBA sold 6 motors for scrap in JanuarySappers (1965). and the remaining 52 cars to the Houston Shop Corp., which shipped them via the SP to Houston. One of the TBA trailers was wrecked in transit, so the SP replaced it with one of its trailers. The SP sent the 2 box motors to the PE,Swett (October, 1965), pp. 572-573. in March and April used 5 trailers for buildings in West Oakland,Southern Pacific Co. records. and stored their remaining 81 cars until they were requisitioned in July and September by the United States Maritime Commission for use in transporting workers to World War II shipyards: 20 trailers to a line in the Portland, Oregon, area and 61 cars to the PE in Southern California where some of them were in use until that system ceased operations in 1961.Swett, (April 1965), pp. 388-409. Many cars were reassigned to other locales during World War II.Some of this information is known, some is not, and contradictory statements have been published on some points. A few of the cars have been preserved and can be seen and ridden at the Travel Town Museum in Los Angeles,LAMTA #1543 the Western Railway Museum in Rio Vista, California (in need of restoration), and the Orange Empire Railway Museum in Perris, California.

It has been open to the public since 1996. The Center, named after philanthropist-couple Jack H. Skirball and Audrey Skirball-Kenis, features a museum with regularly changing exhibitions, film events, music and theater performances, comedy, family, literary and cultural programs. The campus includes a museum, a performing arts center, conference halls, classrooms, libraries, courtyards, gardens, and a caf√©. Skirball Museum Skirball Museum The Skirball Museum predates the Skirball Cultural Center, having been established in 1972 at the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion in L.A. The Museum moved into the Skirball Cultural Center after the center's completion. The Skirball's core exhibition, Visions and Values: Jewish Life from Antiquity to America, traces the history, experiences and values of Jews over 4,000 years. Featuring changing displays of works from the Skirball's museum collection, the exhibition's galleries contain multimedia installations, rare artifacts, historical documents and photographs, works of fine art, interactive computer stations and sound recordings that lead visitors on the Jewish people's journey, culminating with their experiences in the United States. Comprising more than 30,000 objects, the Skirball's museum collection includes archaeological artifacts from biblical and later historical periods; Jewish ceremonial objects from countries all over the globe; an extensive group of Old World Jewish objects; the Project Americana collection, comprising objects that document the ‚Äúeveryday life of ordinary people‚Äù in the United States since the 1850s; and works of fine art in a variety of media. Architecture Taper Courtyard Designed by Israeli-born architect Moshe Safdie, the campus of the Skirball Cultural Center is in the Santa Monica Mountains. Noah's Ark The Noah's Ark galleries were designed by Olson Sundberg Kundig Allen Architects of Seattle. Partner Jim Olson was the lead designer of the ark and Principal Alan Maskin designed the interactive exhibits and provided art direction for the project, including the design of nearly 300 animals. Brooklyn-based designer/puppeteer Chris M. Green created additional life-sized animals, many of them puppets to be operated by gallery staff. Outdoors, the Noah's Ark experience includes a rainbow mist installation developed by Moshe Safdie, the architect of the Skirball Cultural Center, in partnership with environmental artist Ned Kahn. Public programs The Skirball presents a range of music, theater, poetry, literary, film and other performing arts. Education Education The Skirball annually serves approximately 60,000 schoolchildren and teachers representing virtually every religious and ethnic background in Southern California. The Skirball's school outreach programs in cultural history and performing arts draw visitors from all over the region. The family-oriented discovery center, which includes a simulated dig site and field tent, offers a look at the archaeology of ancient Israel and the Near East. Family programs take place regularly and attract new and returning visitors for entertainment and education. Highlights include toddler classes, children's concerts, art and music workshops, archaeological dig workshops, readings, summer camps and the annual Hanukkah Family Festival. The Learning for Life department offers adult education courses in comparative religion and culture, art, creative writing, literature and the American Jewish experience. Members and supporters The Skirball accomplishes its mission thanks to the generosity and active participation of thousands of individuals from all walks of life across the United States and abroad, including more than 7,000 members, volunteers and docents; foundations and corporations; and governmental funding agencies.

They came factory tuned to Drop B (B, F#, B, E, G#, C# [low to high]). They have a H-H configuration, or two humbucking pickups, and the fixed Edge FX bridge, which is based on Ibanez Edge tremolo but fixed, providing more tuning stability than a standard hard- tail. Contrary to popular belief, the MTM series guitars do not sport a tremolo bar or system. The MTM series was discontinued in 2016, when Mick Thomson switched to Jackson Guitars. Models RG shape (2006‚Äì2011) (2014‚Äì2016) ;MTM1 :The MTM1 is constructed with the neck-thru method, has a mahogany body, and a 5 piece maple/walnut neck. The neck is the wizard II neck and on the newer generations of the MTM1, it does not have the thumbstop behind the headstock. When the MTM1 was first released, it came out of the factory with active EMG Pickups: the 81 and 60. The 2nd generation MTM1's came with Seymour Duncan AHB-1 Blackouts and came in 2 colors; black with white binding, or the traditional blood red with black binding. The 3rd generation MTM1s were released with a few modifications from its predecessors. It featured a volute behind the headstock, the AHB-1 Blackouts were changed to Thomson's signature EMTY Blackouts, and the output jack was mounted on the side of the guitar, like that of an Ibanez JEM. The MTM1 is the more expensive model. The MTM1 also featured the \\"seven\\" inlay across the first five frets. ;MTM2 :The Ibanez MTM2 is the more affordable sister guitar of the MTM1, it has a mahogany body, bolt-on 5pc maple and walnut neck, locking nut, EDGE III Fixed bridge, and Duncan designed active pickups (earlier models shipped with Ibanez V7 and V8 pickups). The MTM2 was offered in black with white binding, and later white with black binding. The \\"seven\\" inlays were removed, and is now written on the Truss rod cover. ;MTM20 :Similar to the MTM2, the MTM20 has a mahogany body, 5pc Maple and Walnut bolt on neck, locking nut, FX Edge III bridge, and the Duncan Designed active pickups. However the 'seven' inlays normally featured on higher end models was present. The MTM20 comes only in white with black binding. The MTM20 also featured a volute on the headstock. Glaive shape (2012‚Äì2014) For 2012, Ibanez released new MTM models based on tests Mick had been using for the various tours since All Hope Is Gone. Based on Ibanez' Glaive shape, there are again two models; a high grade expensive model, and a medium grade model. ;MTM100 :The higher grade MTM100 comes only in black finish. It features the new Seymour Duncan EMTY active pickups. The 5 piece Wizard III maple/walnut neck-thru is squeezed between mahogany wings. The FX Edge III fixed bridge returns from the previous MTMs. This top of the line version returns the \\"seven\\" inlay at the first five frets. ;MTM10 :The MTM10, the lower grade of the new two, comes only in blood red finish. It also drops the \\"seven\\" inlay. Like the MTM2, it features a bolt-on 3 piece maple/mahogany Wizard III neck. As for the pickups, the EMTYs are dropped in favor of a less expensive model, the Duncan HB-105MT active humbuckers in neck, and bridge positions.

Early years Audrey Skirball-Kenis was born Audrey Marx in Birmingham, Alabama, the daughter of Otto Marx, Sr., and Agnes Mosler Marx. Her father's banking business was an early tenant of the eponymous Brown Marx Building in downtown Birmingham, Alabama. Although raised in New York City, as the daughter of a Paris-born mother, she spoke French at home until she began school. In 1941, the day after Pearl Harbor was bombed, Audrey moved to California to join the Signal Corps. Audrey had two brief marriages that ended in divorce before marrying film producer and real estate developer Jack Skirball. The couple were deeply involved in philanthropy, largely in support of Reform Judaism. They planned and funded the construction of the Skirball Cultural Center. Jack died in 1985, shortly before the Center opened. In 1987 Audrey married wine importer Charles Kenis. Together they established the Audrey Skirball-Kenis Center for Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at Cedars- Sinai Medical Center, as well as being involved in a variety of other philanthropic projects. A long-time horse racing fan, Audrey Skirball had joined with friends in 1972 to purchase a thoroughbred, then established the 3 Plus U Stable, which became quite successful. Charles Kenis joined his new wife in this pursuit and became a founder and eventually director emeritus of the Thoroughbred Owners of California.Article in the Thoroughbred Times ASK Audrey and Charles founded the non-profit Audrey Skirball-Kenis Theater Projects (ASK) in West Los Angeles. Audrey did not actively manage ASK, but Charles served as president of ASK's board of trustees. In 1990, Audrey and Charles, through ASK, made a highly publicized donation of $500,000 to the Los Angeles Arts Festival's theater and performance programs. The donation saved the festival from closing, and was ceremonially accepted in the Los Angeles mayor's office by Peter Sellers, the festival's director.

It orbits the Sun between Saturn and Uranus, grazing the orbit of Uranus. On 26 March 2014, astronomers announced the discovery of two rings (nicknamed as the rivers Oiapoque and Chu√≠) around Chariklo by observing a stellar occultation, making it the first minor planet known to have rings. Chariklo was discovered by James V. Scotti of the Spacewatch program on February 15, 1997. Chariklo is named after the nymph Chariclo ('), the wife of Chiron and the daughter of Apollo. A photometric study in 2001 was unable to find a definite period of rotation. Infrared observations of Chariklo indicate the presence of water ice, which may in fact be located in its rings. Michael Brown's website lists it as possibly a dwarf planet with a measured diameter of 232 km.  Size and shape Chariklo is currently the largest known centaur, with an equivalent diameter of 252 km. Its shape is probably elongated with dimensions 296 √ó 264 √ó 204 km. is likely to be the second largest with and 2060 Chiron is likely to be the third largest with . The lost centaur may be even larger, with an estimated diameter close to .  Orbit  Centaurs originated in the Kuiper belt and are in dynamically unstable orbits that will lead to ejection from the Solar System, an impact with a planet or the Sun, or transition into a short-period comet. The orbit of Chariklo is more stable than those of Nessus, Chiron, and Pholus. Chariklo lies within 0.09 AU of the 4:3 resonance of Uranus and is estimated to have a relatively long orbital half-life of about 10.3 Myr. Orbital simulations of twenty clones of Chariklo suggest that Chariklo will not start to regularly come within 3 AU (450 Gm) of Uranus for about thirty thousand years. During the perihelic oppositions of 2003‚Äì04, Chariklo had an apparent magnitude of +17.7. , Chariklo was 14.8 AU from the Sun. Chariklo orbits within 0.09 AU of the 4:3 mean-motion resonance with Uranus.  Rings  An artist's rendering of Chariklo with its rings Artist's impression of the surface of Chariklo and its rings. A stellar occultation in 2013 revealed that Chariklo has two rings with radii 396 and 405 km and widths of about 7 km and 3.5 km respectively. The rings are approximately 9 km apart. This makes Chariklo the smallest known object to have rings. These rings are consistent with an edge-on orientation in 2008, which can explain Chariklo's dimming before 2008 and brightening since. Nonetheless, the elongated shape of Chariklo explains most of the brightness variability resulting in darker rings than previously determined. Furthermore, the rings can explain the gradual disappearance of the water-ice features in Chariklo's spectrum before 2008 and their reappearance thereafter if the water ice is in Chariklo's rings. The existence of a ring system around a minor planet was unexpected because it had been thought that rings could only be stable around much more massive bodies. Ring systems around minor bodies had not previously been discovered despite the search for them through direct imaging and stellar occultation techniques. Chariklo's rings should disperse over a period of at most a few million years, so either they are very young, or they are actively contained by shepherd moons with a mass comparable to that of the rings. However, other research suggests that Chariklo's elongated shape combined with its fast rotation can clear material in an equatorial disk through Lindblad resonances and explain the survival and location of the rings, a mechanism valid also for the ring of Haumea. The team nicknamed the rings Oiapoque (the inner, more substantial ring) and Chu√≠ (the outer ring), after the two rivers that form the northern and southern coastal borders of Brazil. A request for formal names will be submitted to the IAU at a later date. It has been speculated that 2060 Chiron may have a similar pair of rings. Exploration Camilla is a mission concept published in June 2018 that would launch a robotic probe to perform a single flyby of Chariklo and drop off a impactor made of tungsten to excavate a crater approximately deep for remote compositional analysis during the flyby. The mission would be designed to fit under the cost cap of NASA New Frontiers program, although it has not been formally proposed to compete for funding.

He served two non-consecutive terms as the 34th Governor of Georgia, the first from 1829 to 1831 and the second from 1837 to 1839. He also served multiple terms in the United States House of Representatives. Early life Gilmer was born near Lexington, Georgia, in what is present day Oglethorpe County (Wilkes County at the time of his birth). He attended a variety of backwood schools, including Moses Waddell's famous Willington Academy. He served as first lieutenant in the Forty-third Infantry Regiment from 1813 to 1815 in the campaign against the Creek during the War of 1812. He practiced law as a profession. Political career Gilmer's career consisted of multiple, alternating, elected positions at the state and federal level. Of the two great Georgia political factions known as the Crawford men and the Clarke men, he favored Crawford. He was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives in 1818, 1819, and 1824. Gilmer was also elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1820, 1826, 1828 and 1832. Due to an oversight, he did not serve after the election in 1828, because he failed to accept the position within the legal time frame and the governor ordered a new election. As governor of Georgia, Gilmer aggressively pursued Indian removal, laying claim to Federal assistance promised by the Compact of 1802. He initiated the prosecution of Cherokee missionary Samuel Austin Worcester for violation of a law requiring all white persons residing within the Cherokee nation to obtain a license from the governor and to swear to uphold the laws of Georgia. Worcester was arrested in 1831 and sentenced to four years' hard labor. The Cherokee Nation hired a lawyer, William Wirt, and sued the state of Georgia in Cherokee Nation v. Georgia. This led to the United States Supreme Court decision Worcester v. Georgia, which struck down the Georgia statute imposing its laws on the Cherokees as violating the Treaty of Hopewell. Backed by the Georgia militia and Governor Gilmer, the General Assembly dissolved the Cherokee government, annulled its laws, and passed an act authorizing Gilmer to take possession of the Cherokee lands in north Georgia. The Cherokee issue was hotly debated in the gubernatorial campaign of 1831. Gilmer lost the election to Wilson Lumpkin. The state seized Cherokee gold mines and set up a land lottery system in 1832 to distribute Cherokee lands. During his second term as Governor of Georgia, beginning in 1837, Gilmer supported and expedited the Federal government in the final removal of Indians from Georgia . This process came to be termed the Trail of Tears. Death and legacy Gilmer died in 1859 in Lexington and is buried in the Presbyterian Church Cemetery in the same city. Gilmer County, Georgia is named for him.

Bayer had been working in Saint Petersburg to develop a method to provide alumina to the textile industry that used it as a fixing agent in the dyeing of cotton. In 1887, he discovered that aluminium hydroxide precipitated from an alkaline solution which is crystalline and can be filtered and washed more easily than that precipitated from an acid medium by neutralization. In 1888, Bayer developed and patented his four-stage process of extracting alumina from bauxite ore. In the mid-19th-century, aluminium was so precious that a bar of the metal was exhibited alongside the French Crown Jewels at the Exposition Universelle in Paris 1855. Along with the Hall‚ÄìH√©roult process, Bayer's solution caused the price of aluminium to drop about 80% in 1890 from what it had been in 1854.  Personal life and education  Carl Bayer was born (March 4, 1847) in the Duchy of Upper and Lower Silesia in the Austrian Empire, which is now Poland. He attended Heidelberg University in Germany where he studied chemistry under Robert Bunsen from 1869-1871, the namesake of the Bunsen burner. At Heidelberg, Bayer received his doctorate degree in 1871 with a dissertation on the chemistry of indium which was discovered recently in 1863. After obtaining his doctorate, Bayer lectured for two years at Technische Hochschule in Brno, and then left to establish his own research company. Bayer then moved to St. Petersburg in 1885 where he flourished as an inventor. At age 45 he married the daughter of a Russian politician, Alma Von Witte and settled in Rietzdorf (modern day Reƒçica ob Paki, Slovenia). Together they had six children, and in 1904 at the age of 57, Bayer died. His wife would survive him until 1962, when she died at the age of 94.  Aluminum ore processing prior to Bayer  Bauxite was discovered in 1821 by Pierre Berthier and named it after a village named Les Beaux where he found it. To obtain the alumina from the bauxite ore, a process was developed that used acid to dissolve aluminium but resulted in a product that contained large amounts of iron and titanium dissolved within which were difficult to remove. Due to these impurities, the process was not employed for use, but was an approach that was explored. Louis Le Chatelier, in 1855, created a process that produced aluminium hydroxide by heating in sodium carbonate and then leaching. Bubbling through the solution with carbon dioxide precipitated aluminium hydroxide, which when dried, allowed for the recovery of alumina.  Bayer's contribution to aluminium ore processing  Bayer worked in the textile industry in Saint Petersburg, where aluminium hydroxide was used to help affix dye to the cotton. While working he made two important discoveries regarding processing steps that helped separate the Bayer process from that of Le Chatelier. In 1887, Bayer found that by using a pure seed of aluminium hydroxide, a crystalline precipitate formed that was more economical than that obtained by Le Chatelier. He later patented his discovery in Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom in 1887. In 1892, Bayer discovered that by using an autoclave, or a pressure leaching vessel, in combination with an sodium hydroxide leachant the process resulted in a very pure sodium aluminate solution that could be used for his precipitation step that he discovered previously. Both steps are widely used today but have been improved upon as technology has evolved. After discovery, Bayer worked as a startup consultant for alumina manufacturing around Europe. Bayer returned to Austria in 1894 to start an alumina factory but was unable to secure enough capital to fully fund the project. Importance to the aluminium industry Alumina and aluminium production underwent significant changes in processing due to discoveries made by Karl Bayer, Charles Martin Hall, and Paul H√©roult. Hall and Heroult share credit for inventing aluminium electrolysis. The Hall‚ÄìHeroult method is the primary method of producing modern aluminium and requires high purity alumina to produce aluminium. The Bayer process produces high purity alumina which is then used in the Hall‚ÄìHeroult process as the main raw material. In 1900, aluminium was valued at the equivalent of 100 current US dollars, but over the next 50 years decreased in price to approximately 20 current US dollars. This decrease is attributed to the increase in the ease of manufacturing associated with aluminium after Bayer, Hall, and Heroult‚Äôs discoveries.

Labrador did not successfully advance his country's diplomatic goals at the conference. These goals included restoring the Bourbons (who had been deposed by Napoleon) to the thrones of Spain's old Italian possessions, and reestablishing control over Spanish South American colonies, which had risen in revolt during the Napoleonic invasion of Spain. The Marquis of Labrador is almost universally condemned by historians for his incompetence at the Congress. One standard Spanish history textbook condemns him for \\"...his mediocrity, his haughty character, and his total subordination to the whims of the king's inner circle, by which he achieved nothing favorable.\\" Paul Johnson calls him \\"a caricature Spaniard who specialized in frantic rages, haughty silences and maladroit demarches.\\" Labrador was born in Valencia de Alc√°ntara, and studied at the traditionally conservative University of Salamanca. He received a bachelor's degree in law at the age of twenty-seven and an advanced degree four years later, and was named a judge on the Audiencia of Seville in 1793. In August 1798, Labrador was sent as charg√© d'affaires in Florence by Charles IV of Spain to accompany Pius VI (r.1775-1799) in exile, when this pontiff was forced to become a prisoner of the French, following his refusal to surrender his temporal sovereignty to the French armies commanded by General Louis Alexandre Berthier. At the death of Pius VI, Labrador was named Minister Plenipotentiary to the Papal States, and later served at Florence, capital of the Napoleonic Kingdom of Etruria. The liberal deputies of the national assembly based in C√°diz (1810‚Äì1813) took him to be one of their own, and gave him the vital post of Minister of State, a decision they would quickly regret: \\"[Labrador was] dim, prolix, of pride and arrogance that trod the limits of fatuity, and of peculiar pedantry.\\" But he was no liberal. He assisted Ferdinand VII in abolishing the liberal constitution of 1812, and was awarded with the duty of representing Spain at the peace conferences of Paris and Vienna, with the full rank and title of Ambassador. The Congress of Vienna. The Marquis of Labrador is seated at the round table, third from the right of the diplomats who are seated. At the Congress, the Marquis of Labrador was outmaneuvered by experienced diplomats such as Talleyrand and Metternich. Labrador's entreaties on behalf of the devolution of the former Spanish possession of Louisiana from the United States were roundly ignored. The Austrians blocked plans that would have made Spain a special ally of the Holy See; the British likewise rejected Spain's territorial claims against Portugal. The British particularly were exasperated with their Spanish ally and her representative. \\"It is somewhat singular in itself,\\" Castlereagh would write, \\"that the only two Courts with which we find it difficult to do business are those of the Peninsula.\\" In his opinion of Labrador, the Duke of Wellington, Castlereagh's replacement at Vienna and an experienced judge of truculent hidalgos, was more direct: \\"The most stupid man I ever came across.\\" Labrador was a man, according to the Spanish Minister of State Jos√© Garc√≠a de Le√≥n y Pizarro \\"...of little amiability [and of] few or no dinners or gatherings.\\" And in this apogee of drawing-room diplomacy, this was fatal. Labrador could in fact rely neither on his choleric personality to repair any relations, personal or diplomatic, nor on a salary that his cash-strapped government never paid him, to arrange any social gatherings at his residence on the Minoritten Platz, the Palais P√°lffy. \\"He did not even figure,\\" his biographer assures us, \\"as a protagonist in any of the many amorous adventures [that occurred during the Congress]\\"; the most exciting social event Labrador seems to have attended was a wax figures production in the Christmastide of 1814. Spain did not sign the Final Act of the Congress of June 9, 1815, for Labrador's proposal to attach reservations to the act concerning the rights of the Italian Bourbons was soundly disregarded. Labrador registered a protest against several of the Congress resolutions, including that concerning the restitution of Olivenza. With only the restoration of picayune Lucca as a Bourbon-Parma duchy to show for her efforts, and represented by a man overwhelmed with his charge (\\"I must have the face of a favorite aunt [for] everyone is coming to me with their troubles\\"), Spain's status as a second- rate power was confirmed. Spain finally accepted the treaty on 7 May 1817. Labrador's long life ended tragically: he would eventually lose his position in the diplomatic service, his wife, his sight, his judgment, and his fortune. High street fashion designer Hannah Sharpe has named a clothing range after Labrador. The range has a 19th-century Spanish influence called simply el Marquis de Labrador.

Although the party has been in the minority for most of the state's history, it has produced several notable public figures, including the late U.S. Senator Frank Church and former governor and Secretary of the Interior Cecil Andrus. Democratic strength in Idaho is concentrated in Blaine County and Pocatello, as well as parts of Boise and the Idaho Panhandle region. Trade union support has traditionally been a key component of Democratic success in Idaho. Recent former party chairs include Richard Stallings, a former member of the United States House of Representatives from Idaho, Hailey attorney R.

(accessed 15 August 2015) He served until March 2019. Evangeline Beechler was elected Chair in March 2019. In 2008, the Idaho Democratic Party won its first congressional race in 16 years, when Walt Minnick defeated Republican incumbent Bill Sali in the state's First Congressional District. The party currently does not hold any major seats at the state or federal level. History Created in 1863 after the discovery of new mining territory, the early Idaho Territory was heavily populated by settlers from western Oregon, California and Nevada who supported a radical Republican agenda. However, towards the end of the war, Idaho became flooded with Confederate refugees from states like Missouri who voted, like the miners in Idaho, heavily Democratic. So much so that the state became a Democratic stronghold for the next two decades. At the dawn of statehood, despite ceding Idaho almost entirely four years earlier to the Populists and Republicans (Cleveland won only 2 popular votes in 1892), a fusion Populist/Democratic ticket behind William Jennings Bryan's candidacy won the state with 78.1% of the vote with the support from Silver Republicans. Nevertheless, the three-man congressional delegation remained 2-part Populist, 1-part Republican. It wasn't until the turn of the century that Idaho saw its first Democratic representation in Congress, Senator Fred Dubois, U.S. Marshal of the Idaho Territory and a former Republican. He successfully campaigned on the disenfranchisement of Mormons on the grounds that they broke the law by practicing polygamy, already having barred them form holding office while he held office in the state legislature. Ironically, while his anti-Mormonism as a Republican kept Democrats out of office after 1882, his anti-Mormonism as a Democrat had the same result after 1902. Though Democrats and Jewish governor Moses Alexander were able to implement a radically progressive agenda with the backing of the Non-Partisan League while in control during Woodrow Wilson's presidency, they quickly ceded power and it wasn't until Franklin Delano Roosevelt's 1932 landslide that they began to turn out state and local (as well as national) Republican office holders for a sustained period of time. That year, all three congressional Republicans up for re-election were defeated by Democratic challengers by at least 11 percent. All three challengers, like their state party, were stalwart supporters of FDR's New Deal. Despite a turn of opinion against the federal government's programs years later, Democrats retained two of their three newly attained seats for at least 15 years and managed to control the legislature for eight until the chambers evened themselves out during and immediately after the war. In the post-war decades, as state politics was professionalized, Republicans dominated the state legislature and the governor's mansion, but Democrats maintained a steadfast presence across all other executive offices. A platform of environmental concerns gave Idaho its last Democratic governor to date even as it became more conservative in its congressional delegation and state legislature. However, in the 1970s and 1980s, Democrats lost two key voting groups. After the national party adopted a host of liberal social issues like abortion rights and feminism, Mormons left the party in droves. Meanwhile, unions lost influence in already declining mining and timber industries. Since 1994, when 4-term Democratic governor Cecil Andrus retired and Representative Larry LaRocco was defeated, only one member of the party, Walt Minnick, has won either statewide office or election to Congress. He was subsequently defeated by Republican Raul Labrador two years later. Idaho Democrats currently seat only 9 members of the House and 6 members of the Senate, slightly worse than the ~20% they held in each chamber in 1996 when the party first collapsed. Unlike with other Mountain West states, Nevada and Colorado among them, immigration has not shift Idaho leftward. Rather, Californians and other West Coast residents who have moved there have done so largely for cultural instead of economic reasons.

It was built in the early 19th century, and its total length as built was 385 km with 238 locks. History Brittany started developing its waterway network in 1538 when it decided to improve navigation on the River Vilaine. The project for a canal throughout the province was conceived by an 'inland navigation commission' convened in 1783. When Brest was blockaded by the English fleet Napoleon decided to build the canal to provide a safe inland link between the two largest military ports of the French Atlantic front. Building started in 1811, and Napoleon III presided over the canal's opening in 1858. This was the most ambitious canal project ever completed in France, 360km long with 238 locks. The canal was closed as a through route in 1920, when a section was submerged by Guerl√©dan dam (PK 227), a short distance west of the junction with the canalised river Blavet at Pontivy. The entire length of waterway west of Guerl√©dan was officially closed in 1957, and the 21km length from Pontivy to Guerl√©dan also subsequently fell into disuse. At the same time, the disappearance of all commercial traffic (in 26m long barges carrying up to 140 tonnes) resulted in the gradual silting up of the canal section between Rohan and Pontivy. The canal has been revived and ownership has been transferred from the State to Brittany Region, except for the short length in Pays de la Loire region.  Navigation  Navigation is no longer possible between Pontivy and Goariva. Guerl√©dan reservoir flooded the canal over a length of 10 km including 17 locks. However, a length of 15 km with 10 locks has been restored upstream of Guerl√©dan reservoir to the heritage site of La Piti√© Chapel, creating a navigation 25 km long, and a public consultation was held in 2017 with a view to lifting the ban on thermal engines on this section. Three separate navigable sections are thus presented in the route below.

He belonged to the literary group called the Hussards. He was also a sports columnist in L'√âquipe. Blondin also wrote under the name Tenorio. Biography Blondin was the son of a poet, Germaine Blondin, whose name he took, and of a printer's proof-reader. He earned a degree in philosophy the Sorbonne after studying at the Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand in Paris and the Lyc√©e Pierre Corneille in Rouen.Lyc√©e Pierre Corneille de Rouen - History He became very close to Roland Laudenbach during World War II. He was sent to Germany in 1942 for compulsory war work during the German occupation of World War II.Encres Vagabondes - Memoire of Antoine Blondin by par Claude Chanaud The experience inspired his first novel, L'Europe buissonni√®re,La Table Ronde, Paris which appeared in 1949. It won the Prix des Deux Magots, named after a literary caf√© in Paris, and brought him the friendship of authors such as Marcel Aym√© and Roger Nimier and the philosopher, Jean-Paul Sartre. In 1953, the young critic Bernard Frank dubbed the novelists Roger Nimier, Jacques Laurent, and Blondin as \\"les Hussards,\\" a title which stuck. The Hussars were characterized by their shared right-wing literary heritage, youthful irreverence towards leftist intellectuals, and a commitment to \\"art for art's sake.\\" Blondin's right-wing leanings did not, however, prevent a friendship with the socialist Fran√ßois Mitterrand, for whom he later came to vote.L'Humanite - Sports- 17 July 2003 - Profile of Blondin - Chronicler of the Tour His next novels, Les Enfants du bon Dieu and L'Humeur vagabonde confirmed a distinctive style which critics placed between Stendhal and Jules Renard. Turns of phrase such as \\"After the second world war, the trains started moving again. I profited from that by leaving my wife and children\\" and \\"I have stayed very thin, and so has my body of work,\\" are exemplary of Blondin's affinity for wordplay and humor. The themes of friendship, bohemianism, and the historical shock of World War II also held a prominent place in his fiction. After publishing the well-received novel \\"Un Singe en hiver\\", Blondin remained an active journalist, but the death of his best friend Roger Nimier prompted him to largely abandon writing fiction for over a decade. Nonetheless, he won the 1977 Prix Goncourt de la Nouvelle for the short story collection Quat'saisons. Blondin wrote press columns supporting the right in politics. He was a monarchist and wrote for monarchist publications such as Aspects de la France, La Nation Fran√ßaise and Rivarol. Although he was associated with Action Fran√ßaise intellectuals and the Maurrassian right during the beginning of his career, he distanced himself from politics later in his life. He also wrote sports features for L'√âquipe, for which he covered 27 editions of the Tour de France and seven Olympic Games. The Tour de France winner, Bernard Hinault, said: :He never interviews anybody but just records his impressions of what he's seen and what he feels. Sometimes Ren√© FalletFrench novelist, 1927-1983) was with him. They both love the Tour and, in simple language, they turn it into a modern epic, a troubador's song, a crusade, as they describe its beauty. The most banal event becomes significant to Blondin; he has only to see it and write about it. He raised the status of the Tour by giving it his own cachet; it became a myth to be renewed every year. No matter how predictable the race, he could maintain the interest in it.Hinault, Bernard (1989), Memories of the Peloton, Springfield, UK Blondin was a bon vivant known for heavy drinking in the Parisian district of Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s, playing at bull-fighting with passing cars and racking up numerous arrests for drunkenness. He chronicled this aspect of his life in the autofictional novel, Monsieur Jadis ou L'√âcole du Soir. He was frequently pursued for unpaid taxes. Pierre Chany said: :He really did owe a lot and, frankly, his situation was becoming serious; we even wondered if he wasn't going to prison. Faced with that, his friends called Ma√Ætre BertrandJacques Bertrand, a Parisian barrister known for his work for sportsmen to the rescue. Bertrand managed to organise a summit meeting with the general inspector of taxes - the highest man in his profession, the equivalent of a minister. Full of good will, this man said: :\\"Alors, M. Blondin, I understand that you want to come to terms...\\" :\\"Let's come to terms!\\" Antoine said coldly. :\\"How much would you be able to put into your account?\\" :\\"A tear, monsieur...\\" Naturally, the man threw him out. It was poor Fran√ßoiseBlondin's second wife who had to make another interview to sort it out.Penot, Christophe (1996), Pierre Chany, l'homme aux 50 Tours de France, Cristel, France A literary prize, for the best sports article, is awarded in his name.Prix Litteraire - The Antoine Blondine Prize References Category:1922 births Category:1991 deaths Category:Writers from Paris Category:French journalists Category:People affiliated with Action Fran√ßaise Category:Cycling journalists Category:Tour de France journalists Category:Cycling in France Category:Prix des Deux Magots winners Category:Prix Goncourt de la nouvelle recipients Category:Prix Interalli√© winners Category:Lyc√©e Pierre-Corneille alumni Category:Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand alumni Category:Burials at P√®re Lachaise Cemetery Category:20th-century French novelists Category:20th-century French male writers Category:French male novelists Category:French male non-fiction writers Category:20th-century journalists ","title":"Antoine Blondin"},{"id":"4243124","text":"Oude Meer is a hamlet in the Dutch province of North Holland.

It is a body contact lake, swimming, fishing, SUP and boating allowed, located south of the Conejo Valley and city of Thousand Oaks, and west of Westlake Village. The lake is naturally fed by thousand of acres of open-space, watershed mountains and natural springs. While homes have been around the lake since the reservoir was created in 1901, the community expanded with the construction of the Sherwood Country Club golf course surrounded by luxury homes. The ZIP Code is 91361, and the community is inside area code 805. The population was 1,527 at the 2010 census. For statistical purposes, the United States Census Bureau has defined Lake Sherwood as a census-designated place (CDP). The census definition of the area may not precisely correspond to local understanding of the area with the same name. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP covers an area of 3.3 square miles (8.6 km2), 3.1 square miles (8.1 km2) of it is land and 0.2 square miles (0.5 km2) of it (5.65%) is water.

Education The area is served by the Conejo Valley Unified School District. Students attend Westlake Elementary, Colina Middle School, and Westlake High School. Notable people Among the notable residents are hockey great Wayne Gretzky, who lived in a Georgian-style estate designed by fellow Canadian, Richard Landry. Gretzky sold the estate in 2007 for 18.5 million to another sports-star, baseball's Lenny Dykstra and moved to a slightly less extravagant mansion in the community. Since then, Dykstra's financial and legal problems forced him to sell the estate to a private individual and move away from the community. Dykstra declared bankruptcy, causing him to lose the property to foreclosure and in 2018 Gretzky repurchased the same property that he previously sold to Dykstra. Singer Paul Anka moved to Lake Sherwood in 2007 and owns multiple properties in the exclusive neighborhood. Tom Petty lived in a lakefront retreat that was originally built in 1931. Producer/Author/Journalist Larry Garrison resides with his wife. The tennis legend Pete Sampras and his wife, actress Bridgette Wilson, built a very large, modern, hilltop estate they have since moved from the house. Britney Spears moved to the community in 2011 but recently moved into nearby Hidden Valley. Many other famous inhabitants own property in the community, however, they are only part-time residents and use their estates as a second home or as a retreat. Sylvester Stallone owned a lakefront hideaway that was featured in the film American Pie. Also, William Randolph Hearst, who was one of the first famous residents in the area and owned property around the lake, used his estate as a vacation getaway during the 1920s and 1930s.

Motion Picture & Television location Lake Sherwood lies just west of several major movie ranches and has frequently been used as a filming location for television shows like The Dukes of Hazzard, The Rockford Files, and Little House on the Prairie. Lake Sherwood was named from being the location for Sherwood Forest in the 1922 film, Robin Hood, starring Douglas Fairbanks.

It has an enrollment of about 1,200 students and is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. History Wisconsin Lutheran College opened in the fall of 1973 with a part-time faculty and two dozen students. The school had its first full-time president two years later. In 1977 the school purchased five buildings on an campus, and had a set of plans that allowed for growth and development. In 1982, the college purchased the academic library from Milton College. Volunteers moved and installed this 60,000 volume library. In 1983, the college purchased and installed the science laboratory furnishings of the University of Wisconsin Center at Medford. These major additions helped the college pursue its dream of becoming a four-year college. In 1984, the Board of Regents approved the four-year program to start in the fall of 1985. The evaluation team from North Central Association of Colleges and Schools agreed that the necessary planning and resources existed to enable Wisconsin Lutheran College to move toward accreditation as a baccalaureate degree-granting institution. In May 1987 the first 12 students graduated with baccalaureate degrees. In June 1987 the Executive Commissioners of the North Central Association granted Wisconsin Lutheran College initial accreditation as a baccalaureate degree-granting institution. Gary Greenfield, who served as the college's first full-time president for 28 years, retired in June 2003. Timothy Kriewall was inaugurated as the second president on Sept. 7, 2003, and retired in June 2008. Daniel Johnson accepted the call to be the third full-time president of Wisconsin Lutheran College in July 2008 and was inaugurated on April 24, 2009. Campus The Gary J. Greenfield Administration Building The Wisconsin Lutheran College campus consists of the Gary J. Greenfield Administration Building, the Campus Center, the Center for Arts and Performance, the Marvin M. Schwan Library building, the Science Hall (renamed Generac Hall in May 2011), a recreational center, two dormitories, and several apartment buildings near campus owned by the school. The Gary J. Greenfield Administration Building was built in the 1880s under the supervision of Milwaukee architect, Alexander Eschweiler. It served as the home of a Catholic boys', then girls' school for many years until it was bought by Wisconsin Lutheran College in the early 1970s. Campus construction In September, 1987, construction began on the first building erected on campus. One year later, on Sept. 10, 1988, the Marvin M. Schwan Library was completed and dedicated. In July 1991, after two years of negotiation with the city of Wauwatosa, construction began on the college's second building, the Recreation Complex, which was dedicated on September 12, 1992. A third building, the Center for Arts and Performance, was completed in 1996, and the Campus Center was finished and dedicated in 1998. Two residence halls were constructed and dedicated on September 9, 2000. After two years of additional negotiation with the city of Wauwatosa and neighbors, construction began on Science Hall, which was dedicated on September 11, 2004. In February 2004 the college purchased of land in the northwest quadrant of the Milwaukee County Grounds as a site for its new outdoor athletic complex. Warrior Fields was dedicated on September 10, 2005. Rankings WLC was ranked 12th in the U.S. on Washington Monthly's 2013 Best Bang for the Buck Rankings for liberal arts colleges. In 2013, WLC ranked 12th in the nation on CBS MoneyWatch's list of U.S. colleges with the best professors.

He is most famous for the development of the Pringle manoeuvre, a technique still used in surgery today. Early life He was the only son of George Hogarth Pringle (1830‚Äì1871) a well known surgeon in Parramatta, New South Wales, Australia. Before emigrating to Australia George Hogarth Pringle had worked in Edinburgh with Joseph Lister and had been responsible for the introduction of antiseptic surgical practice into Australia. After his father died in 1872, James returned to Britain to school at Sedbergh in Cumberland and from there entered the University of Edinburgh Medical School to study medicine, graduating in 1885. After graduation he was able travel to Europe to study surgical practice at Hamburg, Berlin and Vienna. This visit to European centres was to prove important because he maintained links particularly with German, Austrian and Swiss surgeons, keeping up to date with their literature.Power, D and Le Fanu, W R. Lives of the Fellows of the Royal College of Surgeons of England 1930‚Äì1951. London: Royal College of Surgeons of England, 1953, pp. 649‚Äì651 He had training in ophthalmology at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London before becoming house surgeon under Professor Thomas Annandale (1838‚Äì1907) in Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, and then house surgeon under Sir William Macewen (1848‚Äì1924) in Glasgow Royal Infirmary. In 1892, he became a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of England (FRCSEng) and was appointed Surgeon to Glasgow Royal Infirmary in 1896. He became a Fellow of the Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow in 1899. Supporter of women in medicine Pringle and Sir William Macewen were among the few senior figures in medicine at that time who were sympathetic to women in medicine, readily accepting women students into their clinics. Some of these were to become well known figures in later life including Louise McIlroy (1874‚Äì1968), Elsie Inglis (1864‚Äì1917), and Helen Wingate (1895‚Äì1985). In 1899, Pringle was appointed Lecturer in Surgery and Demonstrator in Anatomy to Queen Margaret College which had been established for women students and opened in 1868 and began to teach women medical students in 1890‚Äì91. Fracture treatment Pringle made a particular study of the treatment of fractures, where he was at an advantage because X-rays had been introduced very early into clinical practice in Glasgow Royal Infirmary, an innovation that allowed Pringle to gain wide personal experience of fractures and their management. His colleague John Macintyre (1857‚Äì1928) had established the world's first x-ray service for patients in Glasgow Royal Infirmary in March 1896. This allowed James Hogarth Pringle an early, perhaps unique experience in fracture diagnosis and management using x-rays, and formed the basis for his book on fractures and their treatment.Pringle, J Hogarth (1910). Oxford Medical Publications. Fractures and their treatment. London. Hodder and Stoughton. He had the added advantage of working in the hospital where Joseph Lister had first introduced antisepsis and would surely have been aware of his own father's work on antisepsis in introducing Listerian antisepsis into Australia. He was, like Sir William Macewen, an early exponent of aseptic technique in surgery. Both of these factors undoubtedly contributed to his expertise and success with fracture management. He was a pioneer of treating fractures by fixation and had impressive results with an amputation rate for sepsis of only 2.6%, a dramatic reduction on the norm for the time. ‚ÄúThere are few cases,\\" he wrote, \\" which afford a better test of aseptic methods.\\" But it was his policy of fixation of long fractures in an age when treatment by traction was the norm that marked him out as a pioneer. \\"... In every case,\\" he wrote, \\"I have employed some form of 'fixation' of the bone fragments; the 'fixation' being effected in some instances by wiring the main fragments, in others by the use of 'plates' and in others generally in the case of a small fragment (e.g. a portion of an articular surface) which has been fractured off and the use of a screw to fix the small to the large segment of the bone.\\" In 1910, he published Fractures and their Treatment, a textbook which became a standard and authoritative work on fracture treatment for more than a generation.Pringle J Hogarth. Oxford Medical Publications. Fractures and their treatment. London. Hodder and Stoughton. 1910 Hindquarter amputation He was also a pioneer of hindquarter amputation, a radical operation involving division of the pubic symphysis and the sacroiliac joint, performing the first successful such amputation in Britain in 1900 for tuberculosis of the hip which had spread to the pelvis. He was the first in the world to perform the one stage procedure for sarcoma of the thigh. The size and relative success of Pringle's series may be judged by comparison with the subsequent experience of Sir Gordon Gordon-Taylor, widely regarded as a pioneer of the technique, who was generous in his praise of Pringle's technique and results. Head injury Pringle developed expertise in head injury, working as assistant to Macewen, a pioneer of neurosurgery. Pringle's casebooks demonstrate the standard skull charts he devised for the recording of head injuries and the precise site and extent of skull fractures.Pringle, James Hogarth (1863‚Äì1941), surgeon. Archive. Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow ref. 250 RCPSG 33 In these casebooks he recorded the levels of consciousness, meticulous neurological examinations and fundoscopy which he had performed in such cases. These casebooks, neatly written and with meticulous coloured illustrations, offer an insight into the mind of a surgeon who was both painstaking and methodical. Malignant melanoma In 1908, Pringle published the first description of en-bloc excision for malignant melanoma, reporting the procedure in two patients. Some thirty years later he was able to publish a follow-up reporting two of these cases alive and well, 30 and 38 years on. His description of en-block excision is much as is practised today and appears to be the first description of what was to become an accepted surgical treatment. Reconstructive arterial surgery Pringle was the first surgeon in Britain to carry out a free vein graft. He did this using a saphenous vein graft to restore continuity after excision of a syphilitic aneurysm of the popliteal artery and characteristically in this paper he duly acknowledged the \\"splendid work of Carrel\\". Alexis Carrel had been the first surgeon to make an arterial anastomosis, work which led to his being awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1912. The technical quality of Pringle's operative technique is demonstrated by the fact that in this pioneering operation \\"not one drop of blood escaped at either of the lines of suture and distal pulses were instantly restored\\". The Pringle manoeuvre It is for the Pringle manoeuvre that his name remains known throughout the surgical world. The technique of occluding the portal triad to control haemorrhage in liver trauma which he described in the Annals of Surgery in 1908 is still widely used in modern hepatic surgery to minimise blood loss. Pringle's paper attests to the originality and logic of his thinking, often flying in the face of mainstream opinion. In describing his experience in dealing with liver injury he observed that portal triad occlusion controlled the bleeding from the liver sufficient to allow suturing or packing. \\"An assistant,\\" he wrote, \\"held the portal vein and the hepatic artery between a finger and thumb and completely arrested all bleeding.‚Äù Later life Pringle served in the First World War as a major in the RAMC at number 4 General Hospital at Stobhill, Glasgow. He retired from surgical practice in 1923 at the age of 60 and was elected Visitor (Vice- President) of the Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow in that year. He was a founder member of the Association of Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland and of the Moynihan Chirurgical Club. He died at his home in Killearn, Scotland, on 24 April 1941 at the age of 78Registrar General for Scotland. Statutory records of births, marriages and deaths.

Huelva province  History  Niebla's history dates back 3,000 years. The town's early importance was due to the silver industry, exploited by Phoenician traders by the 8th century B.C. The town was a commercial and political centre known as Ilipla in Roman times. By 713 the town of Ilipla was under Muslim control. The town became part of the emirate of Cordoba in 756 and further fortifications were constructed. From 1023 Niebla became the capital of the Taifa of Niebla, whose army fought the Taifa of Seville. The battle was lost and Niebla fell under the control of Seville in 1053. Islamic rule began to weaken after 1212, and the town was conquered in 1262 by Alfonso X of Castile.

He is best known as the creator and host of Loveline on KROQ-FM in Los Angeles from 1983 to 1993. He currently hosts a morning radio program on KOCI 101.5 FM, a station located in south Orange County, California.KOCI  Career in radio  Trenton began his entertainment career in the mid-80s on then underground alternative radio station KROQ-FM in Los Angeles. During the following decade, he created and hosted the popular nighttime show Loveline, co-hosted the KROQ morning show, and appeared on Oprah as one of the most outrageous DJs in America.  Early years  Under \\"The Poorman\\" moniker, Trenton wrote and self-published two guidebooks about dining in the Los Angeles area on a budget.These guidebooks are: * * In May 1981, Trenton broadcast his first of several reviews of inexpensive restaurants on KROQ. Trenton continued as the local surf reporter and went on to co-host the KROQ morning show with Richard Blade. From there, he became one of the station's most popular figures, when he created Loveline.  Loveline  Trenton created Loveline in 1983 as a Sunday night dating and relationships segment on Los Angeles radio station KROQ, hosted by Trenton, DJ Swedish Egil (Egil Aalvik), and Scott Mason. It began as a serious \\"public service\\" segment hosted by Mason, but Trenton revamped the format to a hybrid of advice and comedy. As Trenton found himself unable to answer serious medical questions related to sexual issues, he added a segment called \\"Ask a Surgeon,\\" and later \\"On Call with Dr. Drew,\\" hosted by his friend Drew Pinsky, who at the time, was a fourth-year medical student at the University of Southern California. This format became a fast hit for KROQ, catapulting Trenton and Drew to celebrity. On August 20, 1993, Trenton was a victim of a prank played by morning DJ Gene \\"Bean\\" Baxter, where Bean had an assistant walk into Trenton's unlocked house‚Äîwhile he was sleeping‚Äîto \\"celebrate\\" Trenton's 40th birthday. In response, Trenton organized approximately 500 listeners to gather on the front lawn of Bean's house at midnight, to have their own celebration. Bean complained to the station's management, which responded by terminating Trenton's employment. That month, he was replaced on Loveline by former MTV VJ Riki Rachtman. Loveline continued without Trenton, earning many millions of dollars, and becoming syndicated. It also had a televised run on MTV for a number of years. In 1994, Trenton sued KROQ, and demanded a piece of the revenues from Loveline. The court ruled against Trenton, citing that Loveline was created as part of Trenton's employment at KROQ, thereby making it their property. Trenton unsuccessfully appealed the decision.  Other radio work  From 1994 through 2004, Trenton worked at several Los Angeles-area radio stations. After departing KROQ, Trenton hosted shows on GrooveRadio (103.1), KIIS-FM (102.7), KPWR-FM (105.9), and twice at KYSR-FM (98.7). Later in 2001, Poorman joined the Rick Dees in the Morning Show on KIIS-FM Los Angeles as Rick's sidekick through 2004, until the Dees was replaced by Ryan Seacrest. Trenton became the only on-air talent in Los Angeles radio history to work at all three Los Angeles new music giants: KROQ, POWER 106, and KIIS. = KCAA and Poorman's Nation = In late 2010, Trenton began one of various stints on the pay-your-own-way broadcast station KCAA, based out of San Bernardino, California. While most hosts on the station pay hourly to host their own vanity programs, Poorman was given a free air slot, and had an agreement with station ownership to split the revenue from any advertising sold.Poorman Returns to KCAA The show \\"Poorman's Radio Invasion\\", ended after about a year, at which point he moved to New York to prepare for his new syndicated program. On October 10, 2011, Trenton began his syndicated show, called Poorman's Nation. Despite originally being promoted as a live call-in show, Poorman's Nation instead consisted solely of taped interviews from Occupy Wall Street. The program was syndicated by the Genesis Communications Network, but had just one affiliate, KCAA, which carried his original Radio Invasion program earlier in the year. Trenton conducted his on-the-street interviews while wearing only a Depression-era-style barrel, which earned him some degree of media attention, including an appearance on The Young Turks. However, the show failed to pick up any additional affiliates or local sponsors, and was canceled by the syndicator on November 7, 2011. Trenton returned to KCAA twice more between 2012 and 2015, with neither show lasting more than nine months.  Hosting  While working at KROQ in the mid-1980s, local Orange County TV station KDOC had a program called Adventures with the Poorman hosted by Trenton. In the late 1980s, Trenton hosted a show on KDOC called Request Video. This was a live show featuring videos of primarily rock and independent bands. In addition, Trenton took live phone calls and interviewed bands. His show was the first to interview the then-unknown Gwen Stefani and her band No Doubt. He quit after 15 months, complaining that the show did not pay him.  Poorman's Bikini Beach  In 1999, Trenton again returned to the television landscape, producing a program called Poorman's Bikini Beach. Like The Love Channel, Poorman owned and controlled the show, renting airtime from various television stations. It ran subsequent years, on various television stations including the Los Angeles station KJLA. Trenton canceled the program on January 17, 2011 to pursue other career opportunities in New York.

According to the 2005 census, the city has a population of 8,585 inhabitants.  Overview  At the tip of the \\"White towns route\\", the city of Olvera is in the province of Cadiz, in the northwest of the Serran√≠a Gaditana area, near the borders of the provinces of Seville and Malaga, on 36¬∫56' north and 5¬∫16' west, at a height of above sea level and has a land surface of . The distance between the capital and the Olvera is . The number of inhabitants, according to the INE of 2005, is 8,585, although the number of \\"Olvere√±os\\" is possibly greater as migration to the coast (specifically to the Costa de la Luz) in search of employment where individuals decided to change their address to their place of work. The hills surrounding Olvera are full of olive groves that are said to provide the best extraction of olive oils in Andalusia. In fact, the town is said to be surrounded by over 2 billion olive trees. In recent years it has received the award of the \\"Denominaci√≥n de Origen de la Sierra de C√°diz\\", which is a standard that is recognised by participants including nearby towns of Setenil, Algonodales, Alcal√° del Valle, Torre Al-Haquime etc. While olive groves are of great importance to the economy, the largest economic source of this colourful town is the \\"cooperative\\" and the prize \\"Arco Iris\\" of 1989 was won due to the town having the greatest number of cooperatives per inhabitant.There are certainly fewer than 1 billion olive trees in the whole of Spain which is the world's biggest producer. The figure of 2 billion around Olvera is wildly inaccurate. Of great interest within the municipality is a large colony of Andalusian griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus) to be found within the natural reserve of the \\"Pe√±on de Zaframag√≥n\\", a huge rock outcrop that is located 14 km to the northwest of the town centre. History Olvera from its castle There is a lack of specific data and studies into the true origin of the town. This means it is of conjecture to historians, some thinking that the present city was an establishment named Caricus, about the time of the Celts. Professor Ramos Santana posits that the legendary Cenosia, the original name of Olvera, located near the present city centre, was known as Vallehermoso (beautiful valley), existing at the time of the Visigoths. In this area of the mountain range of Sierra de Lijar are numerous Roman camps and remains. The archaeologist Lorenzo Perdigones' report (1986) shows the existence of a Roman establishment in the area, dated the end of 3rd century B.C. Indeed, the foundations of the city castle were found to be Roman, during the removal of some of the rubble. The original name of Olvera could be \\"Ilipa\\", (established by geographically adjusting in a map of Roman Spain, published in 1879, between Mor√≥n and Ronda). Hippa and Hippo Nova are likely names of the original village. But the first demonstrably reliable origin of Olvera is within Muslim documentation, in the mid 12th Century, when it is chronicled as an outpost in the mountains called \\"WUBIRA\\" or \\"URIWILA\\" (year 1327) when king Alfonso XI wrested it from the Arabs. As part of the Christian conquest plans emanting from Seville, Olvera formed part of the advance strategy towards the Straits of Gibraltar to prevent the reinsurgence of Muslims. In one first expedition the Christians lost the banner of Seville that flew in Olvera castle. After the negotiations that followed the surrender of the town, Ibrahim-ibn-Utmain secured concessions, in respect of the Moors of Olvera, that each one of the inhabitants could keep their houses and goods. The village was repopulated through a decree, a 'Letter of Population', issued on the 1 of August 1327, in which all criminals and debtors could, and had to, remain a year within the borders of Nazar√≠ (Granada province?) in order that their debt to society be removed. This new acquisition for the King of Castilla was named Olivera to commemorate the sea of olive trees that surround it. With time, the \\"i\\" was phonetically lost giving rise to the present name. In the middle of the 14th century the town passed to Don Alfonso Perez de Guzman. It is known that in 1395 Perez de Guzman arranged the marriage of his daughter with the son of the Muslim, Zunigaga. Olvera was host to a detachment of Napoleonic troops, who were constantly harassed by the activities of guerrillas from the town until the French retreated in 1812. Subsequently, two stately houses had the dominion over Olvera, the last of which was Tellez Giron and the Dukes of Osuna. The later was the feudal lord until 1843, when the family went bankrupt. Some of the advances and episodes of great importance in Spanish history during the 19th century were echoed in Olvera, for instance the revolution of September 1868, (known as 'The Glorious One'), when (after a brief period as a Republic) the Monarchy granted Olvera, by Royal Decree on 8 May 1877, the title of \\"City\\" by Alfonso XII, in gratitude for certain horses that sped him from the town of Olvera to one of the Carlist wars. The years of the dictatorship of Franco provided opportunities for the Olvere√±os, who benefited from the building of the Jerez-Almargen railroad which terminated within the municipality. The project was never finished. This is now a well known \\"Via Verde\\" - a nature walk of some 40 km. In 1983 Olvera was declared ‚ÄúA Protected Area of Artistic and Historical Importance‚Äù. At the present time, Olvera is dedicated to agriculture, forestry and animal husbandry, activities that are complemented by the tourist activities and the cooperatives.starting in Olvera and reaching Puerto Serrano. Nicholas de Ribera, El Viejo, 'the old one', was born in Olvera in 1487 and took part in the conquest of Peru. In 1535 he was named the first mayor of Lima. Economy Nowadays Olvera largely survives through family cooperatives, based on agriculture, tourism and the construction industry at the coast. Monuments of interest The main monument of this city is itself. A phrase that exemplifies this reality is \\"OLVERA is a street, a churchand a castle, BUT what a street, what a church and what a castle!\\", for that reason Olvera was declared ‚ÄúA Protected Area of Artistic and Historical Importance‚Äù in 1983. Nuestra Se√±ora de la Encarnaci√≥n church Parish of Our Lady of the Incarnation, Olvera Dominating the area, like the top of a pyramid, is Parroquia de Nuestra Se√±ora de la Encarnaci√≥n (the Parish of Our Lady of the Incarnation) next to the Arabic Castle: it is the vertex of a white expanse of houses amongst olive groves. This church, in neoclassic style, was built by the orders of the Duke of Osu√±a in 1822 (which created a debt with the Olvera township by not investing the taxes in the improvement of the town) on the foundations of a small gothic- mud√©jar (Andalucian Moorish) style church (conserving and incorporating a small baptismal room), which in turn was built on the foundations of an Arabic mosque. The work was finished in 1843, culminating in one of the greatest churches of the province, with dimensions worthy of cathedral. In 1936 republican revolutionaries burnt some of the icons and images along with the interior during the Spanish Civil War. In the interior are several frescos, stained glass windows of great value and images of the different phases of the death of Christ can be found, among them a Crucified Christ from the 16th century, discovered 15 years ago in the cellars of the building. The last restoration started in 1994 being closed to the congregation until the conclusion of works at the end of the 1999. At present the greater church of Olvera is again closed, due to a fire lasting 15 hours of an image/statue in September 2004, leaving the sacred place in lamentable condition. It is hoped that the necessary money will soon be obtained to reopen the church. The Arab castle As it stands, the castle was constructed at the end of the 12th century, mostly in the 13th, on a strategic rock, giving the ability to communicate with other nearby castles through signals (e.g. reflecting light with mirrors). Its structure was created deliberately to disadvantage enemy to the maximum. Castle of Olvera The Moorish Wall There exists seven buttresses that support the wall, demolition of some of the wall has emphasized the \\"Cilla\\", which served as a jail and a ducal barn, amongst other uses. Today it is a tourist office and a municipal museum, comprising four display rooms and a patio with a majestic view. In one of its rooms there is a permanent exhibition on \\"the Castles and Strengths of the Nazar√≠ Kingdoms\\". La Villa District Near these other buildings, in the ‚ÄúCasco Antig√ºo‚Äù (the ancient town center) within the old town walls is la villa (the village). To walk its streets is to travel 700 years back, to when an older Olvera existed. This was where the Visigoth town called Wubira existed. The towns origins are evident here, (narrow streets, strategic corners, old cottages, etc.), exposing the visitor to the old architecture of the Muslim town entwined with the modern. La plaza de Andalusia  The plaza, also called \\"La Alameda\\" (tree lined area), has a majestic stone fountain/waterfall constructed in 2004. Above this is el Pe√±√≥n del Sagrado Coraz√≥n de Jes√∫s (the Rock of the Sacred Heart of Jesus), a great rock garden full of ivy, flowers, birds and animals. The reason for its name is the Christ statue, with arms raised, on the highest part of the rock carved by Jose Even Navas, in 1929. El Santuario de Nuestra Se√±ora de Los Remedios The Sanctuary of Our Lady of the Remedies is 2 km from the town centre. It was constructed in the 18th century, in Andalucian style on the foundations of a small hermitage. It venerates the patron of the locality, Nuestra Se√±ora de Los Remedios, who is loved by the town of Olvera and many towns around, known collectively as ‚Äúlas cientos sierras‚Äù (the 100 mountain ranges). Unknown persons created an original statue to her during the 16th century, which was restored 10 years ago. The head of the statue is in poor condition as the galleries became infested with termites for more than a century, however, the best possible restoration has been applied to it. The Archbishop of Seville, Don Good Jose Maria Monreal, was crowned here in 1966. El Monasterio de Ca√±o Santos Located 7 km from Olvera, it was constructed in 1542. For many years it was the seat of the old patrona of the city, the Holy virgin of Ca√±o, an image kept by the local Franciscan friars who inhabited the interior. In 1835 they were expelled and the monastery confiscated and abandoned. After many years, when the building was all but lost, the council of Andalusia decided to restore it. Although the monument is within the municipality of Olvera, this monastery is property of the city council of Alcala del Valle.

According to estimates made by the National Statistics Institute of Spain (INE), the municipality has a population of 9,773 inhabitants in 2018. It is surrounded by the Los Alcornocales Natural Park. The municipality contains three major towns, Jimena de la Frontera, Estaci√≥n and San Pablo de Buceite. History The town has been inhabited by the Phoenicians, Iberians, Carthaginians, and the Romans. The Moors used the town's position on the hill to their advantage, using it as a strategic military position. The village of Jimena de la Frontera became a town in 1879, during the reign of Alfonso XII. In its past it was most likely a very important trading hub as the Roman coins found near the castle have script in both Latin and Phoenician. Today Today, Jimena's population of around 10,000 has been made up of an increasing number of British ex-pats. The town is served by road and rail. The main road stretches north to Ronda, and south to San Roque. The railway station is situated just outside the town in nearby Estaci√≥n de Jimena. Several trains a day stop at Jimena on the line between Algeciras and Granada. Castle The castle was built on the hill by the Moors around 750 A.D. as part of making Jimena a strategic military position, today it is known as Castle of Jimena de la Frontera. Views stretch as far Gibraltar to the south. It is believed that the castle was built on Roman ruins, constructed using locally sourced limestone.
