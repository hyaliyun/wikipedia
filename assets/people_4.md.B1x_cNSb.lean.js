Main cast  * Joanne Gale as Kate Meadows * Simon Burbage as Duke Wilcott * David Anderson as Paul * Adrian Annis as Alan * Vanessa Mayfield as Louise Whelan * Lydia Kay as Security Guard * Rich Keeble as Dr. Williams  Production  The film was made on a budget of ¬£10,000 and was crowdfunded. Initial filming began in 2012, with additional pick ups in 2014. In between filming blocks, Spinks shot the feature film Extinction.  Release and reception  Survivors was released in the UK on 26 October 2015 on DVD and on VOD, having being made available in the US, Canada and Mexico a week earlier on 20 October. Critical reaction to the film was generally positive. James Simpson of Infernal Cinema described the film as \\"a superb British horror\\". Elliott Maguire of UK Horror Scene praised the actors, particularly Burbage, as well as the visual effects and sound design, but was critical about the pacing of the film. Trilbee commented on a number of production deficiencies but was again complimentary about the acting quality, in particular that of Gale, concluding that the film \\"does something rather unique in the low-budget scene in that it brings the subgenre back to what made it so relevant and popular in the first place; that it‚Äôs not about the zombies or the make-up, it‚Äôs about the people.\\" The film won \\"best director\\" at the Mac Horror Film Festival 2015.

Three Case Studies from the Sixteenth Century\\". Text and Event in Early Modern Europe. died post-1584) was an Italian apothecary, writer, natural philosopher and women's advocate during the early modern period. This \\"self-described pharmacist\\" published a book, in the form of letter-essays, about her views on topics of science and natural philosophy. Erculiani's Lettre di philosophia naturale or Letters on Natural Philosophy was published in 1584. Due to some of the unconventional theories presented in her work, she was put on trial by the Roman Inquisition on charges of suspected heresy- for the \\"blurring of boundaries between natural philosophy and theology.\\" Although the trial records are lost, it is speculated that Erculiani was likely pardoned. Life Many of the specifics of Camilla Erculiani's personal life are unknown. This female apothecary resided in Padua, Italy, a province of Veneto; a community that was particularly active in medical and scientific pursuits in the early modern era. In fact, Galileo taught at the University of Padua during this time. Moreover, Padua, Italy, was one of the first locations that could boast a botanical garden in 1545. Camilla, daughter to spice merchant Andrea Greghetti, was herself one of six children. She was twice married and mother of six children. Her first husband, Aloviso Stella, was the owner of an apothecary's shop called the Tre Stelle, which was located in the town of Sant'Andrea in Padua. Camilla remarried after his death. Her second husband, Giacomo Erculiani, was also an apothecary. He inherited the role of proprietor at the Tre Stelle. Erculiani had one child with her first husband and five with the other, whom she married half a year later. The details and date of her death remain a mystery, yet it is likely that she died post-1584.  Professional life  204x204px = Apothecary = Erculiani referred to herself as a \\"speziala,\\" which translates to \\"female spicer.\\" Generally, this reflects that she was a spicer-apothecary, \\"indicating those who made and sold botanical and pharmaceutical remedies (which often included spices).\\" Early modern spicer-apothecaries were an outlet to buyers for both botanical and pharmaceutical remedies, selling candies, cosmetics, paper, and medicines. Other examples of goods one could purchase at an apothecary shop include herbs, fruits, precious oils, resins and perfume musk. Typical diseases that the general population sought remedies for were \\"dropsy, pox, worms, rickets, scurvy, numerous skin problems and gout...\\" Despite her use of this title in the intro to her published work, Erculiani was not an officially listed member of the apothecaries guild. Erculiani worked alongside both of her husbands as a practicing female apothecary. In the early modern period, it was customary for the wives of merchants to learn their husbands' trade, as they played an integral role in the running of family businesses. She herself claimed that her knowledge did not come from any university, but was a result of innate understanding and experience. Erculiani was very educated, despite her claims otherwise‚Äîin her works, she often cites Galen and Aristotle. The early modern pharmacy was a popular location to spread new ideas, including religious dissent, and it was frequently on watch lists during the Inquisition. This indicates the atmosphere of freedom Erculiani likely experienced in her life as an apothecary and the access she had to new ideas. Being an apothecary was associated with practicing within a particular division of medicine. Since the majority of women in this era were denied access to university training, apprenticeship was one way to acquire the skills needed to practice. In addition, like Erculiani, widows had the option to keep their shops running as long as another man assumed proprietorship. She used the methods of a typical apothecary of the 16th century. Medieval apothecaries were the original \\"general practitioner.\\" They were heavily involved in both dispensing medications and providing medical advice. These methods reflect practices passed on to the field of Pharmacy as the Modern Period. = \\"Principia Philosophia\\" = In her work \\"Principia Philosophia,\\" Erculiani addresses several topics, all the while repeatedly hitting on the intelligence and true equality of ability possessed by women. No effort is ever made to hide the gender of the person whose work this is‚Äîit is in fact noted very early on in the text. Although she claimed early in the text to be unlearned and to focus on \\"innate\\" reasoning, she exhibits her understanding of important writers such as Galen and Aristotle and suggest well-crafted reasons to deviate from their long accepted teachings. She is also inconsistent in her work because she continually supports a separation between theology and natural philosophy, while she frequently comes close to connecting the two. The format on this work as a series of letters perhaps had the effect of cushioning the reality of the (anti-religious) statements she was making. The introduction to her first work contains disclaimers noting that she only published by force‚Äîsomeone else threatened to publish her work under another name. Also in this same section, she focuses back on her roles as a wife and mother. This could arguably be a method to deflect criticism. She seems to have taken these as important parts of her life, but she no less thought women deserved a place in the realm of science. In addition to the general content discussing the natural sciences, her work contains four letters. Two by her to Giorgio Garnero, one of Garnero's response, and a final letter addressed to Martin Berzeviczy. The use of letter writing was a popular literary technique of the age. Sometimes full published letters would be fabricated just for publishing, or real letters would be published without the permission of the sender. This method additionally permitted authors to state the views of the other side without claiming support for them, as well as create a clear avenue to respond to each point of possible criticism. Reflecting on the past is also a way to avoid criticism and the consequences of such things stated in the past. In Garnero's response, he refers to Erculiani's arguments as \\"gifts from the Holy Spirit\\" which further protects her from trouble due to her actual views. His letter continues to praise her as a positive influence in science due to her devotion that comes with little in return (no wealth, fame, or money). He is thus able to support her credibility, all the while providing counterpoints to her arguments. One of the final big pieces of her work focused on the cause of the great Biblical flood. This was a hot topic of the century, as many were concerned that other factors would result in another one. Erculiani attempt to explain the cause of mortality beyond the Original Sin and linked it to the flood. She combines her understanding of the humors with those of the elements found in nature of earth, water, and air. In explaining a cycle where by the death of man replenishes the element earth back to the planet, she postulated that a detriment existed in the supply of earth available to the Earth at the time of the flood. This factor allowed the water element to \\"take over\\" and engulf the land. This explanation was contrary to that put forth by several natural philosophers of the time, who explained that only divine intervention could cause another such flood due to the \\"natural stasis of elements.\\" The focus on finding natural, scientific reasoning for Biblical events was very important during this period. Erculiani's understanding of elements through her pharmaceutical work shines through this explanation in particular, and also shows her understanding of the four major pillars of Paracelus's theory of medicine. Later in the text, she again diverges from the largely accepted views of, this time, Aristotle with regards to rainbows. The letter to Berzevczy was framed in response to an accusation he made concerning her writings on the Biblical Flood. He considered her work not to be her own, but rather taken from the writings of others. Her response was formatted so as to demolish such a criticism in her genuine belief in the importance of free and frequent critical thought. Here, as opposed to the beginning of her Letters, she does discuss the importance of reading the works of other authors. Her work played a great role in challenging both old scientific concepts as well as the place of women in science. There is some evidence to suggest Erculiani wrote more than her most famous work, but they have yet to be rediscovered since it refers to other works currently unknown. Influence Camilla Erculiani's work Letters on Natural Philosophy(1584) was published and circulated in Krakow, Poland and dedicated to, Anna Jagiellon Bathory (1523‚Äì96), queen of Poland. With her strong familial and intellectual connections to Italy, Queen Anna had a reputation as an advocate for women's educational pursuits within the scientific disciplines. Although there was an upsurge of female authors engaged in scientific debate during the late sixteenth-century, Erculiani's letter-treatise is likely \\"the earliest sustained published exercise in natural-philosophical writing by an Italian woman.\\" Within this scientific discourse, formed into a collection of four letters, she explored alternate theories in the realm of natural philosophy. Erculiani questioned established scientific and theological doctrine with various debates regarding meteorology, the position of Venus, astrology, the scientific cause of the Biblical flood, Paracelsian medicine, alchemy, and the formation of rainbows. The first two letters of Ecruliani's treatise were addressed to Giorgio Garnero (1550-1614), \\"a Burgundian medical writer\\", while the third letter consisted of his responses to her philosophical viewpoints. In an excerpt from Erculiani's letter to Garnero, she speculated that the Biblical flood occurred because of an imbalance between earth and man: > \\"[the deluge] occurred because men's presence on earth had increased so much > in number, size, and lifespan, that around the time of the sin, the earth > element, which dominates men, was much diminished; nor had it been > replenished for centuries, with the result that [the earth] was so greatly > diminished that it was necessarily swallowed up by water, which had > contributed little of itself to [the composition of] men.\\" Erculiani later followed up the statement within her fourth letter, addressed to Queen Anna's \\"chancellor for Transylvania\\", Martin Berzevicy (1538-1596), who visited Padua in 1568. She expressed her belief that God and nature work in unison: \\"it is true that the doctors of the church and the divine theologians have put forth different causes and reasons; but for me, it is enough to say that God and Nature herself do not contradict those causes, but He makes use of her in His works.\\" Erculiani also took advantage of her literary platform to advocate for the recognition of women as adept contributors to the scientific community. She was provoked by the querrelle des femmes (debate on women): a literary and philosophical debate about the intellectual capacities of women, which focused heavily on the women of her region. In reaction, Erculiani introduced her book with two prefatory letters of dedication in defense of women. Within the first, to Queen Anna of Poland, she wrote, \\"I don't know what malignant star causes [men] to refuse to recognize greatness, except in the things they accomplish themselves.\\" Within the second, to her readers, Erculiani stated, \\"It will undoubtedly amaze some that I, a woman, have set myself to write and publish on a subject that does not belong to women (according to the custom of our age); but...you will find that women are not without the same abilities and virtues as men.\\" Despite her continual focus on the equality of men and women in intellect, the very differences between the two sexes as seen by society are perhaps what saved her from the Inquisition.

A supporter of radical politics turned loyalist, he is known for his 1800 pamphlet expos√© The Rise and Dissolution of the Infidel Societies in this Metropolis. His later views turned again towards radicalism.Mark Philp, Vulgar Conservatism, 1792‚Äì3, The English Historical Review Vol. 110, No. 435 (Feb., 1995), pp. 42‚Äì69, at p. 68. Published by: Oxford University Press. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/573375 Early life The son of servants in the household of the Duke of Hamilton, Reid was a Londoner, initially apprenticed to a maker of silver buckles. Completing this Soho apprenticeship in 1779, he worked as a journeyman in his trade, in Smithfield, London. In 1811 he wrote that when young he heard the preachers Martin Madan and William Romaine. Reid began on a literary career in the 1780s. He was introduced to the Esto Perpetua Whig political writers' club, founded in 1785, \\"almost certainly,\\" according to Iain McCalman, by George Ellis. 1790s A contributor to the Visits from the World of Spirits (1791) of Henry Lemoine, Reid has been described as a \\"typical Jacobin litterateur\\" of the 1790s.Angela Esterhammer, \\"Historicizing Blake\\" at Strawberry Hill, The Wordsworth Circle Vol. 22, No. 2 (Spring 1991), pp. 135‚Äì136, at p. 136. Published by: Marilyn Gaull Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/24044590 In 1792 he mentioned work he had as a translator, from Dutch. This employment was removed, by a monopoly given to the Post Office. As an early member of the radical London Corresponding Society (LCS), Reid in 1793 wrote Hum! Hum!, a satirical song against those who professed \\"loyalism\\" (i.e. anti-radicalism) as a way to personal advancement. He was apprehended in early 1798 during a raid on a meeting in the St Martin's Lane area of London, which took in 57 of those attending but not John Binns, a prominent figure of the United Irishmen, and the raid's intended target. (Binns was arrested not much later, according to Reid, with Arthur O'Connor in Kent.) McCalman states that Reid then acted as a government informer, monitoring a subversive meeting in Cripplegate, as a matter of self- preservation. The circulation of his intelligence was to George Canning, Richard Ford, and John King. Reid also sought patronage, by conforming to loyalist attitudes of the period, putting himself forward as a man of letters. He subsequently wrote a pamphlet from a loyalist point of view, the Rise and Dissolution of the Infidel Societies of 1800 (see below), for which he is best known.Iain McCalman, Ultra-Radicalism and Convivial Debating-Clubs in London, 1795‚Äì1838, The English Historical Review Vol. 102, No. 403 (Apr., 1987), pp. 309‚Äì333, at pp. 309‚Äì10. Published by: Oxford University Press. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/572273 Around this time he also expressed similar opinions in letters to the Anti-Jacobin Review. He was given cash by Canning, and the approval, according to his widow, of the bishops Shute Barrington and Beilby Porteus, with Porteus offering him Anglican ordination. Later life Reid later edited the Orthodox Churchman's Magazine, which was subsequently taken over by John Watkins.M. J. D. Roberts, The Society for the Suppression of Vice and Its Early Critics, 1802‚Äì1812, The Historical Journal Vol. 26, No. 1 (Mar., 1983), pp. 159‚Äì176, at p. 167. Published by: Cambridge University Press Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/2638853 The Magazine was hostile to deists, Latitudinarians, Methodists and Unitarians, and its tone was set from the first issue in 1801 by the High Church views of William Stevens. In 1806, however, Reid dropped his Anglican affiliations, joining the Unitarian congregation of Thomas Belsham in Hackney. He contributed unpaid material to the Monthly Repository. In the September 1806 issue of the Repository, an article signed \\"W. H. R.\\" commented favourably on the abolition of the Holy Roman Empire, and the prospects for universal toleration. Reid went on to abandon the Unitarianism he found too formal. He twice called on the Royal Literary Fund for support, initially in 1810. He died on 3 June 1826. The Rise and Dissolution of the Infidel Societies in this Metropolis (1800) Reid's work on London debating societies followed a magistrate's raid in 1798. He gave specifics of seven London societies, five of those meeting in the City of London area. There are few other sources for these clubs.Mary Thale, London Debating Societies in the 1790s, The Historical Journal Vol. 32, No. 1 (Mar., 1989), pp. 57‚Äì86, at p. 82.

A contemporary view saw The Rise and Dissolution as following also the thought of John Robison. The work played on fears that the debating societies were breeding grounds for subversion and plotting, and that the \\"clubbists\\" who frequented them were potential revolutionaries. Reid referenced the pre-1789 Robin Hood Society. He also claimed that a typical benefit society meeting might be the occasion for circulation of The Age of Reason.Susan Budd, The Loss of Faith. Reasons for Unbelief among Members of the Secular Movement in England, 1850‚Äì1950, Past & Present No. 36 (Apr., 1967), pp. 106‚Äì125, at p. 110 note 11. Published by: Oxford University Press on behalf of The Past and Present Society. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/649918 Adopting Edmund Burke's doctrine of the negative effects of association, Reid attributed the irreligion and subversion expressed in debating clubs to the thought of William Godwin, Tom Paine, Joseph Priestley, Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Voltaire. It was reviewed in the New Annual Register as a \\"miscellaneous production\\", while The Critical Review noted that Reid's work in its 117 pages included in its net also Methodist preachers and Swedenborgians, the Whig Club and the LCS. One consequence of Reid's work as an informer, at the Green Dragon in Cripplegate, was that he was able to link Bannister Truelock, a millenarian Methodist preacher in the LCS, to James Hadfield, who attempted in 1800 to assassinate the King. Reid's attack on Godwin has been called \\"dull and vicious\\", and compared to that of the loyalist John Bowles. Against Paine's influence, Reid recommended Richard Watson's Apology for the Bible. The anti-Methodist polemicist Thomas Ellis Owen cited Reid in his 1801 tract Hints to Heads of Families. =Reid on the London Corresponding Society= Reid gave an account of the expulsions of the booksellers John Bone (a United Englishman) and Richard Lee (\\"Citizen Lee\\", a Methodist) from the LCS, on the grounds of their refusal to sell The Age of Reason and the Ruins of Empire of the Comte de Volney.Jon Mee, Anxieties of Enthusiasm: Coleridge, Prophecy, and Popular Politics in the 1790s, Huntington Library Quarterly, Vol. 60, No. 1/2, Enthusiasm and Enlightenment in Europe, 1650‚Äì1850 (1997), pp. 179‚Äì203, at p. 187. Published by: University of Pennsylvania Press DOI: 10.2307/3817836 Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/3817836 E. P. Thompson considered accurate at least Reid's description of this phase of the LCS, during which Francis Place was planning the publication of a cheap edition of The Age of Reason. This initiative was divisive, and its effect on the LCS was to bring to the surface religious differences. In 1795, Methodists in the LCS had tried, and failed, to purge deists and atheists. Robert Watson (c.1746‚Äì1838), a close associate of Lord George Gordon, had been excluded from membership, together with hatter Richard Hodgson for supporting the views of Paine. According to Thale, Reid himself broke from the LCS when deism was becoming compulsory for its members. Bone became a founder of the London Reformation Society. Charles Sturt (1763‚Äì1812), a Member of Parliament and honorary LCS member, gave a compatible account of Lee's two expulsions from the LCS in a speech in the Commons. =Infidels and enthusiasts= Rise and Dissolution purported to trace the connections, dating from the 17th century, between religious enthusiasm and secular reform organisations. Reid associated Priestley's rational dissent with the opinions of David Williams, supporter of the Octagon Chapel liturgy and \\"unconditional philosophical liberty\\". He tended to blur distinctions between reformers, unbelievers, deists and millenarians, all of whom were accorded a hearing in the Unitarian tradition of unbounded debate. He characterized the \\"Society of Ancient Deists\\", who met near Hoxton in the period 1770 to 1790, as \\"infidel mystics\\". Reid also described as dangerous the staid deist and political debating clubs run by Williams. In the context of the Corresponding Societies Act of 1799, he noted that Middlesex magistrates had been cracking down on meetings of followers of Priestley, as deist-radical, and as so many attempts by the \\"infidel illuminati\\" to establish a \\"place of public instruction\\".Paul Weindling, Science and Sedition: How Effective Were the Acts Licensing Lectures and Meetings, 1795‚Äì1819?, The British Journal for the History of Science Vol. 13, No. 2 (Jul., 1980), pp. 139‚Äì153, at pp. 147‚Äì8.

He warned also against the numerous \\"fanatical preachers\\" of low backgrounds, such as Richard Brothers.Alfred Rubens, Portrait of Anglo- Jewry 1656‚Üê1836, Transactions (Jewish Historical Society of England) Vol. 19 (1955‚Äì59), pp. 13‚Äì52, at p. 34. Published by: Jewish Historical Society of England. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/29777944 Commentary in John Brewster's Secular Essay of 1802 clarifies that street preachers to whom Reid objected, of Spa Fields and Islington, included Calvinistic Methodists, many of them young men, associated with Lady Anne Agnes Erskine's connexion. =Antinomian theology= Reid isolated the concept of self-sufficiency, at the spiritual level, as the factor connecting religious enthusiasts and rationalist infidels. In this way he linked Samuel How, an antinomian writer in 1640, with Paine. How's work, The Sufficiency of the Spirit, had been in print since 1792. He linked also Swedenborg's theology with Muggletonian belief in the antinomian conception of Christ retaining human form in heaven. Peter Linebaugh and Marcus Rediker compare Rise and Dissolution to the heresiological work Gangraena of 1646. Poetry Reid is cited as one of the co-authors of Criticisms on the Rolliad (1784). Sherbo identifies Reid's first published verse as from 1787, in the Gentleman's Magazine. On his own account, Reid belonged in the group of poets including Thomas Chatterton, Robert Burns, Charlotte Smith and Ann Yearsley. Another such \\"untutored\\" poet was Ann Batten Cristall. Such writers were typically promoted by supportive reviewers. Reid had the backing of John Nichols of the Gentleman's Magazine.

It draws on arguments found in Isaac La Peyr√®re, Thomas Beverley (died 1702) and Francis Lee; but also in Priestley's Letters to the Jews (1794). Reid adopted philosemitic views as a follower of Napoleon's attitude. He went on to write controversially against Samuel Horsley, invoking older ideas of Gilbert Burnet, Pierre Jurieu and Joseph Mede, and the Jewish writers Isaac Abravanel and David Levi. He and others holding related opinions, such as the Baptist James Bicheno, were attacked by the Jewish Conversion Society.

The legend says Rapa Nui (Easter Island) had once been a territory similar in size to a continent which reached next to another large land mass, Puku-Puhipuhi. Uoke with his lever rose and sank Rapa Nui while Puku-Puhipuhi sagged and rose. The deity had fun in this task, when, at the time that Rapa Nui was almost completely buried and Puku-Puhipuhi was at its maximum elevation, his lever suddenly broke.

Shortly after completing the work Williams wrote to Gerald Cockshott, in 1945, saying \\"I don't want to stay in London ‚Äì I just long to get home and live in comfort by the sea\\". She returned to her home town of Barry in south Wales, two years later. The suite was premiered by the BBC Welsh Orchestra conducted by Mansel Thomas in 1947. Since then Sea Sketches has become one of her most popular works, second only to her Fantasia on Welsh Nursery Tunes. and has been performed twice at the BBC Proms. Music The suite is composed for string orchestra and comprises five movements depicting various moods of the sea. The movements are: #High Wind (Allegro energetico) #Sailing Song (Allegretto) #Channel Sirens (Lento misterioso) #Breakers (Presto) #Calm Sea in Summer (Andante tranquillo) Publication Sea Sketches was published in 1951 by the Oxford University Press (OUP).

The band is primarily composed of Ascaris and Matron Thorn, though additional musicians take on drum and guitar duties for live performances. The band was formed in 2010 by Ascaris and Matron Thorn and they have released four full-length albums and five EPs to date.  History  The band was formed in 2010 when, after touring together in different bands, Matron Thorn approached Ascaris about forming a project together. Thorn described that \\"There was a certain chemistry onstage that suggested something more to our encounter, creatively.\\" They deliberately sought to create a sound that was very distinct from the projects they had previously worked on, and \\"at the heart of √Üvangelist, we have always sought to provide an honest reflection of human existence through our mirrors to the other side. Terror and misery were simply the result of our formula.\\" They released their first EP 'Oracle of Infinite Despair' independently in 2011, and Thorn claims the album was distributed \\"only among close friends, as well as a small network of our friends and colleagues.\\" Luciano Gaglio of I, Void Hanger Records became aware of the EP and approached the band about working together, and the band released their first full-length album 'De Masticatione Mortuorum in Tumulis' on his record label on October 16, 2012, which also featured the three songs from their first EP. The album was received well, with Kim Kelly naming it the 15th best metal album of 2012 in her column for MetalSucks. She described the album as \\"an unnerving cluster of warped black, death, doom, psychotic wails, dead choirs, creepy samples, and generally fucked-up sounds that is genuinely frightening at times.\\" The band released their second full-length album 'Omen Ex Simulcra' on November 29, 2013, this time through Debemur Morti Productions. The album garnered critical acclaim, receiving positive reviews by Pitchfork, Metal Injection, Invisible Oranges, CVLT Nation, and others. In her review for Pitchfork, Kelly wrote that √Üvangelist \\"create an aural monster, a horrific re-imagining of black/death metal coupled with harsh electronic noise and industrial mechanization.\\" On January 25, 2014 the band performed at the Saint Vitus bar in Brooklyn, New York along with Oak, Artificial Brain, and Disparish. Reviewing the show for Invisible Oranges, Doug Moore described the band's performance: \\"Every member wears tribal-ish makeup; vocalist Ascaris sports a mask and is prone to rolling around on the floor; instrumental main man Matron Thorn plays a hollow-bodied jazz guitar instead of the standard pointy-framed Jackson or BC Rich. Most importantly, the band doesn't have a live drummer. They rely on a drum machine instead ‚Äî always a dicey proposition for a death metal band.\\" They released their third full-length album 'Writhes in the Murk' on September 12, 2014, again to critical acclaim. Noisey premiered the track 'The Only Grave' in advance of the album's release, adding \\"Taking pages from bands like Incantation, Portal and others, √Üvangelist use death metal as their primary vehicle to launch their nightmare, but dip into dark ambient, black metal and power electronics to seal in even more horror.\\" No Clean Singing also premiered the track 'Pr√¶ternigma' in advance of the album's release, describing the music as \\"dense and enveloping, with writhing, grinding riffs generating a moving mass of ominous sound.\\" The album was received positively by Metal Injection, Echoes and Dust, Invisible Oranges, CVLT Nation, and others. Steel for Brains highlighted the album, writing that \\"Thankfully √Üvangelist make more than good on the promise indicated by the album's title. This music is parasitic in every good way, burrowing into every dark corner of each composition until the light has nowhere to escape.\\" They released the experimental EP/album 'Dream an Evil Dream' on September 16, 2015, consisting of a single 38-minute, largely improvised song. They followed this with the release of their fourth full-length studio album 'Enthrall to the Void of Bliss' on October 9 that same year, this time through the record label 20 Buck Spin. Prior to the album's release, No Clean Singing premiered the song 'Levitating Stones', writing that \\"Based on this first offering, I'm also guessing that the album will be one of 2015's true highlights.\\" The album received very positive reviews by About.com, CVLT Nation, Consequence of Sound, Echoes and Dust, and others. MetalSucks wrote that \\"Fans of dark and messy death metal will fall (mostly) in love with Enthrall to the Void of Bliss.\\" In October 2015 the band performed at the California Deathfest festival that took place in Oakland, California. Reviewing the festival for No Clean Singing, Islander wrote that \\"At some point afterward, I told a new acquaintance that, for me, the mark of the finest performances at a live show is when the music is so all-consuming that I forget where I am, that I get so lost in what I'm seeing and hearing that every other thought is blown out of my head. I saw lots of fine bands at this festival, but there weren't many who had that effect on me. √Üvangelist were one.\\" In April 2016 it was confirmed that the band would release a split EP with the French avant-garde black metal band Blut Aus Nord. The EP, titled 'Codex Obscura Nomina', is due for release on June 17, 2016 through Debemur Morti Productions.  Musical style and influences  The band primarily play a mixture of black metal and death metal but with many experimental and avant-garde elements. Many critics have noted the emphasis the band place on creating a terrifying, nightmarish atmosphere, as well as the use of unconventional instruments such as saxophones, violins, and cellos. In her review of 'Omen Ex Simulcra' music critic Kim Kelly wrote that \\" the listener is confronted by claustrophobia, fear, and naked aggression.\\" Speaking to New Noise Magazine, Matron Thorn explained that \\"The music and lyrics combine to transmit the dark frequency of the esoteric, which is heard by every person who decides to listen. Nothing is necessary to channel the muse that endows the art, for it is something which defies rational explanation, yet we carry with us always.\\" The band also attempt to subvert the listener's expectations of what the band's image ought to be, both in terms of broader gender norms as well as what corpse paint should look like, as well as what instruments are and are not acceptable. When asked about why the band play with the issue of gender roles and norms in their live shows, vocalist Ascaris said the following:  Band members  = Current =  √Üvangelist  * Ascaris ‚Äì vocals, saxophone, cello * Matron Thorn ‚Äì guitars, bass, drums, vocals, noise  Live musicians  * √Üryn ‚Äì guitars (2014‚Äìpresent) * S√¶lith ‚Äì drums (2014‚Äìpresent) * R√¶nym - bass (2016‚Äìpresent) = Former =  Live musicians  * ][ ‚Äì bass, vocals (2013‚Äì2015) * Auditor ‚Äì effects, ambience, atmosphere, noise (2014‚Äì2015) * C.

Early life and family  He was born May 15, 1840, son of Francis White Cloud and Mary Many Days Robidoux. His Ioway name was The-gro-wo-nung. On the paternal side, he was grandson of Mahaska, for whom White Cloud, Kansas, is named. On the maternal side, he was grandson of Joseph Robidoux IV, founder of St. Joseph, Missouri and his second wife, whose name is unknown.http://www.genealogy.com/forum/surnames/topics/robidoux/53/ His parents founded one of the main families of M√©tis people who played a major role in the 19th century fur trade in Missouri and Kansas. Another prominent M√©tis family, that of Joseph Dorian, was likely related to two of James' wives. His father was killed in 1859 in a skirmish with the Pawnee. White Cloud attended mission school at Highland, Kansas, and served as a Scout for Company C, 14th Regiment Kansas Volunteer Cavalry of the Union Army in the American Civil War. He saw action when the Union repelled William Quantrill's raid at Lawrence, known as the Lawrence massacre.  As chief  He served as Chief of the Ioway Indian Nation from 1865 until his death in 1940. On February 28, 1867, James married a full-blooded Ioway named Pumpkin Vine (Wy- to-hum-gra-mee), later known as Grandma Louise White Cloud. She lived from 1848 to 1914 and was the daughter of Sho-tom-he and his wife Daw-ya-ma-mee. Of their two sons, only Lewis White Cloud grew to maturity. Ioway custom allowed as many wives as a man could afford and, in 1874, while still married to Pumpkin Vine, James married Lydia Dorian, an Ioway woman. James and his two wives lived in the same house. James and Lydia divorced in 1875. James' third marriage was in 1875 to Sallie Dorian of the Sac and Fox Nation. They had two children, Emma Little Crow and Joseph White Cloud, and they divorced in 1883. His fourth wife was Josie Dorian, an Ioway. They married in 1884 and divorced in 1885. James received 160 acres of land in northeast Brown County on the Ioway Reservation, 100 acres of which was in cultivation. The farm had a three-room house, with outbuildings, a well, and a bark mill, the only one on the reservation. James and his granddaughter Louise White Cloud both died in 1940 and were buried in Tesson Cemetery in Brown County. The Tesson Cemetery was named for Joseph Tesson, of the Sac and Fox Nation, who was the brother-in law of James White Cloud, having married two of his sisters. After his death in 1940, his great-grandson, Jimmy Rhodd (1935‚Äì1997; alt. James Mahaska Rhodd), became chief of the Iowa Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska.

He gained his MA in 1984 with a study of the Kun Iam Tong temple in Macau. He completed his PhD in 1993 with a dissertation on early Portuguese voyages of discovery. It was entitled Purjeet kohti Guineaa! Analyysi Portugalin l√∂yt√∂retkien kulttuurisesta aspektista ('Sails towards Guinea! An analysis of the cultural aspects of Portuguese voyages of discovery'). In it he studies the earliest phases of European colonialism. He based his study on Portuguese chronicles and archival materials. His study is said to have been an ambitious one. Later Ruohonen specialized in the early stages of colonialism in Portugal and Latin America, as well as on the anthropological study on Venezuela. In addition to his career in science, Ruohonen was also a film maker, having made more than 20 of them.

She has been described as alt-right and a white nationalist. In 2015, Southern ran as a Libertarian Party candidate in the Canadian federal election. She worked for The Rebel Media until March 2017, doing independent work before subsequently announcing her retirement from political activism on 2 June 2019. Southern announced her return to YouTube on 19 June 2020. Southern is known for her promotion of the Great Replacement conspiracy theory. A YouTube video of the same name she released in July 2017 has more than 680,000 views and is credited with helping to popularize the white supremacist conspiracy theory. In 2017, Southern supported the white Identitarian group Defend Europe opposing the action of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) involved in search-and-rescue operations in the Mediterranean Sea. She was detained by the Italian Coast Guard for blocking a ship embarking on a search-and-rescue mission. In March 2018, she was questioned under the UK Terrorism Act and barred from entering Britain because of her intentions during her March visit. In July 2018, she went on a speaking tour of Australia with Stefan Molyneux. In August 2018, her attempted speaking tour of New Zealand was unsuccessful. The Auckland Council cancelled Southern's booking of a council venue and blocked her from using its venues, saying she wished to \\"stir up ethnic or religious tensions\\". Education and personal life Southern was born in Surrey, British Columbia. She studied political science at the University of the Fraser Valley and completed two years without graduating. Southern said she dropped out because \\"it was a waste of money to pay for knowledge she could obtain on her own.\\" In a documentary about the alt-right produced by The Atlantic, \\"Southern admits late in the film that her [then] boyfriend, with whom she's having a baby, is not white.\\" On 29 January 2020, Southern posted on Instagram announcing that, since her leaving public life, she had married and given birth to a son, while also announcing a desire to keep her family life private.üñâ As of 2020, she lives in Sydney, Australia with her Australian husband. Political career In 2015, Southern was a candidate in the 2015 Canadian federal election representing the Libertarian Party in the district of Langley‚ÄîAldergrove. She was briefly removed by the party as a candidate, but was eventually reinstated with support from Breitbart News and The Rebel Media. The election was won by Conservative candidate Mark Warawa. Southern finished last, having received 535 votes, or 0.9% of the total. Activism In June 2015, while reporting on the Vancouver SlutWalk for The Rebel Media, Southern's cameraman was shoved and Southern's protest sign stating \\"There Is No Rape Culture in the West\\" was torn up.Jean-Fran√ßois Cloutier: Lauren Southern troll la SlutWalk , TVQC, 14 June 2015. In March 2016, a protester in Vancouver poured an unknown liquid over Southern's head while she was engaging with LGBTQ protesters at a rally in Vancouver, arguing for two human genders. Southern was mistakenly suspended from Facebook, having criticized the site for banning several conservative commentators. She later received an email apology from Facebook saying the suspension was an \\"error\\". In October 2016, Southern had her gender legally changed to male as part of a video produced for The Rebel Media to show the ease of Ontario's new gender ID laws.Tamara Wernli: Total durchgeknallt . Basler Zeitung (in German). 1 December 2016. In 2016, Southern authored and self-published Barbarians: How Baby Boomers, Immigrants, and Islam Screwed My Generation. In January 2017, Southern posted to Twitter incorrect rumours from the website 4chan that the Quebec City mosque shooting had been carried out by Syrian refugees; she later deleted those tweets. In March 2017, Southern announced she would be leaving The Rebel Media to become an independent journalist. In the same month, she gained access to White House press briefings. In April 2017, Southern was one of several scheduled speakers at a Patriots' Day rally in Berkeley, California. The rally led to a riot between pro-Trump demonstrators and anti-Trump counter-protesters. =Opposition to NGOs, refugees, and migration= In May 2017, Southern, along with Martin Sellner and Brittany Sellner (nee Pettibone), took part in an attempt organized by the Identitarian group G√©n√©ration identitare to block the passage of an NGO ship, the Aquarius (co-owned by SOS Mediterran√©e and by Doctors without Borders), which was leaving Sicily to start a search-and-rescue mission for ship-wrecked refugees and migrants off the shores of Northern Africa. Claiming that the goal of the activists \\"was to stop an empty boat from going down to Libya and filling up with illegal migrants\\", Southern was briefly detained by the Italian Coast Guard. NGO ships often rescue migrants and refugees, who disembark from Libyan shores on unsafe makeshift rafts, and bring them to Sicily.Claudio Cartaldo: Migranti, blitz contro l'Ong (in Italian). In: il Giornale, 13 May 2017. Regarding her actions, Southern stated: \\"if the politicians won't stop the boats, we'll stop the boats.\\" Southern supported similar actions by Defend Europe, which chartered a vessel to track and stop what it called collusion between NGOs and human traffickers. In July 2017, Southern revealed that Patreon had deleted her account citing concerns about her \\"raising funds in order to take part in activities that are likely to cause loss of life\\". Southern denied these allegations, stating that Defend Europe's actions were likely to save lives and that none of her funding went towards the group. In November 2018, Southern released a video that appeared to show an NGO worker admitting that she had coached asylum seekers on how to speak to immigration officials in order to gain refugee status. BuzzFeed News reported that a UNHCR spokesperson said: \\"Greece has rigorous asylum procedures in place, within a robust legal framework.\\" In May 2019, Southern released a YouTube documentary, Borderless, about the refugee and migrant crisis. The film was temporarily taken down by YouTube. =Ban on entering the United Kingdom= In February 2018, Southern, along with Brittany Pettibone and Caolan Robertson, distributed flyers in the English town of Luton describing Allah as \\"gay\\", as part of a \\"social experiment\\" video. In March 2018, Southern, Pettibone, and Identitarian activist Martin Sellner were all denied entry to the United Kingdom. Southern was also questioned under the Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000. Her denial of entry was due to her intentions during her March visit and on the same grounds as Pettibone and Sellner. =2018 Australian tour= Shortly before a planned speaking tour of Australia in July 2018, Australia's Department of Home Affairs denied Lauren Southern an Electronic Travel Authority visa, saying it was \\"not a working visa\\". She intended to charge $79 for a basic ticket and up to $749 for an \\"intimate dinner\\". The Australian government allowed her to enter the country once she had the correct visa. Arriving at Brisbane airport, she was wearing an \\"It's OK to be white\\" shirt. When she asked people on the street in Melbourne \\"Should we kill Lauren Southern?\\", many had never heard of her. A speaking event in Melbourne was opposed by more than 100 protestors. There were no protestors at her event in Sydney, where ticket holders were notified of the venue by receiving a text on the day. The Sydney event included a $200 meet-and-greet, a $500 VIP meet-and-greet and a $750 dinner. In Brisbane, Southern mentioned bombing the Australian city of Melbourne, quoting the Bible, as a joke. She was opposed by around 60 protesters. =2018 New Zealand tour= In July 2018, Southern applied for a travel visa to visit New Zealand for a speaking tour with Canadian podcaster and YouTuber Stefan Molyneux. Immigration Minister Iain Lees-Galloway described their views as \\"repugnant\\", but said they met immigration character requirements and cleared their entry. The pair had not secured a venue, as Auckland Council had cancelled their initial booking, citing health and safety concerns. The pair briefly cancelled and then resumed the tour over difficulties with the venue. The subsequent booking of a private venue was revoked by its owners. In retaliation, their venue was vandalised. The failure to find a venue was celebrated by around 1,000 protestors, who said the planned event had nothing to do with freedom of speech. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said Southern's views \\"are not those that are shared by this country\\". In August 2018, the Mayor of Auckland Phil Goff tweeted that Council venues should not be used to \\"stir up ethnic or religious tensions\\", and that \\"we've got no obligation at all\\" to provide a venue for hate speech. For agreeing with the cancellation, an MP received threats of violence. TƒÅmaki Anti Fascist Action spokesperson Sina Brown-Davis said her group feared \\"dehumanising depictions of indigenous people\\" in New Zealand. Molyneux had called Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people \\"the lowest rung of civilisation\\". Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said New Zealand is \\"hostile\\" to the views of the speakers and \\"I think you'll see from the reaction they've had from New Zealanders that their views are not those that are shared by this country, and I'm quite proud of that\\". Green Party co- leader Marama Davidson added \\"Aotearoa does not stand for your messages of racism, hatred and especially white supremacy\\". Justice Minister Andrew Little said the speakers \\"clearly have misled people\\" in trying to secure the venue. TV personality Te Hamua Nikora said the pair were against multiculturalism, unlike New Zealand. The minimum ticket price for the cancelled Auckland event was $99. = Brief retirement= On 2 June 2019, Southern announced her retirement from political activism in her website. She stated that her reasons for leaving were that she needed to move on and find fulfillment in a more private capacity. On 19 June 2020, Southern announced in a YouTube video her return and new plans, expressing some remorse for her previous hardline stances. She was invited to speak at the Australian Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) 2020, to be held on 4 November 2020, but in October 2020 it was announced that her invitation had been rescinded by the organisers. Views Southern has been widely described as alt-right, far- right and right-wing. She rejects the label \\"alt-right\\". The Southern Poverty Law Center has described Southern's videos as antifeminist, xenophobic, Islamophobic and borderline white nationalist. She is anti-multicultural and has called the Black Lives Matter movement a \\"terrorist organisation\\". =Gender= Southern said transgender people have a \\"genuine delusion\\" adding \\"It‚Äôs body dysmorphia and that is a mental illness\\". She criticised legal recognition for changing one's gender, because people doing so might be \\"dishonest\\". Southern has spoken in opposition to feminism and has said that women are \\"not psychologically developed to hold leadership positions\\", and \\"not going to be as great being CEOs\\". In 2015 she attended SlutWalk and held a sign that read, \\"There is no rape culture in the West.\\" She also said that it was \\"insane\\" to focus on the issue. =Multiculturalism= Southern is against multiculturalism. She has asked whether a multicultural society would require \\"witch doctors\\" at medical conferences, and has claimed that \\"multiculturalism will inevitably fail unless 50 per cent of the population believes in Western culture\\". New Matilda reported that the core message of her 2018 speaking tour of Australia was that \\"multiculturalism doesn't work\\". On the tour, she caused controversy for publicly criticizing an \\"Asian only\\" room-share advert that she had photographed and called it \\"extremely tribalistic\\". This was an attempt to highlight the supposed failure of multiculturalism, by suggesting that it produced a form of \\"segregation\\". =Race= Southern has defended the American neo-Nazi Richard B. Spencer, who had said \\"Hail Trump\\" in a speech at a white nationalist gathering, and had called for a \\"peaceful\\" ethnic cleansing of America. Southern has said \\"Richard Spencer is not a white supremacist, he is a white nationalist.

In 2018, Southern produced a documentary called Farmlands which claimed that racially motivated farm attacks in South Africa may represent an impending genocide, a common talking point for white nationalists. While producing the documentary, Southern worked with Charlottesville Unite the Right rally attendee Simon Roche, a spokesperson for the racist, ethnonationalist (v√∂lkisch) Afrikaner organization Suidlanders. In 2017, Southern produced a video on the Great Replacement conspiracy theory, which posits that non-white immigration will lead to a \\"genocide\\" of white Europeans.

He was one of the leading cotton merchants in Malta, and was a popular figure on the island. As part of his business, he used to sell products called brared (singular: barrada) and thus originated his nickname. When the Maltese rebelled against the French occupation in 1798, Brared was chosen by the inhabitants of Birkirkara and Mosta as their leader. He was in charge of the largest battalion among the insurgent army, and became one of the main leaders in the uprising, along with Emmanuele Vitale and Francesco Saverio Caruana. He has financed a number of soldiers throughout the blockade. Ta' Xindi Farmhouse, Brared's field headquarters in 1798‚Äì1800 Throughout the blockade, capomastri under Brared's command built a number of batteries to bombard French positions and prevent a counterattack, including Gƒßargƒßar Battery, Ta' Gƒßemmuna Battery and several batteries at Sliema. Brared had his field headquarters at Ta' Xindi Farmhouse, today one of the few surviving landmarks of the blockade. On 4 February 1799, Brared suggested to Captain Alexander Ball that Malta be placed under British protection, and he hoisted the first British flag on the island. On 2 February 1801, Brared was awarded the gold Pro Patria medal in recognition of his role in the blockade. He became the lieutenant of Birkirkara and Mosta from 1801 to 1804. He quarreled with Ball in January 1804 due to alleged political intrigues, and was placed under house arrest. He was made a knight of the Order of St Michael and St George on 9 February 1833.

It is mainly found in the south of Manawatu but may also be found along the east coast of the South Island. A bioluminescent worm, Octochaetus multiporus secretes a luminescent fluid from its mouth when disturbed or punctured.  Taxonomy  The New Zealand earthworm was first described by Frank Evers Beddard in 1885. It is the type- species and type-genus of Octochaetidae, a family of earthworms mainly confined to the Australasian region, with the long anticipated \\"missing-link\\" between octochaetids in New Zealand and India found recently with Octochaetus ambrosensis (Blakemore, 1997) and its allied taxa in Australia.  Description  Octochaetus multiporus is pale pink in colour, with a translucent body wall and a purple streak that runs along the top midline of the body. The clitellum (a glandular section on the wall of the body, which holds eggs) and length are also unique to the worm and help with identification as it can grow up to and can get a diameter of . The New Zealand Earthworm has clitella on 14-19th segments, which can extend and overlap onto the 13 and 20th segments (Lee 1959). The New Zealand Earthworm has strong muscles in the anterior and posterior for burrowing but a weak body. The majority of the earthworm‚Äôs muscles are present in the anterior and the posterior of the body (head and anus) as this allows for optimum burrowing ability. This helps with the worms capacity to improve soil structure in pastures and native woodland.  Distribution and habitat  Octochaetus multiporus is endemic to New Zealand, meaning it can only be found in New Zealand and nowhere else globally. Octochaetus multiporus has one of the highest populations of New Zealand‚Äôs native earthworm species and have related species in the same family across India and in Australia Found mainly in pastureland of the south of Manawatu, (North Island), O. multiporus is also found down the east coast of the South Island and on Stewart Island. They are found in the subsoil of New Zealand‚Äôs native forests, tussock land and pastureland which is not affected by deforestation and chemical pollution. They are found in the native forests of these areas, as this is their natural habitat before colonization and heavy soil impact. The New Zealand Earthworm is found in greater numbers in soils sloping away from the sun as this allows for high ventilation and soil moisture for the optimum habitat of the worm. O. multiporus are found in highest numbers in low to moderate soil fertility levels. Experiments have been done to analyse their behaviors in pastureland using key plants of Chicory and Clover, burrowing under them in a horizontal pattern. General worms have a very small temperature range between optimum living and death, which also related to the O. multiporus. The optimum temperature for most earthworms is and are threatened at temperatures of .Edwards, C. A. (2004). Earthworm Ecology (Second ed.). CRC Press LLS  Life cycle and ecology  Because of its abundance, O. multiporus has been the subject of much research, but despite this there is not a lot of information found on its life cycle = Diet = Earthworms feed on dead and decaying matter in the soil e.g. roots and leaves, aerating the soil and breaking down organic matter creating a valuable type of fertilizer. The soils best suited for O. multiporus are in the Southern Manawatu Region, east coast of the South Island and Stewart Island.Yeates, G. (2012, 11 21). Earthworms ‚Äì Earthworms and Soil. Retrieved from Te Ara ‚Äì the Encyclopedia of New Zealand O. multiporus relies less on native vegetation than other native worms. = Predators and diseases = In New Zealand, the main predators of earthworms are introduced bird species that live on the pastureland in which O. multiporus lives. These species include gulls, starlings and magpies, which are all introduced into New Zealand. In the native forests of New Zealand, O. multiporus is a key part of the kiwi's diet as it lives on the forest floor looking for bugs and worms in the soil. Much research has been done to find out what parasites are hosted by or harm earthworms, but not much information has been found about what harm they cause. These parasites include bacteria, fungi, mites and other parasite-like organisms.  Relationship to humans  Earthworms are important to New Zealand agriculture and native bush systems. They provide a vital service to improving the soil structure, particularly when summer pastures are moist and there is an absence of introduced lumbricid earthworms O. multiporus is a species that is of great interest to the scientific community due to its unique defence mechanisms. When threatened, O. multiporus squirts a luminescent fluid from its mouth. The luminescent fluid helps to indicate the maturity of the worm, changing colour varying from blue to yellow/orange. In addition to releasing the fluid, this worm itself is bioluminescent.

He is known as a singer and a piano and organ player.Frank Robson in elonet He first came to Finland in 1967. Robson had met some Finns in a London pub, and someone had given him their phone number. When Robson's band subsequently was on tour in Scandinavia, he found himself in Stockholm and got an idea to call the Finnish number. As a result of this, he found himself in Finland. At that time there was a demand for rock musicians in Finland who had English as their native language, especially for someone with experience from the music circles in London. It is said that in London he had played with the Small Faces. In Finland, Robson was quickly employed by a band named Mosaic, as their lead singer Kirill Babitzin had just gone solo under the name Kirka. Mosaic made a single, both songs on which were penned by Robson. Next Robson was asked to join Blues Section, to fill in for Jim Pembroke. With Blues Section Robson likewise made a single. During the summer of 1968 Robson played 50 gigs with Blues Section, and after the summer the band broke up and Robson returned to England. Robson had thought he had gone home for good, but soon he was called back to Finland, to join a new group, the Tasavallan Presidentti. He played and sang lead vocals on their first two albums, but before the third one he was fired. This was unfortunate, as the band would now go on to play some high profile gigs in Robson's native England. However, he later got another chance, when the band was reformed in 1999 and made one more album, Six Complete, in 2006. The songs on this album were penned by Robson and Jukka Tolonen. Robson has released five solo albums. He hopes to do at least one more, although in 2013 he was diagnosed with a cancer of the pharynx. After a number of operations, his voice is not what it used to be, but he sounds hopeful, saying that \\"it's somewhere between Joe Cocker and Louis Armstrong.\\" Also his first two albums, Robson and Stay Awhile are about to be re-released by the Finnish record company Svart Records. The same company will also put out a collection of Robson's early singles, with a total of 14 songs. Robson has two daughters, of which one, Jenny Robson, is also a singer.

The genus contains a single species, Paradoxosisyra groehni and is placed into the extinct subfamily Paradoxosisyrinae. Paradoxosisyra is known from a solitary Middle Cretaceous fossil which was found in Asia. History and classification Paradoxosisyra is known from one adult fossil, the holotype, specimen number \\"GPIH Typ. Kat. Nr. 4580\\". At the time of the genus description, the specimen was residing in the Geological-Paleontological Institute and Museum's C. Gr√∂hn collection, part of the University of Hamburg. The described specimen is an adult female which has been preserved as an inclusion in a transparent chunk of Burmese amber. The amber specimens were recovered from deposits in Kachin State, in Myanmar. Burmese amber has been radiometrically dated using U-Pb isotopes, yielding an age of approximately 98.79 ¬± 0.62 million years old, close to the Aptian ‚Äì Cenomanian boundary, in the earliest Cenomanian. The fossil was first described by the Russian paleoentomologist Vladimir Makarkin of the Far East Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Makarkin's 2016 type description of the new genus and species was published in the journal Cretaceous Research. The genus name Paradoxosisyra was coined as a combination of the modern genus name Sisyra and the Greek word \\"paradoxos\\" meaning strange, in allusion to the unique mouth- parts not seen in any other member of the family. The specific epithet groehni was coined as a patronym honoring the amber collector Carsten Gr√∂hn who collected and promoted the study of Baltic amber. Paradoxosisyra is one of three Sisyridae genera described from the fossil record, the others being the Cretaceous Prosisyrina from Taimyr amber and the Eocene Paleosisyra from Baltic amber. Due to the different structure of the mouthparts from other members of Sisyridae, Makarkin erected a new subfamily Paradoxosisyrinae for the genus, placing the other genera into the subfamily Sisyrinae. Description While the placement and structure of the gonocoxites on the females abdomen and the general wing venation are most similar to genera of Sisyridae, a number of characters distinguish Pa. groehni. Most notably the mouthparts are fused and modified into an extremely elongated siphon-like tube. All the other described genera in Sisyridae have adults with mandible structured mouthparts used for chewing or biting. There are several raised dome like calluses that are covered in setae and unlike other member of Sisyridae, the pronotum sclerite is present.

His work in aircraft camouflage has transformed the approach to painting US military aircraft.  Biography  Douglas B-18A Bolo, the aircraft in which Ferris' father gave him his first flight on his tenth birthday. Carlisle Keith Ferris was born on May 14, 1929 in Honolulu to Carlisle and Virginia (n√©e Brecht) Ferris when his father was an Army Air Corps lieutenant stationed at the Luke Field, Ford Island in Pearl Harbor. In the same year, the father transferred to the Advanced Flying School at Kelly Field, Texas as a flight instructor. There his parents had three more children. His father was a combat pilot instructor for six years at Kelly Field, during which time Ferris became exposed to and interested in military aircraft. Next after the father's further advancements in the Army Air Corps, the family moved to March Field, near Riverside, California. To celebrate his tenth birthday, Ferris' first flight was in a Douglas B-18A to which his father had been assigned. In 1946, Ferris entered Texas A&M; University to study aeronautical engineering and a hoped-for career path towards an Air Force commission. He encountered his first jet fighter at Randolph Air Force Base in Texas, while working in a summer job there. After learning that a minor allergy would make him ineligible to become a military pilot, he transferred to George Washington University, where he also studied anatomy and figure drawing at the Corcoran College of Art. Upon completion of his studies, he moved to St. Louis in 1951 to work for firms with publications contracts for the United States Air Force. For five years he was in charge of producing artwork for training publications and nuclear weapons manuals until the Air Force closed that operation. He then moved to the New York area to become a freelance artist for the aerospace industry and the military. He married Peggy Todd in 1953, while in St. Louis, which union produced a daughter and a son.  Career  Ferris painting his \\"Fortresses Under Fire\\" mural at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum. = Aviation art = Ferris' work has been displayed at venues that include the Air Force Art Collection in The Pentagon, the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. and the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force; and in aviation art publications. The art director of Aviation Week & Space Technology cited \\"the power and the majesty of aviation in his paintings\\". A director of the National Air and Space Museum cited his \\"absolute fidelity to accuracy\\" and called him \\"the (Frederic) Remington of our time\\". A pilot and fellow artist said that his paintings \\"capture the impression of flight as a pilot would get: the airiness around you, the impression of movement\\". His work has influenced artists as far afield as Pakistan. In a 1994 interview for AOPA Pilot magazine, Ferris suggested three rules of thumb for good aviation art: # Painting vs. photography: \\"If it can be handled by a photographer, I'm not interested in spending my time doing the same thing with paint.\\" # From across a room: \\"If you can tell at a glance what is going on, what it is and what it is doing, then it is pretty good art\\". # Develop the shadows in aircraft imagery: \\"Airplanes are like a big mirror; they reflect the surrounding environment in their surfaces.\\" In a 2001 interview for The New York Times, Ferris highlighted the advantage of an artist over a photographer by pointing out that, as an artist he can start with nothing and using his imagination turn it into something, as opposed to a photographer who must have an object or scene to photograph. He further explained that his process of creating his works begins with a \\"debriefing\\" of his Air Force-sponsored travels to his wife, leading to thumbnail sketches, then to various views of the aircraft mission to be portrayed and finally to scaling all objects to appear in the scene using an engineering process called, perspective projection by descriptive geometry; this includes careful consideration of the aircraft's flight path relative to the viewer's position. Key to the three dimensional effect is the handling of light and reflected light within the composition. Ferris and his wife operate a small business, offering his original art and prints of his work for sale.  Air Force Art Program  Ferris with three Air Force instructor pilots, following an Air Force Art Program flight. His participation in the Air Force Art Program allowed Ferris to travel worldwide and to document the missions of many of the Air Force's jet aircraft, providing 62 major paintings to the collection. The program provided opportunities to fly in a wide variety of Air Force planes over more than 40 years, including in B-52s, the F-4E Phantom in Thailand, with the United States Air Force Thunderbirds flight demonstration team, and on Air Force missions during the Bosnian Conflict. His subject matter documents aviation history from World War I through the current era.  Murals  Ferris mural, \\"The Evolution of Jet Aviation\\", at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum Ferris created two murals for the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum, \\"Fortresses Under Fire\\" in the museum's World War II gallery and \\"The Evolution of Jet Aviation\\" in the museum's Jet Aviation gallery. His best-known work, the by mural \\"Fortresses Under Fire\\", depicts with historical accuracy a World War II Boeing B-17 \\"Flying Fortress\\" bomber, named Thunderbird, under attack during its 70th mission on 15 August 1944. In a 1989 interview with The New York Times, Ferris described how he scaled up the working image, using a grid system‚Äîwith fine squares for the working image and coarse squares for the mural‚Äîand completed each portion working from left to right, using correspondingly larger paint brushes. The mural took approximately 135 days of planning and 75 days of execution. Ferris visits his mural ‚ÄúFortresses Under Fire‚Äù at the National Air and Space Museum in 2005. The second mural, \\"The Evolution of Jet Aviation\\", depicts 27 historically significant jet aircraft, including the first and the fastest, and models from eight nations and from 20 aircraft manufacturers. = Professional societies = Ferris joined the Society of Illustrators in New York City in 1960, which introduced him to the Air Force Art Program. He is a founder and past president of the American Society of Aviation Artists, established with the stated goal to \\"promote professionalism, authenticity and quality in aviation art\\"; the society also provides scholarships, annual educational forums, advice on business practices, and opportunities for exhibition. = Camouflage = Ferris applied his knowledge of aircraft, his substantial experience with flying on missions in military aircraft, combined with his artistic talent, to developing several innovative camouflage patterns for military aircraft. He obtained five patents, covering these camouflage patterns. One design involved painting a false cockpit on the underside of an aircraft to make it more difficult for an adversary to determine which way the aircraft was turning. Another design, using disruptive coloration, entailed applying three shades of gray in a jagged pattern. Key principles included elimination of both bright colors and black from color schemes, the use of gray tones with a matte finish, the use of asymmetric patterns, and the de- emphasis of insignias. A third design principle creates visual confusion as an aircraft moves over a background. Ferris-inspired camouflage schemes have been implemented on foreign aircraft, as well.

The book is subtitled Prostitution and Religious Obedience in the Bible, and is made up of adaptations of stories from the Bible that Brown believes promote pro-prostitution attitudes among early Christians. Content As in his previous graphic novel Paying for It (2011), Brown takes a pro-prostitution stance in Mary Wept Over the Feet of Jesus. He declares his research has determined that Mary, mother of Jesus, was a prostitute, that early Christians practised prostitution, and that Jesus' Parable of the Talents should be read in a pro-prostitution light. Brown describes himself as a Christian who is \\"not at all concerned with imposing 'moral' values or religious laws on others\\" and believes that Biblical figures such as Abel and Job \\"find favour with God because they oppose his will or challenge him in some way\\". Brown adapts the stories or portions of stories of Cain and Abel, Tamar, Rahab, Ruth, Bathsheba, Mary, mother of Jesus, the Parable of the talents, Mary of Bethany, Matthew, and the Parable of the Prodigal Son. Handwritten appendices make up the final third of the book, including commentary on the comics, a 55-title bibliography, and a 20-page comics adaptation of the Book of Job. Analysis Brown lays out the simple, precise artwork in a fixed grid of four panels to a page. The dialogue is plain and direct. The cover features a vagina-shaped frame into which Brown incorporates two smiling snakes and an open book, from which red drops fall. In the book's appendices, Brown puts forth his interpretations of the stories. He argues that prostitution had an honorable place in Biblical society, and that Matthew left clues in his narrative that Mary was a prostitute. Brown details facts from his research that coloured his interpretations, such as that feet was used as a euphemism for \\"penis\\". He also tells of where he used artistic license in his retellings, and of errors he made, such as depicting coins at a time when coins had not yet come into use.

It was first proposed in 1990 based on the research conducted on classifications of offender treatments by Lee Sechrest and Ted Palmer, among other researchers, in the 1960s and 70s. It was primarily developed by Canadian researchers James Bonta, Donald A. Andrews, and Paul Gendreau. It has been considered the best model that exists for determining offender treatment, and some of the best risk-assessment tools used on offenders are based on it. Core Principles According to the model, there are three main principles that should guide interventions for helping offenders reduce involvement in crime: # Risk principle: Offenders differ in their risk of recidivism, therefore different kinds of interventions are appropriate. When the risk is low, complex (and expensive) interventions may be unreasonable. On the other hand, for high-risk offenders intensive interventions are likely necessary to induce any kind of change. # Need principle: Every offender naturally has their own set of dynamic risk factors or criminogenic needs. When changed, they predict changes in reoffending rates. Therefore, interventions should target these individual needs for best results. # Responsivity principle: Thirdly, different modes of intervention differ in their effectiveness of reducing recidivism. Generally, behavioural and cognitive-behavioural interventions are preferred. There is also an interaction with attributes of the offender: depending on e.g. age, gender, cognitive abilities or motivation different kinds of interventions are indicated.

This is special branch of control that has an emphasis on the interaction between humans and robotics. Background Basic control block diagram used in the designing of controllers for a system. Back in the 1970 several researchers developed a tethered electrohydraulic transfemoral prosthesis.Grimes, D. L. (1979). An active multi-mode above knee prosthesis controller. PhD Thesis, Cambridge, MA, MIT, Department of Mechanical Engineering.Donath, M. (1974). Proportional EMG control for above- knee prosthesis. Master‚Äôs Thesis Cambridge, MA, MIT, Department of Mechanical EngineeringFlowers, W. C. (1973). A man-interactive simulator system forabove- knee prosthetics studies. PhD Thesis, Cambridge, MA, MIT, Department of Mechanical Engineering. It only included a hydraulically actuated knee joint controlled by off-board electronics using a type of control called echo control. Echo control tries to take the kinematics from the sound leg and control the prosthetic leg to match the intact leg when it reaches that part of the gait cycle. In 1988 a battery-powered active knee joint powered by DC motors and controlled by a robust position tracking control algorithm was created by Popovic and Schwirtlich.Popovic, D. and Schwirtlich, L. (1988). Belgrade active A/K prosthesis. Electrophysiological Kinesiology (International Congress Series, No. 804), de Vries, J. (ed.). Amsterdam, Excerpta Medica, pp. 337‚Äì343Au, S., Bonato, P.and Herr, H. (2005).An EMG- position controlled system for an active ankle-foot prosthesis: an initial experimental study. Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics, pp. 375‚Äì379 Tracking control is a common method of control used to force a particular state, such as position, velocity, or torque, to track a particular trajectory. These are just two examples of previous work that has been done in this field. Lower limb control = Impedance control = This form of control is an approach used to control the dynamic interactions between the environment and a manipulator.Aghasadeghi, Navid, et al. \\"Learning impedance controller parameters for lower-limb prostheses.\\" Intelligent robots and systems (IROS), 2013 IEEE/RSJ international conference on. IEEE, 2013. This works by treating the environment as an admittance and the manipulator as the impedance.Hogan, Neville. \\"Impedance control: An approach to manipulation.\\" American Control Conference, 1984. IEEE, 1984. The relationship this imposes for robotic prosthesis the relationship in between force production in response to the motion imposed by the environment. This translates into the torque required at each joint during a single stride, represented as a series of passive impedance functions piece wise connected over a gait cycle. Impedance control doesn't regulate force or position independently, instead it regulates the relationship between force and position and velocity. To Design an impedance controller, a regression analysis of gait data is used to parameterize an impedance function. For lower limb prosthesis the impedance function looks similar to the following equation. \\\\tau = k(\\\\theta-\\\\theta{\\\\scriptstyle\\\\text{0}}) + b\\\\dot{\\\\theta}Hugh Herr demonstrating new robotic prosthetic legs at TED 2014: \\"That was the first demonstration of a running gait under neural command. The more I fire my muscles, the more torque I get.\\"The terms k (spring stiffness), Œ∏0 (equilibrium angle), and b (dampening coefficient) are all parameters found through regression and tuned for different parts of the gait cycle and for a specific speed. This relationship is then programmed into a micro controller to determine the required torque at different parts of the walking phase. = Myoelectric control = Electromyography (EMG) is a technique used for evaluating and recording the electrical activity produced by skeletal muscles.Kamen, Gary. Electromyographic Kinesiology. In Robertson, DGE et al. Research Methods in Biomechanics. Champaign, IL: Human Kinetics Publ., 2004. Advanced pattern recognition algorithms can take these recordings and decode the unique EMG signal patterns generated by muscles during specific movements. The patterns can be used to determine the intent of the user and provide control for a prosthetic limb. For lower limb robotic prosthesis it is important to be able to determine if the user wants to walk on level ground, up a slope, or up stairs. Currently this is where myoelectric control comes intro play. During transitions between these different modes of operation EMG signal becomes highly variable and can be used to complement information from mechanical sensors to determine the intended mode of operation. Each patient that uses a robotic prosthesis that is tuned for this type of control has to have their system trained for them specifically. This is done by having them go through the different modes of operation and using that data to train their pattern recognition algorithm. = Speed-adaptation mechanism = The speed-adaption mechanism is a mechanism used to determine the required torque from the joints at different moving speeds. During the stance phase it has been seen that quasistiffness, which is the derivative of the torque angle relationship with respect the angle, changes constantly as a function of walking speed. This means that over the stance phase, depending on the speed the subject is moving, there is a derivable torque angle relationship that can be used to control a lower limb prosthesis. During the swing phase joint torque increases proportionally to walking speed and the duration of the swing phase decreases proportionally to the stride time. These properties allow for trajectories to be derived that can be controlled around that accurately describe the angle trajectory over the swing phase. Because these two mechanism remain constant from person to person this method removes the speed and patient specific tuning required by most lower limb prosthetic controllers. = Model- independent quadratic programs (MIQP)+Impedance control = Walking gait is classified as hybrid system, meaning that it has split dynamics. With this unique problem, a set of solutions to hybrid systems that undergo impacts was developed called Rapid Exponentially Stabilizing Control Lyapunov Functions(RES-CLF). Control Lyapunov function are used to stabilize a nonlinear system to a desired set of states. RES-CLFs can be realized using quadratic programs that take in several inequality constraints and return an optimal output. One problem with these are that they require a model of the system to develop the RES-CLFs. To remove the need of tuning to specific individuals Model Independent Quadratic Programs (MIQP) were used to derive CLFs. These CLFs are only focused on reducing the error in the desired output without any knowledge of what the desired torque should be. To provide this information an impedance control is added to provide a feed forward term that allows the MIQP to gather information about the system it is controlling without having a full model of the system.  Upper limb control  Commercial solutions exploit superficial EMG signals to control the prosthesis. Furthermore, researchers are investigating alternative solutions that exploit different biological sources: * implanted electrodes (neural, intramuscular and epymisial electrodes) to record neural or muscle activity; * pressure sensor matrices to detect force changes during muscle contraction; * the myokinetic approach to measure muscle deformation. = Myokinetic control = Myokinetic control represents an alternative to standard myoelectric control. It aims at measuring muscle deformation during contraction instead of muscle electrical activity. A novel approach recently emerged in 2017 which is based on sensing the magnetic field of permanent magnets directly implanted into residual muscles. Localizing the position of the magnet is equivalent to measuring the contraction/elongation of the muscle it is implanted in as the magnet moves with it. This information can be used to interpret the voluntary movement of the subject and consequently control the prosthesis. The magnetic signals generated by the magnets are detected by external sensors placed around the residual limb. Localization is then implemented by an optimization method that performs the tracking by solving the magnetic inverse problem (e.g., Levenberg‚ÄìMarquardt algorithm). = End-to-end control = In the end- to-end control, raw electromyography (EMG) signals pass trough a convolutional neural network to map to hand or joint position. This position can applied as input of actuator driver of prosthesis .. The goal of end-to-end control is to omit feature engineering to maximize the accuracy.

The game on PC was released on October 4, 2017. Console versions of Road Redemption were released on November 6, 2018 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. Gameplay The game is a spiritual successor to the Road Rash series of vehicular combat racing video games. The game aims to replicate the arcade-like simplicity and silliness of the Road Rash games, while introducing more modern graphics and gameplay mechanics. In addition to the melee weapons featured in Road Rash, Road Redemption introduces firearms in the players options for weapons as well. The game will feature split screen multiplayer modes, including the computer-based ones, which is more of a rarity for the platform. The proposed Wii U version would have also featured the ability for multiplayer sessions to take place with one player on the television and the other using just the Wii U GamePad screen. Development In 2009, Ian Fisch, a long time fan of the Road Rash series wrote a blog post on why the game needed a revival. He had intended for the blog post to be a call for developers Electronic Arts to revisit the series, but following the commercial failures of racing/combat hybrids such as Split/Second and Blur, he believed there would be no appetite for such game from an established publisher, so began working on his own take on the game. The game was first announced April 2013, alongside a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign. The campaign raised over $173,000, successfully exceeding its $160,000 goal. While the game was funded for development, it missed the 198,000 stretch goal for a virtual reality Oculus Rift version. Paul Fisch, a developer on the game elaborated on reasons why their Kickstarter campaign did not \\"take off\\" in a piece for The Penny Arcade Report. In it, he blamed the timing of the campaign launch and general crowdfunding fatigue. The game was initially intended for an August 2014 release, which was pushed back to November 2014 at the release of the alpha version in April 2014. While an early beta version was released through Steam Early Access in September 2014, the game missed its 2014 release date, and a lack of further updates in 2015 lead to fears of the game being cancelled. An update in April 2016 clarified that development was still proceeding, with a Q3 2016 release date planned for Microsoft Windows, macOS and Linux. PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Wii U versions are planned for sometime afterwards. Initial 2016 updates did not mention the Wii U as a platform, again causing speculation towards cancellation of that particular version, but DarkSeas Games clarified that the Wii U version was still planned, but was relegated to a release window after the PS4 and Xbox One versions, citing extra work that would have to be done to get the game running on the less-powerful Wii U. In May 2018, DarkSeas Game announced they had shifted development to a Nintendo Switch release. After the game's release, DarkSeas Game's also intends on making the game open-source, allowing for people to create mods for the game. DarkSeas Game's also teamed up with Yacht Club Games to bring their Shovel Knight character to the game as a playable character. Reception =Pre-release= In Eurogamer's Steam Early Access review of the game, Dan Whitehead praised the game despite its quirks and glitches, stating \\"There are a lot of problems, in other words, and the development team has a lot of balancing and polishing to do if Road Redemption is to become a genuinely satisfying and well-rounded successor to its inspiration. Yet for all of the scruffiness, rough edges and half-baked ideas, the game works brilliantly where it matters.\\" Polygon referred to the same early build as \\"a crazier, deeper Road Rash\\" that was \\"as fast, crazed and violent as its obvious inspiration.\\" The game's $40 price point for an alpha release caught criticism from some websites.

He participated in several renowned events, such as the Prix du livre politique, organized since 1991 by association Lire la soci√©t√© at the National Assembly.  Biography  Lassy Mbouity was born into a poor family from Pointe-Noire, the economic capital of the Republic of Congo with a population of over 715,334 inhabitants. He is a native of the Kingdom of Loango which was a pre-colonial state on the coast of Central Africa, founded at the turn of the fifteenth century and abolished in 1885. He went to College Lyc√©e Victor Augagneur in Pointe-Noire where he spent his childhood and studied English in the United States of America. Career Lassy Mbouity was one of the most popular community leaders in Africa and Congo for organizing campaigns for young people across Africa, in order to educate the new generation. After publishing the book Africa after Asia in 2009, this Congolese writer has indeed stored behind the Europeen Economical strategy. In June 2008, Mbouity was appointed as the General Secretary of the Congolese Student Association in West Africa (Association des √©l√®ves et √©tudiants Congolais), and claimed to be economically free by promising to keep defending the interests of the Congolese people in his books, but also those of young, which remains one of the mainstays. Mbouity makes regular visits to the French president Fran√ßois Hollande and American political leaders such as Rand Paul. Mbouity, through its accompanying program of youth education, attempts to provide boys and girls with the essential knowledge to become informed educators. The latter will be able to ensure the education of future generations and offer Africa a promising future. Community Organizing Through his organization, Lassy Mbouity tried to demonstrate why the revolution of education is very important in Africa. He said during an interview in Benin that from the time when African traditions are giving way to civilization through colonization that has been very positive and less negative for Africans, the transmission of knowledge is the most important for the future of Africa. Mbouity Lassy is an active member of the Congolese Party of Labour, founded in 1969 by former President Marien Ngouabi. In his book African Engaged or Disaged he stated that: African presidents in general should make an effort to invest in the next generation of young African leaders. One of my peculiarities is to transfer life skills to young Africans so that they can change their present and get a better future.

Early life Philip Zuchman was born in Queens, New York and started painting when he was seven years old. At age 14 Zuchman's mother died and he left home to live in various lofts around New York City. At age 18, he and a friend built kayaks for themselves and paddled from Bordentown, N.J. to the Carolina Sea Islands. Education and writing career Although Zuchman did not finish high school, Queens College accepted him in 1961. He studied philosophy and writing there, graduating in 1965. He won the Peter Pauper Press Award for two novelettes: Father Never Went to Church But Loved the Soil and A Mass for an Ass. In 1966 Zuchman served as a psychological research specialist and French interpreter in the U.S. Army. While stationed in Monterey, California he wrote a script based on O. Henry‚Äôs story \\"The Gift of the Magi\\" that was performed by the Presidio Players in 1966 under the direction of Edward Bach. After his discharge from the army, he returned to Manhattan in 1968 to paint. During this time, he studied with Arthur Foster at the Art Students League of New York. In 1971 the Salmagundi Club awarded him its four-year Young Artist‚Äôs Scholarship. Zuchman moved up to a small farmhouse in Walden, Vermont that year to pursue an MA in painting at Goddard College, (Listed as alumnus) where he studied with James Gahagan. In 1973 he moved to Philadelphia, PA, where he married fellow artist Deborah Gross. Painting career \\"Evening Falls On\\" Zuchman has served as president of the National Forum of Professional Artists, vice president of Philadelphia Artists Equity, and vice president of the Philadelphia Watercolor Society. He was a Professor of Studio Art and Aesthetics, Emeritus, at the Art Institute of Philadelphia until 2013. Zuchman‚Äôs paintings have been exhibited internationally as part of the U.S. State Department‚Äôs Art in Embassies Program, for which he is a Cultural Ambassador. \\"Between the Conception and the Creation\\" Philip Zuchman currently lives in West Philadelphia with his wife, painter Deborah Gross-Zuchman. The couple has restored their 19th century home and studio and occasionally hold arts and culture events there. The house features their paintings, carvings, mosaics and murals.Thornton, John. \\"The Zuchmans, A Marriage of Artists.\\" Jan 1, 2014. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riMSjloikUo In 2013, Philip was named an Honorary Lifetime Member of the Philadelphia Watercolor Society.Philadelphia Watercolor Society Newsletter, August 2013, accessed March 28, 2016. In 2019, the Puffin Foundation awarded Philip a grant for ‚ÄúLamentations,‚Äù a handmade book dedicated to people, past and present, who have suffered from migration, displacement and exile. He received the Albert Nelson Marquis Lifetime Achievement Award in 2020. Artwork Zuchman works primarily with oils and encaustics. For much of his career, he has focused on painting landscapes en plein air. Zuchman explores in his paintings humanity‚Äôs interdependence with nature: \\"Landscapes are political. There are things in landscapes which we don't think of today as symbols--the road that moves through the landscape, the touch of a building, the fence separating borders, the edges of town. All these things combined together give a picture of man's relationship to the environment.\\" His work also explores broader themes such as social ecology, war, and the possibilities of humanism. \\"Artists work to expose the nature of existence, to communicate feelings, to activate consciousness, increase human knowledge, to promote justice, and education. They are activists and pioneers who struggle in their lives against forces of isolation, poverty, discrimination, bad legislation, and being misunderstood by the public,\\" he wrote in his \\"Call to Action.\\" His commitment to art as a social practice has led to his inclusion in several exhibits -- \\"Art From Detritus\\" in NYC and \\"All of Us or None.\\" In 2002, he was featured in Wendy Weinberg's TV special \\"The Art of Activism,\\" where he says, \\"\\"I'm willing to go to great lengths sometimes to make a point. When issues grab a hold of me personally‚Äî issues of taxes that artists have to pay that are prejudicial, issues of censorship‚Äî I get to be a troublemaker. And I'm going to go and write letters and make phone calls. I'm going to do whatever I can do to possibly alter that situation. And I think artists should do this, I think this is very important. We should all be doing the critique of the world we live in.\\" \\"Winter Camping\\" Describing Zuchman‚Äôs use of color in his introduction to Summer on a Hill, Peter London writes, \\"And it is here in his choice of color schemes that Philip is most inventive. The closely matched greens of mid summer are now replaced with a wider range of tones and tints. And these in turn are now given to us in layers of contrasting hues and saturations. The effect of this broadening and layering is to animate the flat surface of the painting to equal the vibrancy of the constantly changing light, the twirling shift of surfaces of the millions of leaves, grasses and clouds, all within yawning depths of space of nature just as it is. The scarlet and rose and mauve and sepia and chartreuse and cerulean of Philip‚Äôs palette replace nature‚Äôs own infinite variations on green. And how nature forms its own endless variety of twigs, pebbles, leaves and grasses is now replaced by Philip‚Äôs wide range of textured application of paint. Smears, glazes, washes, impastos, scumbles, blotches and the like build an uneven surface of the painting making the whole pulsate, again, like the shimmering of the light on any portion of nature‚Äôs beauty.\\"  References  External links * [quote:] This Website is Under Construction!

Containing elements of footwork, bass, grime and 2-step garage, the EP's sound is represented by a worm who goes through several nonsensical lands. To make Chinese N√º Yr, Malliagh first designed the cover art and then developed songs with structures and sound to fit the artwork. Upon release, the EP garnered generally favorable reviews from critics, a common praise being its unique style. Composition Chinese N√º Yr is an electronica album using elements of bass, grime and 2-step garage. Malliagh explained that Chinese N√º Yr is based on a story about 'XiƒÅngjiƒÅo', a gelatinous and amorphous worm who wears a witch hat and is voiced by heavily pitch-shifted and processed recordings of his father and little sister. XiƒÅngjiƒÅo is forced to go through portals in colorful and nonsensical lands, having to dodge things such as peanuts, floating fruit, pink-colored fog, and mountains growing out of the ground. XiƒÅngjiƒÅo fears both the unfamiliarity of future lands and the extreme speed at which it travels. Malliagh described writing the EP's story as if he was scoring a film, first making the cover art for the EP, and then coming up with the structures and sounds of the songs to fit it. He said in an interview with LA Weekly that \\"Marrying music and pictures is the funnest thing ever. There's so many subconscious elements at play. Looking at a 'mega-sick' picture can make even the most crappy, uncool song sound awesome.

Six days later, the label Brainfeeder announced they would release the EP on 30 October 2015. Two days before the release of the EP, the music blog Pigeons & Planes premiered \\"Xiangjiao\\". Iglooghost said the name of the record came from looking at the sky while flying back home from his gig in Rome: \\"The sky looked really weird and for some reason the word Chinese New Year came into my head. I was really happy, because everything seemed super cool, life just seemed really warm and nice. I think the word Chinese New Year sounds warm and cool. I imagine fireworks, red colours and Chinese lanterns.‚Äù Upon its distribution, Chinese N√º Yr garnered positive reviews. Gary Suarez, reviewing for The Quietus, spotlighted the EP's \\"mirthfully manic synthesis of garage, hip hop, footwork, and as-yet undefined (sub)genres\\" that \\"makes him a beatmaker to watch.\\" Both Ryce and Exclaim! critic Ashley Hampson praised Malliagh for making such a unique record while still fitting with the works of other acts on the Brainfeeder label.

It is dedicated to the Virgin Mary under the title of the Madonna della Maria, after an icon kept here. Formerly the episcopal seat of the Diocese of Monopoli, it has been since 1986 a co-cathedral in the Diocese of Conversano-Monopoli. The cathedral was granted the status of a minor basilica in 1921. History The cathedral was erected near the site of a Roman temple and burial site. Work began on it in 1107, but was supposedly halted for the lack of roof beams. A miracle occurred in 1117 when a raft carrying an icon of the Madonna drifted into the harbour. The raft beams were used to construct the roof. The Romanesque structure was not complete until 1442, when it was consecrated. Two of the three bell-towers were damaged during the siege of the Marquis Del Vasto in 1528. The remaining tower collapsed in 1686, killing forty townspeople. By 1693, a new campanile had been erected. In 1738, an endowment by Bishop Giulio Sacchi called for a refurbishment. The old church was razed, and a new church begun in 1742. Work was completed in Baroque style in 1772. In 1921, the cathedral was declared a minor basilica. In 1986, the dioceses of Monopoli and Conversano were joined, making this a co-cathedral. The Chapel of Our Lady of Madia has elaborate polychrome decoration on the altar. The chapel contains two large canvases by Pietro Bardellino, and there are 6 small 18th-century paintings depicting the Life of the Virgin by Michele del Pezzo. A series of four paintings (1732) in the Chapel of the Martyrs by Michelangelo Signorile (painter) recounts the Miracle of the Raft.Website of the cathedral References Category:Roman Catholic cathedrals in Italy Category:Cathedrals in Apulia Category:Churches in the metropolitan city of Bari Category:Neoclassical architecture in Italy Category:18th-century Roman Catholic church buildings Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1772 ","title":"Monopoli Cathedral"},{"id":"50393875","text":"Main hall Dainenbutsu-ji (Â§ßÂøµ‰ªèÂØ∫) is a Buddhist temple in Hirano-ku, Osaka Prefecture, Japan.

It is based on a short story by James Franco, who stars in the film. It was released at the Austin Film Festival on November 2015, then an American release came out April 8, 2016. , all five of the reviews compiled by Rotten Tomatoes are positive, with an average rating of 7 out of 10. Plot Ivan Cohen (Sam Dillon) is a young boy living in Palo Alto, California. The film begins when Ivan is a young boy and his life with his mother, a Russian immigrant, and his American step-father. Ivan appears unsatisfied with his childhood and his step-father is unable to forge a relationship with the boy. Ivan seems unhappy, noting that people only talk to him about his blonde hair, pale skin, and his Russian army jacket, all of which came from his Russian father. Later, when Ivan is a young teen he is seen with his group of working class slacker friends and Ivan is shown to be alienated from them, although a bond appears to have formed with a female friend, Nina. Ivan appears to be jealous of a relationship between his friend Alex and a pretty girl named Kelly. Alex and Kelly's relationship continues into high school where Ivan continues to be bothered by it. In high school Ivan tags along with his group of friends that still include Alex and Nina. Ivan is clearly a follower with this group and does not appear motivated to change his position even though he is clearly not content. One night after the group of friends take acid, they are involved in a minor car accident appearing to have struck an animal. This event shakes up Ivan. During high school one of Ivan's teachers, Mr. Wyckoff (James Franco) appears concerned about Ivan's struggles and attempts to get Ivan to open up to him. Ivan ignores and is angered by Mr. Wyckoff's attempts until he suggests a writing assignment that interests Ivan. After writing a fantasy story about his future life after high school in San Francisco that shows Ivan's dreams to be of very low aspirations yet nevertheless seem to be desirable to him, he heads to an \\"end of High School\\" party. At the party he is bored with his friends and heads off and finds Nina. Nina jokingly tells him that after high school she wants to rob banks and live in mansions and wants him to go with her. Ivan sees this as an opportunity and tries to kiss Nina. Nina rejects Ivan's advances as they are just friends and they argue about it. After Nina goes back to the party Ivan returns elsewhere in the party and to add to his anguish over the fight with Nina he walks in on a group of boys watching two people have sex in one of the bedrooms. Ivan is further disturbed when, in another room, he sees someone passed out in their own vomit. Ivan angrily heads downstairs looking for alcohol and after taking a beer another teen accuses him of stealing it and then punches Ivan. Ivan, after a terrible night, leaves and runs home where he grabs his step-father's hunting rifle and drives back to the party intent on shooting the place up. However, when he arrives the only people left are a few passed out kids and he can find no one to release his anger upon. He heads home and enter's his parents room where they are sleeping intent on killing his step-father but nerves don't allow him to do so. The film ends with Ivan standing on the Golden Gate Bridge looking out and leaving his father's jacket on the bridge.

Specifically, given a scheme X, the relative Spec :C = \\\\operatorname{Spec}_X R of a quasi-coherent graded OX-algebra R is called the cone or affine cone of R. Similarly, the relative Proj :\\\\mathbb{P}(C) = \\\\operatorname{Proj}_X R is called the projective cone of C or R. Note: The cone comes with the \\\\mathbb{G}_m-action due to the grading of R; this action is a part of the data of a cone (whence the terminology).  Examples  *If X = Spec k is a point and R is a homogeneous coordinate ring, then the affine cone of R is the (usual) affine cone over the projective variety corresponding to R. *If R = \\\\bigoplus_0^\\\\infty I^n/I^{n+1} for some ideal sheaf I, then \\\\operatorname{Spec}_X R is the normal cone to the closed scheme determined by I. *If R = \\\\bigoplus_0^\\\\infty L^{\\\\otimes n} for some line bundle L, then \\\\operatorname{Spec}_X R is the total space of the dual of L. *More generally, given a vector bundle (finite-rank locally free sheaf) E on X, if R=Sym(E*) is the symmetric algebra generated by the dual of E, then the cone \\\\operatorname{Spec}_X R is the total space of E, often written just as E, and the projective cone \\\\operatorname{Proj}_X R is the projective bundle of E, which is written as \\\\mathbb{P}(E). *Let \\\\mathcal{F} be a coherent sheaf on a Deligne‚ÄìMumford stack X. Then let C(\\\\mathcal{F}) := \\\\operatorname{Spec}_X(\\\\operatorname{Sym}(\\\\mathcal{F})). For any f: T \\\\to X, since global Spec is a right adjoint to the direct image functor, we have: C(\\\\mathcal{F})(T) = \\\\operatorname{Hom}_{\\\\mathcal{O}_X}(\\\\operatorname{Sym}(\\\\mathcal{F}), f_* \\\\mathcal{O}_T); in particular, C(\\\\mathcal{F}) is a commutative group scheme over X. *Let R be a graded \\\\mathcal{O}_X-algebra such that R_0 = \\\\mathcal{O}_X and R_1 is coherent and locally generates R as R_0-algebra. Then there is a closed immersion ::\\\\operatorname{Spec}_X R \\\\hookrightarrow C(R_1) :given by \\\\operatorname{Sym}(R_1) \\\\to R. Because of this, C(R_1) is called the abelian hull of the cone \\\\operatorname{Spec}_X R. For example, if R = \\\\oplus_0^{\\\\infty} I^n/I^{n+1} for some ideal sheaf I, then this embedding is the embedding of the normal cone into the normal bundle. = Computations = Consider the complete intersection ideal (f,g_1,g_2,g_3) \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{C}[x_0,\\\\ldots,x_n] and let X be the projective scheme defined by the ideal sheaf \\\\mathcal{I} = (f)(g_1,g_2,g_3). Then, we have the isomorphism of \\\\mathcal{O}_{\\\\mathbb{P}^n}-algebras is given by : \\\\bigoplus_{n\\\\geq 0 } \\\\frac{\\\\mathcal{I}^n}{\\\\mathcal{I}^{n+1}} \\\\cong \\\\frac{\\\\mathcal{O}_X[a,b,c]}{(g_2a - g_1b, g_3a - g_1c, g_3b - g_2c)}  Properties  If S \\\\to R is a graded homomorphism of graded OX-algebras, then one gets an induced morphism between the cones: :C_R = \\\\operatorname{Spec}_X R \\\\to C_S = \\\\operatorname{Spec}_X S. If the homomorphism is surjective, then one gets closed immersions C_R \\\\hookrightarrow C_S,\\\\, \\\\mathbb{P}(C_R) \\\\hookrightarrow \\\\mathbb{P}(C_S). In particular, assuming R0 = OX, the construction applies to the projection R = R_0 \\\\oplus R_1 \\\\oplus \\\\cdots \\\\to R_0 (which is an augmentation map) and gives :\\\\sigma: X \\\\hookrightarrow C_R. It is a section; i.e., X \\\\overset{\\\\sigma}\\\\to C_R \\\\to X is the identity and is called the zero-section embedding. Consider the graded algebra R[t] with variable t having degree one: explicitly, the n-th degree piece is :R_n \\\\oplus R_{n-1} t \\\\oplus R_{n-2} t^2 \\\\oplus \\\\cdots \\\\oplus R_0 t^n. Then the affine cone of it is denoted by C_{R[t]} = C_R \\\\oplus 1. The projective cone \\\\mathbb{P}(C_R \\\\oplus 1) is called the projective completion of CR. Indeed, the zero-locus t = 0 is exactly \\\\mathbb{P}(C_R) and the complement is the open subscheme CR. The locus t = 0 is called the hyperplane at infinity.  O(1)  Let R be a quasi-coherent graded OX-algebra such that R0 = OX and R is locally generated as OX-algebra by R1. Then, by definition, the projective cone of R is: :\\\\mathbb{P}(C) = \\\\operatorname{Proj}_X R = \\\\varinjlim \\\\operatorname{Proj}(R(U)) where the colimit runs over open affine subsets U of X. By assumption R(U) has finitely many degree-one generators xi's. Thus, :\\\\operatorname{Proj}(R(U)) \\\\hookrightarrow \\\\mathbb{P}^r \\\\times U. Then \\\\operatorname{Proj}(R(U)) has the line bundle O(1) given by the hyperplane bundle \\\\mathcal{O}_{\\\\mathbb{P}^r}(1) of \\\\mathbb{P}^r; gluing such local O(1)'s, which agree locally, gives the line bundle O(1) on \\\\mathbb{P}(C). For any integer n, one also writes O(n) for the n-th tensor power of O(1). If the cone C=SpecXR is the total space of a vector bundle E, then O(-1) is the tautological line bundle on the projective bundle P(E). Remark: When the (local) generators of R have degree other than one, the construction of O(1) still goes through but with a weighted projective space in place of a projective space; so the resulting O(1) is not necessarily a line bundle. In the language of divisor, this O(1) corresponds to a Q-Cartier divisor.

Studying at both the University of Manitoba and York University in Toronto, Barrett received his undergraduate B.A. in 1983. Working toward his graduate degree at the University of Denver, he received his master's degree in 1986. Moving forward with his education, Lindon began work at the University of Pennsylvania in order to achieve his Ph.D., which he was awarded in 1990. That year, he started his first academic job, at the University of California-Irvine. By the year 2001, he rose from his assistant position to full professor at Irvine. He remained at Irvine for 17 years until 2007, when he joined the faculty at the University of California-Riverside.  Academic career  He became one of the founding members of the African American Studies program at UCI, where he served as director from 2003 until 2007. He taught an array of subjects at UCI, including literary culture and theory, gender and sexuality, African American literature and pop culture.

Life Yechiel Granatstein was born in Lublin, Poland on June 6, 1913. Even before World War II, he had developed his skills as a writer, writing for Dos Yiddish Tagblat and various Agudah periodicals. While still young and single, he was drafted into the Polish army for military training. He lived in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ from 1936 to 1939. Following the Nazi-Soviet invasion of Poland at the outbreak of World War II he escaped from the Germans to Slonim, which was on the Russian side of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop line, eventually entrapped in the S≈Çonim Ghetto after Operation Barbarossa. In 1942 he escaped to the nearby forests and joined the partisans who were fighting the Nazis. He was accepted into the partisan unit because of his earlier training as a soldier and because he possessed an automatic machine gun. After the war he returned to ≈Å√≥d≈∫ where he assisted refugees in leaving Europe from his base at 66 Wschodnia Street and then continued his refugee rescue work in Paris from 1946 to 1950. It was in Paris in 1950 that he published an autobiography of his time fighting as a Jewish partisan under the title \\"I Wanted to Live\\" (\\"Ich hob gevolt lebn\\" in Yiddish), which detailed the dangers he faced not just from the German Nazis, but from his fellow Russian partisans as well. This book was translated into Hebrew and into English under the title \\"The War of a Jewish Partisan\\". He immigrated to Israel in the 1950s where he continued to write about pre-war Europe and the Holocaust. In Israel he wrote for \\"Shearim\\", \\"Hamodia\\", \\"HaTzofe\\" and other newspapers and journals. He also wrote a biography about his father-in-law's, the Radoschitzer Rebbe's, experiences in the ghettos and concentration camps. He died on February 7, 2008 in Israel.

The site is sometimes called the \\"chemical Chernobyl\\", due to the two million tons of chemical waste accumulated there. The site The Krasny Bor landfill is located about 30 km to the southeast of Saint Petersburg. The site, spanning 73 hectares (180 acres), was brought into use in 1970. Two million tons of waste in Krasnyi Bor are stored in pools, many of which have no cover. The area is surrounded with barbed wire, but outside the fencing there is a channel, into which rain water and waste collects. With the rain and meltwater, poisons from the uncovered pools flow into this channel. The facility is formally under the authority of St. Petersburg. Next to the dumping site there are two rivers, the Izhora River and the Tosna River, which empty into the Neva River. Environmental concerns The site has been characterized as an ecological time bomb. The Baltic Marine Environment Protection Commission (HELCOM) has called it as a particularly polluted area, which will present a serious threat to the Baltic Sea. If waters from the Krasnyi Bor pools should escape, or if the dykes should break, the hazardous waste will end up in the Gulf of Finland. In early March 2016, such a dyke did break, but the leak was detected and blocked up quickly. The machinery of the facility is old, it is inefficient, and according to former head of the facility Kolyakov, if functions only when the temperature is not freezing. In addition to this, problems are caused by the fact that the wasted has been dumped into the pools without any kind of separation of the waste materials. In the spring of 2016, Helsingin Sanomat reported that the Krasnyi Bor dumping site was in a critical state, as the pools containing industrial waste were almost full. The situation is dangerous for the city of St. Petersburg, too, since it takes it water supply from the Neva, below the place where the Izhora River empties into it. In March 2016, Helsingin Sanomat took samples of the water near the dumping ground. The following substances were found in a ditch near it: PCB compounds, cadmium, heavy metals, cyanide, arsenic, as well as the pesticide HCH, signs of solvents and pesticides such as the herbicide MCPA. It has also been claimed that the dumping site contains radioactive waste. The authorities of St. Petersburg claim that all this is false and without basis. The head of the harmful waste from the Finnish Environment Institute SYKE, Jaakko Mannio says that the fact that hazardous substances were found outside the dumping site is an indication of a leak. The problems of the dumping site were publicized by the former director Viktor Kolyakov, who was dismissed five months after the revelations. After this, the city of St. Petersburg has threatened to have him prosecuted for ‚Äúspreading unfounded information.‚Äù The Russian State Prosecutor office has investigated the functioning of the dumping site in 2016. Kolyakov's predecessor is suspected of having exceeded his authority. Connected to the dumping site, there are also cases pending concerning stealing funds from budget of the city of St. Petersburg. In 2015, the city of St. Petersburg wanted to build an incinerator, which would have been designed by a Russian daughter company of the Finnish consulting and engineering company P√∂yry. However, the residents and politicians of the Leningrad Oblast were opposed to the idea of waste being incinerated there, and the plan came to naught. The city has no alternative plan of how to process the waste.

Description  Pinnoctopus cordiformis is identifiable by their orange-brown or purple-grey colouration; iridescent white spots are also found on the arms and web. No white spots can be seen on the mantle.Anderson TJ 1994. Taxonomy and ecology of shallow benthic octopuses in north-eastern New Zealand. MSc thesis. Auckland, New Zealand, University of Auckland. Pinnoctopus has been seen to reach sizes of over 1m in length and 9 kilograms in weight, however these are seldom seen due to residing in deeper waters. Pinnoctopus cordiformis is closest related to Octopus huttoni however the two can be easily distinguished by comparing a range of features; Octopus huttoni is about the size of a fist when fully mature, so is considerably smaller than the Pinnoctopus; Octopus huttoni has a single row of suckers which run up each tentacle, as opposed to Pinnoctopus which has two rows of opposite suckers.Sweeney MJ, Roper CFE, Mangold KM, Clarke MR, Boletzky Sv 1992.

Oceanography and Marine Biology: an annual review 46: 105‚Äì202. Octopus species have no bone structure which allows easy escape from confined spaces, they also have an ability to avoid towed nets which makes them problematic to study and research.Jackson GD, Meekan MG, Wotherspoon S, Jackson CH 2008. Distributions of young cephalopods in the tropical waters of Western Australia over two consecutive summers. ICES Journal of Marine Science 65: 140‚Äì147. Pinnoctopus cordiformis has a globe- shaped head, this contains the brain and other vital organs, it also has a mouth and sharp beak which is used for killing prey. The skin of the octopus is smooth and can change colour slightly to hide from both predators and prey. As a form of self-defence the octopus has an ink-like substance which can be released to deter a predator in order to escape. The eyes of an octopus are considered to be far more developed than those of many other marine species, they are primarily nocturnal and undertake a range of techniques to both escape predators and find prey.  Distribution  = Natural global range = Pinnoctopus cordiformis is primarily found in New Zealand, however they have also been recorded to have been recognized off the coast of South Australia.O'Shea S 1999. The marine fauna of New Zealand: Octopoda (Mollusca: Cephalopoda). NIWA Biodiversity Memoir 112, 280 pp.O'Shea S, Jackson GD 2010. Class Cephalopoda. In: Cook S de C ed. New Zealand Coastal Marine Invertebrates, volume 1. Christchurch, Canterbury University Press. Pp. 541‚Äì559, 565, 566. = New Zealand range = Pinnoctopus cordiformis in shallow rock pool on the coast near Wellington Pinnoctopus cordiformis is known as a reef octopus, they have been found around New Zealand in the locations of: Stewart Island (47ÀöS) to south of Leigh (36ÀöS); they have also been found in the Chatham Islands (35ÀöS to 48ÀöS). = Habitat preferences = Pinnoctopus has been found in waters as deep as 300m, however it can be found it shallow waters close to coastlines. They are commonly found on the sea floor and occasionally in shallow tidal rock pools. As it grows it ventures into subtidal reefs, here they are among the largest predators feeding off crayfish, crabs, and shell fish. Seagrass and seaweed beds are also common habitats for the Pinnoctopus cordiformis.  Life cycle/phenology  The life cycle of Pinnoctopus cordifomis is relatively short. Once they reach full size, they find a mate. The male dies after the mating process; females brood their eggs in a den for approximately 80 days. She does not feed for the duration or leave the den. A short time before the eggs hatch, the female ventures out and dies a short distance away from the den. Pinnoctopus cordiformis can have 56,000‚Äì232,000 eggs; other octopuses such as Thaumeledone zeiss, a rare deep sea octopus only has tens of eggs. Octopods have two different strategies in terms of spawning, the female can either hatch few large eggs which are well developed hatchlings and adopt the benthic promptly. The females can also spawn large quantities of small eggs, these turn into 'planktonic free-swimming paralarvae', these have small suckers, few chromatophores and a translucent musculature.Boyle P, Rodhouse P 2005. Cephalopods: Ecology and Fisheries. 1st edition. Oxford, Blackwell Publishing The eggs of Pinnoctopus cordifomis are of intermediate size (6.43 ¬± 0.21 mm L; 1.45 ¬± 0.11 mm W; 6.41 ¬± 0.52 mg TW) the yolk can be seen through the wall of the egg and represents approximately 57% of the eggs size, they are pear shaped. Once the eggs are hatched paralarvae are released which survive without intervention for the duration of their life cycle. The lifespan of Pinnoctopus cordiformis has been seldom studied; however it is predicted to be between 12‚Äì24 months, depending on mating time.  Diet and foraging  Pinnoctopus cordiformis leaps on any potential prey, wraps its tentacles around it and paralises it with salivary toxin, the octopus then used its 'parrot-like' beak to break up and digest the prey. They generally wait by the entrances of caves or crevasses for unsuspecting fish, crustaceons, molluscs, other octopuses and other edible invertebrates.Grubert MA, Wadley VA 2000. Sexual maturity and fecundity of Octopus maorum in southeast Tasmania. Bulletin of Marine Science 66: 133‚Äì142. Pinnoctopus cordiformis has the ability to break open shellfish with its beak or by pulling it apart to eat the fish inside. Rock lobster and blue cod are two of the primary prey options for Pinnoctopus cordiformis, they get into fishing pots and devour the catch before the fisherman gets a chance. In spring 1970 the Hokianga mean morality rate for blue cod and rock lobster increased to 35%.  Predators, parasites, and diseases  Pinncotopus cordiformis has a large number of predators which are largely the reason for the relatively small and dispersed population. New Zealand sea lions, Buller's albatross, sharks and whales all prey on Pinnoctopus.  Cultural uses  A Maori legend states that the Polynesian navigator Kupe followed a giant octopus known as Te Wheke-o-Muturangi. This octopus was eating all the fish needed for the tribe. Kupe eventually tracked it down in the Cook Strait and killed it by tricking it into holding some water containers while he struck it on the head. Early Maori used to catch octopus by hand. One hand would act as bait whilst the other was used to pick it up and kill it.Maggy Wassilieff and Steve O'Shea. 'Octopus and squid - Octopus in New Zealand', Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand, updated 13-Jul-12 URL: http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/en/octopus-and-squid/page-4 Taxonomy Pinnoctopus cordiformis has been regarded as a synonym of Octopus maorum and there is no existing type specimen of P. cordiformis. There do appear to be consistent differences between specimens identified as P. cordiformis and those identified as O. maorum which suggests that there is a second species but this species more closely resembles a species of the genus Enteroctopus, with the description closely resembling Enteroctopus zealandicus.

Originally formed in March 1918 for service during World War I as part of the all volunteer Australian Imperial Force, it was one of five such units raised as part of the AIF during the war. The battalion consisted of four machine gun companies, which had previously existed as independent companies assigned mainly at brigade level. The battalion took part in the final stages of the war, seeing action during the Allied defensive operations during the German Spring Offensive and then the Allied Hundred Days Offensive, which finally brought an end to the war. The battalion was disbanded in mid-1919 during the demobilisation of the AIF following the conclusion of hostilities. History Originally formed in March 1918 for service during World War I as part of the all volunteer Australian Imperial Force, the 4th Machine Gun Battalion was one of five such units raised as part of the AIF during the war. Formed from Australian Machine Gun Corps personnel, the battalion was assigned to the 4th Division, and had an authorised strength of 46 officers and 890 other ranks. It consisted of four machine gun companies ‚Äì the 4th, 12th, 13th and 24th ‚Äì which had previously existed as independent companies mainly assigned at brigade level. While independent, these companies had been regionally affiliated with Queensland from where their recruits were drawn; however, with the establishment of the battalion identity, this affiliation was discontinued and the battalion became an \\"all states\\" unit. The establishment of machine gun battalions within the AIF was the final step in the evolution of the organisation of direct fire support during the war. At the start of the war, Maxim machine guns had been assigned within line infantry battalions on a limited scale of two per battalion. As it was realised that there was a need for increased fire support, this was later increased to four guns per battalion, operated by a section of one officer and 32 other ranks. At the end of the Gallipoli Campaign, the AIF was reorganised and expanded in preparation for its transfer to the Western Front, and the machine gun sections within each infantry battalion had been consolidated into companies assigned at brigade level. The battalion's commanding officer on formation was Lieutenant Colonel Harry Murray, who had previously received the Victoria Cross for his actions while serving with the 13th Infantry Battalion. Murray commanded the battalion until the end of the war. The first three of battalion's constituent companies had been formed in Egypt in February 1916 during a period when the AIF was being expanded in preparation for its transfer to the Western Front following the end of the disastrous Gallipoli Campaign. At that time they had been assigned to the 4th, 12th and 13th Brigades respectively (the company designations corresponded with the brigade designations), arriving in Europe in mid-1916. These companies had participated in the fighting around Pozieres and Mouquet Farm in 1916, before taking part in the Battle of Bullecourt in early 1917 as the Germans withdrew to the Hindenburg Line. They had subsequently taken part in the fighting around Messines and Ypres in the latter half of 1917. The 24th Machine Gun Company, however, had been formed in England in February 1917. The company was briefly re-designated as the 17th Machine Gun Company in June 1917 as part of plans to raise the 17th Brigade, but returned to its original designation in August 1917 when the 17th Brigade was disbanded without having seen combat due to manpower shortages. When the decision was made to assign an extra company at divisional level so that each division had four companies (one for each brigade and one as a divisional asset), the company was assigned to the 4th Division, arriving in France in 1917. The battalion's unit colour patch (UCP) was a black and gold circle, which was usually worn above the crossed guns badge of the Machine Gun Corps. While the battalion's constituent companies had previously been issued distinctive UCPs, upon the formation of the battalion these were replaced by the single battalion style. The black and gold colours were chosen to signify that the unit as a machine gun unit, while the circle showed that the 4th Machine Gun Battalion was part of the 4th Division, which used the same shape UCP for the majority of its units. The battalion was equipped with a total of 64 Vickers medium machine guns ‚Äì assigned at a scale of 16 per company ‚Äì and took part in the final stages of the war, seeing action during the Allied defensive operations during the German Spring Offensive and then the Allied Hundred Days Offensive, which finally brought an end to the war. During these battles, the battalion was employed to provide enfilade fire in defence, and plunging fire in support of attacking infantry forces, engaging targets out to . Due to the exposed position from which the machine gunners fired, they suffered heavy casualties. Following the conclusion of hostilities, the battalion was disbanded in mid-1919 during the demobilisation of the AIF. One member of the 4th Machine Gun Company, Sergeant (later Lieutenant) John Dwyer, received the Victoria Cross for his actions during the war, prior to the company's incorporation into the 4th Machine Gun Battalion. Legacy After the war, the machine gun battalion concept was discontinued in the Australian Army and in the 1920s medium machine gun platoons were added to standard infantry battalions. However, the machine gun battalion was revived again in 1937 as fears of war in Europe surfaced again, and four Australian Light Horse regiments ‚Äì the 1st, 16th, 17th and 18th ‚Äì were converted into machine gun regiments. Following the outbreak of World War II, four machine gun battalions were eventually raised as part of the Second Australian Imperial Force, each assigned at divisional level. Several more units were raised within the Militia including the 6th and 7th Machine Gun Battalions, both of which served in New Guinea, while several more light horse regiments were also converted for home defence including the 14th, 19th, 25th and 26th. The 5th Machine Gun Battalion was also re-raised and undertook garrison duties as part of Torres Strait Force. At the end of that war, though, the decision was made to return machine guns to the establishment of individual infantry battalions and consequently since then no further machine gun battalions have been raised as part of the Australian Army. According to Alexander Rodger, as a result of the decision not to re- raise machine gun battalions in the early interwar years, no battle honours were subsequently awarded to the 4th Machine Gun Battalion - or any other First World War machine gun battalion - as there was no equivalent unit to perpetuate the honours when they were promulgated by the Australian Army in 1927.

Description \\"Like all arthropods, Platypus aplicalis is an invertebrate with an external skeleton, segmented body and jointed appendages. The colour of Platypus apicalis is mainly dark-brown, with yellow basal joint of antennae, metathorax and femora. The body is cylindrical in cross section and greatly elongated from front to rear. It is less than 2 mmm wide and about 5.8 mm long. The mandibles of adults are oriented downward. The terminal segment of the antennae is dorso-ventrally flattened and larger than the other antennal segments. The mesothoracic wings are modified into a hardened wing case. A narrow longitudinal groove is present on the middle of the pronotum. The elytra bear parallel longitudinal grooves, are mainly smooth but pubescent at their rear end and sides, and are sloping downward at their posterior end. Platypus apicalis exhibits sexual dimorphism. The elytrae of males bear tooth like projections at their posterior end. The body of females is more pubescent than this of males, lack elytral teeth, and have a more rounded shape.> Adult males release a strong and distinguishable odor to attract a female upon digging a breeding gallery. Females have not been found to release this scent. Eggs are round, less than 1 mm in diameter, and have a creamy appearance. Young larvae are flat and have fleshy projections on sides. In contrast, fully grown larvae are white, cylindrical and legless with yellow coloured heads. At this stage the mandibles begin to orient downward and ridges start to appear on the top of the prothorax.  Distribution  = Natural range = Platypus apicalis only occurs in New Zealand. More specifically, it occurs on the West coast of the South Island and the centre of the North Island in natural beech wood forests and in certain exotic plantations, such as these of eucalyptus. = Habitat preferences = The habitat preference of this species is predominantly dead beech wood forest, including Red Beech, Silver Beech and Black beech. Platypus apicalis appear in dead tissues surrounding trees and larvae. Few fungi are related to pinhole borer closely, they benefit beetles in different ways. Ambrosia fungi provide food that they depend on. Pathogenic fungi which can infect or even kill live tree is carried by insects.[Stephen D. R., Celine H., Tracey L.N., Michael B., Travis R.G. (2007). Forest Ecology and Management. Persistence of conidia and potential efficacy of Beauveria bassiana against pinhole borers in New Zealand southern beech forests. 246(2-3), 232-239. doi:10.1016/j.foreco.2007.04.005] The beetle has no preference for hard or soft wood as it resides inside the Beech trees and some Eucalyptus species. Platypus resides in the dead wood of the tree but when numbers grow due to sufficient breeding material, healthy trees are threatened by their invasion. They are considered pests at times to native forests but only when they threaten healthy trees. Their main pest area is the forestry plantations where they colonise and render some high quality timber useless due to imperfections and colour change in the timber. Their nests are more likely to kill the part of living tree. The beetles occur commonly along the North Island, South Island and Chatham Island, however, has not spotted in some eastern forests such as Balmoral and Eyrewell State forests, Canterbury = Economic significance = Platypus apicalis can be a pest in high quality timber plantations. It vectors fungi that develop into the wood, altering its color. In addition, their tunnels, which go deep into the wood, create imperfections in the finished timber, which also weakens it. Life cycle/Phenology The life cycle begins with a male adult boring a tunnel into a host tree and releasing fungal spores along the way. Fungal species, particularly ambrosia fungi, serve as the primary food for the beetle, which gives the name of the nickname to the beetle, \\"Ambrosia Beetles\\". This tunneling process usually occurs within the early summer months of November and December. Once the tunnel is several centimetres long, the insect will release an odour that acts as an attractant to female insects. If enough male beetles do this at once, it leads to so called \\"mass attacks\\" on trees where swarms of beetles attack a single host specimen. However, not like the other bark beetles that they rely on the inner tunnel, adults and larvae both will soon acquire the primary food. During the feeding stage, yeasts are likewise transmitted by bark beetles, but their precise role has not been discovered yet.[Milligan R.h. (1974). Proceedings of the New Zealand ecological society. Insects damaging beech (nothofagus) forests. 21, 32-40.] Copulation occurs at the tunnel entrance and afterward the female goes into the tunnel and begins the process of making a nest. The male continues to enlarge the tunnel and remove excess frass (excreta). The tunnel is initially radial but eventually has a sharp right angle and moves towards the heartwood of a tree. Meanwhile the female lays the first batch of egg containing four to seven eggs. Following this, another branch of the tunnel is then started by the male and eventually a second egg batch is laid. The pair will feed the larvae until they reach maturity using specialized structures called mycangia, which is located on the head of the adult. At this point 8‚Äì10 months have passed since copulation. While the exact time of larval hatching is not yet certain, it is known that there is a period of two years from the time the nest is laid to the time that fully grown beetles emerge from hosts. During this time the larvae go through several stages. Initially the larva simply extend the tunnels of the parents. These extensions differ from the parents in that the tunnels are concave rather than flat. During this time, the larvae grow bigger in size and begin to take on some adult features. After a period of several months, the larva excavate pupal chambers within the tree. The larvae then enter the chambers and become pupas, intermediate insect form. Finally, when two years have passed since the egg laying, adult beetles emerge from the chambers and exit the tree. This occurs during the summer months of January to March. The average number of beetles per tree is 115. The adult beetles then go out into the forest and look for a new host tree. The lifecycle is then repeated. The average lifespan of an adult pinhole beetle is estimated to be 3‚Äì4 years. Diet and foraging Platypus apicalis is classified as an ambrosia wood boring beetle. Beetles in the category survive by boring tunnels into the xylem (water transport tissue) and phloem (food transport tissue) of a host tree species. Ambrosia beetles have a symbiotic relationship with a category of fungus known as Ambrosia. Fungal spores are contained within the gut of Ambrosia beetles and as beetles bore into a tree, they release the spores. The fungus is then cultivated within the tree and used by the beetles as a food sources. The xylem and phloem tissue of the tree is merely a medium for the fungus, it is not a source of food for the beetle. Platypus aplicalis do not feed on the wood they bore, instead they eat the yeast that accumulates on the bored tunnels. This yeast provides a steady diet for both adults and larvae (. Predators, parasites, and diseases Along with the Ambrosia fungi, pathogenic fungi is associated with the fully grown beetles. This fungi has been known to infect and kill the host tree when it is attacked by the adult beetles. Populations of the insect are currently controlled by agricultural cultural practices, there are no effective predators of the insect, there is a species of parasitic nematode known to situate with the insect but its effectiveness in population control is unknown. Scientists have tested strains of B. bassiana, B. brongniartii and Metarhizium anisopliae which are found in southern beech forests or in places where no Platypus are found. They were tested on both the adult and larvae stages of the insect, a total of 10 isolates where tested and scientists found that all killed the adult stage of the insect. This provides a natural and common control method that could be used in the future to help control the population of the Platypus apicali. Other information New Zealand Platypus species Platypus apicalis, Platypus caviceps and Platypus gracilis have an imperative impact in transmitting airborne and water-borne spore to contaminate the injuries, as there would be no effect from atmosphere on organism's developing in many parts of the nation. Spores can be either liberated from mycelium creating on the surface of corrupted trees or other wood surfaces or by wind-borne frass sullied with spores and mycelial parts from frightening little creature tunneling in polluted tissue. There is in like manner the affirmation of underground spread, probably through either root joins root contact or underground vectors. displayed that C. australis was not subject to P. subgranosus for transmission or for entry to the trees, despite the way that P. subgranosus are of critical in ailment spread through opportunity of polluted frass and the making of wounds in concentrated on trees [Ridley G.S., Bain J., Bulman L.S., Dick M.A. & Kay M.K. (2000) Threats to New Zealand‚Äôs indigenous forests from exotic pathogens and pests. Department of Conservation] Economic Impacts Platypus apicalis has both biodiversity and economic impacts. From a biodiversity perspective, the beetles are a threat to beech trees. While some trees have been known to survive, in most cases the combination of the tunnels through the xylem and phloem and the subsequent fungal infection prove lethal. This and the fact that it has no known predators and few parasites makes it a potential threat to beech tree population numbers. There is also the threat of the species escaping New Zealand via exports of lumber. Beech species exist throughout much of the world and it is conceivable that the insect could survive quite well elsewhere. From an economic standpoint, the tree reduces the amount of native timber available. Even if a tree is not killed outright, the invasion often causes defects such as concealed rot pockets and irregular wood cores. Damaged trees are also easy targets for other species of fungi. This not only affects logging companies, but also associated industries. Pheromones The New Zealand Pinhole Borer beetle is technically a wood boring beetle but its pheromones more closely resemble bark beetles because it retains an aggression pheromone, allowing Platypus apicalis to cause large scale mortality to their hosts. This chemical is produced in their hind gut.

Carillons originally included three movements but Williams revised the work in 1973, adding a fourth movement. Composition history Grace Williams composed Carillons in 1965 from a commission by the BBC in Wales, who requested \\"something light-weight and entertaining\\" for the programme Auditorium. By omitting the usual orchestral woodwind section and making use of high-pitched percussion (triangle, glockenspiel, celesta and tubular bells) Williams created a distinctive orchestral colour with bell-like sounds which inspired the title of the work (A carillon is musical instrument including a number of bells usually played with a keyboard, and originally from the French for bells or chimes). Although completed in 1965 the premier was postponed to coincide with the official opening of the BBC's new studios at Llandaff on St David's Day, 1967. The work was premiered by Philip Jones (oboe) with the BBC Welsh Orchestra conducted by Rae Jenkins. Music The work is composed for solo oboe and orchestra and comprises four movements: #Moderato con moto #Allegretto alla pavana #Lento rapsodico #Allegro agitato The third movement was added in 1973 and is in the style of an unaccompanied cadenza which adds to the soloistic display of the piece. The piece is scored for solo oboe, 2 french horns, 2 trumpets, 3 trombones, percussion (including triangle, glockenspiel, celesta and tubular bells), harp, and strings (violins, violas, cellos, and double-bass). Publication Carillons has been published by Curiad, Caernarfon. Recordings Carillons was recorded by Anthony Camden (oboe) with the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by David Atherton in 1974 (HMV ASD3006), and re-issued in 1995 (Lyrita SRCD323). The recording was one of a series of recordings of Williams' works in the 1970s to promote her work, made with the help of the Welsh Arts Council.

It recognises the importance of race, culture, beliefs, values, attitudes, religion and language in the life of the client. The concept has been developed by Jafar Kareem in his book Intercultural Therapy. Kareem (1992) believed that there are some intrinsic differences between individual human beings, either in their biology, their personality or both, and that both inter- and intrapsychic events profoundly affect an individual's psyche and develop as part of their unconscious life. The events of the external world, then, are real but they are also internalised. Intercultural therapy responds to the cultural variances identified by the field of anthropology. An intercultural therapist must take the external realities of a client's life into account, such as poverty, refugee status, racism, sexism, physical health and physical abilities. Kareem believed that failure to understand cultural issues may lead to major diagnostic and therapeutic errors. Intercultural therapy recognises the differences and similarities of various aspects of culture for both the client and therapist, and that the very fact of being from another culture involves both conscious and unconscious assumptions, both in the patient and in the therapist. These unconscious assumptions sometimes mean traditional modes of therapy do not address the needs of someone from outside a dominant culture, or that therapy is not offered to them in the first place.

It is a natural region in the Habichtswald Highlands in the counties of Kassel and Schwalm-Eder-Kreis in North Hesse. The actual Langenberg itself is the hill chain that runs from the Saukopf south-southeast via the Schwengeberg, Laufskopf, Bensberg and Bilstein to the Kammerberg and forms the eastern watershed of the Eder tributary, the Ems at Bauna and the stream of Pilgerbach. In the eponymous natural region this crest line is flanked by woodland to the west and east, and in the southeast by the adjacent higher ground west of the Kassel Basin.

It involves the contracting of the operations and responsibilities of transportation, cooking, customer servicing or settlement of accounts business processes to a third-party service provider. Such provider bears the ultimate responsibility for the proper execution of the designated functions at stores, warehouses or catering facilities. The service supplier carries out the internal (back office) and front office duties including recruiting, training and legalizing human resources, tracking their job conduct, reporting and solving the problems, performing daily production tasks. Retail outsourcing is typically contracted for operational segments requiring large amounts of unskilled work force in such spheres as shipment, cash desk processing, counter servicing, bread baking, meat and fish cutting, cleaning, dish washing, packing, boxing or bundling. Initially, the concept of retail outsourcing has been conceived in Russia. It has fully matured by the end of the 2000s. Currently, retail outsourcing is practiced by all major Russian retailers. It accounts for more than 25% of their total business operations. Even the abolition of the contingent labor (2016) failed to impact these services significantly. It only put a ban on specific segments (primarily, cash desk processing) but left other parts almost intact.

Originally formed in March 1918 for service during World War I as part of the all volunteer Australian Imperial Force, it was one of five such units raised as part of the AIF during the war. The battalion consisted of four machine gun companies, which had previously existed as independent companies assigned mainly at brigade level. The battalion took part in the final stages of the war, seeing action during the Allied defensive operations during the German Spring Offensive and then the Allied Hundred Days Offensive, which finally brought an end to the war. The battalion was disbanded in mid-1919 during the demobilisation of the AIF following the conclusion of hostilities. History Originally formed in March 1918 for service during World War I as part of the all volunteer Australian Imperial Force, the 3rd Machine Gun Battalion was one of five such units raised as part of the AIF during the war. Assigned to the 3rd Division, and consisting of personnel from the Australian Machine Gun Corps, the battalion had an authorised strength of 46 officers and 890 other ranks, and it consisted of four machine gun companies ‚Äì the 9th, 10th, 11th and 23rd ‚Äì which had previously existed as independent companies mainly assigned at brigade level. While independent, these companies had been regionally affiliated with various states within Australia from where their recruits were drawn; however, with the establishment of the battalion identity, this affiliation was discontinued and the battalion became an \\"all states\\" unit. The establishment of machine gun battalions within the AIF was the final step in the evolution of the organisation of direct fire support during the war. At the start of the war, Maxim machine guns had been assigned within line infantry battalions on a limited scale of two per battalion. As it was realised that there was a need for increased fire support, this was later increased to four guns per battalion, operated by a section of one officer and 32 other ranks. At the end of the Gallipoli Campaign, the AIF was reorganised and expanded in preparation for its transfer to the Western Front, and the machine gun sections within each infantry battalion had been consolidated into companies assigned at brigade level. The battalion's commanding officer on formation was Lieutenant Colonel Archibald Blacklow, who had previously served in both the 35th and 36th Infantry Battalions. The first three of battalion's constituent companies had been formed in Australia ‚Äì in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland ‚Äì in February 1916 during a period when the AIF was being expanded in preparation for its transfer to the Western Front following the end of the disastrous Gallipoli Campaign. At that time they had been assigned to the 9th, 10th and 11th Brigades respectively, arriving in the United Kingdom in mid-1916. These companies had undertaken advanced training with the 3rd Division on Salisbury Plain in the United Kingdom as the division was prepared for the rigours of trench warfare, before arriving on the Western Front in late 1916. They had subsequently taken part in the fighting around Messines and Ypres in 1917. The 23rd Machine Gun Company, however, had been formed in England in January 1917. The company was briefly re-designated as the 16th Machine Gun Company as part of plans to raise the 16th Brigade, but returned to its original designation in August 1917 when the 16th Brigade was disbanded without having seen combat due to manpower shortages. When the decision was made to assign an extra company at divisional level so that each division had four companies, the company was assigned to the 3rd Division. The battalion's unit colour patch (UCP) was a black and gold oval, which was usually worn above the crossed guns badge of the Machine Gun Corps. While the battalion's constituent companies had previously been issued distinctive UCPs, upon the formation of the battalion these were replaced by the single battalion style. The black and gold colours were chosen to signify that the unit as a machine gun unit, while the oval showed that the 3rd Machine Gun Battalion was part of the 3rd Division, which used the same shape UCP for the majority of its units. The battalion was equipped with a total of 64 Vickers medium machine guns ‚Äì assigned at a scale of 16 per company ‚Äì and took part in the final stages of the war, seeing action during the Allied defensive operations during the German Spring Offensive and then the Allied Hundred Days Offensive, which finally brought an end to the war. During these battles, the battalion was employed to provide enfilade fire in defence, and plunging fire in support of attacking infantry forces, engaging targets out to . Due to the exposed position from which the machine gunners fired, they suffered heavy casualties. Following the conclusion of hostilities, the battalion was disbanded in mid-1919 during the demobilisation of the AIF. The battalion was disbanded in mid-1919 during the demobilisation of the AIF following the conclusion of hostilities. Legacy After the war, the machine gun battalion concept was discontinued in the Australian Army and in the 1920s medium machine gun platoons were added to the organization of standard infantry battalions. However, the machine gun battalion was revived again in 1937 as fears of war in Europe surfaced again, and four Australian Light Horse regiments ‚Äì the 1st, 16th, 17th and 18th ‚Äì were converted into machine gun regiments. Following the outbreak of World War II, four machine gun battalions were eventually raised as part of the Second Australian Imperial Force, each assigned at divisional level. Several more units were raised within the Militia including the 6th and 7th Machine Gun Battalions, which served in New Guinea, while several more light horse regiments were also converted for home defence, including the 14th, 19th, 25th and 26th. The 5th Machine Gun Battalion was also re-raised and undertook garrison duties as part of Torres Strait Force. At the end of that war, though, the decision was made to return machine guns to the establishment of individual infantry battalions and consequently since then no further machine gun battalions have been raised as part of the Australian Army. According to Alexander Rodger, as a result of the decision not to re-raise machine gun battalions in the early interwar years, no battle honours were subsequently awarded to the 3rd Machine Gun Battalion - or any other First World War machine gun battalion - as there was no equivalent unit to perpetuate the honours when they were promulgated by the Australian Army in 1927.

The filmmakers were inspired to make the movie after learning of the existence of a small portion of Yellowstone National Park that, under the Sixth Amendment's Vicinage Clause, could enable one to commit a crime without having a jury be able to try them, thus creating \\"the perfect crime\\". This idea was first written about in a Georgetown Law Journal article, \\"The Perfect Crime,\\" by Michigan State University law professor Brian C. Kalt.  Synopsis  The film is a \\"mockumentary\\" examining the history of Dwayne Nelson, a suspected murderer. In 2009, Nelson confessed to shooting three men to death in Yellowstone National Park and despite his confession being accurately detailed, he was not convicted of the crimes because the crime occurred in an uninhabited area and as such, there is no chance of finding a jury to hear the trial. Years later Julian T. Pinder examines the crimes and the legal loophole that allowed Nelson to walk free. As the film progresses Pinder begins to receive strange and frightening items, evidence of Nelson's crime.  Reception  In its opening week in Canada, the film grossed C$3841 from 15 theatres. The Hollywood Reporter said that although the film was uneven in places it was also \\"creatively eerie\\". Shock Till You Drop praised the movie, commenting that \\"Knowing that POPULATION ZERO is a hypothetical scenario played out is immaterial. The question of whether the film is real or not is not the point.

When a translation degree was introduced in 1972, it became the √âcole de traduction et d‚Äôinterpr√©tation (School of Translation and Interpreting - ETI), before adopting its current title ‚Äì Faculty of Translation and Interpreting ‚Äì in 2011. Initially a part of the Faculty of Humanities, the EIG broke away from the Faculty between 1953-1955, and eventually became an independent institution of the university. Today, the FTI has over a hundred teachers and researchers.  Location  Up until 1946, the school's administrative offices were located in Antoine Velleman's office at 5 Avenue Marc-Monnier, then in an apartment at 4 Rue Saint-Victor. Three rooms and the hallway were used for the school, while three other rooms were reserved for administrative purposes. From 1952‚Äì1953, the University was renovated and the school's administrative offices were set up on the former premises of the physics institute (ground floor). In 1978, the school moved to the Cours Commerciaux de Gen√®ve building at 19 Place des Augustins. It then moved to the new Uni Mail building at 40 Boulevard du Pont-d'Arve in 1992.  Resources and services  Students have access to IT and audiovisual resources, as well as a library specialized in translation studies, translation (theory, history, education, etc.), consecutive and simultaneous interpreting, sign language interpreting, computational linguistics, terminology and lexicology. = Library = The FTI library is located on the second floor of Uni-Mail. Students can consult and take out books on subjects taught at the FTI, specialized and language dictionaries, and journals. Since 1984, the library has been a part of RERO, a network of libraries in Western Switzerland. It uses the Dewey Decimal System. The first FTI library was made up of Antoine Velleman's own personal collection of works, which he kept in his office on Avenue Marc-Monnier and would lend out to students. In 1953, a room in the basement of the Bastions building on Rue de Candolle was converted into a library. The library truly became specialized, providing access to a collection of dictionaries (monolingual, bilingual, technical) and documents on the International Organizations. When the school moved to the Cours Commerciaux de Gen√®ve building in 1978, the library was equipped with computers, cassette tapes containing interpreting exercises and CD-ROMs. = Simultaneous interpreting = Antoine Velleman was not in favour of simultaneous interpreting and so, initially, only consecutive interpreting classes were offered by the school. Graduates of the programme took it upon themselves to organize simultaneous interpreting training sessions in the evenings. The school's alumni association (AAEDEI) contacted IBM to set up an interpreting booth. The training sessions took place in a room rented on the ground floor of a Methodist church at 12 Rue Calvin. Sessions took place regularly from 1947 onwards. Each participant had to pay three francs per session in order to cover the cost of constructing the booth and renting the room. It was not until 1950 that the first simultaneous interpreting classes were officially offered at the school by Serge Gloor. In 1952, the school acquired simultaneous interpreting equipment, thanks to a donation from IBM. On 4 February 1953, a new simultaneous interpreting training room was inaugurated in the basement of Uni Bastions. The room was equipped with ten booths and a control box, which was integrated into the teacher's desk, allowing the teacher to monitor each booth. Today, the Faculty has a virtual teaching platform that allows simultaneous interpreting to be taught at a distance. The application gives users access to digitized speeches, a forum, a chat system and a space for teachers to give feedback to students. Students can listen back to the original speech as well as their interpretation of it.  FTI Programmes  The Faculty offers the following programmes: Bachelor of Arts in Multilingual Communication, Master of Arts in Translation, Master of Arts in Conference Interpreting,Graduates of the FTI are among the best interpreters in the world, according to an article in The Monocle Forecast, Complementary Certificate in Translation. Students make up their language combination based on the languages offered by the Faculty, which are German, English, Arabic, Spanish, French, Italian and Russian. Besides translation and conference interpreting, the programmes offered by the Faculty can lead to careers in multilingual communication, public relations, the media, public administration, tourism, the court system, language mediation services, education and research.  Exchange programmes  The FTI has exchange agreements with 70 universities in over 20 countries.  Research  In the first few years of its existence, the school was mostly geared towards professional training, but today, it carries out research in a variety of different fields. = Research groups = FTI's research groups are currently leading projects financed by the European Union and the Swiss National Science Foundation. The Centre for Legal and Institutional Translation Studies (Transius) specializes in legal and institutional translation. The \\"Economics, Languages and Education\\" research group (Observatoire √©lf) looks into linguistic diversity management. The Department of Translation Technology (TIM) works with translation technology, speech recognition in language learning, terminology and lexicology. The Interpreting Department carries out projects on interpreting, cognition and humanitarian aspects of interpreting. = PhD Programme = The FTI has a PhD programme with specializations in translation studies, multilingual information processing, conference interpreting, and multilingual communication management.  Local and international relations  = Continuing education = The FTI offers continuing education degree and certificate programmes in translation studies, translation methodology, translation (financial, legal, technical and literary), writing (active and passive languages), technical writing, computer-assisted translation, terminology and interpreting. = European and international networks = The FTI is a member of a number of European and international networks, including: * UN University Outreach Programme; * European Masters in Conference Interpreting (EMCI); * European Masters in Translation (EMT); * Conf√©rence internationale permanente d'instituts universitaires de traducteurs et interpr√®tes (CIUTI); * Universities Contact Group of the International Annual Meeting on Language Arrangements, Documentation and Publications (IAMLADP). = Technological innovation = The FTI collaborates with the city of Geneva on technologically innovative projects. BabelDr, a collaboration between the FTI and Geneva's University Hospitals, won the Innogap prize in 2015.

He was part of the Wales national football team between 1899 and 1905, playing 6 matches. He played his first match on 4 March 1899 against Ireland and his last match on 8 April 1905 against Ireland. Six international appearances in all but only four international caps awarded due to the one cap per season rule. These caps were kept for many years in pristine condition by Georges descendants, before they were stolen in a house burglary in Australia and never recovered. At club level, he played for Druids, Gravesend, Oswestry United, Shrewsbury Town, Druids again, Oswestry United again and finally Acrefair United. He was described a \\"a hard working and thoughtful player. George had a natural talent for ball control and relied on a \\"scientific approach\\", that is, working the ball skilfully out of defence. He played all of his football around the Welsh border country apart from two seasons at a higher level with Gravesend United in the Southern League where he made 24 appearances. In the Oswestry side, George had a good understanding with Tom Parry and the pair were regarded as the brains of the team\\". The Wrexham Advertiser, Saturday March 11, 1899 described George as follows:- \\"Richards (Druids). Right Half. An exceedingly hard working half. Never tires. Is good both in defence and attack. Follows his forwards splendidly and is not above having a try at goal himself. Knows the combination game well and gives his wing every opportunity to get away\\". He played on until his late thirties, closing his career with Acrefair United in the Wrexham and District League. George was later landlord of the Grosvenor Arms Hotel in Cefn Mawr, near Llangollen for many years. George was a Welsh Cup winner on four occasions. He won the Welsh Cup twice with the Druids in the 1897/98 and the 1898/99 seasons. In the first of these finals, they beat Wrexham 2-1 in a replay at the Cricket Field at Oswestry (after a 1-1 draw) and repeated the feat the following year, again against Wrexham, this time winning 1-0 at the Hand Field, Chirk in a replay (after a 2-2 draw). George won the Welsh cup twice more with the Oswestry United team during two spells. In 1900/01 season, they beat his old club Druids 1-0 at the Racecourse Ground, Wrexham to take the trophy and then in his second spell at Oswestry, in 1906/07, they beat Whitchurch by 2-0 at the Racecourse Ground, Wrexham. .

Additionally, this law provides a framework that outlines the provider‚Äôs obligations and rights as they apply to providing their certification services. Description ZertES was approved into law on December 19, 2003. The law promotes the use of secure services for electronic certification to facilitate the use of qualified electronic signatures. Under this law, the signatures would be equal to a handwritten signature. Switzerland‚Äôs ZertES law possesses a similar tiered structure and standards of legal value as the European Union‚Äôs eIDAS Regulation. ZertES provides several assurance levels; qualified electronic signatures is the highest level, equivalent to a handwritten signature. For many official documents, it is required that the electronic signatures used be at this qualified electronic signature level. Standards Under ZertES, an electronic signature refers to electronic data that is either attached to or associated to other electronic data, which serves as a means of authentication for that data. Currently, ZertES does not provide specifications on how electronic signatures should be technically implemented. Despite this limitation, the Swiss Federal Council has made international agreements to facilitate the international use of electronic signatures and allow for their legal recognition. Therefore, the council allows that electronic signatures that have been technically implemented as digital standards in eIDAS be accepted. The following standards are recognized by the Swiss Federal Council: * XAdES * PAdES * CAdES Electronic transactions A , also known as an advanced electronic signature, must meet certain requirements in order to prove its authenticity, including: *Establishing a unique link to its signatory *The ability to identify its signatory or holder *Having been created with software or equipment that remains under the sole control of its signatory *The capability of identifying if the data or document to which it is attached to has been altered or tampered with after being signed ZertES allows for the enhancement of the advanced electronic signature and its legal value by adding on a qualified certificate, which is similar to how eIDAS allows for this instance. The upgraded advanced electronic signature is referred as or qualified electronic signature. The signature must be produced by a secure signature creation device and then be attached to the qualified certificate. At the time that the signature is created, the certification must be valid. ZertES requires that qualified certificates must provide: *A serial number that identifies it as a qualified certificate *The name of the individual who holds the signature verification *Signature verification *The name and state where the issuer of the certificate is established, in addition to the qualified electronic signature of the issuer, referred to as , in addition to the national or foreign accreditation body that accredited the issuer *Time that the certificate will be valid for *Proof of recognition for the certificate service provider who provides the certification services *Transaction information for which the certificate can be used Certificate service providers that issue qualified certificates are required to undergo audits performed by a conformity assessment body that has been appointed by the . Under ZertES, the Swiss Federal Council regulates signature generation and issues (signature verification keys) to qualified certificates. The secure signature creative device must verify that the signature key used is: *Unique and its secrecy can be reasonably assured *Protected from being counterfeited *Under the sole control of the signatory The signature verification process will ensure that: *The data used to verify the signature corresponds to the data sent to the verifier *The signature is reliably verified and its verification result is displayed correctly *If needed, the verifier is able to determine the contents of the signed data *It is clearly identified when a pseudonym is used *If tampering has occurred, it will be detected *The signature owner‚Äôs identity is properly displayed ZertES requires qualified trust service providers to meet requirements that will ensure the validity of the certificates they issue for electronic signatures. Providers can be naturalized or legal citizens. Under certain circumstances, foreign suppliers may be permitted to provide certification services. Legal implications ZertES is similar to eIDAS in assuring the legal bindingness of electronic signatures and a tiered approach to legal value in court with qualified electronic signatures having a higher probative value than advanced electronic signatures. Cross-border communications between Switzerland and the Member state of the European Union occur on a daily basis, as the country is home to many internationally active banks and companies. Therefore, ZertES and eiDAS are comparable in technical design and carry similar legal implications.

In 1967, The Philadelphia Inquirer praised Vald√©s-Blain as an \\"excellent guitarist ‚Ä¶expressive beyond expectation\\" and a musician who \\"... meshed solo lines precisely and impassively spiced them with virtuoso playing that included even, clear trills. The orchestra dropped to a whisper to accommodate the soloist who developed the solo line firmly, even passionately.\\" The Philadelphia Bulletin wrote that he was a \\"Nimble soloist (who) ... restored the guitar to its place as an instrument of delicacy and clarity.\\"  Legacy  Throughout his life- time, Vald√©s-Blain and his wife Joan maintained a close friendship with Carmen Amaya, who is arguably considered to be one of the greatest flamenco dancers of all time. In 2002, they were interviewed in the documentary Carmen Amaya: Queen of The Gypsies, about Amaya's life and art. Vald√©s-Blain had provided guitar accompaniment on her American tour and a close friendship united them. His brother, Alberto died in Spain in 2002. For his \\"many contributions to the art of the classic guitar\\" the New York Society of The Classic Guitar presented Vald√©s-Blain with a Fellowship. Rolando was also an inventor who developed several innovations for the classical guitar. He held patents for a music stand and his Muffletone, a sound mute which allows for quiet practice in hotel rooms, for example. Articles have appeared \\"in recognition of distinguished musicianship and for many important contributions to the art of the guitar\\", stating that Vald√©s-Blain has left a rich legacy to the world of the classical guitar.

It is dedicated to Henry William Paget (the first Marquess of Anglesey) to commemorate his valour in the Napoleonic Wars. The column is a Grade II* listed building. The monument (designed by Thomas Harrison) was erected close to Paget's country retreat at Plas Newydd, in 1817. On the foundation stone there is an inscription, which also reads in Welsh and Latin; > The inhabitants of the counties of Anglesey and Caernarvon have erected this > column in grateful commemoration of the distinguished military achievements > of their countryman HENRY WILLIAM, MARQUESS OF ANGLESEY the leader of the > British Cavalry in Spain throughout the arduous Campaign of 1807 and Second > in Command of the Armies confederated against France at the memorable battle > of Waterloo on the 18th of June 1815. Thomas Harrison Architect. During the battle of Waterloo, Paget (at that time Lord Uxbridge) lost his leg to a cannonball hit. It is claimed he turned to Lord Wellington when his leg was hit, and exclaimed, \\"By God, sir, I've lost my leg!\\" ‚Äî to which Wellington replied, \\"By God, sir, so you have!\\". Paget was later fitted with the first ever articulated wooden leg. The column stands on an outcrop of blueschist rock, formed when pillow lavas have been metamorphosed under high pressure but relatively low temperature. This example is amongst the oldest known in the world, and in 2010 the site was declared a Geological Site of Special Scientific Interest.  Statue  The monument was not completed until 1860 (after the Marquess had died) when the brass sculpture at the top was added. Matthew Noble sculpted the statue.  Present Condition  In recent years, the condition of the column has deteriorated. Many of the wooden steps in the tower have rotted, and pose a severe fire risk.

SDIP brings together public and private entities‚Äîfrom both developed and developing countries‚Äîthat share an ambition to scale up sustainable infrastructure investments in developing countries. SDIP was launched at the United Nations Conference on Financing for Development in Addis Ababa in July 2015 with 20 founding members, which has since expanded to 30. The World Economic Forum and OECD provide institutional support to the partnership. The SDIP was set up because its members believe the world of development finance is often crowded and uncoordinated. According to the SDIP the aim is to adopt a practical approach and deliver scale, speed, transaction efficiency and risk mitigation. Their own goal is to achieve 100 billion dollars per year of additional finance over five years. SDIP supports inclusive growth and poverty alleviation through investments in areas such as water and sanitation systems, transportation, clean energy, agriculture, health, telecommunications and climate adaptation. SDIP uses blended finance by creating a platform where public and private entities can interact by co-investing and coordinating on a pipeline of specific projects. In order to mobilize private sector investment, members of the partnership collaborate to review practical experience in individual investment projects with a view toward scaling up existing initiatives, sharing existing knowledge, tools and new approaches to financing. SDIP's inaugural meeting took place in Geneva, Switzerland, on 15 September 2015. Membership SDIP has 30 members. The partnership is open to governments, local and global private banks, institutional investors and other public and private financiers, development finance institutions and bilateral and multilateral development banks and other organizations committed to providing substantial energy and resources to support the various activities of the partnership. #Agence fran√ßaise de d√©veloppement (AFD) #Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation #Government of Canada #Citigroup #Government of Denmark #Development Bank of South Africa (DBSA) #Deutsche Bank #East Capital #European Investment Bank (EIB) #European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) #FMO #HSBC #Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) #Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) #International Finance Corporation (IFC) #The Investment Fund for Developing Countries (IFU) #Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) #Meridiam #Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) #Government of the Netherlands #Government of Norway #Pension Danmark #Pensionskassernes Administration (PKA) #The Sovereign Fund for Strategic Investment (FONSIS) #Standard Chartered #Storebrand # Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC) #Government of Sweden #Government of the United Kingdom #United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Africa hub The SDIP was founded to help bridge the huge funding gap towards the SDGs; thus a large share of the projects are located in Sub-Saharan Africa. Of the $30 billion projects SDIP is facilitating worldwide, over $20 billion are located in Africa. Consequently, the partnership has dedicated an African hub within which the partnership is looking to build local capacity and ease the exchange of best practices across its network of institutions.

An attractive evergreen shrub to small tree grown ornamentally outside of its native range, it is believed to be the most frost hardy of all the Acacia.  Description  Erect and bushy shrub or tree 4‚Äì6 m highLynch, A.J.J., (1994) Conservation biology and management of 16 rare or threatened Fabaceae species in Tasmania (Doctoral dissertation, University of Tasmania). (rarely to 9 m) and variable width belonging to the subgenus Phyllodineae. Bark and branches pruinose. Young branches are angular and may be reddish brown where exposed to direct sunlight.Pers. Obs. A.M.Pataczek Adult foliage is of flattened leaf stalks (known as Phyllodes), grey-green to a bluish-glaucous colour, glabrous, on raised stem-projections, variable in shape and size, (narrowly oblong- elliptic to oblanceolate, sometimes obovate) but more commonly obliquely elliptic, 2‚Äì6 cm (<10 cm) long, 8‚Äì20 mm (<50 mm) wide, with a sharp leaf tip, prominent thickened margins and midrib. On the upper margin approx. 2‚Äì4 mm (<10) from the base of the phyllode a conspicuous, small, oval shaped gland is present. Inflorescence occurs mostly in spring in axillary racemes longer than the phyllodes, consisting of 10-15 bright yellow globular flowers resulting in seed pods that are flat and narrowly oblong 2.5-4.5 cm long and 7‚Äì11 mm wide. The purplish brown pod contains 3-6 flattened, brown seeds.  Taxonomy  Acacia pataczekii, D.I.Morris, Rec. Q. Vic. Mus. 50: 1 (1974). This species was first described by Dennis I. Morris in 1974 after having been brought to the Tasmanian Herbarium's attention by forester and plant collector, Wolfgang \\"Wally\\" F. Pataczek (1932-2009) in 1970, and 1972 and subsequently the discovery named in his honour. It has been mistaken in the past as A. melanoxylon, A. myrtifoliia, and A. mucronata and has been suggested to be a hybrid due to its rarity and limited sexual reproduction, however has multiple morphological differences. Most closely related to A. kettlewelliae, which is distinguished especially by its more elongate phyllodes with the gland 5‚Äì15 mm above the pulvinus and pods 5‚Äì10 cm long and is a species that occurs only on the mainland of Australia.  Distribution and habitat  Acacia pataczekii is native to the Australian island state of Tasmania with a limited range in pockets predominantly within the north east at altitudes between approx. 500‚Äì1400 m asl, however natural populations do occur in the Southern Midlands Region and also does well under cultivation at sea level. It naturally exists as a shrub layer, understory tree or as scattered individuals in moist gullies and flats, mountain summits, slopes and plateau scarps in low woodland to tall open, dry, wet and mixed Eucalyptus forests, most of which dominated by Eucalyptus delegatensis.  Ecology  In its native range A. pataczekii grows in a cool temperate climate, however at altitude is exposed to harsh cold winds, frost and snow. It survives on a range of soils, aspects and slopes in areas that receive from 750 mm to 1500 mm of rain annually. On some sites soils are shallow and exposed to high levels of evaporation indicating drought tolerance and it has also been shown to have an efficient water transport system. It reproduces both sexually and vegetatively, freely suckering from rhizomes and the tree base following disturbance such as tree fall, animal digging and fire. Flowers are most likely pollinated by bees, but flies and spiders have been sighted that could also. Successful fertilisation leading to fruit and seed formation is severely hindered due to insect predation and galling of flowers. Following fire or other gap forming disturbance seed from previous year's fruit or from within the soil seed bank readily germinate yet A. pataczekii is sensitive high fire frequency. Root rot caused by the fungus Phytophthora cinnamomi has a slight detrimental impact. As with other members of the Fabacaea family, A. pataczekii fixes atmospheric nitrogen with root nodules into the soil, making it available for other plants and local ecosystem. Hybridisation has been reported with A. dealbata amongst wild stands and in cultivation.  Conservation  Acacia pataczekii is listed as Rare under the Threatened Species Protection (TSP) Act 1995 under Tasmanian legislation. It is an offense to destroy or collect wild material without a permit. Restrictions apply to the export of plant material however there is no regulation to import the seed in to Australia. Healthy populations exist on reserved land at Ben Lomond National Park, Gravelly Ridge Conservation Area and St Paul's Regional Reserve. Other populations occur on private land and timber production forest. Special precaution must be taken when timber is harvested and mineral prospectors may not pursue mining licenses due to potential damage and conservation requirements. Ex situ conservation measures include seed orchards and restoration plantings and stored seed. Increasing fire frequency, land clearing, insect attack and Phytophthora cinnamomi appear to be the greatest threats which would be lessened with an increase in areas reserved. Acacia pataczekii is not known to be an invasive species outside of its native range.  Cultivation  An uncommon and highly sought after garden plant, Pataczek's wattle is best suited in a sunny to partly shaded wind protected area in cool or warm temperate climates. A hardy plant, reported to survive -18 ¬∞C in winter and is drought tolerant it can be grown in most soil types. Recommended USDA Zone 7b to 8. With a medium to fast growth rate, 2‚Äì3 m height can occur within 5 years from seedling, about the same time it takes to flower. Grown in botanic and residential gardens around the world, it can be used as an informal hedge, screen or specimen plant. In late winter to early spring buds form and explode into a mass of bright yellow flowers, often obscuring the foliage. A second flush of flowers can occur in summer in suitable conditions. New foliage is blue-green and silky to the touch and set amongst red brown angular stems. Suckering can occur when soil is disturbed adjacent, but can be kept in a pot if soil is kept moist.

He was born in Giannitsa, Central Macedonia, which at the time of his birth was part of the Ottoman Empire. He studied medicine in Padua, Italy. In 1913, he moved to Thessaloniki when his home region became part of Greece in the aftermath of the Balkan Wars. From 1919 to 1936, he served in the Hellenic Parliament for the Thessaloniki-Pella constituency. He served as Minister of Health, Welfare and Care in the first government of Panagis Tsaldaris (1932‚Äì1933). In the parliamentary elections of 1936, he was leader of the National Reform Party. After the German invasion of Greece, he supported collaboration with the Axis powers. On April 30, 1941, he was appointed minister of finance in the collaborationist government of Georgios Tsolakoglou. After the dismissal of Tsolakoglou on December 2, 1942, Gotzamanis continued in his post in the government of Konstantinos Logothetopoulos. His ministry also oversaw agriculture, industry, trade and labor. When Logothetopoulos was dismissed in 1943, the Italians favored him to succeed Logothetopoulos as Prime Minister of Greece, but the position went to Ioannis Rallis instead. As the Axis forces withdraw from Greece in 1944, Gotzamanis fled to Italy and then Nazi Germany. In his absence, a Greek court sentenced him to death in January 1945 for treason. He returned to Greece several years later and was a candidate for mayor of Thessaloniki in 1954. He participated in the elections of 11 May 1958.

As Vatican City invested ‚Ç¨3 million to obtain its own pavilion at the event before his appointment to the papacy, Francis said that, although it is a good thing that the Church is involved in causes that battle hunger and promote cleaner energy, he stated that too much money was wasted on the Expo itself by Vatican City.

He was successively assistant at Le Charivari, director of l'Entr'acte, co-founder of la Com√©die parisienne, editor at Le Figaro, founder of Le Grand Journal with Hippolyte de Villemessant, and columnist at l'√âv√©nement before he took over the management of l‚ÄôEntr‚Äôacte in 1870.

The pillar is of local stone, high, and topped with a drum and finial, which replaced the original gilded ball after a lightning strike in 1847. A granite panel states that it was erected by the \\"Gentlemen of Montgomeryshire\\" to commemorate the naval successes of Admiral Rodney including the Battle of the Saints.

Early life and education Tim Stead was born in 1952 and brought up near Helsby one of four brothers, in rural Cheshire. He was educated at Heronwater Prep School [now Coed Coch] and The Leys School, Cambridge. He attended art-school at Nottingham Trent University, School of Art and Design and undertook a post-diploma course at Glasgow School of ArtDemarco, Richard Artwork No. 105, August/September 2000.

(Editor) 'With the Grain' Birlinn 2005 Sculpturally, Stead's work did not appear to derive from any particular art historical tradition although the ideas of Brancusi, Beuys and Hundertwasser, amongst others, were central to his vision. Early on, he rejected Conceptualism, particularly in the way it was practiced at Trent Polytechnic in Nottingham, where he completed the early part of his training. An early work, 'Burnt Tower with Creaking Pendulum‚Äô contains most of his essential vocabulary, later expanded and refined. The piece shows items of worn driftwood bound together with rope, spectacularly off centre and asymmetrical.Sutherland, Giles 'Assessing a Lifetime's Achievements' The Scotsman 26 April 2000 =Furniture= Stead's work as a furniture maker could not be separated from his ideas as a sculptor. His furniture owed something to Art Nouveau, in particular Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Majorelle and Victor Horta; his training at Glasgow School of Art was influential in this respect. In his post-graduate year at Glasgow School of Art and in the year following, Stead's early use of abandoned and found materials developed into the use of hardwoods, some imported. Stead later committed to using only native timbers, notably burred elm and other 'imperfect' wood previously considered unfit for anything other than firewood, though now become highly desirable. He was attracted by thrift and by the heightened singularity of these timbers and the challenge of making virtues of their apparent unsuitability for furniture.Fraser, Alex 'Wildwood' Artizana 1997 Stead had begun exploiting the waney edge of the timber before learning of the work of George Nakashima who wrote The Soul of a Tree, a book highly respected by Stead as expressing much of his own feelings and beliefs. =Poetry= The first volume of his poems (Towers published posthumously in 2000Stead, Tim 'Towers' No Butts 2000 ) ‚Äì all written between 1998 and 1999‚Äì deal in part with Stead's chosen sculptural medium:wood. A second volume of poems light & dark was published in 2002.Stead, Tim 'light & dark' No Butts 2002 Notable Commissions =Cafe Gandolfi= At Glasgow School of Art while studying for his post-graduate diploma, Stead met lain Mackenzie who was then working in the photography department. After leasing the derelict Old Cheesemarket offices in the then run-down Merchant City area. Mackenzie asked Stead to build and install all the components necessary for a complete refurbishment ‚Äì chairs, tables, an eight-seater bench and a bar. Deriving its name from the famous Gandolfi Brothers cameras, the caf√© opened in 1979. =Papal Throne= His most famous commission is the Papal Chair he made for the visit of John Paul II to Scotland in 1982. The Pope celebrated mass at Murrayfield Stadium in July and Stead's chair was the centrepiece at the ceremony. It was commissioned privately by the Polish priest Ryszard Haluka. The commission required the representation on the chair of the four gospels of the New Testament -Matthew, Mark, Luke and John- by their respective symbols: the lion, the angel, the eagle and the bull. The chair, made from elm, was inlaid in a form of marquetry with various other woods. =St. John's Chapel, The Kirk of St. Nicholas, Aberdeen= In 1989 Stead was commissioned by the North Sea Oil Industries to design and make the fittings for a new Memorial Chapel in the Kirk of St Nicholas, Aberdeen. This originally involved forty chairs, a lectern, communion table and a minister's chair. Later this extended to include a screen which would divide the chapel form the rest of the kirk. The communion table, made in ash and walnut has a slightly ovoid shape representing the bow of a ship and a plough, and has inlays related to Christian symbols such as the fish and the cross. For the chairs Stead used ash and sycamore for the frames and a whole series of woods- walnut, rowan, maple, beech and yew- for a series of slats at the back of the chairs which spell out (if you know what the woods are and write down the initial letters of their names) 'We Remember Yew'.Carr, Richard 'Kirk Commissions' Crafts, September 1990 =The Millenium Clock= Towards the end of the twentieth century, Tim and a group of artists and makers: Eduard Bersudsky (of Sharmanka Kinetic Gallery), Annica Sandstr√∂m and Jurgen T√ºbbecke made a proposal to the National Museum of Scotland to make a marker and memorial for the year 2000, a great Millenium Clock.Jones, M. 'The Metamorphosis of Wood'from Sutherland, G. (Editor) 'With the Grain' Birlinn 2005 Exhibitions =Layers= The work in the touring exhibition 'Layers' represented a fundamental departure for Stead in a number of respects. This was the first exhibition composed exclusively of non-functional, sculptural pieces- and in a gallery setting. 'Layers' was first shown at the Compass Gallery, Glasgow in 1990.'layers. an exploration in wood by Tim Stead' Exhibition Catalogue, Compass Gallery All the 'Layers' pieces carried an invitation ‚Äì 'Please Touch'. =Scotland Creates= In 1990 Stead exhibited at the McLellan Galleries' 'Scotland Creates' exhibition which celebrated 5.000 years of art and design in Scotland. The organisers, Barbara and Murray Grigor, invited Stead to re- create one of the houses in the Neolithic Orkney village of Skara Brae, in the main service-lift shaft in the gallery. Stead's Skara Brae was more of an interpretation of the original than a replica. It consisted of thousands of stone-shaped blocks of split wood ‚Äì mainly elm. To accompany the Skara Brae exhibit, Stead made a variety of artefacts derived from actual Neolithic archaeological finds. While the purpose of many of these artefacts remains obscure, one important aspect was undoubtedly their tactile quality. The touching and handling of his work was always something Stead was keen to encourage. =The Botanic Ash and Explorations in Wood= In 1992 the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh gave Stead a 50-meter high, nearly two centuries old ash tree to 'explore'. He took this as an opportunity to reveal and display the inner life of this great tree. The resulting work The Botanic Ash was exhibited the following year in The Caledonian Hall alongside Explorations in Wood- an exhibition of sculpture and furniture in Inverleith House both at the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh.Macdonald, Murdo The Scotsman 26 April 2000  References  Category:1952 births Category:2000 deaths Category:20th-century British sculptors Category:British male sculptors Category:Alumni of Nottingham Trent University Category:British furniture makers Category:People from Helsby Category:Members of the Order of the British Empire ","title":"Tim Stead"},{"id":"50397617","text":"Road of Hell (Spanish:Camino del infierno) is a 1951 Mexican thriller film directed by Miguel Morayta and starring Pedro Armend√°riz, Leticia Palma and Wolf Ruvinskis.Agras√°nchez p.191 The film's art direction was by Gunther Gerszo.

The house is now the 1774 Inn, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. Description and history The McCobb‚ÄìHill‚ÄìMinott House is located in the central village of Phippsburg, on the north side of Parker Head Road, overlooking the Kennebec River to the east. It is a roughly square two-story wood frame structure, with a hip roof, and clapboard siding. The roof has a large cupola at its center, covered by a low-pitch roof, with windows and three sides and a door on the fourth, providing access to the roof and chimneys. It has principal facades facing southeast and northwest, with center entrances framed by Doric pilasters and gabled pediments. A long ell extends northwest from the northeast face, joining the house to a barn; these additions date to the late 18th century. The house was built by Isaac Packard in 1774 for James McCobb, a major landowner and local political leader during the American Revolution. One of McCobb's daughters married Mark Langdon Hill, who partnered with his brother- in-law Thomas McCobb in the establishment of a local shipyard and merchant business. Hill was politically active, serving as one Maine's first representatives in the United States Congress after it achieved statehood in 1820. After Hill's death, the house was purchased by Charles V.

He disappeared on 6 January 1967, and his remains were found ten days later in the village of Tattingstone, Suffolk. His body had been cut into eight pieces and left in two suitcases. For this reason the crime is sometimes referred to as the Tattingstone Suitcase Murder. The case received widespread media attention, partly because police, unable to identify the body, took the unusual step of releasing a photograph of the victim's head to the media. The murder remains unsolved. Disappearance and murder On Friday, 6 January 1967, Oliver did not return home after spending the evening with friends, and was reported missing by his father the following morning. Several days later, on 16 January, farm worker Fred Burggy discovered human remains in two suitcases left behind a hedge in a field near the village of Tattingstone, Suffolk. It was believed that the murder had occurred around 48 hours before the discovery of the body. Post-mortem tests showed that Oliver had been sexually assaulted and strangled before his body was dismembered. Unable to determine the identity of the victim, police took the unusual step of releasing a photograph of the victim's head to the media. Oliver's family contacted the police after seeing the photograph. Investigation The police investigation was initially headed by Detective Superintendent Tom Tarling of East Suffolk Police, before being taken over by Detective Superintendent Harry Tappin of the Metropolitan Police. The location of the murder has never been identified, although police believed that the murder and dismemberment had taken place in Suffolk. Following the murder, witnesses reported sightings of Oliver in and around the Muswell Hill area in the time between his disappearance and the discovery of his body. In Tattingstone, a witness said she saw ‚Äúa man, who was middle-aged and wearing a dark trilby and a long trench coat, walking in the direction of Tattingstone on the Harwich road, carrying a suitcase‚Äù on the night the suitcases were left. Several pieces of physical evidence were recovered. One of the two suitcases used to contain Oliver's remains bore the initials ‚ÄúP.V.A.‚Äù. The laundry mark ‚ÄúQL 42‚Äù was also found on a hand towel inside one of the two suitcases. A matchbox found in the pocket of Oliver's jacket was from a brand of matches marketed in Israel. The investigation was re-opened in 1977. In 2012, a man reported seeing two unattended suitcases and a man wearing medical gloves in the Ipswich docks area days before Oliver's body was discovered. The investigation was once again re-opened in 2017 when police appealed for any information concerning the murder. Suspects In 2004, documents released under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 revealed that the prime suspects in the murder were two medical doctors, Martin Reddington and John Byles. Martin Bruce Reddington (26 June 1931-May 1995) had a surgery in Muswell Hill. In 1965 a warrant had been issued for Reddington's arrest on charges of buggery and indecent assault of males. However, before inquiries could be completed, he left the U.K. for South Africa. Reddington made a number of return visits to the U.K., but no evidence has been found placing him in the vicinity of the murder. In 1977, a private investigator claimed to recognise the suitcase with the initials P.V.A. on its side as belonging to three men who used a laundrette in Muswell Hill, one of whom was Reddington. Reddington was never interviewed in connection with the offence, and it was decided there was insufficient evidence to extradite him from Australia. In 1977 Reddington was charged in Sydney with committing an indecent assault on a male. He died in May 1995, aged 63. John Roussel Byles (January 27, 1933-19 January 1975) was acquitted along with another man in November 1963 of assaulting a 16-year-old male at their flat in Earl's Court, London. Byles left the U.K. for Australia in the early 1970s when inquiries began into the sexual abuse of boys aged between 9 and 14 in Huddersfield. On 17 December 1974, Byles was arrested in Sydney in relation to an alleged indecent assault on a boy, but absconded on $2,000 bail. His body was found in a room of the Prince of Wales Hotel in Proserpine, Queensland on 19 January 1975. He left two suicide notes, one addressed to Scotland Yard, the other to Reddington. The note to the police contained an apology for his actions, but no direct reference was made to the Tattingstone murder. Reddington and Byles are also said to have been suspects in the murder of a boy in London in 1973, following an apparent homosexual relationship. Joe Meek (5 April 1929 ‚Äì 3 February 1967) was a record producer and songwriter who ran a recording studio at 304 Holloway Road, Islington, in North London. Police in the Oliver investigation announced their intent to interview all of the homosexual men in London. This would have included Meek, following a 1963 conviction for ‚Äúimportuning for immoral purposes‚Äù in a public toilet. Some accounts claim that Meek was afraid of being questioned. It was rumoured that Oliver had worked as a tape-stacker in Meek's studio. On 3 February 1967, Meek killed himself after murdering his landlady, Violet Shenton. Reginald Kray (24 October 1933 ‚Äì 1 October 2000) was a gangster from the East End of London, sentenced to life imprisonment along with his brother Ronald in 1969 for the murders of George Cornell and Jack McVitie. In September 2000, Kray confessed to a previously unknown murder while being interviewed for the BBC documentary Reggie Kray: The Final Word. A former cellmate of Kray's, Pete Gillett, claimed that Kray had also confessed the murder to him, and that the victim was ‚Äúa young gay boy‚Äù. It has been suggested that this is a reference to Oliver's murder, although the confession is widely believed to relate to the disappearance of Edward ‚ÄúMad Teddy‚Äù Smith in 1967. The Kray brothers were sent to Suffolk as evacuees during World War II, and bought a house at Bildeston ‚Äì approximately from Tattingstone ‚Äì in 1968. In popular culture The murder of Bernard Oliver forms part of the background to the 1998 novel The Long Firm, by Jake Arnott.

A Grade II* listed building, it is the oldest standing building in the county borough. The use of the site for worship dates back to pre-Norman times, with references to the church in a poem written in the 9th or 10th century. The church was probably rebuilt by the Cistercians in the late 12th century. Much of what remains (particularly the saddleback west tower and the barrel roofs) suggests more rebuilding around 1500. Further refurbishment was completed in 1888‚Äì91. The church closed for the first time in the 1930s because of subsidence from nearby coalmining. It was repaired and reopened in 1943, before closing again because of open cast mining in 1957. After the open cast operations ended in 1962, the church was found to have deteriorated further and was closed permanently. The church was sold into private hands after closure. It was eventually acquired by Blaenau Gwent Borough Council in 1984 and has been restored to a safe condition. It is open to visitors and is sometimes used as a venue for community events.

It offers services to residents from Kayunga district and neighboring districts including Kamuli, Buikwe, Mukono, Luweero and Nakasongola. According to a 2009 published report, Kayunga Hospital had a dilapidated and crumbling infrastructure, aging equipment and machinery, under-staffing, poor staff remuneration, overwhelming patient numbers, and under-funding. Renovations and improvements In 2016, the Government of Uganda secured loans from Middle Eastern lenders totaling USh70 billion (approx. US$19 million), to renovate the dilapidated hospital and equipment, as well as construct new staff housing. The renovations are funded by loans from the (a) Saudi Fund for Development, (b) Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa (BADEA) and (c) OPEC Fund for International Development (OFID). After delays, blamed on \\"bureaucracy within the Ministry of Health\\", the actual work started in early 2018. The scope of the renovations include (1) a new Emergency Department (Casualty) (2) new operating rooms (theatres) (3) new out-patient department (4) new administration office block (5) expansion of the in-patient wards (6) new staff housing (7) rehabilitation of the water supply system (8) rehabilitation of the sewerage collection and disposal system. The expansion and renovations are expected to conclude in 2020, with a total bed capacity of 300, and the conversion of Kayunga Hospital, to Kayunga Regional Referral Hospital.

Built in 1798-1800 to a design by William Sprat (or Sprats), a prominent housewright from Litchfield, Connecticut, it is a fine example of period Federal architecture. It was built for Simeon Smith, a wealthy businessman who moved here from Connecticut. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The Simeon Smith House stands in a rural area of far eastern West Haven, on the north side of Main Road, a short way west of its junction with Vermont Route 22A, the principal north-south route in the area. The house is a 2-1/2 story I-house, built of wood, with a gable roof, clapboard siding, and rubblestone foundation. The main facade faces the road to the south, and has a central entrance flanked by sidelight windows and topped by a cornice. Windows are 19th-century two-over-two sash, with flanking shutters, and the roof line has a modillioned eave. The interior follows a center hall plan on the ground floor, and has a large, elaborately decorated ballroom taking up most of the second floor. An ell extends to the left, dating to a 1920s renovation done after a fire damaged an older ell. The house was built in 1798-1800 for Simeon Smith, a wealthy businessman who had moved to the area (then part of Fair Haven) in 1787 from northwestern Connecticut. Smith's relationship with the designer William Sprat is not well understood. Sprat was active in the Litchfield, Connecticut area, and was apparently hired by Smith to at least draw up plans for this house; it is unclear if he actually worked on it. Smith and Sprat are buried in adjacent plots in a West Haven Cemetery. See also *Gov.

The letters expressed his desire to be reunited with his family and his anger at his wife's owners. Later, he was ordained a minister in the AME church and served congregations in Missouri, New Mexico, and Colorado. In 1882, he founded the first AME church in New Mexico.

One daughter, Mary, was born in Missouri on May 1, 1852 and married in 1882. Mary was interviewed and provided a slave narrative for the Works Progress Administration Writer's Program. Slavery Before emancipation, Rice's wife and all of his children were owned by a single woman named Kitty Diggs. Rice was owned by a tobacco plantation owner named Benjamin Lewis, where Rice was the head slave on the plantation, and cured and rolled the tobacco. Lewis' son taught Rice to read, to the chagrin of the elder Lewis. He was only allowed to visit Arry and his family two days a week, Wednesdays and Saturdays. He was frequently beaten by his owner. One time he tried to escape. During his escape, he hid in the woods and under houses, but after three days he gave up. He turned himself in to a slave trader he knew who promised to buy him from Lewis. However, Lewis would not sell Rice, and he was forced to remain on the plantation. The Emancipation Proclamation was published January 1, 1863. Rice read about it in the newspapers to the other slaves on the Lewis plantation. Lewis greatly valued Rice on the plantation: in fact, he tried to convince Rice to stay and run the farm and to convince the other slaves to stay as well. Rice remained for six months, but then left the plantation with eleven other slaves and joined the Union Army in Kansas City. Patrols hunting for Lewis' slaves were turned away when they approached the Union camps, as they were no longer slaves but were Union soldiers. Civil War Benton Barracks Parade March.

While there in September 1864, Rice wrote two letters, one to his daughters who were still enslaved in Howard County and the other to Kitty Diggs, their owner.

It offers independent advice to the government on immigration policy, and particularly on the Shortage Occupation List. When occupations are placed on this list, UK employers have less restrictions for recruiting candidates directly from overseas; specifically from outside the EU. They would no longer need to complete a residency test, which involves demonstrating that a search for suitable candidates within the UK in the first instance has been unsuccessful. In October 2011, actuaries were added to the UK Government's shortage occupation list. They were removed from the list in April 2013 following a consultation by the Committee in January 2013. They recommended that employers hiring skilled workers from outside the European Union should have to pay ¬£1,000 surcharge per head in January 2016 as an incentive to train more British staff. The Committee produced a report in 2016 in which they heavily criticised the Department of Health, Health Education England and NHS trusts for not recognising obvious warning signs over a number of years, and \\"reluctantly\\" agreed to keep nursing on the list of shortage occupations. It produced a report on seasonal labour in horticulture after the abolition of the Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme. The changes to the immigration rules in 2012, which affect the settlement of non-European economic area workers with tier II visas earning less than ¬£35,000 were based on the recommendations of the committee.

Seshathetep held many important titles, possibly including that of vizier. With this latter title, he would have been the most important official at the royal court, second only to the king. He also bore the title of king's son of his body, yet it is doubtful that Seshathetep was the real son of a king. Before becoming vizier, Seshathetep was overseer of all royal works. Seshathetep is mainly known to us from his tomb at Giza. His tomb is a mastaba with a chapel on the south-east side. The chapel is fully decorated and relatively well preserved. Also depicted in the tomb are his wife Merites, one son who was also called Seshathetep and another son called Heti. The title of vizier is not recorded on the tomb walls but appears on a statue unearthed in the mastaba. This suggests that he was promoted to this high office after the decoration of the tomb was finished. However, the statue in question, which shows a couple, is damaged and the names of the people represented have been lost. Therefore, some scholars argue that the statue belongs to different people and that Seshathetep may not have been a vizier.

The series was made and released following the success of the 2012 Ultra Series movie, Ultraman Saga, and is a tribute to the low-budget series, Ultra Fight. The miniseries is divided into two seasons, , which consists of 8 episodes from August 1 to September 9, 2012, and which consists of 15 episodes from December 12, 2012 to March 27, 2013. A DVD release of this miniseries was sold online on June 21, 2013, under the label . Story =A New Power= Four monsters - Bemular, Telesdon, Sadola, and Gudon - are mysteriously revived at the Monster Graveyard. Ultraman Zero eliminates them and then meets their master, Alien Bat Glacier, who introduces his monster army, the Four Beast Warriors of Hell. Zero tries to attack, however, Glacier quickly traps him inside the Techtor Gear Hatred, armor which was created from the grudges of deceased monsters. Zero then suffers a one- sided defeat by Ex Red King. Pigmon, a small monster who Glacier accidentally revived, watches the battle from a safe distance. Ex Red King notices Pigmon and tries to eliminate him, but Zero absorbs the attack and uses his StrongCorona Zero form to escape before killing the monster. Later, Zero and Pigmon find themselves trapped in a pocket dimension. While trying to escape, Zero recalls his reason for arriving at the Monster Graveyard, and tries to understand why Ultraman Dyna's and Cosmos's powers remained inside him after their last battle together. Suddenly, Glacier appears and brings Zero his next opponent: two clones of his alternate forms. He quickly realizes that his opponents are the images of his fear (and powers), and he faces them, defeating the true enemy, Galberos, and escaping from the pocket dimension. Once he is free, Glacier releases two monsters, Gan Q and Bemstar. As they fight Zero through the use of a wormhole connection, Zero assumes his second alternate form, LunaMiracle Zero, and kills them in one swoop. Once the monsters are defeated, Glacier reveals that the Four Beast Warriors of Hell had achieved their purpose, and he absorbs their resentment in a climactic fight against Zero. In the middle of the battle, he exploits Pigmon by revealing that their life force is connected so that if Glacier dies, Pigmon would also die. Zero is forced to submit to Glacier's torture, however, Pigmon reassures him, which allows Zero to fight back by splitting into his alternate forms. LunaMiracle Zero separates Glacier from the restless monster spirits and saves Pigmon's life, then StrongCorona Zero uses Garnate Buster to defeat Glacier. In the aftermath of the battle, Zero finds the purpose of his new powers and reunites with his comrades. =Shining Zero= Five groups of aliens, known as the Darkness Five, discover Zero's capabilities from Glacier. Meanwhile, on a distant world, King Silvergon wreaks havoc on a planet that belonged to the Fanegon people. Ultraman Zero interferes and tames it using his LunaMiracle Zero form. The Mother of Ultra appears and tells Zero that the Ultimate Force Zero have been turned into bronze statues. While investigating, Zero discovers the \\"Mother of Ultra\\" is Alien Hipporito Jathar, and that he is also going to be turned into a bronze statue. However, he uses this opportunity and finishes Jathar, saving himself and other victims from petrifaction. Victory is short-lived as another enemy appears in the form of Alien Temperor Villainous and his pet monster, Tyrant. Alien Mefilas Sly takes Pigmon hostage during the battle and attempts to lure Zero to the Monster Graveyard. Alien Groza Glocken and Alien Deathre Deathlog join the fight. Zero is weakened but aided by Ultimate Force Zero, allowing Zero to race to the Monster Graveyard. Zero quickly defeats Sly and frees Pigmon, but the true enemy appears to be Kaiser Darkness, who is actually Ultraman Belial. During the fight, Kaiser Darkness is revealed to be an empty shell which houses Belial's restless spirit and eventually possesses Zero. As Zero plunges into darkness, Belial massacres the members of the Ultimate Force Zero. The real Ultraman Zero is left powerless, while Belial uses his body to lead the Darkness Five in conquest. Pigmon bravely tries to stop them, and Belial's attempt to kill Pigmon is mysteriously stopped. Zero was able to halt Belial, and brings forth his strongest form, Shining Zero. As Belial is expelled, Shining Zero regains control over his body and reverses time to undo the damage caused by Belial, reviving the Ultimate Force Zero. This exhausts him and he loses some memories. He joins his comrades in returning home as they try to pick a new name for Pigmon. After the end credits, it is revealed that Shining Zero's time-reversal technique had also revived Belial. Realizing that Zero's strength comes from protecting those dear to him, Belial undertakes to make himself stronger while maintaining his leadership in the Darkness Five. Jathar is also revealed to have survived his apparent death.

Testing of the confectioneries revealed they were laced with the highly toxic insecticide chlorfenapyr. One of the owners, Khalid Mahmood confessed to mixing the pesticide into the sweets after an argument with his brother and co-owner. Causes A pesticide shop, close by the bakery where the sweets were bought, was being renovated, and the owner had left his products at the bakery for safekeeping. Mahmood may have used a small packet in the sweet mixture. A man bought 5 kg of laddu for the celebration of a newborn on 17 April. At least 50 people consumed the sweets and ten of them died the same day. On 25 April, the death toll rose to 23 with 52 people still being treated at various hospitals. On 1 May the death toll rose to 33 with 13 people in hospital. The baby lost his father, six of his uncles and one aunt. Aftermath Two shop owners, and one worker, were initially arrested. Two weeks later the police announced that Mahmood had confessed. The Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif, stated that the incident would be thoroughly investigated, and ordered the police to find and take action against the responsible people. The Chief Minister of Punjab, Shehbaz Sharif, visited Layyah on 2 May, and expressed his condolences and regrets for the loss of life.

Manufactured in Taras (modern Taranto) in 330-320 BCE, it is thought to be the only known artistic depiction of a lost play by Sophocles, Thyestes at Sikyon. It is currently on display in gallery 215C of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, Massachusetts, after having been purchased by them from Fritz B√ºrki and Son on February 25, 1987. Description This krater stands 63.5 cm (25 in) tall and has a diameter at the rim of 58.5 cm (23 in). The style is Apulian red-figure, meaning that it is from the region of southern Italy called Apulia, and that the background and figure details and outlines are painted with a black paint, while the figures themselves are left unpainted. It is in the Ornate style as well, many of which feature pots where figures range all over the surface, as is the case with this one. There are two distinct sides to the krater. On one side, Dionysus reclines with two satyrs and two maenads around him. On the other side, Thyestes is protesting to king Adrastos the impending exposure (left out in the wilds, presumably to die) of his son Aegisthos, while Adrastos‚Äô wife comforts the baby‚Äôs mother, Thyestes‚Äô daughter Pelopeia. Several gods range over all the mortals: Artemis, who is telling Pan to find a goat to nurse the baby; Apollo, a Fury, and a nude youth who is the personification of the city Sikyon, where this is all taking place. Ancient viewers would have been familiar enough with the play to recognize the play and the myth behind the play, which we know through Hyginus‚Äô Fabulae 87-88. It is a particularly gruesome myth, although none of the gruesomeness is pictured outright here: it is up to the viewer‚Äôs familiarity to recognize that Thyestes raped his daughter because Apollo told a prophecy that a son born of that union would kill Thyestes‚Äô brother Atreus, against whom he has a grudge. It is impossible to know now why Atreus, so critical to the plot of the myth, is not depicted on the pot or, presumably, in the play itself. Also unknown are the significance of several objects drawn on the pot: a yellow object in Aegisthos‚Äô hand, which Vermeule recognizes as the hilt of the sword that will later confirm that Aegisthos is the son of Thyestes, although that interpretation of the object is not without criticism. Also drawn is a necklace next to Pelopeia, which might have been important to the play. The play must also differ from the myth in Adrastos being king, which is not commonly cited, and the fact of Thyestes‚Äô presence at the exposure of Aegisthos, which is not in the myth we know. The inclusion of Dionysus on the other side may reference the fact that festivals to Dionysus often featured plays, of which this might have at one time been one. The krater is attributed to the Darius Painter, for similarity in several stylistic and iconographic elements. Called one of the most literate painters, this pot provides inscriptions labelling several of the important figures, which have been instrumental in identifying this pot with the play Thyestes at Sikyon, even though we don‚Äôt have the play itself.

It was released in China by EDKO (Beijing) Distribution on April 29, 2016. Book of Love is director-writer Xue Xiaolu's follow-up to the 2013 hit Finding Mr. Right, and it reunites her with lead actors Tang Wei and Wu Xiubo from the first movie, although the two films' plots are not related. Notably, the two leads have separate storylines throughout the movie, only communicating with each other through handwritten letters until their first meeting towards the end of the film. Plot Jiao Ye (played by Tang Wei) is a casino hostess in Macau who accompanies customers as they gamble and earns a living from their tips. Her father, who brought her to Macau from mainland China, was an inveterate gambler who has since died, leaving her with a large pile of debts and a gambling habit of her own. Despite this, she is a good-natured girl who balances her money problems with a longing to find some meaning in her life and a boyfriend she has feelings for. Daniel Luo (Wu Xiubo) is a real estate broker in Los Angeles who moved there with his parents from Beijing 20 years prior, although they subsequently divorced and both returned to China. Daniel has since built an outwardly successful life for himself in California, selling properties to wealthy Chinese buyers, but his parents' divorce when he was young still affects him, and he refuses to get into any kind of close emotional relationship. Both Jiao and Daniel come across an old book, 84 Charing Cross Road, which tells the story of New York writer Helene Hanff and her 20-year correspondence with British bookseller Frank Doel, whose shop was at 84 Charing Cross Road in London. Daniel and Jiao, both in foul moods and blaming the book for recent misfortunes in their lives, decide to get rid of it by mailing the book to the address in the title. Unbeknown to either of them, the current proprietor of 84 Charing Cross Road, Mr Thomas, is an elderly gentleman who enjoys matchmaking and redirects the letters from Jiao and Daniel to each other. Over the course of the next year, Daniel and Jiao begin a regular correspondence by sending letters to 84 Charing Cross Road, each believing the other to be a Chinese person living in London. Mr Thomas continues forwarding their letters without their knowledge. The letters are hostile at first, but eventually a genuine friendship develops. Jiao incurs a large debt and accompanies a rich client to Las Vegas to pay it off. Meanwhile, Daniel befriends an elderly Chinese couple who own a house he wants to buy, but since he knows they would never approve of his plan to tear their house down and replace it with two new ones, he tries an underhanded tactic to trick them into selling. As part of his plan, he also takes them to Las Vegas for a vacation, and nearly crosses paths with Jiao several times, although neither knows what the other looks like. Daniel begins to feel guilty about what he is doing, and his plan is eventually found out by the old couple. Jiao's relationship with her client ends, and she and Daniel console each other through their letters. Around the same time, they also both decide to reveal their real identities to each other. However, Mr Thomas passes away before the letters admitting their identities can be forwarded on, and both Jiao and Daniel believe the other person has decided to break off the relationship. They also have no way of getting in touch with each other anymore. Realizing their growing feelings for each other, and desperately seeking news of what has happened to the other person, Daniel and Jiao travel separately to 84 Charing Cross Road, where they learn the truth about who has been forwarding their letters, and are also told about Mr Thomas's upcoming funeral. At the service, they just miss finding each other, although Daniel realizes that Jiao was also in attendance when he sees a tribute card she leaves for Mr Thomas at the funeral. However, none of their attempts to locate the other person work. Having given up, both Daniel and Jiao return to 84 Charing Cross Road one last time to leave a farewell letter, where they finally meet. The film ends as the two stroll through London's South Bank at night, chatting about their lives. Cast\\"Âåó‰∫¨ÈÅá‰∏äË•øÈõÖÂõæ‰πã‰∏ç‰∫åÊÉÖ‰π¶ (2016)\\". douban.com.

Built between 1876 and 1878, it is the second such church on its site. The first, consecrated in 1813, was a replacement for a church of St Mary that was founded in 669 within the remains of the Roman fort at Reculver, about to the north-east, but was mostly demolished in 1809. The first church at Hillborough was poorly constructed, and was itself replaced by the present structure, designed by Joseph Clarke in the Gothic Revival style. It incorporates materials from the demolished church at Reculver, its baptismal font is probably from the medieval All Saints' Church, Shuart, that once stood on the Isle of Thanet, and it is included in the National Heritage List for England as a Grade II listed building. The Church of St Mary the Virgin, Reculver, is an active parish church in the diocese of Canterbury, the archdeaconry of Canterbury and the deanery of Reculver. Its benefice is united with those of St Bartholomew, Herne Bay, and Holy Cross, Hoath. History The present Church of St Mary the Virgin, Reculver, is the third church dedicated to the mother of Jesus to have served the same parish. The first church recorded in the vicinity was founded within the remains of the Roman fort of Regulbium in 669.; ; ; . Having stood for about 1,150 years and undergone much enlargement and embellishment, that church was mostly demolished in 1809 at the instigation of the then vicar, Christopher Naylor, partly because it had been at imminent risk of being washed away by the sea through coastal erosion. Further, the settlement that it once served had already been greatly diminished largely by the same process, and its displaced inhabitants had moved to Hillborough, about to the south-west. The second church for the parish was built at Hillborough on a plot of land bought for ¬£30: incorporating some materials from the old church, it was consecrated on 13 April 1813. In 1856 it was described as a \\"miserable little built in a rough and poverty-stricken style\\", and by 1874 it had a leaking roof and was already decaying. On 28 April 1874, when R. H. Blakey was inducted as vicar, the hope was expressed that \\"a new church may some day be erected which will in every way be more suited for the solemn uses of public worship.\\" Blakey raised funds for the building of a new church, and this is the structure which stands on the same plot of land today. It was begun in 1876 to a design drawn up by Joseph Clarke, who was surveyor for the diocese of Canterbury at the time. Costing ¬£1,400 to build, the new church was consecrated on 12 June 1878 in the presence of Edward Parry, Bishop of Dover, who noted in his address to the congregation that it carried a remaining debt of about ¬£200. On 14 May 1975, this structure was registered as a Grade II listed building for its architect, architectural style and date, and for its inclusion of materials from the old church at Reculver and a medieval baptismal font from a different church. As such it is included in the National Heritage List for England. Architecture and fittings Built in the Gothic Revival style, the Church of St Mary the Virgin is faced on the exterior with knapped flint, and has limestone dressings, for example forming the apertures for its lancet windows and at its corners. There is a diagonal buttress at each corner, and another buttress supports the centre of the west wall to the height of the roof line. At the top of the west wall is a masonry bellcote containing a single bell: this is a replacement for a bell made in 1635 by Joseph Hatch for the old church at Reculver and re-used in the present structure until 1970, when it was stolen. The roof is continuous for the full length of the chancel and nave, with a single ridge, and is covered in red clay tiles. These are continued to form a cat-slide roof covering a small, northward extension from the chancel that houses an organ. Interior of the Church of St Mary the Virgin in 2008, looking east from a position adjacent to the font The church is entered at the western end of the south wall through a porch containing a 13th-century doorway also from the old church at Reculver, comprising a \\"many- moulded arch and keeled nook-shafts with simple foliage capitals.\\" Further stone fragments from the old church are incorporated into the interior, for example in the walls where the nave and chancel meet, and some 17th-century memorials are laid in the floor. The font, located on the north side of the west end of the nave, also pre-dates the present structure, and probably originated in the medieval All Saints' Church, Shuart, on the Isle of Thanet: All Saints' has been only a matter of historical record since at least 1630. The font was \\"rescued from a state of neglect, and ... presented to the [new] church by John Rammell, ... of Shuart, St Nicholas[-at-Wade].\\" It is octagonal, in the Perpendicular style of the 14th to 15th centuries, lined with lead and supported by a modern plinth. The interior walls of the church are rendered with plaster and painted white, except where stonework such as the window apertures is left bare. The structures of the chancel and nave are distinguished only by width ‚Äì the chancel being slightly narrower than the nave ‚Äì and differing treatment of the roof space. While the ceiling in the nave is formed by the shape of the roof, there the latter is supported by exposed tie beams and crown posts. In the chancel, the ceiling is a barrel vault formed by seven longitudinal wooden panels painted blue, which are trimmed with strips of timber painted white and forming squares. An extension comprising a vestry of similar external appearance to the rest of the church, apart from a flat roof and rectangular windows, was added to the southern side of the chancel in 1963. The church's Communion vessels include a silver cup, paten and flagon dated 1684, made by \\"T.C.\\" and inscribed as being gift of John Hills of Reculver, Churchwarden, 1685.\\" Stained glass in the windows is all modern, none having survived from the old church at Reculver. An organ, built in 1955 by F. H. Browne & Sons of Ash, near Canterbury, and in a case designed by Caroe & Partners, is installed in the north wall of the chancel, where it further occupies a small extension built for the purpose. Adjacent to the organ are a pulpit and, on both sides of the chancel, choir stalls. Seating for the congregation is provided by pews along both sides of the nave: when new, the church's capacity was given as 150. The church is surrounded by a graveyard, at the northern edge of which a war memorial stands facing into the adjacent Reculver Lane. Set up in 1919, it records the names of 27 parishioners who died fighting in the First World War and the Second World War. Present use Baptismal font in the Church of St Mary the Virgin in 2015: the font is probably from All Saints' Church, Shuart. It is shown here containing water previously used in a baptism. The Church of St Mary the Virgin, Reculver, remains in use as an Anglican church within the diocese of Canterbury, the archdeaconry of Canterbury and the deanery of Reculver. Its benefice is united with those of St Bartholomew, Herne Bay, and Holy Cross, Hoath. Until 1960, the pastoral care of Hoath had depended on the parish of Reculver since the Middle Ages.

United States, 578 U.S. ___ (2016), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court clarified whether the Hobbs Act's definition of conspiracy to commit extortion only includes attempts to acquire property from someone who is not a member of the conspiracy., slip op. at 1, 5, 18 (2016). The case arose when Samuel Ocasio, a former Baltimore, Maryland police officer, was indicted for participating in a kickback scheme with an automobile repair shop where officers would refer drivers of damaged vehicles to the shop in exchange for cash payments.Ocasio, slip op. at 2. Ocasio argued that he should not be found guilty of conspiring to commit extortion because the only property that was exchanged in the scheme was transferred from one member of the conspiracy to another, and an individual cannot be found guilty of conspiring to extort a co-conspirator.Ocasio, slip op. at 3. 11‚Äì14. Writing for a majority of the Court, Justice Samuel Alito held that a conspiracy to violate the Hobbs Act can occur when an individual obtains property from another conspirator under the pretense that they have an official right to take that property.Ocasio, slip op. at 1, 18. Justice Stephen Breyer wrote a separate concurring opinion in which he suggested that the Court may need to revisit prior cases that have held that \\"extortion\\" is roughly equivalent to \\"bribery\\".Ocasio, slip op. at 1‚Äì2 (Breyer, J., concurring) (noting that he \\"\\"join[ed] the majority‚Äôs opinion in full.\\"). Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a dissenting opinion in which he also argued that the Court should overturn a line of cases that has conflated the definition of extortion with bribery, and he also argued that the majority's opinion was inconsistent with principles of federalism.Ocasio, slip op. at 1, 3‚Äì6 (Thomas, J., dissenting). Justice Sonia Sotomayor also wrote a dissenting opinion in which she argued that the majority's opinion was inconsistent with the plain language of the Hobbs Act as well as the Court's prior conspiracy law jurisprudence.Ocasio, slip op. at 1, 11 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting). Although some commentators have stated that the case is consistent with prior precedent,See, e.g., Randall Eliason, Response, The Contortionist Extortionist: Response to United States v. Ocasio, (May 10, 2016). at least one commentator has suggested that the case will \\"raise more questions than answers.\\"Rory Little, Opinion analysis: Federal conspiracy law reaches persons who agree to obtain secret kickbacks from a member of the conspiracy, (May 2, 2016) (internal quotations omitted). Background Between 2008 and 2011, at least 60 Baltimore, Maryland police officers engaged in a kickback scheme with an automobile repair shop.Ocasio, slip op. at 1‚Äì2. When these officers responded to traffic accidents, they would refer motorists to the repair shop in exchange for payments of $150 to $300 for every referral. Samuel Ocasio was a former Baltimore police officer who participated in this scheme between 2009 and 2011. He was charged under the Hobbs Act. for extorting money from the automobile repair shop. Before his trial began, Ocasio sought a jury instruction that would have required the jury to find, as a prerequisite for convicting him for conspiracy to commit extortion, that \\"the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the conspiracy was to obtain money or property from some person who was not a member of the conspiracy\\".Ocasio, slip op. at 3 (internal quotations omitted) (noting that Ocasio based his request on the Sixth Circuit's ruling in United States v. Brock, 501 F.3d 762 (6th Cir. 2007)). The United States District Court for the District of Maryland ultimately refused to provide Ocasio's proposed instruction and Ocasio was found guilty on one count of conspiracy and three counts of extortion.Ocasio, slip op. at 4 (noting that \\"[t]he District Court denied [Ocasio's] motions, concluding that the Fourth Circuit had already rejected Brock‚Äôs holding in United States v. Spitler, 800 F.2d 1267 (4th Cir. 1986)). On appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, Ocasio argued that \\"his conspiracy conviction was fatally flawed because the conspirators had not agreed to obtain money from a person who was not a member of the conspiracy\\", but the Fourth Circuit affirmed his conviction.Ocasio, slip op. at 4 (citing United States v. Ocasio, 750 F.3d 399 (4th Cir. 2014)). Ocasio appealed again, and on March 2, 2015, the Supreme Court of the United States granted certiorari.Ocasio v. United States, 574 U.S. ___ (2015) (granting certiorari). Opinion of the Court In his majority opinion, Justice Samuel Alito (pictured) held that it was sufficient for the government to demonstrate that at least one member of the conspiracy intended to commit extortion.Ocasio, slip op. at 10. Writing for a majority of the Court, Justice Samuel Alito held that to be found guilty of conspiracy, a \\"defendant must merely reach an agreement with the 'specific intent that the underlying crime be committed' by some member of the conspiracy\\".Ocasio, slip op. at 5 (quoting 2 K. O‚ÄôMalley, J. Grenig, & W. Lee, ¬ß31:03, p. 225 (6th ed. 2008)) (emphasis in original). He concluded that it was sufficient for the government to demonstrate that each conspirator \\"specifically intended that some conspirator commit each element of the substantive offense\\".Ocasio, slip op. at 10 (emphasis in original). Additionally, Justice Alito rejected Ocasio's argument that the conspiracy conviction should be reversed because Ocasio and the auto shop were simply exchanging \\"their own\\" money; instead, Justice Alito held that the convictions were justified because other Baltimore police officers were involved in the underlying substantive violations.Ocasio, slip op. at 11‚Äì14. Justice Alito also rejected Ocasio's argument that the Court's \\"interpretation makes the Hobbs Act sweep too broadly, creating a national antibribery law and displacing a carefully crafted network of state and federal statutes\\".Ocasio, slip op. at 14‚Äì16. In Evans v. United States,Evans v. United States, . the Court had explained that an act of extortion under the Hobbs act was the \\"rough equivalent\\" of bribery.Ocasio, slip op. at 14. Because Ocasio did not ask the court to overrule Evans and because the Court had \\"no occasion to do so\\" sua sponte, Justice Alito held that \\"we have no principled basis for precluding the prosecution of conspiracies to commit\\" extortion under the Hobbs act. Justice Alito also rejected the argument that the Court's ruling would \\"transform every bribe of a public official into a conspiracy to commit extortion\\" because \\"[i]n cases where the bribe payor is merely complying with an official demand, the payor lacks the mens rea necessary for a conspiracy\\".Ocasio, slip op. at 16. Consequently, because Ocasio entered into an agreement to extort money \\"under color of official right\\", the Court affirmed Ocasio's conviction.Ocasio, slip op. at 18. =Justice Breyer's concurring opinion= Although he \\"join[ed] the majority‚Äôs opinion in full\\", Justice Stephen Breyer wrote a separate concurring opinion to explain that Evans v. United States \\"may well have been wrongly decided\\".Ocasio, slip op. at 1‚Äì2 (Breyer, J., concurring). Justice Breyer wrote that \\"[t]he present case underscores some of the problems that Evans raises\\", but he ultimately agreed with the majority's conclusion because \\"we must in this case take Evans as good law\\".Ocasio, slip op. at 2 (Breyer, J., concurring). However, Justice Breyer argued that \\"it is an exceptionally difficult question\\" whether the Hobbs Act's definition of extortion was equivalent to bribery.Ocasio, slip op. at 1 (Breyer, J., concurring). =Justice Thomas' dissenting opinion= Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a dissenting opinion in which he argued that Ocasio's conviction should be reversed because \\"an extortionist cannot conspire to commit extortion with the person whom he is extorting\\".Ocasio, slip op. at 6 (Thomas, J., dissenting). He stated that the majority opinion \\"further exposes the flaw in this Court‚Äôs understanding of extortion\\".Ocasio, slip op. at 1 (Thomas, J., dissenting). Justice Thomas argued that this misunderstanding originated in the Court's prior opinion in Evans v. United States, which, according to Justice Thomas, \\"wrongly equated extortion with bribery\\". In Evans, Justice Thomas wrote a dissenting opinion in which he argued that under the Hobbs Act, \\"the only perpetrator is the public official; the payor is a victim and not a participant\\".Ocasio, slip op. at 3 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (citing Evans, 504 U.S. at 283 (Thomas, J., dissenting). Relying upon this principle, Justice Thomas reiterated that it is not possible for an extortionist and \\"his payor- victim can be co-conspirators to extortion of the payor\\".Ocasio, slip op. at 3 (Thomas, J., dissenting). Justice Thomas criticized the majority for taking \\"another step away from the common-law understanding of extortion that the Hobbs Act adopted\\", and argued that \\"[o]nly by blurring the distinction between bribery and extortion could Evans make it seem plausible that an extortionist and a victim can conspire to extort the victim\\".Ocasio, slip op. at 3‚Äì4 (Thomas, J., dissenting). Justice Thomas also criticized the majority for expanding federal criminal law in a manner that he argued was inconsistent with the principles of [federalism.Ocasio, slip op. at 4‚Äì6 (Thomas, J., dissenting). He characterized the Hobbs Act as an example of the \\"stunning expansion\\" into the area of anti-corruption laws, which he argued were \\"traditionally policed by state and local laws\\".Ocasio, slip op. at 3 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (citing Evans, 504 U.S. at 290 (Thomas, J., dissenting)). Additionally, Justice Thomas stated that the authors of the Hobbs Act did not intend to enable the regulation of state officials by federal prosecutors, and he characterized the expansion of the Hobbs act as an \\"invasion of state sovereignty\\".Ocasio, slip op. at 4‚Äì5 (Thomas, J., dissenting). He wrote, \\"as in Evans, the Court reaches its decision with barely a nod to the sovereignty interests that it tramples\\".Ocasio, slip op. at 5 (Thomas, J., dissenting). For those reasons, Justice Thomas dissented from the Court's majority opinion. =Justice Sotomayor's dissenting opinion= Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a dissenting opinion in which she was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts.Ocasio, slip op. at 1 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting). She criticized the majority's conclusion as \\"not a natural or logical way to interpret\\" the Hobbs Act's definition of extortion, which requires property to be extorted \\"from another\\".Ocasio, slip op. at 1 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (\\"If a group of conspirators sets out to extort 'another' person, we ordinarily think that they are proposing to extort money or property from a victim outside their group, not one of themselves.\\"). Citing dictionary definitions of the word \\"another\\" and the Court's prior conspiracy law jurisprudence, Justice Sotomayor argued that an individual should only be found guilty of conspiring to commit extortion when they plan to extort an individual who is not a member of the conspiracy.Ocasio, slip op. at 3‚Äì6 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) Likewise, she also distinguished other cases in which criminal defendants were also the \\"victim[s] of the crime\\" in those cases.Ocasio, slip op. at 6‚Äì11 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting). Justice Sotomayor ultimately concluded her opinion by stating that the majority reached \\"an unnatural outcome predicated on an unsupported assumption\\".Ocasio, slip op. at 11 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting). Commentary and analysis In his analysis for The George Washington Law Review, Randall Eliason wrote that the Court's decision \\"doesn‚Äôt represent some new watershed in white collar crime or dramatic expansion of federal criminal jurisdiction\\", but rather, that the Court's ruling was \\"simply the logical and unfortunate outgrowth of a questionable Supreme Court decision more than three decades old.\\"Randall Eliason, Response, The Contortionist Extortionist: Response to United States v. Ocasio, (May 10, 2016). Additionally, in his review of the Court's opinion for SCOTUSblog, Rory Little wrote that the majority's opinion \\"does not seem wrong as a matter of case-specific practical reality\\" but that the case may \\"raise more questions than answers for future federal official right extortion prosecutions.\\" Jonathan H. Adler also characterized the Court's ruling as one of several cases released in early 2016, including Luis v. United States and Bank Markazi v. Peterson, that \\"produced some particularly interesting divisions among the justices\\".Jonathan H. Adler, Today‚Äôs interesting Supreme Court lineup (May 2, 2016).

For this purpose the Mission provides bilingual education in the early years, both in the native language and Portuguese, and then continues solely in Portuguese. The Mission also works in the area of health where, together with the government organization SUS, it provides a hospital exclusively for the indigenous population. The Porta da Esperanca Hospital and Maternity were founded in March 1963, and a Tuberculosis Ward was added in 1980. The hospital also provides pediatric treatment for undernourished children. Working within the Ministry of Health, the hospital has increased its service to include tribes throughout Brazil.

Comic art is a form of visual expression defined by sequences of juxtaposed panels containing stylised images with bold outlines which incorporate text or symbols as an integral part of the narrative. Introduced by members of the British colonial elite, who were also amateur artists, cartooning and comic art was embraced by Burmese artists as a new mode of visual and critical expression. First appearing in the early 1910s, within two decades comics and cartoons emerged as a significant vehicle by which political and social criticism could be made within Burma's restricted public arena.Aung Soe Min, ‚ÄúComic Culture in Myanmar: When Lines Shine a Light in the Darkness,‚Äù Goethe Institut, accessed April 30, 2016, https://www.goethe.de/ins/mm/en/kul/mag/20697882.html. As the number of print publications in Burma grew, from 22 in 1911 to 103 in 1921 and finally to over 200 by the close of the 1930s, comics became a substantial avenue for entertainment, art and discourse.John A Lent, Asian Comics (Jackson: University Press of Mississippi, 2015), 177.  Origins and influences  The first cartoon published in Burma appeared in the Rangoon Times in 1912.Ibid, 175. The cartoon was created by Martin Jones, the British commissioner of Burma's railways. It depicted a young Burmese woman who attended a Western party and was subsequently humiliated.Aung Zaw, ‚ÄúPioneers of Burmese Cartooning,‚Äù Irrawaddy 11, no. 7 (2003), accessed April 30, 2016, http://www2.irrawaddy.com/article.php?art_id=3069&page;=1. Jones published the derogatory illustration under the pseudonym Myauk, the derivation of the Burmese term myauk phyu meaning ‚Äòwhite monkey‚Äô.Lent, Asian Comics, 175. A term the Burmese used to refer to the British colonial forces who occupied Burma from 1824 to 1948.Virginia Thompson, ‚ÄúBurma,‚Äù in South East Asia: Colonial History - Vol IV, ed. Paul H Kratoska (London: Routledge, 2001), 81. Jones along with fellow amateur colonial painters physics professor Kenneth Ward and principal of St. Mathews High School in Moulmien E G N Kinch founded the Burma Art Club in 1913.Aung Zaw, ‚ÄúBurmese Cartooning‚Äù; Andrew Ranard, Burmese Painting: A Linear and Lateral History (Chiang Mai: Silkworm Publications, 2009), 91; cf Lent, Asian Comics, 175, Lent suggests that the Burma Art Club was established in 1917. This may be a confusion surrounding the date of the Club‚Äôs founding which occurred in 1913 and its formalisation which followed in 1918. Their efforts were assisted by Commissioner Hla Aung and his partner Mya May, along with several young Burmese artists including Ba Zaw, Ba Nyan, Tha Dun, Tun Hla, and Ba Kyi.Ranard, Burmese Painting, 91-2; Lent, Asian Comics, 175. Located on the grounds of the Rangoon Government High School,Irene Moilanen and Sergeƒ≠ Sergeevich Ozhegov, Mirrored in Wood: Burmese Art and Architecture (Bangkok: White Lotus Press, 1999), 162. the Burma Art Club was a colonial art institution with the objective of promoting Western-style painting and drawing, including cartooning, to select Burmese students.Ranard, Burmese Painting, 92-3. It has been suggested by art historian Andrew Ranard that: Among the first initiates to receive training from the establishment were the now notable Burmese cartoonists Ba Gale, also known as Shwe Talay or Shwe Yoe, and Ba Gyan.Lent, Asian Comics, 175. It is considered that the beginning of Burma's comic art movement was defined by these individuals.John A Lent, ‚ÄúCartooning in Southeast Asia,‚Äù in Encyclopedia of Humour Studies, ed. Salvatore Attardo (Thousand Oaks: Sage Publications, 2014), 725.  Ba Gale  Ba Gale (1893-1945) was a formative figure in Burma's burgeoning comic art scene. His career began in 1915, after publishing a cartoon in the Rangoon College Annual Magazine at the age of 22.Aung Zaw, ‚ÄúBurmese Cartooning‚Äù; Myo Thant, ‚ÄúSocial Critics, Satirists and Humourists‚Äù (paper presented at the National Workshop on Copyright: Myanmar‚Äôs Gateway to IP, Yangon, September 7, 2005), accessed April 30, 2016, http://www.accu.or.jp/appreb/02/02-02/02-02country/previous/prev_mm.html. Crucially, he was the first artist to draw and publish a cartoon in the Burmese language, which appeared in Thuriya, a publication run by young nationalists, in March 1917.Lent, Asian Comics, 175. Earning 10-15 kyat per cartoon (approximately AU $0.17) Ba Gale sought to make cartooning his career.Aung Zaw, ‚ÄúBurmese Cartooning‚Äù. His works subsequently appeared in the Rangoon Times and as part of the editorial pages in other smaller local newspapers.Ibid. Ba Gale, Shwedagon shoe controversy comic, c. 1917 Ba Gale's style drew heavily from the European tradition of caricature. During his time at the Burma Art Club, he was introduced to and subscribed to the British comic publication Punch, known for its political and social satire.Ranard, Burmese Painting, 92. Despite being acknowledged as an adept artist and an astute pictorial commentator, the Burmese public initially found it difficult to understand and interpret Ba Gale's exaggerated and stylised drawing style.Aung Zaw, ‚ÄúBurmese Cartooning‚Äù; Lent, Asian Comics, 175; This would seem to contradict Ranard‚Äôs assertion that elements of caricature could be identified in early Burmese temple paintings making the style familiar. Perhaps the similarities were clearer for individuals with an artist training and background, such as the students of the Burma Art Club as opposed to the general Burmese population. Writer and social historian Aung Zaw notes that: Even in its earliest stages, Burmese comic art was political. Despite being a regular fixture within the English-language periodicals that circulated throughout Burma, Ba Gale's works often parodied the British administration.Lent, Asian Comics, 176; Aung Zaw, ‚ÄúBurmese Cartooning‚Äù; Aung Soe Min, ‚ÄúComic Culture in Myanmar‚Äù. However, he did not limit his critique to the colonialists. He also used comic art to critic prominent social issues such as opportunistic politicians and what he perceived as sycophantic behaviour towards the British.Lent, Asian Comics, 176; Aung Soe Min, ‚ÄúComic Culture in Myanmar‚Äù. Considered one of Ba Gale's most famous cartoons is his portrayal of the 1917 resolution to forbid colonial forces from wearing shoes within the Shwedagon Pagoda; an act which was forbidden by Burmese religious custom.Elizabeth Moore, Hansj√∂rg Mayer and U Win Pe, Shwedagon: Golden Pagoda of Myanmar (Bangkok: River Books, 1999), 150. Ba Gale illustrated the portly colonialists, identified by their opulent Western dress, riding on the back of Burmese people like horses so that they did not have to obey the custom of removing their shoes within the Shwedagon. Ba Gale does not just lampoon the British and their disrespectful behaviour he also questions the attitudes of those Burmese people who assist them.Aung Zaw, ‚ÄúBurmese Cartooning‚Äù; Aung Soe Min, ‚ÄúComic Culture in Myanmar‚Äù; Donald Seekins, Historical Dictionary of Burma (Myanmar) (Maryland: Scarecrow Press Inc, 2006), 136. Ba Gale, however, did not escape criticism entirely. A cartoon which depicted the leader of a 1930 peasant uprising as a hero earned him substantial condemnation from British officials, though he was never jailed.Lent, Asian Comics, 176; Aung Zaw notes the leniency which cartoonists enjoyed under British rule, particularly when compared with the censorship imposed by the subsequent military juntas that ruled Burma from 1962 until 2010. He considers that this relative freedom was an important aspect in the initial development of a Burmese comic art. Towards the mid-1920s Ba Gale transitioned into filmmaking and acting where he gained significant popularity.  Ba Gyan  The political inclination first seen in Ba Gale's work was furthered by his contemporary Ba Gyan (1902-1953) who rose to prominence in the 1930s with his bold cartoons and nationalist agenda.Bertil Littner, ‚ÄúAvoiding the Draft,‚Äù Far Eastern Economic Review 148, vol. 3 (1991): 32. Ba Gyan, like Ba Gale, also trained at the Burma Art Club where he was singled-out by founder Martin Jones for his ‚Äòtalent, humour and desire to entertain.‚ÄôAung Zaw, ‚ÄúBurmese Cartooning‚Äù; see also Ranard, Burmese Painting, 92. Ba Gyan's practice traversed a number of fields. In addition to working as an editorial cartoonist, he also illustrated children's magazines, worked as a commercial photographer, novelist and animator.Lent, Asian Comics, 176. Ba Gyan was instrumental in establishing the Burmese animation industry. In 1934 and 1935 he produced Burma's first animated films, Kye Taungwa and Athuya respectively.Ibid, 177. Previously, Burmese comic art had been restricted to single cartons or limited panel short stories, however, in 1937 Ba Gyan created Burma's first comic book, Ko Pyoo and Ma Pyone.Myo Thant, ‚ÄúSocial Critics‚Äù. At this stage Ba Gyan also began to work with recurring characters whose antics would be developed and explored across the political and humour panels of several major publications.Lent, Asian Comics, 177. Ba Gyan, Tatmadaw (Armed Forces) political comic, first published 1952. Text running upper centre to centre right translates to, '1952 - The plan to not split the people and the Armed Forces'. After Burma gained its independence in 1948, Ba Gyan's comic production became explicitly political and highly critical.Seekins, Historical Dictionary of Burma, 136. Of particular significance was a cartoon which appeared in a local newspaper on January 4, 1948. The comic depicted British General Sir Hubert Rance departing Burma, waving goodbye to a local family as he tells them ‚ÄòTake care of your children.‚ÄôAung Soe Min, ‚ÄúComic Culture in Myanmar‚Äù. Behind the amicable scene are three children each symbolising a damage caused by the Second World War: debt, destruction and economic crisis.Ibid. Ba Gyan's use of metaphor as a communicative device shows a growing sophistication and maturing in Burma's comic art movement. Gallerist and collector Aung Soe Min claims that the cartoon's popularity stemmed from its ability to concisely express Burma's situation at the time.Ibid. Post-independence Ba Gyan took a firmly partisan stance satirising both sides of Burma's new political regime; lampooning the Prime Minister U Nu and the opposing communist leader Thakin Than Tun.Aung Zaw, ‚ÄúBurmese Cartooning‚Äù. Aung Zaw notes that Ba Gyan's influence was respected and recognised by these figures. By the early 1950s Burma was embroiled in political turmoil and on the cusp of a civil war, in a bid to quell a social uprising Prime Minister U Nu sought a meeting with Ba Gyan asking him to only exhibit cartoons which exhibited peace and unity.Ibid. Famously, he refused to compromise informing U Nu that he was too busy to attend the meeting.Ibid. Ba Gyan, and other early cartoonists such as Hein Sung, viewed their role as ‚Äòpublic watchdog‚Äôs‚Äô who were responsible for keeping the Burma's independent power structures in check.Littner, ‚ÄúAvoiding the Draft,‚Äù 32.  Post-independence Onwards  The proceeding period of development in Burma's comic art which spanned from the early 1950s until the military takeover of 1962 was an era of growth and experimentation in which younger artists expanded on the visual tradition established by Ba Gale and Ba Gyan.Myo Thant, ‚ÄúSocial Critics‚Äù. Without the competition of television, periodicals inundated with comics became one of the major sources of entertainment particularly for the younger generation.Lent, Asian Comics, 177. However, following the 1962 coup by the socialist, military leader Ne Win, Burma's comic art with its fundamental political basis languished under the strictures of the junta.Seekins, Historical Dictionary of Burma, 136. Comic art stagnated until the 1970s when developments in the book publishing industry helped to revive the practice.Myo Thant, ‚ÄúSocial Critics‚Äù; Tin Maung Muang Than, ‚ÄúThe Media in Myanmar,‚Äù in Media Fortunes, Changing Times: ASEAN States in Transition, ed.

They contain information on the physical condition of the exiles from Israel and their financial condition in Babylon. The tablets are named after the central settlement mentioned in the documents, al-Yahudu (Akkadian: The city of Judah). The earliest document in the collection dates back to 572 BCE, about 15 years after the destruction of the Temple, during the reign of Nebuchadnezzar II. The most recent tablet dates back to 477 BCE, during the reign of Xerxes I, about 60 years after the Return to Zion began and about 20 years before the rise of Ezra the Scribe. Discovery and research The public records do not contain information on the location and date of the discovery of the documents in Iraq, and it seems that they were not found in an archaeological excavation. The first time the public was exposed to the documents and the settlement of al-Yahudu was in an article by two French researchers in 1999, which dealt with three legal documents of Jews in Babylon, including the city of al-Yahudu itself. These three certificates were part of a small collection of six documents in the possession of Israeli antiquities collector Shlomo Moussaieff. At the beginning of the 21st century, it turned out that this was not a small collection, but a collection of more than 200 documents, most of which were in two other private collections. Some of the documents were presented in 2004 at Beth Hatefutsoth in Tel Aviv and were investigated in part by Kathleen Abraham of Bar-Ilan University. Since then, the entire collection has been investigated mainly by two researchers - Cornelia Wunsch of Germany and Laurie Pearce of the United States. After a series of papers on documentary issues, Wensh and Pierce published in early 2015 the first full translations and analysis of the collection in the author's book. Geography Although no information was given on the circumstances of the discovery of the documents, the plan provides clues as to the location of the communities mentioned in the Jewish exiles. The assessment is based on two main components: * The mention of familiar sites, such as cities that have been excavated and researched, or concepts that have been evaluated for their location. * Cross-referencing the names of the few writers mentioned in the documents vis-√†-vis the communities mentioned in them and the date of writing the documents. In some cases, this cross-cross has made it possible to estimate the distance between a recognized locality and an unrecognized locality. Based on this, researchers estimate that al-Yahudu and the other communities mentioned in the documents are located in the area southeast of the city of Nippur. =The localities mentioned in the documents= Beyond the settlement of al-Yahudu, other settlements were mentioned where Jews were living or working. Some of them are well-known cities and some were apparently satellite settlements of al-Yahudu. The main localities mentioned in the documents are: * Al-Yahudu: The dominant settlement in the documents. The most ancient document in the collection, dated 572 BCE, is called Al-Yahudiyya (\\"City of the Jews\\"). * Beit Nashar: Apparently not far from al-Yahudu. A mixed community, where Jews also lived. The ruler of the settlement, which appears in many of the documents, was Ahikar ben Riemot, who was probably Jewish in origin. * House of Aviram: Possibly named after Abraham. Although this locality is located in connection with al-Yahudu, there were no Jews with Jewish names and it is unclear whether Jews lived there. The most famous figure in this locality is Zbava Sher-Ozer, an heir to the Babylonian throne. * The village of Ubu Sha Tubiyama: Possibly named after the village's founder, Tuviyahu ben Mukhaiahu. * Al-Hazatu: A community of Gazan exiles. The collection also contains documents from the cities of Babylon, Nippur, Borsippa, and even a document signed on the banks of the Kebar River, known in the bible as the site of the Exile and known from the Babylonian records as an irrigation canal which was also used as a transportation channel for commerce and movement of people. The collection contained no references to other biblical-known cities in which the Babylonian exiles resided. Life of Jews in Babylon as reflected in the documents The al-Yahudu tablets cover a period of 100 years under Babylonian rule, especially Persian. In general, the documents show a similarity between the life of the Jews and other exiles in the kingdom at the time. In principle, it can be said that the documents attest to the tension between the preservation of Jewish identity, language, culture and religion and the need, and sometimes the will, to integrate into life in Babylon. In this respect, life in Babylon corresponds to the instruction of the prophet Jeremiah in a letter he sent from Judah to the Babylonian exiles following the exile of Jeconiah in 597 BCE. =Status of exiles= According to the documents, the Jews were defined as \\"Shushanu\\". This status is also known from other documents from the period and relates to foreign exiles who were exiled to Babylon, mainly in order to rehabilitate cities and areas devastated by past wars. These exiles received land lease for their livelihood in the form of service in exchange for land. Although they can be compared to the status of land-bound tenants, they seem to have enjoyed freedom of movement, they were defined as independent entities before the Babylonian and Persian law and enjoyed the possibilities of social and economic integration. =Service for the Kingdom= The type of service required of the exiles is mentioned in the documents, both in the context of the designation of the leasehold lands and directly in the jobs that the exiles were required to perform as part of the payment of taxes. Based on other documents dealing with payment of tax and service to the kingdom after their settlement, it seems that other exiles were employed in physical labor. These included construction work, excavation and maintenance of irrigation channels. It is possible that among these were many of the \\"plow and locksmith\\", mentioned in connection with the exile of Jeconiah in 597 BCE. The nature of the service described also appears to indicate a restriction imposed on them in their movement, and to a certain extent may have been in this period a status similar to that of a slave. This period may be reflected in the famous lines from Psalms 137 on the exile. Most of the Jews on the certificates made their living from agriculture. Most of the land they leased grew dates and barley, but wheat, spices and linen were also mentioned in the documents. Analysis of the money amounts in the transactions appearing in the certificates shows that they had a low economic status relative to the kingdom. A comparison of the economic agreements from other collections in Babylon indicates the integration of the Jews into the economic life of Babylon, and it seems that they operated on the daily economic level, like other Babylonians, and not necessarily according to the laws of the Torah. =Social and economic integration= Among the exiles, there are documents of a number of Jews of strong economic standing. Some (such as Raphaiah Ben Smachiho and his son) acted as intermediaries and credit providers to the Jewish population and managed to accumulate substantial capital. These intermediaries provided pure silver coins to concentrate tax payments of various Jews and provided farmers with means of production, such as plowing animals and grain. =Jewish lifestyle and attitude toward Zion= Due to the nature of the documents, this subject appears only implicitly. The preservation of Jewish identity can be seen in the sequence of names given to family members for at least four generations, the fact that no documents were found on Jewish holidays, and that dates were not signed on Shabbat. The documents do not show signs of people leaving for Judea, but at least two Jews have been found who had a desire to return to Zion: * A man named Siddur, apparently given his name in the hope of returning to the Holy Land. * A man named Yaeli, who points to his parents' desire that he immigrate to Israel. This refers to the concept of \\"Yael,\\" which is contained in the Cyrus Cylinder of 538 BCE, and refers to the immigration of exiles to Israel. =Babylonized naming conventions= The Al-Yahudu Tablets provide among the first Babylonian transcriptions of Israelite names. Earlier, the Assyrians, whom the Babylonians had usurped, had made several inscriptions which featured names of Israelite provenance, including Omri,James B.

A daughter chapel was built in 1873 that had Welsh-language services, while the original church used English and was known as the Lower Baptist Chapel Abercarn. The chapel's pastor, Rev. Probert, led the local response to the Abercarn colliery disaster in 1878. The chapel was extensively remodelled beginning in 1882 that included levelling the ground floor, the insertion of galleries, a new pulpit and seating and the addition of a harmonium. A new external vestibule was also added; the total cost coming to ¬£1,050. The addition of a pipe organ in 1917 by J.J. Binns required further modifications to the front of the building.

He earned the nickname the Butcher of Fallujah within US military and intelligence circles after he allegedly masterminded the ambush and killing of four American military contractors whose bodies were then dragged by a spontaneously formed mob and hung from the old bridge over the Euphrates river in Fallujah, Iraq. In September 2009, a team of U.S. Navy SEALs captured al-Isawi in a nighttime raid in Fallujah, and he was charged with orchestrating the slayings. He was held for a time by the United States intelligence community and accused some of the SEALs who captured him of mistreating him while detained at Camp Schwedler. al-Isawi was subsequently handed over to Iraqi authorities and was awaiting his own trial when he testified at one of the resulting 2010 courts-martial. His own trial was held some time before November 2013, and al-Isawi was executed by hanging for the killings.  Alleged Role in 2004 Fallujah Ambush  On March 31, 2004, Iraqi insurgents ambushed a convoy assigned to protect food caterers ESS who were supplying US military bases near Fallujah. Four armed private contractors working as security guards for Blackwater USA - Scott Helvenston, Jerko Zovko, Wesley Batalona, and Michael Teague - were killed by machine gun fire and a grenade thrown through a window of their SUVs. Their bodies were dragged from the burning wreckage of their vehicles, mutilated, and dragged through the streets by a spontaneous mob largely composed of teenagers and boys. Two of the bodies were hung on display from a bridge over the Euphrates river as the crowd celebrated below. Images of the gruesome aftermath were filmed by the international news media, drawing attention to issues around private contractors and prompting Operation Vigilant Resolve, which evolved into the first Battle of Fallujah. Their bodies were recovered near the outskirts of Baghdad early in April. Abu Musab al-Zarqawi was originally suspected as the organiser of the ambush as he was known to planning terror attacks and believed to be in the area. The intelligence community was doubtful, however, because the exhibitionism of broadcasting images of the desecration of the victim's bodies was uncharacteristic of al-Zarqawi, whose typical style was to leak to Al Jazeera that he had planned an attack some weeks after it occurred. Based on intelligence reports, U.S. authorities eventually accused Ahmad Hashim Abd al-Isawi of masterminding the ambush, and he was charged with the deaths upon his capture. The brutality of the ambush and desecration of the victim's remains earned al-Isawi the nickname the \\"Butcher of Fallujah,\\" however only within US military and intelligence circles and not among the people of Fallujah, most of whom supported the insurgency to remove the US military occupation from their country. The Blackwater killings marked the start of Ahmad Hashim's supposed rivalry with al-Zarqawi and his \\"blood-soaked journey to the peak of al-Qaeda command.\\" Patrick Robinson's book about al- Isawi's capture described him as having \\"personally started on the rubble- strewn streets the worst close-combat fighting of the entire war,\\" creating in Fallujah the \\"most violent area in all of Iraq ... [where] the demented Sunni killer Al-Isawi had assumed a loose and terrifying control.\\" In September 2004, al-Zarqawi was the \\"highest priority\\" target in Fallujah for the United States military; he died in a targeted killing in June 2006 when a United States Air Force jet dropped two 500-pound (230 kg) guided bombs on the safehouse in which he was attending a meeting. al-Isawi replaced him as a key target, a briefing from a commander of SEAL Team 4 stating \\"Gentlemen, for us there's nothing so difficult as searching for the unknown. But right now, the way it's been for God knows how long, we have only a name for this bastard Isawi. There's no more doubt that he strung up the bodies on the bridge, matter of fact he seems proud of that. But we've never been able even to see the sonofabitch. Right now we don't even have a friggin' photograph.\\"  Capture  Five years after the ambush, in September 2009, a Navy SEAL team raided a house in search of al-Isawi, who was at that time both a high-value target for intelligence gathering and the most wanted terrorist in Iraq. Special Warfare Operator, Second Class Matthew McCabe located and confronted a man matching al-Isawi's description, who was reaching for a gun. Following orders to capture al-Isawi if possible, and at personal risk, McCabe subdued al-Isawi and he was taken into custody in what was initially reported as a \\"textbook\\" operation. = Abuse allegations = Following his incarceration at Camp Schwedler, al-Isawi alleged, with blood on his lip and shirt, that he had suffered abuse as a detainee. According to U.S. authorities, a jihadist manual discovered in 2000 instructs captured operatives to immediately claim to have been mistreated. Petty officer third class MA3 Kevin DeMartino who had responsibility for supervising al-Isawi, and had left him unsupervised in violation of procedures, offered corroboration that McCabe had struck al-Isawi in the stomach while other SEALs failed to intervene. Members of the SEAL team were interrogated and encouraged to confess to misdeeds in return for receiving non-judicial punishment, which they refused and exercised their right to demand to face a court-martial. McCabe, Jonathan Keefe, and Julio Huertas ultimately faced courts-martial on charges including assault (McCabe only), making a false official statement, and dereliction of performance of duty for willfully failing to safeguard a detainee. = Courts-Martial = SEAL Team members offered testimony on the character of the SEALs and what they had witnessed. This included Carl Higbie, who participated in the capture of al-Isawi and has written two books about the raid and its aftermath. Dozens of Republican lawmakers wrote to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, President Barack Obama, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Michael Mullen seeking their intervention; Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA) called for the Pentagon to drop all charges against the SEALs, a call echoed by groups like Move America Forward and in conservative media. Dan Burton (R-IN) was willing to testify for McCabe about the public support for the SEALs and the outrage at them being tried. Claims were made of unlawful command influence, alleging that Major General Charles Cleveland had been inappropriately influenced as the convening authority to proceed to court-martial rather than to dismiss the trial. These were dismissed at the McCabe court-martial, but the belief that decisions were driven by the shadow of Abu Ghraib persists in some quarters. Colonel Dwight Sullivan, USMCR, was the Chief Defense Counsel for the United States for the Guantanamo military commission from 2005 to 2007 and attended the court-martial; he recorded his observations and analysis at his CAAFlog site. Evidence presented in the McCabe court martial can be divided into four broad categories: video testimony from al-Isawi as the alleged victim, direct testimony from DeMartino regarding the alleged assault, testimony and character evidence from SEAL team members and other witnesses, and medical evidence. al-Isawi's recorded testimony was played for the court first, in which he alleged that \\"while handcuffed and blindfolded, he was kicked in the abdomen and fell to the floor ... [and] then kicked several more times while on the floor.\\" During the video playback, the defence used an easel to present what it described as inconsistencies in al-Isawis testimony. Evidence was then submitted of al-Isawis suspected involvement in the Fallujah killings, and testimony presented that he was \\"believed to have killed hundreds of Iraqis\\" and earned the nickname \\"The Finisher\\" amongst Iraqis, for his reputedly having \\"the decapitated bodies of his victims delivered to their families' doorsteps.\\" The detachment officer-in-charge, the direct commander of both McCabe and DeMartino, testified for the government under a grant of immunity that he observed blood on al-Isawi's lip. Under cross-examination by the defense, he suggested that al-Isawi was \\"hamming it up\\" and faking injuries, and said the detainee \\"sucked on the sore in his mouth to mix blood in with his saliva and spit it out after he heard Iraqi voices\\"; an oral surgeon confirmed that the blood may have come from biting a mouth ulcer. At the Huertas court-martial, photographs of al-Isawi's \\"face and body taken in the days immediately after the alleged attack\\" were presented in evidence, and showed \\"a visible cut inside his lip but no obvious signs of bruising or injuries anywhere else.\\" Consequently, with the claim of repeated kicks unsupported by physical evidence and the testimony that the bleeding lip may have been self-inflicted, both the defense and some subsequent commentary argued that al-Isawi was following the directions in the al-Qaeda manual to claim mistreatment. Following his capture, al-Isawi was to be handed over to Iraqi authorities but they were unable to accept custody until the following morning, forcing his detention in Camp Schwedler, which lacked a proper detention facility. DeMartino took responsibility for al-Isawi despite the second master-at-arms having being transferred back to the United States, and admitted during direct testimony that he was consequently in dereliction of duty both in accepting the prisoner and in leaving him unattended. According to Fox News, DeMartino's account of subsequent events and conversations was contradicted by \\"a string of witnesses ... many of them Navy SEALs\\", who depicted him as \\"unstable\\" and \\"an unreliable witness.\\" Sullivan wrote that \\"DeMartino's testimony was probably the most important portion of the court- martial\\" and that most of the conflicts between his testimony and that of other witnesses \\"aren't the kind of thing that two people might have different honest recollections about. Rather, to convict, the members would have to believe that a number of officers and petty officers--SEALS and non-SEALs--are lying.\\" The prosecution presented DeMartinos former superior officer as a rebuttal witness, who described his former subordinate as \\"one of my top sailors--I can depend on him for anything.\\" The defense attorney described the prosecution as \\"asking the jury to take the word of a terrorist and a sailor who admitted initially lying about the incident.\\" Following the completion of the government case and even without all of the defense case having been presented, Sullivan noted that \\"[b]ased on the evidence presented thus far ... I would conclude that the Government has not established its case beyond a reasonable doubt. In fact, if this were a civil case, I would find that the defense prevails under a preponderance of the evidence standard even before seeing the complete defense case.\\" All three men were acquitted, with the Keefe and Huerta courts-martial taking place in Iraq to allow al-Isawi to testify in person. Commentary in conservative media has criticized the Navy for its handling of the abuse allegations. Ray Hartwell, for example, described the U.S. military leadership as having responded just as al-Isawi would have hoped when he \\"played the 'abuse' card\\", by turning against their own troops; an opinion-writer in the New York Post described al-Isawi as having \\"told a preposterous tale of having been beaten and stomped by several men in boots.\\" Keefe and McCabe expressed their views through their collaboration with Robinson on his book titled Honor and Betrayal: The Untold Story of the Navy Seals Who Captured the \\"Butcher of Fallujah\\"--and the Shameful Ordeal They Later Endured. Higbie also expressed his views, both through his books and in interviews where he blamed the courts-martial on the Obama administration. Robinson's book describes the capture of al-Isawi and subsequent events, and its source material includes interviews with seven of the lawyers involved in the McCabe trial; the author's stated aim was to open the door on the functioning of a high-profile court-martial, something rarely seen because \\"they're essentially secret.\\" While covering the facts of the events, Robinson also expresses his view that the experiences of McCabe, Huertas, and Keefe were \\"shocking as their commanders essentially hung them out to dry,\\" and describes the McCabe trial as \\"notorious in its unfairness and anger making to the entire American public.\\" By contrast, the acquittals were met with anger in Iraq, with the head of the Iraqi human rights group Hammurabi describing the courts-martial as \\"just propaganda for [American] justice and democracy\\"; another Iraqi was quoted as having responded to the verdict in the Huertas court-martial by saying that would release him even if he had killed an Iraqi and not just beaten him.\\"  Death  al-Isawi was in Iraqi custody at the time he testified in the Huertas and Keefe courts-martial in April 2010. He was asked directly about his responsibility for the massacre and ambush in Fallujah in 2004, and responded that \\"I have nothing to do with this.\\" His own trial on charges of orchestrating the killings was pending at the time of this testimony. al-Isawi was executed by hanging for his crimes at some point prior to November 2013.

A native of the national capital Bucharest, she was educated at its main university, going on to become a professor there. Together with a focus on interdisciplinary studies, she was noted for devoting several studies to Mihail Eminescu. Meanwhile, Dumitrescu was a dignitary of the Romanian Communist Party. Following the Romanian Revolution, after several years spent in Rome, she retired to a monastery. Biography =Education and academic career= Born in Bucharest, her parents were Nicolae Dumitrescu, a jurist, and his wife Maria (n√©e Apostol). In her native city, she attended primary school (1927-1931) and the Central School for Girls (1931-1939). An early lover of music, she was unable to pursue a career in that field due to medical reasons. Enrolling in the University of Bucharest, she studied law from 1939 to 1943 and literature from 1944 to 1948, and earned a doctorate in 1970. Also, from 1947 to 1948, around the time a communist regime was established in her country, she went to the Soviet Union to attend the Gorky Pedagogical Institute. Florica Dobre (ed.), Membrii C. C. al P. C. R.: 1945-1989, p. 245. Bucharest: Editura EnciclopedicƒÉ, 2004. Dumitrescu worked as an editor at Editura de Stat from 1948 to 1949, and at Editura pentru LiteraturƒÉ until 1957. Hired as teaching assistant at her alma mater in 1949, she rose to assistant professor in 1951, associate professor in 1963, full professor in 1971 and began chairing the department of universal and comparative literature in 1975. Critic Alex. »òtefƒÉnescu, a former student, recalled her courses as being \\"impressive in their erudition and solemnity, and through a veneration of humanist values visibly at odds with the proletarian egalitarianism promoted by the communist regime\\". Having been a researcher there until 1957, she rose to director of the George CƒÉlinescu Institute of Literary History and Theory in 1973. She was admitted to the Romanian Writers' Union in 1963. From 1970 to 1982, she served as vice president of the Social and Political Sciences Academy. She was elected a corresponding member of the Romanian Academy in 1974. In 1975, she became president of the Romanian National Committee for Comparative Literature, from 1973 to 1979 was on the executive board of the International Comparative Literature Association, and in 1972 was visiting professor at the University of Amsterdam. Dumitrescu's rapid ascent in academia drew the ire of Elena Ceau»ôescu, who eventually decided to halt her progress. She directed two magazines, Synthesis and Revista de istorie »ôi teoria literarƒÉ. A comparatist and critic in the Anglo-German mould, her interests included interdisciplinarity and philosophy of culture. Among her books were Rena»ôterea: Umanismul »ôi dialogul artelor (1971), Valori »ôi echivalen»õe umanistice (1973), Periplu umanistic (1980) and Itinerarii prin culturƒÉ (1982). Dumitrescu also initiated and coordinated several syntheses of literary history for the institute she led. Aurel Sasu (ed.), Dic»õionarul biografic al literaturii rom√¢ne, vol. I, p. 539. Pite»ôti: Editura Paralela 45, 2004. Four books she published between 1964 and 1989 closely analyze the works of poet Mihail Eminescu. A gifted communicator, she spoke widely: before students, in conference halls and on radio and television, emerging as a public intellectual. =Political involvement, later years and legacy= Dumitrescu joined the Romanian Communist Party in 1966, the year after Nicolae Ceau»ôescu came to power.

She has contributed to The New Yorker, but a majority of her work has been featured in Texas Monthly, where she was an executive editor. As of 2017, Colloff is a senior reporter at ProPublica and a writer-at-large at The New York Times Magazine.  Early life  Colloff and her brother, David, were raised in Manhattan. Her father, Roger D. Colloff, was vice president and general manager of WCBS-TV in New York City. Her mother, Margery A. Colloff, is counsel to a law firm. Colloff began writing during high school when she was 17 years old. She interviewed Beat poet Allen Ginsberg when he came to her New York City high school. The transcript would later be published in an ‚Äúalternative newspaper‚Äù that Colloff and others published their senior year of high school. Because Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, did not offer a journalism degree, Colloff majored in English literature. While at Brown, Colloff completed several independent studies in which she focused on long-form journalism. Some of these stories were published in a now-defunct college magazine and were picked up by the Associated Press.  Career  Colloff moved to Austin, Texas, after college and sought freelancing opportunities. She wrote for Texas Highway Patrol, a local trade magazine, before working for Might magazine and Details. In 1997, Colloff began working for Texas Monthly as a staff writer, and later as an executive editor. As of 2017, Colloff is a senior reporter at ProPublica and a writer-at-large at The New York Times Magazine. = Style = Many of Colloff‚Äôs crime stories require extensive research. To understand the trials, she reads through court transcripts; re-interviews witnesses, police, investigators and attorneys; and talks to medical and legal experts to understand the jargon. Colloff tries to keep information as simple as possible so that the audience can easily understand it. Colloff builds suspense and momentum in her stories by revealing information at crucial moments. Knowing that many readers now have short attention spans, Colloff tries to keep the reader engaged by using cliffhangers in her writing. This can be seen in ‚ÄúThe Innocent Man,‚Äù which was broken into two stories published a month apart from each other. = \\"Innocence Lost\\" and \\"Innocence Found\\" = Colloff‚Äôs two-part story, ‚ÄúInnocence Lost‚Äù and ‚ÄúInnocence Found‚Äù are about death row inmate Anthony Graves, who was wrongly convicted in 1992 for the murder of a family in Somerville, Texas. After spending 18 years behind bars, Graves was freed in part due to Colloff‚Äôs writing. While writing this series, Colloff interviewed the prosecutor among other key witnesses. Colloff noticed discrepancies between the prosecutor‚Äôs version of events and those presented by the police reports and testimonies in court. She used these inconsistencies in her series to highlight how Graves was wrongly convicted. Colloff‚Äôs in-depth reporting of Graves‚Äô wrongful conviction had lasting consequences. One month after Colloff published ‚ÄúInnocence Lost,‚Äù the Burleson County district attorney‚Äôs office quickly dropped all charges against Graves and released him from jail. Many believe Colloff‚Äôs stories were the persuading factor that helped Graves to win his freedom. = \\"The Innocent Man\\" = Colloff‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Innocent Man‚Äù is another two-part story she published about a wrongful conviction. In 1986, Michael Morton was convicted for the murder of his wife. After being wrongfully incarcerated for 25 years, Morton received freedom and public recognition of his innocence. ‚ÄúThe Innocent Man‚Äù earned Colloff a nomination for the National Magazine Award that she won. Initially, ‚ÄúThe Innocent Man‚Äù was to be published as one cohesive piece instead of a two-part series. Colloff‚Äôs editor suggested breaking the story into two parts when the story reached 16,000 words. = \\"96 Minutes\\" = In \\"96 Minutes\\" Colloff collected dozens of quotations from survivors and witnesses of the August 1, 1966, shootings at the University of Texas at Austin. The 2006 story became the inspiration for Keith Maitland's 2016 documentary film Tower.Sliva, Vanessa. \\"'Tower' shows 1966 shooting from ground.\\" The Daily Texan. May 1, 2014.

The etching was published in Antwerp in 1649 and was inserted into Topographia Bohemiae, Moraviae et Silesiae (Topographia Germaniae), published 1650. He left shortly after to create another perspective, his great view of London in 1647. On the middle sheet is a legend with a signature where Hollar says that the etching was based on drawings, taken in 1636. In 1636 with his new patron, Thomas Howard, he returned briefly from German lands to Prague and then went to England. It is believed that the artwork is preserved and is now in the possession of the National Gallery in Prague. The view is captured from a vantage point on Petrin (Mount St. Lawrence) and Prague is captured from Hradcany after Vysehrad, left, which form the framework of a ruin (with a view of Strahov), then right wall.

She was a militant activist with the Women's Social and Political Union and was jailed at least six times between 1908 and 1912. Early life Elsie Howey was born in Finningley in 1884 to Thomas Howey, the parish's rector, and Emily Gertrude (n√©e Oldfield). When her father died in 1887, the family moved to Malvern, Worcestershire. In 1902 Howey began studying English, French and German at the University of St Andrews. She left the university in 1904 so that she could travel to Germany, where she first came into contact with the women's rights movement. Activism Eagle House, the home of Mary Blathwayt to plant a Nordmann Fir. The honour was given to leading suffragettes Howey joined the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), a militant suffrage organisation, in 1907. In February 1908, she and her sister, Mary Gertrude Howey, were arrested alongside other WSPU members after hiding in a pantechnicon van that was driven into the House of Commons. After her release, she joined Annie Kenney and Mary Blathwayt to campaign at a by-election in Shropshire in May 1908. Soon afterwards, she was imprisoned again for three months for protesting outside the home of then-Prime Minister H. H. Asquith. She was sentenced to six weeks in jail. Her demonstrations became more daring, including hiding overnight in the organ at Colston Hall, Bristol before Augustine Birrell, MP was due to speak, assisted by Vera Holme inside and Minnie Baldock. She went further on 5 September 1910, when Howey and two other suffragettes, Vera Wentworth and Jessie Kenney, assaulted Prime Minister Asquith and Herbert Gladstone while the men were playing golf, and pursued Asquith to his holiday home, left protest cards, saying 'Release Patricia Woodlock' and other suffragette materials in his private garden. Howey's violent tactics were criticised by some other members of the WSPU who called for her removal from the union. The actions proved too much for Mary Blathwayt's family. Her mother, Emily, resigned from the WSPU and her father, Linley, wrote letters of protest to Christabel Pankhurst, Howey and Wentworth. Pankhurst was told that Howey and Wentworth could not visit their house again. Wentworth sent them a long reply expressing regret at their reaction but noting that \\"if Mr. Asquith will not receive deputation they will pummel him again\\". In January 1910, Lady Constance Bulwer-Lytton was imprisoned and forcibly fed at Walton Gaol. In response, Howey broke the gaol governor's windows so that she too would be jailed in support of Lytton. Lytton in turn called Howey the \\"most dear one of our members\\". In April 1910, she received national attention after leading \\"a WSPU demonstration through London dressed as Joan of Arc, in a full set of armour\\" on horseback a role also played by nineteen year old actress Marjery Bryce. In July she was arrested again for demonstrating in Penzance. She was imprisoned for seven days, during which time she undertook a hunger strike and fasted for 144 hours. During 1910 Howey worked to introduce the suffrage movement to Plymouth and Torquay. Howey was jailed at least six times in her career as a suffragette. She often took hunger strikes in prison and endured forcible feeding; on one such occasion it took her four months to recover from the resultant throat injuries. Her last arrest was in December 1912 after setting off a fire alarm. She was sentenced to four months' imprisonment but was released early after a prolonged hunger strike that resulted in the breakage of almost all of her teeth from forcible feeding. Howey had been given a Hunger Strike Medal 'for Valour' by WSPU. Later life Howey retired from public life when the militant suffrage movement ended in 1914. She lived in Malvern for the rest of her life and died there in 1963 from chronic pyloric stenosis. The condition is very rare in adults. It was probably caused by her multiple episodes of forcible feeding.

For the first part of her career RV Cirolana was based in the fishing port of Grimsby, but after bridge and channel dredging work improved the depth, it was deemed acceptable to bring her to Lowestoft. Her engines etc were housed in a sound and vibration proof enclosure which was supported on many pneumatic dampers. She had main electric propulsion motors which powered the screws. All ancillaries were also damped using anti- vibration mountings. All this damping was aimed at reducing noise/vibrations through the superstructure to enable the ability to conduct acoustic surveys of fish populations . She was built in 1969, by Ferguson Shipbuilders, and delivered in 1970. She was placed out of service in approximately 2003 and replaced by RV Cefas Endeavour. On Friday 24 June 1977 RV Cirolana participated in the Silver Jubilee Fleet Review at Spithead in the Solent Service as a fisheries research vessel RV Cirolana was the principle fisheries research vessel employed by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (United Kingdom) throughout the period 1970 to 2003. She was used extensively for fish stock surveys and oceanographic investigations. In the early 1970s RV Cirolana conducted extensive surveys around Greenland, Iceland and the Faroe Islands as well as several trips to the Labrador Sea. In 1973-4, she carried out deep-water surveys down to depths as great as 1200m along the Atlantic continental slope to the west of the British Isles and at banks further out in the Atlantic - Rockall, Hatton, Rosemary Bank and Bill Bailey's. There were ongoing issues with Cirolana's impellers being fouled by floating netting, which would then require that the ship navigate back to a safe harbour on bow thrusters alone, followed by the hire of professional divers to remove the obstruction. In 1999, and again in 2000, she rediscovered a post-medieval wreck at 51.474930N, 5.200480W. The wreck was first reported in July 1945, and is 84m long.

(English: What's Up with Love? 2) is a 2016 Indonesian feature film directed by Riri Riza. It is the sequel to the 2002 cult classic romance Ada Apa dengan Cinta? with Dian Sastrowardoyo and Nicholas Saputra reprising their roles as Cinta and Rangga. The film takes place 14 years after the events of the first film and tells how Cinta and Rangga are dealing with their lives after their off screen break-up before finally meeting each other again as old unresolved sparks and feelings begin to emerge from both former lovers. The film was made after the immense reception of LINE's promotional short film that featuring AADCs cast, which got many people to ask Mira Lesmana and Riri Riza to create a feature-length sequel for the beloved teen romance. As a result, the film was officially developed. The film ignores all the events in AADC? 2014, such as Cinta and Rangga both having different jobs than in the short, and despite actress Ladya Cheryl reprising her role in the short, she couldn't appear in the feature sequel and her character was written out as having died in this film. Highly anticipated, the film was released on 28 April 2016 simultaneously in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei Darussalam. The film was released to critical and commercial success. It surpassed the first film's total audiences and currently stands as the most watched Indonesian film of 2016 in those countries, with over 3.5 million ticket sales.  Plot  Cinta (Dian Sastrowardoyo) is now the owner of a mini pop art caf√© in Jakarta. She and her high school gang comforts Karmen (Adinia Wirasti), who is recovering from drug addiction. Milly (Sissy Priscillia) is married to the gang's formerly geek high school mate Mamet (Dennis Adhiswara) and is currently pregnant with their first child, while Maura (Titi Kamal) is married to Chris (Christian Sugiono) with 4 kids. Cinta announces that the ladies will go on a vacation to Jogjakarta and that she is engaged to her boyfriend Trian (Ario Bayu). Meanwhile, in New York City, Rangga (Nicholas Saputra) is the co-owner of a coffee shop when his step-sister, Sukma (Dimi Cindyastira), pays a visit to ask him to visit his estranged mother in Jogjakarta, but he refuses. He ultimately has a change of heart and decided to go there after his co-owner and friend Roberto (Chase Kuertz) convinced him that he should go back to Indonesia to tie up his loose ends. Before the ladies go, they visit Alya's (Ladya Cheryl) grave, which is explained later in the film that she died in an accident in 2010. Rangga arrives in Jakarta to find that Cinta is no longer living in her old house, so he continues on to Jogjakarta. In Jogjakarta, while vacationing, Karmen and Milly sees Rangga on the road, and they tell Cinta about it. Cinta refuses to see him at first, but after an argument with Karmen, she decides to do so. It is revealed that they broke up in 2006. Cinta expresses her resentment towards him for gratuitously ending their relationship and that she only agreed to meet him because of her friends. Rangga explains that he broke up with her because of his academic and vocational struggles, and he thought that he couldn't make Cinta happy. However, they decide to end things in friendly terms. Cinta ended up spending the whole day with Rangga, forgetting her vacation schedule with her friends. Before parting ways, Cinta kisses Rangga, to the shock of both former lovers. Cinta then returns to Jakarta and Rangga pays his mother a visit. Cinta can't get Rangga out of her head and before returning to New York, Rangga stop by in Jakarta and goes to Cinta's caf√©. He admits that he want them to be more than friends again but she replied that the kiss meant nothing, leaving him furious. Rangga storms out of the caf√© as Trian arrives. Trian, noticing Cinta's changed behavior after the Jogjakarta trip, and after seeing Rangga himself, confronts Cinta about Rangga, resulting in the end of the engagement. Rangga flies back to New York while a distressed Cinta has a near death experience on the freeway, but walked away with no injuries. A month later in New York, Rangga and Roberto gives their employee Donna (Lei-Lei Bavoil) a raise, and in gratitude she hugs him; just as Cinta unexpectedly enters the caf√©. Misinterpreting the situation, Cinta ran away. Rangga gives chase, straightening the situation and they express their love for each other, and share a passionate kiss in the snowy Central Park, united at last. Before the credits, Rangga and Cinta are seemingly holding their baby, until Mamet came and ask them for his new baby back.

He is an important scholar of twentieth- century Italy, in particular of the Fascist period and the relationship between Italians and the Catholic Church.  Biography  Giordano Bruno Guerri was born in Iesa, a district of Monticiano, in the province of Siena.https://biografieonline.it/biografia.htm?BioID=2281&biografia;=Giordano+Bruno+Guerri He is the son of Gina Guerri and Febo Anselmi, known as Ebo. Febo took Gina as his second wife, after the introduction of divorce in Italy. Despite his name, his family provided him with a Catholic education. He told their story, from his grandparents to his infancy, in Ebo e Gina, published as an addition to the Corriere della Sera in July 2011. His parents, farmers living in Colle Val d‚ÄôElsa (Siena) after having been manual workers, opened a restaurant, and later a grocery store that went bankrupt. For two years (1963‚Äì64), they worked in Viareggio as domestic help, and in 1965 they moved with Giordano to Ospiate di Bollate, on the outskirts of Milan, to be a worker. There he alternated his studies with temporary jobs. He took part in the Sessantotto (the upheavals of 1968) ‚Äúlike a wild, snarling dog, but not politicized‚Äù and received his high school diploma in 1969. He then enrolled in the Department of Modern Literature (specializing in contemporary history) at the Universit√† Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, in Milan. He himself would later say that this was out of curiosity to learn about life under the Fascist regime, described too superficially in his opinion by historians of that era. At the start of his university studies, he went to live on his own, working as a proofreader, first at home and later at Garzanti, where he was employed until 1980. His Norme grafiche e redazionali, written in 1971 for Bompiani, is still in use. He graduated in 1974, having written a thesis entitled La Figura e l‚Äôopera di Giuseppe Bottai, un fascista critico, published by Feltrinelli in 1976. In 1982 he was one of the curators of the exhibition Anni Trenta: Arte e cultura in Italia, mounted in the Palazzo Reale di Milano (Royal Palace of Milan), the Arengario, and the Galleria del Sagrato. In 1985, after the success of his essay Povera santa, povero assassino: La vera storia di Santa Maria Goretti (published by Mondadori), he was named director of the monthly journal Storia Illustrata, even though he was not a journalist. Having finished his term there, he was enrolled in the roster of journalists in 1986. Using the concept of linking history to current events, he raised sales from 60 to 150,000 copies, and in 1986, he was promoted to editorial director of Mondadori, a position from which he resigned in 1988. In 1989, he became director of the monthly journal Chorus, a position he held until 1991, when he moved to New York. In 1995, Guerri moved back to Rome and was offered the opportunity to host Italia mia bench√©, a TV show, with Cinzia Tani, which ran until 1997. From 2003 to 2008 he was president of the Fondazione Ugo Bordoni, a cultural institute in the information technology and communications sector. In this capacity, he strove to be a ‚Äòbridge between humanistic culture and scientific culture‚Äô and founded the ForumTal, of which he is still president. TAL (Trattamento Automatico del Linguaggio) is the technology that teaches machines to understand, speak, and write Italian. On 1 April 2004, he also took over the direction of L‚ÄôIndipendente, (where he made himself known for his impartial positions, for criticism of the right, and for having published on the front page an aphorism of the American poet John Giorno: ‚ÄòNo dick is as hard as life is‚Äô). He was replaced in February 2005 by Gennaro Malgieri. In 1984, Guerri began a collaboration with Il Giornale http://www.ilgiornale.it/autore/giordano-bruno-guerri.htmlas a political and social columnist. In the meantime, he taught courses in contemporary history in the political science departments of the universities of Salerno, Madrid, Genoa, and Rio de Janeiro, and at Columbia University, in New York. Now he teaches contemporary history at the Universit√† Guglielmo Marconi] in Rome. Since October 2008, he has been president (and since 2014 General Director) of the Fondazione Vittoriale degli Italiani, the home of Gabriele D‚ÄôAnnunzio in Gardone Riviera. Through innovative exhibitions and the acquisition of works of contemporary art and important documents, he has given it new life, increasing the number of visitors from 146,000 to 250,000. In 2016, Dario Franceschini, Minister of Cultural Heritage and Tourism, officially extended his term until 2021. Since 2015, Guerri has been president of the Fondazione Opera pia Carit√† laicale and director of MuSa, the Museo di Sal√≤. In 2016, he founded GardaMusei, which he directs, a cultural and tourism association based on cooperation among localities, museums, and other institutions. It has grown to include the Fondazione Guglielmo Marconi (Emilia-Romagna), the Fondazione Giovanni Pascoli (Tuscany), and Italian cultural institutes in other countries. In the spring of 2017, Bocconi d‚Äôinchiostro, the student-led ‚Äòsalotto‚Äô (literary gathering) of the Universit√† commerciale Luigi Bocconi di Milano, awarded him the ‚ÄòDante d‚ÄôOro‚Äô for his complete oeuvre, a prize that is just one of many he has received.  Private life  After his first marriage (1983-1988) to the writer Gaia de Beaumont, Guerri became involved with the author Paola Veneto in 2005. They married in 2014 and have two sons, Nicola Giordano (2006) and Pietro Tancredi (2011).  Politics  Guerri defines himself as liberal, libertarian, laissez-faire, and an ex-libertine, like the Partito Radicale, which he has sometimes supported in the past and shares views with, such as the struggle against the death penalty. He and Ida Magli founded a cultural movement, ‚ÄòItalianiLiberi‚Äô, anti-Europe and free-thinking, for which he has directed the online journal italianiliberi.it. After television came employment in the public sector. Mario Caligiuri, mayor of the Calabrian commune of Soveria Mannelli, offered him the position of cultural advisor. Guerri accepted but set as a condition being called ‚ÄòAdvisor for the Dissolution of the Obvious‚Äô, a title under which he did indeed begin serving on 1 August 1997. Among the explanations he gave for his sudden departure from this post, which he had himself created, was ‚Äòtoo many official dinners‚Äô. During his four weeks in this position, however, he received attention for a few provocative ordinances, for example the Monument to the Rubbish Bin (Garbage Can). The idea behind it was to inform public opinion about the inappropriateness of placing unattractive rubbish bins in areas of cities of high artistic or architectural value. As cultural advisor, he also promoted the first ‚ÄòWhite Night‚Äô (an all-night arts festival) in Italy, which took place in the Presila region of Calabria on 18 August 1997. In 2006, he was one of the signers of the manifesto of the Riformatori Liberali, which requested dialogue with the center-right coalition on various ethical matters like euthanasia, soft drug use, prostitution, and gay marriage.  Literary output  In 1976, Feltrinelli published his university thesis entitled Giuseppe Bottai, un fascista critico. Appearing at the same time as Renzo De Felice‚Äôs book on popular acceptance of the Fascist regime, the essay placed him amongst the most authoritative Italian historic ‚Äòrevisionists‚Äô. The biography of the party official opened the debate on Fascist culture and its continued influence on Italian society after World War II. This is a subject to which Guerri returned, contributing to scientific and educational journals (for example, editing the social and political life section of the catalogue for the exhibition Anni Trenta, organized by the city of Milan in 1982). During this period, Guerri wrote four books that comprise his series on the Fascist ruling class: Rapporto al Duce (Bompiani, 1978), a collection of historic documents; a biography of Galeazzo Ciano, son of the party official as well as Mussolini‚Äôs son-in-law (Bompiani, 1979); L‚ÄôArcitaliano: Vita di Curzio Malaparte, based on previously unpublished documents about his life; and an essay on Italo Balbo. He was editor of the Diaries of Giuseppe Bottai, in two volumes (Volume I: 1935-1944 and Volume II, 1944-1948), published by Rizzoli in 1982 and 1988. In 1983, Guerri published Io, l‚Äôinfame (Mondadori, 1983), a biography of Red Brigade member Patrizio Peci, written together with the terrorist during a two-week period when Peci was in hiding from his ex- comrades. In spite of his Catholic education, Guerri considered himself an atheist. He was not concerned with religious questions until he was 32 years old, when he began to write Povera santa, Povero assassino, the story of Maria Goretti. When the book came out, in February 1985, Cardinal Pietro Palazzini, prefect of the Congregazione per le cause dei santi, called it ‚Äúan instrument of the Devil‚Äô. Controversy also surrounded Guerri's book Io ti assolvo, his account of false confessions made to priests during a trip around Italy, in which he highlighted differences among Catholic priests on the same subjects as well as their varied approaches to the appropriate penitence, all of which he found questionable. These two books were strongly criticized by the Vatican and by Catholic institutions in general. Anticlericalism and secular points of view on spiritualism appeared several times in his television appearances as well. Another educational work is Fascisti: Gli italiani di Mussolini, il regime degli italiani (Mondadori, 1995). In 1992, Guerri published Gli italiani sotta la Chiesa: Da san Pietro a Mussolini (Mondadori) and in 1997, L‚ÄôAntistoria degli italiani: Da Romolo a Giovanni Paolo II, which is coming out in an updated version in May 2018. Other important works are the biographies of Ernesto Buonaiuti, Gabriele D‚ÄôAnnunzio, and Filippo Tommaso Marinetti. In 2018, he published D‚ÄôAnnunzio e il piacere della moda, with photos by Lorenzo Capellini (Rubbettino). Il Giornale published a collection of his articles entitled Lezioni di libert√†: Contro I pregiudizi, i luoghi comuni, l‚Äôomologazione: un grande maestro del pensiero. His works have been translated into French, English, Dutch, Polish, Portuguese, Serbian, Croatian, Spanish, German, and Hungarian.  Writings  * Giuseppe Bottai, un fascista critico.

The Tomahawk attracted significant press and industry attention for its striking design, its outsize- displacement, 10-cylinder car engine, and its four close-coupled wheels, which give it a motorcycle-like appearance. Experts disagreed on whether it is a true motorcycle. The Retro-Art Deco design's central visual element is the , V10 SRT10 engine from the Dodge Viper sports car. The Tomahawk's two front and two rear wheels are sprung independently, which would allow it to lean into corners and countersteer like a motorcycle. Dodge press releases and spokespeople gave various hypothetical top speeds ranging from to as high as , which analysts thought were probably calculated with only horsepower and final drive ratio alone, without accounting for drag, rolling resistance, and stability. These estimates, and the more conservative a designer suggested could be possible, were debunked as implausible, or physically impossible, by the motorcycling and automotive media. No independent road tests of the Tomahawk have ever been published, and the company said that in internal testing it was never ridden above . Hand-built replicas of the Tomahawk were offered for sale through the Neiman Marcus catalog at a price of US$555,000, and up to nine might have sold. As they were not street legal, Dodge called the Tomahawk a \\"rolling sculpture\\", not intended to be ridden. Industry experts said the Tomahawk was a resounding success at one-upping rivals and taking the trade show spotlight, and was a branding and marketing coup, generating media buzz and sending the message that Chrysler was a bold, ambitious company, unafraid to take risks. Inception The idea for a Viper- engined motorcycle started with two lower-level Chrysler Group employees, Bob Schroeder, a design office modeler and motorcycle rider, and Dave Chyz, vehicle build specialist and drag racer. According to designer Mark Walters, the question asked was, \\"What if we had a Viper engine and a Champion chassis? Something like a Boss Hoss\\", resulting in an engine displacement five times a typical Harley-Davidson. The low-volume Boss Hoss motorcycle is built around a Chevrolet V8, and the largest-displacement mass-produced motorcycle is the Triumph Rocket III, neither anywhere close to the Viper engine. The only motorcycle with a displacement in the Tomahawk's league uses the same V-10 car engine, the one-off 2009 Millyard Viper V10, a bike created to rival the Tomahawk after Allen Millyard was underwhelmed by a Tomahawk speed run at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in the UK. Schroeder and Chyz took the proposal to Senior Vice President of Design Trevor Creed, who initially said, \\"we don't build bikes\\" but still allowed some design sketches to be created, which were \\"mind blowing\\" enough to bring Creed on board. They eventually took the idea to Freeman Thomas, DaimlerChrysler VP of advanced design, who assigned Walters to join the effort. Thomas suggested using two front and rear wheels because a single wheel would look thin next to the unusually wide engine, inspired by the four-wheeled light cycles in the film Tron. Walters anticipated howls from bikers that this would make it not a motorcycle, but he felt uniqueness was more important, and imagined the appearance with only a single wheel in front of and behind the engine would have been visually unbalanced, saying he would like to see it made that way for comparison. By the spring of 2002, Walters had prepared a full scale design presentation, with sketches along a wall and a borrowed Viper engine resting on an engine stand with two wheels placed fore and aft as a visual aid. This was presented to Chrysler Group COO, Wolfgang Bernhard, and CEO, Dieter Zetsche, who gave their immediate approval. Design 1986 Elf 3 Honda with hub-center steering, in the Honda Collection Hall The design was the work of Chrysler staff designer Mark Walters, who built the vehicle around the Dodge Viper V-10 engine. Once approved by Bernhard and Zetsche to build not just a full-scale mockup, but a running, workable concept vehicle, the design and fabrication process took six months. The engineering, as well as the fabrication, was outsourced to RM Motorsports, a Wixom, Michigan specialty shop that fabricates one-of-a-kind parts for rare and vintage race cars. Walters said Kirt Bennett at RM handled the task of making Walters' sketches a physical reality that was mechanically sound. Walters' early sketches had a front suspension that looked something like an Elf-Honda racing motorcycle's hub-center steering, from which RM designed a new, patented front- and rear-swingarm suspension that allows both parallel wheels to lean together, keeping all four in contact with the ground and allowing countersteering. The Tomahawk was intended, unlike many concept vehicles, to be a \\"functional runner\\" that \\"had to work\\" as well as have a finished appearance, since the mechanical parts would be exposed to view. The V-10 engine needed several design changes. To position the engine lower to the ground, the lubrication system was changed from wet sump to a dry sump type, moving the under-engine oil sump to a tank located in front of and to the left of the engine. The car-style single radiator out in front of the engine was changed to two smaller radiators and fitted into the V-shaped space above the engine, where cooling air is force-fed using a belt-driven fan sourced from a Porsche 911. =Suspension= The Tomahawk has an independent suspension on all four wheels designed to allow the rider to countersteer and lean into turns like a tilting three-wheeler. There is a hub-center steering style swingarm connected to the outboard side of each of the two front wheels, with a steering link connected to the handlebar shaft. There is very little lock- to-lock steering range, only about 20¬∞ on either side of center, so the turning radius of the Tomahawk is large; \\"only a little tighter than an SR-71\\", said Motorcyclists Jeff Karr. A low center of gravity, accomplished by situating the engine as low to ground as possible, is intended to provide greater control at low speeds, and a low saddle allows riders to place both feet on the ground when stopped, for greater stability. The two rear wheels also each have an independent swingarm, but on the inboard side, along with an inboard chain drive for each wheel. The rider can engage a rear suspension lock, which hydraulically holds the two wheels' relative positions, letting the vehicle stand on its own, without using a side stand. According to computer imaging, the suspension would allow a lean of up to 45¬∞ with all four wheels maintaining contact with the ground before one of the swingarms contacted the ground, although attempting to actually corner at such extreme angles is not safe given the Tomahawk's weight. Test rides for the purpose of photographing the Tomahawk in action revealed that there were still stability issues to be worked out, given that it rides, \\"like two motorcycles riding in ultraclose formation, coupled with the weight of three and the horsepower of four,\\" in Karr's words, meaning that, \\"some disagreement is inevitable.\\" RM Motorsports's Bud Bennett said the 45¬∞ lean system worked well and was in fact stable, quashing rumors that any test riders had been thrown from the Tomahawk, and that the only issue was the original design's limited 18¬∞ handlebar turning radius, making sharp turns impossible. In 2003 RM Motorsports had been working on designs for versions with wider handlebars allowing more control, and two or three wheels instead of four, making a street-legal Tomahawk conceivable. Bud Bennett said that at RM they thought the narrower, limited-range handlebars and unnecessary two front wheels instead of one would not function well, but at the time the design was \\"just a concept\\" with no anticipated customer demand, and as a concept vehicle, the Tomahawk did \\"everything it was supposed to do, which is to push the Dodge name and to celebrate the Viper engine.\\" Fabrication Bennett's team at RM custom-milled the Tomahawk components from blocks of aluminum. Under the seat are two alloy pieces that began as billets that are machined down to each, and polished to a mirror finish. Details like hand levers and the twistgrip use needle and ball bearings. Detroit Auto Show debut The Tomahawk debuted at what Automobile Magazine called the high point of a period of increasing extravagance at the Cobo Hall Detroit Auto Show (officially the North American International Auto Show) that began with the expansion of the show in 1986‚Äì1987, leading to the splashy debuts of ever larger and more powerful cars and trucks, such as the Hummer H2 in 2000 and the Ford GT40 in 2002. Newsweek described the period as a \\"horsepower arms race\\". The 2003 show had the largest ever attendance, 810,699, and the limits of concept excess were pushed further with the 7.0L V-10 Ford 427 Concept, which had a V-8 hastily expanded to 10 cylinders in response to rumors that Cadillac was going to show a V-10, only to be outdone when the rumored V-10 turned out to be the Cadillac Sixteen, with a claimed V16 that could shut down 8 or 12 cylinders at a time to save fuel. Yet even these monsters would be upstaged by an even more unexpected debut, Dodge's V-10 motorcycle, unveiled the day after the Sixteen. In response, GM executive Bob Lutz, who himself had helped conceive the Viper in 1988 when he was at Chrysler, was asked where his 1,000 hp V-16 motorcycle was, and he answered, in the wry spirit of the question, that he had none, pounding the table and saying, \\"Rats, outmaneuvered by Chrysler again!\\" AutoWeek named the Ford 427 \\"Best Concept\\" and the Cadillac V-16 \\"Best in Show\\" for 2003, and the editors said they wished they had an award for \\"Best Automotive Sculpture\\" to give to the unexpected motorcycle they found so likable. The jury of 35 journalists of the North American Concept Vehicle of the Year chose the General Motors Hy-wire over the Tomahawk for the 2003 Specialty Concept Vehicle of the Year award. The Tomahawk was remembered in 2014 by Automotive News as one of the \\"10 Most Memorable World Debuts\\". In the years after the Tomahawk made its high-profile entrance, the Detroit Auto Show became more modest in scale, and the automakers' battle to outdo each other with boundary-breaking dream cars faded in the years leading up to the 2008 auto industry crisis, and the more cautious recovery that followed. Performance claims Stainless steel rear cowl and top of Tomahawk, with handlebars connected to a vertical stalk. At the Walter P. Chrysler Museum, Michigan. As introduced in 2003, the one-of-a-kind Tomahawk was operational and road-ready, but not fully road-tested, and acceleration and top speed were not confirmed; Dodge described the vehicle both as \\"automotive sculpture,\\" intended for display only, while also saying it was \\"rideable\\". DaimlyerChrysler spokespeople declined Popular Sciences requests to test the Tomahawk's performance, or to speak to the company's test riders, or to share those riders' riding impressions. =Top speed= Speculation about the Tomahawk's top speed came from the media, and within DaimlerChrysler. One Dodge representative said, \\"If a 3,400-pound Viper goes 190, this'll go 400, easy.\\" Senior designer Walters, who was in charge of the Tomahawk project, said he did not believe published speeds of 400 mph were possible, noting that the bike was geared for acceleration, and if geared for speed, would be within reach. A real-world speed run of the Millyard Viper V10 achieved with the same as the Tomahawk. Car and Driver, though enthusiastic over \\"arguably the oddest, coolest, most over-the-top concept ever\\", expressed \\"doubt that anyone has actually tried\\" reaching 60 mph in 2.5 seconds, \\"or its estimated top speed of 300-plus mph.\\" Phil Patton of The New York Times wrote, \\"In theory, the Tomahawk can blast from a standing start to 60 miles an hour in two and a half seconds and reach 300 miles an hour. In practice, since Evel Knievel retired, it's hard to imagine anyone willing to prove it.\\" Cycle Worlds John Phillips derided the top speed claims by saying that at the Detroit Auto Show, \\"Cadillac unveiled its own paean to one-upmanship a mere 50 yards away‚Äîa luxo sedan with a V-16 [the Cadillac Sixteen] producing 1000 bhp. Twice the Tomahawk's output. Which means‚Äîat least by Dodge's amusingly convoluted logic‚Äîthat Caddy's engine could propel the bike to 800 mph.\\" =Dodge's changing claims= Popular Science said Dodge initially announced the top speed of the Tomahawk was estimated at a theoretical speed of , but later revised this downward to , and spokesmen did not answer questions on how this estimate was calculated. Motorcycle Consumer News reported that the two conflicting figures, 300 and 420 mph were actually released simultaneously by Dodge, \\"on the same press page\\". The January 6, 2003 press release from Dodge announcing the Tomahawk and listing the specifications said it had \\"a potential top speed of nearly 400 miles per hour\\" and also said \\"Performance: 0-60 mph: 2.5 seconds (est.) Top Speed: 300+ mph (est.)\\". It also said, \\"It is both a sculpture that can be ridden, as well as a bold statement about the Chrysler Group's enthusiast culture and passion for design.\\" Later press releases, in 2006 and in 2009, repeated the phrase \\"a potential top speed of nearly 400 miles per hour\\". =Aerodynamic considerations= Jeff Karr, in Motorcyclist magazine, agreed with chief designer Mark Walters's comments that perhaps was conceivable, according to rough calculations suggesting that motorcycles with far less drag, like the Suzuki Hayabusa and Kawasaki ZX-12R would need on the order of to reach only 300 mph, and so the Tomahawk, with at least 50% more drag than those bikes, would have to have at least to attain even , given that drag increases as the square of speed. Without protection from wind blast and a secure riding position, however, approaching even , let alone , would be unsafe due to the instability of the design, and the lack of any provision to prevent aerodynamic lift from pulling the rider off the seat. Dave Campos, motorcycle land speed record rider, doubted the Tomahawk could reach because at high speeds, the rider would be \\"lifted right off the bike\\" without a fairing, and the four-wheel steering could also be a problem. Joe Teresi of Easyriders magazine, owner of Campos' record-setting streamliner motorcycle, said the top speed estimate must have been based only on horsepower and final drive ratio, and ignored the \\"critical factors\\" of frontal area, drag coefficient, and rolling resistance. =Testing= Dodge spokesman David Elshoff said that Tomahawk would someday be taken for a run at the Bonneville Speedway, but no such attempt was ever made. Chrysler's chief operating officer Wolfgang Bernhard said in 2003 that no one had ridden the Tomahawk faster than . Dodge declined offers to put the top speed claim to a test or to allow testing with a dynamometer that can simulate a top speed test, and no one is known to have attempted to ride the Tomahawk to its maximum speed. In 2003 a Tomahawk was ridden by Bud Bennett of RM Motorsports at the Goodwood Festival of Speed, but was able to complete only a single run, which he said \\"probably\\" reached . Bennett said that up to then only four riders had ever ridden a Tomahawk. Critical reception Most motorcycling, automotive, and science press greeted the Tomahawk with jokes and sarcasm roasting the Tomahawk, such as AutoWeek suggesting anyone riding the Tomahawk was a Darwin Award contender, and a 2015 book calling it \\"the strangest\\" of the 2003 Dodge vehicles and \\"one of Chrysler's nuttiest concepts\\". Freelance motorcycle designer and Motorcycle Consumer News columnist Glynn Kerr, however, wrote an analysis that took it seriously and critiqued it as he would a \\"real\\" motorcycle. Kerr described the top speed claims from Dodge as the work of \\"spin doctors\\", but said that the \\"less than convincing\\" \\"high-speed antics\\", combined with the failure to provide an obvious necessity of a fairing for a true high-speed motorcycle, or a fuel tank large enough to provide greater than range, were consistent with several indicators in the design of carelessness and laziness. Kerr called to task the car designers for a lack of curiosity about the basic tenets of motorcycle design, saying they were \\"underwhelmed\\" by the challenge. He said the Tomahawk \\"illustrates how the automotive industry considers motorcycles a lesser form of its own discipline\\" and so \\"feel entirely qualified to redesign one whenever they run out of ideas for sports cars.\\" Morbidelli V8 design was criticized by Glynn Kerr, like the Tomahawk's, for ignoring motorcycle-specific design rules. Kerr blamed this disregard of the rules of motorcycle design for the use of \\"too much over-simplified bodywork\\" on the Pininfarina Morbidelli V8, which the Tomahawk at least avoided, while still \\"missing the point about bikes.\\" The indecision between making a sport bike or cruiser led to the uncomfortable ergonomics of a dragster motorcycle, but it did not matter because the Tomahawk was \\"not intended to be taken seriously\\", notwithstanding the intention to produce a limited production run. While he found the basic shape \\"not unpleasant\\", the unseriousness led to an unfinished result, pointing out the lack of harmonization in the twin ram-air intakes, and the \\"incongruous\\" use of a retro single vertical stalk planted in the fuel tank in an otherwise futuristic design. Kerr acknowledges that DaimlerChrysler does not \\"give a damn\\" about the motorcycle industry point of view, because the Tomahawk was successful in its real purpose, \\"creating an almighty furor within the automotive world.\\" Motorcyclist magazine's Jeff Karr speculated the boredom with having designed too many outlandish show cars, especially with DaimlerChrysler's history of doing the unexpected, made the designers want to do this for \\"the sheer outrage of the exercise\\", creating \\"a machine so resolutely evil, it has chunks of V-Max in its stool\\", \\"the ultimate bad-ass ride.\\" Karr was positive about the \\"simultaneously futuristic and nostalgic\\" appearance where Glynn Kerr saw indecisiveness. In response to automotive writer Stephan Wilkinson's suggestion that the Tomahawk was \\"essentially worthless\\" as a \\"usable vehicle\\", Design Continuum's Alan Mudd disagreed. Mudd said it \\"showed the public that Chrysler is made up of a bunch of passionate people. Even if it is a total adolescent wet dream, it has value because it tells the consumer that Chrysler is full of excited, creative people who just want to try some great new stuff.\\" Lars Erik Lundin of Volvo's Concept Center in California said, \\"there's absolutely no risk that Volvo would ever do such craziness\\", adding that such flights of fancy \\"raise people's expectations\\", noting that Volvo showed a hybrid car in 1992 yet failed to deliver one even 12 years later. GM designer and automotive columnist Robert Cumberford agreed that leaving consumers disappointed is a risk, noting that the public loved the Range Stormer concept, creating a panic at Land Rover when they had nothing as \\"zoomy\\" to sell. Wilkinson said that concept cars serve less today as platforms to introduce new technology, such as power windows, LED lights, voice controls, or traffic display screens, and are instead more marketing tools and styling exercises. The New York Times asked various auto industry luminaries to pick the standouts among their competitors at the 2003 Detroit Auto Show, including Jin Kim of Toyota's Calty Design Research, who picked the Cadillac Sixteen, the Dodge Kahuna, and the Tomahawk, saying, \\"Just the fact that they had the guts to put that thing on the turntable, you've got to give them credit. It's almost an icon of American automotive history, the raw power and sheer adrenaline. The whole thing looked like it was machined, milled out of a raw block of metal. It looked like something you would see in a futuristic movie.\\" Ford's Camilo Pardo, Chief Designer of the Ford GT, also chose the Sixteen, and the Tomahawk, saying, \\"I'd like to give them a lot of credit for experimenting with a vehicle completely outside their categories. It was brave, and I thought the execution was really well done, very mature. It's a beautiful piece, and I'd love to have it sitting in a living room as a piece of art.\\" Hyundai-Kia's Eric Stoddard agreed that \\"[t]hey are presenting the idea that they are not afraid to try anything, even a V-10 Viper-powered motorcycle.\\" See also * Gunbus 410 References Category:Dodge concept vehicles Category:Concept motorcycles Category:Motorcycles introduced in 2003 Category:Collection of Walter P.

This is combined with intelligent reporting and data analytics. The objective is to let simulation drive the design, to predict product behavior rather than to react on issues which may arise, and to install a process that lets design continue after product delivery.  Industry needs  In a classic development approach, manufacturers deliver discrete product generations. Before bringing those to market, they use extensive verification and validation processes, usually by combining several simulation and testing technologies. But this approach has several shortcomings when looking at how products are evolving. Manufacturers in the automotive industry, the aerospace industry, the marine industry or any other mechanical industry all share similar challenges: they have to re-invent the way they design to be able to deliver what their customers want and buy today. =Complex products that include smart systems= Products include, besides the mechanics, ever more electronics, software and control systems. Those help to increase performance for several characteristics, such as safety, comfort, fuel economy and many more. Designing such products using a classic approach, is usually ineffective. A modern development process should be able to predict the behavior of the complete system for all functional requirements and including physical aspects from the very beginning of the design cycle. =The use of new materials and manufacturing methods= To achieve reduced costs or fuel economy, manufacturers need to continually consider adopting new materials and corresponding manufacturing methods. That makes product development more complex, as engineers cannot rely on their decades of experience anymore, like they did when working with traditional materials, such as steel and aluminium, and traditional manufacturing methods, such as casting. New materials such as composites, behave differently when it comes to structural behavior, thermal behavior, fatigue behavior or noise insulation for example, and require dedicated modeling. On top of that, as design engineers do not always know all manufacturing complexities that come with using these new materials, it is possible that the \\"product as manufactured\\" is different from the \\"product as designed\\". Of course all changes need to be tracked, and possibly even an extra validation iteration needs to be done after manufacturing. = Product development continues after delivery = Today's products include many sensors that allow them to communicate with each other, and to send feedback to the manufacturer. Based on this information, manufacturers can send software updates to continue optimizing behavior, or to adapt to a changing operational environment. Products will create the internet of things, and manufacturers should be part of it. A product \\"as designed\\" is never finished, so development should continue when the product is in use. This evolution is also referred to as Industry 4.0,Klaus Schwab, 2016: The Fourth Industrial Revolution, accessed on 13 May 2016 or the fourth industrial revolution. It challenges design teams, as they need to react quickly and make behavioral predictions based on an enormous amount of data. = The inclusion of predictive functionality = The ultimate intelligence a product can have, is that it remembers the individual behavior of its operator, and takes that into consideration. In this way, it can for example anticipate certain actions, predict failure or maintenance, or optimize energy consumption in a self-regulating manner. That requires a predictive model inside the product itself, or accessible via cloud. This one should run very fast and should behave exactly the same as the actual product. It requires the creation of a digital twin: a replica of the product that remains in-sync over its entire product lifecycle. = Ever increasing pressure on time, cost, quality and diversification = Consumers today can get easy access to products that are designed in any part of the world. That puts an enormous pressure on the time-to-market, the cost and the product quality. It's a trend which has been going on for decades. But with people making ever more buying decisions online, it has become more relevant than ever. Products can easily be compared in terms of price and features on a global scale. And reactions on forums and social media can be very grim when product quality is not optimal. This comes on top of the fact that in different parts of the world, consumer have different preferences, or even different standards and regulations are applicable. As a result, modern development processes should be able to convert very local requirements into a global product definition, which then should be rolled out locally again, potentially with part of the work being done by engineers in local affiliates. That calls for a firm globally operating product lifecycle management system that starts with requirements definition. And the design process should have the flexibility to effectively predict product behavior and quality for various market needs.  Enabling processes and technologies  Dealing with these challenges is exactly the aim of a predictive engineering analytics approach for product development. It refers to a combination of tools deployment and a good alignment of processes. Manufacturers gradually deploy the following methods and technologies, to an extent that their organization allows it and their products require it: = Deploying a closed-loop systems- driven product development process = In this multi-disciplinary simulation- based approach, the global design is considered as a collection of mutually interacting subsystems from the very beginning. From the very early stages on, the chosen architecture is virtually tested for all critical functional performance aspects simultaneously. These simulations use scalable modeling techniques, so that components can be refined as data becomes available. Closing the loop happens on 2 levels: * Concurrent development of the mechanical components with the control systems * Inclusion of data of products in use (in case of continued development the actual product) Closed-loop systems driven product development aims at reducing test-and-repair. Manufacturers implement this approach to pursue their dream of designing right the first time. = Increasing the use of 1D multi-physics system simulation = 1D system simulation, also referred to as 1D CAE or mechatronics system simulation, allows scalable modeling of multi-domain systems. The full system is presented in a schematic way, by connecting validated analytical modeling blocks of electrical, hydraulic, pneumatic and mechanical subsystems (including control systems). It helps engineers predict the behavior of concept designs of complex mechatronics, either transient or steady-state. Manufacturers often have validated libraries available that contain predefined components for different physical domains. Or if not, specialized software suppliers can provide them. Using those, the engineers can do concept predictions very early, even before any Computer-aided Design (CAD) geometry is available. During later stages, parameters can then be adapted. 1D system simulation calculations are very efficient. The components are analytically defined, and have input and output ports. Causality is created by connecting inputs of a components to outputs of another one (and vice versa). Models can have various degrees of complexity, and can reach very high accuracy as they evolve. Some model versions may allow real-time simulation, which is particularly useful during control systems development or as part of built-in predictive functionality. = Improving 3D simulation technologies = 3D simulation or 3D CAE is usually applied at a more advanced stage of product development than 1D system simulation, and can account for phenomena that cannot be captured in 1D models. The models can evolve into highly detailed representations that are very application-specific and can be very computationally intensive. 3D simulation or 3D CAE technologies were already essential in classic development processes for verification and validation, often proving their value by speeding up development and avoiding late-stage changes. 3D simulation or 3D CAE are still indispensable in the context of predictive engineering analytics, becoming a driving force in product development. Software suppliers put great effort into enhancements, by adding new capabilities and increasing performance on modeling, process and solver side. While such tools are generally based on a single common platform, solution bundles are often provided to cater for certain functional or performance aspects, while industry knowledge and best practices are provided to users in application verticals. These improvements should allow 3D simulation or 3D CAE to keep pace with ever shorter product design cycles. = Establishing a strong coupling between 1D simulation, 3D simulation and controls engineering = As the closed-loop systems-driven product development approach requires concurrent development of the mechanical system and controls, strong links must exist between 1D simulation, 3D simulation and control algorithm development. Software suppliers achieve this through offering co-simulation capabilities for :de:Model in the Loop (MiL), Software- in-the-Loop (SiL) and Hardware-in-the-Loop (HiL) processes.  Model-in-the- Loop  Already when evaluating potential architectures, 1D simulation should be combined with models of control software, as the electronic control unit (ECU) will play a crucial role in achieving and maintaining the right balance between functional performance aspects when the product will operate. During this phase, engineers cascade down the design objectives to precise targets for subsystems and components. They use multi-domain optimization and design trade-off techniques. The controls need to be included in this process. By combining them with the system models in MiL simulations, potential algorithms can be validated and selected. In practice, MiL involves co- simulation between virtual controls from dedicated controller modeling software and scalable 1D models of the multi-physical system. This provides the right combination of accuracy and calculation speed for investigation of concepts and strategies, as well as controllability assessment.  Software- in-the-Loop  After the conceptual control strategy has been decided, the control software is further developed while constantly taking the overall global system functionality into consideration. The controller modeling software can generate new embedded C-code and integrate it in possible legacy C-code for further testing and refinement. Using SiL validation on a global, full-system multi-domain model helps anticipate the conversion from floating point to fixed point after the code is integrated in the hardware, and refine gain scheduling when the code action needs to be adjusted to operating conditions. SiL is a closed-loop simulation process to virtually verify, refine and validate the controller in its operational environment, and includes detailed 1D and/or 3D simulation models.  Hardware-in-the-Loop  During the final stages of controls development, when the production code is integrated in the ECU hardware, engineers further verify and validate using extensive and automated HiL simulation. The real ECU hardware is combined with a downsized version of the multi-domain global system model, running in real time. This HiL approach allows engineers to complete upfront system and software troubleshooting to limit the total testing and calibration time and cost on the actual product prototype. During HiL simulation, the engineers verify if regulation, security and failure tests on the final product can happen without risk. They investigate interaction between several ECUs if required. And they make sure that the software is robust and provides quality functionality under every circumstance. When replacing the global system model running in real-time with a more detailed version, engineers can also include pre-calibration in the process. These detailed models are usually available anyway since controls development happens in parallel to global system development. = Closely aligning simulation with physical testing = Evolving from verification and validation to predictive engineering analytics means that the design process has to become more simulation-driven. Physical testing remains a crucial part of that process, both for validation of simulation results as well as for the testing of final prototypes, which would always be required prior to product sign-off. The scale of this task will become even bigger than before, as more conditions and parameters combinations will need to be tested, in a more integrated and complex measurement system that can combine multiple physical aspects, as well as control systems. Besides, also in other development stages, combining test and simulation in a well aligned process will be essential for successful predictive engineering analytics.  Increasing realism of simulation models  Modal testing or experimental modal analysis (EMA) was already essential in verification and validation of pure mechanical systems. It is a well-established technology that has been used for many applications, such as structural dynamics, vibro- acoustics, vibration fatigue analysis, and more, often to improve finite element models through correlation analysis and model updating. The context was however very often trouble-shooting. As part of predictive engineering analytics, modal testing has to evolve, delivering results that increase simulation realism and handle the multi-physical nature of the modern, complex products. Testing has to help to define realistic model parameters, boundary conditions and loads. Besides mechanical parameters, different quantities need to be measured. And testing also needs to be capable to validate multi-body models and 1D multi-physical simulation models. In general a whole new range of testing capabilities (some modal-based, some not) in support of simulation becomes important, and much earlier in the development cycle than before.  Using simulation for more efficient testing  As the number of parameters and their mutual interaction explodes in complex products, testing efficiency is crucial, both in terms of instrumentation and definition of critical test cases. A good alignment between test and simulation can greatly reduce the total test effort and boost productivity. Simulation can help to analyze upfront which locations and parameters can be more effective to measure a certain objective. And it also allows to investigate the coupling between certain parameters, so that the amount of sensors and test conditions can be minimized. On top of that, simulation can be used to derive certain parameters that cannot be measured directly. Here again, a close alignment between simulation and testing activities is a must. Especially 1D simulation models can open the door to a large number of new parameters that cannot directly accessed with sensors.  Creating hybrid models  As complex products are in fact combinations of subsystems which are not necessarily concurrently developed, systems and subsystems development requires ever more often setups that include partially hardware, partially simulation models and partially measurement input. These hybrid modeling techniques will allow realistic real- time evaluation of system behavior very early in the development cycle. Obviously this requires dedicated technologies as a very good alignment between simulation (both 1D and 3D) and physical testing. = Tightly integrating 1D and 3D CAE, as well as testing in the complete product lifecycle management process = Tomorrow's products will live a life after delivery. They will include predictive functionalities based on system models, adapt to their environment, feed information back to design, and more. From this perspective, design and engineering are more than turning an idea into a product. They are an essential part of the digital thread through the entire product value chain, from requirements definition to product in use. Closing the loop between design and engineering on one hand, and product in use on the other, requires that all steps are tightly integrated in a product lifecycle management software environment. Only this can enable traceability between requirements, functional analysis and performance verification, as well as analytics of use data in support of design. It will allow models to become digital twins of the actual product. They remain in-sync, undergoing the same parameter changes and adapting to the real operational environment.

She was a Film Curator at Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania from 1970 to 1975 and interim director of Film in the Cities in Minneapolis, Minnesota, from 1978 to 1979. She also served as Director of the Bush Foundation for Artist Fellowships from 1980 to 1996 and was a consultant for the Pew Charitable Trusts, The MacArthur Foundation, the Herb Foundation, and the Leeway Foundation.  Early life  Dixon was born in Seattle, Washington, to Fred C. Foy and Elizabeth Hamilton Foy. She was one of three children. Her father was Chief of Koppers Company in Pittsburgh, as well as chairman of the board of Trustees at Carnegie Mellon University and a Trustee of Carnegie Institute. Elizabeth Hamilton Foy was a member of the Women's Committee at Carnegie Institute. Dixon studied art at Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University), Bennington College, and Chatham College (now Chatham University).  Career  In the 1960s, Dixon received a small hand-held movie camera from her father-in-law and began making films, which she later called \\"film poems.\\" She became interested in learning about film. Influenced by Jonas Mekas' writing in The Village Voice, she became fascinated by avant-garde film. She was working at the Carnegie Museum of Art and after much discussion and research, started the museum's film department. = Carnegie Museum of Art = Dixon was the founding curator of the Film Section, later known as the Section of Film and Video and the Department of Film and Video, at Carnegie Museum of Art from 1970 to 1975. Dixon and Director Leon Arkus proposed a film program at the museum in 1969 and screenings began in 1970. They founded the program with the purpose of \\"promoting a greater understanding and appreciation of film as an art form and the filmmaker as an artist,\\" and it was one of the first museum-based film programs in the country. It spurred film activity throughout the city and helped start other local film organizations such as Pittsburgh Filmmakers. The Film Section specialized in American experimental film and featured lectures and screenings with artists such as Stan Brakhage, Hollis Frampton, Gunvor Nelson, Robert Breer, Willard Maas and Marie Menken, James Broughton, Joel Singer, Ken Jacobs, Peter Kubelka, Paul Sharits, George Kuchar, Mike Kuchar, Roger Jacoby, Bruce Baillie, Storm de Hirsch, and Joyce Weiland. Dixon premiered the program on April 1, 1970 with a lecture and screening by Lithuanian-American filmmaker Jonas Mekas. While at Carnegie Museum of Art, Dixon also became heavily involved in the promotion of experimental film and filmmakers. Dixon and her crew featured several monthly series, including the History of Film Series and the Director's Series, both of which served as introductions to the medium.https://blog.cmoa.org/2014/10/program-notes- stewarding-media-artworks-into-the-future/ In 1973, she began the Film and Video Makers Travel Sheet (1973‚Äì1987), a monthly circular that CMOA distributed to alternative cinemas, museums, media centers, and universities across the country. It listed contact information and screening/lecture dates and locations for film and video makers. The Travel Sheet made it possible for filmmakers to book additional screenings and in-person presentations, which became primary sources of income, exposure, and dialogue for artists during this early period of new media's institutionalization. Later that year, she toured Europe as part of a United States Information Agency (USIA) funded program to showcase the arts. She toured with three films by artist Stan Brakhage: eyes (1971), Deus Ex (1971), and The Act of Seeing with One's Own Eyes (1971). Titled collectively the \\"Pittsburgh Trilogy,\\" these films feature footage shot in Pittsburgh at various local institutions including the Pittsburgh Police and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). She also co-founded the Filmmakers Preview Network in 1975 and was a board member of Pittsburgh Filmmakers. Dixon left Carnegie Museum of Art in 1975. Later in 1975, Dixon left the film department and William Judson, a film professor at the University of Pittsburgh, succeeded her as curator. Dixon taught at the University of Colorado Boulder the next year until moving to Minnesota. = Minneapolis = In 1978, she moved to St. Paul, Minnesota, to become interim director for Film in the Cities (FITC), a media arts center that screened independent films and trained young artists and filmmakers. While she was there she created Filmmakers Filming, a screening and workshop series with the Film In The Cities accompanying booklets that was co-presented by the Walker Art Center. In 1980, Dixon became the first director of the Bush Artist Fellowships at the Bush Foundation and supported artists from Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota in literature, visual arts, and performing arts.  Personal life  Sally Dixon was married to engineer John Dixon. They lived in Pittsburgh and had three sons, John Dixon II, Steve Dixon and Alexander (Zander) Dixon. Alexander Dixon became an award-winning chef at his restaurant in St Paul, MN named Zander. Sally and John Dixon divorced and she married her second husband, physicist Ricardo Bloch, who later became a photographer. Dixon died on November 5, 2019.

The chapel was built in 1623‚Äì36 after Prince Casimir (1458‚Äì1484) was canonized as saint. It was built and decorated in the Baroque style by Italian sculptors and architects commissioned by Sigismund III Vasa, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania. The centerpiece of the chapel is a faux marble altar which holds the silver sarcophagus with Casimir's remains and the painting Three-Handed St. Casimir. History Prince Casimir was the second oldest son of the King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania Casimir IV and Queen Elisabeth Habsburg of Hungary. After his elder brother Vladislaus was elected as King of Bohemia in 1471, Casimir became the heir apparent. However, he focused on devotion to God and became known for his piety. He became ill (most likely with tuberculosis) and died at the age of 25. Prince Casimir was buried in a crypt under a chapel that his father reserved for the royal family. He was the first burial in this chapel. It is located to the left of the entrance and is now known as the Wo≈Ç≈Çowicz Chapel after Bishop . Other family members buried in the chapel were Casimir's brother Alexander Jagiellon and two wives of Casimir's nephew Sigismund II Augustus. As Casimir's cult grew and he was his feast was approved by the pope in 1602, his remains were taken from the crypt and elevated to the altar in May 1604. The old small chapel did not suit the new function to house relics of a saint but no space could be found for a new chapel until Bishop Wo≈Ç≈Çowicz agreed to swap his chapel with the royal chapel in February 1624. The old Wo≈Ç≈Çowicz's chapel was demolished and construction started for the new Chapel of Saint Casimir. King Sigismund III Vasa financed the construction and hired Italian architect Costante Tencalla for the chapel's plan. The construction was finished in 1636 and the relics were solemnly translated by four bishops to the new chapel on 14 August 1634. Three-Handed St. Casimir Three-Handed St. Casimir is an anonymous painting of Saint Casmir which hangs above his silver sarcophagus in the chapel. It features Casimir with thee hands (he has two right hands that each hold a lily) and is considered miraculous. The legend has it that the painter wanted to alter the composition and painted the second right hand, but he could not cover the first right hand ‚Äì it kept reappearing. The legend was first recorded by Bernhard Leopold Tanner in 1689. However, a study of the painting under UV light and X-ray during restoration works in 1982‚Äì1985 revealed that both hands were painted at the same time and there is no evidence of attempts to cover one of them. Three hands is an unusual motif in religious art. Povilas Rƒóklaitis cited an example of Trojeruƒçica, an icon of the Eastern Orthodox Church, as a possible inspiration. The three hands are unique to this particular painting of Saint Casimir. While the figure of Saint Casimir was copied numerous times, the copies only have two hands. It is painted on a thin wooden plank. The overall composition is very similar to the woodcut published by papal legate Zacharias Ferreri in Casimir's first hagiography in 1521. The main differences are the third hand and that the woodcut is set outdoors, while the painting is set indoors. It is believed that the woodcut and the painting were completed around the same time based on a lost original. Possibly this lost original was a portrait completed while Casimir was still alive but lost during a fire in Vilnius Cathedral in 1530. The painting was touched up in 1594 as evidenced by an inscription in a Renaissance cartouche at the bottom which cites a line from Psalm 92: The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon. Likely at this time, the original pendant which is worn by Casimir and which depicted Madonna with child was replaced by the Order of the Golden Fleece. Saint Casimir did not receive the order and it was likely added to appease King Sigismund III Vasa. The order is also present in the cartouche outside the chapel which records information about its completion in 1636. Murals The Resurrection of Ursula The chapel has two expressive murals by Florentine artist Michelangelo Palloni completed during the restoration work in 1692. The Opening of the Coffin of St. Casimir measures and decorates the east wall. It depicts the opening of St. Casimir's coffin on August 16, 1604 during his canonization proceedings. The body in the coffin was found intact, 120 years after the burial. The saint is wearing a long red robe, decorated with stoat fur, and a ducal crown. Bishop , who wrote to Rome of a wonderful smell after the lid was lifted, has his hands raised to heaven in praise of the Lord. Kneeling at the head of the saint is Gregorius Swiecicki, the canon at Vilnius Cathedral chapter, who was entrusted with Casimir's canonization process. Jan Kazimierz Sapieha who commissioned the painting stands on the right; Virgin Mary and Saint Peter, dressed in clothes of the time, stand on the left. Around them are priests with long candles in their hands. The Resurrection of Ursula measures and decorates the west wall. It depicts the first known miracle of St. Casimir. After the death of a young girl Ursula, her father went to the coffin of the prince to pray for her and the girl miraculously resurrected. The artist skillfully depicts surprise and astonishment of the father, other relatives, and clergy. Sculptures of rulers One of the eight sculptures of rulers traditionally identified as John I Albert The chapel has eight sculptures of rulers that stand in marble niches in the four corners. At about in height, the sculptures are taller than life size. They are carved from wood and plated in silver. They were carved with particular attention to individualized details: attributes of power, clothes, facial details, hand gestures, and poses (they are turned a bit to the left or the right so they face the main altar better). The author, date of creation, and identity of the figures are unknown and are subject to speculation by art historians. The chapel originally had eight pure silver sculptures that measured about in height and that were melted during the Deluge (1655‚Äì1660), but they stood in the main altar. The marble niches were probably created in 1620s or 1630s but there is no mention that they had any sculptures in them until 1737 when an inventory listed eight wooden sculptures of kings and emperors. According to Marija Matu≈°akaitƒó, the sculptures are of late Baroque style and should be dated the second quarter of the 18th century. The first claims that the sculptures depict Polish kings were recorded in a 1828 report of canonical visitation and in a 1835 book on the history of Vilnius by . This theory of the Jagiellonian kings gained popularity and in 1878 the names were written in gilded letters on the postaments: W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço (Jogaila) (reigned 1386‚Äì1434), W≈Çadys≈Çaw of Varna (1434‚Äì1444), Casimir IV Jagiellon (1447‚Äì1492), Saint Casimir, John I Albert (1492‚Äì1501), Alexander Jagiellon (1501‚Äì1506), Sigismund I the Old (1507‚Äì1548), and Sigismund II Augustus (1548‚Äì1572). At some point, Lithuanian historiography replaced W≈Çadys≈Çaw of Varna with W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV Vasa (1632‚Äì1648). The writings since has disappeared, but these names are often cited. Not all researchers agree with the traditional identification. Already in 1840 J√≥zef Ignacy Kraszewski proposed that the sculptures depict royal saints but the sculptures have no symbols or attributes of sainthood. The sculptures are too detailed and personalized to depict abstract royals or saints. Matu≈°akaitƒó suggested that one of the sculptures depicts Vytautas, Grand Duke of Lithuania (1392‚Äì1430), and not W≈Çadys≈Çaw of Varna or W≈Çadys≈Çaw Vasa. Mindaugas Paknys noted that two sculptures wear imperial crowns (other researchers considered them grand ducal caps as they are visually very similar) and suggested that they depict Camimir's grandfather Albert II of Germany, elected but not crowned King of the Romans, and Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor, who raised orphaned Casimir's mother. According to Paknys, the other six sculptures depict Casimir's immediate family: grandfather W≈Çadys≈Çaw Jagie≈Ç≈Ço, father Casimir, and brothers Vladislaus, John Albert, Alexander, and Sigismund.

The woman is over a barrel, a dog and several buildings are of secondary importance in the picture. Expressionism is represented by the crooked trunk of the tree, the hunched woman and the uneven plowed farmland. The scene contains a mood of loneliness and sadness. The scenery is authentic, and it is assumed that the apple tree is in the family garden of the artist. The picture contains an autobiographical aspect, alluding to the hard life of the artist, suffering from ill health and financial difficulties.

He served as President of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh from 1929 to 1931 and was president of the Edinburgh Obstetrical Society. He chaired the Central Midwives Board of Scotland and was manager of Donaldson's School for the Deaf. In 1929 he was a founder member of the British (later Royal) College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. In 1899 he founded the Haig Ferguson Memorial Home for unmarried mothers to give birth without chastisement. It was originally called the Lauriston Home and was renamed following his death; it closed in 1974. Early life He was born on 18 December 1862, in the manse at Fossoway (now known as Crook of Devon), Perthshire, the son of Elizabeth Haig of Dollarfield and Rev. William Ferguson, the local minister.The Dollar Magazine, September 1915 He attended the Collegiate School in Edinburgh before entering the faculty of medicine of the University of Edinburgh. He graduated MB CM in 1884 and in the same year became a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons of England.  Medical career  He worked as a resident physician under Dr Claude Muirhead at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh (RIE) on Lauriston Place, and as resident physician at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh. He then became private assistant to the obstetrician Dr (later Sir) John Halliday Croom, which marked the start of his career in obstetrics and gynaecology. In 1887 Haig Ferguson became a Member of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh (MRCPE) and two years later he was elected a Fellow (FRCPE). This qualification was regarded as the most appropriate for obstetricians at this time, but it was also advantageous to Haig Ferguson as he conducted a large general practice in addition to his developing obstetric practice. In 1890 he obtained from the University of Edinburgh the degree of Doctor of Medicine (MD) with honours. From 1896 he was Assistant Gynaecologist at theRIE. In 1898 he was appointed gynaecologist to Leith Hospital and assistant physician to the Edinburgh Royal Maternity Hospital one year later. Realising that gynaecology was becoming increasingly surgical in its practice and in order to establish his surgical credentials he obtained the Fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh by examination in 1902 at the age of forty. During this period he taught obstetrics and gynaecology in the extramural School of Medicine of the Edinburgh Royal Colleges. In 1906 Haig Ferguson was appointed assistant gynaecologist to the RIE. During this time, in addition to his RIE practice he served on the governing bodies of the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Donaldson‚Äôs Hospital, Merchiston Castle School and the Queen‚Äôs Institute of District Nursing. His single most important public service was as a member of the Central Midwives Board for Scotland, acting as its chairman for 13 years. In 1919 he became gynaecologist in charge of wards in the RIE. .One lasting contribution to obstetrics was the invention of the obstetric forceps which bear his name. He described these and their use in 1926. These are described as mid-cavity forceps and are still used in the 21st century. They remained available for purchase in 2019. In 1928/9 he conducted an extended exchange of correspondence with the Russian gynaecologist Vasily Stroganov in Leningrad. These concerned translation of Stroganov‚Äôs book The Improved Prophylactic Method in the Treatment of Eclampsia (published New York, 1930). He retired in 1927. The grave of James Haig Ferguson, Dean Cemetery, Edinburgh  Awards and honours  In 1904 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Sir William Turner, Alexander Crum Brown, Sir Patrick Heron Watson (his father-in-law), and Sir John Halliday Croom. He was president of the Edinburgh Obstetrical Society and in 1929 was elected president of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. The University of Edinburgh awarded him the Honorary degree of Doctor of Laws (LLD)., Family and later life In 1889 he married Penelope Gordon Watson (1863-1944), daughter of Patrick Heron Watson. They had two sons , William Haig Ferguson (1891-1928) Patrick Haig W. Ferguson (1898- ) , and three daughters, Elizabeth Barbara Ferguson (1893-), Isobel C.

Little is known about the church's commission, design or early history. It is believed to have been built when the town was of strategic importance to the Christian kings of Castile in their defence against Moorish invaders; the church is situated on an imposing hill below a fortified castle. By the 19th century the church was long abandoned and in disrepair. In the late 1940s, the apse was moved and reconstructed in The Cloisters of New York City. This transfer involved the shipping of almost 3,300 blocks of stone from Spain to New York. The acquisition followed three decades of complex negotiation and diplomacy between the Spanish church and both countries' art historical hierarchies and governments. The apse was eventually exchanged in a complex deal that involved the gifting by New York of six frescoes from the San Baudelio de Berlanga to the Prado Museum, on an equally long term loan. Today the apse is situated in the Cloisters' Fuentidue√±a hall, the museum's largest room.Rorimer, 267 Apse View, with altar and crucifix The apse measures 919.5 √ó 749.3 √ó 843.3 cm. It consists of a broad arch leading to a barrel vault and culminating in a half dome.Young, 14 The exterior wall holds three small windows,Wixom, 36 narrow and stilted, but designed to let in as much light as possible. The windows were originally set within imposing fortress walls; according to the art historian Bonnie Young \\"these small windows and the massive, fortress-like walls contribute to the feeling of austerity that is typical of Romanesque churches.\\" The supporting piers show three large figures. Saint Martin of Tours (c. 316‚Äì397), patron saint of the church is on the left. On the right is the angel Gabriel, in the act of Annunciation to the Virgin. The capital above the Annunciation shows a scene from the Nativity.\\"Apse from San Mart√≠n at Fuentidue√±a\\". Metropolitan Museum of Art. Retrieved 2 May 2016 Below the triumphal arch are two columns whose capitals depict scenes from the Adoration of the Magi on the left, and Daniel in the lions' den to the right.Wixom, 38 The capitals of the blind arcades contain a variety of fantastical creatures. The moldings are carved in billet and floral patterns. The walls are lined by a number of niches, \\"oddly shaped\\" according to Young, but probably placed to rest liturgical implements for mass. The apse was built from over 3,300 individual stone blocks, mostly sandstone and limestone,Barnet, 36 which were shipped to New York in 839 individual crates.\\"Monumental Moving Job\\". New York: Life Magazine, 20 Oct 1961. It was such a major and large installation into the Cloisters that it necessitated a complete refurbishment of the former \\"Special Exhibition Room\\". It was opening to the public in 1961, seven years after the transfer, its re-installation was a major and groundbreaking innovative undertaking. The new space seeks to emulate a single aisle nave.Barnet, 38 The capitals supporting the arch portray the Adoration of the Magi and Daniel in the lions' den. Its piers contain the figures of Saint Martin of Tours on the left and the angel Gabriel announcing to The Virgin on the right. The Fuentidue√±a room includes a number of other, mostly contemporary medieval art works set within the Fuentidue√±a Apse. They include, in its dome, a large fresco c. 1130‚Äì50, from the Spanish Church of Sant Joan de Tred√≤s, in its colorisation resembling a Byzantine mosaic and is dedicated to the ideal of Mary as the mother of God.Young, 17 Hanging within the apse is a c. 1150‚Äì1200 crucifix from the convent of St. Clara at Astudillo. Ancillary objects Crucifix, c 1150‚Äì1200. Spanish.

Metropolitan Museum of Art. Retrieved 2 May 2016 The cross is 178 cm high and 260 cm wide, and believed to originate from the convent of St Clara at Astudillo, near Palencia, in north-western Spain, though records are unclear and that is contested.Wixom, 39 The cross seems designed to hang above an altarpiece. Its reverse contains a depiction of the Agnus Dei (\\"lamb of God\\"), decorated with red and blue foliage at its frames. Acquisition In the early 1930s, the philanthropist John D. Rockefeller Jr., who had commissioned The Cloisters, financed the Metropolitan Museum of Art to acquire a number of Medieval architectural elements from Europe for incorporation into the building. Representatives were sent to Europe, mostly to France, to find an apse that might be suitable, with the current one from the San Mart√≠n Church, Fuentidue√±a identified in 1931, shortly after it had been declared a Spanish National Monument. However, both the Catholic church and the Spanish State claimed ownership of the building and site, and no agreement could be made for acquisition.Rorimer, 265 There are no surviving records of its original construction. It was built in the mid 12th century, when the town was of strategic importance to the Kingdom of Castile, then defending against the Moors; it is situated on a hill, somewhat imposingly, and just below a castle, for which it probably served as its chapel. The church was long abandoned and in ruin at the time, with only the apse remaining in relatively good condition. It was roofless, and as a result had suffering deterioration over the centuries. Its interior was at the time being used as a modern cemetery. No illustrations of its interior existed until 1928, when the American art historian and medievalist Arthur Kingsley Porter reproduced two photographs of some of the sculptured figures in his \\"Spanish Romanesque Sculpture\\". Exterior of the Fuentidue√±a room The exchange was looked upon more favorably by the Spanish 12 years later, when again approached by the Metropolitan, who argued that the apse would be better conserved in a roofed building. During the negotiations, the Spanish were represented by Francisco Javier S√°nchez Cant√≥n (later director of the Prado), and the archaeologist and historian Manuel G√≥mez-Moreno Mart√≠nez. The Metropolitan assured the citizens of Fuentidue√±a by promising to pay for the reinforcement of the local parish church of San Miguel, and to rebuild its tower, which was then also in disrepair, and threatening to fall. After years of negotiation, diplomacy and wide consultation, including with the Council of Minister of Spanish Government, the Bishop of Segovia and the Fine arts Academy of San Fernando, in 1957 the Council of Ministers sanctioned the loan, on five conditions which obligated the Metropolitan to: #Purchase six frescoes from the San Baudelio de Berlanga, to be loaned to the Prado. The frescoes included \\"two scenes from the chase, the bear, the elephant, the decorative panel with eagles, and the warrior with shield\\" #Pay for the cataloging of all the \\"drawings and forms\\", and for taking down, packing and preparing for shipment of the stones #Fund the reconstruction of the San Miguel church #Fund the Ayuntamiento de Fuentidue√±a's upkeep of the cemetery, and other purposes #Fund the shipment to New York, and its reconstruction there, including the placing of a roof over the apse, and the treatment of damaged stonework.

In 2015, more than 1,400 people received support from the trust. History Edith Cavell was executed in 1915 during the First World War by a German firing squad. A year after her death The Lancet published a letter from her sister, who wrote to say Edith \\"had long cherished the idea of establishing homes of rest for nurses.\\" An appeal was set up, with the Edith Cavell Homes of Rest for Nurses registered as a war charity. By July 1918 Queen Alexandra had become the patron. The Daily Telegraph and the Daily Mirror launched a national appeal for funds in her memory. The appeal by the newspapers raised ¬£12,500. By 1919, an Edith Cavell Home of Rest in Richmond was up and running. In 1921, administration of the Edith Cavell Homes of Rest for Nurses transferred to Nation's Fund for Nurses.

Background She was born in Haifa to Persian parents. She was the great-granddaughter of Bah√° ºu'll√°h, the prophet of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, although she was not a member of the Bah√° º√≠ Community. Maliheh Afnan moved to Beirut with her family in 1949. She received a BA from the American University of Beirut and a MA in Fine Arts from the Corcoran School of the Arts and Design in Washington, D.C. Afnan lived in Kuwait from 1963 to 1966, in Beirut from 1966 to 1974 and in Paris from 1974 until 1997, when she moved to London. Afnan's work has been shown primarily in France and in London. Her first solo show, in a Basel gallery in 1971, was organized by the American artist Mark Tobey. Her work is included in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, the British Museum in London, the Written Art Collection in Germany, the Institut du Monde Arabe in Paris and the BAII Bank Collection in Paris. She died in London at the age of 80.  Work  As a child, Afnan was fascinated by written language and calligraphy. Her own mail came to her home in three languages- Arabic, English, and Hebrew. However, at the time, she couldn‚Äôt read or write, and would instead fill pages with invented writing. This trend continued into her present works, where imagined writing and numbers are always present -- even in the landscapes.\\"Maliheh Afnan: Traces, Faces, and Places.\\" Interview by Rose Issa. February 14, 2014. ‚ÄúI love looking at scripts,‚Äù She said. ‚ÄúThey excite me visually and excite me even further when I can‚Äôt read then because then it‚Äôs so much more mysterious and they could be so many other things, rather than some banal statement.‚Äù Later in life, she pulled more inspiration from Mark Tobey, who worked in abstract script. He mentored her while she visited Switzerland. During the Lebanese Civil War, she ‚Äútook a blowtorch to‚Äù her art. She says her work is composed of traces of the past -- not just hers, but the past of her family and predecessors as well. Her work is mostly done on paper, with palettes composed of browns, blacks, reds and browns. People have compared it to ancient scrolls and tablature. She pulled from a variety of influences, likely due to her upbringing in middle eastern culture and her education and later life in the western world. The art that brought her into the spotlight of the art world was her series entitled Veiled. After 9/11, Veiled drew from the stereotype of what Persian women looked like, due to the veils they would wear. Afnan took the veil and turned it into a different type of veil. Her Veiled series focuses on the non physical veils all humans have inside of themselves: ‚ÄúVeiled emotions, veiled threats, veiled feelings.‚Äù The material Afnan used for the veils over top of her works was medical gauze from the pharmacy. She took the gauze and colored it in blacks and browns, laying it over script, sometimes even making new forms with it.Mirrors to Windows: The Artist As Woman. Directed by Susan Steinberg. Performed by Maliheh Afnan. England: SDS Productions, 2015. Afnan talked about her work as having layers, and enjoyed the idea of the ‚Äúlayers‚Äù of life showing themselves in her work. She demonstrated her pieces having the layers of old civilizations, and said her layers of color are similar to layers of the sun lain over the paper. While she isn‚Äôt as known for them, Afnan also worked with plaster reliefs. She would create a mold and fill it with plaster, removing it once it is dry. She painted over the plaster using ‚Äúearth colors, burnt, rust colors.‚Äù She also created what one might call portraits, instead calling them personages. While portraits have specific models, hers are not of any person in particular. She referred to them as amalgamations of people she has known, people she has seen, and people she has imagined. Afnan rejected labels like ‚ÄúMiddle Eastern Artist‚Äù and ‚ÄúFemale Artist,‚Äù insisting those are just things that happen to be true. She believed that if instead of focusing on what makes people different, we should focus on our ‚Äúcommon denominator‚Äù of humanity, and that the world would be better for it. She also expressed her love for accidents. Afnan said that she never planned her work ahead of time, and said ‚ÄúOften the accident is much more profound than what you are planning to do and what you are doing.\\" A story she told in accordance with this is one about an old plaster relief -- her old cat, while she was away, knocked over one of her plaster tablets. When she glued it back together, she discovered it looked ‚Äú10 times better‚Äù than the original. This is hand in hand with her desire to see the funny side in everything. ‚ÄúEven the most terrible tragedies have a funny side,‚Äù she said. She believed it was the humor of tragic situations that kept things from getting too hopeless, no matter the situation. Afnan also expressed the belief that it is important to stick to your personal principles.

Espa√±a Art√≠stica y Monumental was one of the most beautiful works in this genre works along Espa√±a pintoresca y art√≠stica (Francisco de Paula Van Halen) and Recuerdos y bellezas de Espa√±a (Francisco Javier Parcerisa with Jos√© Mar√≠a Quadrado). Most of the illustrated plates were done by Villaamil, many of them drawn from his own paintings; in these cases the illustration included his signature at the bottom ¬´¬ª. Other artists also contributed including his brother Juan, Valent√≠n Carderera, Valeriano Dominguez Becquer, and Cecilio Pizarro. Some parts of the work was created from original drawings purchased from other artists. In some cases the author's name is recorded on the illustration, else it is simply reads ¬´G. P√©rez de Villaamil lo dirigi√≥¬ª. This happened to Valentin Cardedera's illustration causing him to write a letter of complaint to Villaamil: Description The whole work has a romantic tinge in line with contemporary European works. The illustrations echoed P√©rez Villamil's style which celebrated a romantic medieval aspect. The Paris publishing house Hauser published the work between 1842 and 1850 in three volumes - around twenty French and one Spanish lithographer worked on the plates. Despite the variety of authors and lithographers whole had a consistent style thanks to the good direction P√©rez Villamil with the lithographers allowed to used interpretive licenses when working from the originals.. The work contains 44 views of Toledo, 19 of Burgos, as well as illustrations of various places of Castile, Aragon, Andalusia, the Basque Country, Navarre, and Galicia. The choice was arbitrary and did not represent all regions of Spain.

Youngberg Trustees Distinguished Professor in the Department of Economics at The Ohio State University, where he was awarded the 2014 Alumni Award for Distinguished Teaching, and a Research Associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research. In 2019, he was the inaugural North Hall Economics Professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara. In 2014, he was the youngest-ever president of the National Economic Association. His research mainly focuses on economic history, including studies of African American migration, economic analysis of illegal markets, the economics of marriage transfers, and measures of historical living standards. Life Logan comes from an African-American family in St. Paul, Minnesota, with roots in the sharecropping economy of the southern United States. He received his B.S. in economics from the University of Wisconsin, Madison in 1999 as a Chancellor's Scholar, M.A. degrees in economics and demography from the University of California, Berkeley in 2003, and his PhD in economics from the University of California, Berkeley in 2004. He was awarded tenure as a professor of economics at The Ohio State University at the age of 32. He has held visiting positions at Princeton University's Center for Health and Well-Being and was a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Scholar in Health Policy Research at the University of Michigan. Outside of his university positions, he serves on the board of a network of charter schools, and is active in Columbus-area HIV prevention organizations. Research Logan specializes in economic history, economic demography and applied microeconomics. His research in economic history concerns the development of living standards measures to assess how the human condition has changed over time. He applies techniques of contemporary living standard measurements to the past to derive consistent estimates of well-being over time. Much of his historical work uses historical household surveys, but also includes some new data to examine area such as the returns to education in the early twentieth century, the formation of tastes, and the allocation of resources within the household. In work with John Parman, he showed that there was an increase in racial segregation in all areas of the United States from 1880-1940‚Äîincluding in rural areas. His economic demography research agenda includes a variety of projects. In one project, with Raj Arunachalam, he examines dowries in South Asia to see if the purpose of dowry has changed over time. In another project, with Manisha Shah and Chih-Sheng Hsieh, he studies the economic, social and health implications of male sex work. This work examines the value of information in this illegal market, uses econometric techniques to quantitatively test sociological theories of gender and masculinity, and looks at the role of public health in causing decreases in disease transmission among these men. Logan has also worked on the economics of sports with Rodney J. Andrews, Kyle J. Kain, and Michael J. Sinkey. He has looked at bias in the college football betting market, deriving stronger tests for the use of the betting market as a prediction market, and testing for behavioral biases in college football poll rankings. In his presidential address to the NEA, Logan used records from his own family to talk about productivity and living standards in the Jim crow era in the American South, arguing for a greater role of qualitative research in driving the focus of empirical study. =Selected works=  *  References   External links  * CSMGEP Profiles: Trevon Logan, An Economist Who Profits From the Past * University of Wisconsin Alumni Award Profile: Trevon Logan ‚Äô99 Category:University of California, Berkeley alumni Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Ohio State University faculty Category:University of California, Santa Barbara faculty Category:Economic historians Category:University of Wisconsin-Madison alumni Category:American economists Category:African-American economists ","title":"Trevon Logan"},{"id":"50400371","text":"False Advertising are a British three-piece alternative rock group from Manchester and Oxford, England.

Allokotosauria was first described and named when a new monophyletic grouping of specialized herbivorous archosauromorphs was recovered by Sterling J. Nesbitt, John J. Flynn, Adam C. Pritchard, J. Michael Parrish, Lovasoa Ranivoharimanana and Andr√© R. Wyss in 2015. The name Allokotosauria is derived from Greek meaning \\"strange reptiles\\" in reference to unexpected grouping of early archosauromorph with a high disparity of features typically associated with herbivory. Nesbitt et al. (2015) defined the group as a stem-based taxon containing Azendohsaurus madagaskarensis and Trilophosaurus buettneri and all taxa more closely related to them than to Tanystropheus longobardicus, Proterosuchus fergusi, Protorosaurus speneri or Rhynchosaurus articeps. Therefore, Allokotosauria includes the families Azendohsauridae and Trilophosauridae by definition, as well as the potentially more basal Pamelaria which is closer to them than to other early archosauromorphs. Pamelaria is the earliest known allokotosaur, dating to the Anisian of India. Azendohsauridae is currently represented by a single genus Azendohsaurus known from the Ladinian to Carnian of Africa, while trilophosaurids are mostly known from the Carnian to Norian stages of North America, England and potentially European Russia, though one member of the latter group, Variodens inopinatus, is known from Rhaetian. According to studies of Arctosaurus material from Cameron Island in Canada, the latter may have been an allokotosaurian because of the similarities with Azendohsaurus due to the presence of a posterior ridge from the centrum to the diapophyses which extends from the diapophysis all the way to the posterior ventrolateral corner of the centrum. This ridge overhangs a deep groove in the lateral surface of the centrum. Allokotosauria is most notably characterized by wrinkled side surface of orbital border of the frontal bone, expanded and hooked quadrate bone head on the posterior side, and a prominent tubercle developed above to the glenoid fossa of the scapula, although there are other unambiguous traits that differentiate it from other early archosauromorphs. Below is a cladogram showing the phylogenetic relationships of Allokotosauria within Archosauromorpha as recovered by Nesbitt et al. (2015). Ezcurra (2016) also recovered a highly supported Allokotosauria with the same topology (including only Pamelaria, Azendohsaurus madagaskarensis and Trilophosaurus buettneri in his analysis), but noted that Pamelaria is nearly as likely to represent a basal azendohsaurid instead. Sengupta et al. (2017) described a new azendohsaurid and recovered Pamelaria as an azendohsaurid.

Regularly commissioned and performed by ensembles in the United States and abroad, her works include music for orchestra, chorus, soloists, chamber ensembles, dance, film and multimedia collaborations.  Biography  Clearfield was born on August 29, 1960 in Philadelphia, PA, and grew up in the local Main Line suburb of Bala-Cynwyd. Her parents loved music and often played chamber music in the living room. Clearfield started playing piano at age 5 and later played flute and timpani in the school bands and orchestras at Cynwyd Elementary, Bala-Cynwyd Junior High and Lower Merion High School. She also played in rock, folk and world music groups. Her father is a physician and her mother a painter, and she has one brother. Clearfield took an interest to composition early on, arranging pop songs from the radio for voices, strings and percussion. Clearfield met her first \\"woman composer mentor,\\" Margaret Garwood, when she attended Muhlenberg College. Clearfield later went on to earn a M.M. in Piano from the Philadelphia College of Performing Arts (now the University of the Arts), and subsequently received a D.M.A. in Composition from Temple University, where her principal teacher was Maurice Wright. Clearfield is the founder and host, since 1986, of the Philadelphia Salon concert series, featuring contemporary, classical, jazz, world, electronic, multimedia, and spoken word arts. A meeting place for musicians of diverse styles, she curates these events in Philadelphia and around the US. She was the featured composer for the 2014 Women Composers Festival of Hartford. In 2016, she was awarded a Pew Fellowship. Compositional style Clearfield writes for opera, orchestra, chorus, chamber ensembles, dance and multimedia collaborations and has composed a number of large-scale cantatas. Her style is lyrical and rhythmically compelling, with lush harmonies and contrasting fields of texture and sound color. Her work on the Golem Psalms includes the practice of gematria which she embeds into the composition. Clearfield's piece, Unremembered Wings, is based on the poetry of Pablo Naruda.

He sailed on the 1835‚Äì42 voyage by HMS Sulphur to explore the Pacific Ocean, and edited the natural history reports of that expedition.  Biography  Hinds was born at Aldermaston on 11 October 1811, the eldest child of Richard Hinds, a surgeon in the Royal Navy, and his wife, Susannah (nƒóe Ridley).Aldermaston C. of E. parish registers. In 1829, he began studying at St Bartholomew's Hospital. In 1830, he matriculated at London University, where he gained an honours degree. He is reported to have been awarded the Gold Medal of the Worshipful Society of Apothecaries for botany, but no record of that seems to have survived. In 1833, he was accepted as a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons. On 28 February 1835, he joined the Royal Navy with the rank of Assistant Surgeon, and was appointed to the Royal Naval Hospital, Haslar. On 26 September 1835, he was appointed surgeon in HMS Sulphur. That ship was to be employed as a hydrographic surveying vessel in the Pacific Ocean, and her officers were chosen for their scientific abilities, particularly in natural history. On 24 December 1835, she sailed from Plymouth, to circumnavigate the globe in the westerly direction; on 19 July 1842, she arrived again in England, at Spithead. On 6 August 1842, he was appointed to HMY William & Mary, with the duty of organising the natural history specimens acquired during Sulphur's voyage. During JanuaryFebruary 1841, he had collected plants at Hong Kong; the first such collection to be brought to England. In 1842, he published a paper entitled \\"Remarks on the Physical Aspect, Climate and Vegetation of Hong Kong, China\\" in Sir William Hooker's London Journal of Botany. It was accompanied by a paper by the botanist George Bentham identifying, and in some cases describing, almost 140 species of plant. He published many articles in Hooker's Annals of Natural History. On 31 January 1843, he was promoted Surgeon. In 1843, Captain Edward Belcher, commander of Sulphur, published a two-volume report entitled Narrative of a Voyage Round the World. It included a contribution by Hinds, published separately in 1843 under the title The Regions of Vegetation, Being an Analysis of the Distribution of Vegetable Forms over the Surface of the Globe in Connection with Climate and Physical Agents. He was appointed by the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to help prepare reports on the natural history of Sulphurs voyagetowards the expense of which they contributed ¬£500. Those reports were published in 1844 under his editorship as ' and The Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Sulphur. Two of the three volumes have no named author, and he may have written them. In 1844, he was nominated (by Sir William Barnett, Director-General of Naval Hospitals and Fleets) to be, and was elected as, Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons, as a representative for the Royal Navy. His health had been affected by fever suffered during naval service. On 23 January 1845, he received permission to go to Australia; on 31 January 1845, he was discharged from William & Mary; and on 19 May 1845, he was placed on the unfit list with a diagnosis of \\"phthisis\\" (possibly tuberculosis, possibly some other disease). He emigrated to Swan River, Western Australia;HMS Sulphur had visited Swan River in 1829. where on 25 May 1846 he died, at the age of 34.Perth Inquirer. 10 June 1846. page 2 During her voyage of 183542, Sulphur had continued earlier hydrographic and natural history surveys of the Pacific Ocean by the Royal Navy; notably that of 183136 by HMS Beagle, in which Charles Darwin had sailed as naturalist and Captain's companion.
