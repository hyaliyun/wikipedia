Recommendations are made to the Monarch of the United Kingdom, who has the sole authority to rescind an honour. Operations The committee is only convened at the request of the Prime Minister, under the chairmanship of the Head of the Home Civil Service. The committee conducts its business by correspondence, and only meets to confer about a decision where the probability is to rescind an honour. The committee only considers cases where an individual who has been honoured is judged to have brought the honours system into disrepute, including issues covering someone who: *has been found guilty by the courts of a criminal offence and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of three months or more *has been censured, struck off, etc. by the relevant professional or other regulatory authority for action or inaction which was directly relevant to the granting of the honours. If there is other compelling evidence that an individual has brought the honours system into disrepute, then it is open to the committee to consider such cases as well. The committee also considers matters of general policy regarding forfeiture. In 2009, Gordon Brown confirmed that the process remains as set out in 1994 by the then Prime Minister John Major in a written answer to the House of Commons: All decisions made by the committee are submitted to the Monarch through the Office of the Prime Minister. The subjects discussed by the Committee remain confidential at all times, until confirmed by the Monarch. Decisions on forfeiture are published in the London Gazette.

Composed in 1912‚Äì14, it premiered at the Paris Opera on 14 May 1914. Composition Hugo von Hofmannsthal first proposed the Josephslegende to Strauss as a Zwischenarbeit (interim work) between Ariadne auf Naxos and Die Frau ohne Schatten. Composition began in June 1912, but in a letter of 11 September Strauss confided that the work wasn't progressing as quickly as he expected: \\"The chaste Joseph himself isn't at all up my street, and if a thing bores me I find it difficult to set it to music. This God-seeker Joseph ‚Äì he's going to be a hell of an effort!\\" Strauss drew on earlier sketches for his abandoned ballet Die Insel Kythere and wrote for an outsized orchestra with exotic instrumental colouring including four harps, large and small cymbals, four pairs of castanets, heckelphone, and a contrabass clarinet. Instrumentation Josephslegende is scored for the following instruments: ;Woodwinds: :1 Piccolo :4 Flutes (3rd doubling 2nd Piccolo) :2 Oboes :1 Cor anglais (doubling 3rd Oboe) :1 Heckelphone :1 Clarinet in D :2 Clarinets in A :1 Bass Clarinet in A :1 Contrabass clarinet (doubled by either 2nd Clarinet or Clarinet in D) :3 Bassoons :1 Contrabassoon ;Brass: :6 Horns :4 Trumpets :4 Trombones :1 Tenor Tuba :1 Bass Tuba ;Percussion: :Timpani (2 players) :Glockenspiel :Xylophone :Large and small cymbals :Snare drum :Bass drum :Triangle :Tambourine :4 Castanets :Wind machine :4 Harps :Organ :Celesta :Piano ;Strings: :1st, 2nd, and 3rd Violins (10 players each) :1st and 2nd Violas (8 players each) :1st and 2nd Cellos (6 players each) :Double Basses Performance history Strauss in London, June 1914 to conduct the UK premiere of Josephslegende With Diaghilev as impresario, Nijinsky as choreographer and creator of the title role ‚Äì replaced after his marriage and fall from grace by Fokine and Massine ‚Äì costumes by L√©on Bakst and Alexandre Benois, scenic design after Veronese by Josep Maria Sert, and Strauss conducting the premiere, the initial run lasted seven performances. This was shortly followed by a further seven in London in June conducted by Richard Strauss (UK premiere 23 June) and Sir Thomas Beecham, who had loaned the money for the commission to Diaghilev. With the looming war, Strauss never received his fee of 6,000 francs. Symphonic fragment In 1947, Strauss prepared a symphonic fragment from Josephslegende for reduced orchestra. This was premiered in March 1949 in Cincinnati under Fritz Reiner.

Muneatsu was the second son of Date Munenaru, daimy≈ç of Uwajima Domain, and was adopted by Date Yoshikuni in March 1868 as his heir. At that time, he was given the Court rank of Junior Fourth, Lower Grade and courtesy titles of Sakon Daiyu and Jij≈´. Later that year, Sendai Domain and the ≈åuetsu Reppan D≈çmei were defeated in the Boshin War of the Meiji Restoration, and Yoshikuni resigned his offices and went into voluntary retirement and seclusion in Tokyo. The new Meiji government ordered that his fourth son, the two-year-old Date Munemoto become daimy≈ç of a much reduced Sendai Domain. In 1869, the office of daimy≈ç was eliminated by the new government, and Munemoto became Imperial Governor of Sendai: however, as he was still a small child, the government ordered that he be replaced by Muneatsu in 1870. Munemoto retained his position as the hereditary chieftain of the Date clan. Following the abolition of the han system in 1871, Muneatsu was sent by the Meiji government to England for studies. He remained in England for five years, returning to Japan in February 1875. In 1884, he set up his own household separate from the main Date clan, and on May 11, 1889 was granted the title of danshaku (baron) in the new kazoku peerage system. Starting in July 1890, he served for four terms in the House of Peers in the Diet of Japan. On June 20, 1900 he was advanced to Third Court Rank.

Positing that unreasonableness is not a human trait, but rather the result of environment (context and circumstances), the RPM attempts to define the environments/actions that foster reasonableness, defining three key areas that assist with this: model building, being effective, and meaningful action. The RPM was developed by environmental psychologists Stephen and Rachel Kaplan and integrates principles from environmental, cognitive, and evolutionary psychology.  Overview  RPM diagram ((C) 2011, Rachel Kaplan) The RPM is a psychological framework that posits human functioning is improved when the following three domains of informational needs are met: * Model building ‚Äì RPM posits that a central informational need is to build mental models (also known as cognitive maps) in order to function effectively in the world. It suggests that mental models help people recognize objects and circumstances, predict and evaluate possible future outcomes and decide on actions. * Being effective ‚Äì This focuses on helping people utilize knowledge effectively by developing the necessary skills, also maintaining a clear head in order to function effectively. * Meaningful action ‚Äì RPM suggests that people wish to use their skills to make a difference, meaning they wish to be listened to and be given opportunities to participate. RPM states that an environment or context supportive of informational needs can foster reasonable behavior that will \\"bring out the best in people\\". Conceptualizing reasonableness The use of the term reasonable in RPM has commonalities and differences with the colloquial use of the word. In RPM, reasonableness refers to the ways in which \\"one would hope people behave\\". The concept is partially conveyed by what it is not, unreasonable states such as incivility, aggression, irritability and impatience. Examples may also include \\"...demanding fairness for oneself while denying it to others, displaying intolerance and disrespect for others, willingness to harm or kill because of differences in beliefs, and attempting to extract the earth‚Äôs resources for personal gain without regard for the needs of future generations\\". = Comparison to theories on rationality = The RPM may be viewed as a contrary theory to rational man theory (also known as Homo Economicus) or related rational choice theory, in that it describes a landscape of mutual dependencies, such as the manner in which people treat one another. RPM assumes that information is often misunderstood, overwhelming, and unavailable. It also assumes that people are not interested in maximizing personal gain, but rather satisficing. RPM further asserts that people often have multiple concerns which cannot be reduced to a single monetary value. = Comparison to subjective well-being = Reasonableness shares some themes with subjective well-being, including emphasis on positive/negative affect and quality of life. However, whereas SWB addresses self-directed feelings, RPM also considers the contexts that foster civil behavior and improve relationships between people. Model building The world, as William James described it, is a \\"blooming buzzing confusion\\". Mental models are neural structures, made of neurons and synapses, that organize our experiences into a usable form and allow us to #recognize objects, situations, and other patterns, #predict possible future outcomes, #evaluate those outcomes offline, and #take appropriate action. In 1943, Kenneth Craik described these affordances: > \\"If the organism carries a ‚Äúsmall-scale model‚Äù of external reality and of > its own possible actions within its head, it is able to try out various > alternatives, conclude which is the best of them, react to future situations > before they arise, utilize the knowledge of past events in dealing with the > present and future, and in every way to react in a much fuller, easier, and > more competent manner to the emergencies which face it.\\" = Mechanisms of model building = Mental models are built through repetition, variation, and association. Experiencing something multiple times is said to lead to an internal representation. Experiencing sequences of things associates our internal representations in a mental map according to how those things occur in reality. Donald Hebb's rule put it as: Things that fire together, wire together. Being effective This refers to the skills needed over and above basic knowledge to accomplish goals and refers to a state of mind that is capable of attending to and managing information. Lack of clearheadedness is described within attention restoration theory, which states there are two attentional systems: one for attending to naturally fascinating stimuli and another that allows us to intentionally direct our attention. Richard Louv's notion of nature deficit disorder describes some of the symptoms associated with a younger generation who do not spend time outdoors. Meaningful action RPM's third domain argues that people have a desire to use their knowledge and skills to make a difference. Fewer people have work that is directly connected to their survival yet the evolutionary desire to make a difference remains. The inability to do so can lead to learned helplessness and feeling hopeless and alone in the face of seemingly insurmountable challenges. Such a state is not amenable to effective human functioning, yet there continues to be, as Kaplan describes, a \\"pervasive malaise of helplessness\\". Goldschmidt described what he termed The Human Career as: one in which humans are primarily seeking the respect of others\\". It is argued that, in participatory contexts, the most effective strategies are ones that help people feel like they can make a difference.

William \\"Bill\\" Oakley, Jr. (March 19, 1937 ‚Äì October 30, 2010)Denver Post was a theatrical producer-director-actor and seminal figure in the revival of early American theater, melodrama and vaudeville with theaters in Colorado and Missouri. Dubbed \\"Barnum of the Buttes\\" by The Denver Post, Oakley is best known for G. William Oakley's Heritage Square Opera House \\"Nostalgic Theater\\" adaptations of such classic melodrama as The Drunkard, The Streets of New York, and Sweeney Todd, literary works such as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Frankenstein, and Sherlock Holmes, and original works including Call of the Yukon. In his productions, Oakley was a champion of improvisation and audience participation. His productions also featured \\"vaudeville olio\\" variety numbers showcasing the musical and comedic talents of his repertory company interspersing jokes with modern-day spoofs ranging from Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet as houseflies to Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller\\". Oakley's Heritage Square Opera House in Golden, Colorado (1971‚Äì1988) and the historic Goldenrod Showboat at Laclede's Landing on the St. Louis Mississippi waterfront (1975‚Äì1985) became popular icons for his brand of theater.  Family background and early life  Oakley was born March 19, 1937 in Cherokee, Oklahoma to Eula Mae Hutson Oakley and George William Oakley Sr., an electrical engineer, and was raised in Oklahoma, Washington State and Colorado. He was graduated from Centennial High School, Pueblo in 1955 and moved to Denver in 1958 where he worked as a meter reader. In 1962 Oakley moved to Marin County, California. In 1962‚Äì63 he worked as a house parent at Sunny Hills Residential Treatment Center for Children in San Anselmo where he met Rayda Pomroy whom he married in 1963. Their sonTrace has made a career of acting and of directing theatre productions in Los Angeles, Colorado, Wyoming and on the East Coast. was born November 1963 in San Jose, California. In 1964 they moved to Pueblo, Colorado where Oakley attended Southern Colorado State College (now Colorado State University-Pueblo) and graduated in 1965 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Theater and Education. At CSU he met his mentor Dr. Dean Wenstrom who convinced him to try stage acting, which led to his first role as William of Normandy in Alfred, Lord Tennyson's Harold. Oakley taught theater and English at Loveland High School, Colorado from 1965 to 1968. His and Rayda's daughterRegan Oakley is a graduate of NYU and Columbia University. Her teaching career in drama includes the international schools in Frankfurt, Germany; Kiev, Ukraine and Tashkent, Uzbekistan. was born in Loveland in 1967. Oakley studied for his masters at Colorado State University in Ft. Collins and in 1969, completing his thesis on \\"The Theatrical History of Cripple Creek from 1891 to 1896\\". From 1967 to 1970 his career as a director and actor included Buckskin Joe in Ca√±on City, Colorado (1967); the Red Ram in Larimer Square, Denver (fall and winter 1969); the Oxford Hotel, Denver; and the Iron Springs Chateau in Manitou Springs, Colorado (1968, 1969, 1970) It was at the old West theme park, Buckskin Joe in Ca√±on City, Colorado (1967) where Oakley first developed his comic improvisation and audience participatory style of melodrama that would become his trademark. From 1967 to 1970 his career as a director and actor included Buckskin Joe, the Red Ram in Larimer Square, Denver (fall and winter 1969); the Oxford Hotel, Denver; and many of the performers would move on to the Iron Springs Chateau in Manitou Springs, Colorado (1968, 1969, 1970); and Estes Park, Colorado. Oakley's Heritage Square Opera House in Golden, Colorado (1971‚Äì1988) and the historic Goldenrod Showboat in St. Louis (1975‚Äì1984) became the most popular icons for his brand of theater.  Heritage Square Opera House in Golden Colorado (1971‚Äì1988)  In 1970, having built a reputation for his style of melodrama, vaudeville, ragtime and traditional jazz, the management at Heritage Square in Golden, Colorado sought after Oakley to bring his brand of comedy to Golden. Heritage Square is a replica of an old West town located in the Rocky Mountain foothills between the City of Golden and Town of Morrison, Colorado, just west of Denver. From 1971 to 1973 Oakley in partnership with his brother Donald Oakley ‚Äì in part financed by the sale of Don's car ‚Äì established the first 200-seat Heritage Square Opera House in the location of what later became the General Store. Co-Founder of their newly formed Gaslight Enterprises, Donald was the Executive Vice President in charge of business management. G.W. Oakley designed the building interior and wrote and directed the melodramas, usually derived from original Victorian-era melodrama scripts, and vaudeville \\"olio\\" reminiscent of Victorian-era variety shows in a format of jokes interspersed with musical and comedy performance. Melodramas were inspired with Oakley's style of comedy and improvisation for which he became known. The original repertory company included Oakley, who notoriously played the villain.The original repertory company included Oakley, Hartley Silver, Melinda Seeber Foster, Dick Jamison, Tim Fox, Margaret Mancinelli, Bob Moore and Bryan Foster, the latter who became ‚Äì along with his popular character \\"Toad\\" ‚Äì an Opera House favorite. The theater manager whom Oakley said he considered indispensable was Dave McCarty. Beer and wine were served during the show along with popcorn, which Oakley encouraged audience members to throw onstage at the villain during the show, the beginning of a long tradition. Oakley said his favorite part of the show as the Olio where he incorporated modern-day themes and movies such as a production of Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller\\" spoof on film noir. When starting rehearsal for a new show he said he looked for moments when people were funny and said \\"people don't always know when they're funny\\". In 1973 the Oakley brothers opened a new Opera House on an adjacent site of an unfinished storefront. He designed the new 350-seat, two-story venue top to bottom as a dinner-theater that operated under the imprimatur Gaslight Enterprises DBA G. William Oakley's Heritage Square Opera House. The theatre had 52 box seats in the balcony, with the main floor divided into the \\"pit\\" of some 70 seats in front of the stage, behind which were raked rows of long bench-like tables and chairs where people were served from a full bar throughout the show. Before the show a buffet dinner was served upstairs in a full dining room and adjoining piano-bar lounge while vintage silent films with live piano accompaniment were featured before the show in the theater. Oakley traditionally opened the show with announcements of birthdays and anniversaries in his popular comedy improvisational style. He introduced the hero, heroine and villain and primed the audience to respond on cue to their entrances during the show with a \\"Yay!\\", \\"Awww!\\", or \\"Boo!\\", which the crowd did with great enthusiasm. Opening night for \\"G. William Oakley's Heritage Square Opera House\\" was July 10, 1973. Oakley recounted everyone working to the last minute including his wife and Scenic Designer Rayda Oakley hanging wallpaper and painting. Although the doors for the bathrooms were not hung, among other things, Oakley insisted the show must go on for opening night and the entire audience was treated to complimentary dinner and show. The show was \\"Down the Black Canyon\\", the evening was a big hit and Oakley's Opera House was well on its way to making history in Colorado.Opening night original cast included Bryan Foster and T.J.Mullin; prominent cast members of the Opera House repertory company over the years included Sy Richardson, Terry Rhoads, Frank Oden, Gene Oden, Stuart Whitmore, Lynda Holly, AK Klimpke, Debbie Laurie, Doug Yetter, Debbie Yetter, Steve Leuthauser, Alex Crawford, DP Perkins, Laura Turnbull, Judith Lane, Dean Christopher, Dan Mueller, Brian Norber and Bren Eyestone. Oakley became sole proprietor of the theater in 1977 and managed the business until 1988. Today the theater is owned and operated as the Heritage Square Music Hall by T.J. Mullin who began as an actor for the 1973 opening night of the new Opera House and who later became a key figure in Opera House fame. Oakley's Heritage Square Opera House and Goldenrod Showboat employed hundreds of people from 1971 to 1988 and Oakley prided himself in knowing by name all his employees as well as their interests. Former employees routinely credit him for the training he provided and many of them continued on to Broadway and Hollywood in stage, movies and television. \\"From Hollywood to Broadway and across the US, performers and employees have attributed much of their success to G.William Oakley's recognition of their talent, to his perfectionism, his tutelage and direction.\\"  The Goldenrod Showboat  From 1975 to 1984 Oakley produced his \\"nostalgic theater\\" on the\\"GOLDENROD (Showboat)\\". National Historic Landmark summary listing. National Park Service then moored on the St. Louis waterfront beneath the Gateway Arch \\"Gateway to the West\\". The Goldenrod was managed by Gaslight-Goldenrod Associates, DBA G. William Oakley's Goldenrod Showboat. Gaslight-Goldenrod Associates was a combination of investors from Gaslight Enterprises aka the Heritage Square Opera House, and theater producer Frank Pierson and his business partner Don Franz of the St. Louis Ragtimers trio. Pierson and Franz had acquired and renovated the 1909 showboat after its destruction by a 1962 fire. Goldenrod Showboat became a designated U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1967. She was placed on the \\"Threatened Historical Landmarks\\" list in 2001. One of two remaining examples of the modern era of showboats that ended in the 1920s, the Goldenrod was the largest and most elaborately decorated of the showboats and believed by some historians to have been the inspiration for Edna Ferber's classic Show Boat. Under Oakley's direction the Goldenrod mirrored its sister theater in Colorado as dinner-theater that included a buffet dinner with piano entertainment, silent films with live piano accompaniment, the comedy melodrama and vaudeville olio repertory cast, and shared a traveling creative team and production crew with the Opera House in Colorado. Between the two locations, Oakley mounted 12 to 14 original productions each year.  Annual National Ragtime and Traditional Jazz Festival (Ragfest)  A lover and aficionado of ragtime and traditional jazz music, Oakley was a fan of the St. Louis Jazz Festival, which he acquired in 1975. Oakley produced the Annual National Ragtime and Traditional Jazz Festival from 1975 to 1984 with the Goldenrod as host of the week-long event that featured famed singer Pat Yankee and the Turk Murphy Jazz Band of San Francisco, Carol Leigh, Lew Green and the Original Salty Dogs of Chicago, a dozen other bands and score of solo musicians who entertained in the Goldenrod's theater and festival's adjoining barges. Thousands of people paid for admission to the many stages while others flocked along the levee to the \\"cheap seats\\" where they were able to enjoy the music free of charge. After leaving the Goldenrod in 1984 Oakley continued to produce the Annual National Ragtime and Traditional Jazz Festival in Heritage Square until 1987.  Broadway  Oakley's career also took him to New York City and Broadway. In 1979 Oakley worked as a comedic consultant with producers Ashton Springer and Frank Pierson for the musical Whoopee which played six months on Broadway. The revival of the 1928 Eddie Cantor vehicle Broadway musical started at the Goodspeed Theater Opera House in East Haddam, CT. Oakley later directed the show's national tour, which received rave notices throughout its nine-month run. Oakley also was an investor in the popular Torch Song Trilogy in 1982 when the show went to Broadway. Off- Broadway he produced Basin Street at the Henry Street Theater in 1983 with the famed Turk Murphy Jazz Band, singer Pat Yankee and Broadway actress Sandra Reaves-Phillips. In Denver the show was produced as Storyville and was the last mainstage production at Denver's Bonfils Memorial Theatre.  The Wynkoop Cabaret  In 1992‚Äì93 Bill Oakley partnered with Gail Spencer and John Hickenlooper in The Wynkoop Cabaret in Hickenlooper's popular Wynkoop Brewing Company, Denver's oldest micro-brewery-restaurant. Shows included Frank Ferrante in An Evening with Groucho as a one-man show sanctioned by Groucho Marx's son, Arthur Marx, for whom Ferrante played Groucho in his critically acclaimed Broadway show, Groucho: A Life in Revue. Also of note was the Rick and Ruby Rock and Roll Revival musical comedy directed by Bob Lacey and starring Monica Ganas, Rick Right and J. Raoul Brody, which enjoyed an extended run, and the musical revue Dawgs, a spoof of the Broadway shows Cats, by Milt Larson of Hollywood's Magic Castle fame.  Retirement  In retirement Oakley traveled extensively with his wife to Europe, Asia, Egypt, Canada, Latin America and throughout the U.S. He resided in Georgetown, Colorado and Daytona Beach, Florida. He became known for his gourmet culinary skills, and was very proud of serving for 12 years on the board of the John Tomay Memorial Library in Georgetown. Melodrama and humor was Oakley's forte in life and on stage. When asked, Oakley said, \\"I'd like to be remembered as Cary Grant with a martini.\\"  Rayda Oakley  Rayda Oakley was born in 1932 in Seattle, Washington to Raphael Pomroy and Irma Krupp. She was graduated with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Art from the University of Washington School of Art, earned her master's degree (MA) in Christian Education from the San Francisco Theological Seminary, and her Masters in Social Work (MSW) from the University of California at Berkeley. She also studied art in New York and in Red Rocks Community College in Golden, Colorado. In 1963 she worked as a social worker at Sunny Hills Residential Treatment Center for Children in San Anselmo, California, where she met G. William Oakley, Jr. They were married February 1963 in Sacramento, CA and moved to Pueblo, Colorado where she worked as a social worker in Colorado State Hospital (in 1991 the Colorado Department of Human Services psychiatric facility name was changed to Colorado Mental Health Institute at Pueblo). She continued social work from 1964 until 1998, taking about ten years (mid-1970s to 1980s) to focus solely on her art. As a social worker she worked for Bethesda Denver Mental Health Center; Adams County School District 50; and Jefferson County Public Schools. As a painter and mixed media artist, she designed the theatrical sets and scenery for the Heritage Square Opera House and the Goldenrod Showboat. Upon her retirement as a social worker in 1998, she returned full-time to painting. Her work is currently shown at the Majestic Gallery Idaho Springs, CO. Rayda Oakley's paintings and art works have been extensively exhibited and collected throughout the United States. Among collectors are House and Garden (HGTV), Kaiser Permanente Corporation, and Parkplace Corporation, Denver. She has participated in many national shows and has received numerous honors and awards.

About 540 species are known from Russia. The butterflies (mostly diurnal) and moths (mostly nocturnal) together make up the taxonomic order Lepidoptera. The history of lepidopterology in Russia is connected with the organization of the first Russian museum The Kunstkamera established by Peter the Great in 1714. In 1717, he purchased the collection of Albert Seba, a merchant from Amsterdam, for the new museum. In 1832 the Zoological Museum of the Imperial Academy of Sciences was separated as a distinct institution which in 1931 became the Zoological Institute of the USSR Academy of Sciences (since 1991 ‚Äî Russian Academy of Sciences). In 1859, the then director of the Zoological Museum, Johann Friedrich von Brandt was one of the founders of the Russian Entomological Society in 1859 and in St. Petersburg . Other founders were Karl Ernst von Baer, Ya. A. Kushakevich, Colonel Alexander Karlovich Manderstern, Alexander von Middendorff and Colonel of General Staff Victor Ivanovitsch Motschulsky. Another society founder was Ferdinand Morawitz. Eduard Brandt and Ferdinand Morawitz. Also important was the Moscow Society of Naturalists and increasingly the Russian Academy of Sciences and The Academy of Sciences of the USSR. From the mid-nineteenth century the main zoogeographic focus was on the Caucasus, Siberia and the Russian Far East. At the end of the nineteenth century the German entomologist Otto Staudinger financed collectors in the Far East of Russia. In the early twentieth century the results of all these endeavours were summarised in Die Gross-Schmetterlinge der Erde edited by Adalbert Seitz. From 1925 lepidopterology was organised by The Academy of Sciences of the USSR and lists titled USSR or SSR. In 1991 The Academy of Sciences of the USSR became once again the Russian Academy of Sciences.

He played in the National Football League for the Dallas Cowboys and Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He played college football at the University of Miami. Early years Sullivan attended St. Francis DeSales High School, where he was a three-year starter and was named All-Midwest as a senior. He accepted a football scholarship from the University of Miami where he was redshirted as a freshman. He played his first 2 years at left offensive guard, before being switched to left tackle as a junior. He started a school record 48 consecutive games (all of the games in his college career), despite dealing with different injuries, including the removal of a benign tumor near his left ear in 1989. Sullivan contributed to a 44-4 record, 2 National Championships (1987, 1989), and the first 36 contests of the 58-game NCAA record home winning streak. One of two players in school history to earn an NCAA Post-Graduate Scholarship (only 15 are awarded per year) and the only two-time winner of the CBS/Toyota Leadership Award. In 2009, he was inducted into the University of Miami Sports Hall of Fame. Professional career =Dallas Cowboys= Sullivan was selected in the sixth round (153rd overall) by the Dallas Cowboys in the 1991 NFL Draft, with the intention of playing him at offensive guard. He originally failed his physical but was later approved to participate in training camp. He was waived on August 26 and later re-signed to the practice squad. After being signed to the active roster, he was released on November 22 and re-signed to the practice squad. =Tampa Bay Buccaneers= In 1992, he signed as a free agent with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He played four years mainly as a back-up offensive lineman and on special teams. =Chicago Bears= On March 26, 1996, he was signed as a free agent by the Chicago Bears. He was released before the season started. Coaching career Sullivan coached at Western Michigan University, Cleveland Browns and the San Diego Chargers. He is currently coaching at the Tennessee Titans. He also helped four teams to Championships over the span of his coaching career in the European Federation of American Football.

It is native to Venezuela and northern Brazil, particularly the upper Orinoco and Rio Erer√™, a tributary of the Rio Negro. The adults grow to a maximum length of only 16 mm, making them one of the smallest pencilfish. Other common names include miniature pencilfish, miniature nannostomus, and Anduzi's nannostomus. Distribution Nannostomus anduzei is restricted to the Amazonian region of the South American continent and has only been formally reported from two localities in the north of that area. The first, and site of discovery, was 20 km north of the small Venezuelan town of Puerto Ayacucho in a small lagoon, in the upper regions of the Rio Orinoco, at 5¬∞ 50' N, 67¬∞ 30' W. The second site was some 700 km to the southeast, in the Lago Caatinga, off the Rio Erer√™, a tributary of the Rio Negro at 0¬∞ 14' S; 63¬∞ 53' W. These limited data are reflected in the range map above, where it is not possible to say where else the species might be found. However, because these fish occasionally do appear in the aquarium trade (see also below), their true range likely is somewhat wider than indicated. While the two known sites are geographically widely separated in two river systems, the Orinoco and the Negro are linked by the Casiquiare canal, so migration between the two sites is possible. N. anduzei does not appear in a systematic list of fishes of Columbia, though the northern Orinoco locality is only a few kilometres from the Colombian border. This could represent undersampling in what is a remote part of the forest. Description This is a very small fish: even fully grown adults are only a maximum of about 16 mm and it can become sexually mature at only 11 mm. As such, it is the smallest member of its genus currently known, the next smallest being N. minimus, which is not sexually mature until about 14 mm in length. Though small in size, the species is strikingly colored. The fish is mainly golden brown with a metallic gold stripe running the length of the body along the lateral line. The most notable feature is a pair of brilliant, rich red patches on the anal and caudal fins. Some anatomical features discriminate N. anduzei from related fish, notably reduced fin ray counts on the pelvic and caudal fins and the possession of only four premaxillary teeth. These three features are perhaps related to the reduced size. N. anduzei is sexually dimorphic in that consistent differences are seen between males and females. Males show brighter coloration around the red patches on the tail and anal fins, especially when in breeding condition. Males are also slimmer-bodied and have a longer anal fin (3 mm in males; 2 mm in females), with some of the surrounding muscle modified to enable mating, a common feature shared with other members of the genus. Females can have a brighter longitudinal body stripe; the red patches are almost always somewhat paler. Discovery and identification Nannostomus anduzei was the 15th member to be discovered, according to the currently accepted taxonomical classification of the genus. It was first described by Fernandez and Weitzman in 1987 in a collection of about 30 specimens collected from the Orinoco site detailed above. The specimens were originally collected on December 1, 1984. The specific name was proposed by the discoverers in honour of Dr Pablo Anduzi, a supporter of their research studies on fish in Amazonia. Taxonomy Nannostomus anduzei is one of 18 species currently recognized in the genus Nannostomus, which itself is one of seven genera in the Lebiasinidae, a family of freshwater fish in the Characiformes. Phylogenetic relationships Nannostomus anduzei possesses certain anatomical characteristics which indicate it is definitely a member of the Nannostomus genus‚Äîthese are discussed by Fernandez and Weitzman. However, what is less well understood is its relationship to other species within the genus: i.e. it is not certain to which other species it is most closely related. Diet Typically of the Lebiasinidae, N. anduzei is an omnivore, and with its small overall size and mouth takes small food items. In the wild, these likely include small invertebrates from the water column, as in an aquarium setting, where crushed flake food and dried or frozen natural food are taken. It is also reported to indulge in surface browsing of algae or biofilm and this may represent a significant portion of the diet. Physiological differences from other Nannostomus members A well known characteristic of most members of the genus Nannostomus is the body color pattern change which occurs in these fish between night and day. Newly lit specimens can look dramatically different from those that have been under lighting for a few minutes. Typically, the longitudinal stripes are replaced by patches that run dorsoventrally. The physiological basis of these changes is understood in that they are known to be controlled by the melatonin system acting upon different types of melatonin receptors in melanphores located in the fish's skin. See also Nannostomus trifasciatus for additional information. However, N. anduzei does not show this characteristic; instead, at night, it is reported simply to become much paler in color, with very little evidence of horizontal stripes, and the red on the fins fading almost to nothing. In the aquarium Nannostomus anduzei is only rarely deliberately exported from the wild for the aquarium trade. Occasional specimens turn up as bycatch with other species, but dedicated shipments of substantial numbers of this species are relatively unusual. As a consequence of this N. anduzei is not commonly reported on and its aquarium needs and suitability are not well characterized. It has been bred in captivity. Given its diminutive size, a group of individuals would probably thrive in a modest-sized aquarium. In addition, its native water conditions are acidic, warm (26-28 ¬∞C) and low in water hardness, indicating it would prefer these conditions in the aquarium. Its small size would be expected to make it especially suitable for the increasingly popular \\"nano aquaria\\".

The same year he had obtained a doctorate for two theses presented to the Sorbonne: L'intellectualisme de saint Thomas and Pour l'histoire du probleme de l'amour au Moyen Age. In November 1909 he entered the Institut Catholique at Paris; he was given the chair of dogmatic theology in the following year, which he occupied till he was called to military service in 1914, apart from a year (1912‚Äì13) spent in England. He was killed in battle at √âparges, on 25 April 1915, aged 37.Lebreton 14:col. 134. Works Rousselot's L‚Äôintellectualisme de saint Thomas drew attention to the continuing vitality in Thomas‚Äô synthesis of Christian Platonism.Aidan Nichols, From Newman to Congar: The Idea of Doctrinal Development from the Victorians to the Second Vatican Council (Edinburgh: T&T; Clark, 1990) 197. Rousselot suggested a new concept of revelation: that revelation be conceived not as a sum total of distinct truths, propositions, judgements, but as a kind of knowledge that is indefinitely cashable (monnayable) in distinct ideas and propositions which explicitate it without being able to exhaust it, and without claiming to supplement it. Revelation, he proposed, was the living and loving knowledge that the apostles had of Jesus. The mode in which the many dogmas are precontained in the single changeless knowledge which is the apostolic deposit is not logical, but Christological.Nichols 202. De Lubac's contribution to the question of doctrinal development is largely a restatement of that of Rousselot, whose papers he studied and published.

However, the brigade was reformed, as the 53rd Infantry Brigade, on 18 September 1939, after the outbreak of the Second World War, in the Territorial Army from the redesignation of the 163rd Infantry Brigade, originally part of the 54th (East Anglian) Infantry Division. The brigade was assigned to the 18th Infantry Division, a duplicate of 54th Division. During the early years of the war the brigade remained with the 18th Division in the United Kingdom, mainly on training duties and on home defence and anticipating a German invasion. However, the invasion never arrived. In late 1941, the brigade was sent, with the rest of 18th Division, overseas, initially to the Middle East but later to Singapore after Japan entered the war in December. The brigade landed first and fought in the short but bitter and violent Battle of Singapore where they were forced to surrender to the Imperial Japanese Army and became prisoners for the next three years, and received extremely harsh and degrading treatment.At the time of its capture the 53rd Brigade was commanded by Brigadier C.L.B.

Location Yakoma lies on the south bank of the Uele River at the point where that river enters the Ubangi River. The Ubangi defines the border between the DRC and the Central African Republic. Although it rains at all times of the year, the rainy season is from late March to early November, with the period from May to August being wettest. Dews are frequent at all times of the year. Colonial period The government of the Congo Free State established a post at Yakoma for collection of ivory and rubber. It lay opposite the original French capital of Ubangi-Shari (the present-day Central African Republic) at les Abiras. In 1894 and 1895, the initial settlers of the area extracted the resources by force. A traveler who visited the post at Yakoma in 1905 noted the workers were paid, but primary in the form of beads and salt rather than currency. Sleeping sickness seems to have been introduced to the area through the rise in canoe traffic to provision the colonial posts along the river from Libenge to Yakoma. A lazaret was established in 1909 in an attempt to deal with the problem, despite lack of support from the territorial administration. More than 200 victims were buried at Yakoma between November 1910 and August 1911. By November 1912 as many as 70% of the people in some villages had been infected. Yakoma today As of 2012 the population was estimated as 12,210. There is a hospital in the town with 91 beds and an occupancy rate of 70% - 90%.

The film is based on the 2006 book Pink Ribbons, Inc: Breast Cancer and the Politics of Philanthropy by Samantha King, associate professor of kinesiology and health studies at Queen's University. The film documents how some companies use pink ribbon-related marketing to increase sales while contributing only a small fraction of proceeds to the cause, or use \\"pinkwashing\\" to improve their public image while manufacturing products that may be carcinogenic. For the millions that are raised for breast cancer research by the campaign, the film argues that not enough money goes to prevention or exploring possible environmental factors. Pink Ribbons, Inc. features interviews with critics of the pink ribbon campaign, researchers and cancer patients as well as cancer fundraisers such as Nancy Brinker, head of Susan G.

Pool interviews Charlotte Haley, who began a peach-coloured ribbon campaign more than 20 years ago to press the National Cancer Institute to increase its budget for cancer prevention research, from a mere 5 per cent. When Haley was approached by Self magazine and cosmetics company Est√©e Lauder in 1992 to use her ribbons in a breast cancer awareness campaign she refused, because she had no desire to be part of a commercial effort. So the company changed the colour to pink, to circumvent Haley's efforts. Also featured is the \\"IV League,\\" a support group in Austin, Texas for women diagnosed with Stage 4 breast cancer, who feel unwelcome in the pink ribbon movement because, in the words of one member, \\"They‚Äôre learning to live and you‚Äôre learning to die.\\" Author Samantha King has called it ‚Äúthe tyranny of cheerfulness.‚Äù Development Ravida Din, an NFB producer, is a breast cancer survivor who had read Samantha King's book as well as Barbara Ehrenreich's 2001 Harper's Magazine article \\"Welcome to Cancerland\\" after her own experience with the disease and its treatment: After developing an outline for the project with help from scriptwriters Nancy Guerin and Patricia Kearns, Din began looking for the right director, and approached Pool with the project. Style Pool illustrates written facts about breast cancer, in place of traditional documentary narration, and includes animation by Francis Gelinas as well as an archival TV clip of Alfred Hitchcock directing William Shatner as a doctor telling a patient she has breast cancer. The film heavily features the colour pink, on clothing, in marketing, and floodlit monuments like Niagara Falls and the Empire State Building. This movie also shows several clips of public rallies and walking/running events, such as the Komen Walk for the Cure. Reception =Release= Pink Ribbons, Inc. premiered at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival. It opened in Canadian theatres on February 3, 2012, a date which coincided with the reversal of a controversial Susan G. Komen attempt to sever ties to Planned Parenthood's US breast screening clinic programmes. According to Deborah Drisdell, head of the NFB's accessibility and digital enterprises division, the NFB chose to distribute the film itself in Canada rather than use a commercial distributor to better control the marketing and capitalize on its ongoing work with community groups in Canada. First Run Features will distribute Pink Ribbons, Inc. in the United States. =Critical reviews= Currently, Pink Ribbons, Inc. has a rating of 88% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 33 reviews and an average score of 7/10.

It was built for Solomon Comstock and his family from 1882 to 1883 in a mix of Queen Anne and Eastlake style. Comstock (1842‚Äì1933) was one of Moorhead's first settlers and an influential figure in business, politics, civics, and education in the growing city and state. The Comstock House is run by a partnership between the Minnesota Historical Society and the Historical and Cultural Society of Clay County. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974 as the Solomon Gilman Comstock House for its state- level significance in the themes of architecture, commerce, education, exploration/settlement, industry, politics/government, and transportation. It was nominated for its association with Solomon Comstock, who was instrumental in growing Moorhead from a pioneer village to a \\"booming railroad town\\", and for its exemplary late Victorian architecture. Background and early history Solomon Comstock came to Moorhead with the Northern Pacific Railway in 1871 as a track layer after his law career in Omaha, Nebraska, and Saint Paul, Minnesota, stalled. Within ten years of arriving he became the first Clay County Attorney, a Minnesota senator, owner of the Northwest Land Company, and a business associate of James J. Hill. After two large floods in 1880 and 1881, Comstock decided to move out of the area by the Red River where the family first lived, the Points neighborhood. He planned to build a large house that would shelter his growing family at a safe distance from the flood waters as well as Moorhead's rough saloon district. A plot in the Highlands addition of Moorhead fit all of these criteria. Comstock chose a Minneapolis architecture firm, Kees & Fisk, to design the home. They used a combination of Queen Anne and Eastlake styles in the eleven-room structure. The property's outbuildings included a carriage house and an ice house; the latter was demolished in the late 1950s. To support Fargo‚ÄìMoorhead business, Comstock hired local contractors to complete the project. Comstock was hands-on with the construction of the home, picking out the different types of wood that were used throughout the structure. He spared no expense. A clause in the contract with the builders required them to use the \\"best available materials\\" or risk replacement at the cost of the contractor. The Comstocks were prominent Moorhead citizens, and their house hosted many people and community organizations from around Moorhead. Sarah Comstock, Solomon's wife, was the first president of the Moorhead Public Library Board. Before the completion of the library building in 1906, board members conducted meetings around the Comstock family's dining room table. The Moorhead Women's Club, of which Sarah was a founding member, also met at the Comstock House. Later history The Comstock House stayed in family hands until 1965, when George Comstock and his wife Frances Frazier Comstock donated it to the Minnesota Historical Society (MNHS). In 1974 the house was added to the National Register of Historic Places. The Comstock House Historical Society was formed to help restore the home to its 1883 appearance. After six years of fundraising, the house opened for public tours in 1980. The largest renovation project at the Comstock House began in 1988, when MNHS employee Kendra Dillard created a furnishing plan. To carry it out, staff hired restorers to replace wallpaper, install new carpeting, and reupholster two chairs. Extensive research into the originals guided the effort; Dillard identified the chairs' original upholstery and worked with a company in Boston to create and emboss an exact duplicate of the fabric. In 2004 the City of Moorhead signed a contract with the Minnesota Historical Society to manage the day-to-day operations of the Comstock House. It did so until 2015, when the house was closed to the public for a year during a lead paint remediation project. After the house reopened in 2016, the Historical and Cultural Society of Clay County took over management.

On 1 October 1944, a total of 602 men ‚Äì almost the entire male population of the village ‚Äì were taken from Putten, in the central Netherlands, and deported to various concentration camps inside Germany. Only 48 returned at the end of the war. The raid was carried out as a reprisal for a Dutch resistance attack on a vehicle carrying personnel from the Wehrmacht. Background On the night of 30 September-1 October 1944, a car carrying two officers and two corporals of the German Army was ambushed by members of the Dutch resistance near the Oldenallerbrug bridge between Putten and Nijkerk. In the attack, a resistance fighter named Frans Slotboom was wounded; he later died. One German officer, Lieutnant Otto Sommer, was also injured, and escaped to a nearby farmhouse to raise the alarm; he died the following day. The two German corporals fled while the second officer, Oberleutnant Eggart, was injured and captured. Due to his wounds, the resistance fighters abandoned him in a place where he could be found by the Germans. German reprisal 660 symbolic graves in the Putten memorial garden The German reprisal raid was conducted the following day. At the command of Captain-at-Sea Friedrich Christiansen, Putten was surrounded by German forces. The women and men of the village were captured and separated, and over 100 houses in the village were set on fire. Six men and a woman were shot dead during the raid. The women were held at the church until 9 pm, while the men and boys were detained separately nearby at the village school. On 2 October, 661 men between the ages of 18 and 50 were taken to Amersfoort concentration camp, where 59 and older or unfit men were released. The remaining 602 men left Amersfoort on 11 October and taken to Neuengamme concentration camp as forced labour. During the transportation, 13 men escaped by jumping off the train. From Neuengamme, some were moved to other camps or sub-camps, including Ladelund, Bergen-Belsen, Meppen-Versen, Beendorf, W√∂bbelin and Malchow. Only 48 men returned after the end of the war, but another 5 died, due to their mistreatment in the camps, after they arrived home. Some people returned crippled, as they had been kept in small cages they could not stand in. As further reprisals, the SS set fire to 105 houses. A total of 552 men and 1 woman died, mostly victims of malnutrition, slave labour, and infectious diseases. Memorials Lady of Putten memorial Commemorative stone at the Oude Kerk in Putten A monument commemorating the victims of the raid was unveiled by Queen Juliana on 1 October 1949. The monument includes a memorial park designed by Jan Bijhouwer, and a sandstone statue called \\"treurende weduwe\\" (mourning widow) by Mari Andriessen depicting a grieving woman in traditional dress with a handkerchief in her hand, better known as \\"het Vrouwtje van Putten (The little Lady of Putten)\\". The statue looks toward the Oude Kerk (Old Church) in Putten, from where the men were deported. A silent memorial is held at the monument on 2 October each year, attended by hundreds of people. Wreaths are laid by the College van Burgemeester & Wethouders (Dutch: The College of the Mayor and Municipal Executive), the \\"Stichting Oktober '44\\" (Dutch: The October '44 Foundation), a few surviving returnees (until the last one died in 2013), schoolchildren from Putten and other organizations from the Netherlands and abroad. No speeches are made, but a music group plays appropriate music and a choir sings verses of Psalm 84, as the Putten men did when they were taken away.

He is best known for serving as a political decoy for General Montgomery, and for being imprisoned in Auschwitz. The beginning and military occupation Banwell was born in Newport, Essex. His father served with the Australian Imperial Force, and Banwell lived in Australia from 1920 until he returned to England in 1936 to join the Coldstream Guards. He later transferred to 1st Battalion, the Hampshire Regiment, and served in India, Palestine and then Egypt, where he was a temporary physical training instructor, and was given the nickname \\"Tex\\". After the outbreak of war, he volunteered for special service and joined No. 52 (Middle East) Commando, and then the Long Range Desert Group. He was captured in 1942 during a raid on Tobruk, but he and a friend stole a German vehicle and escaped back to British lines. He was captured a second time during a raid on Crete. Taken prisoner near Heraklion, he was guarded by Max Schmeling, a former world heavyweight boxing champion. Banwell escaped again with some friends on a stolen assault landing craft, but they ran out of fuel and drifted for nine days before reaching the coast of North Africa. Banwell's resemblance to General Montgomery was noticed while he was hospitalised for three months to recover. Banwell was dressed up in a similar uniform to Montgomery, and driven around North Africa as Montgomery's double to confuse German spies. He was taller than Montgomery, so was instructed to remain seated in a vehicle while out in public. Bored with this role, Banwell joined the 10th Battalion, Parachute Regiment. He became an accomplished cross- country runner and boxer, and was also practised in judo. He was a platoon sergeant when he took part in Operation Market Garden in September 1944. He was wounded and captured, but escaped during the journey to a prisoner of war camp with Lieutenant Leo Heaps of the 1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment, and Staff-Sergeant Alan Kettley of the Glider Pilot Regiment. The three escapees made contact with the Dutch resistance. Banwell agreed to become a weapons instructor, demonstrating how the Dutch should use their new British weapons, while the other two escaped. He took the codename \\"Tex\\", and was involved in several resistance ambushes of the occupying Germans - including an action near the town of Putten on 1 October 1944, after which 600 local men were arrested and deported to Neuengamme concentration camp. Eventually, Banwell was captured by the Germans again; he was flown to Berlin and interrogated by the Gestapo about his connections with the Dutch resistance. He refused to betray his friends and faced two dummy firing squads before he was sent to Auschwitz concentration camp. He survived four months of a starvation diet, confined in a square cage. He was then moved to Fallingbostel, where he was liberated by the Red Army in March 1945, having lost half his body weight. Post-war Banwell rejoined the 10th Battalion, Parachute Regiment when it was reformed as a Territorial Army unit in 1947, and continued to serve in the British Army until the 1970s, retiring as a sergeant. He then joined the Post Office, and also served as a special constable. He continued parachuting as a hobby, and made his 1,000th jump at Arnhem in September 1984 (the 40th anniversary of the battle), and his 1,001st and final jump in Arnhem in 1994 for the 50th anniversary. His wartime experiences were included in the book The Grey Goose of Arnhem, published in 1977 by Leo Heaps, the Canadian who also served at Arnhem with the 1st Battalion of the Parachute Regiment (and son of Canadian politician Abraham Albert Heaps). He was awarded the British Empire Medal in the 1969 New Year Honours and the Dutch Resistance Memorial Cross in 1982 (one of very few members of the British Armed Forces to receive this award). Personal life and death Banwell died in London. He married his first wife, Winifred, on 4 March 1944; they had a son and two daughters. His survivors included the three children of his first marriage, and his second wife, Elsie. His ashes were buried in the Airborne Cemetery in Oosterbeek in September 1999, and his battledress jacket and medals are on display at the Airborne Museum at the former Hotel Hartenstein also in Oosterbeek.

Laikipia AB was established in 1974 as Nanyuki Air Base and later renamed for the county in which it is located. History On 25 February 1974, Nanyuki Air Base was opened by the Kenya Air Force (KAF) as its primary airfield for fighter aircraft. In June 1974, the KAF's fleet of BAC Strikemaster aircraft were transferred from RAF Eastleigh (later named KAF Eastleigh) to Nanyuki Air Base. Also in 1974, the KAF purchased six Hawker Hunter combat jets from the Royal Air Force and located them at Nanyuki Air Base (which had since its opening been renamed KAF Nanyuki). In 1978, the Northrop F-5 Freedom Fighter was introduced to the KAF and also based at Nanyuki, and the following year, Nanyuki became the home of the KAF's fleet of Hawker Siddeley Hawk flight training jets. After the a failed coup by a group of KAF officers on 1 August 1982, the Kenya Air Force was disbanded and placed under the control of the Kenyan Army. During this period, KAF Eastleigh was renamed Moi Air Base and KAF Nanyuki was renamed Laikipia Air Base. In August 2014, gunmen drove into one of the airfield's gate and opened fire. One soldier was injured. =British presence= In 2015, the UK began an infrastructure project to relocate the HQ for its British Army training unit in Kenya, named the British Army Training Unit Kenya (BATUK), to Laikipia Air Base. The HQ is located within an area designated Laikipia Air Base East (LAB(E)). Previously, it was located on land leased from the Nanyuki Agricultural Society, which had to be vacated every year to make way for an agricultural show. LAB(E) now provides permanent facilities on land leased directly from the Kenyan government. BATUK is used to train around 10,000 British troops per year and has 300 permanent personnel.

Founded by the Eudist Fathers in 1946 as a school for boys to receive a classical education, it received its provincial charter the following year. Originally, the school was run out of former military barracks. In 1949 the current campus was built, and named the Simon-Larouche pavilion after its first rector. The Religious Hospitallers of Saint Joseph, an international order of nuns who ran the nearby hospital, also ran a college for females called Coll√®ge Maillet in nearby Saint-Basile. In 1953, the two institutions were granted the right to issue university degrees. Coll√®ge Saint-Louis then became Universit√© Saint-Louis and granted degrees in the classical humanities, while Coll√®ge Maillet began granted bachelor's degrees in nursing. With the foundation of Universit√© de Moncton in 1963, the Universit√© de Saint-Louis agreed to revoke its university status and once again became a college. In 1973 it merged with the Coll√®ge Maillet, and adopted the new name Coll√®ge Saint-Louis-Maillet. In 1977 the new college became a campus of Moncton University. In 1985 a school of forestry sciences was founded (now called the faculty of forestry), and in 1994 it officially changed its name to Universit√© de Moncton- Campus d'Edmundston.

He was the son of Clement Warner, and the grandfather of Fred A. Risser. Warner Park in Madison is named after him.  Background  Warner was born on his parents' farm in the town of Windsor in Dane County, Wisconsin on July 23, 1868, son of Col. Clement Edson and Eliza (Noble) Warner. (Clement Warner was at that time a state senator, and later served a term in the Assembly.) Ernest attended the district public school, and graduated from the old Madison High School in 1885, and the University of Wisconsin-Madison's modern classics course in 1889. He taught a country school for one term while attending the University, and was principal of Mazomanie High School for one year after graduation. He graduated from the Law Department of the University in 1892, although he was admitted to practice upon passing the state bar examinations in July, 1891; and took up law practice in Madison. On July 5, 1894 he married Lillian Dale Baker, a classmate at Madison High School and also at the University of Wisconsin. They maintained a family farm, Merrill Springs Farm, at a location which was then outside Madison.  Politics and public office  Warner was the Republican nominee for district attorney of Dane County in 1892 but lost; was a law examiner in the Attorney General's department from 1899‚Äì1903; and was secretary of the Dane County Republican campaign committee 1902-1904. In 1904 Warner was elected to the Assembly's 1st Dane County district (the Towns of Blooming Grove, Dunn, Madison and Pleasant Springs, and the city of Madison) to succeed fellow Republican Matthew Dudgeon, receiving 3,761 votes to 2,926 for Democrat Joseph C.

History Crest as Wolstanton High School The school was founded in 1928, as Wolstanton County Grammar School, as a replacement for The Orme Middle School, which closed in 1927. The grammar school was originally designed for 500 male students from a catchment area that included Staffordshire and the neighbouring parts of Cheshire. In 1978 the school merged with Watlands Secondary Modern School to become the Marshlands High School, and later became Wolstanton High School in the 1980s. Starting with the academic year of 2020, the school renamed itself to The Orme Academy. In a 2012, Ofsted judged the school as \\"satisfactory,\\" but that fell to \\"requires improvement\\" by 2013. It was noted that the majority of students are of \\"White British backgrounds, with a small number from other ethnic groups.\\" The number of students \\"eligible for free school meals is just below the national average.\\" Academics In 2018 Ofsted recognised this as an improving school with good leadership, raising the standards, but facing students with low aspirations ‚Äì that still required improvement. At Key Stage 3, that is in years 7, 8, 9, the staff try to engage the parents in supporting their children. Year 7 children study English, Mathematics, Science, Technology, a Foreign Language, Geography, History, Art, Music, Literacy, Physical Education, Religious Education, Computing and Personal, Social, Health and Citizenship. Extra support in English and Maths is targeted at some students. In year 8, some students are given the chance to study triple science. At Key Stage 4, the pupils were guided into three pathways: Blue Green and Purple. These allow student to focus on a BTEC education, a GCSE academic route or more practical subjects. Each pathway follows a core curriculum of English Language, English Literature, Mathematics, Science, Computing, Religious Education, Careers, Physical Education, and Personal, Social, Health and Citizenship Education (PSHCE). These will be supplemented by options suitable for their pathway.

Lord Chief Justice of Ireland during the years 1673‚Äì9. Background He was born at Woodseaves, near Market Drayton, Shropshire, eldest son of John Povey. Thomas Povey, the friend of Samuel Pepys and John Evelyn, who features often in Pepys' Diary, was his cousin.Carlyle, Edward Irving \\"Thomas Povey\\" Dictionary of National Biography Vol.46 pp.236-7 He was educated at Trinity College, Oxford, and matriculated in 1636. He entered Gray's Inn in 1638 and was called to the Bar in 1645.Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 John Murray London 1926 Vol. 1 p.350 Market Drayton, Shropshire, Povey's birthplace, modern day Career He is first heard of in Ireland in 1658, when he was acting as legal advisor to Sir John Barrington, 3rd Baronet, a politician and landowner who, although he was a relative of Oliver Cromwell, had refused to sit as one of the judges at the trial of Charles I. Povey went on the Munster circuit, did well at the Irish Bar, and brought his family to live in Ireland.Ball, p.350 He lived at Nicholas St. in Dublin, and later bought Powerstown House, Mulhuddart, outside Dublin city. After the Restoration of Charles II, Povey continued to prosper: James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland thought well of him, while his cousin Thomas was now Treasurer to the future Catholic King James II. He sat in the Irish House of Commons as member for Swords and was a Commissioner of Revenue Appeals. He was appointed third Baron of the Exchequer in 1663. One of his more notable judgments was to allow the indictment of several persons for aiding and abetting murder during the Irish Rebellion of 1641.Ball, p.350 In 1673 the office of Lord Chief Justice fell vacant. The most highly qualified candidates, although both had serious health problems, were Povey and Sir Robert Booth. Arthur Capell, 1st Earl of Essex, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, supported Booth, but Charles II, who favoured the greatest possible degree of toleration of Roman Catholics, rejected him as being too strong a Protestant. Povey, with his connection to the future James II's household, was an acceptable compromise.Ball, p.287 He was knighted, and given the Freedom of the City of Dublin. He earned praise for his service as Chief Justice, and it was suggested that he be might be transferred to the English Bench in 1675; but soon after his wife's death in 1677 his health began to fail. He went to France in hope of a cure, but died at Bordeaux early in 1679. His body was brought back to Ireland, and he was buried in St. Michan's Church, DublinBall, p.351 Family In 1648 he married Elizabeth Folliott, eldest daughter of Guthlake (or Guthlac) Folliott of Martin Hussingtree, Worcester, and his wife Elizabeth, and sister of Isabella Folliott Tomkins, to whom her father-in-law, the Welsh composer Thomas Tomkins, dedicated his work Gaillard- the Lady Folliott's. They had four children: *John Povey (c.1649‚Äì1715) M.P. *Charles, who has been tentatively identified as the writer and entrepreneur Charles Povey (c.1651‚Äì1743) *Richard *Mary, who married Dr. William Smyth (1638-1699), Bishop of Raphoe, and later Bishop of Kilmore.

In 2003, he was awarded the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists for his reporting on the Second Chechen War. Background Muradov was born around 1958 in Grozny. He studied journalism at Moscow State University, graduating in 1982. He then joined the staff of Groznensky Rabochy, a weekly newspaper in Grozny that had been established in 1917. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Muradov became the paper's editor-in-chief. Initially, the newspaper, formerly controlled by the Communist Party, was independent. However, in 1993 Dzhokar Dudayev, president of Chechnya's new, unrecognized secessionist government, attempted to convert the paper into an official publication of his party. In reaction, Muradov and most of his staff quit, leading the newspaper to shut down. Muradov found work for a time teaching journalism at a local university, as well as reporting for a small regional publication. In 1994, amid the growing violence of the First Chechen War, he and his family left Grozny for the relative safety of Moscow. Return of Groznensky Rabochy Muradov and his family returned to Grozny in 1995, and Groznensky Rabochy resumed publishing as an independent newspaper in May, again with Muradov as its editor-in-chief. The work was dangerous, as the staff was reporting and publishing in the combat zone of Grozny. On 1 August 1996, Ivan Gogun, one of the paper's reporters, was killed in a crossfire in the Third Battle of Grozny. Muradov himself was trapped in a basement by damage from an artillery shell, remaining there for fourteen days. The paper continued reporting through the Second Chechen War. Long-time Groznensky Rabochy correspondent Supian Ependiyev was killed covering the aftermath of a rocket attack on a Grozny bazaar on 27 October 1999; while he was conducting his interviews, a second round of rockets struck the bazaar, leaving him with fatal shrapnel injuries. At around this time, the paper was struggling financially, and its building was destroyed in Russian bombing. The staff relocated to Nazran in nearby Ingushetia, a federal subject of Russia that borders Chechnya. They nonetheless continued reporting on the conflict, shipping the paper back to Grozny on a weekly basis. They also took turns serving week-long shifts reporting from Grozny. According to Muradov, the Russian military had placed a number of restrictions on foreign journalists, limiting their access strictly to military bases and escorted tours, but as local Chechens, Muradov and his staff could evade these requirements and speak directly to Grozny's civilians. By 2001, however, both sides of the conflict had grown angry with Groznensky Rabochy's attempted neutrality, perceiving it as an implied endorsement of the opposing side. The Nazran offices of Groznensky Rabochy were searched by Russia's Federal Security Service and Ministry of Internal Affairs, while Wahhabi Chechen extremists declared a sentence of death for the paper's staff under Sharia law and began a series of threatening phone calls to the office. Muradov again moved with his family to Moscow to avoid the threats, and the remainder of the Groznensky Rabochy staff spread out across Russia. Muradov later stated that the strain of his reporting took a great toll on his family, nearly causing his wife and children to leave him. Post-war reporting After the war, Groznensky Rabochy soon went bankrupt. Muradov became a full- time correspondent for Kommersant, a Russian business daily, while continuing to contribute to the German paper Die Welt. In 2004, he made international news when he succeeded in voting four times in the 2004 presidential election for a story on election irregularities. He wrote that he was confident that he could have voted more times had he not had to file his story. In 2009, Dukvakha Abdurakhmanov, Speaker of the Chechen Parliament and ally of Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov, denounced Muradov as \\"a scoundrel and a traitor to the Chechen people\\" who \\"has committed a crime against Chechen history\\", after Muradov published an interview with head of the Chechen Republic Ichkeria government-in-exile Akhmed Zakayev. In the interview, Zakayev had alleged that despite a year of Kadyrov saying publicly that he had invited Zakayev to return to Chechnya, Kadyrov had not extended the invitation in either of their conversations. International recognition In 2003, Muradov was awarded the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists, \\"an annual recognition of courageous journalism\\". The award citation praised Groznensky Rabochy as a \\"rare voice of reason\\" in the violence and distorted coverage of Chechnya, as well as Muradov's \\"refusal\\" to \\"become a mouthpiece for either side\\".

Brooks was an Indiana high school basketball star who was named both 1984 Co-Indiana Mr. Basketball and 1984 USA Today Player of the Year. After high school, he first attended Indiana University to play basketball for Bobby Knight. When he didn't fit into the team plans as he had hoped he transferred to play for Rick Pitino at Providence College, where the team was one of the most successful in school history. As a professional player, his career floundered in various leagues before he began coaching basketball as an assistant for Pitino at the University of Kentucky. He reached the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship final four as both a player and assistant coach. When Pitino left for the NBA, he moved on to a head coaching position at the University of Texas-Pan American. He was eventually caught up in a scandal and fired. He has since coached various high school teams. , he is the head coach for the men's basketball team at Clay High School. Early life In high school, he served as junior and senior class president as well as governor of the Indiana Boys State Convention. He was 1984 co-Indiana Mr. Basketball and USA Today Boys' Basketball Player of the Year while playing for the Rogers High School, who went 28-1. He is also retroactively regarded as a runner-up for Mr. Basketball USA. He was one of two high school players (along with Danny Manning) invited to try out for the United States men's national basketball team at the 1984 Summer Olympics. Brooks also earned varsity letters in baseball and tennis. College =Indiana= He subsequently played for the 1984‚Äì85 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team and part of the season for the 1985‚Äì86 Hoosiers before transferring to Providence. He played more than any other Indiana freshmen, averaging 15 minutes per game and starting seven times by mid February. Among his early season highlights were a 10-assist December 8, 1984 game against Kentucky and a 15-point effort against . Later in the season, he tallied 16 points against . By the end of the season, he had started 12 games, but his playing time was reduced and he only averaged 2.4 points per game to start his sophomore season. He had been expected to be the sixth man behind Steve Alford and Stew Robinson. He was frustrated with his lack of playing time and after only playing 4 minutes in the first two conference games against Michigan and Michigan State as a sophomore he decided to transfer. =Providence= Notre Dame had been Brooks' second choice behind Indiana, but Notre Dame had a policy against transfer athletes. He was ineligible for scholarships from other Big Ten Conference schools. He had an offer to transfer from NC State, but chose Providence. He enrolled in the spring of 1986, making him ineligible to play until the end of the Fall 1986 semester. Under head coach Rick Pitino, he restructured his jump shot. He completed his ineligibility on December 20, 1986. Within a little over a week, Brooks and Billy Donovan combined for 50 or more points on two separate occasions. On January 10, he went 8-for-9 on three-point field goal and set a new career-high with 34 points, helping Providence end a 12-game losing streak against the Villanova Wildcats. As of February 13, Providence led the nation in three-point shots with 8.5 per game in the first year of its use. Sixth-seeded Providence made their second ever Final Four at the 1987 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament with Donovan and Brooks for Pitino. In the Sweet Sixteen round, Brooks scored a game-high 26 points against Southeastern Conference champion, second-seeded Alabama. The 1986‚Äì87 Hoosiers made the final four along with the 1986‚Äì87 Friars. The Final Four loss to Syracuse was marred by a bench-clearing brawl that began when Brooks and Sherman Douglas got tangled up. Brooks led the 1987-88 Friars in scoring but went undrafted in the 1988 NBA Draft. Professional career He played for the Erie Wave of the World Basketball League (WBL) before founding the Florida Jades of the WBL in 1991. For a time he was working for the management of a drug store chain while playing in the WBL. He eventually became a player/founder/manager of the Florida Jades when he served as the team's Vice President of Basketball Operations. Coaching career He later served on Pitino's staff at Kentucky, from 1992-97 including the National Champion 1995‚Äì96 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team. He spent his first year as the recruiting coordinator and assistant strength and conditioning coach before being promoted to assistant coach. The 1992‚Äì93 Wildcats made the final four and the defending champion 1996‚Äì97 Wildcats lost in the championship game. Ten players that he recruited became National Basketball Association players. He then became the head coach for Texas‚ÄìPan American Broncs men's basketball for two seasons from 1997-99 before an embezzlement scandal erupted. Texas‚ÄìPan American had lost its National Collegiate Athletic Association certification in 1996, but the certification was restored in 1998. On August 23, 1999 Brooks was fired. On October 14, 1999, Brooks was indicted by a grand jury on a felony theft charge for an allegation regarding depositing a $25,000 check from Southwest Missouri State into his personal account and subsequently making withdrawals from the account. Brooks has denied making the deposit or instructing a third party to do so, although he consents that the alleged $25,000 was added to his account. In that jurisdiction, theft by a public servant of between $20,000 and $100,000 was a second-degree felony. An overcrowded Hidalgo County docket caused a trial delay, but in May 2000, he pleaded no contest in a plea bargain in which prosecutors recommended a maximum punishment of 10 years of probation conditional on repayment of stolen funds. Brooks was arrested in 2006 for failing to pay restitution and maintain communication with his probation officer. He coached in Florida and California before returning to his hometown to coach for five years at the La Lumiere School, where he also served as athletic director for the final two years. Among his players at La Lumiere was eventual Northwestern player, Luka Mirkovic. La Lumiere was a non-Indiana High School Athletic Association (IHSAA) member. In 2015, he became the head coach of the men's basketball team at Clay High School where he has served as a special education teacher since 2013. =Head coaching record= Personal His father, Raymond Brooks, was the fire chief of Michigan City, Indiana and became the fire chief of Evanston, Illinois approximately at the beginning of 1988.

The Continuum Companion to Twentieth Century Theatre, London: Continuum, 2002, p.410 was an English stage director and pioneer of \\"theatre in the round.\\" Life Stephen Joseph was born in London, the child of actress Hermione Gingold and the publisher Michael Joseph. He was educated at Clayesmore School in Dorset. At the age of 16 he became a student of the Central School of Speech and Drama, where he graduated two years later. From 1941 to 1946 he served as an officer in the Royal Navy, where he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. After the war he studied English literature at Jesus College, Cambridge, leading to the award of an MA degree. While at Cambridge he joined Footlights and both wrote and directed La Vie Cambridgienne, a revue broadcast by the BBC in July 1948. In November 1948 he joined the Lowestoft Repertory Theatre as director, then moved on to manage the Summer Theatre season at Frinton-on-Sea. While there he saw a production by Jack Mitchley of the Christopher Fry play A Phoenix too Frequent, staged in the round, which caused him to experience \\"a bee beginning to buzz at the back of my mind\\". He returned to the Central School of Speech and Drama as a tutor, then in 1951 was granted leave of absence to study for a degree in playwriting at the University of Iowa. Theatres in the round On his return he set up a company, Studio Theatre Ltd, devoted to productions in the round. After many difficulties and frustrations in finding suitable venues in London, a chance meeting led in 1955 to his using the concert room in the Central Library at Scarborough, on the Yorkshire coast. Initially the company did a summer season in Scarborough, and in winter toured other towns, partly with a view to finding a more permanent home for the company. This succeeded in 1962, when they found a disused cinema in Hartshill, Stoke-on-Trent, which became the Victoria Theatre, with Peter Cheeseman in charge. Meanwhile Joseph was appointed as fellow, and subsequently lecturer in the Department of Drama at the University of Manchester. He refounded the theatre in Scarborough as the Scarborough Theatre Trust, which by 1967 was beginning to be successful with the assistance of new playwrights such as Alan Ayckbourn. His work was brought to an untimely end, however, by his death in Scarborough from cancer in 1967. The Scarborough Theatre developed and became the Stephen Joseph Theatre. The Victoria Theatre in Stoke eventually relocated and became the New Vic Theatre. The Stephen Joseph Studio in Manchester is named in his honour. Alan Ayckbourn wrote > He knew more than any person I‚Äôve ever known about playwriting, when it came > to talking about it, and he knew more about directing than any living > person, and I suspect he knew an awful lot about acting: he certainly > managed to talk about it very lucidly and entertainingly and interestingly, > although he must have been the World‚Äôs worst actor. Stephen Joseph died aged 46, on Wednesday 4 October 1967, at his home in Scarborough. He had been working until the last. His legacy and name live on though in the theatres he created, the Stephen Joseph Theatre and the New Vic Theatre, and also through the playwrights he encouraged and inspired such as Alan Ayckbourn, Harold Pinter, James Saunders and Alan Plater. Books and professional societies In 1961 he helped to found the Association of British Theatre Technicians, and in 1964 the Society of Theatre Consultants. He wrote the following books:   See also *Stephen Joseph Studio Bibliography and sources * *Stephen Joseph at SJT *Stephen Joseph at Alan Ayckbourn *Stephen Joseph Papers at the John Rylands Library, Manchester.

From 1866 to 1870, he was in France where he studied in Paris under Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me and Adolphe Yvon at the √âcole des Beaux Arts, in the studio of Louis Jacquesson de la Chevreuse, and also in that of Sebastian Cornu. He received three medals in the government schools of Paris. After his studies in Europe, he was appointed in 1871 professor of drawing in the Yale School of Fine Arts, where he remained until 1908.

It is native to central Canada (Ontario) and the central and eastern United States (from Maine west to Wisconsin and south as far as Georgia and Louisiana) plus the Ozarks of Missouri, Arkansas, southeastern Kansas and eastern Oklahoma. Vaccinium pallidum is a deciduous shrub, erect in stature but variable in height. It generally grows tall, but depending on environmental conditions it ranges from 8 centimeters (3.2 inches) to one full meter (40 inches) in height. It is colonial, sprouting from its rhizome to form colonies of clones. The shrub has greenish brown to red bark on its stems, and the smaller twigs may be green, reddish, yellowish, or gray. The alternately arranged leaves are also variable. They are generally roughly oval and measure 2 to 6 centimeters (0.8‚Äì2.4 inches) long. They are green to yellowish or bluish in color, turning red in the fall. The flowers are cylindrical, bell-shaped, or urn-shaped and are borne in racemes of up to 11. They are white to pinkish or greenish in color, or \\"greenish white with pink striping\\", and about half a centimeter to one centimeter long. They are pollinated by bees such as bumblebees and Andrena carlini. The fruit is a berry up to 1.2 centimeters long. It is waxy blue to shiny black in color, or rarely pure white. It contains several seeds, a few of which are generally not viable. The plant reproduces sexually via seed and vegetatively by sprouting from the rhizome. Vaccinium pallidum grows in many types of habitat, including oak and chestnut woodlands, maple- dominated swamps, pine barrens, pine savanna, and a variety of forest types. It grows in the understory of trees such as red oak, black oak, white oak, post oak, chestnut oak, blackjack oak, Virginia pine, shortleaf pine, pitch pine, loblolly pine, longleaf pine, jack pine, eastern hemlock, red maple, and black cherry. Vaccinium pallidum is common on disturbed sites such as roadsides and abandoned fields. It also grows at climax in old-growth oak stands in the South Carolina piedmont. It can grow on dry, rocky soils, sandy and gravelly soils, and heavy clay. The climate is generally humid. The wild fruits are food for many types of bird and other animals. Each individual fruit has approximately eight calories. For humans the taste is \\"sweet to bland\\" and the fruit can be eaten fresh, in pies, or as jelly. The fruit is harvested and sold commercially in some areas, such as northeastern Alabama and northwestern Georgia. The plant is also grown as an ornamental.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1997 for its significance in architecture and social history. With The district is named for the six churches on the hill. It lies on a southeast-sloping hillside with the downtown to the south, the Society Hill historic district to the west, and later, middle and upper-class neighborhoods to the north and east. The homes in the Church Hill district were built as early as 1855. The most common styles are Queen Anne and Italianate, with notable structures listed below in the order built. Buildings * The duplex at 214-218 W. Howard is perhaps the oldest surviving structure in the district, built in 1855 as the Methodist Episcopal Church. In 1898 the congregation moved to a larger building at the corner of DeWitt and E. Pleasant and sold this building. In 1900 the new owner removed the steeple and converted the old church to a double residence, but it still retains the pediments, entablature, and corner pilasters which are hallmarks of Greek Revival style. * The German Evangelical Church at 233 W. Howard St. was built in 1871, a cream brick building in Romanesque Revival-style with a square tower on one side of the front and a steeple on the other side. Converted to a residence around 1973. * The Harvey Smith house at 603 DeWitt is a Second Empire-styled house completed in 1873. It is a 2.5-story home with a mansard roof, the hallmark of the style, and it is the only Second Empire house in the district. Smith was a cooper who owned house, but probably rented it out. Zona Gale's father Charles may have rented the house around 1886. * St. John's Evangelical Lutheran Church at 701 McFarlane Road is a Romanesque Revival- styled cream brick church built in 1874 with a tower centered at the front. * The William Fulton house at 134 W. Franklin is a cream brick 2-story house built in 1874. The house is styled Gothic Revival in the steep gables, the bay window, and the elaborate woodwork. Fulton was an immigrant from England, running a grocery business in Portage, advertising \\"Groceries, Seeds, Crockery, Glassware, etc.\\" He also ran a creamery. * The James Gowran house at 223 W. Pleasant is a two-story Italianate cream brick home built in 1877 with a low hip roof and wide bracketed eaves, and bay windows. The wraparound front porch was added between 1894 and 1897. Gowran sold farm implements with Hugh O. Lewis. Gowran's property includes a carriage house he built in 1877, clad in board and batten. * The Hugh O. Lewis house at 111 E. Pleasant is a two- story cream brick Italianate house built in 1879. Lewis was a blacksmith who ran a shop that built and sold farm implements. Over time, the porch and side wing were added to the house. E.W. Farrington House * The 1881 E.W. Farrington house at 220 W. Pleasant St. is a two-story cream brick home in Italianate style with a low hip roof with broad bracketed eaves, and a front porch with chamfered posts and a frieze. Farrington built the house and immediately sold it to O.D. Van Dusen, who owned lumber mills in Dorchester and a lumber yard in Portage, and later went into publishing. * The 1883 Robert Thomson house at 131 E. Howard is an Italianate cream brick house with corner quoins, a low- pitched hip roof, and broad eaves, but also with an emphasis on vertical which gives it a Gothic Revival flavor. Thomson was a cattle dealer. * The home at 208 W. Howard was built in 1884, a two-story cream brick Italianate-styled home with a low pyramidal roof. It was built for Miss Julliette W. Treadway, and later owned by D.G. Muir and William T. Muir. David Muir was a partner in a drugstore/mercantile which sold dry goods, clothing, boots, shoes, hats and caps. * The 1892 C.D. Maine house at 513 Dewitt is a two-story cream brick Queen Anne-styled house with multiple steep gables, ornately decorated with bargeboards, a two-story canted bay, and an oriel window. James Baird lived in the house from 1905 to the 1920s. Baird owned Portage Iron Works, which made agricultural equipment, ornamental cast iron, and later shifted to automobile repair. * The 1893 First Presbyterian Church at 120 W. Pleasant St. was designed in Richardsonian Romanesque style, with multiple rooflines, cream brick walls, wood shingling, Palladian windows, and buttresses. * The 1897 Otto Krisch house at 235 W. Pleasant St. is an elaborately detailed 2.5-story cream brick Queen Anne with closed, projecting gables, stickwork, colonettes, a two-story bay, and a wrap-around porch. Krisch was an immigrant from Austria who reached Portage in 1854 and started a grocery three years later. Krisch was musical, active in the Portage Leiderkranz and Turnverein. Krisch died before the house was finished. Jacob Leisch lived in the house from 1910; he was a partner in a tailor shop in Portage, which was one of the biggest in Wisconsin outside Milwaukee. * The 1898 St. John's Episcopal Church was designed by I. Jay Knapp of Milwaukee in Neogothic style with a side steeple and rose window. * The 1900 Hugh G. Lewis house at 105 E. Pleasant St. (at right in photo) is a 2.5-story cream brick Queen Anne designed by C.H. Williams of Pardeeville. It has many asymmetric gables, some with shingles and Palladian windows. It also has bay windows, metal roof cresting, and a pedimented front porch. Lewis ran a hardware store from 1895 to 1910, and after that dealt in farm equipment and hardware. * William S. Stroud bought the property at 207-209 W. Howard in 1892 and replaced or remodeled the house that was already there by 1901. The result is an early Dutch Colonial Revival style home with the hallmark gambrel roof and classic styling. Stroud had law offices in Wisconsin Dells and Portage, and served as district attorney and as a judge for Columbia County. * The 1904 Porter house at 101 E. Pleasant St. is a 2.5-story frame Queen Anne with a 2.5-story bay window, a wrap-around porch, stickwork, elaborate brackets, and recessed windows with small Ionic columns. Arthur Amasa Porter ran a grocery, served as Register of Deeds and postmaster, became a realtor and developer, and ran the _Wisconsin State Register_ until 1942. * The 1904 James R. Patterson house at 224 W. Pleasant St. is a 2.5-story frame Queen Anne designed by F.L. Lindsay with closed gables supported by brackets, bargeboards, leaded glass windows, and a front porch with fluted columns. Patterson worked at Portage Hosiery. * The 1907 S.M. Smith house at 110 E. Howard St. is a 2.5-story frame Queen Anne with vertical emphasis, shingles in the gables, and a pedimented front porch. Silas Smith had a law, abstract, real estate, load and insurance business. * The 1913 Wallace A. Murison house at 202 W. Howard St. is a 2.5-story American Foursquare-style house with the horizontal lines and colors of Prairie School, clad in tile and stucco. Murison was a partner in a family cabinet-making, undertaking, and furniture business. * The 1917 Andy Slinger house at 116 W. Howard St is a two-story frame American Foursquare house with broad eaves and a front porch. Slinger was part-owner of Portage Iron Works, which became Slinger Foundry, Machine, and Auto Co. * The 1925 Emily A. Zimmerman house at 123 E. Howard St. is a 1.5-story bungalow with a large gable-roofed dormer, knee braces under the eaves, and an enclosed porch. * The Church of Christ Scientist at 417 W. Wisconsin St. was built in 1933 by the local Christian Science Society, designed by Charles William Valentine of Milwaukee in Georgian Revival style, clad in limestone with a semi-circular portico and topped with a three-stage tower. The district contains examples of various architectural styles, and a typical progression is seen in the list above. The NRHP also considers the district significant for social history, since the five churches of the district contributed to unify the community, cutting across class and ethnicity.

One calls a variety locally finite if every finitely generated algebra has finite cardinality, or equivalently, if every finitely generated free algebra has finite cardinality. The variety of Boolean algebras constitutes a famous example. The free Boolean algebra on n generators has cardinality 22n, consisting of the n-ary operations 2n‚Üí2. The variety of sets constitutes a degenerate example: the free set on n generators has cardinality n, consisting of just the generators themselves. The variety of pointed sets constitutes a trivial example: the free pointed set on n generators has cardinality n+1, consisting of the generators along with the basepoint. The variety of graphs defined as follows constitutes a combinatorial example. Define a graph G = (E,s,t) to be a set E of edges and unary operations s, t of source and target satisfying s(s(e)) = t(s(e)) and s(t(e)) = t(t(e)). Vertices are those edges in the (common) image of s and t. The free graph on n generators has cardinality 3n and consists of n edges e each with two endpoints s(e) and t(e). Graphs with nontrivial incidence relations arise as quotients of free graphs, most usefully by identifying vertices. The variety of sets and the variety of graphs so defined each forms a presheaf category and hence a topos. This is not the case for the variety of Boolean algebras or of pointed sets.

The company is based in Cleveland, Ohio and has three divisions with specializations in music publishing, digital marketing and a record label. Company history The Element 9 music company was launched in 2005 as a promotional outlet for aspiring hip hop artists. The company was founded by Stu Pflaum while he was a senior at Ohio University. Pflaum formerly performed as a DJ on college radio before launching the company. Upon graduation from Ohio University, Pflaum moved the company to New York City where he split the company into two divisions, Element 9 Recordings, specializing in music publishing and Element 9.0, specializing in digital marketing. Element 9 Recordings was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2008 in the category of Best Rap Song for their role as music publisher for Crank That (Soulja Boy) by Soulja Boy. In November 2009, the record label division, Element 9 Muzik, was formed. Shortly after, the company announced a partnership with Fontana Distribution, the independent distribution arm of Universal Music Group, for international distribution for artists signed to the label. The label division is headed by music industry veteran Tony Franklin. Stu Pflaum serves as Vice President for the label. The first release from the Element 9 record label was Arms & Hammers by West Coast rap group Strong Arm Steady. The album was released in February 2011. In November 2011, the company released Habits of the Heart by Idle Warship, which is composed of rapper Talib Kweli and singer Res. Prior to the album's official street date, the label released the album through the Spotify music service. The advance release was the first instance in which a United States based music company debuted a project far in advance using the Spotify service. The move was viewed as bold by music and technology critics and a counterweight to the release strategies of artists such as Coldplay and Adele, who had refused to make their music available through Spotify.

Launched in 2011 as the spinoff of the water-related businesses of ITT Corporation, Xylem is headquartered in Rye Brook, New York, with 2018 revenues of $5.2 billion and 17,000 employees worldwide. Its products and services are focused in two areas: water infrastructure, which consists of businesses serving clean water delivery, wastewater transport and treatment, de-watering and analytical instrumentation; and applied water, which is residential and commercial building services companies, as well as industrial and agricultural applications. History On January 12, 2011, Xylem's parent, ITT Corporation announced its plan to separate the company into three, stand-alone publicly traded, independent companies\\". The future water company was named Xylem, pronounced zi-lem. (The name \\"Xylem\\", derived from classical Greek, is the tissue that transports water in plants.) It comprises three business units ‚Äì Water Solutions, Analytics, and Applied Water Systems. ITT Corporation spun off its defense businesses into a company named ITT Exelis, and retained its corporate name, logo and ‚ÄúEngineered for life‚Äù company tagline for its other activities.

Products The company from the start introduced the first commercial product in many categories: In 1952, they introduced the First quartz crystal electronic stopwatch, and the first practical electronic thermometer. In 1956, first commercial heart-lung machine, in 1957, the first instantaneous blood-gas analyzer.Company history web site accessed Feb 17, 2013 They continued development in their key area of temperature measurement. They produced the first interchangeable thermistor temperature probes in 1955, and developed it into a complete line of precision interchangeable thermistors in 1961, and in 1965 developed the first linear thermistor temperature sensor, which Industrial Research magazine recognized as one of the 100 most significant new technological products of the year. In other analytical instruments, they produced the first practical dissolved oxygen meter for field and laboratory use in 1965, which the same magazine recognized as yet another of the most significant technological products of the year. Their oxygen meter had used the technique of polarography, and they developed further products on the same principle, including t the first immobilized- enzyme-activated polarographic sensor in 1972. They then developed further biomedical instrumentation: the first commercially successful whole blood glucose analyzer in 1975, the first commercial alcohol measurement instrument using immobilized enzyme electrode technology in 1982. They continued using immobilized enzyme techniques, for the first direct whole-blood L-lactate assays using immobilized enzyme electrode also in 1982. They also continued developing thermal technology, with the first commercial gallium melting-point temperature standard (29.7715 ¬∞C) in 1977 and the first robotic-manufactured glass-encapsulated precision thermistors in 1996. They produced their first environmental monitoring instrument, a dissolved oxygen sensor, in 1992. They then developed instrumentation for conductivity measurement of ultrapure water in 1996, and the first accurate commercial fiber-optic based CO2 measurement system, in 1998. Beginning in the late 1990s, they began producing analytical software and integrated analytical instrumentation: BOD Analyst(TM), software that automates BOD testing.They also began developing integrated analytical systems: the YSI 600 QS Quick Sample multiparameter spot sampling system, the YSI 5200 Recirculating System Monitor, and the YSI 7100 Multiparameter Bioanalytical System (MBS).

Courtney Sullivan, is an American novelist and former writer for The New York Times. Biography Sullivan grew up outside Boston, Massachusetts. She attended Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts, where she majored in Victorian literature and received the Ellen M. Hatfield Memorial Prize for best short story, the Norma M. Leas prize for excellence in written English, and the Jeanne MacFarland Prize for excellent work in Women's Studies. She graduated in 2003, then moved to New York City and began working at Allure. Sullivan later moved to The New York Times, where she worked for four years. Her writing has since appeared in The New York Times Book Review, the Chicago Tribune, New York magazine, the New York Observer, Men's Vogue, Elle, and Glamour, among many others. Sullivan comes from an Irish-Catholic family where many of the women go by their middle rather than first names. Her first piece for Allure was published under the name \\"Courtney Sullivan,\\" but she added the J back in shortly thereafter. She self-identifies as a feminist, a stance that has been reflected in both her fiction and nonfiction work. In 2006, she wrote a piece for the New York Times \\"Modern Love\\" column about her experiences in the dating world, and in 2010 she co-edited a feminist essay collection titled Click: When We Knew We Were Feminists. Her novels deal prominently with relationships between female characters. In 2017, Sullivan wrote the foreword to a new edition of one of her childhood favorites, Anne of Green Gables, published by Penguin Classics. Sullivan lives with her husband, Kevin Johannesen, and their son, in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn. She was raised Roman Catholic. She now considers herself a \\"lapsed Catholic\\" but still prays and visits an abbey on retreats. Novels =Commencement= In 2010, Sullivan published her first novel, Commencement, which focuses on the experiences of four friends at Smith College, Sullivan's alma mater. She wrote 15 different drafts of the book before sending it to her editor, after which it underwent two or three more revisions. Commencement received positive reviews from many major publications and became a New York Times bestseller. Feminist icon Gloria Steinem described the novel as \\"generous-hearted, brave...Commencement makes clear that the feminist revolution is just beginning\\". In 2011, Oprah's Book Club included Commencement in a list of \\"5 Feminist Classics to (Re)read as a Mom, Wife and Writer\\". =Maine= Sullivan's second novel, Maine, deals with four women from three different generations of an Irish family named the Kellehers. The foursome includes: Alice, the stubborn and opinionated matriarch who is dealing with the guilt she has over a tragedy in the past; Ann Marie, who married into the family and is nursing her newfound love for creating dollhouses; Katherine, Alice's eldest daughter who has commuted from California to be with her daughter, Maggie; and Maggie, a kindhearted 32-year- old from New York who is dealing with her pregnancy. Each woman's world collides while spending the summer at a beachfront cottage in New England. Though Sullivan did not base the fictional family directly on her own Irish- Catholic family, she drew on her own childhood experiences while writing the novel. Maine was named a Best Book of the Year by the Washington Post and one of the top ten fiction books of 2011 by TIME magazine. It was a New York Times bestseller, and has sold half a million copies since its publication. =The Engagements= Evelyn has been married to her husband for forty years‚Äîforty years since he slipped off her first wedding ring and put his own in its place. Delphine has seen both sides of love‚Äîthe ecstatic, glorious highs of seduction, and the bitter, spiteful fury that descends when it's over. James, a paramedic who works the night shift, knows his wife's family thinks she could have done better; while Kate, partnered with Dan for a decade, has seen every kind of wedding‚Äîbeach weddings, backyard weddings, castle weddings‚Äîand has vowed never, ever, to have one of her own. As these lives and marriages unfold in surprising ways, we meet Frances Gerety, a young advertising copywriter in 1947. Frances is working on the De Beers campaign and she needs a signature line, so, one night before bed, she scribbles a phrase on a scrap of paper: \\"A Diamond Is Forever.\\" And that line changes everything. Reese Witherspoon's production company picked up the rights to The Engagements before the book was even published. Fox 2000 signed on to make the film soon thereafter. The Engagements was a New York Times bestseller, and was named a best book of the year by People Magazine and the Irish Times. It has been published in 17 countries. = Saints For All Occasions = Sullivan's fourth novel was named one of the ten best books of the year by the Washington Post, a New York Times Critic's Pick for 2017 and was a finalist for the New England Book Award. Richard Russo said, \\"I hope to read another novel as strong and wise and beautiful and heartbreaking as Saints For All Occasions this year, but I'm not sure I will.\\" Books =Fiction= *Commencement (2010) *Maine (2011) *The Engagements (2013) *Saints for All Occasions (2017) *Friends and Strangers (2020) =Nonfiction= *The Secret Currency of Love (2009) (contributing essayist) *Click: When We Knew We Were Feminists (2010) (co- editor with Courtney E.

The Partition of Albania () is a term used for the partition of the Albanian state, which proclaimed its independence on 28 November 1912. The delineation of the newly established Principality of Albania under the terms of the London Conference of 1912-1913 (29 July 1913) and the Ambassadors of the six Great Powers of that time (Great Britain, France, Germany, Austria- Hungary, Russia and Italy) left Albanian and non-Albanian populations on both sides of the border. Representatives of the Albanian national movement viewed this as a partition of claimed Albanian-inhabited territories, also territories contained in a proposed Albanian Vilayet. After the establishment of the Albanian state, there were plans to further partition Albania during World War I; however, Albania was not partitioned and maintained its independent existence. Additional plans of partition were negotiated during and after World War II. History =Prelude= vilayets clearly divided (vilayet of ƒ∞≈ükodra, Yannina, Monastir and Kosovo as proposed by the League of Prizren for full autonomy) The 1877-1878 Russo-Turkish War severely contracted the Ottoman possessions in the Balkan Peninsula, leaving the empire with only a precarious hold on Macedonia and the western Balkans. Albanians had been under Ottoman Empire since 1479 with the fall of Shkod√´r. The region claimed by Albanian national leader was ethnically heterogeneous, consisting of large areas inhabited also by Bulgarians, Greeks, Serbians, Turks and Aromanians, though Sami Frash√´ri (or ≈ûemseddin Sami) claimed that Albanians were the majority of the population in the four vilayets of ƒ∞≈ükodra, Yannina, Monastir and Kosovo. The first postwar treaty, the abortive Treaty of San Stefano signed on 3 March 1878, assigned Albanian-populated lands to Serbia, Montenegro, and Bulgaria. Austria-Hungary and the United Kingdom blocked the arrangement because it awarded Russia a predominant position in the Balkans and thereby upset the European balance of power. A peace conference to settle the dispute was held later in the year in Berlin. The Congress of Berlin ceded to Montenegro the cities of Bar and Podgorica and areas around the mountain villages of Gusinje and Plav, which Albanian leaders considered Albanian territory,and viewed this as a partition of Albanian-inhabited territories. In February 1879, the Powers insisted that the Porte give up the Albanian-claimed areas of Plava, Podgorica, Gucia and Ulcinj, and withdraw all Ottoman troops from the disputed zones. =Congress of Berlin= Albanians view the Congress of Berlin as the partition of some of the Albanian-inhabited territories, which Albanians considered to be part of the Albanian Vilayet. The congress ceded to Montenegro the cities of Bar and Podgorica and areas around the mountain villages of Gusinje and Plav. The Albanians created the League of Prizren to counter the loss of territories where Albanians were a majority, and organized armed resistance efforts in Gusinje and Plav, where the Montenegrin forces were met by fierce resistance. A border tribesman at the time described the frontier as \\"floating on blood\\". Seeing the resistance, the Congress decided to give Ulcinj to Montenegro. The League of Prizren was forces to retreat from Ulcinj, after being crushed by the Ottoman army led by Dervish Pasha. =Balkan Wars= Albanian Declaration of Independence in Vlor√´ 1912. On 8 October 1912, Montenegrin troops marched in the vilayet of Shkodra. That was followed by Serbia, Bulgaria, and Greece to declare war on Ottoman Empire, thus starting the First Balkan War. Montenegrin, Serbian and Greek forces advanced in territories which were majorly populated by Albanians, and tried to change the ethnic reality through extermination of the Albanian population, with around 25 000 Albanians killed by early 1913. Alarmed at the plans of Montenegro, Serbia and Greece to partition between them the territories of the western Balkans, the Albanians delegates met at a congress in Vlor√´, where on 28 November 1912 declared the independence of Albania. On 3 December 1912, the ambassadors of the six Great Powers of that time (Great Britain, France, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Russia and Italy) met in London to decide about the fate of the Albanian-inhabited territories. After much discussion, the Ambassadors reached a formal decision on 29 July 1913 to establish the Principality of Albania which independence would be recognized, but more than half of the territory of the Independent Albania and about 30%-40% of the ethnic Albanian population would be awarded to Serbia, Montenegro, and Greece. Though deprived of more than half of its ethnic territory, Albania would be a sovereign state independent of the Ottoman Empire. =Delineation of the Albanian border= A number of boundary commissions were sent in Albania in order to delineate the borders of the new state, on an ethnographic basis, according to the terms of the London Peace Conferences. However, the commission being unable to delineate the area of southern Albania on such a basis, fell back upon economic, strategic and geographical arguments for the delimitation of the southern border. As a result, most of the disputed area was left to Albania. This decision catalyzed an uprising among the local Greek population, which declared the population of the region that was temporary settled by the Protocol of Corfu. Declaration of the Northern Epirote Independence in Gjirokast√´r, against annexation of the region to the newly established Albanian state. Plans for further partition of Albania After the establishment of the Albanian state, in 1912, there were plans to further partition Albania during World War I. In 1915, a secret treaty signed in London included the partitioning of the country, As part of this treaty, in 1919 an agreement was signed between Italy and Greece that included plans of annexation of Albania between the two countries. According to this agreement, known as Venizelos‚ÄìTittoni agreement, signed on 20 July 1919, Northern Epirus (parts of southern Albania) would be incorporated to Greece, while Greece would recognize an Italian mandate for central Albania. Before the Italian invasion of Albania in 1939, there were discussions concerning partition between Yugoslavia and Italy. On the other hand, in 1944, while Albania came under communist control, a resolution of the United States Senate supported the cession of Northern Epirus to Greece. Aftermath Any plans of partition of the Albanian state were unsuccessful and Albania retained its 1913 territories (pictured). The borders of the Principality of Albania established in 1913 left a large number of ethnic Albanians outside the new state, and many of them fled or were forcibly driven inside the recognized borders of Albania. In Kosovo, Serbian troops attempted to alter the demographic makeup of the region through mass expulsions. Over 100,000 Albanians emigrated from Kosovo during 1918-1941.

History The Summer Meltdown was founded by Pacific Northwest band Flowmotion in 2000, as a community-based music festival on San Juan Island, with coordination and execution handled by members of Flowmotion and friends of the band. Flowmotion performed as the headliner of the festival.\\"Herald.net article describing the festival\\" In 2002, Lewis Anderson and Andrea Wood became key members of the coordination efforts, which included development of an official volunteer program, ticketing system, logistical planning, and county petitioning and permitting attempts. In consecutive years, they each took on more responsibilities, securing insurance, setting up vending program, providing web copy and coordinating media efforts, and handling site logistics. Flowmotion continued to perform as the headliner of the festival until 2011. By 2005, the Summer Meltdown had reached a critical growth stage and it was no longer possible to throw the event as a party, without official county permitting. The event had long since moved off San Juan Island and had occurred in three different venues in three different counties. Event coordinators agreed to take a hiatus that year and look to a future re- grouping in 2006. In 2006 the festival moved to its current location in Darrington, Washington, sharing the Whitehorse Mountain Amphitheater with the Darrington Bluegrass Festival. The festival property is also known as the Darrington Bluegrass Park. Because of the diverse musical variety at Summer Meltdown, the festival producers decided to create a venue name that did not include bluegrass in the name, hence the name, Whitehorse Mountain Amphitheater.

He was a member of the Comintern, editor in chief of the party newspaper Die Rote Fahne and a member of the Reichstag.  Biography Born in Berlin into a middle-class family, Neumann studied philology and came into contact with Marxist ideas. In 1920, he was admitted into the Communist Party by Ernst Reuter, then General Secretary. August Thalheimer took him under his wing. Neumann began writing editorials for various KPD newspapers in 1921. He dropped out of university in 1922 and became editor of the Rote Fahne (Red Flag). He was arrested and spent six months in prison, during which he took up Russian, learning it so well, he could speak to Soviet party officials without an interpreter. In 1922, he met Joseph Stalin on a trip, speaking to him in Russian. From that point until 1932, he was a strong supporter of Stalin. He first belonged to the left wing of the KPD, led by Ruth Fischer. In 1923, he aligned himself with Arthur Ewert and Gerhart Eisler and became the political leader of the party's Mecklenburg district. He participated in the Hamburg Uprising and in 1924, had to flee to Vienna, from where he was expelled to the Soviet Union in 1925. There, he succeeded Ivan Katz as Communist Party representative to the Comintern. From July to December 1927, he represented the Comintern in China. Working with Georgian communist Vissarion Lominadze, he helped Chinese communists to organize the Guangzhou Uprising on 11 December 1927. The rebellion was a complete failure and resulted in great casualties. Chinese communist leader Zhang Guotao blamed Neumann for this, claiming that the German had insisted that Guangzhou should be held at all cost against a National Revolutionary Army counter-offensive although this was not feasible for the local communists. Neumann went back to Germany in 1928 and after the Wittorf Affair, became one of the most important politicians of the KPD. He was considered the major theoretician of the party and became editor in chief of the Rote Fahne. As the chief ideologist, he was responsible for the ultra-left policies, the Revolution√§re Gewerkschafts Opposition and the social fascism policy. At the same time, he encouraged fighting the Nazis and coined the slogan \\"Schlagt die Faschisten, wo ihr sie trefft!\\" (Beat the Fascists wherever you meet them!), valid until 1932. Along with fellow member of the Reichstag Hans Kippenberger, Neumann was the leader of the KPD's paramilitary wing, the Party Self Defense Unit (). As such, Neumann had a major role in the 1931 assassination of Paul Anlauf and Franz Lenck, both of whom were SPD members and Precinct Captains in the Berlin Police. Elected to the Reichstag in 1930, in 1931, Neumann began to disagree with both Stalin and KPD leader Ernst Th√§lmann. Neumann felt that by focussing on toppling the ruling SPD, the KPD was underestimating the danger of a takeover by the Nazi Party. He was defeated in October 1932, relieved of his party functions in November 1932, and lost his seat in the Reichstag. He was sent to Spain to represent the Comintern, then lived illegally in Switzerland. In September 1933, the public prosecutor of Berlin, based on the confessions of 15 of his co-conspirators, charged Neumann with first degree murder for his involvement in the murders of Captains Anlauf and Lenck. In January 1934, while still a fugitive from the German police, Neumann was accused of having tried to split the KPD, he was forced to write a \\"self criticism\\". In late 1934, he was arrested in Zurich by the Swiss immigration authorities and was imprisoned for six months, after which, he was expelled. He was sent to the Soviet Union, where he fell victim to the Great Purge. Death Heinz Neumann was arrested by the NKVD on 27 April 1937. On November 26, 1937, he was sentenced to death by the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union. He was shot on the same day. Personal life Heinz Neumann began dating Margarete Buber-Neumann in 1929 and later lived in unmarried union with her. After he disappeared in the Great Purge, she was also arrested and served time in the GULAG. After the Nazi-Soviet Pact, Buber- Neumann was handed over to the Nazi Gestapo along with many other KPD members whom Stalin had sent to the GULAG. After her return to Germany, Buber-Neumann was imprisoned by the Nazis in Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp, but survived to write her memoirs of both the GULAG and the Nazi death camps. After her release, Buber-Neumann spent the remainder of her life as an outspoken believer in the moral equivalency of Naziism and Communism.

Raymon and nicknamed Mr. Show Business was a leading Australian entrepreneur, theatre and concert promoter, producer and artist manager, whose professional career lasted from the mid-1940s until his retirement in 1980. Career  Kenn Brodziak was born in 1913 in the Sydney suburb of Waverley. Although his family wanted him to have a law career, Brodziac was more interested in theatre and aspiring to be a playwright.Live Performance. Retrieved 25 June 2016 He started his career in 1945, as an assistant producer on the local vaudeville circuit and over his long career, via his Melbourne- based company Aztec Services, arranged Australian concerts and tours by a wide range of acts, both locally and internationally including: Winifred Atwell, Gene Pitney, Marlene Dietrich, The Kinks, Sophie Tucker, Normie Rowe, Carol Channing, The Seekers, The Easybeats, Pat Boone, Fabian, Sid James, Cilla Black, The Dave Clark Five, Duane Eddy, Robert Morley, Bob Dylan, Lonnie Donegan, Cliff Richard, Dave Brubeck, Marcel Marceau, Eartha Kitt and Jack Benny. Bringing the BBC's Black and White Minstrel Show for a proposed 6-month tour of both Australia and New Zealand was an unprecedented success, held over for three years from 1962 to 1965, and breaking every box office record in both countries, a record which still stands. The Beatles Australian tour Brodziak's most celebrated achievement in this area was arranging the Beatles' 16-day Australian tour of 1964. He had seen the Beatles perform during a talent-scouting trip to Britain in 1963, and agreed to handle and promote the group's Australian tour just prior to the explosion of Beatlemania in Australia, for Stadiums Limited which owned most of the large capital city venues including the Brisbane Festival Hall, the Melbourne Festival Hall, the Centennial Hall in Adelaide and the Sydney Stadium. By the time the Beatles actually arrived in Australia in the summer of 1964, they had gone from unknowns to superstars, having already scored 12 hits on the Australian pop charts. The tour was a runaway success, bringing Brodziak a level of fame in Australia he had never before experienced. In 1998, he acknowledged that, in spite of his many other achievements, bringing the Fab Four to Australia was probably the single most memorable moment of his career: > \\"It used to annoy me that people only knew me for bringing The Beatles here. > Now I realise what a landmark moment that was. There will never be another > group like them.\\" Theatre productions Though he would continue to book concerts, later in his career Brodziak also concentrated on producing stage shows. These shows included the successful Australian productions of The Boys in the Band, Godspell, Pippin, Hair and A Chorus Line. After retiring in 1980, Brodziak concentrated on adding to and developing his extensive collection of showbiz memorabilia. Honours Brodziak was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1978 for services to theatre.It's an Honour.

It was established during the 1810s, with the main house and numerous outbuildings built by Samuel Pierre Auguste Fagot between 1829 and 1843. Once renowned as one of the most intact and architecturally-unified plantation complexes in the Southeastern United States, all of the structures were demolished to make way for construction of a new river levee in 1940. It was recorded by the Historic American Buildings Survey prior to its destruction. History The plantation was established by Colonel Joseph Constance when he acquired several tracts of land at the location following the War of 1812. Pierre Auguste Samuel Fagot, usually known as Samuel Fagot, acquired the plantation and other St. James Parish properties beginning in 1829. A native of La Rochelle, France, he emigrated to the United States and was living in the vicinity of Convent by 1828. He married Emilie Jourdain and had two daughters, Marie Emilie Eugenie and Felicie. Marie Emilie Eugenie married Jacques Auguste Demophon Tureaud and Felicie married Lucien Malus. By the time of Samuel Fagot's death in 1858, he was one of the largest landowners in St. James Parish. The plantation went to his widow after his death, but his son-in-law, Lucien Malus, operated the plantation. Following the Civil War, the plantation, which had been called Constancia up until that time, came to be called Uncle Sam instead. Many different stories have attempted to explain the name. One is that it came from the sugar containers from the plantation being marked for export with \\"U.S.\\" for the nation of origin. Others claim that it referred to Samuel Fagot himself. None has been confirmed by historians. Aerial perspective drawing of Uncle Sam Plantation (1940) Felicie and Lucien Malus had two daughters, Emelie and Felicie. They married two brothers, Jules and Camile Jacob. Following the death of Lucien Malus, the Jacob brothers operated the plantation. Jules later bought Camile's share and was the sole owner of the plantation until selling in 1915 to a New Orleans businessman. The plantation's main house would never be lived in again after this transaction, although the estate continued to be operated as an agricultural enterprise. In early 1940 the Pontchartrain Levee District commissioners determined that the only way to fix structural problems in the river levee would be to build a new one over the site. Demolition quickly followed. On March 12, 1940, as demolition was nearing completion, the United States Army Corps of Engineers office in New Orleans received a telegram from the director of the National Park Service asking that demolition be delayed until an investigation could be completed to determine if the site might be given National Monument or National Historic Site status. However, it was too late to save the plantation complex. Following the demolition, 300,000 bricks from Uncle Sam were used in the restoration of another extensive plantation complex nearby, Evergreen Plantation in Wallace. A chemical plant, now owned by the Mosaic Company, was later built on the site. A historic marker was erected in 1969, the only reminder of what once was there. Architecture Front (west) facade of one of the two matching garconni√®res and the main house (1938) The first brick buildings that Samuel Fagot built, and that would remain a part of the final design of the complex, were matching temple-like structures that housed the plantation office and the kitchen. The one-story, stuccoed brick buildings were each fronted by a tetrastyle portico with Tuscan columns. They flanked the north and south sides of the main house toward the rear (east) and measured wide by deep. The foundations for the main house were started in the mid-to-late 1830s, with construction being completed in 1841 or 1843. A previous, smaller main house had been destroyed by fire. The new main house was stories tall and measured wide by deep. It was topped with a pyramidal metal roof with dormers. The front facade faced west, toward the river. The brick exterior was stuccoed and scored to simulate ashlar masonry. It was surrounded by a peripteral (on all four sides) portico utilizing 28 monumentally-scaled Tuscan columns. A continuous balcony with a simple Roman- style balustrade wrapped around the exterior of the second floor. One of the two matching pigeonnier towers to the rear of the main house, with former slave cabins in the background (1937). The interior was divided by a central hallway that ran from front to rear on both levels and measured wide by deep. On each side of the hallway, on both main levels, were several small rooms and two large rooms. The large rooms all measured by . Additionally, a large main stairway was set into a side hall at the rear of the main hall. Flanking the north and south sides of the main house toward the front (west) were a pair of matching garconni√®res (bachelors' quarters). Garconni√®res, unique to Louisiana Creole plantations, were built for the unmarried young men and guests of the plantation. It was custom that once a boy reached adolescence, he was housed separately from the unmarried girls and women. Also built of scored stucco over brick, they were stories tall and measured wide by deep. These matched the main house, with a hexastyle portico set under the roof on the front and rear facades. Each garconni√®re was topped by a pyramidal roof with dormers facing the front and rear. Both of them featured a central hall and four adjoining rooms on the primary floor. Among the most unusual features of the plantation were two matching pigeonnier (dovecote) towers set to the north and south of the main house in the rear yard. These hexagonal structures were also built of brick and stood high. They were used for raising pigeons for eggs and squab.

It is the sequel to its 2005 predecessor Sniper Elite, which takes place in the same timeframe and location‚Äîthe Battle of Berlin in April‚ÄìMay 1945‚Äîbut with an altered narrative. The game's story follows an American Office of Strategic Services officer who must capture or eliminate the scientists involved in the German V-2 rocket program while the Red Army invades. A prequel named Sniper Elite III was released in 2014. A remastered version for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One was released on May 14, 2019. Gameplay If a successful sniper kill shot is made, the \\"Kill-Cam\\" shows the camera following the bullet from the rifle to the target, with its entry and exit in X-Ray vision. Sniper Elite V2 is a third-person tactical shooter that emphasises a less direct approach to combat, encouraging the player as a sniper to use stealth and keep distance from enemy soldiers. Many of the single player levels allow multiple routes for the players to take, including multi-story buildings and side streets to get vantage points and avoid direct firefights. Set in World War II, the player character utilises appropriate weapons for the era. The sniper rifle is the primary weapon throughout the game, though additional side arms are available including submachine guns and pistols, silenced or not depending on the situation. In addition to hand grenades, the player can deploy them as tripwire booby traps, land mines and dynamite. Binoculars can be used to tag enemies in view, displaying their position and movements to player. When using the sniper rifle however, certain elements can determine the outcome of a shot, taking realistic ballistics into consideration including wind direction and strength and bullet drop potentially altering the shot through the scope. Bullets can ricochet off surfaces or targets and strike others. In different postures such as crouching or lying down on the front can also steady a shot, however the player character also has the ability to take a deep breath to further steady a shot and from their perspective slow down time. Another ability is when the player character is spotted, their last movements and position to the enemy is shown as a white-outlined figure, potentially allowing the player to escape that area and avoid further detection and alarms being raised. A major feature of V2 is the \\"X-Ray Kill Cam\\" where upon a successful and skilled shot will in slow motion follow the bullet from the sniper rifle to the target where upon impact will show an anatomically correct x-ray style reveal of the body part being hit and the damage the bullet causes to the organs and bones. Sniping can also be used to shoot the enemies' own grenades triggering an explosion. This method can also be used against military vehicles by targeting fuel tanks and valves. The game will also measure notable shots by briefly displaying distance and other factors like whether it was a head shot or moving target. =Multiplayer= V2 supports online multiplayer where players engage in cooperative play in a series of game modes. Kill Tally is a mode where two players fend off increasingly numerous and difficult waves of enemy soldiers and vehicles in an enclosed environment with an infinite supply point of ammunition and explosives. While players can compete for higher kill counts, both must keep each other alive and work together. Bombing Run is a mission based mode where players must search the environment in order to repair a truck to escape before the entire area is bombed. The third mode is Overwatch where two players take different roles to complete an objective with one player as the operative who undertakes said objectives, armed with short range firearms and binoculars that can be used to tag enemies for the second player who takes the role of a sniper who covers the operative throughout. In addition to these separate game modes, missions from the single player campaign can also be played with two players. The Wii U version of the game however omits multiplayer, leaderboard and co-op modes. Plot The main character is Lieutenant Karl Fairburne (Tom Clarke-Hill), an American OSS officer and skilled sniper who is inserted into Berlin in 1945, during the final days of World War II. It references Operation Paperclip and its predecessor Operation Overcast, the plan by the US to recruit the scientists of Nazi Germany. Fairburne comes up against both Nazi and Soviet opponents as he tracks key individuals involved with the development of the V-2 ballistic missile. The campaign begins with Fairburne sent into Berlin to first assassinate German Major-General Hans von Eisenberg who was attempting to defect to the Soviets. Shortly after, he is given the mission to eliminate Doctor Gunther Kreidl, a Nazi scientist who is being led out of the city in a convoy. After laying an ambush, Fairburne escapes with the doctor's personal documents revealing further information about the V-2 rocket program including the location of other scientists. As the only American within the region, he is sent to the outskirts of the city to infiltrate a V-2 production facility in search of another scientist, Dr. Schwaiger. While the scientist is absent, Fairburne learns that he originally made plans to defect to the United States, before sabotaging and escaping the facility. US intelligence then sends him into Opernplatz where the Soviets are in full invading force. As the Soviets and Germans engage one another, Fairburne slips by and saves Schwaiger from being executed by Nazi officers after his plans to defect were discovered. However, in the ensuing firefight, Schwaiger is mortally wounded and in his dying words states that \\"Wolff has a plan\\" and the unknown word \\"tabun\\". Following these events, Fairburne continues to track and eliminate the remaining scientists, assassinating Doctor M√ºller in his command tower during a series of bombing raids on the city. With no location of the V-2 launching site, Fairburne infiltrates and searches the Soviet HQ. There he finds that documents revealing that tabun is actually a nerve gas that is to be carried by the V-2 rockets. As a last act of revenge the remaining scientist Doctor Wolff intends to launch them at London. With only the information that location is somewhere outside Berlin, Fairburne goes to Wolff's offices within the city to find more information. However, by the time he arrives the office has been already destroyed, yet Fairburne is able to find a ripped notebook and learns that Wolff is about to escape from an airfield. Fairburne retrieves a map detailing V-2 storage facilities and sets out to destroy the rockets before they can be launched. He arrives at the launch site with minutes until launch. After destroying the rocket, and with only Wolff left, Fairburne goes back to the Brandenburg Gate, where he had assassinated von Eisenberg few days earlier. Fairburne climbs on top of the structure and, as Wolff is about to escape in a car, shoots and kills Wolff, causing the car to lose control and flip over. Fairburne remarks that World War II is over but the Cold War has just begun, in which he has acted as the first soldier. Development In 2011, Rebellion announced that it was co-publishing the title with 505 Games. Due for release in May 2012, the game was described as a \\"reboot\\" of the original Sniper Elite, rather than a sequel. The initial announcement however only referred to a release on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, absent a PC version. Following a strong response from PC users, Rebellion announced it was to self-publish a PC version through shops and via the Steam online games download retailer to be released at the same time as the console versions. On 5 February 2013, Rebellion announced a version for Nintendo's Wii U console is in development. Following the initial release, a second retail version of the game was released for the PC only called the \\"High Command Edition\\" on 12 October 2012. This version included an updated version of original V2 game, the previous pre-order bonus \\"Assassinate the Fuhrer\\", new multiplayer maps and mode updates and a then previously unreleased new single player mission and weapons. Many of the features would be later released online separately. The PC version was released for a third time on 15 March 2013 as part of the \\"Collector's Edition\\", this time including the original game, all downloadable content released up to that date (both single and multiplayer), an audio soundtrack, printed full-colour art book and the original Sniper Elite game. In the same month the PS3 and 360 console versions were re-released as the \\"Game of the Year Edition\\" in Europe and the \\"Silver Star Edition\\" in North America that only include the downloadable content. The game is AMD Eyefinity validated. Downloadable content Originally bundled as a pre-order bonus download with the main game on its release, the first piece of downloadable content is a self-contained single player mission separate from the main campaign, titled \\"Assassinate the F√ºhrer\\". The mission involves an alternate historical scenario where Fairburne is sent to Salzburg to intercept a convey in order to assassinate Adolf Hitler before he escapes the area via train. Following the game's release, the DLC was released to non-pre-order players across all platforms on 5 June 2012. The second DLC mission is \\"The Neudorf Outpost Pack\\" was released on 20 September 2012 for the PC and on 18 December 2012 for consoles. The mission concerns the demolition of a German-controlled fuel dump in the Harz Mountains and includes two new exclusive weapons. The third DLC mission is \\"The Landwehr Canal Pack\\" was released on 18 October 2012 and includes three new weapons. The mission required multiple German generals to be assassinated as they meet in night-time Berlin, thus being challenging and requiring planning. At the same time a new multiplayer mode was released for free through Steam called \\"Dog Tag Harvest Mode\\", where players collect points only after a fallen soldier's dog tag has been collected. The fourth DLC missions is \\"St. Pierre\\" was released on 6 February 2013 and also includes three new weapons. The missions involves the assassination of \\"General Rodebrecht\\", a rising star in the German army whose death could turn the tide of the war for the Allies. On 7 November 2012, Rebellion released a \\"Multiplayer Expansion\\" for free on PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The new online multiplayer modes support competitive play between players including traditional deathmatch and team deathmatch modes while introducing \\"distance king\\", both solo and team based where players' success is measured by the distance of shots. Another mode is \\"No Cross\\", a variant on the other modes where teams are separated to two sides of a map, requiring long range firefights only. In addition to the new game types, six new maps for use in multiplayer were also included. At the same time, a paid piece of DLC was also released involving a new selection of weapons. Spin-offs and re-releases =Nazi Zombie Army= A separate stand-alone title called Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Armyhttp://www.pcgamer.com/2013/02/14/sniper-elite-nazi-zombie-army- shuffles-into-the-room/ was released following V2 on 28 February 2013 as a standalone expansion. It was initially available as a digital download through Steam; it was supposed to get a retail release but with no publisher for the title, and has not been released on consoles. The game is also developed by Rebellion and built from the same engine and template as V2, features the same mechanics and gameplay yet presents completely separate game modes (both single and multiplayer). The premise is that during the final days of World War II, with the German army close to defeat, Adolf Hitler deploys a last resort plan to raise the fallen as zombies through occult rituals and turn them against Allied forces, causing Germany to be overrun with the undead. The game features a series of campaign missions that can be played in single- player mode, or with up to four players in online co-op. The level structure has been compared to the Left 4 Dead series, involving missions with specific objectives requiring players to fight their way through levels containing various types of enemy zombie. Checkpoints break up each campaign with safe houses, allowing players to stock up on weapons and ammunition. =Nazi Zombie Army 2= A sequel named Nazi Zombie Army 2 was released on 31 October 2013 where the player has to find the fragments of the Sagamartha Relic, the key to controlling the zombies while facing newer, deadlier enemies. =Zombie Army Trilogy= Another sequel was announced on 8 January 2015 and released 6 March 2015, alongside the remastered versions of Nazi Zombie Army and Nazi Zombie Army 2, under the package Zombie Army Trilogy for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Due to German censorship of Nazi-related symbols, both games were released as just Zombie Army in Germany. =Sniper Elite V2 Remastered= Developer Rebellion Developments announced in March 2019 that an enhanced version of the game would launch that year for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-03-14-rebellion-announces-four- new-sniper-elite-games-in-development In April 2019, Rebellion Developments had confirmed that the remaster will release on 14 May 2019. The new version contains multiple playable characters (including those from Zombie Army Trilogy), updated graphics and a photo-mode for screenshots. Reception Sniper Elite V2 received mixed reviews. In a review for GamesRadar, Matt Hughes favourably compared V2 against the original Sniper Elite in regards to the mission structure and variety, stating that \\"V2 keeps the objectives varied and avoids tedium by condensing and refining the physical scope of the game\\". Similarly Nathan Meunier at IGN praised the single player, feeling that it \\"delivers a satisfying trek through a well-designed medley of war-torn cityscapes ripe with tactical opportunities for assassination and covert sneakery\\". While he noted the multiplayer, \\"Overwatch\\" was considered the stand out mode \\"where multiplayer really gets cool\\" as \\"these missions require careful collaborative teamwork, and they're a ton of fun.\\" In a mixed response however, GameTrailers felt that the single player varied in quality, where \\"things take a turn for the worse when you're doing anything other than sniping\\", particularly in regards to close-quarter stealth segments in what the review considered to be \\"a real drag\\" causing \\"unbearable\\" trial-and- error. However, in the same review, it felt that the option to play the campaign cooperatively \\"remedies many of our complaints\\". Phil Savage of PC Gamer took issue with apparent inconsistencies between levels, favouring the more open-ended missions that \\"rewards you with the feeling of carefully thought-out mischief falling into place\\", as opposed to tighter levels where \\"in these moments the game devolves into a pop-up shooting gallery\\". Savage also praised the \\"tactical systems and satisfying ballistics\\" while being critical of \\"uncanny enemy vision\\". A recurring feature noted in reviews was the \\"X-Ray Kill Cam\\". Official Xbox Magazine reviewer Chuck Osborne said that it \\"earns the game's Mature rating and our applause\\" while Tim Turi of Game Informer called it the game's \\"standout feature\\" that \\"never got old\\". GameSpot reviewer Chris Watters called the feature \\"brutal and gratuitous (perhaps too much so, for some)\\" yet still enjoyed it as a \\"delightfully gory\\" highlight. Marsh Davis of Eurogamer echoed this view by stating that \\"Its appeal is most definitely crass but, oddly, these animations also give each enemy's death a ghoulish significance.\\" The game has sold half a million copies on Steam. Prequel A third entry in the Sniper Elite series was announced in March 2013. Sniper Elite III takes place in North Africa during World War II and has been described as \\"more of a sandbox game\\". Of the choice of gameplay, Kingsley stated that \\"We want you to feel you're dealing with scenarios that are believable and that you can genuinely make meaningful choices on how to tackle them.\\" References Category:2012 video games Category:505 Games Category:Cold War video games Category:Cultural depictions of Adolf Hitler Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Rebellion Developments games Category:Sniper Elite Category:Sniper video games Category:Spy video games Category:Stealth video games Category:Tactical shooter video games Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games about Nazi Germany Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Video games set in 1945 Category:Video games set in Austria Category:Video games set in Berlin Category:Video games set in Germany Category:Wii U eShop games Category:Wii U games Category:Windows games Category:World War II video games Category:Xbox 360 games Category:Xbox One games ","title":"Sniper Elite V2"},{"id":"34560833","text":"Cystodium may refer to: * Cystodium (plant), a genus of ferns * Cystodium (fungus), a genus of fungi ","title":"Cystodium"},{"id":"34560842","text":"The Fiji Commerce Commission is a statutory organisation responsible for fair trade, competition (economics) and consumer protection regulation in the Fiji Islands. It was initially established in 1998 under the Commerce Act 1998 [Fiji]. The Commission is an independent statutory body that seeks to protect consumers and businesses from restrictive and unfair trade practices. When it was established, the Commission was principally responsible for enforcing Fiji's competition policies and laws. It was modelled on the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. In 2010 the Fiji government passed the Commerce Commission Act 2010http://www.paclii.org/fj/promu/promu_dec/ccd2010220/ which saw the Commission taken on extra responsibilities that notably included price control. Two of Fiji's regulatory agencies, the Department of Fair Trading & Consumer Affairs and the Prices & Incomes Board ceased to exist as separate entities following this new law. The functions, operations and staff of the two agencies are now merged into the Commerce Commission.  Functions http://www.commcomm.gov.fj/  The Commission is tasked with: * the maintenance of a register of access agreements; * the facilitation of negotiations about access to infrastructure facilities or services under access regimes * the arbitration of disputes about access to infrastructure facilities or services under access regimes; * the modification or revocation of licensing conditions in accordance with relevant laws relating to a regulated industry if referred to the Commission by the delegating authority under that law; * the collection, examination and dissemination of information on matters affecting or likely to affect the interests of consumers and businesses; * investigation of complaints regarding deceptive practices such as misuse of market power, collusion and price fixing, collective tendering and bid rigging, blatant and systematic disregard for fair trade practices and non-compliance. * if sought, advise and assist consumers and businesses on matters affecting or likely to affect their interests whether in a negotiation or the acquisition of goods or services; and * the review of commercial activities for the purposes of fixing and declaring maximum prices and where need be quantities for goods, services and rents. The Commission works closely with the Consumer Council of Fiji particularly on matters affecting consumers rights. = Brief History = With the introduction of the Commerce Commission Act in 1998, the Fiji government established a four-member Commerce Commission in October of the same year. The Commission was dissolved by the Fiji Labour Party government in 1999. Following the 2000 Fijian coup d'√©tat, a new Commission was appointed in October 2000 by the then interim government. In March 2004 the Commission set up its main office at the Garden City Complex in Suva expanding in 2010 to Lautoka, and Labasa. The Commission Secretariat is headed by the Chief Executive Officer, currently Mr Joel Abraham, who holds a Double Masters (Professional Accounting, International Relations & Diplomacy), he also holds a Post graduate Diploma in Climate Change. The current commissioners include: the Chairman, Joann Young, a consultant with the UN; Deputy Chair Firoz Ghazali; lawyer Lyanne Vaurasi, Vimlesh Sagar - chief financial officer FBC, entrepreneur Romil Patel - founder and director of Jewels Fiji, and Isikeli Tikoduadua - a telecommunications director and former CEO of Home Finance Bank .

The project was abandoned when Poland was invaded. Design and development In late 1930s the Polish Army sought several replacements for the rapidly aging PZL P.11c, the backbone of Polish aviation of the epoch. One of the specifications issued by the new commander of Polish aviation General J√≥zef ZajƒÖc in the spring of 1939 was for a Jockey- class plane, a light, inexpensive and easy to produce interceptor. The plane was to use a cheaper, less powerful radial engine than more advanced multi- purpose fighters. The Jockeys were to be used in accordance with the French concept of \\"chimney flights\\", that is for aerial defence of valuable factories and other military targets behind friendly lines. For that purpose they needed less speed, but more manoeuvrability and a faster rate of climb. The plane was to rise quickly after the alarm is sounded and attack formations of enemy bombers in a dive, thus enhancing its speed. One of such fighters designed and produced in France was the Caudron C.710. Three Polish aircraft design studios produced designs to that specification. All were to be powered by the Gnome- Rh√¥ne Mars radial engine. The Podlaska Wytw√≥rnia Samolot√≥w created the PWS-42, the Pa≈Ñstwowe Zak≈Çady Lotnicze created the PZL.45 Sok√≥≈Ç. The last to propose a new design was the RWD, with its RWD-25 by Jerzy Drzewiecki and Tadeusz Chyli≈Ñski, Henryk Millicer, Jan Idzikowski. The RWD 25 was proposed as a single-seat cantilever low-wing monoplane fighter powered by an Gnome-Rh√¥ne Mars 14M05 radial engine. It was to be armed with four wing-mounted KMO wz.37 \\"Szczeniak\\" machine-guns. The construction was to be mixed for cheaper and faster production: steel fuselage frame covered with linen and plywood. The wings were to be made entirely of wood. For lighter weight and cheaper production, the design included a fixed landing gear, though it is probable that the eventual series would have a retractable landing gear. Although the RWD received orders for a prototype and a full-scale mock-up for further tests, the outbreak of World War II interrupted the development and no planes were ever built.

Although it is known as a \\"Hindu- Buddhist temple\\", on account of added Tamil-Hindu influences, the main statue in the most important hall is that of Vairocana Buddha, the main Buddha according to Huayan Buddhism. What is now called the Mahavira Hall (Mahavira = the Great and Strong) is in fact the Vairocana Hall. History It was originally built in 685 or 686 during the Tang dynasty (618-907). The temple situated in the Mulberry garden of landlord Huang Shougong () who was said to dream of a monk begging land from him for building a temple. He donated his garden and changed it into a temple with the name of \\"Lotus Temple\\" (). In 738 in the Tang dynasty, it was renamed \\"Kaiyuan Temple\\", which is still in use now. Behind its main hall \\"Mahavira Hall\\", there are some columns with fragments as well is vigraha (idol) of Lord Vishnu from a Vishnu temple built in 1283 by the Tamil Ainnurruvar Valanjiyar Merchant community in Quanzhou. The carvings are dispersed across five primary sites in Quanzhou and the neighboring areas. They were made in the South Indian style, and share close similarities with 13th-century temples constructed in the Chola Nadu region in Tamil Nadu. Nearly all of the carvings were carved with greenish-gray granite, which was widely available in the nearby hills and used in the region's local architecture. In 1983, the Kaiyuan Temple was designated as a national temple. The Silk trade by sea brought the South Indians to China and the Chinese to Southern Indian ports and it is very likely the Indians took the knowledge of Silk cultivation and fabrics from China back to India. China had a significant influence on South India; examples of Chinese fishing nets in Kochi and fine china pottery still referred to as ‚ÄúChini chatti‚Äù or Chinese pot in Malayalam and Tamil. Architecture Along the central axis are the Four Heavenly Kings Hall, Mahavira Hall, Sweet Dew Altar of Precepts and Buddhist Texts Library. There are over 10 halls and rooms on both sides, including Tanyue Ancestral Temple, Virtue Hall and Zunsheng Hall. =Hall of Four Heavenly Kings= The Hall of Four Heavenly Kings () was built in the Tang dynasty (618-907). It serves as the Shanmen of the temple. In front of the hall, a wooden plaque with a couplet is hung on the hall. It says \\"Here is the so called Buddha State, the street are all Saints\\" (). It was composed by Song dynasty scholar Zhu Xi and inscribed by eminent monk Hong Yi. =Mahavira Hall= The Mahavira Hall () was originally built in 686 in the Tang dynasty (618-907) and the extant buildings are relics of the late Ming dynasty (1368-1644).

They are known as \\"Five Buddha\\". =Zhenguo Pagoda= Zhenguo Pagoda () is a five-storey wooden pagoda first built in 865 in the Tang dynasty (618-907). But it was destroyed and rebuilt into stone pagoda in 1238 in the Song dynasty (960-1276). The pagoda was octagonal with five storeys. Every storey is carved with sixteen reliefs with a total of 80 vivid human figures. =Renshou Pagoda= The Renshou Pagoda () was built in 917 in the Later Liang dynasty (907-923). In 1114 in the Song dynasty, it was renamed \\"Renshou Pagoda\\" by the Emperor Huizong. It is high and has the similar with the Zhenguo Pagoda. =Sweet Dew Altar of Precepts= The Sweet Dew Altar of Precepts () is used for Buddhist believers to ordain the precepts. The caisson () above the altar which applies the Ruyi brackets has complex and sophisticated structure. Among the brackets of the pillars around the altar, 24 statues of Flying Apsaras with five-color streamers are erected. They are holding musical instruments like pipa, two- stringed fiddle, castanet etc. and dancing elegantly and vividly. A wood carving sitting Ming dynasty statue of Rocana is placed on the altar. The lotus throne he sits has a thousand lotus petals, each of which is engraved with a statue of Buddha.

Several other individuals were wounded. The self-named \\"Arm of the Arab Revolution\\" group was led by Carlos the Jackal. The siege resulted in complex diplomatic negotiations. It ended two days later, after flights to Algiers and Tripoli, with all the hostages and terrorists walking away from the situation. The fact that this was one of the first times that Arab states were targeted by terrorists also led to them being more cooperative in developing antiterrorism efforts at the United Nations.  Siege  The path taken by the attackers inside OPEC Headquarters On December 21, 1975, Saudi Arabian Minister of Petroleum Ahmed Zaki Yamani and the other oil ministers of the members of OPEC were taken hostage in Vienna, Austria, where the ministers were attending a meeting at the OPEC headquarters at Dr-Karl-Lueger-Ring 10 (renamed Universit√§tsring in 2012). The hostage attack was orchestrated by a six-person team led by Venezuelan terrorist Carlos the Jackal (which included two West Germans Gabriele Kr√∂cher-Tiedemann, Hans-Joachim Klein and Lebanese Anis al-Naqqash). The self-named \\"Arm of the Arab Revolution\\" group called for the liberation of Palestine. Carlos planned to take over the conference by force and kidnap all eleven oil ministers in attendance and hold them for ransom, with the exception of Ahmed Zaki Yamani and Iran's oil minister Jamshid Amuzegar, who were to be executed. Carlos led his team past two Austrian police officers in the building's lobby and up to the first floor, where a police officer, an Iraqi plainclothes security guard and a young Libyan economist, Yusuf al-Azmarly, were shot dead. As Carlos entered the conference room and fired shots into the ceiling, the delegates ducked under the table. The terrorists searched for Ahmed Zaki Yamani and then divided the sixty-three hostages into groups. Delegates of friendly countries were moved toward the door, 'neutrals' were placed in the centre of the room and the 'enemies' were placed along the back wall, next to a stack of explosives. This last group included those from Saudi Arabia, Iran, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Carlos demanded that a bus be provided to take his group and the hostages to the airport, where a DC-9 airplane and crew would be waiting. In the meantime, Carlos briefed Yamani on his plan to eventually fly to Aden, South Yemen where Yamani and Amuzegar would be killed. During the attack Hans- Joachim Klein was shot and injured; however, Carlos refused to leave him behind and demanded medical assistance. Kurdish-born doctor Wiriya Rawenduzy, who was living and working in Vienna, volunteered to accompany the terrorists on board in exchange for the hostages' safe release upon arrival. Carlos demanded that the Austrian authorities read a communiqu√© about the Palestinian cause on Austrian radio and television networks every two hours. To avoid the threatened execution of a hostage every 15 minutes, the Austrian government agreed and the communiqu√© was broadcast as requested. The communiqu√© written in French demanded the Arab world wage a \\"total liberation war\\". Vienna Police said that 96 hostages were taken during the siege. The attackers freed about 50 Vienna resident hostages and a bus was provided the following morning at 6:40 as requested and 42 hostages were boarded and taken to the Vienna International Airport.  Flight  An Austrian Airlines DC-9 was provided for the group and was airborne just after 9:00, with explosives placed under Yamani's seat. The plane first stopped in Algiers, where Carlos left the plane to meet with the Algerian Foreign minister Abdelaziz Bouteflika . Five oil- ministers and 31 other hostages were released, five oil ministers were kept. The refueled plane left for Tripoli, where there was trouble in acquiring another plane as had been planned. Carlos decided to instead return to Algiers and change to a Boeing 707, a plane large enough to fly to Baghdad nonstop. Ten more hostages were released before leaving. With only ten hostages remaining, the Boeing 707 left for Algiers and arrived at 3:40 a.m. After leaving the plane to meet with the Algerians, Carlos talked with his colleagues in the front cabin of the plane and then told Yamani and Amuzegar that they would be released at mid-day. Carlos was then called from the plane a second time and returned after two hours. At this second meeting it is believed that Carlos held a phone conversation with Algerian President Houari Boum√©dienne, who informed Carlos that the oil ministers' deaths would result in an attack on the plane. Yamani's biography suggests that the Algerians had used a covert listening device on the front of the aircraft to overhear the earlier conversation between the terrorists, and found that Carlos had in fact still planned to murder the two oil ministers. Boum√©dienne must also have offered Carlos asylum at this time and possibly financial compensation for failing to complete his assignment. On returning to the plane Carlos stood before Yamani and Amuzegar and expressed his regret at not being able to murder them. He then told the hostages that he and his comrades would leave the plane, after which they would all be free. After waiting for the terrorists to leave, Yamani and the other nine hostages followed and were taken to the airport by Algerian Foreign Minister Abdelaziz Bouteflika. The terrorists were present in the next lounge and Khalid, the Palestinian, asked to speak to Yamani. As his hand reached for his coat, Khalid was surrounded by guards and a gun was found concealed in a holster. All the hostages and terrorists walked away from the situation, two days after it began.  Aftermath  In the years following the OPEC raid, Carlos's accomplices revealed that the operation was commanded by Wadie Haddad, a founder of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. They also claimed that the idea and funding came from an Arab president, widely thought to be Libya's Muammar al-Gaddafi. Fellow militants Bassam Abu Sharif and Klein claimed that Carlos received and kept a ransom between US$20 million and US$50 million from \\"an Arab president\\". Carlos claimed that Saudi Arabia paid ransom on behalf of Iran, but that the money was \\"diverted en route and lost by the Revolution\\". He was finally captured in 1994 in Khartoum, Sudan and is serving life sentences for at least 16 other murders.  In popular culture  = Films = The 1997 film The Assignment depicts the OPEC siege early in the film. The 2010 Olivier Assayas-directed series Carlos documented the life of Ram√≠rez S√°nchez.

He made his Test match debut against India in February 2014, with scores of 29 and 0. He then toured the West Indies with New Zealand in June, playing in all three Tests and two T20s. He had a highly successful Test series, scoring three half-centuries and 288 runs in total, finishing second in the series list of top run scorers, just behind teammate Kane Williamson. In doing so he helped his side to an overseas series victory. By July 2014 he had claimed the spot of opener after a run of poor form for incumbents Hamish Rutherford and Peter Fulton. His first Test century was achieved against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi, on 11 November 2014; he scored 103. Despite his position as an opening batsman in Test matches, Latham was named as a middle-order batsman and backup wicket- keeper to Luke Ronchi for the 2015 Cricket World Cup. He also shared Test wicket-keeping duties against England with BJ Watling, keeping for New Zealand in the first Test at Lord's following an injury to Watling. When he is not a keeper he generally fields close to the wicket or in the slips. Latham was selected to tour Zimbabwe in 2015 as an opening batsman. During the second ODI of the series, he scored his maiden ODI century of 110 not out as part of an unbeaten partnership with Martin Guptill of 236 as New Zealand won the match by 10 wickets to level the series.

They play authentic metal combined with elements of traditional Macedonian music that includes folk instruments such as folk drum, kettle drum, bagpipes, clarinet and bendir. The members of the band are Vlatko Nushev ‚Äì Dalton (drums), Mars Marsovski (guitar), Mazdrak (bass guitar, vocals) and Hiko (folk drum, kettle drum). Beginnings Verka was formed in 1999 by Mazdrak (synthesizer, vocals), Mars Marsovski (bass guitar) and Vlatko Nushev ‚Äì Dalton (drums) who were at that time members of the bands Modified Gods (Mars and Dalton) and New Age Messiah (Mazdrak). During that period, the band played several gigs throughout Macedonia (in Skopje, ≈†tip, Kratovo, Delƒçevo, Probi≈°tip, Ohrid). After one of these shows, Mazdrak‚Äôs synthesizer was stolen together with its entire programming. Because he had no finances to buy a new synthesizer, he started playing the bass guitar, Mars moved to playing the guitar, a new member, Brane Antovski ‚Äì Blackie, joined them and started playing folk instruments (folk drum, kettle drum, bagpipes, clarinet, bendir) and thus the band changed their sound. Activity In 2001, Verka won the first prize from both the jury and the audience at Rock Fest music festival in Skopje. As winners, they recorded several tracks at the M2 Studio of the Macedonian Radio Television. These tracks were later released as their demo EP. That same year, as winners of the Demo Taksirat Festival, they got the privilege to play at the festival of that time ‚Äì Taksirat 1+2 in Skopje. In 2002, the band released their first album named Dzaga (Macedonian: –è–∞–≥–∞) through Lithium Records ‚Äì Skopje and it became one of the most selling albums of that year. After the release of Dzaga, they actively performed at clubs and festivals (Alarm Festival ‚Äì Macedonia, ExYu Rocks ‚Äì Bosnia and Herzegovina). One of their most significant shows during that time was playing as a support band for Soulfly in Skopje. Despite already having their debut album recorded, Verka didn‚Äôt get a real opportunity for promotion because the record company, Lithium Records, didn‚Äôt stick to the agreement. As a result, in 2003 the band took an unintended break that was used for creating new music. In 2009, Verka promoted the video for their new song called \\"Ogin\\" and returned to the music scene. In December 2010, the band released their second album on their own - the album was entitled Motorni Pesni (Macedonian: –ú–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–Ω–∏ –ø–µ—Å–Ω–∏) after the poetry book by the Macedonian poet Nikola Vaptsarov. During 2011, the band promoted the new album with several concerts around the country (in Skopje, Delƒçevo, Kumanovo, Bitola). In June 2012, Verka went on a Balkan tour and promoted its latest material by performing in Subotica, Novi Sad, Belgrade, Zagreb, Ljubljana, Kranj, Beltinci, Sarajevo and Podgorica. Since August 2012, Brane Antovski is no longer a member of the band. He was replaced by Hristijan Nikolovski - Hiko. In 2013‚Äì2014 the band went through some lineup changes: Mazdrak quit the band, and was replaced by Sime Zlatkov as vocalist and Zlatko Andonovski as bass player. The new lineup recorded the next Verka album named Werk.A, and released it in 2015 via Miner Recordings.

The band members are Jim Evens (vocals and guitar), Clif Clehouse (drums), Dustin Robles (bass), and Eli Lhymn (guitar). Although unsigned, the group has enjoyed considerable radio and soundtrack success with support from tastemakers including DJ Nic Harcourt, and directors Cameron Crowe and Gregg Araki. History Helen Stellar formed in Chicago in 2000 with an original line-up of Jim Evens, Clif Clehouse and Steve Bishop (bass). Evens and Clehouse worked together in a restaurant and Bishop and Evens had been school friends. After starting the band they moved to Madison, Wisconsin where they focused on developing their music while working part-time jobs. In 2001 they sent their first independent release, The Newton EP, to Nic Harcourt, then host of KCRW's influential radio program Morning Becomes Eclectic. Credited with launching musical acts including Dido and Coldplay in the U.S., Harcourt played songs from The Newton EP on air. After seeing them perform live and in response to their popular reception, Harcourt invited Helen Stellar to play live on his show. The band recorded their second EP Below Radar in Madison in 2002 before buying a bus to tour California. Once on the West Coast the bus broke down. Without enough money to fix the vehicle or return home, Helen Stellar settled in Los Angeles. Steve Bishop left the band and in 2004 Dustin Robles joined as the new bass player. In 2005 Helen Stellar released the EP I‚Äôm Naut What I Seem. In 2009 guitarist Eli Lhymn joined the band. An employee at Amoeba Music, Evens promoted Helen Stellar to customers. One of them was a friend of director Cameron Crowe's. Known for using unsigned and unknown artists‚Äîincluding The Smashing Pumpkins‚Äîin his soundtracks, Crowe said that finding Helen Stellar through his friend and loving the song ‚ÄúIO‚Äù from Below Radar was ‚Äúprobably the most random discovery of any piece of music we‚Äôve used.‚Äù In 2005 Crowe added ‚ÄúIO (This Time Around)‚Äù to the soundtrack for his film Elizabethtown. There Helen Stellar joined company with musicians including Nancy Wilson, Tom Petty, Elton John, Ryan Adams and My Morning Jacket. ‚ÄúIO (This Time Around)‚Äù also appears on soundtracks for the films Henry Poole is Here (2008) and Love Happens (2009). In 2006 Cameron Crowe released songs from Helen Stellar's three EPs along with several unreleased demos on a limited edition vinyl album entitled A Prayer to Myself, through his company Vinyl Films. Independent auteur Gregg Araki, known for his tasteful film soundtracks, featured Helen Stellar in his 2010 film Kaboom which won the first Queer Palm award at the Cannes Film Festival. In the film the band appear singing ‚ÄúOur Secrets‚Äù from the I‚Äôm Naut What I Seem EP and the song appears on the film's largely shoegazer soundtrack alongside music by bands including Interpol and The Jesus and Mary Chain. Helen Stellar were central to creating the tone of the film. As Araki told The Guardian: ‚ÄúI write with music playing all the time, it's integral to the atmosphere and spirit of my movies.\\" During a brief band hiatus in 2008, Jim Evens worked on a side project. Under the name Jim, Son Of James, he released an EP called The Disappearing Twin. Helen Stellar released their first full-length album If The Stars Could Speak, They Would Have Your Voice in 2010. ‚ÄúThe Disappearing Twin‚Äù from this album also appears in Araki's film Kaboom.

In a career that lasted from May 1800 to May 1802 he ran nine times and won five races. In the summer of 1800 he proved himself one of the best British colts of his generation, winning The Derby on his racecourse debut. Later that year he became the first Derby winner to win the St Leger, a feat which was not equalled until 1848. He was retired from racing after being injured on his only start as a five-year-old in 1802. Background Champion was a bay horse bred at Oxton Hall near Tadcaster in North Yorkshire by his owner Christopher Wilson, a highly respected figure in the racing world who, in his later years, was known as \\"The Father of the Turf\\". He was the second of three Derby winners sired by the unusually named Potoooooooo, a highly successful racehorse who became an important and influential sire. Champion's dam, Huncamunca was the direct female ancestor of the Derby winner Mameluke as well as Charlotte (1000 Guineas) and Maid of Orleans (Oaks Stakes). Racing career =1800: three-year-old season= Champion made his first appearance in the Derby at Epsom on 29 May. Despite his lack of previous experience he was made favourite at odds of 7/4 in a field of thirteen runners. Ridden by Bill Clift, he won \\"in a very high style\\" from Lord Egremont's unnamed colt by Precipitate out of Tag. Champion returned to Yorkshire for his three remaining races of 1800. At York on 28 August he ran against three opponents in a Sweepstakes over one and a half miles. He started 4/5 favourite but finished third of the four runners behind Sir Harry Tempest-Vane's colt Rolla, with Lignum Vitae second. At the same course two days later he met Rolla again in a race over two miles and reversed the form at odds of 7/1. His mixed form did not deter Christopher Wilson, who, while staying at York's Black Swan Hotel, made so many bets on his colt for the St Leger that he ran out of paper on which to record them. On 23 September at Doncaster Champion attempted to become the first winner of the Derby to capture the St Leger and thereby win the two most important races of the season for three-year-olds. Ridden on this occasion by Frank Buckle, he started the 2/1 favourite in a field of ten runners and won from Rolla. No other horse would complete the same double until Surplice, forty-eight years later. At the end of the season, Wilson sold Champion to Lord Darlington. Racing Silks of Christopher Wilson =1801: four- year-old season= In the spring of 1801, Champion raced for the first time at Newmarket, where he had four engagements. On 9 April he ran in a Sweepstakes and won the 200 guinea prize by beating his only opponent Triumvir, to whom he conceded seven pounds. On 20 April, Lord Darlington was able to claim forfeit when Mr Heathcote withdrew his horse Schedoni from a match against Champion. Two days later Champion carried top weight in a handicap Sweepstakes over ten furlongs \\"Across the Flat\\". He won the 300 guinea prize by beating Mr Cox's Cocoa-Tree, who was receiving twenty-seven pounds from the winner. On 4 May he received ten pounds from Mr Heatcote's horse Warter and won a 200 guinea match Across the Flat at odds of 1/4. On 23 September, Champion returned to Doncaster for the Gold Cup over four miles. He started 5/2 second favourite and finished third of the four runners behind Chance and the favourite Sir Solomon. At the end of the season, Champion was described by the Sporting Magazine as \\"a horse of uncommon speed and powers.\\" =1802: five-year-old season= Champion remained in training at five, but ran only once, in a match arranged the previous year. On 28 May he ran against Mr Fletcher's five-year- old horse Lethe over two miles at York. The fact that Lethe, who was receiving six pounds from Champion, started \\"high odds on\\" suggests that the Derby winner was not expected to win. In the event, the match was anticlimactic as Champion broke down with injury and failed to complete the course. He never raced again. Stud career Champion was sold as a prospective stallion to Colonel Lumm who took the horse to Ireland. He had limited success as a sire of racehorses but did sire two good broodmares.

An E P&L; internalizes externalities and monetizes the cost of business to nature by accounting for the ecosystem services a business depends on to operate in addition to the cost of direct and indirect negative impacts on the environment. The primary purpose of an E P&L; is to allow managers and stakeholders to see the magnitude of these impacts and where in the supply chain they occur. The E P&L; analysis provides a metric to measure and monitor the footprint of the company's operations and suppliers all the way to the initial raw materials. It is a tool to build awareness of the importance of nature to the sustainability of businesses; enhance visibility across a company's supply chain and deepen understanding to focus sustainability efforts and implement better-informed operational decisions; improve specificity for risk management regarding environmental dependencies and impacts; and support a more holistic view of a company's performance, while bringing clarity and transparency to stakeholders at all levels and identifying new opportunities to enhance the sustainability of a company's products.  Background  Conceived by Puma Chairman, Jochen Zeitz, and launched by Puma and its parent company's sustainability initiative (PPR HOME), the first-ever E P&L; was conducted on 2010 data and released in two phases. In May 2011 the valuation of Puma's 2010 Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG) and water usage was announced, followed in November 2011, by Puma's overall E P&L;, which also included valuation results for other forms of air pollution, land conversion and waste. Simultaneously, the PPR Group announced in November 2011 that a Group E P&L; would be implemented across its Luxury and Sport & Lifestyle brands by 2015.  Methodology  The E P&L; and the associated methodology were developed with the support of PricewaterhouseCoopers and Trucost. The E P&L; used existing input-output models and developed new valuation methodologies, building on a large volume of work in the fields of environmental and natural resource economics such as the United Nations study on The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity. Kering, the parent company for Puma, has released its Environmental Profit and Loss Accounting methodology in an open source mode. Novo Nordisk is another company that has released its environmental profit and loss account and methodology report. The 2017 annual report of Philips mentioned that the company had an environmental impact of Euro 7.2 billion for that year. This assessment was made through an Environmental Profit and Loss Accounting process. The company mentioned that this monetary value has not considered various practices that has environmental impacts.https://www.philips.com/c-dam/corporate/about- philips/sustainability/downloads/ecovision-methodologies/EPL-Account- methodology-2017.pdf  Engagement  The UK government used the Puma E P&L; as a case study for sustainable business in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Natural Environment White Paper in June 2011. In July 2011, Pavan Sukhdev who was the Study Leader of TEEB and the Special Advisor and Head of UNEP's Green Economy Initiative, referred to the Puma E P&L; in his TED presentation. Sustainability authority, John Elkington includes the Puma E P&L; in his \\"The Future Quotient: 50 Stars in Seriously Long-Term Innovation\\". In the October issue of The Harvard Business Review the Puma E P&L; is included in \\"The Sustainable Economy\\" by Yvon Chouinard, Jib Ellison, and Rick Ridgeway. In the Winter 2012 issue, the Stanford Social Innovation Review published \\"Connecting Heart to Head\\" by Ram Nidumolu, Kevin Kramer, & Jochen Zeitz. The Puma E P&L; is included as a business case study. In December 2011, Jochen Zeitz spoke at His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales' Accounting For Sustainability Forum about the Puma E P &L.; Puma's EP&L; accounting process has influenced other companies attempting natural capital accounting https://naturalcapitalcoalition.org/connecting-finance-and-natural- capital-case-study-for-eftec-natural-capital-statements/. A smartphone app has been made available, free of cost, to help students of design and fashion, to understand the environmental impactshttps://naturalcapitalcoalition.org/kering-and-parsons-school-of- design-develop-free-epl-app-for-fashion-students/.  Critique  An assessment report indicated that preparing an EP&L; report can be expensive, while benefits being derived from the process is substantial. EP&L; Accounting has also been considered as a first step in the process of ensuring that prices reflect the use of environmental goods and services.

It tells the story of two ill-fated middle-aged characters who both face a terminal cancer diagnosis and have months left to live. A chance meeting brings them together and they fall in love, both unaware of the other's shared fate. Notably, Jill Clayburgh developed the same type of cancer her character had in this film, succumbing to it in 2010. Peter Falk died just over six months later in 2011 from complications relating to Alzheimer's disease. Griffin and Phoenix was first distributed on VHS by 20th Century Fox in 1982, but has never been formally released on DVD or Blu-ray. The film was remade in 2006 under the title Griffin & Phoenix, starring Dermot Mulroney and Amanda Peet. Plot Geoffrey Griffin is in the midst of a camping trip with his estranged wife Jean Griffin, and their children Randy and Bob, at Yosemite National Park. His children and especially his wife are bored with the trip and uninterested in any family togetherness, despite his insistence. As the family is traveling back home, Griffin is driving the car while his wife and kids are being hauled in the camper behind him. He has a flashback to a doctor's visit where he is told that he has an inoperable form of terminal melanoma and will soon die, which is assumed to have been the motivating factor behind his initiative to take the trip, which his family had talked about doing before he and his wife separated. After becoming increasingly frustrated at his family's apathy about the trip, their reviling attitude toward him, and their trivial demands such as that he stop to walk the dog, he detaches his car from the camper and drives away, deserting them. Sarah Phoenix is receiving news from her doctor that she has a terminal disease, leukemia. She is in denial regarding the diagnosis, and following an angry outburst she consults another doctor who delivers the same information. Geoffrey drives to Los Angeles, where he meets with his brother, George, who updates him on his ex-wife and children and gives him $1,500 to spend at his leisure. Faced with his grim diagnosis, Geoffrey expresses his interest in a course entitled \\"Psychological Processes of Death and Dying\\", which he attends. Sarah also attends the class, and it is where the two characters first meet. After class, Geoffrey asks Sarah to meet him the following Wednesday night for dinner if she was interested. She is guarded and shows a lack of interest in developing a close relationship with Griffin due to her terminal illness, and instead of showing up for the date she spies on Griffin from the neighboring restaurant, where he spots her and invites her over. Griffin and Phoenix spend the next several weeks together falling in love and living their lives to the fullest, engaging in fun but outrageous and childish public behavior and constantly switching between an on-again and off-again relationship. Among their activities include sneaking into a movie theater, freighthopping, riding amusement park roller coasters and evading police after being caught painting messages on a water tower, where Phoenix writes \\"Class of '59\\" and Griffin secretly writes \\"Griffin Loves Phoenix\\" encased in a heart and arrow design. Neither knows that the other is also terminally ill until Sarah discovers books related to cancer, death and dying in Geoffrey's apartment, and bursts out at him in rage under the mistaken assumption that he had been stalking her and knew she was terminally ill. She tries to run away, and when Geoffrey catches her and questions her they both learn of each other's shared impending deaths. Sarah tells Geoffrey that when she becomes too ill to continue living a normal life, she will resign herself to a hospital and she does not want him to come and find her. That day finally comes; Geoffrey finds a note from Sarah telling him that her pain was too unbearable, and that he should go spend time with his family and remember his promise not to try to find her. Distraught, Geoffrey seeks her out and finally finds her after searching at over a dozen hospitals, where he sits by her bedside and they comfort each other. Unable to handle the emotional distress of Geoffrey presence, Sarah asks him to leave, which he does, presumably never to return before her death. We then see Geoffrey browsing a cemetery, where he finds Sarah's gravestone that under her name and dates of birth and death reads: \\"P.S. ‚Äì Hi Griffin Thought you'd probably drop by\\". He then proceeds to leave the cemetery and smash his own and several other cars in anger over her death. The film ends as we see a maintenance man painting over Sarah's and then Geoffrey's water tower messages.

The Lada class is the fourth generation of diesel- electric submarines designed and constructed in the former Soviet Union and Russia to replace the . Construction of the boat started in December 1997, and she was launched in October 2004. After undergoing a series of sea trials, Sankt Peterburg was commissioned in May 2010. However, the Russian Navy decided not to accept the St. Petersburg class after it was discovered that the boat's propulsion and sonar systems were inadequate. After design corrections the submarine was accepted. In 2014, Sankt Peterburg joined the Northern Fleet. Background and construction Sankt Peterburg is first boat of Rubin Design Bureau's Lada class, of which a total of eight were expected to be procured by the Russian Navy. A less capable version, the , is marketed for export. Designed during the 1990s, the St. Petersburg class is intended to be the successor to the larger Kilo class. The Kilo class is considered to be one of the quietest diesel classes in operations, giving rise to the nickname \\"Black Hole\\". Among the expected capabilities improvements of the St. Petersburg class over its predecessor were the incorporation of improved anechoic coating (to minimize sonar contact), extended cruise range, and the upgrade to newer weapons for anti-submarine and anti-ship operations. St. Petersburg-class boats can also conduct reconnaissance and defend naval facilities and sea lanes. Amid a severe shortage of funds experienced during the 1990s following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the keel of Sankt Peterburg was laid down on 26 December 1997, in Saint Petersburg by Admiralty Shipyard. The company specialises in submarine construction, having built more than 300 boats, including the and nuclear-powered submarines. By 2006, two more of Sankt Peterburgs sister boats, Kronshtadt and Sevastopol had had their keels laid down. Sankt Peterburg was launched on 28 October 2004, to coincide with the 300th anniversary of Sankt Peterburg's founding, before undergoing several sea trials, to validate her systems, until 2009. As of 25 February 2008, Sankt Peterburg was part of the 13th Brigade of Ships Under Repair and Construction (military unit number 22875), Leningrad Naval Base.–ñ—É—Ä–Ω–∞–ª ¬´–í–ª–∞—Å—Ç—å¬ª ‚Ññ 7(760) –æ—Ç 25.02.2008. Military Unit number is via warfare.ru, http://warfare.be/?catid=321&linkid;=2225&title;=western-military-district--- osc-west. Retrieved 26 February 2012. Operational history On 6 May 2010, Sankt Peterburg was commissioned into the Russian Navy, signalling the official start of her operational service. The boat thereafter underwent combat training with the Baltic Fleet and participated in a naval parade and an exercise. At the same time, she continued sea trials until late 2011. Despite having been commissioned, in November 2011 the Russian Navy decided that the St. Petersburg class would not be accepted into service, as Sankt Peterburg had fallen far short of requirements during trials. According to Izvestia, the main drawback was the propulsion unit's inability to produce half of the expected power, along with the inefficiency of the sonar system. With the construction of the other two St. Petersburg-class submarines being halted, the Russian Navy ordered additional Improved Kilo-class submarines. The decision to reject the St. Petersburg class was confirmed in February 2012 by Russian Navy Commander-in-Chief Admiral Vladimir Vysotsky, who stated, \\"The Russian Navy does not need the St. Petersburg in its current form.\\" Sankt Peterburg would remain an experimental prototype. Saint Petersburg successfully carried a missile launch in accordance with the combat training schedule in the Barents Sea. The cruise missile was launched from an underwater position at a naval target on 17 November 2016. Tests were successfully finished in December 2018. Nevertheless, as of 2020, the submarine continued to be used as a test platform for the class and according to one report, was noted not to be fully operational.https://www.shephardmedia.com/news/naval-warfare/russia-splashes- cash-corvettes-and-frigates/In April of 2020, the boat was reported undergoing new trials in the Baltic to prepare for her return to the Northern Fleet where her role in protecting the SSBN force was described as \\"vital\\".https://www.navyrecognition.com/index.php/focus-analysis/naval- technology/8309-analysis-st-petersburg-submarine-expects-upgrade-for-new-arms- trials-take-1.html Another report in 2020 suggested that her deployment could in future be shifted to the Baltic Fleet. https://www.navyrecognition.com/index.php/focus-analysis/naval- technology/8994-analysis-latest-russian-navy-contracts-offer-development- conclusions.html References External links *Project 677 Lada class Project 1650 Amur class Diesel-Electric Torpedo Submarine of GlobalSecurity.org *Navy Commander Denied Lada Subs Rejection Category:Lada- class submarines Category:2004 ships Category:Ships built at Admiralty Shipyard Category:Active submarines of Russia Category:Ships of the Russian Navy ","title":"Russian submarine Sankt Peterburg (B-585)"},{"id":"34561195","text":"Groznensky Rabochy was a Russian weekly newspaper based in Grozny, Chechnya from 1917 to 1992, and from 1994 to 2001. Post-Soviet Era During the Soviet Era, Groznensky Rabochy was then controlled by the Communist Party. After the 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union, Grozny native Musa Muradov became the paper's editor-in-chief. However, Dzhokar Dudayev, president of Chechnya's new, unrecognized secessionist government, soon attempted to make the paper an official publication of his party, and Muradov and most of his staff quit. Muradov briefly fled the violence of the First Chechen War with his family, but unable to find work in Moscow, returned to restart the paper in 1995. Refounding Groznensky Rabochy resumed publishing as an independent newspaper in May 1995, again with Muradov as its editor-in-chief. The work was dangerous, as the staff was reporting and publishing in the combat zone of Grozny. On 1 August 1996, Ivan Gogun, one of the paper's reporters, was killed in a crossfire in the Third Battle of Grozny. Muradov himself was trapped in a basement by an artillery shell, remaining there for fourteen days. The paper continued reporting through the Second Chechen War. Long-time Groznensky Rabochy correspondent Supian Ependiyev was killed covering the aftermath of a rocket attack on a Grozny bazaar on 27 October 1999; while he was conducting his interviews, a second round of rockets struck the bazaar, leaving him with fatal shrapnel injuries. At around this time, the paper was struggling financially, and its building was destroyed in Russian bombing. The staff relocated to Nazran in nearby Ingushetia, a federal subject of Russia that borders Chechnya. They nonetheless continued reporting on the conflict, shipping the paper back to Grozny on a weekly basis. They also took turns serving week-long shifts reporting from Grozny. According to Muradov, the Russian military had placed a number of restrictions on foreign journalists, limiting their access strictly to military bases and escorted routs, but as local Chechens, Muradov and his staff could evade these requirements and speak directly to Grozny's civilians. By 2001, however, both sides of the conflict had grown angry with Groznensky Rabochy's attempted neutrality, perceiving it as an implied endorsement of the opposing side. The Nazran offices of Groznensky Rabochy were searched by Russia's Federal Security Service and Ministry of Internal Affairs, while Wahhabi Chechen extremists declared a sentence of death for the paper's staff under Sharia law and began a series of threatening phone calls to the office. Muradov again moved with his family to Moscow to avoid the threats, and the remainder of the Groznensky Rabochy staff spread out across Russia. With the staff disbanded, the paper soon went bankrupt. Recognition In 2003, Muradov was awarded the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists, \\"an annual recognition of courageous journalism\\". The award citation praised Groznensky Rabochy as a \\"rare voice of reason\\" in the violence and distorted coverage of Chechnya, as well as Muradov's \\"refusal\\" to \\"become a mouthpiece for either side\\".

A leading representative of the D√ºrer Renaissance, he specialised in watercolor and gouache nature studies, many of them copied from or based on D√ºrer's work. Biography By 1576 he was living in Nuremberg, where he was mentioned in the records of the town-council meetings as the painter Hans Hoffmann, citizen of the town. He quickly became known for his copies after works by Albrecht D√ºrer. In 1584 he went to Munich to work on behalf of William V, Duke of Bavaria. In 1585 he was appointed as a court painter by Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor, who brought him to the imperial court in Prague. At the imperial court, Hoffmann advised Rudolph on the development of his art collection and acquired for him works by D√ºrer. The art collection assembled by the Nuremberg citizen contained more than 100 works by Hans Hoffmann. Because the collection was intact until the beginning of the 19th century, many of these works are documented.

The best approximation can be defined as that which minimises the difference between the original function and the approximation; for a least- squares approach the quality of the approximation is measured in terms of the squared differences between the two. Functional analysis A generalization to approximation of a data set is the approximation of a function by a sum of other functions, usually an orthogonal set: :f(x) \\\\approx f_n (x) = a_1 \\\\phi _1 (x) + a_2 \\\\phi _2(x) + \\\\cdots + a_n \\\\phi _n (x), \\\\ with the set of functions {\\\\ \\\\phi _j (x) } an orthonormal set over the interval of interest, : see also Fej√©r's theorem. The coefficients {\\\\ a_j } are selected to make the magnitude of the difference 2 as small as possible. For example, the magnitude, or norm, of a function over the can be defined by: : \\\\g\\\\ = \\\\left(\\\\int_a^b g^*(x)g(x) \\\\, dx \\\\right)^{1/2} where the ‚Äò*‚Äô denotes complex conjugate in the case of complex functions. The extension of Pythagoras' theorem in this manner leads to function spaces and the notion of Lebesgue measure, an idea of ‚Äúspace‚Äù more general than the original basis of Euclidean geometry. The satisfy orthonormality relations: : \\\\int_a^b \\\\phi _i^* (x)\\\\phi _j (x) \\\\, dx =\\\\delta_{ij}, where Œ¥ij is the Kronecker delta. Substituting function into these equations then leads to the n-dimensional Pythagorean theorem: :\\\\f_n\\\\^2 = a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \\\\cdots + a_n^2. \\\\, The coefficients {aj} making f ‚àí fn2 as small as possible are found to be: :a_j = \\\\int_a^b \\\\phi _j^* (x)f (x) \\\\, dx. The generalization of the n-dimensional Pythagorean theorem to infinite-dimensional real inner product spaces is known as Parseval's identity or Parseval's equation. Particular examples of such a representation of a function are the Fourier series and the generalized Fourier series. Further discussion =Using linear algebra= It follows that one can find a \\"best\\" approximation of another function by minimizing the area between two functions, a continuous function f on [a,b] and a function g\\\\in W where W is a subspace of C[a,b]: :\\\\text{Area} = \\\\int_a^b \\\\left\\\\vert f(x) - g(x)\\\\right\\\\vert \\\\, dx, all within the subspace W. Due to the frequent difficulty of evaluating integrands involving absolute value, one can instead define :\\\\int_a^b [ f(x) - g(x) ] ^2\\\\, dx as an adequate criterion for obtaining the least squares approximation, function g, of f with respect to the inner product space W. As such, \\\\lVert f-g \\\\rVert ^2 or, equivalently, \\\\lVert f-g \\\\rVert, can thus be written in vector form: :\\\\int_a^b [ f(x)-g(x) ]^2\\\\, dx = \\\\left\\\\langle f-g , f-g\\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\lVert f-g\\\\rVert^2. In other words, the least squares approximation of f is the function g\\\\in \\\\text{ subspace } W closest to f in terms of the inner product \\\\left \\\\langle f,g \\\\right \\\\rangle. Furthermore, this can be applied with a theorem: :Let f be continuous on [ a,b ], and let W be a finite-dimensional subspace of C[a,b]. The least squares approximating function of f with respect to W is given by ::g = \\\\left \\\\langle f,\\\\vec w_1 \\\\right \\\\rangle \\\\vec w_1 + \\\\left \\\\langle f,\\\\vec w_2 \\\\right \\\\rangle \\\\vec w_2 + \\\\cdots + \\\\left \\\\langle f,\\\\vec w_n \\\\right \\\\rangle \\\\vec w_n, :where B = \\\\\\\\{\\\\vec w_1 , \\\\vec w_2 , \\\\dots , \\\\vec w_n \\\\\\\\} is an orthonormal basis for W.

Ljan () is a residential neighborhood in the borough Nordstrand in Oslo, Norway. It is located in the eastern rolling hillsides of the fjord Bunnefjorden. To the south Ljanselva which begins at Lutvann has its mouth, and where it runs through Liadalen at Ljan it also constitutes the border with borough S√∏ndre Nordstrand. The number of inhabitants was about 3,500 in 2004. Ljan Church is known as one of the very few churches in Norway that was built in the 1930s in the Romanesque Revival style. The public beaches at Ljan are Hvervenbukta, Ljansbadet and Katten, and in addition there are a number of private bath houses along Mosseveien. The borders to the north and east are less obvious and drawn between the school circuits Ljan and Nordstrand. The name originates with an Old Norse river name ' but the meaning has been lost to time. The old Ljan farms Originally Ljan was an old farm first written about in 1308. After 1650 it was partitioned in three, (), () and Stubljan, however, the two former were purchased by the owners of Stubljan and with the addition of the farm () in Oppeg√•rd, they constituted the Ljan Estate (). Stubljan received its name from its first owner, Christopher Nilsson Stub. Peder Holter bought the farm in 1765 and had built the large main building at Hvervenbukta. Holter's widow, Madam Maren Juel and her second and third husbands, Ole Christopher Wessel and First Minister Marcus Gj√∏e Rosenkrantz then took over. Maren Juel and Rosenkrantz sold off the estate to Juel's niece, Gjertrud Maren Juel and her husband, Lars Ingier. The main building was destroyed in a fire in 1913, and today only the foundations remain. Next to Ljansbrukveien the two old porter's lodges today contain handicraft stores run by local craftspeople, and the gazebo at Hvervenbukta beach harbors a cafe which is open during the summer. Geology Ljan is located immediately south of the Oslo Graben with the ground being predominantly bedrock dating all the way back to the Precambrian, i.e. 1 billion years old: mostly nutrient-poor gneiss with more nutrient-rich amphibolite interspersed in layers. Due to the erosion that took place for hundreds of millions of years, today's rock surface was deep inside the mountains that were originally formed. During the Permian (around 250 million years ago) comprehensive volcanism marked the entire Oslo Graben and caused faults to arise across the Oslo region. As Bundefjorden sank, the Oslo valley sank along a northern fault line along the steep Ekeberg slope which remained elevated. The main western fault line follows Bundefjorden from , past Nordstrand and Ingierstrand and on to Moss. Two branches of this fault line also emerged as crack zones: one along Gjersj√∏en and Gjersj√∏elva, the other along Ljanselva. The Ljanselva crack can be followed further inland with one branch going to Klemetsrud, the second to N√∏klevann and Lutvann.Henriksen 1990, pp. 13‚Äì15 The bedrock surface cracked up further still, also outside the main fault lines, exacerbated by erosion by water and ice. Looser accretions that had settled on top of the bedrock during the Cambrium, Ordovician and Silurian Periods eroded off during the following 200 million years, causing much of the bedrock to resurface. The final \\"molding\\" of the landscape of Ljan took place during the Quaternary Period‚Äîthe recent 1¬Ω million years‚Äîwhen the land was frozen under glaciers at least five times. Each time, when the ice melted, water seared into the thin fissures‚Äîweakness zones‚Äîthat had originated in the three previous geological periods. At Ljan and neighboring Hauketo flat rock layers go horizontally, and this gave rise to the steep slope of the Ljanselva valley, Liadalen, as ice and water sheared straight down into the packed rock layers. At the end of the last glacial period, about 10,000 years ago, the Ljan fissure and other dents in the terrain were filled with moraine debris. As the weight of the glacier lifted the land heaved. In fact, the land around the inner Oslofjord rose 200‚Äì220 meters. But before that had taken place, a fjord went up at Ljan to Hauketo, with a narrow inlet into the Lusetjern Valley at Holmlia. As rivers moved the sediment back into the sea, clay soil heaped up at the Ljan fields (today Hundejordet and Hallagerjordet) because the mountain blocked the further movement, creating deep dents in the terrain where the soil accumulated. Here arable land remained up to the 45 meter contour line. Here, at Store Ljan, the first Ljan farm was cleared, followed by another, Stubljan, at Hvervenbukta. Overall, the soil cover in the Ljan area is thin as almost all soils were washed away from the steep hills and hillsides. In many places naked rock protrudes. In valley hollows though, such as at Ljan Station, at Skredderjordet and √Ösdalsveien, nutrient-rich soil with clay minerals appear. The clay soil can be quite stiff and heavy, but it is also mixed with a considerable amount of sand particles.

These properties were identified and placed on the Register in 1983, with the exception of one property that was placed on the Register in 1993. History Iron County, originally part of Marquette County, was first surveyed in 1851. At that time, the area was populated almost exclusively by Native Americans from the Menominee and Ojibwe tribes. Although the original 1851 survey of the county noted the presence of iron ore, European settlers began arriving in numbers in 1875, prospecting for iron ore. In 1880, two important ore strikes were made: the first was by John Armstrong, who opened the Crystal Falls Mine along the Paint River, and the second was by Donald C. MacKinnon, who opened the Iron River (or Riverton) Mine along the Iron River. These two mines were the foundation of the two main population centers of the county, and the success of the mines brought more prospectors to the area, with 70 mines eventually producing ore in the county. Logging also began in the county in 1875, and lumber mills were soon another important contributor the area's economy. Railroads, particularly the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad, extended lines into the county to service the expanding mines. Lines to both Iron River and Crystal Falls were completed in 1882, and both settlements expanded rapidly. Separate townships for Iron River and Crystal Falls, still under the auspices of Marquette County, were created in 1882. However, there was much local sentiment for establishing a new county for the area, and in 1885 Iron County was split from Marquette County. At the time of Iron County's creation, Iron River, then the only incorporated village in the county, was designated the county seat. However, a bitter dispute over the location of county buildings immediately erupted between the geographically disparate east side, centered on Crystal Falls, and the west side, centered on Iron River. The dispute lasted until 1889, when a county-wide general election designated Crystal Falls as the county seat. By 1890, there were nearly 4500 people living in Iron County, supported primarily by the mining and timber industries. However, the Panic of 1893 caused a depression in iron prices that lead to the closing of nearly all iron mines in the county and a severe curtailing of lumbering activities. County residents turned to agriculture to support themselves. The economy of the area rebounded around the turn of the century as major mining companies, such as the M. A. Hanna Company and Pickands, Mather and Company bought up smaller mines in the area. Logging of hardwoods began in the county around the same time, and a long period of sustained growth stretched until the Great Depression. The population of the county grew substantially during this time, reaching 20,805 in 1930. A great many of the newcomers were immigrants from Ireland, Italy, Poland, Scandinavia, Scotland, and Wales. New villages were platted, primarily to house mine workers, including Alpha, Mineral Hills, Caspian, and Gaastra. Iron River, Crystal Falls, and Stambaugh were all expanded. To serve the new residents, an electric street car line was installed in 1906, and a number of public schools were built. The Great Depression ended Iron County's economic boom. Iron mining in the county was completely halted, and lumbering was substantially reduced, leaving thousands of workers unemployed. Several federal government projects were funded in the county, including the Cooks Run Trout Feeding Station (built in 1933-34), the Pentoga Park Office and Bathhouse (built in 1936), and various Civilian Conservation Corps projects crafted by workers at Camp Gibbs (built in 1934). The mining industry was temporarily revived by World War II, but mining declined steadily in the postwar years, with few mines lasting into the 1960s and the last iron mine in the county closing in 1979. Lumber, however, has remained a substantial economic enterprise in the area, employing thousands of people until the present day. County description According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (3.7%) is water. The terrain is generally hilly, with multiple moraines and small lakes, which overlay the iron ore deposits of the Menominee range. There are eight main population centers in Iron County, five on the west side of the county and three on the east. The west-side communities are Iron River, Stambaugh, Caspian, Gaastra, and Mineral Hills. These communities are all relatively closely located along the Iron River, and indeed both Stambaugh and Mineral Hills were merged into Iron River in 2000. The east side communities are Crystal Falls, the county seat; Alpha, six miles away; and Amasa, sixteen miles away. All of these save Amasa are strung out along US Highway 2, and both Stambaugh and Mineral Hills were merged into Iron River in 2000. Iron County also contains several small \\"Junctions,\\" such as Beechwood, and mining locations, such as Mansfield, that consist of a handful of residences grouped together. The remainder of the county is primarily forested wilderness, with the western third of the county forming part of the Ottawa National Forest. MRA methodology In the 1970s, a number of historic surveys and initiatives were undertaken in Iron County and the surrounding region. These included the 1972 Historic Site Inventory of Michigan's Western Upper Peninsula by Philip E. Metzger, a 1974-74 region-wide survey of historic properties by the Western Upper Peninsula Planning and Development Region, the 1977 inventory of historic Upper Peninsula engineering and industrial by Charles K. Hyde (as part of the Historic American Engineering Record), and a comprehensive list of sites compiled by the Iron County Historical and Museum Society. In 1977, the Iron County Courthouse was placed on the National Register of Historic Places, the first such designation in the county (and only one previous to this MRA). This was followed by several other structures in the county being listed in the Michigan State Register of Historic Sites. Late in 1977, a collaboration between the Iron County government and the Iron County Historical and Museum Society was begun for the purpose of nominating a Multiple Resource Area to the National Register. The previous surveys were combined as a basis for the MRA, and the sites were field surveyed in 1979/80. Historical research was performed over the next two years, and extensive revision took place in 1982/83. Crystal Falls In 1866, claims were filed on property along the Paint River where Crystal Falls now stands. However, no attempt was made to establish a permanent settlement until 1880, when Dr. D. M. Bond and Donald C. MacKinnon of Iron River opened the Paint River Mine. Nearly simultaneously, S. D. Hollister, Sr. and George Runkel of nearby Florence, Wisconsin opened the Crystal Falls Mine. A sawmill was immediately opened, and other mines opened in the area, and by 1881, enough iron ore had been discovered that the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad decided to extend their line from Florence to Crystal Falls. The line was completed in 1882, and Crystal Falls grew tremendously, going from four commercial structures in 1882, to twenty-five by 1884. Schools were established in 1882, and Crystal Falls was incorporated as a village in 1889, the same year it became the county seat. By 1890 the population was 3,231, and there were 27 saloons in the village. In 1891, the village constructed its own hydroelectric plant. The village became a city in 1899, and continued to expand, with new streetlights, sewers, and government buildings constructed in the first part of the 20th century. The growth halted with the onset of the Great Depression and shutdown of the mining industry, only briefly reviving after World War II. There are seventeen structures and districts from Crystal Falls in this MRA. They are summarized below. One additional structure in Crystal Falls, the Iron County Courthouse, was placed on the NRHP separate from this MRA and is not included in the list below. =Frank W. Cole House= 150x150px The Frank W. Cole House was an L-shaped frame house located at 121 Third Street. It was constructed circa 1899 for druggist Frank W. Cole. It had a simple, unpretentious, two-story design covered with clapboard; one gable end was covered with multi-patterned wooden shingles. In contrast, the open front porch featured unusual pierced square columns and an intricate frieze and porch railing. This house is missing and presumed demolished. =Courthouse Residential Historic District= 150x150px The Courthouse Residential Historic District is a residential neighborhood roughly bounded by Crystal Avenue, Michigan Avenue, Iron Street, and 5th Street. It includes the Iron County Courthouse and most of the finest houses in Crystal Falls, built primarily at the peak of the mining and lumbering industries for mining officials, lumbermen, and other businessmen and professionals of Crystal City. The houses include Queen Anne, Colonial Revival American Craftsman/bungalow, and American Foursquare structures, as well as a Gothic revival church, three school buildings, and the Queen Anne sheriff's residence and Art Deco jail near the courthouse. =Crystal Falls Dam and Power Plant= 150x150px The Crystal Falls Dam and Power Plant is a utility located on the Paint River off Powerplant Road. The section of the Paint River where the dam is now located was once a series of falls and rapids that gave Crystal Falls its name. In 1891, the village of Crystal Falls constructed the Crystal Falls dam and power plant, effectively submerging the rapids. In 1902‚Äì1903, a new power plant was constructed. The plant was expanded in 1907, and new generators were installed in 1914 and 1924. The plant was expanded several times, including a 1931 installation of a new concrete dam installed containing the rollway and tainter gates and a 1996 resurfacing of the spillway. The Crystal Falls Power Plant is still operational, and is likely the oldest hydro-electric plant still in operation in the Upper Peninsula. It provides roughly 1/3 of the power demanded by the residents of Crystal Falls. The Crystal Falls Power Plant is a two-story structure measuring approximately thirty feet by sixty feet with a hipped roof. The power plant is constructed of yellow brick with sandstone trim and sits on a concrete foundation. The adjacent concrete dam spanning the Paint River measures approximately seventy- five feet long and fifteen feet high, and has four spillway sections. =Crystal Inn= 150x150px The Crystal Inn, also known as Crystal Manor or the Crystal View Apartments, is a residential building located at 400 Superior Avenue. The site where the Crystal Inn now stands was originally Crystal Falls' first hotel, the 1882 Lockwood Hotel. The Lockwood was destroyed by fire in 1918, and the Crystal Falls Hotel Company, backed by the American Legion purchased the property with the intention of constructing a new hotel. The present structure was completed in 1922. It was operated as a hotel until 1963, when the Lutheran Hospitals and Homes Society of America, Inc. remodeled it as a home for the aged, known as the Crystal Manor. The Crystal Manor closed in 1998, and the building remained vacant. In 2010, the building was renovated into a 25-unit apartment with commercial space, known as the Crystal View Apartments, by Crystal View Development Co. LLC. The complex opened in November 2010. The Crystal Inn is a three-story, Georgian Revival structure sheathed in bichrome brick accented with sandstone window sills and belt courses. It is built in a U-shape, with balanced massing and fenestration; the hotel has a wooden cornice, and an arcade-like first floor with Tuscan columns and a stained glass frieze near the entrance. The main floor contains a kitchen/pantry, dining room, offices, a large lounge area, and a sitting room/sun porch. There are 27 rooms on each of the second and third floors, and additional rooms in the attic that once housed employees of the Inn. =Ernest Diele House= 150x150px The Ernest Diele House is a two-story American foursquare house located at 213 Marquette Avenue. It was built for Ernest Diele, the head mason of the Corrigan-McInney Mining Company. The rectangular, two-story, hipped roof, frame structure is set in an ample, tree-shaded lot. The simple, clapboarded house with hip-roof dormers and a glassed-in front porch is typical of the plain but substantial houses which managers and skilled tradesmen working in the local mining industry lived in. =Falls Location Historic District= 150x150px The Falls Location Historic District is collection of seven log houses and associated outbuildings, located at the Paint River near downtown Crystal Falls. The settlement developed between 1880 and 1900, likely in part due to the opening of the nearby Crystal Falls Mine. All of the houses in the Falls Location are built from logs, and were originally single- or two-room structures of one or 1¬Ω stories. Several have been enlarged, and three were clapboarded at an early time. Two others have modern siding. The outbuildings are all of frame construction except for one log shed. In spite of these cosmetic changes, the Falls Location Historic District is significant as a cohesive late 19th-century settlement of log dwellings, one of only three left in Iron County. =Finnish and Swedish Mercantile Association Building= 150x150px The Finnish and Swedish Mercantile Association Building is a commercial block located at 336 Superior Avenue. It was built in 1908 for a co-operative grocery and department store collectively owned by local Finns and Swedes of the Mercantile Association. It is significant as a historical reminder of the large Scandinavian population of Crystal Falls in the early 20th century. The first floor of the building still houses a grocery store and there are offices on the second floor. The Finnish and Swedish Mercantile Association Building is built of brick with a classical galvanized iron cornice and a simpler galvanized iron storefront cornice over the first floor. The first-floor facade has been reconstructed. =H. W. Harte Block ‚Äì Crystal Falls Village Hall= 150x150px The Henry W. Harte Block, also known as the Crystal Falls Village Hall, was a two-story frame commercial building located at 414-418 Superior Avenue. The building was constructed around 1890 for Henry W. Harte, a prominent Crystal Falls lumberman. It was moved in 1895, at which time the Crystal Falls village offices took up residence in the building. The village offices remained in the building until 1913, when Joseph Bendick bought the building from the city and moved it across the street. Bendick modernized the facade of the building at the same time; the building remained in the Bendick family until at least the early 1980s. The Harte Block was a two-story frame commercial structure with a gable roof and clapboard siding. The facade was symmetrical with a corniced false front concealing the gable end. The first-floor storefront had a recessed entrance, above which were a series of small-paned transom windows running the length of the facade and a bracketed cornice. This building is missing and presumed demolished. =John Hasselstrom House= 150x150px The John Hasselstrom House is a -story frame house located at 400 Crystal Avenue. It was built by John Hasselstrom, a local carpenter and woodcutter, for his own use in 1898. It also served as the home and office of Dr. Harry Larson in the 1930s, and was re-roofed and remodeled in the 1960s. It is an unusual vernacular interpretation of the Queen Anne style, having a prominent octagonal turret with a steep roof, and three shingled dormers, along with a large open wraparound porch. =Frank C. Huse House= 150x150px The Frank C. Huse House is a -story late Victorian house located at 408 Fifth Street. It was presumably constructed for Frank C.

The house has a small bay window and front porch with turned posts. =Timothy Murphy House (Harbour House)= 150x150px The Timothy Murphy House, also known as the Harbour House, is a concrete block house located at 17 North Fourth Street. The house was built in about 1900 by Fred Floodstrand, a local master mason and bricklayer, for Michael Moriarty, Iron County Prosecuting Attorney. John and Ellen Harbour, for whom the house is now named, soon moved in. Their daughter Maude (or Minnie) later married Timothy Murphy, the Stambaugh railroad depot superintendent, and the couple moved into the house and raised their three children there. A number of other families lived in the home, and in 1982 it was purchased for the Crystal Falls Museum Society for $10,000. The house was extensively restored, currently serves as a hands-on museum for the society. The house is a massive two-story hipped roof Queen Anne/Colonial Revival structure built from rough-faced cement blocks. The house is symmetrical, with matching corner turrets having bellcast roofs on each side. A two-story gable- roofed bay projects from the center, and a two-story, wooden, wraparound porch that contrasts nicely with the mass of the house and gives the house the look of a steamboat. =John H. Parks Company ‚Äì Wills Hardware Building= 150x150px John H. Parks The John H. Parks Company ‚Äì Wills Hardware Building is a commercial building located at 319 Superior Avenue. The building was constructed in approximately 1890 for the John H. Parks Company Department Store. John H. and his uncle, George S. Parks, opened the department store in 1884 to complement their lumber business. John H. Parks served as president of the village board and was the first mayor of Crystal Falls. Parks later turned his business into a hardware store. In 1915, Tom Wills purchased the building for his hardware store. The building is a two-story frame Late Victorian commercial block, clad with clapboard with a pair of bay windows on the second floor. A heavy cornice runs along the top of the building and second, smaller cornice runs above the first-floor storefront.

The forty-acre farm is still owned by the Soderman family. The farmhouse is a two-story gabled structure with clapboard siding and a two- story bay window. A small garage stands behind the house. Iron River In 1880, R. L. Selden and his son William H. Selden began exploration for iron ore along the Maple River. They found enough ore that, at the end of the year, they opened the Iron River Mine (later renamed the Riverton Mine) on the east bank of the river. William Selden quickly convinced the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad run a line from nearby Stager to the area, and at the same time the brothers Donald C. and Alexander MacKinnon platted a village on the west bank of the Maple (now the Iron) River which became the settlement of Iron River. The railroad line to Iron River was completed in 1882, and settlers quickly flooded the area. The MacKinnon brothers built a sawmill, and a number of houses and stores were built, including a hotel and grocery, and churches were organized. Iron River was incorporated as a village in 1885, by which time over 1000 people lived in the settlement. and the village continued to grow. However, the Panic of 1893 decimated the local iron industry, and no ore at all was mined on the west side of Iron County from 1889 to 1900. Logging and agriculture took over as the primary economic activities around Iron River (although there was a foray into manufacturing by the Buckeye Stave Company), and the city remains the center of agricultural development in the county. After the turn of the century, iron mining again took center stage in Iron River, with ten new mines opening in the area between 1905 and 1912. More people moved to Iron River, and the village installed sewer and electric facilities. In 1913, a street railway connected Iron River to the nearby mining towns of Mineral Hills, Stambaugh, Caspian, and Gaastra. Iron River was incorporated as a city in 1926, but like the rest of Iron County suffered from the Great Depression. After a brief uptick in mining activity during and after World War II, the city returned to its small town character. In 2000, Iron River merged with nearby Stambaugh and Mineral Hills to form a larger city. The city still contains many buildings from the boom times of 1900‚Äì1920. There are 24 structures and historic districts on this MRA within the pre-2000 boundaries of Iron River. They are summarized below. Two additional structures in Iron River, the Chicago, Milwaukee and Saint Paul Railway Iron River Depot and Central School, were placed on the NRHP separate from this MRA and is not included in the list below, although Central School was included in the original nomination form. There are fourteen more structures now within the boundaries of Iron River which are located in what were once the separate municipalities of Stambaugh and Mineral Hills; these are covered separately. =Isaac W.

The building was constructed in 1905, and in 1914 was purchased by John Scalcucci. Scalcucci operated a grocery store on the first floor and lived on the second. The grocery is significant as the site of the February 1920 incident which touched off the \\"Rum Rebellion.\\" Even after the beginning of Prohibition, the Scalcucci family continued to produce wine, using a loophole in the Volstead Act that allowed them to the ill-defined \\"non-intoxicating cider and fruit juice exclusively for home use.\\" Local police disagreed with the Scalcucci's definition, and seized several barrels of wine stored in the Scalcucci basement. However, they had no warrant and Iron County State's Attorney Martin S. McDonough refused to press charges. Central state prohibition director Major A.V. Dalrymple declared Iron County in open rebellion against prohibition and descended on Iron County in force. However, McDonough secured a warrant for Dalrymple's arrest in the case that he made any arrests without warrants of his own. Eventually a compromise was reached, and Dalrymple left with no arrests made. Scalcucci's Grocery is a two-story, frame structure with a gable roof and a false-front facade. A single-story shed-roof addition is at the rear. The store's exterior is currently covered in asphalt siding and asbestos shingles, and the storefront has been altered. However, the store's interior, including the basement and winepress which started the nationally \\"Rum Rebellion\\" controversy, remains largely intact. =Robert H. Sturgeon House= 150x150px The Robert H. Sturgeon House is a building located at 112 Cayuga Street. The house was built in approximately 1900, and is notable as the residence of Dr. Robert H. Sturgeon, the first physician in Iron River. Dr. Sturgeon worked as a physician for local mining companies, ran his own private practice, and helped found the first hospital in Iron River. Dr. Sturgeon also owned commercial real estate in Iron River and served as Iron River's assessor and treasurer. The Sturgeon house is a -story Queen Anne house with a projecting cross-gable roof and a conical turret. A large Tuscan- column wraparound porch with balustered railing runs across the front. The house contains windows with colored glass lights, intricate interior woodwork, and the original paneling and lighting fixtures. The exterior finish has been covered with asphalt siding and asbestos shingles. =William J. Tully House= The William J. Tully House is an American foursquare house located at 519 West Cayuga Street. The house was built in 1909, and served as the last residence of William J. Tully, an early resident of Iron River and eventual mine owner. Tully served as county supervisor from 1888 to 1890 and as Iron County sheriff from 1891 to 1899. After leaving his post as sheriff, Tully began prospecting for iron ore and eventually had interests in the Baker, Swanson, and Tully mines. Tully lived in this home until his death in 1923. The Tully House is a square, frame structure with broad bracketed eaves. and a partially enclosed front porch extending to form a porte cochere. Ornamental foliage is carved into the entranceway gable, and a tympanum west side windows. Fluted pilasters flank the central second-story window. =Van Ornum's Addition Historic District= The Van Ornum's Addition Historic District is a residential district located at 927, 937, 941, 947, and 953 Fourth Street. The district contains the houses on one block of Fourth, from the Iron River to Olive Street. These include four bungalows built by Edward J. Van Ornum as well as Van Ornum's own residence, a two-story hipped roof structure. Van Ornum was a prominent Iron River builder, lumberman, and developer. He built his own American foursquare residence in about 1910 when he was the owner of a successful lumberyard. Van Ornum soon became a realtor, then a developer. In 1929 he platted this addition, and in 1934 had the four bungalows constructed. =Harvey Van Wagner House= 150x150px The Harvey Van Wagner House is a frame house located at 103 North Seventh Avenue. It was constructed in approximately 1920, and is a slight modification of Design B-7513 in the 1918 house-plan book \\"Modern American Homes,\\" by C.L. Bowes. The house is clad in alternating narrow and wide rows of shingles and has a cross- gable porch resting on brick piers. The house was the home of Harvey Van Wagner, vice-president of Old Commercial Bank. =Wall-Seppanen House= 150x150px James S. Wall The Wall-Seppanen House is a stone house located at 21 North Seventh Avenue. The house was built in approximately 1920, and is of a particularly pleasing bungalow design with craftsman elements, clad with stucco and cobblestones. It was once the home of James S. Wall, manager of the Oliver Iron Mining Company and president of the Miners' State Bank. The house was purchased in 1943 by Wayne E. Seppanen, who eventually became superintendent of the Caspian Mine. =Joseph Windsor House= 150x150px The Joseph Windsor House is a brick house located at 629 West Genesee Street. It was built in approximately 1912 for Joseph Windsor, who with his brother William, ran an undertaking and furniture business. The house is clad with brick on the first floor and stucco on the second. It has a hipped roof with widely overhanging eaves and a front porch with Tuscan columns. Stambaugh In 1882, with their Iron River Mine showing promise, R. L. Selden and his son, William H. Selden, joined with Dr. Louis D. Cyr of Negaunee and Louis Stegmiller of Escanaba to plat a village next to the mine. The village was christened \\"Stambaugh\\" after John Stambaugh, president of the Tod, Stambaugh Company of Youngstown, Ohio, which had recently purchased the rights to the Iron River Mine. The Tod, Stambaugh Company built a number of frame houses for mining supervisors, and in 1890 the settlement was incorporated as a village. Growth slowed in the late 19th century due to the Panic of 1893, but picked up again after 1900; electricity was introduced in 1908 and a town hall built in 1913. Due to its proximity to Iron River, Stambaugh developed only limited commercial properties, remaining a primarily residential community. In 1923 Stambaugh was incorporated as a city. Although Stambaugh suffered during the Great Depression along with other Iron County communities, it contained a number of valuable mining properties on its tax rolls, and was able to keep financially stable. In 2000, Stambaugh and Mineral Hills were merged into the nearby Iron River. There are twelve structures and historic districts from what once was Stambaugh included in this MRA. They are summarized as follows: =George Hamilton House= 150px The George Hamilton House is a bungalow- style house located at 504 Seldon Road. It was built in 1914 as the home of George Hamilton, one-time city engineer and president of the Stambaugh village council in 1898. The house is a -story bungalow with a gable roof and walls clad with stucco and shingles. The windows have multi-light uppers and single- light lowers. The Hamilton House is one of the best preserved bungalows in Stambaugh. =M. A. Hanna Company Michigan District Superintendent's House= 150px The M. A. Hanna Company Michigan District Superintendent's House is a two-story house located at 506 Selden Road. The house was built in 1933 by M.A. Hanna to house the chief executive officer of the company's local mines. The M.A. Hanna Company was a late-comer to Iron County, buying up already existing mines in the late 1920s, including the nearby Hiawatha Number One Mine. The Superintendent's House is a two-story Colonial Revival structure with a symmetrical facade with composite columns flanking the elliptically arched, fanlight-and-sidelight entrance. =John W. Hanson House= 150px The John W. Hanson House is a -story frame bungalow located at 601 Roosevelt Avenue. It was built about 1920 for John W. Hanson. The house has clapboard siding on the first floor and alternating rows of narrow and wide wooden shingles on the second floor. It sits on a fieldstone foundation, and has a gently sloped gable roof with a prominent gable-roofed wall dormer and a front porch running half the length of the building. The house has stylized Federal details, including Palladian windows and a segmental-arch side porch. The Palladian windows in the gables make this house unique in the county. =Joseph Harris House= 150px The Joseph Harris House is a two-story Prairie-style house located at 615 Washington Avenue. The house was first owned by Joseph Harris, owner of the Harris Clothing Store in Iron River, which operated from about 1910 to about 1925. The house is the purest Prairie- style structure in the county. It has a hipped roof, attic dormers, and is laid out in the American foursquare style. However, the form is altered by the massive segmental-arch front porch which extends to one side to form a porte cochere. The house has stucco walls, several leaded glass windows, wide porch eaves, and heavy pier supports with applied triglyph capitals. =Hiawatha Mine Number One Complex= 150x150px The Hiawatha Mine Number One Complex is a collection of five buildings covering four acres, located on the west side of Selden Road and north of 19th Street. Iron ore was first mined at this site in 1893 by William Seldon and Findley Morrison. Development was intermittent until 1899, after which it was operated by the Munro Iron Mining Company and then the Hanna Iron Ore Company; the Hiawatha became one of the most productive mines in the county, operating until 1950. The Hiawatha No. 1 complex eventually engulfed several smaller mines, including the Anna Mine, North Hiawatha, West Hiawatha, Chatham Mine, Stegmiller, and part of the Wickwire Mine. During that time, the mine shaft was sunk to 2100 feet, making the Hiawatha the deepest mine in the county. The site is probably the best- preserved mine operation site in the county. The most prominent structure in the complex is the 120-foot tall steel Hiawatha Mine Number One headframe, dating from 1904. It is the oldest surviving headframe in Michigan. The headframe is a stepped configuration, about 50 feet by 30 feet at the base and 10 feet by 10 feet at the top. Corrugated metal siding covers much of the headframe. Most of the headframe load is borne by a 25-foot concrete foundation pier located inside the steel framework. Also included in the complex are four single-story buildings with gable roofs, one stone and theothers frame, built in the early 20th century. =Nels A. Holmes Farmstead= 150px 150px The Nels A. Holmes Farmstead, also known as the William Sackerson Farm, is a collection of buildings located at 2614 M-189. In 1884, Nelson Holmes, a native of Sweden who had immigrated to the United States two years previously, homesteaded the land this farmsite sits on. In 1895 Nelson and his wife Minna purchased the forty acre property for $100. Nelson Holmes died in 1932 and passed the property on to his son Herman. Herman operated a logging business, a road contracting business, and served three terms as Iron County Sheriff. When Herman Holmes died in 1941, he passed the farm on to his brother-in-law, William Sackerson. The farm has been in the Holmes and Sackerson family for over 100 years. The Nelson A. Holmes farmhouse sits on a low open hill near other farm buildings, including a wellshed, chicken coop, and summer kitchen. The farmhouse is a -story, timber-framed house with clapboard siding on a fieldstone foundation. It was constructed in 1890 around an 1884 log cabin. The flank-gable roof is covered with asphalt shingles, and a hipped roof front porch covers the front of the house. The windows are still the original double-hung, two-over-two or six-over-six panes, with dentil molding in each lintel. The summer kitchen and the chicken coop are both constructed of dovetailed logs with wooden boarding at the gable ends. The wellshed features a jerkinhead roof with exposed rafters, and is covered with narrow horizontal boards. =House at 902 Selden Road= 150px The House at 902 Selden Road is low, -story, gable-roofed, early 20th-century house. The house was constructed for the Youngstown Mines Corporation, presumably for the families of administrative or supervisory employees. It is sided with clapboard and Queen Anne circle-butt shingling on the gable. Details include a Tuscan-column porch, horizontal return cornices, and a lozenge pattern upper sash in the gable window. The house is significant because if its fine architectural quality and state of preservation. =Louis Levine House= 150px The Louis Levine House is a two-story frame house located at 502 Selden Road. It was built c. 1922‚Äì25, with one of the earliest owners being Louis Levine. The house is a distinctive Colonial structure, with a veranda with Tuscan running across the front, clapboard and shingle siding, and a cobblestone foundation. =John S. McLean House= The John S. McLean House is a two-story frame house located at 230 Fourth Street. The house was constructed by the Stambaugh Company in approximately 1882 for John McLean, a skilled blacksmith. It is one of several built around the same time by the company to house key personnel in the iron mining industry. McLean purchased the property from the Stambaugh Company in 1893, and continued to own it until 1915. The house has a gable roof and clapboard siding with a glassed-in front porch. It is notable for the Eastlake ornamentation in the front gable and above the second-story window; such ornamentation is rare in Iron County. =Lafayette McQuown House= 150px The Lafayette McQuown House is a simple frame house located at 411 Adams Street. It was built in about 1895 for Lafayette McQuown, an early resident of Stambaugh who assisted William Selden, Jr. in surveying the town site in 1882. McQuown served as village president in 1893-94 and as Secretary of the Stambaugh Township Board of Education for eighteen years. He was employed by the Oliver Mining Company as head timekeeper from 1899 to 1926. It is likely that McQuown never lived in this house, but used it as a rental property. The Lafayette McQuown House is significant as a typical example of a late 19th-century miner's residence in good condition. The two-story, house with a gable roof and clapboard siding in little altered from its original appearance. It has a Queen Anne front porch with lathe-turned supports and an enclosed entranceway. =Charles Stolberg House= The Charles Stolberg House is a two-story frame house located at 411 Third Street. It was built in 1909 for Charles Stolberg, one of the first residents of Stambaugh. Stolberg worked as a diamond driller and pumpman in local mines for 48 years. The Stolberg family lived in this house from 1909 to 1915. The house is significant as one of the most well-preserved Queen Anne structures in Stambaugh. It is a two-story, cross-gable house with clapboard siding, patterned shingling in the gables, stained glass transom windows, and a wraparound front porch with Tuscan columns. =John Swanson House= The John Swanson House is a two-story frame house located at 226 Forth Street. It was built in 1913 for John Swanson, who started the Consolidated Mercantile Store in about 1909 with his partner John Olson. The Swanson House is a two- story frame, hipped roof, American foursquare structure with a full-length front porch and attic dormer. It is sided with narrow clapboard on the first floor and wood shingles on the second. Mineral Hills In the earlier stages of iron mining in Iron County, it was thought that iron ore existed only within the river valley. However, in 1905 homesteader William James found iron ore in the hills north of Iron River. He promptly opened a mine, and in 1906 the Mineral Hills Mining Company bought the James Mine. They constructed 12 frame houses near the site. Over the next 10 years five more mines opened in the area, each constructing houses near their own locations. In 1919, all six mine locations were collectively incorporated as the village of Mineral Hills. A village hall was built in 1921, but due to the proximity of Iron River, commercial businesses never developed. In 2000, Mineral Hills and Stambaugh were merged into the nearby Iron River. There is one historic district and one standalone structure from what once was Mineral Hills included in this MRA. They are summarized as follows: =James Mine Historic District= 150px The James Mine Historic District (once known as the Osana Mine) is a collection of buildings located at the intersection of Mineral Avenue and Mower Street. The James Mine was operated by the Mineral Hills Mining Company from its opening in 1906 (as the \\"Osana Mine\\") until 1925, after which the site was acquired by the James Mining Company. The James Mine operated until 1950, by which time it had five main levels reaching to a depth of 860 feet. The structures in the district were built between 1906 and 1921 by the Mineral Hills Mining Company for its miners and mine officials. The structures include a hipped roof dry house, a hipped roof pump house, a gable roof blacksmith shop, and a gable roof engine house. The district also incorporates the surrounding residential community, including the Mineral Hills Village Hall and houses with garages and other outbuildings. The James Mine Historic District is significant as a well-preserved example of a mining company settlement. =Spies Boardinghouse= The Spies Boardinghouse is a residential building located at 700 Grant Street. It is a long, two-story rectangular structure with clapboard siding, a gable-roof, and a one-story shed at one end. The building was constructed in 1909 by James Johnson for the Cleveland Cliffs Iron Company, owners of the nearby Spies Mine. The Spies Boarding House housed unmarried miners in ten second-floor bedrooms. The first floor contained a dining room, kitchen, storage rooms, and living quarters for the manager. In the early 1930s, Cleveland Cliffs converted the Spies Boarding House into four apartments Caspian After the effects of the Panic of 1893 had subsided, exploration for iron ore resumed in the area around Iron River. Southeast of Iron River, five mines opened in the first decade of the 20th century, starting with the Baltic Mine in 1900. A small village named \\"Palatka\\" was platted in the area in 1901. These mines brought miners to the area, and starting in 1904, the mining companies constructed houses for their workers. A small commercial district sprang up to service the miners; by 1908 there were seven businesses and a post office located there. A settlement designated \\"Caspian\\" was platted near the business district the same year; in 1909 \\"New Caspian\\" was platted nearby. Eventually the small settlements merged; the resulting community was known by a variety of names, but by 1913 the entire area was designated \\"Caspian,\\" after the most productive of the surrounding mines. By 1917, nearly 2000 people lived in Caspian, and in 1918 it was incorporated as a village. Water and sewage systems were installed over the next few years, and a village hall was built in 1923. Caspian was primarily settled by Italians, as evidenced by the large presences of the order of the Duca Degi Abruzzl, a fraternal order founded In 1909. However, miners of a dozen other nationalities, including Finns and Poles, also settled in Caspian. As with other communities in Iron County, the peak of prosperity in Caspian's history were the first three decades of the 20th century. It was incorporated as a city in 1949, just after the mining boom tied to World War II, but declined once the mines were closed. It is currently a quiet community, closely linked to the nearby Iron River. There are four structures from Caspian included on this MRA. They are summarized as follows: =Caspian Community Center= 150px The Caspian Community Center is an educational facility located at 404 Brady Avenue. It was constructed in 1921 by the Presbyterian Board of National Missions in an Arts and Crafts style. It was used as educational facility for immigrant families by the Board of Missions until 1950. It was later purchased by the Caspian Athletic Association, and is still used as a community center, offering play areas and meeting rooms for local youth groups. The building is a large two-story rectangular structure covered with stucco and half-timbered at the gable ends. Some structural members are exposed, reflecting Arts and Crafts architectural influences. A 1928 addition juts from one side. It contains a library, club and meeting rooms, a kitchen, and an apartment for the director. =Caspian Mine Headframe= 150x150px 150x150px The Caspian Mine Headframe is a steel mining building located at north of Caspian Road. The Caspian Mine opened in 1903, the second of three mines opened by the Verona Mining Company. Verona later sold the mine to the Pickands-Mather Company. The original headframe was wooden; the current structure was built as a replacement in 1920. The headframe is a 106 foot high steel-framed structure clad in corrugated steel siding. It is about 25 feet by 10 feet at the base and tapers to about 10 feet by 10 feet at the top. The stanchions constructed to support steel cables leading from the hoisthouse to the headframe are located nearby. This headframe is significant as the oldest remaining headframe in Iron County. The Caspian Mine was the most productive mine in the county from its opening in 1903 until its closing in 1937. Pickands-Mather Company, the operator of the Caspian, eventually deeded the headframe, engine house, and the surrounding 5.5 acres to the Iron County Historical and Museum Society. The area now serves as the Iron County Historical Museum. =Dober Mining Company House= 150px The Dober Mining Company House is a four-family house located at 1 Nineteenth Street. The house is one of two remaining that were built around 1910 to house families of the company's miners. The house is a two-story structure, gable-roofed and sided with clapboard, and is divided into four side-by-side units. There are open single-story entrance porches in the front and enclosed porches in the rear. =Italian Society Duke of Abruzzi Hall= 150px The Italian Society Duke of Abruzzi Hall is a brick, single-story building located on the east side of McGillis Avenue between Morgan and Sawyer Streets. The Duca Degli Abruzzi Italian Society was formed on September 26, 1909, by Italian men living in Caspian. The society constructed the Duke of Abruzzi Hall in 1914 as a fraternal lodge hall. The building was remodeled in 1929, at which time the present yellow brick facade was added to the building. The Duca Degli Abruzzi Italian Society and the Duke of Abruzzi Hall serves to promote local awareness of the area's Italian heritage, and as a social gathering spot for the local community. The Italian Society Duke of Abruzzi Hall is a rectangular single-story red brick structure with a gable roof and a yellow brick false front. The entryway is through double doors in a projecting barrel-arch porch with semi-circular fanlight. The Italian Society Duke of Abruzzi Hall is a 1914 building contains a dance hall with its original tin ceiling and a wine-making and sausage-seasoning room; a bocce court is next to the building. Alpha Mining began in the area around what is now Alpha in 1882. Several mines opened in subsequent years, including the Mastodon Mine opened by Alfred Breitung. The small community of Mastodon grew alongside, but none of the mines, including the Mastodon, survived the Panic of 1893 and Mastodon withered. However, in 1910, the Pickands-Mather Company began some exploratory operations in the area, and the Nevada Land Company platted a settlement near Pickands-Mather's operations. In 1913 and 1915, two productive mines, the Judson and the Balkan, were started, and miners flocked to the area. The settlement platted by the Nevada Land Company was unusually well planned for a mining settlement, consisting of a central circle atop a low hill with streets radiating from the center. The settlement grew quickly, and in 1913 a post office was opened, which was simply designated \\"Alpha.\\" Alpha was incorporated as a village the next year. A school, water tower, and village hall were quickly erected, and businesses immediately moved into the new village. The area mines, however, closed in the early 1930s, and the village rapidly declined. Alpha is now a primarily residential community, and relies on nearby Crystal Falls for goods and services. There is one historic district and one standalone structure from Alpha included in this MRA: =Alpha Public Buildings Historic Complex= 150x150px 150x150px The Alpha Public Buildings Historic Complex is a collection of three buildings ‚Äì the village hall, the George F. Porter public school, and the water tower ‚Äì prominently located on a single block in the center of Alpha at 404 Main Street. The three buildings, and other significant public structures in Amasa, are built around a traffic circle in the center of town. All three structures on the register were built in 1914 at the peak of Alpha's growth, and are typical of the civic buildings built in the Upper Peninsula in this time period. The Porter School was last used as a school in 1967, and was sold by the village in 2005. It is now used as a small business site. The water tower has been replaced with a modern structure. The village hall is a single-story, rectangular structure with a gable roof and a three-bay front porch. It is covered with clapboard and has a leaded wheel window in the gable end. A single-story addition of similar construction houses fire-fighting equipment. The water tower consists of a clapboard-covered shaft enclosing the stand pipe. It was originally topped with a small wooden tank; the current steel tank was installed in 1931. The George F. Porter School is a two-story rectangular Classical Revival structure, constructed of brick with a hipped roof. Two entryways with sandstone porches are flanked by Tuscan columns. Above these are two hip-roofed dormers and twin octagonal cupolas. Two single- story wings were added to the school in 1920 and 1929. =First National Bank Building= 150px The First National Bank Building is a commercial building located at 303 Main Street. The structure was built in 1914, and is a single- story, square-plan, glazed brick building with an angled corner entrance. Brick pilasters flank the entrance and intersect a pressed metal cornice. Amasa Iron ore was first discovered along the Hemlock River in 1888 by Matthew Gibson and his son Thoburn. The next year, the Hemlock Mining Company, a subsidiary of the Pickands, Mather Company bought property just west of what is now Amasa. A railroad spur was constructed to the site, and full-scale mining operations began in 1890. A settlement arose near the mine; it was initially dubbed \\"Hemlock,\\" but in 1892 the name was changed to \\"Amasa,\\" for Amasa Stone Mather, the son of Pickands, Mather president Samuel Mather. Five more mines were opened in the area in the next few years, and lumbering began in the area, and as a result Amasa grew rapidly. In the early 1890s, a township hall, post office, boarding house, train depot, and several commercial structures were constructed. A fire department water system, and street lighting were all put in place just after the turn of the century. Amasa continued to grow until the 1930s, when local mines began shutting down. The last area mine closed in 1940, and Amasa has changed little since that time, supported primarily by the timber industry. There are four structures and historic districts from Amasa included in this MRA. They are summarized as follows: =Amasa Historic Business District= 150x150px The Amasa Historic Business District is located along the 100, 200, and 300 blocks of Pine Street, and contains structures primarily built between 1890 and 1920. The buildings in this district are significant as well-preserved examples of historically and architecturally important buildings in the business center of a mining and lumbering town. The district includes the township hall, a railroad depot, a church, four bars, a senior citizen's center, a lumber company office, three commercial structures, and one single-family residence. The earliest structures in the district are the Blomquist Boarding House (built in 1892), a hotel (c. 1892), and the Amasa Depot (1893). The Grace United Methodist Church (1905) is a simple Gothic frame structure with a square belfry. Most of the commercial structures are long, narrow, two-story frame buildings with gable roofs and false fronts. One exception is the Hematite Mercantile Building, a single-story brick building trimmed with sandstone. After local mines closed, growth in Amasa halted, and the historic district remains as it was in the early 20th century. {class=\\"wikitable unsortable\\" ! style=\\"background:light gray; color:black\\"More images of the Amasa File:Amasa MI Historic District A.jpgAmasa Depot File:Amasa MI Historic District B.jpgAmasa City Hall (now Historic Museum) File:Amasa MI Historic District C.jpgCommercial buildings File:Amasa MI Historic District E.jpgGrace United Methodist Church } =Joseph Bowers House= 150x150px The Joseph Bowers House is a -story frame house located at 318 Hemlock Avenue. It is sided with clapboard and has a gable roof. A wide roofed front porch features turned columns and ornamental bracketry beneath the eaves. The house was constructed in 1901, and is significant as a well-preserved example of typical miners housing constructed at the time. =Jacob Jacobson House= 150x150px The Jacob Jacobson House is a frame located at 327 Maple Avenue. The house was apparently built by carpenter Jacob Jacobson in 1902 as his own residence. It is a -story rectangular frame structure with a gable roof and clad in clapboards. A hipped roof porch with squared and turned columns runs the full length of the house, and a lean-to addition is located in the rear. The house is a particularly well preserved, typical example of residential architecture dating Amasa's developing years. =Park City Historic District= 150x150px The Park City Historic District is a settlement containing seven log houses and associated outbuildings located at Park City and DNR Roads. The houses were built by iron miners working in the nearby Michigan Mine, which operated from October 1891 to 1916. The district is one of three remaining log cabin settlements in Iron County, and is significant as one of the settlements purchased and developed by miners themselves, rather than by the mining company. The houses in the district are one- and -story gable-roofed buildings of horizontal log construction. Several buildings have tar paper or asphalt shingles, and some have frame additions or outbuildings. In addition to the seven standing homes, the district contains the ruins of two other log houses. Beechwood Beechwood was first settled in 1882 by J. Jens Larsen, and his wife, Lebbe. The railroad came through the settlement in 1887, and the community received a post office, managed by Lensen, in 1891. In 1912, the Beechwood Store was built; it eventually served as the post office until 1976. There are two historic properties located in Beechwood included in this MRA. They are summarized as follows: =Beechwood Store= 150px The Beechwood Store is a two-story, frame, gable-roofed commercial building located at 215 Beechwood Road. It was constructed in 1912 for Albert J. Sandgren and Andres J.T. Anderson, brothers-in-law and community leaders in Beechwood. It served as country store, post office, and the social center of Beechwood, a small Swedish settlement later absorbed into Iron River. The store was operated as a family enterprise by a series of owners, continuing to serve as the post office until 1976, and finally closed in 1979. The original 1912 store has a single-story 1915 addition to the rear, and a 1920 gas station/garage is located near the main building. Most of the store has been re-sided with asbestos shingles, but the storefront and the interior of the general store retain their original appearance. As of 2019, the building is missing and presumed demolished. It was removed from the NRHP in 2020 =Bethany Lutheran Church= 150px Bethany Lutheran Church is small church, dating from 1912‚Äì13, located at 184 Beechwood Road. It is significant as a completely unaltered rural church built in the early 20th century. Bethany Lutheran Church was originally organized in 1911 to serve the Swedish Lutheran population of Beechwood. Albert Sandgren, the co-owner of the nearby Beechwood Store, drew the plans for the church building. Volunteers from the congregation did most of the construction work, finishing in 1913. The church is still regularly used to hold services for the local Lutheran community. The church is a rectangular, frame, gable-roofed structure covered with clapboard and sitting on a rough-cut rock foundation. It has a hexagonal apse in the rear containing a small leaded glass window and a square belfry tower in the front. Gothic arched windows line each side and the interior contains a carved oak communion rail and altar. Other locations There are five historic districts located in rural parts of Iron County on this MRA. These are summarized as follows: =Camp Gibbs= 150x150px Camp Gibbs is a camp located at 129 West Camp Gibbs Road, in the Ottawa National Forest. Camp Gibbs is near what was once Gibbs City, a small settlement named after lumberman RF Gibbs that existed from 1914‚Äì1966. Camp Gibbs was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the latter half of 1935 on land purchased by the US from the Michigan Mineral Land Company, and is the only remaining CCC camp in Michigan. The camp was used from 1935 to 1941 as a Michigan Social Welfare Community Organization site to house workers employed in the forest. In 1967, the Iron County Sportsman Club purchased the camp. The club consolidated with other local clubs in 1974 to form the Camp Gibbs Recreation Area. Camp Gibbs contains 16 single-story wood-frame, gable-roofed buildings, plus the sites of three other buildings that have been demolished. Many buildings were originally used as barracks, but also include a kitchen, shower room, bakery, garages, and storage. Most of the existing buildings are covered with gray asphalt paper siding, but a few still have original tar paper sheathing with vertical furring strips. The structures are built on wooden posts, some of which have been replaced concrete blocks, and have wooden skirting extending to ground level. The camp represents vernacular architecture from a time when frugality was a substantial concern. =Cooks Run Trout Feeding Station= 150x150px 150x150px The Cooks Run Trout Feeding Station is a small trout hatchery, consisting of a pond, dam, and several buildings, located at 180 Cooks Run Road. The station was constructed in 1933-34 by the Civil Works Administration for the use of the Michigan Conservation Department in managing the local fish population. The station is currently operated by the Iron County Park Service. The most significant building is the caretaker's cabin, which is notable as an outstanding example of vernacular wilderness camp architecture, with finely crafted details and using local building materials. The cabin is a low, -story rustic building, built of round logs on a fieldstone foundation. It has an H-shaped floor plan with gable-roofed legs connected by an open shed-roofed porch stretching between the legs. It is built of notched logs chinked with mortar, with the gable ends of smaller logs laid in a herringbone pattern. Inside, the cabin has four rooms, with fieldstone chimneys and intricate decorative work, including hand-carved light fixtures and a lattice-work stairway built from tree roots by local wood carver Frank Ranwick. =Mansfield Mine Location Historic District= 150x150px The Mansfield Mine Location Historic District is a collection of log buildings located on Stream Road in Mansfield Township. Mining exploration was started in the area in 1882, but was unsuccessful until the founding of the Mansfield Mine in 1889 by the Mansfield Mining Company. A railroad spur was built to the location in 1890, and the area grew quickly. On September 28, 1893, a cave-in occurred, collapsing multiple levels of the mine and allowing the waters of the overhead Michigamme River to break into the mine, drowning twenty-seven of the forty- eight miners working on the site. The incident is still the single worst mining accident in Iron County's history. The mine closed after the accident and all items of value removed. In 1894, a forest fire destroyed all of the original buildings save the timber head frame. In 1896, the DeSoto Iron Company of Springfield, Illinois bought the property, diverted the river, and reopened the mine. Mining continued until 1913, when the Mansfield closed for good. The Mansfield Mine Location Historic District includes a collection of primarily residential buildings constructed between 1896 and about 1900. Most are small single-story houses of log construction with roofs. Many of these have shed additions. One mine-related building, the rough-cut stone powder house, is still extant. =Triangle Ranch Headquarters Historic District= 150px The Triangle Ranch Headquarters Historic District is a ranch complex located off US-141 north of Amasa. Triangle Ranch was started in 1920 by Judson G. Rosebush, a prominent banker from Appleton, Wisconsin, through an independent company he called the Rosebush Ranch Company. Rosebush's aim was to \\"test out exhaustively the practicability of large-scale, capitalistic manufacturing methods in agriculture\\" by raising pedigreed Herefords. Rosebush initially purchased 9,472 acres near Amasa, built five enormous barns and other buildings, and rapidly developed the ranch. However, the short growing season made laying in necessary winter fodder difficult. After 1925, the ranch sold off some parcels of land and attempted to diversify operations by fur farming, raising sheep and poultry, and operating a dude ranch, but was never profitable. In 1952 the Triangle Ranch closed for good. Triangle Ranch is significant as a rare attempt at large-scale ranching in Michigan. The historic district contains both agricultural and residential buildings. The structures on the site include a frame bungalow sheathed in cobblestones and shingles used as the manager's house, a single-story gable-roofed structure clad with shingles used as the manager's office, three frame bungalows used by ranch employees, a single-story bunkhouse, a gambrel-roof barn, three silos, a board and batten garage, a shop, and a granary. =Van Platen - Fox Lumber Camp Historic Complex= 150px The Van Platen - Fox Lumber Camp Historic Complex is a group of four frame buildings located at 281 University Road. The district is significant as perhaps the only extant logging camp in the western Upper Peninsula. The camp was constructed in 1921 by the Van Platen - Fox Lumber Company, who used it as a base for harvesting hardwoods and transporting them to the rail line 2¬Ω miles away. Van Platen - Fox used the camp until 1935. In 1937, the camp was leased by the University of Michigan as a summer training camp for forestry students, and was rechristened Camp Filbert Roth. after the founder of the university's School of Forestry. The University constructed additional classroom buildings on the site, and in 1942 purchased the camp and the surrounding 90 acres. More log cabins were constructed near the site of the original camp, but these more modern buildings do not aesthetically conflict with the original camp structures. In 1988 the university closed the camp, and the property was sold in 1996. The four frame structures from the original 1921 Van Platen - Fox Lumber Camp are similar single-story buildings with gabled roofs and vertical pine plank siding. Three of the buildings are unaltered, but the camp office/store has two small, single-story additions. As of 2019, the buildings are missing and presumed demolished.

Some contemporary versions have been greatly relaxed, and have been described as fad diets. Origin and original form The Rice Diet Program was founded in 1939 by Dr. Walter Kempner (1903-1997), a refugee from the Nazis, who was at that time associated with Duke University. Kempner had many patients with malignant hypertension with kidney failure, and there were no good treatments for those patients. He believed that the kidney had two functions, one excretory and the other metabolic, and \\"he theorized that if the protein and electrolyte load on the kidney was reduced to a minimum, the kidney might better perform its more essential metabolic role. The details of his reasoning are obscure, but he began to treat patients with malignant hypertension with a diet composed of nothing but rice and fruit, and amazingly, they rapidly improved.\\" Kempner's implementation was very strict, but also careful - patients were hospitalized for several weeks at the beginning of treatment. The initial treatment was stopping all medication and putting the patient on a diet consisting of \\"white rice, sugar, fruit, fruit juices, vitamins and iron, and provided about 2000 calories, 20 grams of protein, and 700‚Äì1000 ml of liquid as fruit juices. Sodium content was extremely low, about 150 milligrams per day, and chloride content about 200 milligrams per day.\\" If results were good, after several months small amounts of lean meat and vegetables were added to the diet. Kempner obtained remarkable results, and he was invited to present them at a meeting of the New York Academy of Medicine in 1946. His presentation survives and \\"presents clear and unambiguous evidence, including blood pressure charts, retinal photographs, chest radiographs, electrocardiograms and laboratory results, documenting the benefits of his diet.\\" Kempner described his diet as \\"a monotonous and tasteless diet which would never become popular.... Kempner's only defense of its use was the fact that ‚Äúit works,‚Äù and that the diet was preferable to the alternative of certain death\\" =Controversy= Kempner admitted in statements before his death that he whipped patients who avoided his rice diet. In 1993, a former patient Sharon Ryan sued him.\\"Report: 'Rice Diet' Doctor Beat Patients\\". Los Angeles Times. Retrieved November 30, 2018. Ryan accused Kempner of keeping her as a \\"virtual sex slave\\" for nearly two decades. According to the lawsuit, Kempner \\"persuaded Ryan to drop out of college, moved her into a home he owned, hired her to work for the clinic, and maintained a sexual relationship with Ryan by isolating her from the outside world\\". The lawsuit ended with a confidential settlement.\\"Settlement reached in suit involving rice diet dietitian \\"Settlement reached in suit involving rice diet dietitian\\". Deseret News. Retrieved November 30, 2018. In 1997, the Raleigh News & Observer reported that, by 1975, Duke University Medical Center (now Duke University Hospital), knew that Kempner had used a riding crop on several patients and reprimanded him, though he continued to be associated with the University. Contemporary forms Kempner retired from the Duke Faculty in 1974, but consulted until 1992. The commercialization of drugs to treat hypertension reduced both demand for the program and the need to make it strict in order to prevent death. In 2002 the program became independent of Duke University, and in 2013 the Rice House Healthcare Program opened in Durham, North Carolina. The Rice House Healthcare Program is an inpatient facility where people are put on a diet akin to the original diet and are monitored.Rice House Healthcare Program Official website The rice diet has influenced some contemporary advocates of the plant-based diet. For example, physician John A. McDougall has commented regarding the research of Walter Kempner that \\"all who have followed in his footsteps, including Nathan Pritikin, Dean Ornish, Neal Barnard, Caldwell Esselstyn, and myself, owe homage to this man and his work.\\"Walter Kempner, MD ‚Äì Founder of the Rice Diet.

Payton is very close to Tess and seems to be developing a crush on Nick, the tech guy for the school play, although she doesn't know it yet. She also has to deal with Sydney and Cashmere constantly putting her down and works on standing up to Sydney. Emma is friends with Quinn, and is not officially in a relationship with Ox, although it is very obvious they like each other. Emma is nemesis's with Jazmine James, another very intellectual girl. Both are very competitive with each other. As Emma's relationship with Ox continues and becomes better friends with Quinn, she gets very confused. Between tutoring the twin boys, who bring a gecko to Emma's lessons every time, creating even more stress for her, friendships and relationships, Emma feels she must decide between social life or winning competitions and beating her nemesis, Jazmine James, she decides to go back to being AcadEmma, all academics and no social life. Quinn and Ox get upset by this, Emma even breaking up with Ox and starts ignoring all Quinn's invitations to hang out with her. At the end, Ox is not allowed to date but wants to date Emma.

When she sees Tess, Nick, Reilly and all her other friends from the play practicing without her, she is heartbroken. Payton also becomes better friends with Tess and Payton begins to have a crush on Nick, who returns her feelings, although neither of them are aware of that yet.

Emma gets over her fear of geckos and searches the basement herself after realizing how important the play is to Payton, and Payton goes on stage. After the play, Payton and Emma meet Nick's family, when Emma realizes that she can succeed in competitions and do well in school and balance a social life at the same time. She becomes \\"unofficial\\" boyfriend and girlfriend with Ox, due to the fact that their parents think they are too young to date.

Shortly after, Priya was selected as one of three \\"Pop\\" genre finalists of the John Lennon Songwriting Contest and named a category winner in the Billboard Song Contest. In January 2012, Priya signed to Japanese indie P-Vine Records after her EP was discovered in a record shop in Kobe, Japan.

The character returned in a more central role for the shows 20th anniversary in 2012. Zac appeared in numerous stints throughout the show's first 20 years, initially debuting in May 1995 as a short term love interest for Grace Kwan (Lynette Forday). He was later involved in a high- profile revelation that he was the half brother of established character, James Thornton (Chris Dykzeul). Zac returned 6 years later as part of Rachel McKenna's (Angela Bloomfield) alcoholism storyline before his return in 2012 saw him take on a more antagonistic role. His storylines saw him have a heated affair despite being in a relationship and later, sexually assault Roimata Samuels (Shavaughn Ruakere) in a personal attack on her husband. Zac has been labelled a \\"hottie\\" and his generally remembered for his good looks. His later storylines saw Zac branded as one of the best Shortland Street villains of all time, being praised by reviewers and stars of the soap itself. Creation and casting Mike Edward was just 21 when he cast in the role of Zac in 1995. Part of the role in which producers intended Shortland Street to participate in, was to accurately portray and convey real life community and everyday occurrences. The character of Zac was written as a builder so as to embody the role of the working class man. Edward maintained the role until mid 1996. Edward returned to the role on 23 November 2002 in a month-long recurring stint. Edward auditioned numerous times throughout the next few years but was constantly rejected due to producer's suspecting the audience would recognize him as Zac. In 2011 the role of \\"Jack\\" was created, a love interest for Sarah Potts (Amanda Billing) who would cheat on her in a high-profile love triangle. The character and storyline was decided to unfold over 6 months in a bid for slower paced story arcs. Producers soon realized they could fill the characters spot with that of Zac and Edward was hired. In January 2012 it was announced that a previous character would be returning and \\"will get the hearts of many a Shortland Street pounding.\\" In February it was confirmed that it was Zac who was returning. The character returned on 1 February 2012. Edward was happy that producers decided to reintroduce Zac instead of bringing in a new character, stating \\"He [Zac] keeps coming back which is kind of genius.\\" Following the conclusion of the character's arc and the 6 months, producers decided to extend Edward's contract and have Zac undergo a storyline where he sexually assaulted Roimata Samuels (Shavaughn Ruakere). Edward enjoyed the challenge but acknowledged, \\"it's going to be the end because it's so irredeemable.\\" Chris Tempest (who portrayed Dr. Josh Gallagher) stood in as Zac during the sexual assault scene to leave the assailant ambiguous. Zac made his last appearance on 6 February 2013 and Edward had no quarrels with leaving the role, \\"I'm happy to move on. The last few times Zac has left the show, his parting lines have been, 'I'm just going to sit on the beach and get my head together', so at least now it's done.\\" Edward was not opposed to a return, but acknowledged it was up to the producers. Storylines Zac arrived as a builder on Lionel (John Leigh) and Kirsty's (Angela Dotchin) new house after being recommended by Julia (Elizabeth Hawthorne). Zac became the talk of the town due to his good looks and ended up leaving Ferndale after briefly dating Grace Kwan (Lynette Forday). Zac returned several months later and with the help of Julia's son James (Chris Dykzeul), managed to track down his father, Phillip, on the internet. However it soon turned out that James was the result of an affair between Julia and Phillip, thus making him Zac's half brother. When Julia's husband died, Zac slowly was welcomed into the Thornton family. In 1996 Zac dated Ana Fa'asolo (Mary Lose) but she soon realized that Zac had developed a mutual attraction to Julia. Zac was disgusted when he discovered this attraction and he fled Ferndale to rid himself of these feelings. He returned 6 years later and impressed many with his flashy apartment and his job at an upper class bar, none more so than Rachel McKenna (Angela Bloomfield). With her relationship on the rocks, a small spark between Rachel and Zac brewed potential romance but when her alcoholism lead her to nearly drown in his pool, Zac harshly dumped her and fled Ferndale. In 2012 Zac returned when he was hired by Sarah Potts (Amanda Billing) to care for her brain damaged son Daniel (Ido Drent) as he had become a nurse. The two soon started to date and Zac got employed at the hospital. Despite appearing devoted, Zac started an affair with his boss, Vasa Levi (Teuila Blakely). The affair was short lived but when the truth was revealed, Sarah broke it off and much of the hospital staff turned against Zac, primarily brought on by Sarah's ex-husband TK Samuels' (Benjamin Mitchell) input. In November the staff were shocked when TK's wife Roimata (Shavaughn Ruakere) was sexually assaulted by an unseen assailant in what seemed an attack on TK. It soon turned out Zac was the attacker and he framed Josh (Chris Tempest) after landing TK with a reckless driving charge from a poisoned drink. When Roimata discovered Zac was the culprit, much of the hospital turned against him and he ended up kidnapping her and holding her hostage for several days in 'The I.V.' cellar. Enough evidence was soon collected to prove Zac had taken her and he was arrested and charged. In June 2014, a neighborhood watch team was created in part due to the legacy of Zac and his attack on Roimata. Character development Edward debuted as Zac at the age of 21, and was regarded as a \\"hunk\\". =Characterisation= Upon his first appearance, Zac was labelled a \\"hottie\\", however during his storylines 17 years later, he was referred to as a \\"sleaze\\". His initial storyline with Julia (Elizabeth Hawthorne) saw the character debut as a \\"troublesome toyboy\\" and his \\"wild ways were far from redeemable.\\" Edward found that Zac was determined, stating; \\"Zac will fight here, bust up there.\\" He was described as handsome, easy going and \\"used to the adoring gaze of women and men alike.\\" Despite being called \\"wiser\\" and \\"more experienced\\" in his 2012 return, Edward disputed the label, saying; \\"I don't think he's a lot wiser. In many ways, he has stalled in his life. He doesn't have a lot of money. He's a bit 'kept', which will lead to tensions down the track.\\" Edward also agreed that Zac was led astray by women and often focused too heavily on them. A new side of Zac was shown in April when he openly and continuously pursued a sexual relationship with Vasa (Teuila Blakely) despite his partnership with Sarah (Amanda Billing). Upon accepting the return to the role, Edward was aware that Zac would be a \\"love-rat\\" but did not realize the extent of the villainy he was going to undergo. Edward acknowledged the antagonistic characteristics of his character, stating \\"I think there's definitely so much more darkness to Zac .... he's got a lot of aggression and anger that hasn't even been touched on yet.\\" On the character's villainous attitude, Edward stated \\"It's interesting when I play him because I do the scenes and I don't actually feel that bad doing it. Then I see it cut together and go, 'oh my gosh, that's actually a bit naughty!'\\" However he confessed he liked Zac as a character due to the fact he was: \\"very unapologetic.\\" Edward was happy to play Zac as a villain, \\"Shows need bad guys and soap operas need villains ... I'm more than happy to play the villain to tell a good story.\\" When asked to describe Zac in a sentence, Edward jokingly referred to him as, \\"a very misunderstood man\\" and despite cheating on her for months and not actually appearing if he did, Edward believed Zac genuinely loved Sarah but was just too insecure to show it. The Otago Daily Times reviewer, Charles Loughrey, described Zac as a, \\"love-rat with an increasingly obvious penchant for extreme villainy\\". Edward himself later referred to Zac as \\"evil\\". =Sexual assault of Roimata Samuels= Following the extension of Edward's contract, producers decided to undergo a sexual assault storyline utilizing the character of Zac. They wished not only to develop his character and the story, but also portray an ethical and real issue in society. Edward explained, \\"They had a six-month arc for him initially, so that basically took it to him being with Sarah and having the affair with Vasa and then Sarah finding out. Then it was around the six-month point where I got told they were going to keep me on. I asked them what was going to happen and they weren't too clear ... then about two months into it I got told.\\" Throughout 2012, the relationship between Zac and Sarah's ex-husband TK Samuels (Benjamin Mitchell) was portrayed as rocky, with the two men's contrasting feelings for Sarah playing a major part. In November a scene aired where TK's wife, Roimata (Shavaughn Ruakere) was sexually assaulted in an alleyway following her birthday party. Sexual assault storylines had previously occurred in Shortland Street (such as the rape of Minnie Crozier (Katrina Devine) in 1998), but Ruakere felt Roimata's was portrayed with \\"the most depth needed\\". Behind the scenes, Zac was always intended to be the perpetrator but the assailant was depicted anonymously so as to create suspense. To further the illusion that it was not Zac, directors shot the assault scene with Chris Tempest (Josh Gallagher) actually physically carrying it out, whilst Sam Bunkall (Boyd Rolleston) added the voice over. The trick successfully fooled much of the audience, with many believing it was in fact Beulah Koale's (Jared Afeaki) voice. Edward found not actually playing the assault made his work a lot easier, \\"I guess in a lot of ways that was good because the way I reasoned with Zac is the compartmentalize. He's got the amazing ability to put something in a box and put something else in another box and keep the two entirely separate. So having no memory of it and feeling totally innocent of the performance of it, kind of helped in lots of ways.\\" On screen Zac was interviewed by police when footprints matching his boots were identified at the scene of the crime. Though Zac denied any involvement and was even backed by ex lover, Vasa Levi (Teuila Blakely). However, on 12 December 2012, Zac was revealed to the audience as the attacker when he threatened Detective Lisa Stone (Caitlin Bossley) and later removed a balaclava to expose his face. The characters soon started to discover the attacker had assaulted Roimata as a personal attack on TK. Further harassments included the assailant breaking into the house and sprawling out Roimata's underwear and later leaving a white feather on the doorstep. During the 2012 season cliffhanger, Zac was described as a, \\"a master puppeteer\\". He was said to be playing TK, Roimata, Sarah and Josh, \\"like pawns in his own twisted game of chess, moving suspicions from one person to the other in order to keep his identity under wraps\\" and it appeared as though he were \\"unstoppable\\". As the year ended, Zac poisoned TK and used several tricks to frame Josh for the attack However, with Josh's input, Roimata realised Zac was the attacker and publicly accused him, causing him to lose what little friends he had left. With his dwindling amount of friends, in early 2013 Zac decided to take drastic action in exacting revenge on TK. He kidnapped Roimata, bound and drugged her and locked her in the cellar of 'The I.V.' bar. After Roimata was eventually recovered, Zac was arrested and charged after she collected enough DNA evidence to have him charged. Reception Zac has been immortalized, being listed as one of the numerous men the iconic Rachel McKenna (Angela Bloomfield) romanced and is generally well regarded as a \\"hunk\\" and a \\"hottie\\". Edward expressed his hope that the character would become one of the soap's best ever villains. Amy Usherwood (Emma Franklin) named Zac as the character besides her own whom she would enjoy playing, due to the fact: \\"he gets to be naughty\\". Reviewer Dionne Christian labelled Zac: \\"Shortland Street's resident love rat\\". Blogger Bridget Jones hoped that the end of the 2012 season of Shortland Street would see the end of Zac's manipulative behaviour. Zac was described by one reviewer as, \\"one of the most manipulative creeps and terrifyingly clever assailants that Shortland Street has ever seen\\". The development of the character of Zac following his attack on Roimata, was named by Rebecca Barry Hill of The New Zealand Herald as a satisfying continuation of the drama brought on by the shows 20th anniversary in May. Zac's return to the soap, his love triangle between Sarah (Amanda Billing) and Vasa (Teuila Blakely), alongside his shirtless confrontation with TK Samuels (Benjamin Mitchell) and later sexual assault of Roimata (Shavaughn Ruakere), were all named as part of the top moments of the 2012 Shortland Street season. In 2013, Zac's return was listed as the 8th best ever character return on the soap by the Shortland Street website. A reviewer from The Otago Daily Times highlighted how successful the character of Zac was and noted a surprise in the character not being like \\"99%\\" of the characters, in that he wasn't a doctor. He commented that the character obviously spent too much time at the gym and mentioned the increasing amount of soap opera storyline climaxes involving locking characters in cellars. However he also noted that the character of Zac was sure to be written off due to the content of his story lines. Although Edward received a fair amount of verbal abuse on the streets, he expected a more physical tone due to past experiences with Johnny Barker (Joey Henderson), whose character murdered 5 woman. Upon ending his stint, Edward acknowledged that Zac was liked by fans when he first arrived in 2012 but by the end, had become a character fans, \\"loved to hate\\". In the Ferndale Talk Best of 2013 awards, Zac's conclusion was voted the fans second favourite storyline and 3rd most shocking plot twist. Television New Zealand named the kidnap storyline as the second best moment of the 2013 season. In 2015 a New Zealand Herald author described Zac as one of the \\"most evil\\" characters in the soap's history.

His first book, Hunting in Northumbria, appeared in 1927. In 1928 he succeeded Charles Richardson as hunting and racing editor of The Field, becoming the youngest holder of that position since the magazine was founded in 1853. For the evening of the International Horse Show of 1934, Fawcett produced an equestrian event with special lighting effects called \\"The Moonlight Steeplechase\\", based on the engravings of Henry Alken.'International Horse Show Revival at Olympia' in The Times, issue 46787 dated 22 June 1934, p. 6, col. G The first scene depicted was at the Royal Artillery officers' mess at Ipswich in 1831, and after a challenge to a steeplechase had been accepted nightshirts and nightcaps were decided upon as the correct wear. The Times noted that this part of the show was \\"rollicking fun, as well as good horsemanship\\". Fawcett left The Field in 1936 to concentrate on writing books on fox hunting, racing and horses. In 1938‚Äì1939 he was Editor and Secretary of the United Services Association, then became Editor of the Hunts Association, which published many of his books. Fawcett hunted with the Zetland, the Hurworth, and the Cleveland, and claimed to have ridden to hounds at least once with nearly every pack of foxhounds in England, Scotland and Ireland. He bred hunters, and owned and trained steeplechasers at Croft Spa, North Yorkshire, as well as being a pioneer of Greyhound racing in England. He broadcast a series of talks on the greyhound on BBC Radio.

It was released by M√©li√®s's Star Film Company and is numbered 26 in its catalogues, where it is listed with the descriptive subtitle sc√®ne comique. Synopsis A man tries to go to sleep, but is disturbed by a giant bug climbing up the bed and onto the wall. He attacks the bug with a broom and disposes of it in a chamber pot in a compartment of his bedside table. Production A Terrible Night may have been inspired by a series of comic magic lantern slides, published in the 1880s by the English firm of Bamforth & Co Ltd. The film predates M√©li√®s's famous use of cinematic special effects; the first known M√©li√®s film with camera effects is The Vanishing Lady, made later in 1896. Rather, the giant bug is a simple pasteboard prop controlled with wire. The film was made with the M√©li√®s-Reulos portable camera in the open air, in the garden of M√©li√®s's home in Montreuil, using natural sunlight and a cloth backdrop. M√©li√®s himself played the man attempting to sleep. Survival Frame from the film suspected to be the original A Terrible Night A film commonly identified as A Terrible Night is known to survive and has appeared on various DVD collections. However, M√©li√®s's great-great- granddaughter, Pauline M√©li√®s, published findings in 2013 suggesting that the film commonly believed to be A Terrible Night is actually a later M√©li√®s film, A Midnight Episode, numbered 190 in the Star Films catalogues, and that the original A Terrible Night‚Äîfeaturing simpler scenery and different camera placement, but the same plot and the same bed‚Äîsurvives in two print copies: a photocollage held by the Cin√©math√®que Fran√ßaise and a flipbook published by L√®on Beaulieu around the turn of the century. If this hypothesis is accurate, both A Terrible Night and A Midnight Episode survive.

After Finland had made peace with the USSR, the Germans planned to fall back to defense lines built and equipped in advance across Finnish Lapland (Operation Birke). During the operation, the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht gave an order to move from Operation Birke to Operation Nordlicht on 4 October 1944. This meant that instead of evacuating everything and then fortifying on the strong defensive positions German 20th Mountain Army was to retreat according to a set timetable to a new defense line in Lyngen, Norway. The Germans retreated using scorched earth tactics, and destroyed almost all buildings and all boats in Finnmark, thus denying the enemy any facilities in the area. These same tactics had already been used in Finnish Lapland. The retreat ended on January 20, 1945. A detailed account of 'the Nazis' scorched earth campaign in Norway' by Vincent Hunt includes statements by eyewitnesses, photographs taken at the time and a map of locations and prisoner of war camps.

Maryland was Taxes in a model of bank portfolio choice. Taxes in a model of bank portfolio choice, by DeMarco, Edward Joseph Ph.D., University of Maryland College Park, 1991, 270 pages; AAT 9222675 DeMarco worked in the U.S. General Accounting Office for seven years (1986-1993). He then worked at the U.S. Treasury as director of the Office of Financial Institutions Policy (1993-2003) where he oversaw analyses of public policy issues involving government sponsored enterprises and other financial institutions. He then moved to the Social Security Administration (SSA) where he was the Assistant Deputy Commissioner for Policy (2003-2006). There he ran the SSA's policy, research, and statistics functions. His penultimate role before acting director of the FHFA was COO and Deputy Director Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) which he held for three years (October 2006-August 2009). In August 2009, President Obama promoted DeMarco to the position of acting director of Federal Housing Finance Agency.  Criticism  A Change.org petition from March 2012 claims that DeMarco is \\"the biggest obstacle to serious economic recovery. ... He oversees 60% of the country's home loans. Regardless of expert advice to provide principal reduction to homeowners whose homes are underwater, DeMarco has personally blocked it. While DeMarco stands by, the 5 largest private banks are already agreeing to provide principal reduction to homeowners under the 50 state Attorney Generals' Settlement\\" DeMarco (2012) reported that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac hold only 29 percent of the seriously delinquent loans (where the homeowner has missed at least 3 or more payments or is in foreclosure), which leaves 71 percent outside the conservatorship of FHFA: Only 3.8 percent of loans managed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are seriously delinquent, while 13.5 percent of other loans are seriously delinquent.DeMarco 2012, Table 1, p. 8. He provided further details about foreclosure prevention efforts both in and outside FHFA, noting that the FHFA re-default rates are lower than outside his purview.DeMarco 2012, pp. 4ff. Nobel economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman called for DeMarco's firing in his blog on July 31, 2012. Krugman said that DeMarco had rejected a Treasury Department request to offer debt relief to homeowners, with Treasury covering 63 percent of the debt relief. Krugman said DeMarco's rejection was based on the net loss debt relief would cost taxpayers. Krugman questioned DeMarco's analysis, but also said that \\"deciding whether debt relief is a good policy for the nation as a whole is not DeMarco's job. His job ‚Äî as long as he keeps it, which I hope is a very short period of time ‚Äî is to run his agency. If the Secretary of the Treasury, acting on behalf of the president, believes that it is in the national interest to spend some taxpayer funds on debt relief, in a way that actually improves the FHFA's budget position, the agency's director has no business deciding on his own that he prefers not to act.\\" http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/31/fire-ed-demarco/ Paul Krugman, New York Times July 31, 2012 Three days later, in a New York Times op-ed, Krugman reiterated that DeMarco's efforts, along with other Republican policy makers in the legislative branch, have stalled the economy, and called again for Obama to fire DeMarco and replace him with a recess appointment. Timothy Geithner is said to oppose DeMarco on this issue as well. DeMarco defended his position, claiming that allowing the debt relief would present a notable moral hazard, perhaps causing some homeowners to strategically allow themselves into debt to receive assistance.

It was instituted on 2 March 1994 by Presidential Decree 442. Until the re- establishment of the Order of St. Andrew in 1998, it was the highest order of the Russian Federation. The order's status was modified on 6 January 1999 by Presidential Decree 19 and again on 7 September 2010 by Presidential Decree 1099.  Statute of the Order  The Order \\"For Merit to the Fatherland\\" is a mixed civilian and military order created in four classes. It is awarded for outstanding contributions to the state associated with the development of Russian statehood, advances in labour, peace, friendship and cooperation between nations, or for significant contributions to the defence of the Fatherland. The highest of the four classes is the Order I class, the lowest being the Order IV class. These classes are awarded sequentially from the IV to the I class. Persons awarded the Order For Service to the Fatherland IV class should have already been awarded another Order of the Russian Federation and the Medal of the Order For Service to the Fatherland I class. For especially meritorious service to the State, the Order For Service to the Fatherland IV class may be conferred without previous award of the Medal of the Order For Service to the Fatherland I class if previously awarded the title \\"Hero of the Russian Federation\\", \\"Hero of the Soviet Union\\" or \\"Hero of Socialist Labor\\", as well as if previously awarded the Order of St. George, the Order of Alexander Nevsky, the Order of Suvorov, the Order of Ushakov, the Order of Zhukov, the Order of Kutuzov, the Order of Nakhimov, the Order For Courage, or who were awarded an honorary title of the Russian Federation. In exceptional cases, the President of the Russian Federation may decide to award the Order For Service to the Fatherland to persons not previously awarded state awards of the Russian Federation. Soldiers receiving the Order \\"For Merit to the Fatherland\\" for distinction in combat will receive the Order with Swords. Although previously awarded to foreign dignitaries and heads of state such as to French President Jacques Chirac, the 2010 decree abolished this practice making Russian Federation citizens the only possible recipients.  Award description  The order has a collar and four classes. The collar is the unique insignia of the President of the Russian Federation. The four classes of the Order are individually identified by the size and manner of wearing the two principal insignia of the Order, the cross and the star. * Cross: Is a silver-gilt ruby-enamelled bearing the gilt state emblem of the Russian Federation on its obverse.

The cross for the Order I class measures 60mm across and is affixed to a 100mm wide red sash worn over the right shoulder. The cross of the II and III classes measures 50mm across and is worn on a 45mm wide red neck ribbon for the II class, the III class ribbon is 24mm wide. The cross for the IV class measures 40mm across and hangs from a standard pentagonal mount covered by a red 24mm wide ribbon. * Star: The star of the Order is eight pointed. 82mm across and of highly polished silver.

Lauderdale, Florida, currently competing in the new for 2014 TUDOR United SportsCar Championship. The team was established in 2010 by Peter Baron and runs a Riley Daytona Prototype and two Prototype Challenge Oreca Chevrolet FLM09 cars. History Peter Baron is a successful entrepreneur, and former Le Mans 24 Hours class podium finisher, with 20 years of motorsports experience as a driver, manager and winning team owner. He has run successful motor racing teams since 2005 in the Indy Car Series, GRAND AM, and Indy Racing League Indy Car Series. He re-launched his team in January 2010 as Starworks Motorsport and competed in the entire Rolex Sports Car Series with one, and sometimes two, Riley-BMW Daytona Prototypes. In 2011, the Starworks switched to Ford power and fielded an additional Riley Daytona Prototype in select races, capped off by an end-of-season victory at Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course with drivers Ryan Dalziel and Enzo Potolicchio. In 2012, Starworks kicked off the year with pole at the 2012 24 Hours of Daytona by Ryan Dalziel en route to a second-place finish in the race with drivers Ryan Dalziel, Allan McNish, Lucas Luhr, Enzo Potolicchio and Alex Popow. The team started from pole position, led the most laps and had the fastest race lap. The team also debuted in the Continental Tire Sports Car Challenge with four Ford Mustang Boss 302R GTs. On February 2, 2012, Starworks announced that it would compete in the FIA World Endurance Championship, becoming only the second American team to do so. At the 2012 12 Hours of Sebring, Dalziel, Potolicchio and St√©phane Sarrazin managed to finish 1st in LMP2 ahead of Level 5 Motorsports and 3rd overall. This was their 2nd overall podium of the year after Daytona. At the 2012 24 Hours of Le Mans Starworks finished 1st in LMP2 and 7th overall. These milestones concluded an incredible season for Starworks with victories at the 12 Hours of Sebring, 24 Hours of Le Mans, the first Rolex Series race at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, plus a second-place finish in the ‚ÄòRolex 24 At Daytona‚Äô and third in the Sahlen‚Äôs Six Hours of The Glen. By doing so the team entered the history books by becoming the first LMP2 Champions in the WEC and the first North American team to win an FIA World Championship in 46 years. The team also won the 2012 GRAND-AM North American Endurance Championship and led with the most laps in a Daytona Prototype. Peter Baron has since been honoured by the Greater Pompano Beach Chamber of Commerce at a luncheon held at the Hillsboro Beach Club. He joined nine other area residents recognized for their accomplishments and achievements which have reflected positively on the community ‚Äî a ‚ÄúShining Light of the Community.‚Äù Peter also became the recipient of the 2012 Rolex Bob Snodgrass Award of Excellence. The announcement was made during the traditional prelude to the 2013 Rolex 24 at Daytona - the Grand Marshal Dinner ‚Äî which was held at the Daytona 500 Club and attended by 300 guests on January 25 2013. From a short-list of three highly successful team owners who competed in the 2012 Grand-Am Rolex Sports Car Series, a panel of motorsports professionals selected Baron as the award recipient. Stewart Wicht, President of Rolex Watch U.S.A., presented Baron with a specially-engraved Rolex Stainless Steel and Platinum Yacht-Master timepiece to commemorate the honor. ‚ÄúThis award goes to a team owner or manager in the Grand-Am series who best represents the qualities my father was known for: that is integrity, his passion for motorsports and his immense love for cars,‚Äù said Harris Snodgrass, son of the award's namesake.

Habitat This species lives in the demersal zone, and can be found at a depth range of 4 to 600 metres. Diet Chionodraco hamatus feeds most on small fish, krill, and fish larvae. Reproduction In common with many other channichthyid fishes, reproduction in Chionodraco hamatus involves laying eggs in a nest and parental guarding. Male prepares a nest and courts the female. Egg deposition (and presumably fertilization too) takes place at night. Female remains in the nest, guarding and fanning the eggs. Hatching takes place over a prolonged period of time. Male seems not to be involved in the care of the eggs. The larvae have a long pelagic phase.

In 1889, Edison sent Wangemann to keep the phonograph at the 1889 Paris Expo in good working condition. The trip was extended and Wangemann made numerous early sound recordings on wax cylinders, some of which were lost for more than 100 years. Found in 1957, but not revealed until 2012, they include the only known recording of Otto von Bismarck.  Early years  Wangemann was born in Berlin, Germany to Adalbert Theodor Wangemann (1815‚Äì1878) and Theodosia Sophie Ottilie Wangemann (n√©e Rhenius) (died 1878).

Retrieved February 5, 2012 Beginning with artists who were at the Paris Expo, Wangemann recorded pianist √âdouard Risler, the popular French caf√©-concert singer Paulus, and Charles-Marie Widor, an organist, among others. On August 29, 1889, he recorded four Hungarian singers, the Tacianu Sisters. This cylinder became a particular favorite of Wangemann's, and he lauded the \\"international value\\" of the new American invention, which enabled a German audience to hear a Russian melody once sung by a Hungarian quartet on a French stage. Edison, also traveling to Europe, sent Wangemann to Berlin, where he was to show the phonograph to Werner von Siemens. Von Siemens, a friend and business partner of Edison's, provided a special room for Wangemann, as well as a German mechanic to assist him while he toured Germany and Austria-Hungary. Wangemann made a number of experimental recordingsDavid L. Morton Jr., Sound recording: the life story of a technology The Johns Hopkins University Press (2004), p. 18\\\\. of prominent musicians and individuals. He also demonstrated the phonograph and recordings to different groups. On September 18, he gave a demonstration to scientists and professors in Heidelberg and two days later, to a group of electrotechnicians in Frankfurt. Wangemann's behavior at both of these events provoked some criticism from the audience. In Heidelberg, where Edison was the guest of honor, he took over the address, during which some of his comments were viewed as out of turn. In Frankfurt, where he spoke to a wider audience in a packed hall, he condescendingly made them look unsophisticated and feel unworthy of his time. During this period, Wangemann received invitations for demonstrations from Bismarck, Helmuth von Moltke, Wilhelm II and Czar Alexander III of Russia, then in Berlin. Wilhelm II did not make a recording, but his young sons, Wilhelm, Eitel Friedrich and Adalbert did record a cylinder. Wangemann's tour drew much attention, attracting additional invitations that made his schedule and budget difficult to maintain; those extending the invitations were equally hard pressed for time, and visits often had to be scheduled more than once. Some also wanted repeat visits from Wangemann. Edison and those traveling with him returned to the United States on September 28; Wangemann and his wife, who accompanied him, stayed in Europe. The first attempt to meet with Bismarck having failed, a second opportunity arose a week later for Wangemann and his wife to go to Friedrichsruh, to Bismarck's castle. While there, he recorded a wax cylinder, as reported in the press at the time, but which was then lost for more than 120 years. Bismarck, like everyone, was fascinated with the new invention and Wangemann spent several hours with him, even missing his train to Berlin.Oliver Das Gupta, \\"Bismarcks Stimme erklingt nach 123 Jahren\\" S√ºddeutsche Zeitung (January 31, 2012). Retrieved February 1, 2012 Wangemann met with Czar Alexander III on October 12. After weeks of postponements, this invitation that had meant so much to Wangemann found the Czar little interested in the phonograph and not interested in making a recording. A second visit took place, but shortly beforehand, the Czar was prevented from seeing Wangemann. While in Berlin, waiting to see the czar, Wangemann gave daytime demonstrations to artists, scientists and civil servants; in the evening, he gave demonstrations in private clubs to their invited members, often drawing crowds. Shortly before leaving Berlin, he organized a charity concert, where he charged admission, possibly his only European appearance with an entrance fee. Despite the 20-mark entrance fee, then equivalent to an average working man's weekly wage, the hall was full, showing how eager people were to hear the voices of Bismarck and the German crown princes. Wangemann (right) at the Edison laboratory, ca. May 1905 Wangemann, his wife and his assistants left Berlin on October 20 and, having been unable to see von Moltke on their first attempt, spent two days with him on the way to Vienna. Of the four cylinders recorded by von Moltke, only two are known to exist today. Wangemann's recordings of von Moltke are the only known recordings still audible of someone born in the 18th century. Wangemann and his party arrived in Vienna on October 25, where Wangemann held more demonstrations and made more recordings, including that of Alfred Gr√ºnfeld and Johannes Brahms. His primary motivation for the trip, however, was the invitation from Franz Joseph I to show him the phonograph. Again, though, Wangemann had to wait days for the meeting, during which time, he gave interviews to journalists, one a day, very likely recording them in demonstrating their utility. The journalist granted the interview was to transcribe it and share it with other newspapers. Wangemann met with Franz Joseph I on two occasions, but did not record his voice. On December 2, 1889, the night before leaving Vienna, Wangemann recorded Brahms playing an abbreviated version of one of his compositions. Wangemann returned to Berlin at one point, borrowing money from Siemens & Halske. Edison ordered him to return to the States not long after, having learned about the sums Wangemann had borrowed. Before leaving, Wangemann made some further recordings in Cologne, including one of Otto Neitzel, his only recording. Before Wangemann returned from Europe, Edison stopped the recording and experimentation at his laboratory. Wangemann worked at the laboratory until June 1890, then left for another exposition, after which he began working at the New York Phonograph Company, staying until 1893. He then stopped recording professionally, although he continued his own experiments at home, occasionally sharing them with Edison. Information about his work for the next several years is sketchy until he returned to Edison Laboratory in 1902, eventually resuming his experiments in the room where he had previously worked, as photographs show.Photos of Theo Wangemann Thomas Edison National Historical Park.

Editorship of Belorusskaya Delovaya Gazeta In 2003, she was editor of Belorusskaya Delovaya Gazeta (BDG), a popular business daily based in Minsk. The paper began to publish reports and features critical of Lukashenko's government, including articles covering the trials of Vikto Kazeko, former director of the state food company, and Mikhail Leonov, former director of Minsk Tractor Works. One edition also included a poll asking readers whether it was appropriate for Lukashenko to use his presidential plane for personal journeys. Soon the paper was reportedly subject to a campaign of official harassment, including \\"politically motivated tax inspections, death threats and detentions\\". Belarus's Information Ministry began to harass any printer that agreed to work with the paper, forcing BDG to print in Russia. The print edition of BDG had largely disappeared from Belarus by September 2004, leaving only the website. Kalinkina then took a leave of absence from the paper to work against a national referendum that would eliminate presidential term limits, allowing Lukashenko to serve indefinitely. The referendum passed. Editorship of Narodnaya Volya Kalinkina then accepted an editorship at the independent newspaper Narodnaya Volya (English \\"The People's Will\\"), Belarus's largest-circulation opposition daily. In October 2005, pressure from the Information Ministry prevented Belarusian printers from working with the paper, forcing Kalinkina again to contract with a printer in Smolensk, Russia. Beginning on 1 January 2006, the Belarusian post office refused to distribute the paper, and an entire print run of 30,000 copies was confiscated by police on 9 January. When citizens of Salihorsk began a petition on the paper's behalf, police made visits to the homes of the signatories to interrogate them. On 13 March 2006, a week before the presidential election that would usher in Lukashenko's third term, Narodnaya Volya, BDG, and Tovarishch had their print runs abruptly cancelled by their Smolensk supplier. Kalinkina told The New York Times that she believed Belarusian government pressure to be responsible, saying, \\"When, a week before the election, someone refuses to print three papers, it is clear there are political reasons.\\" In April 2010, computers were seized from Kalinkina and fellow Narodnaya Volya reporter Marina Koktysh, as well as Charter 97 editor Natalya Radina and Novaya Gazeta journalist Irina Khalip as part of an investigation into a slander case filed by Ivan Korzh. The four were also brought to a police station for questioning. In September, Kalinkina wrote an article investigating the recent suspicious death of Charter 97 editor-in- chief Aleh Byabenin, and received several death threats shortly after, prompting the human rights organization Norwegian Helsinki Committee to issue an alert on her behalf. On 29 April 2011, the Information Ministry again attempted to shut down Narodnaya Volya, filing a motion with the Supreme Economic Court of Belarus for the newspaper's closure. After 11 years in Narodnaya Volya, Kalinkina resigned in 2016. According to her statement, she left on friendly terms with the editors office and will continue to collaborate with the newspaper as a journalist. Recognition In 2004, the Committee to Protect Journalists awarded Kalinkina its International Press Freedom Award, \\"an annual recognition of courageous journalism\\". The award citation praised her \\"critical reporting on various government abuses\\" in the face of \\"years of legal and bureaucratic harassment from Belarusian authorities\\". In 2015 Kalinkina received the award \\"For Personal Courage\\" from the Charter 97 organization.

It is an arcade adventure game in which players control a boy scout. The object of the game is to unlock a safe within a mansion to obtain pills for the mansion's owner, a mad scientist, who has collapsed. This requires the player to traverse the mansion's rooms while avoiding hazards such as dangerous house servants and fatal falls. The game was developed by John F. Cain, who had previously created Booty, a popular budget game. Moonlight Madness was criticized for its price on release, ¬£7.95 in the UK, as well its technical issues. The game's graphics, gameplay and sound were negatively rated by critics, though some reviewers were more positive over these different aspects of the game. Gameplay Players must guide a boy scout through a 43-room mansion in order to obtain 16 keys and a combination before running out of time. These unlock a safe containing the pills needed to save the mansion owner's life. It is necessary to jump onto platforms and evade enemies in order to progress. At the start of the game the player has three lives; a life is lost should the boy scout fall too far or come into contact with one of the mansion's servants or traps. Rooms contain doors that can be entered to move around the mansion, as well as push buttons and hazards. Pressing buttons can result in lifts being activated, platforms appearing or in an enemy appearing. One of the mansion's rooms is a corridor of eight doors with a large pair of eyes above them; this room acts as a maze. A tune is played continuously during play, but can be toggled on or off. Plot The player character, a boy scout, has approached a mansion looking for work during Bob a Job week. The door is answered by an old man wearing horn-rimmed glasses‚Äîthe owner of the mansion. The man, a mad scientist, expresses surprise that the boy has managed to get past the guards and booby traps in the mansion's grounds. As the boy scout explains the reason for his visit, the scientist collapses, asking for his pills. At this point the game begins. The player must gather the 16 keys needed to unlock the safe and retrieve the scientist's pills before he passes away. During play the boy scout must negotiate the mansion's rooms, avoiding hazards and the mansion's staff, who have been told to protect the inventions within the mansion, using lethal force if necessary. The staff are unaware of the boy scout's purpose and will attack him should they come into contact. Development and release The game was created by John F. Cain, who had previously developed the successful budget game Booty for Firebird Software. By this point Cain had also developed several titles for Rabbit Software, such as Potty Painter. Moonlight Madness was published by Bubble Bus in the United Kingdom and Spain in 1986; the original price was ¬£7.95 in the United Kingdom. Moonlight Madness was re-released on budget software labels; Blue Ribbon Software in the United Kingdom, Zafi Chip and Z Cobra in Spain. Blue Ribbon Software was a label belonging to CDS Microsystems, both of the Spanish budget labels belonged to Zafiro Software Division. The game was published on the covertape of the February 1991 issue of Your Sinclair magazine. The covertape also featured Marsport, Ninja Hamster and Wizard's Lair. Reception Moonlight Madness received negative and mediocre ratings from reviewers, who either criticized the game overall or different aspects of it. Direct comparisons with Booty feature in many reviews. The game's price was in particular a common complaint among reviewers, who stated that it should have been a budget-priced title. One reviewer stated that it would have been better received as a budget title, another stated \\"Like Booty, Moonlight Madness would be all right at budget price\\". Your Sinclair's reviewer began their piece by stating \\"Hmmm, don't like the title Moonlight Madness much, howzabout Daylight Robbery. Catchy, ain't it?\\" Computer Gamer's reviewer stated \\"Had it been released on a budget label, Moonlight Madness would have been fair value for money. As it is, it is grossly overpriced.\\" The boy scout (bottom left) makes his way through the maze corridor Reviewers highlighted technical issues in the game. The eight door maze room was thought to be a bug, a software error, by two people at ZX Computing magazine. Because the game contains no reset feature they reloaded the game from cassette in order to continue playing. The player character's movements were criticised for being jerky and prone to stopping at infrequent intervals. One of Crash magazine's staff stated that the boy scout's movement to the left was quick; \\"as if there's a force ten gale blowing to the left.\\" They added \\"When any attempt is made to move right, all the moving characters on the screen slow right down.\\" In-game objects are removed from view when either the player character or one of the mansion staff move in front of them. When the player redefines the game's keyboard controls, allowing them to choose which keys move the boy scout during play, the pause key and music toggle key are not included. As a result it is possible to double-up movement controls with these two functions, effectively causing the game to pause and unpause or for the music to toggle constantly as the player moves in that direction. Reviewers' opinions on the graphics and gameplay were largely negative, while opinions on the title's music varied. The background music was described as \\"...the only thing that is remotely interesting about this appallingly tedious game...\\" by Popular Computing Weekly's reviewer. He followed this by stating \\"At first it sounds all right, if a little monotonous, then it begins to grate the nerves. After a while it begins to take on all the appeal of the Chinese water torture.\\" Crash magazine's three reviewers were more positive about the music, stating \\"The sound is fairly well done...\\", \\"The title screen plays a nice tune...\\" and \\"...the game's drawing point is the sound...\\" The game's graphics were described as \\"fairly crude\\", \\"unattractive\\" and \\"...none too exciting, consisting of colourful but flickery characters.\\" One reviewer stated \\"The graphics are large and colourful but there is a lot of character clash...\\" Overall impressions of Moonlight Madness were negative. Crash magazine's reviewers compared the game unfavourably to Booty. One expressed disappointment because of Bubble Bus' history of releasing \\"great arcade/adventures\\".

History Once Parbatipur came up as a railway station on the Chilahati- Parbatipur-Santahar-Darshana Line in 1876, it became a centre of further railway development. There were two developments, one eastward and the other westward. North Bengal State Railway opened a metre gauge line to Kaunia in 1879. Two narrow gauge lines were laid by Eastern Bengal Railway from Kaunia to Dharla River, thereby creating the Kaunia‚ÄìDharlla State Railway. The Kaunia Dharla railway lines were converted to metre gauge in 1901. The Kaunia‚ÄìDharla line was extended to Amingaon in 1908. The Assam Behar State Railway started building westward in 1884 and by 1889, Parbatipur was connected with Katihar in Bihar. By the turn of the century Lalmonirhat Junction had emerged as an important railway centre. Bengal Dooars Railway constructed a line to Malbazar. Cooch Behar State Railway constructed the Geetaldaha-Jayanti narrow gauge line. Links were established with Assam, with the Golokganj‚ÄìAmingaon line coming up. Assam links There were two Assam links through this area, before the Partition of India. The first and more important one was through Mogalhat‚ÄìGeetaldaha‚ÄìBamanhat‚ÄìGolokganj. Even when railway links were restored between Pakistan and India in 1955, the line was in order and was one of the agreed transit points. The railway bridge across the Dharla River was subsequently partially washed out and the railway link was snapped. The second link through Kurigram and Sonahat was snapped earlier with a bridge being washed away within what is now Bangladesh. In 1955, the link was not there. Defunct rail transit point The Burimari‚ÄìChangrabandha rail transit point has become defunct. The Indian side of the line is now made BG and is operational between New Mal Junction to Changrabandha. New line has been made to connect New Cooch Behar from Changrabandha. Bangladeshi side of Burimari- Lalmonirhat track was in bad shape with frequent derailments. There were two local trains in a day running at a limited speed of 8‚Äì14 km per hour (as against 45 km per hour in normal sections).[5][6] But now this side of the Metre gauge line is fully constructed to Lalmonirhat in 2012. Now there running 8 trains daily to different City. The speed limit is 70 kmph. Total nine station of this section are remodeled. Bangladesh now making the whole section DG to revive this route. A bridge in River Dharla is being constructed for this.

He was featured several times on one of the iconic black and white TV series of the 1950s Adventures of Superman; his appearances are still seen on television today. He also played roles in the historic Hal Roach short comedy films as one of Hal Roach's All-Stars in the two-reel films often shown in theaters during the World War II era. Nelson was a nightclub master of ceremonies in the United States and abroad.https://archive.org/stream/variety112-1933-10/variety112-1933-10_djvu.txt Nelson and his wife, violinist Irene Knight, developed a musical comedy act that was featured in several major markets during the 1930s. The Nelson- Knight music and comedy duo often worked shows featuring vaudeville and Broadway ballerina Jeanne Devereaux Frequently cast as a villain, Nelson was a familiar face during the infancy of network and syndicated television. He played in roles on early television westerns and police procedurals,i.e., The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp, Death Valley Days, Tombstone Territory, Highway Patrol, M Squad and Jack Webb's original Dragnet. Nelson and his mother, Nettie Newman, were close with the actor Jack Haley. Nelson made his first film appearances in 1933 in Hal Roach comedy short subjects. His (well-honed) blue-collar appearance made him a likely choice for roles as cab drivers, bartenders, and gunmen. For instance in the five-year run of The Adventures Superman television series, Nelson played five different thugs. Nelson's last role was in the 1961 in Pocketful of Miracles.

It existed in what is now Morocco during the Cenomanian age of the Late Cretaceous Epoch. The type species Aegisuchus witmeri was named in 2012 by paleontologists Casey Holliday and Nicholas Gardner, who nicknamed it \\"Shieldcroc\\" for the shield-like shape of its skull. A. witmeri is known from a single partial skull including the braincase and skull roof. Description Hypothetical restoration Aegisuchus is known only from a partial braincase and skull roof cataloged as ROM 54530. It is diagnosed by several autapomorphies, or unique features. At the center of the skull table is a raised and rough-surfaced boss on the parietal bone that is shaped like a circle. On either side of this boss are holes called dorsotemporal fenestrae, and the surrounding bone is relatively smooth. The quadrate bone in the temporal region of the skull has a rectangular projection called the adductor tubercle, which served as an attachment for muscles that closed the jaw. At the front of the skull table, projections on the laterosphenoid bones called capitate processes face out to the side. This feature is also seen in the skulls of living gharials, but evolved independently in each group. Also on the front surface are two holes of the dorsotemporal fenestrae, which pass through the skull and open at the skull table. On the front surface, a ridge of bone or torus makes up the lateral edge of each hole. The back of the skull is wide, with large projections on the exoccipital bones that would have anchored large epaxial muscles in the top part of the neck. =Size= At 40 cubic centimetres, the braincase of Aegisuchus is much larger in volume than that of any other crocodyliform. Based on the ratio of braincase to skull length in other crocodilians, the total skull length of Aegisuchus is estimated to have been in length. A similar ratio between braincase and body length puts Aegisuchus at long when based on the proportions of long-snouted gharials, or long when based on the proportions of short-snouted crocodiles. However, these proportions have been met with a lot of scrutiny, and it is more likely that Aegisuchus reached less than in length. =Integument= 3D restoration of the holotype including an endocast of the brain The circular boss of roughened bone on the skull table is one of the most unusual features of Aegisuchus. As in most crocodilians, the rough-surfaced region was probably covered in a thick skin that tightly adhered to the skull. Surrounding the boss, the smooth-surfaced region bears several deep parallel channels for blood vessels, suggesting that thicker, more complex skin tissue covered this region. Vascularization is not seen in any other crocodilian, and may have been unique to Aegisuchus. Given that the blood vessel channels run into the braincase, the vascularized tissue may have served a thermoregulatory role by heating blood going to the brain and eyes. The central boss may have been used in mating displays, appearing as an eyespot. Modern crocodilians raise their heads out of the water as a social signal in mating displays; as a close relative of crocodilians, Aegisuchus likely had similar mating rituals. =Musculature= The flattened shape of the skull of Aegisuchus suggests that it was an ambush predator resting at the surface of the water. Although only the back of the skull is known, other characteristics can be inferred from the closely related Aegyptosuchus. Aegisuchus probably had eyes that faced directly upward, with no raised ridges surrounding the sockets. A strut of bone called the postorbital bar, which in most crocodilians is vertically oriented, would have been almost flat. The flattened skull of Aegisuchus required significant alteration to jaw muscles. The adductor muscles that close the jaw shifted to a more vertical orientation in Aegisuchus. Muscles like the adductor mandibulae externus medialis, which are weak in most crocodilians, became more important as jaw closers and were greatly enlarged. The broad-surfaced occipital region at the back of the skull provides a large attachment area for the splenius capitis muscles of the neck. With a long flattened snout, Aegisuchus would have had great difficulty in raising its head and opening its mouth if it did not have large neck muscles. A depressed region in the lower part of the back of the skull suggests that the jaw adductor muscles were also large, facilitating jaw opening. A similar mechanism for lifting the head and opening the jaws is seen in the Late Triassic amphibian Gerrothorax. Aegisuchus has a very flexible articulation between the skull and vertebral column, allowing a greater degree of skull elevation than other crocodilians. Classification Comparison with Aegyptosuchus Paleoenvironment During the Late Cretaceous, northern Africa was a humid region near the Tethys Ocean, a seaway between the southern continents of Gondwana and northern land masses of Laurasia. At this time, the Kem Kem Beds of Morocco were deposited in a freshwater delta system. Aegisuchus lived within this delta alongside fishes, turtles, snakes and varanid lizards, pterosaurs, and sauropod and theropod dinosaurs. Stomatosuchids are also known from the Kem Kem Beds, and probably shared a close ecological niche with Aegisuchus as river predators. With its flattened skull, Aegisuchus was probably an ambush predator. Possible prey include coelacanths, lungfish, and bichirs, all of which have been found in the Kem Kem beds. As an opportunistic predator, Aegisuchus may also have preyed on land vertebrates such as reptiles. Aegisuchus could have potentially fallen prey to much larger predators such as Spinosaurus. =Biogeography= The Late Cretaceous was an important time in crocodilian evolution because many land masses were breaking up. What is now Europe and Asia was drifting away from Africa to form the Tethys Ocean, while North America continued to separate from the rest of Laurasia as the Atlantic Ocean widened. With the presence of several early crocodilians like Borealosuchus, North America is often hypothesized as the continent of origin for Crocodylia. However, the presence of agyptosuchids such as Aegisuchus in northern Africa suggests that early crocodilian evolution was focused instead around the Tethys Ocean. The agyptosuchids represent a highly specialized and highly endemic branch of crocodyliforms at a time when crocodilian diversity and geographic range were expanding.

In 1978, he ran across the U.S. to benefit the Jimmy Fund and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. He is currently the race director of the Boston Athletic Association (B.A.A.) Boston Marathon and his team at DMSE Sports, Inc. have organized more than 1,000 mass- participatory endurance events since he founded the organization in 1981.  Athletic achievements  In 1978, McGillivray ran across the U.S. from Medford, Oregon, to his hometown of Medford, Massachusetts. Over the course of 80 days, he ran a distance of 3,452 miles, averaging 42 miles a day. He culminated his cross-America run by running into in Fenway Park in Boston. His effort raised funds for the Jimmy Fund and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. In 1980, McGillivray completed several athletic endeavors. * His Wrentham State School 24-Hour Run traversed 120 miles in 24 hours through 31 communities in southeastern Massachusetts, ending in Foxboro Stadium at halftime of a New England Patriots game. It was held to benefit the Wrentham State School for the Mentally Retarded, and the event raised more than $10,000 for the handicapped. * He ran the East Coast Run to once again benefit the Jimmy Fund. From Winter Haven, Florida, to Boston, Massachusetts, McGillivray ran 1,520 miles and was joined by Robert Hall, a pioneer of wheelchair marathoning. While in Washington, D.C., the duo met with President Jimmy Carter at the White House. * He entered his first Hawaii Ironman Triathlon. He finished 14th in the competition, and was the 30th person to have ever completed an Ironman, an individual endurance event consisting of three back-to-back distance events: a 2.4 mile rough, open ocean water swim, followed by a 112-mile bike race and finishing up with a 26.2-mile marathon run He would go on to complete eight more Hawaii Ironmans over his career. During the following year, McGillivray: * Ran in the Empire State Building Run Up, an 86-story, 1,575-step run. He placed 10th overall with a time of 13 minutes, 27 seconds. * Ran the Boston Marathon in 3:14 while blindfolded and being escorted by two guides to raise $10,000 for the Carroll Center for the Blind in Newton, Massachusetts. * He participated in the annual New England Run where he triathloned (ran, cycled, and swam) 1,522 miles throughout the six New England states raising $55,000 for the Jimmy Fund. The event required a run up and down Mount Washington and swimming two miles across Lake Winneapesaukee, both in New Hampshire, as well as swimming one mile from Woods Hole in Cape Cod toward Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, ending the course with running three miles alongside inmates within the Walpole State Prison. He raised $55,000 for the Jimmy Fund. A year later he swam more than seven miles in the Martha's Vineyard Swim, from Martha's Vineyard to Falmouth, Massachusetts, raising funds for the Jimmy Fund and was greeted on the shore by runners such as Alberto Salazar. *He formed the first sanctioned running club inside a maximum security institution at Walpole State Prison in Massachusetts. He conducted and ran in numerous distance races inside the prison yard, including completing and winning a full 26.2 mile marathon against inmates. During the rest of the 1980s, he continued to combine his love of athletic endeavors and fundraising for charity. * In 1983, he participated in the Jimmy Fund 24-Hour Swim, swimming for 24 consecutive hours in the Olympic-size Medford High School pool, which totaled 1,884 lengths and covering 26.2 miles (distance of the Boston Marathon), again raising funds for the Jimmy Fund. * Also in 1983, McGillivray took part in the Merrimack College New England Bike Ride where he cycled more than 1,000 miles throughout six New England states in 14 days to raise money for a scholarship fund for his alma mater, Merrimack College. * In 1986, McGillivray biked again for 24 consecutive hours around a five-mile loop course in Medford, Massachusetts while simultaneously directing the annual Bay State Triathlon being held on the course at the same time. He covered a total of 385 miles, again raising money for the Jimmy Fund. * In 1989, he founded the Boston Marathon Jimmy Fund Walk, an event that has raised more than $5 million a year for the Jimmy Fund of Boston. Each year, nearly 10,000 walkers walk along the famous Boston Marathon course. In 2004, McGillivray and other marathon runners ran across the U.S. following the same path he took in 1978, raising $300,000 for five charities benefiting children. Each year McGillivray runs his birthday age in miles, a tradition he started when he was 12 and realized that running was his passion. McGillivray has also run the Boston Marathon each year since 1973; the first 16 years as an entrant and since working with the race as its director, has run the course after his duties are completed. Dave McGillivray runs in the Feaster Five Thanksgiving Day Road Race Most recently, in February 2018, he completed the World Marathon Challenge, which consists of seven marathons on seven continents in seven days. Dave McGillivray holds a copy of his illustrated children's book, Dream Big In 2006, McGillivray wrote ‚ÄúThe Last Pick‚Äù with writer Linda Glass Fechter, chronicling his childhood as the last pick for team sports because of his small stature, telling readers never to underestimate their own ability to set and achieve goals. The book also covers his life as an athlete and race director. In 2018 the first of his illustrated children's books was published. \\"Dream Big: A True Story of Courage and Determination \\" is the nonfiction story about reaching deep and showing extreme determination in the face of doubt, disappointment, and loss.  Professional life  McGillivray created DMSE Sports, Inc. in 1981, a firm that manages mass participatory road race events such as marathons, half marathons, 10Ks, 5-milers, 5Ks, and charity walks. He has worked with the Boston Marathon since 1988, first as technical director, and then as race director beginning in 2001.

The organization works to ensure that human rights are respected in practice. Until it was closed down in 2008, the Norwegian Helsinki Committee was affiliated with the International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights, which was a self-governing group of 44 national Helsinki Committees and associated organizations in Europe, Central Asia and North America. It is based in Oslo, Norway. Objective The activity of the Norwegian Helsinki Committee is founded on the principle that the documentation of human rights violations and the presence of a strong civil society is of vital importance in order for states to protect human rights within their borders, as well as abroad. The goal is to contribute to the documentation of human rights violations in the OSCE area, give assistance to individuals and influence governments and international organizations to give priority to human rights. The NHC places particular emphasis on freedom of speech, freedom of association, the right to self-determination, minority rights, the right to freedom of thought and religion, and personal security. Activity The work of the Norwegian Helsinki Committee is particularly concerned with states in Europe, Central Asia and North America. In the later years the international work has focused particularly on former Soviet states and the Western Balkans, i.e. the countries of the former Yugoslavia and Albania. Central parts of its activity include monitoring and reporting of human rights violations, human rights education and democracy support in the form of transfer of knowledge and financial support to projects directed by local human rights organizations. The Norwegian Helsinki Committee has also been monitoring and reporting from elections in a wide range of countries, as well as arranged for international election monitoring in Norway. In addition, the Committee aims at influencing the opinion and authorities concerning current issues, through media statements and participation in the public debate, and putting human rights issues on the public agenda through its own webpage, annual reports and newsletters. The Norwegian Helsinki Committee participates in meetings in the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the Council of Europe and the United Nations. In the recent years, it has also been occupied with promoting the use of international judicial institutions like the European Court of Human Rights and the International Criminal Court in individual cases of principal importance.

Ebony magazine named him as one of the \\"30 on the Rise\\" to watch in the industry, and the NAACP recognized him as one of \\"40 Power Players Under 40.\\" Career Murray was born in Warrenton, Virginia, before relocating to Falls Church, Virginia. He attended Norfolk State University, where he studied Mass Communications. He then interned at the Washington, DC radio station WPGC 95.5 FM, which kicked off his professional career in the entertainment industry. While working as an intern, mid-host Michel Wright hired Murray to research stories for her on-air entertainment news segment because she recognized his passion for celebrity news and pop culture. At the height of the dot-com boom, Murray launched his own career as an entertainment news reporter from Washington, DC, first with an email newsletter called Garek News before landing a weekly column in the Electronic Urban Report radio newswire and online site, now known as EURweb.com. His writing career would continue to flourish with a widely popular entertainment column called BV Buzz that he penned for AOL's Black Voices channel for seven years. While working for AOL, Murray landed an additional opportunity as a vacation-relief columnist for the New York Daily News, where he would fill in for the famous \\"Rush & Molloy\\" columnists. He would also pen over 20 magazine cover stories for publications like Black Elegance, Savoy, Smooth and Jewel magazines. In September 2006, he also joined the nationally syndicated Tom Joyner Morning Show as an on-air personality, making his one of the youngest contributors to ever join the Urban Adult Contemporary radio program. Murray also started doing contributing segments for television, initially making his TV debut on an E! Entertainment series called \\"Love Chain.\\" He would go on to appear as a subject matter expert on both Court TV and HLN, as well as doing commentary on round-up shows like VH1's The Fabulous Life of... and E!'s True Hollywood Story, Hollywood Wives' Tales and Relatively Famous.

On January 13, 2011, Murray announced while hosting a showcase for EMI Gospel in Nashville, Tennessee, during the Stellar Awards weekend that he was launching a digital talent competition for 10 unsigned artists for EMI Gospel. The project was called Jawn Murray presents Untapped and Murray was the executive producer for the compilation. Later that year in 2011, he would announce he was leaving AOL Black Voices following the company's merger with The Huffington Post; as well as departing the Tom Joyner Morning Show. Murray felt as though he had neglected his first love, television, and wanted to focus his interests on opportunities in TV. In late 2011, the media personality would become a regular fixture on both HLN and CNN. His visibility was increased during the week that Whitney Houston died in 2012, as Murray would appear as a subject matter expert on 21 TV network shows including NBC's Today and multiple series on CNN, HLN, BBC, MSNBC and Fox News. On the day of Houston's funeral, Murray did live commentary for the inaugural episode of MSNBC's Melissa Harris-Perry Show. In April 2014, Murray co-hosted ABC's The View just two weeks before the show's creator Barbara Walters retired. During the episode, Walters turned to him on live TV and declared: \\"I love your way with words.\\" He would go on to appear as a panelist on other talk shows like The Meredith Vieira Show and The Wendy Williams Show, and taped numerous episodes on the TV One series Unsung. He has also gone on to host programming for Travel Channel (Night Crawl New York with Jawn Murray and The Maryland Renaissance Festival), Epix (Top Five: A Red Carpet Special) and NFL Network (NFL Fan Pass: Phoenix.)

It is subordinate to the North Korean Ministry of Railways.http://www.cchere.com/topic/3893100 History The design team at work on designing the Red Flag 1-class locomotive in 1960. A Red Flag 1-class locomotive: North Korea's first domestically-built locomotive. Narrow-gauge diesel locomotive built by the Kim Chong-t'ae Works in 1972 Initially established as a repair facility for rolling stock during the Japanese occupation of Korea, becoming the state-owned West P'y≈èngyang Railway Factory on 10 November 1945. In 1960, the facility repaired 210 steam locomotives, 1,800 freight cars and 120 passenger cars. It was expanded with Polish assistance in the late 1950s to manufacture electric locomotives as well, with work on the manufacturing facility completed on 29 August 1959. In 1961 it was renamed P'y≈èngyang Electric Locomotive Works, and the first electric locomotive manufactured in North Korea was built at this factory in 1961, and the plant was awarded a medal following a visit by Kim Il-sung. Kim Il-sung paid another visit to the factory on 27 September 1987, to inspect the first completed production unit of the Red Flag 6-class articulated 8-axle electric locomotive. Following the execution of South Korean revolutionary activist Kim Chong-t'ae, a member of the Revolutionary Party for Reunification, the factory was renamed in his honour in 1969. Manufacturing activities A Red Flag 2-class electric locomotive in P'y≈èngyang. As the only plant in North Korea capable of manufacturing electric and diesel locomotives. the history of the Kim Chong-t'ae Electric Locomotive Works is intricately tied into the history of diesel and electric motive power in North Korea. From 1961 the plant had the capacity to build 30 new electric locomotives per year in addition to the repair and construction of passenger cars. At present, the facility covers , of which construction facilities cover divided into 15 workshops. The company employs 5000 people. It is capable of handling 100-110 electric locomotives per year, of which 30-50 can be of new construction; the biggest single-year output was 60 new units. Ch'≈èngny≈ènj≈èl Kiny≈èm-class electric locomotive built at Kim Chong-t'ae Works. North Korea produced its first electric locomotives in 1961, the Red Flag 1. Since then, the Kim Chong-t'ae Works has manufactured a number of other types, such as the Red Flag 6-class electric articulated locomotive and several other electric types, the K≈≠msong and Saeby≈èl-class diesel locomotives along with other diesel shunters, the Juche-class 4-section electric multiple-unit train and various diesel and electric locomotives for narrow gauge lines. In recent years, the factory has also manufactured streetcars to a Czech ƒåKD Tatra design. Since the 1990s, an important undertaking has been the conversion of diesel locomotives to electric operation. The biggest such project thus far has been the conversion of the Soviet-made M62-type diesel locomotives to electric operation, resulting in the Kanghaenggun-class locomotives. Following a visit of North Korean leader Kim Jong-il on 5 January 2002, the plant began work on a new range of electric locomotives, which ultimately led to their latest product, the S≈èngun Red Flag-class electric freight locomotive with asynchronous motors with a maximum speed of .http://www.naenara.com.kp/en/periodic/times/index.php?contents+13089+2011-01-03+502+9 The first prototype was unveiled on 5 January 2011, and production versions have since begun entering service.http://dprk114514.blog.fc2.com/blog- category-1.html The plant has also produced a trainset for the P'y≈èngyang Metro, unveiled at a ceremony at the plant on 23 October 2015, with Kim Jong- un in attendance.http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/traction-rolling- stock/single-view/view/kim-jong-un-inspects-north-korean-metro-trainset.html The trainset was delivered in late 2015 and went into service in January 2016. Current production consists of the S≈èngun Red Flag 4-axle locomotives, the Red Flag 5400-class Bo-Bo-Bo electric locomotive, the Red Flag 7-class electric articulated locomotive, along with a small number of diesel-hydraulic and kW diesel-mechanical locomotives, narrow-gauge electric and narrow-gauge diesel locomotives.

The age of radio communication began with the development of wireless telegraphy around 1900, in which Morse code could be transmitted over large distances using simple spark gap or carbon arc transmitting equipment, and various types of detectors for reception. Guglielmo Marconi achieved international fame in 1901 when he succeeded in sending a simple message in Morse code - the letter \\"s\\" - across the Atlantic from Cornwall in England to Newfoundland in Canada. Women as wireless operators Women had worked as telegraph operators since the late 1840s, and it was not long before women telegraphers began to work as wireless operators as well. In early 1901, the announcement of the inauguration of a Hawaiian inter-island communications system noted that four of the fourteen operators were women.\\"Marconi's System Finally a Success\\", Honolulu Republican, February 2, 1901, p. 1. In 1906, Anna Nevins, who had worked as a telegrapher for Western Union, began work as a wireless operator for Lee de Forest's station \\"NY\\", located at 42 Broadway in New York City. She was later employed as a wireless operator at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City.Moreau, Louise R., \\"The Feminine Touch in Telecommunications.\\" The A.W.A. Review, Volume 4, 1989, pp. 79-80. Early female shipboard operators One of the earliest applications of wireless telegraphy was enabling communication between ships at sea and land stations. While early ships' operators were mostly male, some women entered the field as well. The primary requirement was a knowledge of Morse code and equipment operation, which many female telegraph operators possessed. Perhaps the earliest woman to operate on shipboard was Medora Olive Newell, an experienced telegrapher who was a passenger on the Cunard liner Slavonia in 1904, when Hungarian members of the Hague Peace Commission wished to send a birthday greeting to Emperor Franz Josef of Austria-Hungary. Medora Olive Newell (1872 - December 31, 1946) began work as a telegraph operator in Durango, Iowa, in 1886 at the age of fourteen. In 1897, she moved to Chicago and became a commercial operator for the Postal Telegraph Company.Obituary for Medora O. Newell, Long Beach Independent, Long Beach, CA, January 1, 1947. Medora Olive Newell, Early Wireless Telegrapher. Source: Chicago Daily Tribune, , February 13, 1907. Newell‚Äôs first-class operator pay enabled her to live a fairly affluent lifestyle; as Telegraph Age reported in 1909, ‚ÄúMiss Newell has been in the habit of spending her vacations abroad, and has always made these trips the occasion for investigating telegraph and railway management and operation in European countries.‚ÄùTelegraph Age, June 1, 1909, p. 396. On her return voyage from Europe in 1904, she found herself aboard the Cunard liner Slavonia together with members of the Hague Peace Commission, who were on their way to the United States to persuade President Theodore Roosevelt to call another international conference to continue the work begun at the Hague in 1899. The Hungarian members of the delegation wished to send a birthday greeting to Emperor Franz Josef of Austria-Hungary by wireless, but the ship‚Äôs wireless operator was unable to send the message. Newell, who, according to Telegraph Age, ‚Äúhad a good working knowledge of wireless,‚Äù took her place at the key and soon had successfully transmitted the greeting. The grateful delegates thanked her for her assistance, and the secretary of the Hungarian parliament invited her to visit Hungary as the guest of the nation.Jepsen, My Sisters Telegraphic, p. 69. In the United States, the Wireless Ship Act of 1910 required US ships to be equipped with wireless equipment for the first time, and to have an operator on board who was capable of sending and receiving messages. The first woman to be officially employed as a shipboard wireless operator was Graynella Packer, a telegrapher from Jacksonville, Florida, who was employed as a wireless operator for the United Wireless Telegraph Company aboard the steamship Mohawk from November 1910 to April 1911. Packer started practicing telegraphy in order to send messages in code to her school friends as a young girl. She eventually took on telegraphy as a career because her eyes were not strong and 'handling a key is no strain on the sight'.(January 3, 1911). Girl Wireless Operator. Publisher: St. Petersburg (Florida) Evening Independent She became manager of the Postal Telegraph office in Sanford, Florida, before hiring onto the Mohawk as the first woman wireless operator to serve aboard a steamship in a commercial capacity. After operating in full charge of the wireless, she eventually moved on to become an elected member of the Oklahoma State Bar Association from Oklahoma City in 1922.(1992)Proceedings of the Annual Meetings of the Oklahoma State Bar. Page 227. Publisher: Oklahoma State Bar Association Graynella Packer, Wireless Operator, 1910. Source: The Electrical Experimenter, October 1916. The Radio Act of 1912 required radio operators in the U.S. to be licensed for the first time. The first woman to be licensed as a shipboard operator was Mabelle Kelso, who passed the operator's examination and received her operating license in January 1912. Mabelle Kelso was a native of Seattle, Washington, and had been previously employed as a stenographer. After passing a U.S. Navy Department examination, she was hired by the United Wireless Telegraph Company and assigned a position as an operator on board the SS Mariposa, a steamship which travelled between Seattle and Alaska. Her appointment as shipboard operator generated some opposition from members of Congress who wished to bar women from holding such positions on seagoing ships; however, she received support from the Pacific Coast Wireless Inspector of United Wireless, who stated that \\"he knew of no law which would bar Miss Kelso from her position.\\"\\"Miss Kelso of Seattle, Only Woman to Hold License as Wireless Operator,\\" Atlanta Constitution, July 7, 1912.\\"May Flash Law On Wireless Girl,\\" Oakland Tribune, Oakland, California, July 25, 1912. By 1913, over 30 women had been licensed as shipboard operators.Moreau, \\"The Feminine Touch in Telecommunications,\\" p. 80. Women as radio amateurs Amateur radio became a popular hobby in the early years of the twentieth century, and many hobbyists built their own transmitting and receiving equipment. Some of the earliest women radio amateurs, called \\"YLs,\\" were Mrs. M.J. Glass of San Jose, California, who operated as station FNFN in 1910, and Olive Heartburg, who operated as station OHK in New York City in the same year.Moreau, \\"The Feminine Touch in Telecommunications,\\" p. 82. M.S. Colville, of Bowmanville, Ontario, who began to operate as XDD in 1914, was one of the earliest Canadian YLs. The Radio Act of 1912 also required radio amateurs to be licensed. Gladys Kathleen Parkin (September 27, 1901 - August 3, 1990) was one of the earliest women to obtain a government issued license. In 1916, while a fifteen-year-old high school student at the Dominican College in San Rafael, California, she obtained a first class commercial radio operators' license with the call sign 6SO. Gladys Kathleen Parkin, 1916. Source: The Electrical Experimenter, October 1916. Parkin was quoted in an article titled \\"The Feminine Wireless Amateur,\\" which appeared in the October 1916 issue of The Electrical Experimenter: \\"With reference to my ideas about the wireless profession as a vocation or worthwhile hobby for women, I think wireless telegraphy is a most fascinating study, and one which could very easily be taken up by girls, as it is a great deal more interesting than the telephone and telegraph work, in which so many girls are now employed. I am only fifteen, and I learned the code several years ago, by practising a few minutes each day on a buzzer. I studied a good deal and I found it quite easy to obtain my first grade commercial government license, last April. It seems to me that every one should at least know the code, as cases might easily arise of a ship in distress, where the operators might be incapacitated, and a knowledge of the code might be the means of saving the ship and the lives of the passengers. But the interest in wireless does not end in the knowledge of the code. You can gradually learn to make all your own instruments, as I have done with my 1/4 kilowatt set. There is always more ahead of you, as wireless telegraphy is still in its infancy.\\" Use of the term \\"YL\\" to refer to female radio amateurs was formally adopted by the American Radio Relay League in 1920. World War I and women as radio operators Naval reservists training as wireless operators, 1916. Source: The Electrical Experimenter, October 1916. As the U.S. prepared to enter World War I, the Navy Department began a program to train women as radio operators who could be called into action in the event of war. The Girls' Division of the United States Junior Naval Reserve established training camps at the Martha Washington Post, in Edgewater, New Jersey, and the Betsy Ross Post, at Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, where young women were trained to become wireless operators. In January 1917, the National League for Women's Service (NLWS) was created from the Woman‚Äôs Department of the National Civic Federation readiness and relief activities and modelled on similar groups in Britain and elsewhere. The League was divided into thirteen national divisions, one of which was \\"Wireless and Telegraphy\\". When the US entered the war in April 1917, the NLWS established training program for female wireless operators at Hunter College in New York. Although they were not strictly government employees, these female wireless operators were allowed to transmit in order to help the war effort. Women as broadcast radio engineers Florence Violet McKenzie working with the wireless radio c1922 By 1920, the technology had evolved to the point where voice and music could be transmitted as well as Morse telegraphy, and several radio stations began to broadcast regular programs of music and news. In 1920, Eunice Randall (1898-1982), an employee of The American Radio and Research Company, or AMRAD, became an engineer and announcer for the AMRAD radio station, 1XE. Her interest in radio had begun at the age of nineteen, when she built her own amateur radio equipment and operated with the call sign 1CDP. In addition to her technical duties at 1XE, which included repairing equipment and occasionally climbing the transmitting tower, she read stories for children as \\"The Story Lady,\\" and gave the police report over the air. In 1922, the AMRAD station changed its call sign to WGI. Eunice Randall remained as engineer and assistant chief announcer until 1925, when the company went bankrupt and the station was taken off the air. However, she continued to work as an engineer and draftsman, and resumed her amateur radio activities under the call sign of W1MPP. Florence Violet Mackenzie OBE (1890‚Äì1982), Australia's first female electrical engineer, founded the Women's Emergency Signalling Corps (WESC) and trained thousands of service personnel in her Sydney signal instruction school. She later corresponded with Albert Einstein.

The vehicle had an improved V-hull to protect from underbody blasts. It had standard armor protection and could accommodate add-on armor kits. In October 2011, Lockheed announced their JLTV met standards for IED-protected vehicles in government blast tests, providing the level of protection with 40 percent less weight than currently deployed all-terrain mine-protected vehicles. Its underbody used a modified V-hull called a \\"cursive W\\"-shaped hull that was effective in dissipating blasts forward, aft, and out to the sides. The internal cab had been designed similar to that of a cockpit to make use of all available space. It was made to be ergonomic with capabilities integrated into the dashboard to free up space for the operators to be able to perform their missions. All vehicle variants were the same from the driver's seat forward. The base vehicle had no specific armament configuration, but could be fitted with a 7.62 mm or 12.7 mm machine gun. Lockheed and Moog Inc. joined to develop the Common Hellfire Package (CHP) to enable the firing of AGM-114 Hellfire missiles from various platforms. The CHP has been test fired from a stationary trailer-mounted pedestal that could be towed behind the Lockheed JLTV. The vehicle also fired Direct Attack Guided Rockets from a pedestal launcher mounted in the bed.

Although his rebellion was unsuccessful, he achieved legendary status among the island's slave population and has become part of Puerto Rican folklore. Early years It is not known when Xiorro was born or from what people and region in Africa he came from. What is known about him is that he was a Bozal slave, who had been recently brought to the Spanish colony of Puerto Rico directly from Africa. Xiorro was owned by Vicente Andino, a Militia Captain who owned a sugar plantation in the municipality of Bayam√≥n.Slave Revolts in Puerto Rico: Conspiracies and Uprisings, 1795-1873The Slave Rebellion Site False rumors of freedom In 1812, Salvador Mel√©ndez Bruna, the governor of Puerto Rico, ordered that any slave who disrespected his master would be punished with fifty lashes by the civil authorities ‚Äî and then returned to his master for additional punishment. A 100-lashes punishment was given to those who committed a violent act or incited a rebellion. Offspring of former Puerto Rican slaves in 1898, the year the United States invaded Puerto Rico Ram√≥n Power y Giralt was a Puerto Rican naval hero, a captain in the Spanish navy who had risen to become president of the Spanish Courts. Power Y Giralt was among the delegates who proposed that slavery be abolished in Puerto Rico. He sent a letter to his mother, Josefa Giralt, suggesting that if the proposals were approved, she should be the first one to grant her slaves their freedom.Slave revolt Although these proposals were never discussed in sessions of the Spanish Courts, Josefa Giralt's slaves learned about the letter and, believing that slavery had been abolished, they spread the \\"news\\" that they were free. A slave named Benito contributed to the rumor by circulating the mistaken news that the Cortes Generales y Extraordinarias de la Nacion (General and Extraordinary Courts of the Nation) had granted slaves their freedom. These false rumors led to various confrontations between the slaves, the military and the slave masters. Xiorro's conspiracy In July 1821, Xiorro planned and organized a conspiracy against the slave masters and the colonial government. This was to be carried out on July 27, during the religious festival celebrations dedicated to Santiago (St. James). Indemnity bond paid as compensation to former owners of freed slaves According to his plan, several slaves were to escape from various plantations in Bayam√≥n, which included the haciendas of Angus McBean, Cornelius Kortright, Miguel Andino and Fernando Fern√°ndez. They were to proceed to the sugarcane fields of Miguel Figueres, and retrieve cutlasses and swords which had been hidden in those fields. Xiorro, together with Mario, a slave from the McBean plantation, and another slave named Narciso, would lead the slaves from Toa Baja and together with the slaves from Bayam√≥n would capture the City of Bayam√≥n. They would burn the city and kill all the those who were Caucasians. After this, they planned to unite with slaves from the adjoining towns of R√≠o Piedras,Rio Piedras at the time was a town and not part of San Juan Guaynabo, and Palo Seco. With this critical mass of slaves, all armed and emboldened from a series of quick victories, they would invade the capital city of San Juan, where they would declare Xiorro their king. =Failure of the conspiracy= Miguel Figueres had a loyal slave named Ambrosio who told him about the plans for the rebellion. The whistleblower also had both personal and financial interests, as the colony rewarded slaves who reported any kind of slave conspiracy by granting them freedom and paying 500 pesos.Africana-Puerto Rico Figueres then informed the mayor of Bayam√≥n of the planned rebellion. The mayor proceeded to mobilize 500 soldiers for the defense of the city. They pursued the slaves, quickly capturing the ringleaders and followers of the conspiracy. A total of 61 slaves were imprisoned in Bayam√≥n and San Juan. =Aftermath= By August 15, 1821, the court trials against the conspirators were completed. A total of 17 slaves were punished, and Mario and Narciso, considered to be ringleaders, were both executed. Xiorro was captured on August 14 in the city of Mayag√ºez. He was tried separately and his fate is unknown, but he was most likely executed. The Spanish authorities believed that Jean-Pierre Boyer, the president of Haiti, which had gained independence in 1804, following a slave rebellion, contributed to Xiorro's conspiracy.\\"Historia militar de Puerto Rico\\" by: Negroni, Hector Andres; page 278; publisher: Sociedad Estatal Quinto Centenario; In the years that followed, many of the slaves who had been imprisoned and returned to their masters later escaped from their plantations. During the years of slavery there were other minor revolts. Some slaves even participated in El Grito de Lares, Puerto Rico's independence revolt against Spanish rule on September 23, 1868. On March 22, 1873, slavery was finally \\"abolished\\" in Puerto Rico but with one significant caveat: the slaves were not fully emancipated ‚Äî they had to buy their own freedom at whatever price was set by their current owners. In order to accomplish this, the majority of the freed slaves continued to work for their former masters for some time under a kind of indentured servitude. They received a salary for their labor and slowly purchased their freedom.Abolition of Slavery in Puerto Rico, Library of Congress, Retrieved July 20, 2007 The government placed a limit on this \\"buy-back\\" period and created an insular \\"Protector's Office\\" to oversee the transition. Under the new law, former slaves were to remain indentured for a maximum period of three years. After that they would go free. During that three-year period, they could work for their former masters, for other people, or for the state.La abolici√≥n de la esclavitud de 1873 en Puerto Rico Once the three-year period expired, if a slave had any remaining debt, the Protector's Office would pay it with an \\"indemnity bond\\" at the discounted value of 23% of the claimed debt. The former slaves earned money by working as shoemakers, by cleaning clothes, or by selling the produce they were allowed to grow in the small patches of land allotted to them by their former masters.\\"El Codigo Negro\\" (The Black Code). 1898 Sociedad de Amigos de la Historia de Puerto Rico , In the movies In 2007, Cine del Caribe, S.A. released a film about the slave conspiracy titled El Cimarr√≥n, starring Pedro Telemaco as Marcos Xiorro.Miguel L√≥pez Ortiz, '‚ÄúEl Cimarr√≥n‚Äù recrear√° un cap√≠tulo brutal de nuestra historia', PR Pop Further reading *Slave Revolts in Puerto Rico: Conspiracies and Uprisings, 1795-1873; by Guillermo A.

This opened the way for it to form a joint venture with Fletcher Construction of New Zealand. The second eldest brother Ram Sami Reddy started Reddy Construction Company in 1947 taking up construction of residential buildings. He was later joined by his other brother Ranga Sami Reddy. Yanktesh Permal (YP) Reddy joined the Company in 1957 and this allowed Ram Sami Reddy to move to Lautoka to open the branch in the West where there was a sudden surge of growth in the building industry. In a short time, the Company had taken up some ambitious contracts and completed projects becoming one of the local building construction companies. The younger brother, YP who had also moved to Lautoka in 1957 was soon looking at diversifying and entering into other fields of commercial activities. Besides acquiring some commercial and residential properties in Suva and the West for investment, YP in 1965 launched Reddy's Enterprises Limited to invest in tourism which was showing promise of becoming an important industry for the Fijian economy. The Group acquired a prime site in the Nadi International Airport area and built a hotel which was to become the famous Tanoa Hotel. After operating a tourist hotel as the first local operator, the company soon started acquiring other hotels. RakiRaki in 1968, Skylodge in 1973 and Nadi Travelodge in 1992. In 1987, the Tanoa Group built a new 20-room hotel in Lautoka, the Tanoa Waterfront Hotel to cater for the need of accommodation for corporate visitors to the West. The Group soon added more rooms to the Tanoa Waterfront. This was followed up with the acquisition of a hotel in central Suva which was extensively renovated and refurbished and re-opened as Tanoa Plaza which gave the Group a foothold in Suva. Reddy Construction went into joint venture with Parkinson's UK Group to undertake construction of the prestigious, Lautoka Government Hospital. Soon after that it went into joint venture with Fletcher Construction of New Zealand to take up even more ambitious construction projects amongst which were the University of the South Pacific building extensions, ANZ Bank complex in Suva, Lautoka and Suva Wharves, Sugar Mill boilers installation and the Sheraton Hotel in Denarau. After the 1987 Military Coup and the death of his two brothers, Ram Sami in 1985 and Ranga Sami in 1988, YP decided to downsize activities in the construction field and concentrate on Hotels and Real Estate investments. The Reddy Group in 1970 took up shares in Clyde Engineering Co Ltd, a NZ company which expanded its operations in Fiji to market and service heavy construction and industrial equipment in the South Pacific. In 1983, the Group acquired 100% share holding in Clyde. In its programme of diversification Clyde acquired the scaffolding hire business of Boral Acrow, an Australian Company in 2001 and Nacap Hire in 2006. Recently the Group has entered into the financial services sector in Fiji.

Located between the Fox River and the Wisconsin River, the site contains two historic buildings: the \\"surgeon's quarters\\" and Garrison School. The \\"surgeon's quarters\\", built circa 1819 by portage Francs LeRoi and sold to the US Army in 1828 and used as a sutler store and then as a home for the Fort surgeon. Garrison School was built circa 1850 on the former Fort property. Both properties are owned, operated, and maintained by the Wisconsin Society Daughters of the American Revolution, which operates it as a historic house museum with 19th century period furnishings and fort artifacts. History \\"The Portage\\" was a land bridge just 1 1/4 miles wide separating waterways that flow into the Atlantic Ocean to the east and the Gulf of Mexico to the south. The Fox River flows north toward Green Bay, providing access to the Great Lakes, the St. Lawrence River, and the Atlantic Ocean. The Wisconsin River flows southwest to the Mississippi River, which empties into the Gulf of Mexico. The area around Portage was an early travel route for Native Americans. Centuries before the white men arrived, they traversed the 2700-pace footpath between the rivers and recognized it as an important travel route. In the early 1800s, the U.S. government recognized the geographical importance of \\"le Portage\\", which became known as \\"Portage\\". Fort Winnebago was one of three forts built to protect settlers and commerce along the Fox- Wisconsin water system in the territory that later became the state of Wisconsin. The other two were Fort Howard in Green Bay and Fort Crawford, in Prairie du Chien. > \\"By Command of Maj.-Gen. Macomb\\" > \\"R. Jones, Adjt.-Gen.\\" > \\"here was necessity for some means of protection to the fur trade from > Winnebago (Ho-Chunk) exactions; ... the general government at the > solicitation of John Jacob Astor, who was then at the head of the American > Fur Company, and upon whose goods the Indians levied exorbitant tolls, > authorized the erection of a post at portage.\\" The building now known as \\"the Surgeons Quarters\\" was built in 1824 by Francois Le Roi and Therese L'Ecuyer, a M√©tis. In it, they operated a fur trading and sutler's post and a portaging business. It is one of the oldest French colonial log homes in Wisconsin still standing on its original foundation and is the only remaining building of the historic Fort Winnebago, which was active from 1828 through 1845. During the War of 1812, the British ventured into the territory in an attempt to reclaim this important waterway. Soldiers arrived to build Fort Winnebago in 1828. The log house was used by the United States Army as a surgeon's quarters for the fort and as an officers' residence. In 1845, the garrison left the fort, ordered west to protect the frontier. Garrison School, a 19th-century one room schoolhouse that was in use until 1960, was moved from its former location to its current site next to the surgeon's quarters.

During his life, he was apparently the only living teacher representing Caodong/S≈çt≈ç school, and he was the last monk of that tradition to be mentioned in the influential Transmission of the Lamp, compiled in 1004. However, as that work was compiled during his lifetime, it lacked biographical information. A biography did not appear until the Xudeng lu of 1101. He left his birth city to become a monk at Chongxiao Temple in Jinling. His teacher there was named Zhitong, but Dayang soon left when he was 19. He studied with Yuanjiao Liaoyi for a time, but eventually moved on, finally settling on Liangshan Yuanguan as his teacher. Dayang Jingxuan is an important figure in the Caodong/S≈çt≈ç Zen lineage because he was apparently the only remaining representative of the Caodong/S≈çt≈ç tradition during his lifetime. Furthermore, he is significant because the lineage effectively died out with him, but through highly unusual means, the lineage was passed on to someone he had never met. Juefan Huihong's biographical compilation of 1119, the Chanlin sengbao zhuan (Chronicle of the Sangha Treasure in the Groves of Chan), suggests that Touzi Yiqing was the \\"true son\\", or student, of Dayang. The Xudeng lu of 1101 lists Touzi and nine others as disciples of Dayang. However, it explains that Touzi did not actually receive dharma transmission from Dayang, but from Fushan Fayuan. Fushan had been a student of Dayang, but he himself had not received dharma transmission from Dayang either. The scholar Morten Schl√ºtter notes that this form of lineage transfer \\"has no real parallel in early Chan literature\\". This refers to the fact that Touzi was able to be considered the immediate heir to Dayang's lineage without having met him, and that Fayuan was able to hold Dayang's lineage \\"in trust\\" without actually being a bona fide heir. Schl√ºtter further interprets Huihong's likely embellished account as an attempt to strengthen the rather weak link between Touzi and the last Caodong monk recorded in the Transmission of the Lamp in order to solidify the legitimacy of the lineage.

He then became an anarchist, volunteering in the International Brigades, before changing sides and enlisting in the Frankreich Brigade and later in the 33rd Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Charlemagne. When he came back to France, he was sentenced (in 1948 in Lyon) to one year of jail for his commitment. About this period of his life, he will later on disavow the leader principle without ever renouncing racialism: \\"So hang on to your French, European and White conscience and be if you can a part of our race, of our blood, of our soul that shall live on when all around us will fall apart\\". A pioneer of ecology in France with his periodical L'Or Vert (The Green Gold), he also wrote in identitarian publications such as the extreme right R√©fl√©chir & Agir to condemn modern society drawing inspiration from neoheathenism, ecology, myths and traditions. He furthermore created the \\"Europo\\", a language that he hoped could be used for European integration.

He is the father of songstress Melly Goeslaw. His song, \\"Pergi untuk Kembali\\", was chosen by Rolling Stone Indonesia as the 117th-best Indonesian song of all time in 2009. Biography =Early life and musical career= Melky Goeslaw was born in Morotai, an island off Halmahera in the Maluku Islands, on 7 May 1947. He became active in music in 1964, when he joined the band Octa Nada; he later joined the bands Nada Anda and Nada Buana. He also toured with Bob Tutupoly and sang rock songs at various nightclubs during the early 1970s; during this period, he participated diligently in song festivals. In 1974, Goeslaw was a finalist in the National Popular Song Festival (); the following year, after placing third in the Jakarta-level festival, Goeslaw rose to fame by winning the National Popular Song Festival with the song \\"Pergi untuk Kembali\\" (\\"Leave to Return\\"), beating other singers such as Berlian Hutauruk (fourth) and professional singer Hetty Koes Endang (fifth); he was immediately put on the same level of popularity as established singers such as Broery and Hetty Koes Endang. In 1977, pairing with Diana Nasution, Goeslaw came in second place at the National Singers Festival (). The two, wearing black outfits and white highlights in their hair, sang the song \\"Bila Cengkeh Berbunga\\" (\\"If the Cloves Blossom\\"), by Nasution's husband Mingoes Tahitu. They came in closely behind Hetty Koes Endang but ahead of Ira Puspita, who performed while three months pregnant; despite coming in second, the pair were the Indonesian magazine Tempo choice for best performance of the festival. Two years later, during an increase in the popularity of dangdut music, Goeslaw attempted to record some dangdut songs. However, he found it more difficult than pop and rock; one of his considerations was that the vocals were similar in nature to the Islamic qasida - as a Protestant, Goeslaw felt it was against his religion. Most of his hit singles, such as \\"Hiroshima dan Nagasaki\\" (\\"Hiroshima and Nagasaki\\"), \\"Tuhan Semesta Alam\\" (\\"God of the Natural Universe\\"), and \\"Dansa Yo Dansa\\" (\\"Dance, Yeah Dance\\"), were either pop or rock. =Boxing manager, declining health, and death= In 1987, together with fellow musician Enteng Tanamal, Goeslaw became the manager of former International Boxing Federation champion Ellyas Pical. Pical chose Goeslaw after having a falling out with former managers Simson Tambunan dan Anton Sihotang, and short-term managers Dali Sofari dan Khairus Sahel. For his part, Goeslaw was glad that he could manage Pical, immediately choosing Wiem Gomies to be Pical's trainer. In 1989, Goeslaw suffered from a heart attack. As a result, he cut back on his smoking and drinking and began attending church more often. In 1995 he won the Kawakami Prize for his life's work. Goeslaw was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2004. According to his daughter Ully, he also suffered from trouble with his lungs; he was also reported to have diabetes and a heart condition. He died in Jakarta at 16:00 local time (UTC+7) on 20 December 2006 while waiting for an ambulance from MMC Hospital in Kuningan, South Jakarta, after collapsing at his home in Petukangan Utara. He is buried at Tanah Kusir cemetery next to his son, Tansa. According to Sorta Tobing, a reporter for Tempo, Goeslaw's death led to a greater public interest in male breast cancer in Indonesia. Accolades and legacy In their December 2009 issue, Rolling Stone Indonesia listed \\"Pergi untuk Kembali\\" (\\"Leave to Return\\"), written by Mingoes Tahitu and sung by Goeslaw, as the 117th-best Indonesian song of all time. Personal life Goeslaw was married four times. With one of his wives, whom he later divorced, he had Melly Goeslaw. Goeslaw was a Protestant.

The Hawkei is a highly mobile, highly protected, 7-tonne vehicle, with in-built systems to allow it to be used as a fighting platform. It has been developed with Vehicle Electronic Architecture to be mission system ready. It is intended to undertake a range of mission profiles, including troop movement, command and control, electronic warfare, liaison, surveillance and reconnaissance. Prime contractors include: Thales Australia, Boeing Australia, Plasan (Israel) and PAC Group. In October 2015, the Australian Government announced the purchase of 1,100 Hawkei vehicles from Thales Australia. History As part of a wider project to replace the ADF's fleet of operational support vehicles, Project Land 121 Phase 4 ‚Äì Protected Mobility Vehicle (Light) or PMV-L, is a requirement for up to 1,300 specialised light armoured vehicles replace some of the in-service Land Rovers. Key criteria for the project included: off-road mobility, integrated vehicle electronic architecture, substantial payloads, high levels of protection against land mines, improvised explosive devices and ballistic weapons while being light enough to be air transported by military helicopters. The three options considered as part of the project were: *Option 1, Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) Program - align the PMV-L requirement to the United States JLTV program to replace its fleet of High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle or 'Humvee' (awarded 25 August 2015 to Oshkosh offering L-ATV); *Option 2, Manufactured and Supported in Australia (MSA); and *Option 3, Market available ‚Äì pursuit of this option is subject to Australian Government decisions on Options 1 and 2. Competitors for the MSA option included the combat proven MOWAG Eagle IV from General Dynamics Land Systems; the British military then selected Ocelot from Force Protection; and the Hawkei offering from Thales Australia. The JTLV option included entries from BAE Systems/Navistar, AM General/General Dynamics and Lockheed Martin. In December 2011 the Australian Department of Defence announced Hawkei as the preferred vehicle for further development and testing under the MSA option. In October 2015, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Minister for Defence Marise Payne announced the purchase of 1,100 Hawkei vehicles and 1,000 trailers at a cost of $1.3 billion. In November 2017 it was reported that the Hawkei was being considered by Poland as part of a modernisation of the country's military. This could result in an initial purchase of 50 vehicles, and as many as 700 over the long term. In September 2020, the Hawkei was announced as one of four vehicles to qualify for the Polish competition. In September 2018 the Australian National Audit Office released a report which criticised aspects of the Hawkei project. The report judged that Australia should have remained in the JLTV program to provide competition for the Hawkei procurement and that the Department of Defence had not kept ministers fully informed about the Hawkei program. This included not providing ministers with a study which found that there were few benefits from building the vehicles in Australia. The ANAO was unable to publish some elements of the audit after Attorney General Christian Porter ruled that publishing it would compromise national security. Thales had taken legal action earlier in the year seeking to have material removed from the report. As of December 2018, the Hawkei is facing reliability issues following a demonstration test conducted on 19 November 2018, delaying full-rate production. In September 2020, Defence Minister Linda Reynolds and Defence Industry Minister Melissa Price confirmed the Hawkei was ready to enter full- rate production at Thales‚Äô Protected Vehicles facility in Bendigo, Victoria at the rate of approximately 50 vehicles per month. 1,100 Hawkei vehicles and 1,058 associated trailers will be delivered. Variants All variants use the same four wheeled platform. =Command= Dual cab manned by a crew of four to six, weapons system options including up to 12.7mm guns or 40mm grenade systems in various mounts with a remote operated option. =Border Protection= Dual cab manned by a crew of four to six, various equipment options including force protection radar, surveillance and communications systems. =Special Operations Vehicle= Dual cab manned by a crew of four to six with up to three weapon systems: * Front co-driver swing mount; * Roof mounted manual gunring or remote weapon station; and/or * Rear-facing swing mount. =Utility= A Hawkei utility variant in 2016 Single-extended cab with a flat-bed cargo area measuring; L: x W: .

Born in the Northland region of New Zealand in 1865, Meldrum studied law after completing his schooling. A talented sportsman, he played representative rugby and cricket for Auckland. He was a barrister and solicitor practicing in Auckland initially before moving south to the Rangitikei District. He continued to work in the legal profession but also took up farming and was involved in local body politics. He was also prominent in the local militia, establishing a unit of mounted rifle volunteers. During the First World War, he volunteered for service with the New Zealand Expeditionary Force and commanded the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment during the Gallipoli Campaign and the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. By late 1917, he was a brigadier-general and commander of the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade. Returning to New Zealand after the war, he resumed practicing law. He later moved to Greymouth where he became the local magistrate and also served as the town's mayor. He died at Burnham Camp in 1964 at age of 98. Early life Born in Whangarei, Northland, in New Zealand, Meldrum was the son of a farmer and his wife. As well as attending Kamo School, he was educated in Scotland. After completing his schooling at Auckland College and Grammar School, he studied law at Auckland University College. He participated in sports, representing Auckland in rugby in 1886 and also in four first-class cricket matches between 1884 and 1887. He played chess to a high standard and would be the New Zealand Chess Champion in 1896. After completing his legal studies, Meldrum worked at the prominent law firm Whitaker and Russell and eventually became a barrister and solicitor in 1889. Two years later he moved to Hunterville, a town in the Rangitikei District and had a legal practice there for several years. He was prominent in local affairs, being on the Hunterville Town Board for a period and he was an unsuccessful candidate in the 1909 Rangitikei by-election, where he came third in the first ballot. In 1912, he sold his practice and from the profits brought land in the area which he farmed together with his wife, Nora, who he had married in 1894. The couple had two children. First World War On the outbreak of the First World War, Meldrum volunteered for the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) being raised for service overseas. He had extensive military service; he had formed a militia unit, the Hunterville Mounted Rifle Volunteers, in 1900 and by 1914 had risen to command of 6th (Manawatu) Mounted Rifles Regiment, with the rank of lieutenant colonel in the New Zealand Territorial Force. He would eventually be awarded the Colonial Auxiliary Forces Officers' Decoration for his lengthy service in the Territorial Force. In the NZEF, Meldrum was appointed commander of the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment (WMR), which included three squadrons of mounted infantry from the three mounted regiments of the central North Island. After departing for the Middle East, Meldrum oversaw the training of his command until it was called upon for service in the Gallipoli Campaign as part of the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, landing at ANZAC Cove on 12 May 1915. His men soon gave him the nickname 'Fix-Bayonets Bill' also 'Corncob Bill' but despite this he demonstrated awareness of the value of the lives under his command. He refused orders to mount a frontal attack on Turkish machine guns on one occasion and sought a retreat from vulnerable positions on another. A competent commander, Meldrum's WMR played an important role in the Battle of Chunuk Bair, when it captured Destroyer Hill and Table Top features, on the approaches to Chunuk Bair, in the evening of 6 August 1915. It then reinforced the defenders of Chunuk Bair in the evening of 8 August. Later that day Meldrum had to take overall command of the defending forces when the senior officer present was wounded. The WMR was relieved the next day, with 100 out of 183 men killed or wounded. Towards the end of the campaign, he was called up to take over command of the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade. He was later recognised for his leadership during the battle with an appointment as a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George and by the end of the campaign in Gallipoli had twice been mentioned in despatches. After the evacuation from Gallipoli, and following a period of recuperation in Egypt, the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, with Meldrum having reverted to command of the WMR, was made part of the ANZAC Mounted Division. While the rest of the NZEF went to Europe for service on the Western Front, the ANZAC Mounted Division remained in the Middle East and served in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign, part of the efforts involved in protecting the Suez Canal from Turkish attacks. At one stage in 1916, Meldrum was called up to temporarily lead the Australian 2nd Light Horse Brigade when its original commanding officer was wounded. Later that year, the WMR was heavily involved in the Battle of Rafa. In January 1917, he was appointed to the Distinguished Service Order for his services the previous year and the following month he was gazetted as a recipient of the Serbian Order of the White Eagle with Swords for his services at Gallipoli. Meldrum led his regiment during the First Battle of Gaza, getting as far as the perimeter of Gaza itself. In the followup Second Battle of Gaza, the WMR did even better. After the battle, Meldrum was promoted to brigadier general and made commander of the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade. He led the brigade in the Battle of Ayun Kara and the First Attack on Amman. He also co-ordinated the various units of the brigade well in the Battle of Beersheba. After the war, he was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath in recognition of his services in Egypt and Palestine. He had also been mentioned in despatches a further two times. Later life On returning to New Zealand, Meldrum took up practicing law in New Plymouth. His farms, unprofitable because of the low wool prices, were sold and he also separated from his wife. In 1921, he moved to the town of Greymouth where he was the magistrate for several years. In 1927, having secured a divorce, he remarried. With his second wife, Clare Dobson, he had two daughters and a son. He served as Mayor of Greymouth from 1935 to 1938. During the Second World War, he was involved in the Home Guard for the Greymouth and Westport area and for two years, from 1942 to 1944, chaired the Armed Forces Appeal Board. His second son joined the New Zealand Army and it was during a visit to see him at Burnham Camp that Meldrum died, on 13 February 1964. He was survived by four children and his second wife.

Phelan and Bruce G. Link developed the theory of fundamental causes. This theory seeks to outline why the association between socioeconomic status (SES) and health disparities has persisted over time, particularly when diseases and conditions previously thought to cause morbidity and mortality among low SES individuals have resolved. The theory states that an ongoing association exists between SES and health status because SES \\"embodies an array of resources, such as money, knowledge, prestige, power, and beneficial social connections that protect health no matter what mechanisms are relevant at any given time.\\" In other words, despite advances in screening techniques, vaccinations, or any other piece of health technology or knowledge, the underlying fact is that those from low SES communities lack resources to protect and/or improve their health.  Key components  According to Link and Phelan, a fundamental social cause of health inequalities has four key components: # The cause influences multiple disease outcomes # The cause affects disease outcomes through multiple risk factors. # The cause involves access to resources that can assist in avoiding health risks or to minimize the sequelae of disease once it occurs. # \\"The association between a fundamental cause and health is reproduced over time via the replacement of intervening mechanisms\\" By these criteria, SES is a fundamental cause for healthcare disparities. Previous school of thought on health disparities In the 19th century, the major causes of mortality were typically infectious diseases, as well as diseases that resulted from poor sanitation and crowded living conditions. In 1900, the top three causes of death were pneumonia, tuberculosis, and diarrhea.Gordis, L. Epidemiology, Elsevier-Sanders, Philadelphia, 4th Ed., 2008. These conditions have been largely eradicated thanks to the development of antibiotics, vaccinations, sewage management systems, and improved education regarding sanitation and food handling. Because lower SES individuals were more likely to live in crowded, unsanitary conditions, it was thought that the improvement of these conditions would lead to an improvement in health. However, disparities in healthcare and health outcomes have persisted. Health has been linked to social class dating back to the early 19th century, when the French tracked mortality in connection with areas of poverty. Similarly, the English began documenting mortality by occupation in the mid-1800s. In the United States, more attention was paid to racial connections to health disparities up until 1973, when Evelyn M. Kitagawa and Philip Hauser published a report connecting SES to increased morbidity and mortality.Kitagawa, E. M., and P. M. Hauser. 1973. Differential Mortality in the United States: A Study in Socioeconomic Epidemiology. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Universitv Press. The role of resources Link and Phelan state that the key resources that lower SES individuals lack include knowledge, money, power, prestige, and beneficial social connections. At a given SES level, this lack of resources persists despite what other factors, beneficial or not so, are at play. =Knowledge= Knowledge primarily includes health literacy, but may also involve the knowledge that is gained via access to physicians and the medical establishment. Health literacy can be defined as \\"the knowledge and competencies of persons to meet the complex demands of health in society.\\"http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1471-2458-12-80.pdf While previously health literacy was defined as the ability to read materials in a medical context, the definition has evolved to include more than simply the ability to read. It now encompasses a broad range of skills and activities that decrease the asymmetry of information in the health care marketplace. =Money= The relationship between money and health is linear with a positive slope; that is, the more money a person has, the better their health, with some exceptions.Herd, P., Goesling, B., and House, J.S. 2007. Socioeconomic Position and Health. American Sociological Association. 48:223-238. At a basic level, income enables people to access and pay for health care when it is necessary or to purchase health insurance. Beyond this, money also provides the ability to fund healthy choices, including purchasing nutritious food, a gym membership, and medications. On an even larger scale, it provides the ability to make adaptations to the work or residential environment, e.g., changing jobs, relocating to a safer neighborhood, or retiring from work at the time of one's choosing. Each of these factors demonstrate that finances play a key role in health decisions and overall health. =Power and prestige= In the context of health care and access, power is the ability to exert one's influence to effect change on the behalf of oneself or others. Prestige is the \\"reputation or influence arising from success, achievement, rank, or other favorable attributes.\\" Power and prestige are factors in determining a person's place in the social hierarchy, and they manifest themselves in multiple ways. One is power and prestige in the workplace. Those with power in their jobs are able to take days off of work for leisure or to access medical care. According to the Whitehall Studies, a gradient was observed across all levels of employment, with those wielding the greatest amount of power in their jobs having the lowest mortality levels. Another example of the use of power and prestige is the ability to exert political power. Specifically, \\"electoral engagement is positively correlated with income at the individual level.\\"http://www.cses.org/plancom/2009Toronto/CSES_2009Toronto_JaimeCastillo.pdf This demonstrates that those who are of lower socio-economic status are at a disadvantage in terms of the political clout that they possess. Because lower- income individuals are less likely to vote for representatives and for other ballot measures, the policies and laws put into place may not serve their interests. =Beneficial social connections= Social connections can be conceptualized in two ways: one, connections between unrelated social worlds, and, two, social relations within relatively closed worlds.Bartkus, V.O., Davis, J.H. (2010). Social Capital: Reaching Out, Reaching In. Edward Elgar Publishing. Those of lower SES may lack the first type more than the second, which places them at a more significant disadvantage in terms of their health status. Someone from a higher-SES group may have friends or colleagues who are health care providers, attorneys, or politicians. Through these social connections, broader networks can be accessed that may provide health benefits. Conversely, some lower-SES individuals, specifically Latinos, benefit from strong community relationships. This has been referred to as the Barrio Effect, which states that Mexican-Americans living in areas with high densities of Mexicans experience \\"sociocultural advantages\\" that \\"outweigh the disadvantages conferred by the high poverty of those neighborhoods.\\" Intervening mechanisms A final key part of the theory is the persistence of resource disparities that perpetuate unequal health outcomes, despite intervening mechanisms that may otherwise appear to improve health status. An example of this is the Pap smear for cervical cancer screening. Since the development of the Pap smear in the 1940s, a disparity has existed in utilization of this screening test given differences in resources mentioned above. Another example is the polio vaccine. Prior to the vaccine, polio could afflict people of all socioeconomic classes. Once the vaccine became available, it was primarily accessible by those who possessed the resources to obtain it. We also see an example of this in colorectal cancer, in which the variable diffusion has role in the theory; in which diffusion has reduced mortality, but not enough to eliminiate SES inequalities as seen in Wang et al. 2012. These examples demonstrate how intervening mechanisms, e.g., the Pap smear and the polio vaccine, did not decrease health disparities given that certain groups possessed resources to access them and others did not.

Biography =Early life and career= She was born Ann McLachlan in Kilmartin, Argyllshire, Scotland, on 4 November 1862. She attended a state school in Kilmartin and later trained as a nurse in Glasgow. In 1888 she married Gordon McDonald, with whom she sailed to New Zealand in 1901. Gordon died in 1906 and on 9 October that same year she re-married to Alexander McVicar, a widower with three children. From 1906 McVicar was actively engaged in both teaching and social work in Wellington. She was an early member, and later vice president, of the New Zealand Society for the Protection of Women and Children and also established the local branch of the Plunket Society in 1908, which she was also the secretary of. She frequently accompanied Plunket nurses on visits to mothers and on occasion carried out these duties by herself. =Political career= Ballot papers listing Annie McVicar McVicar was also interested in politics. In 1913 she was the vice president of the Wellington women's branch of the Reform Party. She was one of four candidates in the in the and came last, with 4% of the vote. She later served on the Worser Bay School committee and was chairperson of the ladies' advisory committee of Wellington Technical College from 1923 to 1949. She was elected to the Wellington Hospital Board in 1915 and served on the body continuously until her retirement in 1938. From 1919 she was involved in distributing funds to improve conditions in maternity homes, after a large sum of money was left to the Hospital Board. In local government, as in her other activities, McVicar was known to be energetic and pragmatic, particularly when focused on her specific interests which were the education and welfare of women and children. She was then elected to the Miramar Borough Council in 1919. In 1921 Miramar amalgamated with Wellington, and she became the first woman elected to the Wellington City Council, on a Civic League ticket. An editorial in the Evening Post declared: \\"Never before has Wellington had a lady City Councillor, and the innovation is full of promise.\\" She was re- elected in 1923, but was defeated in 1925. =Later life and death= In 1926 McVicar was appointed a justice of the peace, one of the first women in New Zealand to be given the office.

Early life and career A view of the nationalist Ardoyne area of north Belfast where Brown spent the early years of her life Brown was born in about 1945 in Belfast, Northern Ireland. She was brought up in the Irish nationalist Ardoyne area and raised in the Catholic religion. She later moved to west Belfast.Wood, Ian S. (2006). Crimes of Loyalty: A History of the UDA. Edinburgh University Press. pp.135-136 When her marriage broke up, her husband left her with seven children to raise on her own. At one time she worked in a shirt factory alongside Protestants, which was relatively unusual in Belfast where Catholics and Protestants were typically segregated in the workplace as well as living in their own neighbourhoods and attending separate schools. Described as slim, blonde, immaculately groomed and petite,McGartland, Martin (2009). Fifty Dead Men Walking.

IRA Intelligence Officer The Sinn F√©in offices in Belfast. Brown was a former worker for Sinn F√©in She joined the Irish republican movement in 1970 as a worker for Sinn F√©in, the political wing of the IRA. It is not known exactly when she joined the Provisional IRA, but in 1971 she was forced to go on the run and spent six years hiding in Dublin. After returning to Northern Ireland, she was arrested in 1978 for IRA activity and sent to Armagh Women's Prison for a brief period. Sometime after her release from Armagh she became an IRA Intelligence Officer, and later received the nickname of the \\"IRA Mata Hari\\" by the media. She was described by journalist Mark Devenport as having been especially suited for intelligence work; in particular she was highly skilled at losing herself when members of the security forces were tailing her. She often used the Irish version of her name, R√≥is√≠n De Br√∫n. According to journalist Liam Clarke, Brown used a mixture of \\"blackmail, political argument and seduction\\" to inveigle John Hanna, a senior officer at the Maze Prison, into providing her with information on top loyalists and prison officer colleagues, which she then passed on to the IRA. This form of espionage is known as a \\"honey trap\\".\\"Claims of Provo infiltration of police are supported\\". Belfast Telegraph. Liam Clarke. 23 December 2011 Retrieved 1 February 2012 The Belfast Telegraph newspaper described Brown as \\"one of the most famous 'honeys'\\". When she was with Hanna she used the name \\"Ann Brown\\".Devenport, p.74 Ulster Defence Association (UDA) leader Andy Tyrie suggested that Hanna gave Brown information regarding the movements of UDA South Belfast brigadier John McMichael which she then passed on to the IRA who subsequently assassinated him. Hanna, who was completely infatuated with Brown and later admitted that he was dominated by \\"a Provie woman\\",Geraghty, Tony (1998). The Irish WAR: the hidden conflict between the IRA and British Intelligence. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press. p.97 obtained the information regarding McMichael during the latter's visits to loyalist inmates inside the Maze. Brown was personally introduced to McMichael at his pub the \\"Admiral Benbow\\" which he owned in his native Lisburn. She warned him that he was \\"being watched\\".\\"Set up for murder?\\". The News Letter. 21 December 2007 John McMichael was killed on 22 December 1987 when a booby-trap bomb exploded underneath his car in his driveway. The IRA unit which planted the bomb was led by Se√°n Savage, who would later be gunned down by the SAS in Gibraltar in what became known as Operation Flavius.Wood, p.128 Neither Hanna nor Brown were ever charged with involvement in McMichael's murder. It is widely believed that he was set up by his UDA associates. Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) Chief Constable Sir John Hermon also suggested that this was the case.Coogan, Tim Pat (1995).

New York: Palgrave. pp.338-339 Racketeer and UDA \\"fundraiser\\" James Craig was shot dead inside an east Belfast pub by the Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF) for allegedly setting up McMichael's assassination by the IRA.Dillon, Martin (1989). The Shankill Butchers: the real story of cold-blooded mass murder. New York: Routledge. pp.264-266 Brown's importance to the IRA as an Intelligence Officer is revealed by Martin McGartland in his memoirs. McGartland, an RUC Special Branch agent who infiltrated the IRA, alleged that he was ordered by both his IRA commander and his handlers to work with Brown. He characterised her as having been \\"very well-spoken and pleasant to deal with\\", but firmly denied that they had had a love affair. He stated that in early 1990, she took a package wrapped in clingfilm out of her mouth and told him to deliver it to another IRA Intelligence Officer, Davy Adams (nephew of Sinn F√©in president Gerry Adams). Inside the package was a list containing the names, addresses, postcodes, and car registration numbers of RUC officers, which had been copied from a police database. McCartland's handlers suggested that the highly detailed information had come from an RUC officer with whom Brown had formed a liaison. In that same year, 1990, Hanna was sentenced to life imprisonment for aiding and abetting the IRA in the murder of his colleague, Brian Samuel Armour, vice-chairman of the Prison Officers' Association. Armour was killed by a booby-trap bomb on 4 October 1988 as he drove through Bloomfield in Belfast. Hanna allegedly provided Brown with Armour's address which enabled the IRA to plant the bomb underneath his car. Brown was named at Hanna's trial as the conduit through which the information on Armour was passed by Hanna to the IRA. She was taken in by the RUC for interrogation regarding the Armour killing whilst she was shooting Hush-a-Bye-Baby, a feature film for Channel Four. Rod Stoneman, Commissioning Editor at Channel Four, phoned the RUC protesting that her arrest was holding up production. A Special Branch policeman reportedly replied, \\"Well, it may not have occurred to you, but we are fighting a war here\\".Stoneman, Rod (2010). Chance and Change. article published by Wayne State University Press. p.15 She wasn't charged in connection with Armour's killing and subsequently released from police custody. Although it was believed by the RUC and media that Brown had sex with Hanna in order to obtain the information she needed, both she and Hanna adamantly maintained that during their encounters they never had a \\"full sexual relationship\\". According to McGartland, she and Hanna often met in lay- bys or the cemetery where his parents were buried.McGartland, p.194 After the details of her involvement with Hanna became known to the public, Brown ensconced herself in staunch republican areas of north and west Belfast. According to Devenport, she became romantically involved with IRA associate Davy Adams during this period. =Arrest and imprisonment= The seaport of Larne, County Antrim where Brown was arrested by the RUC in 1992 In early 1992, Brown was arrested in the seaport of Larne along with IRA volunteers Paul McCullough and Steven Canning, when a booby-trap bomb was discovered in the glove box of their car. She had been driving the car towards the town when RUC officers stopped the vehicle, ordered her to pull over and all three occupants out onto a verge. As she took off her woollen cap, the ginger wig she had been wearing as a disguise slipped off, therefore revealing her identity. The RUC then found the bomb inside the car.Devenport, Mark (2000). Flash Frames: twelve years reporting Belfast. Blackstaff Press. p.72 On 10 September 1993, she was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment at Mourne House, the women's unit of HM Maghaberry for illegal possession of explosives and conspiracy to murder members of the security forces. The arrest of Brown led to some recriminations within loyalist circles.

He edited and authored the three-volume Encyclopaedia of New Zealand, published in 1966, his final and perhaps his most remembered work. Early life Born in Gore, New Zealand, on 14 April 1903, Alexander Hare McLintock was the son of a Scotsman, Robert McLintock, an engineer by trade, and his wife Christina . He attended Caversham School in Dunedin and then Otago Boy's High. After completing his education, he decided to become a teacher and went to Dunedin Training College. He then worked for several years at a primary school while studying history at the University of Otago. Academia While at university, McLintock became well known as a debater, representing Otago at competitions overseas. He became a proficient speed reader and developed wide interests including classics and the piano. As well as attending university, he went to the Dunedin School of Art and studied painting and etching. McLintock graduated in 1928 having obtained a master's degree with first class honours. The same year, he married Eva Maude . McLintock began working at Timaru Technical College in 1929 and continued to do so until 1936 at which time he went to London, where he began studying for his doctorate degree. While at Timaru, he also lectured at the Workers' Educational Association for a time. He completed his degree in 1939 and two years later, published The Establishment of Constitutional Government in Newfoundland, 1783‚Äì1832, a book based on his thesis. By this stage, he had become well known in the New Zealand art scene with his writings on the subject and his own paintings and etchings. In 1939, on his return to New Zealand, he became director of the National Centennial Exhibition of New Zealand Art, held in 1940. Historian Returning to the University of Otago in 1940 as a history lecturer, he became involved in the Otago Centennial Historical Publications as editor. This work included McLintock writing two books in the series. One of these was the well regarded The History of Otago, published in 1949 and which won the Ernest Scott Prize from the University of Melbourne. The same year, an opportunity arose to secure the chair of history at Canterbury University College; however, much to his disappointment he missed out and thereafter held a disregard for the academic establishment. In 1952, he finished lecturing at Otago, having switched subjects to English a few years previously, and took a post as parliamentary historian. In his new role, McLintock worked on what was intended to be several volumes of a parliamentary history. The first of these, Crown Colony Government in New Zealand, was published in 1958. Rather than continue with the next planned volume, a work on the early years of the Legislative Council, he turned to editing work; A Descriptive Atlas of New Zealand was produced in 1959. In the 1963 New Year Honours, McLintock was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire. He then took on what was most likely his best known work, the task of co-ordinating and editing the Encyclopaedia of New Zealand. This was a three-volume series of books with in excess of 1,800 entries produced by over three hundred authors. McLintock also wrote several entries across a range of subjects. The encyclopedia was published in November 1966, selling its entire print run of 34,000 copies within months. McLintock was involved in other work; paintings and etchings were exhibited in Europe, including at the Royal Academy of Arts. He was also on the committee for New Zealand banknotes when it switched to decimal currency. Afflicted by cancer, McLintock retired in early 1968. He died a few months later, on 29 May 1968, in Dunedin. He was survived by his wife, who he had cared for since she suffered a stroke several years previously, and a daughter.

Moving from Scotland to Australia as a child, and to New Zealand as an adult, he rose from a working class shepherd, to sheep rancher and a rich land holder. In his seventies, McLean built 'Holly Lea' in Christchurch, which was renamed McLean's Mansion. After his death, the building served as the McLean Institute through an act of parliament. Early life He was born on Coll, one of the islands of the Inner Hebrides of Scotland, and baptised on 24 May 1822. His father, Alexander McLean, was a farmer and fisherman who lived on Lagmor, where he drowned in 1836. Initially, the family was sustained by the large tracts of land they owned on the Isles of Tiree and Mull as well as on the mainland at Mowern and Ardnamurchan. But over the years, they needed additional resources to make a livelihood and resorted to fisheries. After his father's death, his mother, Mary, could not make a living with the lands left to her and they were in a penurious state. Mary took the five surviving of her eight children to Australia in 1840 after widespread crop failure. Allan McLean and his brothers John and Robertson made a living as working class shepherds, and became established enough so that they could buy two sheep runs in west Victoria, which they owned from 1848 to 1851. They capitalised on the Victorian gold rush by supplying the goldfields region, becoming runholders. Life in New Zealand McLean's Mansion in May 2011 In 1852, the brothers purchased the Ashfield run adjacent to the Waimakariri River in Canterbury, New Zealand, and the family moved to that country. Robertson returned to Scotland but Allan and John owned runs in Canterbury, Otago, and Morven Hills, acquiring the Waikakahi property near Waimate from a Mr. Harris in 1866. Their sister Alexandrina had married George Buckley in 1860, and Buckley became a shareholder in the Waikakahi run, but sold out to the brothers in 1875. Eventually, Allan and John's partnership ended. By 1882, his properties had a value of 200,000 pounds. In 1895, he owned 69,000 sheep, and his horse teams ploughed . He lived at 'the Valley', a homestead surrounded by gardens. McLean's land was bought by the Liberal Government in 1899 as part of their policy of breaking up large land holdings. McLean was distressed by the forced sale of his land to the extent that he never returned to the district. For the government, it was the second largest purchase in Canterbury; the largest purchase was the estate of William Robinson around Cheviot. McLean retired to Christchurch, where he had a house of enormous dimensions built in a fusion of Jacobean and Victorian style for himself. 'Holly Lea' contained 53 rooms on three floors spread over an area of with lavish period furnishings and other embellishments. It is believed that at the time, 'Holly Lea' was the largest wooden residence in New Zealand. Later known as McLean's Mansion, the house is registered as a Category I heritage building by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust. McLean remained a bachelor. After building his dream house, he enjoyed its ambiance for 5 years before dying there in 1907 aged 85. His health had been failing for some time He was buried at Addington Cemetery in the family grave; his mother, brother John and sisters Mary and Alexandrina were buried there before him. Through his will, McLean made generous provisions for an institute that used his house \\"as a home for women of refinement and education in reduced or straitened circumstances\\".

The parish takes in the northern Shoalhaven City region. It incorporates the Church Communities of St Michael, Nowra; St Patrick, Berry, Sacred Heart, Bomaderry; Mary, Help of Christians, Culburra; St Joseph, Kangaroo Valley; and Holy Spirit, Vincentia.Parish Website History According to the Australian Catholic Directory the district of the Shoalhaven (now the Parish of Nowra) was established in 1863. This means that 2013 will mark the 150th anniversary or Sesquicentenary of the parish.Parish Life 29 January 2012 When the Illawarra Mission was established in 1838, Fr John Rigney made monthly visits to the Shoalhaven, to celebrate Mass and the sacraments. In the 1840s a wooden building was constructed in Nowra to serve as a Mass chapel and as the first school. The 1841 Catholic Directory noted that there were an estimated 150 Catholics in the Shoalhaven district and that an average of 80 attended the monthly Mass. The parish of Shoalhaven-Ulladulla was established in 1863 with Fr David D‚ÄôArcy as the first resident priest. In 1865 the Mass centre at Nowra was rebuilt and it was to remain the Mass centre for Nowra for another twelve years. It was first thought that Numbaa would be the centre for the Shoalhaven parish; but the Shoalhaven River floods of the 1860s and 1870s caused the main settlement to move to Nowra. Because of that, the building of the church at Numbaa, for which a foundation stone had been laid in 1869, did not proceed. The original presbytery at Numbaa, given to the Church by David Berry, still stands. Other centres also constructed their own church buildings. The original Kangaroo Valley church, with accommodation for only 30, was built in 1874. In November, 1875, Archbishop Roger Vaughan laid the foundation stone of St. Michael's Church Nowra. He later blessed and opened it on 30 September 1877. It cost 1,200 pounds. Two years later, land was purchased at Berry, and 21 March 1884 saw the opening of the new church there. The first Nowra presbytery was to cost 295 pounds. It was later to serve as the first convent from 1893-1905. According to the Catholic Year Book of 1882 the churches in the Shoalhaven parish were: St Michael's, Nowra; St Patrick's, Broughton Creek; St Mary's, Ulladulla and St Joseph's, Kangaroo Valley. There were also Mass stations at Greenwell Point, Coolangatta, Milton and Woodburn. Weekday Mass was in the church and sometimes in the presbytery (which was still at Numbaa). The Catholic population was estimated to be about 1,200. On 8 October 1887, the present presbytery was opened, having cost 900 pounds. In 1888 the Sisters of St Joseph arrived in Berry and opened their school for 48 children. The same year saw the opening of the present St Joseph's Church, Kangaroo Valley, at a cost of 849 pounds. On the 6 November 1921, the blessing and opening of the extensions of St Michael's Church, Nowra, took place. Twenty feet were added to the length of the church, the gallery was constructed and the shingles on the roof were replaced by tiles. The extensions were in harmony with the fabric of the church. The cost had been 1,660 pounds. Later that day, there was the blessing of the foundation stone of the new convent at Berry. The new church at Berry was opened in 1936. The next parish priest, Monsignor John Purcell arrived in December 1956. He immediately embarked on an extensive programme of school building, then church extensions and renovations. In 1959, the building of Sacred Heart Church, Bomaderry; in 1963, further renovations to St Michael's in 1969; the building of Our Lady, Help of Christians‚Äô Church, Culburra in 1978; Holy Spirit Church, Vincentia, in 1983 and the re-establishment of a Catholic High School in Nowra, with St John the Evangelist High School. With over 9,000 Catholics, six churches, three other Mass centres and over 600 children in St Michael's School, much has been achieved in this parish in 150 years. The Sisters of St Joseph left Berry in 1978, and St Patrick's School closed the following year. The current parish priest, Fr. Patrick J. Faherty took up the office in 1993. St Michael's Church, Nowra (1877) St Michael's, Nowra is a Gothic Revival church opened on 30 September 1877. The church is built of squared rubble stonework in courses and originally had a shingle roof. The stonework is generally in good condition and despite several additions over the years, the southern and western elevations still indicate the original character of the building. The style of the church is known as Early English Gothic (1189 - 1307) also known as Lancet which is most marked by the simplicity of its ornament. Early English Gothic elements can be seen in the stained glass window to the western wall, the tall narrow window openings, projecting buttresses, articulated quoins and steep pitched root. The stonework to the western stained glass window when viewed from the outside has architectural origins dating back to 1170. In 1921 additional accommodation was constructed on the eastern end. The original church extended to the present choir loft. The addition was sympathetic to the original church, however the shingle roof was re¬¨placed with tiles. Additional stained glass windows were added at this time. Further additions were carried out in 1958 including the side entrance and sacristy. The parish also contains two schools: St Michael's Primary SchoolSouth Coast Register 25 January 2010 and St John the Evangelist High School.

It is one of a number of sinkholes in the area, all produced by tectonic and erosive processes on the region's limestone. Although not the largest and deepest of the area's sinkholes, it is best known because of a tourism project which focuses on the thousands of Mexican green parakeets who live there most of the year, flying in and out in circular patterns. Sima de Cotorras Ecotourism Center was established in 1985 to give local Zoque families an alternate means of generating income, preserve the local environment and give younger generations a reason to not migrate from the area. The project has built a road, a restaurant and cabins for visitors, and offers rappelling into the sinkhole as well as guided tours to see the cave paintings, the tropical vegetation at the bottom of the formation and the areas around the sinkhole rim. However, most visitors are local and visit for a day only to see the parakeets. The Center has had its problems balancing ecological concerns with keeping it economically viable. Location and environment Entrance to ecotourism park The sinkhole is part of a larger park called El Ocote Biosphere Reserve, located in the western part of the Mexican state of Chiapas, about 90 minutes from the state capital of Tuxtla Gutierrez. It belongs to the municipality of Ocozocoautla de Espinoza, about 19 km over rough roads from the town center. This part of Chiapas is dominated by the Zoque people, who call the area Coita, a Zoque word that means ‚Äúplace of rabbits.‚Äù The nearest community to the sinkhole is Piedra Parada, which has about 500 residents. The climate of the area is mostly warm and humid, with a rainy season from June to October, receiving an average of 1,500mm of precipitation per year. It is in the Sierra Madre de Chiapas, at an altitude of about 820 meters above sea level. This area gets cold enough in the winter to need a light jacket. Most of the vegetation of the area has been wiped out or severely degraded by agriculture, forestry and other human activity. Geology of the sinkhole Portion of the wall of the sinkhole showing stalactites The Sima de las Cotorras belongs to a Karst topography system, based on the folding, fracturing and erosion of limestone. This particular system is defined by its drainage system, with the La Venta River on the surface and the main underground river being El Para√≠so. Despite its proximity to the Pacific, drainage is towards the Gulf of Mexico. Most of this ecological system is covered by the El Ocote Biosphere Reserve. There are two main forces that shape the landscape. Tectonic forces from the movement of the North American plate over the Farallon and Cocos plates creates anticline folds, with a northeasterly orientation. The folding creates cracks in the relatively soft rock and water running above and below erode in and around these fractures. The two processes have created a number of formations including canyons, arches, caves, waterfalls, small pools of water and sinkholes. These same processes make the soil acidic and strewn with loose rock. Major formations include the La Venta River Canyon, the Arch of Time (Arco del Tiempo) and El Aguacero Falls. The Sima de las Cotorras is only one of 38 sinkholes in the region and one of eight within 10km2. It is not even the largest of these, being only half the size of the Las Luchas sinkhole. These sinkholes are vertical depressions formed by the cracking, erosion and collapse of limestone over thousands of years. The Sima de las Cotorras is meters deep, and in diameter, with a straight drop of meters. The opening is elliptical, with the north and southwest rims elevated in relation to the rest. The low point of the rim is in the east. The process reveals the layers of rock, and about meters down, stalactites and stalagmites can be seen among the layers from the surface. There are also caves within the sinkhole walls, which have also been produced by erosion. This type of sinkhole is similar to those found in the Yucat√°n, but in general these do not contain pooled water at the bottom. Biology of the sinkhole Two beetles mating on a flower on the park. Instead the interior of the sinkhole is home to a tropical forest, whose plant and animal life is distinct from that of the surrounding ecosystem. El Ocote is home to a number of endangered species, especially birds such as Psittacara holochlorus, Amazilia viridifons and Oporornis tolmiei, as well as other receiving special protection such as Eucometis penicillata, Lanio aurantius, Psarocolius montezuma and Colinus virginianus. Numbers and types of birds present depends on the time of year, due to migratory patterns. The wider reserve serves as a buffer area for the microclimate of the Sima de las Cotorras. Outside the sinkhole and up to its rim, the climate is drier, mostly grassland/shrub from cattle grazing, and areas called lomer√≠a, rocky areas with limited growth, mostly shrubs, due to dense limestone. In some of the higher elevations there are still some forests. Around the sinkhole itself, there are many copal trees, Protium copal (family Burseraceae), which gave the sinkhole its original name of Sima del Copal. The interior of the sinkhole holds and preserves more moisture. From its bottom grows a tropical deciduous rainforest microsystem with broadleafed species such as cedar, mahogany, Fabaceas espinosa and Burseraceas baja, Manilkara zapota, scrubs of the family Guaiacum and more, with trees reaching as high as 30 meters tall. The plant species here are not found outside the sinkhole. Fungi in rainy season Common reserve fauna includes owls, foxes and coyotes, rabbits, opossums, badgers, squirrels, armadillos, Penelopina nigra, chachalacas and of course, parakeets. The park has over 80 bird species in 30 families. Eleven of these are migratory and three are endemic to the area. Seven bird species are classified as endangered by the Mexican government. Most of the bird species 35 of them, are found in the low deciduous rainforest of the sinkholes. These include species which are highly sensitive to human intrusion such as Colinus virginianus, Caprimulgus vociferous, Amazilia candida and Ortalis vetula. A number of bird species have been found in the Sima de las Cotorras area but not in the larger El Ocote park, including Bubo virginianus, Amazilia viridifrons, Vireo philadelphicus, Sialia sialis, Passerina versicolor and Cacicus melanicterus. Gulambere on Sima de las cotorras. The Sima's most famous resident is Psittacara holochlorus, the Mexican parrot, which is endangered. Chiapas is home to over 68% of Mexico's parrots (family Psittacidae). And many of Mexico's parrot species are endangered, mostly due to shrinking habitat, along with the illegal pet trade and other exploitation of the animals. There are an estimated 3,000 parrots associated with the sinkhole and they can be found there most of the year, with the exception November to January, when the weather is too cool for them. The forest of the sinkhole is also their nesting site. From the evening until the early morning, the parrots are congregated in the sinkhole forest, where the noise they make can be quite loud. The parrots‚Äô noise will cease if a predator such as a falcon is seen nearby. The parrots leave the sinkhole to look for food, which includes from mango trees in people's backyards as far away as Tuxtla Gutierrez. They leave the sinkhole in groups, flying in circles on wind currents in order to leave and enter. Inside the sinkhole, the parrots are the most numerous kind of bird. Outside, it is dominated by small birds of the family Tyrannidae. Archeological site Evidence of human habitation in the area goes back at least 7,500 years, with evidence of hunter/gatherers. However, there were no major pre-Hispanic settlements in this area. The area of the park was first explored and academically documented in the mid 20th century, noting local caves and archeological finds such as pottery. But documentation still remains sparse especially in comparison to other such sites in Mexico. The significant archeological find in and around the Sima de las Cotorras are cave paintings, arrowheads, and much later pottery shards, possibly Zoque. The most important of these are the cave paintings, which number about 75. On a rock outcropping on the north wall, there is a human figure with lance, and with a sun and moon above. One of the side caves has on its roof the outlines of hands made by blowing red ochre onto the wall. Other images include circles, spirals and animals. The appearance of cave painting in such a geological formation and especially so high up the sinkhole walls makes them a rarity, and the site is under consideration by UNESCO for protective status. Ecological park The El Ocote Biosphere Reserve was established in 1972, extendingover 8 hectares, protecting over a hundred species of birds, and dozens of mammals, reptiles and insects, some endangered. With the exception of the Sima de la Cotorras, the park has not been developed for tourism, and its formations are almost completely unknown outside of their region. The other sinkholes in the area get no tourism activity at all. The tourism activity based on the flight of the parrots has made the sinkhole relatively famous and it is now better known as the ‚Äúsinkhole of the parrots‚Äù rather than its official name. Tourism activity here began with the establishment of the Sima de Cotorras Ecotourism Center in 1985 and the building of a road from the town of Ocozocoautla to the site. The center was established to provide alternative work for the local Zoque people. Today it is run by the Tzamanguim√≥ cooperative, which consists of a number of families all from the nearby community of Piedra Parada. The project is also registered with the federal government as an ecotourism site, with the aim of being sustainable, providing income for local residents with minimal impact. The group welcomes researchers as well as visitors onto the site. The main challenge has been how to take advantage of the site without damaging it. The ground is unstable and highly porous. Many underground cavities are still unknown, making building risky. The largest structure on the premises is the restaurant. Built near the rim, its site was chosen because of the stability of the rock, not because it was the most aesthetically pleasing place to put the structure. Waste disposal is a main issue because of the threat of groundwater contamination, prompting several composting activities. Bringing water, electricity and more are also challenges. By far the main attraction of the site are the parrots that fly in and out of sinkhole each day, generally leaving in the early morning and returning at night. It is also possible to rappel to the bottom of the sinkhole, as well as explore local caves and hike both in and around the sinkhole.

The Center has eight cabins for up to five persons each, a camping area and tours with local guides. Tourists practicing rappel, descending from Sima de las Cotorras. It has eight cabins which can house five people each. It currently has a restaurant, several cabins to house multiple people, a camping √°rea, a path around the rim of the sinkhole, rapelling and tours to see the cave paintings and the rainforest that covers the sinkhole's floor. The Center has provided an alternative source of work other than agriculture and for some, a means for income when before they had none. Despite this, the project has not been claimed as a great success. According to theses done at the Universidad Intercultural de Chiapas, the tourism possibilities here have not been fully exploited. As of 2016, only about 10 to 15 people per day visit the site. Most visitors come by their own cars or through local ecoadventure tourism agencies. Most tourists are between 41‚Äì60 years of age, followed by the 31-40 age bracket and those in the 18-30 year bracket. About half come from the state capital of Tuxtla Gutierrez, with about 13% from Mexico City, 12.5 from other parts of Mexico. Only about 2 percent are foreigners. The main problems for the site are the lack of promotion and poor access. The roads leading to the site are very poor, especially the last ten km, and signage is poor or non-existent. The park is difficult to access for those with disabilities. Most visitors learn of the site through word-of-mouth, with some from television and much fewer from other media. The lack of services means that those who do come do not stay for long. Two-thirds come only to see the parrots, some will stay and eat at the restaurant, but very few stay the night. The project over the years has received intermittent support from various government institutions such as PEMEX, the Secretary of Tourism, SEMARNAT and the Comision Nacional para el Desarrollo de los Pueblos Ind√≠genas, in areas such as finance, customer service and construction. But these interventions have not always been helpful, with functionaries using technical jargon and dismissing local knowledge of the area. Changes in political parties has led to varying attitudes towards the project and its ecological focus, with errors being made such as cutting down trees to make way for cement electrical poles and the construction on non-composting toilets. At its height, the Center generated about 80 to 100 jobs directly, but since the tourist demand has declined. The project is specifically geared to keep young people in the area, but they have not shown sufficient interest in its continuation. Most members of the cooperative are between 50 and 80 years of age. Only about 30% of the local population recognizes the area's intangible value, but 80% favor efforts to make the area better known. Even with sufficient interest and promotion, the area is not suited for large-scale tourism. One reason is the need to keep ecological concerns first and the other is that alternative and eco-tourism are not major attractions for most Mexicans.

It oversees the United States system of managed care used by state Medicaid agencies in which a primary care provider is responsible for approving and monitoring the care of enrolled Medicaid beneficiaries, typically for a small monthly case management fee in addition to fee-for-service reimbursement for treatment. In the mid-1980s, states began enrolling beneficiaries in their PCCM programs in an attempt to increase access and reduce inappropriate emergency department and other high cost care. Use increased steadily through the 1990s.  History  In 1981, the 97th session of Congress enacted the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) which allowed state Medicaid programs to implement risk-based managed care programs as well as PCCM, pending HCFA (now known as CMS) waiver approval. The state had to meet two requirements in order to be granted HCFA approval. * The case management restrictions must not \\"substantially impair access\\" to primary care services of \\"adequate quality where medically necessary;\\" and * The case management restrictions must be \\"cost effective.\\" In their earliest forms, PCCM programs closely resembled traditional fee-for- service Medicaid than managed care. Some states developed PCCM as a first step towards risk-based managed care and considered their MCO contracts as the main managed care system. As PCCM programs matured, state goals have expanded to improving quality of care provided. States have used strategies similar to network management principles used by MCOs. PCCM programs have evolved over the past two decades through the addition of a variety of care management and care coordination features. These include payment innovations; increased care management resources; improved performance monitoring and reporting; increased resources for management of serious and complex medical conditions; and a variety of ‚Äúmedical home‚Äù innovations, including performance-based reimbursement, better use of information technology, increased contact with patients, and efforts to provide additional resources for physician offices.  Intent  By 1986, seven states had implemented PCCM programs. By 1990, that number had grown to 19. States were motivated to implement PCCM programs for several reasons: * States wanted to increase access to health care. State officials tried giving participating physicians a small payment to encourage physicians to accept more Medicaid beneficiaries. Each beneficiary would choose or be assigned a participating physician who would serve as his/her medical home. * States felt physicians would like PCCM more that risk-based managed care. * States hoped to save money by eliminating unnecessary or inappropriate emergency department (ED) and specialist visits, lab tests, and other high-cost care. * States thought PCCM would be well-suited for rural areas where MCOs have difficulty maintaining an adequate population base for financial viability.  Prevalence of PCCM  As of July 1, 2010, approximately 21% of the almost 39 million Medicaid enrollees who were enrolled in a comprehensive managed care plan were enrolled in a PCCM program. * These 8 million consumers participate in PCCM programs in 31 states. * There are 11 states which offer PCCM as the only managed care option. * Illinois, North Carolina, Texas and Louisiana have the largest PCCM programs, each with over 700,000 enrollees. * Approximately 30 percent of SCHIP enrollees are served by PCCM systems.  Organization of PCCM programs  In most PCCM programs, PCPs are paid a per member per month fee for each Medicaid beneficiary or an increase in preventive service fees to pay for case management services. In addition, PCPs are paid on a fee-for-service reimbursement for all primary care services that he/she provides. HMOs are not involved. In return, the PCP is responsible for providing primary care and for prior authorizations to hospitals and specialty care providers.Complete information about the BBA and Medicaid managed care, including the actual text and a series of letter to states from HCFA(now known as CMS) regarding the BBA, is available at http://www.hcfa.gov/medicaid/bbahmpg.htm Physicians bear no financial risk for the services they provide or approve. State Medicaid agencies may include additional activities, such as medical management, network management or performance incentives, to improve outcomes and generate cost savings. States vary in how they manage provider networks, provider recruitment, data collection and analysis, monitoring, quality improvement, patient education, disease management programs and enrollment. Some states perform all these programs in-house using state employees; other states contract out all or some of these functions.  Scientific evidence  States that have tried implementing PCCM programs have encountered mostly positive results: * PCCM has been shown to improve patient outcomes. A study of Medicaid-enrolled children in Virginia found that immunization rates were higher among PCCM enrollees than among enrollees in either mandatory or voluntary HMO programs. * Disease management programs, a prominent part of many PCCM programs, have shown to improve health outcomes by increasing communication between the patient and his/her PCP. * The cost effectiveness of PCCM is thought to derive from increased preventive services and less use of costly services such as emergency department visits. A recent cost analysis of the Iowa PCCM program found that PCCM was associated with substantial aggregate cost savings over an 8-year period, and that this effect becomes stronger over time.

He could also be seen playing Les Paul Customs and Standards, as well as an Epiphone Les Paul Standard Baritone which was used for songs that required Drop A tuning. He could also be seen using guitars from other brands, such as a Schecter Celloblaster C5-X Baritone and an Ibanez Xiphos 7-string, both of which were also use in drop A tuning, although the Schecter was sometimes tuned to an alternate tuning where the lowest 3 strings are tuned to G in 2 octaves, and the remaining strings were tuned to D, and G above an octave (G-G-G-D-G). This tuning can be heard on songs like \\"Nothing Going On.\\" For amplification, the band claims to have never relied on traditional amplifiers; solely on pre-amps, speaker cabinet emulation, multi-effect processors, and amp modeling. During the 1990s and early 2000s, Torstensen mostly relied SansAmp preamps, starting with the original pedal Sansamp in the early-mid 1990s. A Boss ME-5 processor was used along with it. During the late-1990s and early 2000s, he relied on a small rack unit that contained a Tech21 SansAmp PSA-1 analog pre-amp, Digitech 2112 multi-effects processor for speaker emulations, and a wireless unit. From 2001 ‚Äì 2004, he began using a Boss GX700 pre-amp and multi-FX processor that ran into the Digitech or a Matchbox MB10 for speaker simulations. Sometime after the release of Zeroes and Heroes, he switched to using Line6 processors, relying on the PODxt series. This change is apparent in the band's next album Hate Yourself With Style, due to the guitars sounding less \\"processed\\" and more \\"metallic\\". In the studio, the POD would be run into a PA system power amp which fed into a Line6 4x12, which would be picked up via microphone. Live, the POD would run straight into the venue's PA system. Sometime during 2009, the band began using Fractal Axe-FX processors, which he would use until the end of the band.

Mining operations will produce 55 million tonnes of iron ore per annum with an operating life of more than 20 years. Gina Rinehart's Hancock Prospecting is the majority stakeholder in the project with a 70% interest. The remaining 30% stake is held by a consortium comprising POSCO (12.5%), Marubeni (15%), and China Steel Corporation (2.5%). As part of the ownership agreement the various consortium partners have also secured their proportionate share of iron ore production from the Roy Hill Project, representing a combined 16.5Mtpa of iron ore at full production. Mine development Project work commenced in mid-2011 and so far major dredging work of the harbour at South West Creek, within Port Hedland's inner harbour has been completed. Dredging will entail the removal of 7.5 million m3 of material to a depth of below the low tide mark, and the construction of two new shipping berths: Stanley 1 and Stanley 2. Construction of the Ginbata Airport at the mine site and internal mine roads have also been completed, as has clearing of the centre line for the railway.

The program now consists of vaccination for 12 diseases- tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough), tetanus, poliomyelitis, measles, hepatitis B, diarrhoea, Japanese encephalitis, rubella, pneumonia (haemophilus influenzae type B) and Pneumococcal diseases (pneumococcal pneumonia and meningitis). Hepatitis B and Pneumococcal diseases was added to the UIP in 2007 and 2017 respectively. The other additions in UIP through the way are inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), rotavirus vaccine (RVV) ,Measles-Rubella vaccine (MR). Four new vaccines have been introduced into the country‚Äôs Universal Immunisation Programme (UIP), including injectable polio vaccine, an adult vaccine against Japanese Encephalitis and Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine.

An adult vaccine against Japanese encephalitis will also be introduced in districts with high levels of the disease. The recommendations to introduce these new vaccines have been made after numerous scientific studies and comprehensive deliberations by the National Technical Advisory Group of India (NTAGI), the country‚Äôs apex scientific advisory body on immunisation. Vaccine benefits are debated with some urging caution in the choice of vaccines introduced while expanding the immunisation program, despite overwhelming and widespread documented scientific evidence on the efficacy of vaccines. With these new vaccines, India‚Äôs UIP will now provide free vaccines against 13 life threatening diseases, to 27 million children annually. Calling it one of the most significant health policies in the last 30 years, the note pointed out that the latest decision along with the recently introduced pentavalent vaccine, will help prevent death in about one lakh infants and adults in the working age group, besides putting a stop to about 10 lakh hospitalizations each year. ‚ÄúThe introduction of four new lifesaving vaccines, will play a key role in reducing the childhood and infant mortality and morbidity in the country.

It originally aired on Showtime on December 4, 2011. Brody is approached with an opportunity for a Congress seat. In an attempt to close in on Walker, the CIA targets the diplomat who made contact with him. Plot Vice President Walden (Jamey Sheridan) visits Brody (Damian Lewis) at his home. He offers Brody the chance to run for a seat in the House of Representatives soon to be vacated by the disgraced Richard Johnson. Brody accepts the offer. Jessica (Morena Baccarin), however, is resistant to the idea, fearing the media scrutiny and disruption to their lives. Jessica also reveals that she knows Brody and Carrie had an affair, much to Brody's surprise. Carrie (Claire Danes) and Saul have been digging for dirt on Mansour Al-Zahrani (Ramsey Faragallah), the Saudi diplomat who was found to be conferring with Tom Walker (Chris Chalk) at the mosque. He is heavily in debt, yet is making large deposits to a Swiss bank. He is also leading a closeted gay lifestyle, and they have photographs to prove it. Carrie and Saul corner Al-Zahrani at the bank he frequents, and stage an interrogation. Carrie presents the photos and threatens to out Al-Zahrani to his wives, his children, and his ambassador. Al-Zahrani calls her bluff, saying to go ahead and expose him, and that his wives already know he is gay. He starts to leave, but Carrie tries a new approach. She threatens to have Al- Zahrani's daughter, a National Merit Scholar attending Yale, deported to Saudi Arabia. Al-Zahrani finally agrees to cooperate, posting a signal at his house which indicates to Walker that they are to meet at noon in Farragut Square the next day. Brody tracks down Mike (Diego Klattenhoff) and tries to make amends after their falling out. Brody apologizes, and forgives Mike for his relationship with Jessica. He then asks Mike to appeal to Jessica to support his run for Congress. Brody also calls Carrie, wanting to discuss something personal. They agree to meet at Carrie's. Carrie is led to believe there will be possible reconciliation, and is heartbroken when Brody merely tells her he is running for Congress and wants to confirm that nobody knows about the affair they had. Al-Zahrani arrives for the meet at Farragut Square, where various agents are undercover and waiting to seize Walker when he arrives. Carrie is there coordinating the operation. A black man who looks like Walker arrives, carrying a briefcase, but none of the agents can confirm it is him. Carrie observes that the man is carrying a briefcase in his left hand and has a watch on his right wrist, but that Walker is known to be right-handed. As the man approaches Al-Zahrani, Carrie attempts to evacuate the area. Walker is watching through a window nearby and, with his cell phone, remotely detonates a bomb that is in the briefcase. The bomb explodes, killing Al-Zahrani, the Walker look-alike, and three bystanders, while grievously injuring many others. Carrie is left with a severe concussion. Jessica tells Brody that after discussing it with the children, they all fully support his run for Congress. Saul visits Carrie in the hospital. He tells her that the man who delivered the briefcase was a homeless man hired by Walker. Saul concludes that Walker was tipped off and that there must be a mole placed somewhere in the government. The duo watch Brody on television officially announcing his candidacy in the special election. Production The episode was written by consulting producer Henry Bromell, his second writing credit for the series. It was directed by Guy Ferland, his first directing credit for the series. The featured songs are All Blues and My Funny Valentine both by Miles Davis. The turning of Al-Zahrani pays homage to the turning of Grigoriev in Smiley's People by John le Carr√©.

It carries out cross-material conservation science, art technology and archaeometry studies of fine arts and cultural artifacts to determine composition, age and authenticity and provide advice on their restoration. It further conducts academic research on scientific issues concerning the care and preservation of monuments and archaeological sites. Founded in 1888 as the Chemical Laboratory of the Royal Museums in Berlin, it is the oldest museum laboratory in world and bears the name of its first Director, Dr. Friedrich Rathgen. The Laboratory also provides services to a number of international bodies, such as the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS), the International Council of Museums (ICOM) and the International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property (ICCROM). Facilities The laboratory is equipped with state-of-the-art analytical equipment, methods and procedures, including: *Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy (ESEM) *Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) *X-ray fluorescence and Micro-X-ray fluorescence (Œº-XRF and XRF) *X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) *Infrared (FT-IR) and UV spectroscopy (UV-Vis) *Gas chromatography‚Äìmass spectrometry (GC-MS) *High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) *Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) Other methods for the investigation of materials include a weathering chamber to simulate environmental conditions and mobile measuring systems for monitoring the physical and chemical environment for art works in situ.  Achievements  The Rathgen has exposed several scandalous forgeries, including paintings in the Beltracchi affair.

It was built in Germany in the 1990s and was used by Akaflieg Darmstadt students until it was lost in a crash. Design and development The Akademische Fliegergruppe of the Technical University of Darmstadt (Akaflieg Darmstadt) was first formed in 1921. It was, and is, a group of aeronautical students who design and construct aircraft as part of their studies and with the help and encouragement of their University. The D-41 was completed in 1993. It was designed to show that a two-seat sailplane of side-by-side layout, with its better visibility for the instructor, who sits in the rear seat in a tandem configuration trainer, and easier instructor-pupil communication, could have as high performance as one with the more usual tandem seat arrangement. The D-41 was constructed from mixed composite materials, using GRP, CRP and aramid reinforced polymer. It had a mid-set wing of straight double tapered plan with a continuous straight leading edge with almost no sweep. Flaps filled the whole of the trailing edge inboard of the ailerons. The forward fuselage and cockpit region was wider than that of a tandem seater but inclined seats kept the depth down, leading to a flattened oval cross section of not much greater area. The cockpit was covered with a long, single piece canopy reaching back to the wing leading edge. Behind the wing the fuselage became slender, ending in a T-tail with straight edged, tapered surfaces. The D-41 had a retractable central undercarriage. The side-by-side configuration requires cockpit ballast for solo flying and the D-41 also had provision for 200 kg (440 lb) of water ballast for competition flying. Operational history The D-41 was used by the Akaflieg students and proved popular, but was lost in a fatal accident during an aborted launch. A spin developed which it was impossible to recover from before crashing, killing both pilots.

Early life McIntyre was born in Christchurch, New Zealand on 5 February 1879. He was one of seven children born to George McIntyre, mayor of New Brighton in 1902. From early childhood, McIntyre suffered from poor health and was inclined not to socialize easily. However, he did enjoy several friendships with writers and musicians, playing the cello himself. His formal education concluded at the age of fifteen, wherein he began art studies at the Canterbury School of Art under the tutelage of Herdman Smith and Alfred Walsh. He took a five-year break from training between 1901 and 1906, during which time he shared a studio in Cathedral Square with Leonard Booth and Sydney Thompson. Career McIntyre resumed his art studies at a more advanced level when he returned to the art school in 1906. Little is known about McIntyre prior to 1909, though his artistic knowledge and education was limited to what he learned at the Canterbury School of Art, and the local artists of Christchurch. His artistic activity in New Zealand mostly focused on painting, with a few illustrations for his own books. In 1909, McIntyre relocated to England, settling into a rented studio on Cheyne Walk. In 1910, he began art studies at the Westminster Technical Institute under William Nicholson and Walter Sickert, as he was drawn to the Pre-Raphaelite painting style. Although shy and withdrawn, McIntyre exhibited his work widely while living and studying in England. Exhibitions included the Thames Valley Art Club in 1910 and the London Goupil Gallery in 1911. After the war, McIntyre continued to paint. In October 1918 he held a large exhibition at the Eldar Gallery; and in 1921, as a member of the Monarro Group, exhibited in the Goupil Gallery alongside Paul Signac, M.L. Pissarro and Lemaitre. McIntyre spent several years as an art critic for the Architectural Review. He reviewed the work of artists such as C√©zanne, Heckel, Signac and Hodler. McIntyre had an exhibition accepted with the Royal Academy in 1924, and in 1926 McIntyre stopped exhibiting.  Death and legacy  McIntyre died of a strangulated hernia on 24 September 1933 at age 54 in London, England. His work is represented in New Zealand's National Art Gallery, the Hocken Collections, and major galleries.

Life He was born in Auckland, New Zealand on 21 January 1904 and left school at the age of 14. In 1926 he began a long career in journalism when he started work at The New Zealand Herald as a proofreader. He married Harriet Munro in 1930. After World War II service in New Zealand in military intelligence he re- joined The New Zealand Herald, becoming a sub-editor in 1945 before leaving the following year. After spending some years working on aviation magazines and in public relations McIntosh returned to the Herald in 1957 as a senior sub-editor. Ronald McIntosh died in Auckland in 1977 and was survived by his wife, son, daughter and sister. Astronomical Work His interest in astronomy was kindled by the 1910 appearance of Halley's Comet, and at age 13 he made his first binocular observations of the Moon. From 1919 to 1950 he collaborated with a number of other New Zealand amateurs in naked-eye observations of meteors. The group recorded 15,627 meteors between 1927 and 1945, with McIntosh contributing about half. He drew on these observations when he published a number of research papers on meteors. One of his most important papers was An Index to Southern Meteor Showers. Published in 1935, it remained the standard work for more than 40 years. In 1927 he purchased a 14-inch Newtonian telescope which was used for lunar and planetary studies. Over a 30-year period he studied various lunar features and published papers based on his observations. He studied the crater Aristarchus for a long period, beginning in the early 1950s. His main planetary focus was Jupiter and he made many observations from 1927 to the 1960s. He also observed Saturn and Mars as well as Comets. McIntosh was also interested in the history of science, and published papers on the history of astronomy in New Zealand. He played a role in establishing the Auckland Observatory and devoted a lot of his time to popularising astronomy through lectures, planetarium sessions and newspaper articles. He was a long-time member of the New Zealand Astronomical Society (later the Royal Astronomical Society of New Zealand), the Auckland Astronomical Society, the American Meteor Society and the Royal Astronomical Society. Recognition His work was frequently acknowledged by Charles Pollard Olivier of the American Meteor Society and he was elected to the International Astronomical Union's Commission 22 on Meteors.

Career  James McDonald was born in Tokomairiro, South Otago, New Zealand on 11 June 1865. He began painting early in his life and took art lessons as a young man in Dunedin with James Nairn, Nugent Welch and Girolamo Nerli. He continued his art studies in Melbourne, Australia, but returned to New Zealand in 1901, where he worked as a photographer. From 1905 he was a museum assistant and draughtsman in the Colonial Museum, later to become the Dominion Museum and even later the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa). He began making films about various scenic sights. At the museum he was responsible for the maintenance of the photographic collection and the production of paintings, drawings and photographs for the Dominion Museum bulletins. Reproduction of He taua! He taua, painted in 1906 He began to gather information about MƒÅori tribal traditions. His films show poi dances and whai string games. He was probably the earliest known ethnographic filmmaker in New Zealand. In 1920 he filmed the gathering of the MƒÅori tribes in Rotorua, when they welcomed the Prince of Wales, and other aspects of the royal journey. He filmed traditional skills and activities, including the make of fishing nets and traps, weaving, digging kumara camps and cooking food in a hangi. Most of his often unedited and fragmentary negatives became only known in 1986 after restoration by the New Zealand film archive. In 1914, due to the poor health of his predecessor, J. A. Thomson, he was appointed as Interim Director of the Dominion Museum. One of his tasks was the design of the New Zealand coat of arms, for which the royal commission was awarded on 26 April 1911. He was appointed as Assistant Censor of Cinema Films in August 1918 and held this position for eight years. In 1926 James McDonald was appointed to the board of MƒÅori Arts, and in the same year he resigned from his posts in the museum. He moved to Tokaanu, where he helped building the Te Tuwharetoa School of MƒÅori Arts and Crafts. Its aims were the revival of traditional art, which was in danger of being lost, and the encouragement of the MƒÅori of Ngati Tuwharetoa to produce handicrafts for sale at home and abroad. The school received no state subsidies, so McDonald and his family suffered from considerable financial difficulties. McDonald earned mutual trust and deep respect from local MƒÅori. He died in Tokaanu on 13 April 1935 and was buried at Taupo cemetery. The School of Applied Arts, which he had founded, doesn't exist anymore, but many examples of McDonald's work have been preserved. Many hundreds of his photographic negatives are kept by the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. There are prints of his works in the collections of the Alexander Turnbull Library and the Bernice P. Bishop Museum in Hawaii. The four ethnographic films he has made are preserved in the collection of the New Zealand Film Archive Nga Kaitiaki or Nga Taonga Whitiahua. Family  On 29 April 1891 he married Mary (May) Brabin and had three daughters with her, Marjorie, Flora and Dorothy, as well as a son, Donald Douglas. On the marriage certificate they stated his activity as an accountant, which suggests that he was not able to earn a living as an artist.

Its narrative is based on the testimony of a former inmate at Tazmamart, a Moroccan secret prison for political prisoners, with extremely harsh conditions. Plot The plot is based around the events following the second failed coup d'etat against the late Hassan II of Morocco in August 1972. The protagonist is a prisoner in Tazmamart, who, despite being a fictional character, is based on accounts of the prisoners who survived their incarceration there. The plot focuses on how prisoners who were kept in the extremely harsh conditions of Tazmamart survived, through religious devotion, imagination and communication. The prisoners spent their sentences in cells that are described as being only five foot in height and ten foot long. The prisoners in the novel are not actively tortured, but are fed poorly and live without light. Reception Maureen Freely reviewed the book for The Guardian, and wrote that \\"it defies any expectations you might have built up from [knowing about Tazmamart]. It refuses the well-meaning but tired and ultimately dehumanising conventions of human rights horror journalism; it is not a political tract.... Although it is technically a novel, it is a novel stripped, like its subject, of all life's comforts.\\" Freely wrote about the main character that \\"there is something Beckettian about his limited environment and studied hopelessness\\", and compared his literary voice to \\"the language of Islamic mysticism\\". Freely ended the review: \\"It is, despite its dark materials, a joy to read.\\" The novel received the International Dublin Literary Award in 2004.

The 73rd Brigade was originally raised during World War I in September 1914 from men volunteering for Lord Kitchener's New Armies, and was assigned to the 24th Division. The brigade consisted of battalions from the East of England and spent the early months of its existence training. The brigade, with the division, departed for the Western Front in August 1915, fighting in many of the major battles of the war, such as the Battle of Loos, the Battle of the Somme, the Battle of Vimy Ridge, Battle of Passchendaele and in the Spring Offensive and the Hundred Days Offensive, which saw the war come to an end on 11 November 1918 .

It is based at Denison Barracks in Hermitage, Berkshire and became operational in April 2015. The brigade was named the 77th in tribute to the 77th Indian Infantry Brigade, which was part of the Chindits, an Indian Army guerilla warfare force led by Orde Wingate who used unorthodox tactics against the Japanese in Burma in World War II. The formation badge of the revived 77th shows a mythical Burmese creature known as a Chinthe in reference to the Chindits. History The first 77th Brigade was raised as part of the new army also known as Kitchener's Army and assigned to the 26th Division and served on the Western Front and the Macedonian Front during the First World War. Some of the past units include: * 8th Battalion, Royal Scots Fusiliers * 11th Battalion, Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) * 10th Battalion, Black Watch * 12th Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders * 77th Machine Gun Company * 77th SAA Section Ammunition Column * 77th Trench Mortar Battery Role and composition The Security Assistance Group (SAG)'s mission was to work with cross-Whitehall agencies to achieve the goals of Defence Engagement and Building Stability Overseas Strategies. 77th Brigade was created to draw together a host of existing and developing capabilities essential to meet the challenges of modern conflict and warfare, the unit's objectives will be similar to that of the SAG. Specifically, it is to: The SAG aimed to have a full strength of 453 military and civilian personnel and occasionally, personnel from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Department for International Development and the Stabilisation Unit may be attached to the Brigade or work with it, of this total there will be 440 military posts in the brigade with up to 42% of these being reservists.

It deployed to the Philippines in April 2015 to assist the Philippines Government in developing their contingency plans for natural disasters. 77th Brigade has formed a formal partnership with the 361st Civil Affairs Brigade, US Army Europe. The Brigade uses social media such as Twitter and Facebook as well as psyop techniques to influence populations and behaviour. David Miller said that it is \\"involved in manipulation of the media including using fake online profiles\\". In late September 2019 the Middle East Eye reported that Gordon MacMillan, a Twitter executive with editorial control over the Middle East and North Africa, is also a reservist officer in the 77th Brigade. Both Twitter and the British Army denied that they have a relationship or agreement. David Miller, a professor of political sociology at the University of Bristol who studies British government propaganda and public relations, said it was hypocritical of Twitter to close accounts alleged to be connected with non-Western governments while having links to the British Army.

It is monotypic, the only species being Crassadoma gigantea, the rock scallop, giant rock scallop or purple-hinge rock scallop. Although the small juveniles are free-swimming, they soon become sessile, and are cemented to the substrate. These scallops occur in the eastern Pacific Ocean. Description A rock scallop with a sponge covering its shell Adults of Crassadoma gigantea have one valve (the right valve) fixed to a base, often a vertical rock face. This valve often becomes deformed to fit the contours of the rock. The left valve is roughly circular but irregular in outline, thick and heavy, with deep radial ribs. Every third or fourth rib is clad with blunt spines that overhang each other. These often get abraded and worn smooth as the scallop ages. There are flaps of shell known as auricles on either side of the straight hinge. The general colour is brown with the inside of the shell being glossy white with a purple patch at the hinge and a large, central adductor muscle scar. Crassadoma gigantea grows to a diameter of in the intertidal zone and in the subtidal zone. Between the valves, the margin of the orange mantle can be seen, with a row of tiny blue eyes and a sparse fringe of short tentacles.Crassadoma gigantea (Gray, 1838) Intertidal Invertebrates of the Monterey Bay Area, California. Retrieved 2012-01-31.Subtidal Bivalves, Cephalopods, & Chitons: Crassadoma gigantea SeaNet. Retrieved 2012-01-31. Distribution and habitat Crassadoma gigantea is found on the Pacific Coast of North America, from British Columbia south to Baja California and Mexico. It does not move around as an adult but lives on the sea floor. Its favoured habitats include inside crevices and under boulders, or cemented to rock surfaces, corals or man-made structures such as harbour pilings. It is found at depths down to about .Crassadoma gigantea (Purple hinged rock scallop) Beach Watchers. Retrieved 2012-02-01. Biology Like other scallops, Crassadoma gigantea is a suspension feeder, filtering phytoplankton from water as it passes over the gills. The particles are moved by cilia along grooves to the mouth where edible matter is separated from sediment particles. The waste is incorporated into mucous balls which are removed from the mantle cavity periodically by a clapping of the valves.Learn about scallops A snail's odyssey. Retrieved 2012-02-01. Crassadoma gigantea is cryptic and difficult to detect because of the sponges, sea anemones, hydroids, barnacles, bryozoans, worms and algae which tend to grow on the shell. The parasitic boring sponge Cliona celata damages the shell by making hollows in it. Additional shell material is laid down by the mantle tissue to compensate for this. Other sponges, such as the yellow boring sponge (Cliona californiana) that grow on the shell may be considered mutualistic, granting some protection against predators such as the sunflower starfish (Pycnopodia helianthoides) and purple sea star (Pisaster ochraceus). It has been found experimentally that rock scallops grow at a faster rate when living in deep rather than shallow water, perhaps because they are then less hindered by these fouling organisms. The sexes are separate in Crassadoma gigantea and spawning takes place in the summer. The veliger larvae that develop from the eggs form part of the zooplankton for about 40 days before settling, undergoing metamorphosis and beginning to form a shell. Juveniles are free living, are able to swim and can attach themselves temporarily to the substrate by byssus threads. By the time they have grown to in diameter they have usually cemented themselves to a hard surface and become sessile. Rock scallops can live for at least 20 years but by about half way through their adult life, growth slows, and energy is concentrated into gamete production.

The Flory‚ÄìRehner equation is written as: : -\\\\left[ \\\\ln{\\\\left(1 - u_2\\\\right)}+ u_2+ \\\\chi_1 u_2^2 \\\\right] = V_1 n \\\\left( u_2^\\\\frac{1}{3}-\\\\frac{ u_2}{2}\\\\right) where, u_2 is the volume fraction of polymer in the swollen mass, V_1 the molar volume of the solvent, n is the number of network chain segments bounded on both ends by crosslinks, and \\\\chi_1 is the Flory solvent-polymer interaction term. In its full form, the Flory‚ÄìRehner equation is written as: : -\\\\left[ \\\\ln{\\\\left(1 - u_2\\\\right)}+ u_2+ \\\\chi_1 u_2^2 \\\\right] = \\\\frac{V_1}{\\\\bar{ u}M_c} \\\\left(1-\\\\frac{2M_c}{M}\\\\right) \\\\left( u_2^\\\\frac{1}{3}-\\\\frac{ u_2}{2}\\\\right) where, \\\\bar{ u} is the specific volume of the polymer, M is the primary molecular mass, and M_c is the average molecular mass between crosslinks or the network parameter.

It is based on the party game \\"would you rather,\\" and centers on Snow's character Iris as she attends a dinner party, where she must partake in life-threatening games to help her sick younger brother secure a donor. The film premiered at Screamfest 2012. Plot Iris, a young woman caring for her sick younger brother Raleigh, is unable to afford the costs of his treatment for leukemia. Her brother's oncologist, Dr. Barden, introduces Iris to Shepard Lambrick, a philanthropist, who offers her a deal: if she wins a parlour game at a dinner party, he will pay for Raleigh's treatment and locate a bone marrow donor for him. Dr. Barden tells Iris that he once played the game and won. Iris asks Shepard if she can think it over and get back to him if she chooses to go. Shepard says yes, but informs her that she must let him know before 8:00 p.m. After Iris finds out that she was not hired for a job she applied for, she contacts Shepard and lets him know that she will attend the dinner party. The next day at Shepard's manor, Iris is introduced to his son Julian and the other contestants: Lucas; Travis, a war veteran; Linda, a paralyzed elderly woman; Peter, a gambling addict; Amy, a woman whose daughter had drowned; Conway, an alcoholic debtor; and Cal. A steak and foie gras dinner is served but Iris, a vegetarian, initially declines to eat it. Shepard then offers her $10,000 to compromise her principles; she reluctantly accepts his offer and eats the steak. When Shepard realizes Conway is a recovering alcoholic, he offers him $10,000 to drink a glass of wine. When Conway declines, Shepard offers him $50,000 to drink an entire decanter of Scotch, which Conway accepts. After dinner ends, the game begins. Shepard reveals it to be a version of the party game \\"would you rather\\" in which players must choose between two options. Shepard gives his guests the opportunity to leave without playing, but everyone stays. After Shepard's butler, a former MI5 agent named Bevans, wheels in an electric shock machine, Conway attempts to leave but is shot dead. The remaining contestants learn how serious and deadly the game is, and that they can only win the game if they are the last surviving player. The 1st round is played by having 2 contestants at a time connected to the electric shock machine, and one person decides whether they should shock themselves or the other person. The contestants take turns making the difficult decision, and the round ends with no one eliminated. During a short break in between rounds, Travis gets into an argument with Julian, Shepard‚Äôs son, resulting in Travis being targeted for the next round. In the second round, each contestant has 30 seconds to choose between stabbing someone in the thigh with an ice pick or whipping Travis three times with a sjambok. After Iris debates her options of stabbing Cal or whipping Travis, Travis willingly submits to being whipped by Iris to save anyone from being stabbed. Julian smirks and snickers as Travis is whipped, revealing that Julian is behind Travis' fate. It is then Lucas' turn. He also chooses to whip Travis three times. Travis is then given the option to either stab Lucas or take three lashes from Bevans. He chooses to take the lashings, despite Lucas' attempts to stop him from doing so. Knowing Travis will not survive another whipping, Peter stabs Linda in the femoral artery and tries to stop the bleeding. Linda stabs Amy and Amy elbows her in the nose. Amy, who is more focused on eliminating everyone else, is allowed to stab any player she wants and chooses Iris. Instead of stabbing Iris in the leg she stabs her on her side, close to her lung, trying to get Iris eliminated by killing her. With Lucas' help, Iris lives. However, it is then revealed that Linda has died from her wound. Cal chooses to whip Travis so he'll have a higher chance of winning by rendering Travis unresponsive. Lucas causes a distraction, and everyone except Amy attempts to escape the room. Cal advances on Shepard with the sjambok as Lucas attacks the guards and Iris escapes. After Shepard shoots and kills Cal, the others surrender. Shepard sends Bevans and Julian after Iris. Julian finds Iris first and attempts to rape her, but she stabs him with the ice pick. Dr. Barden, who has had second thoughts about sending Iris to Shepard, breaks into the mansion to save her. Drawn by her cries, Dr. Barden and Bevans converge on her. Bevans kills Dr. Barden, escorts Iris back to the game, and sends Julian upstairs. The third round begins with each player having 30 seconds to choose to be submerged underwater, in a barrel, for two minutes, or an unknown task written on a card that is placed in front of them. Peter chooses his card, which requires him to light a firecracker in his hand. Shepard has Bevans secure a quarter stick of dynamite in place with duct tape. The explosion destroys Peter's hand, causing a heart attack, and he dies. Lucas' card forces him to slit open his own eye within 30 seconds; he does so and survives. Iris chooses the barrel and survives; her card is revealed to have all of her teeth extracted. Amy then chooses her card and learns that she must be submerged underwater for four minutes. She drowns. Only Iris and Lucas remain for the fourth round. Iris goes first, and is given the choice to either shoot and kill Lucas to win the game, or spare him which would result in both walking away empty-handed. As Lucas attempts to talk her into sparing him and explains the struggles of his family, she shoots Lucas in the chest killing him. Shepard crowns her the champion, gives her a bag full of money and explains that a donor has already been located for her brother. When Iris arrives home, she finds Raleigh asleep on his bed so she showers the blood off her. She then discovers that Raleigh had committed suicide by overdosing, meaning there was no point in her playing the game.

Biography  James C. Keck graduated from Carmel High School in Carmel, New York, in 1942 and then went to Cornell University where he majored in physics and minored in mathematics. An outstanding student in physics, in 1944 he was drafted into the Special Engineering Detachment of the U.S. Army, given the rank of technical sergeant, and sent to Los Alamos to work on the atomic bomb project as part of the Manhattan Project. Keck left Los Alamos in 1946 and returned to Cornell to complete his studies in nuclear physics, receiving his B.S. in 1947 and his Ph.D. in 1951. He completed his Ph.D. under supervision of Robert R. Wilson. His early interests included high-energy particle physics: Keck carried out pioneering research in photo-nuclear reactions and in spectral radiation from high-temperature shock-heated air. In 1952, after serving as a research associate at Cornell University, Keck left for the California Institute of Technology, where he served as a research fellow until 1955. That year, he joined the Avco Everett Research Laboratory, where he researched the reentry of missiles and spacecraft into the atmosphere. At the time of his departure from AERL in 1965, he served as its deputy director. In 1965, Keck joined the faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he began researching the problem of burning rates and pollutant formation in internal combustion engines. His experiments and theoretical studies showed many things about such engines: how nitric oxide is formed in them, the nature of turbulent flame propagation, and the nature of Engine knock. His work is widely used in the automotive industry in the design of efficient and clean engines. After retiring from MIT, Keck advised graduate students at Northeastern University. Personal life Among his many life-changing events at Los Alamos was his meeting another physicist, Margaret Ramsey, one of the few women scientists employed on the Manhattan Project, which she joined in 1945. She also left the project in 1946 and went to Indiana University to pursue a master's degree, which she completed while working in physics at Cornell University. She and Keck were married in 1947. They both were employed in the physics department at Cornell through 1952. They have one son, Robert, a senior scientist at the Laboratory of Laser Energetics at the University of Rochester in New York and one daughter, Pat, a sculptor who currently lives in Andover, Massachusetts.

MTV EXIT MTV EXIT picked up the song to help raise awareness about human trafficking. The band worked with MTV EXIT to produce a music video, which was released on April 15, 2011. =Music video= The music video begins with a close-up of lead singer Kyle Patrick, playing his guitar. The scene then switches to show several people living their lives normally, having fun and socializing, but wearing blindfolds. The blindfolds symbolize that people are not aware of what is happening around them, which is the case for human trafficking. The band is then shown blindfolded playing their instruments as Patrick's vocals come in. More scenes of people wearing blindfolds appear. The scene switches to a girl, a victim of human trafficking, crying. A caption on the screen reads, \\"AT ANY ONE POINT 2.5 MILLION VICTIMS ARE TRAFFICKED WORLDWIDE\\". A still of a girl holding a teddy bear is shown, the girl crying for help and the mother reaching out for her daughter. The girl is being snatched from her family to be sold to the multi-million industry of human trafficking. Three more captions are shown: \\"1.2 MILLION CHILDREN ARE TRAFFICKED EACH YEAR\\" & \\"30% OF FEMALE VICTIMS ARE FORCED INTO LABOR.\\" A photo of a group of females doing manual labor appears. Another shows a man holding a woman, wearing a \\"FOR SALE\\" sign. Then, \\"70% OF FEMALE VICTIMS ARE TRAFFICKED INTO THE COMMERCIAL SEX INDUSTRY.\\" The video switches to show a female being abused by a handler. Next: \\"ANNUAL REVENUE GENERATED BY TRAFFICKING IS OVER $32 BILLION\\". Finally, after displaying \\"CHANCES ARE IT'S HAPPENING RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU\\", the band members start to take off their blindfolds, along with the others in the video. This symbolizes people becoming aware of human trafficking. More scenes of victims are shown. The members of the band are shown listening to survivors sharing their stories. At the end, lead singer Kyle Patrick reaches out to the camera and shuts it off.

Industrialist, an activist in the field of education, culture and voluntary causes and philanthropist. Life History Not much information about the personal life of Stanislaw Szymanski is available. From existing sources, it can be learnt that he was born in Kalisz in the year 1862. As a young man, he went to college in Germany, but he finished his studies in tsarist Russia at Saint Petersburg State Institute of Technology with an engineering degree. After graduation, he moved to Warsaw. Further information about his stay and activities in the capital city was not found. Next notes about him appeared after his appearance in Zawiercie where he arrived with his wife presumably before 1895 (the exact date is not known). In the same year, he began building his villa (to this day called The Szymanski's Palace) on the then Franciszek Szymanski street. The name of the architect who designed the villa was Hugo Kudera. Only few years after his arrival at Zawiercie, in 1901, Szyma≈Ñski was elected to a post of a chairman of Rada Nadzorcza Towarzystwa Po≈ºyczkowo-Oszczƒôdno≈õciowego in Zawiercie. And in 1907, he was appointed the general manager of Towarzystwo Akcyjne ‚ÄûZawiercie‚Äù factory and he held that position even after his departure from Zawiercie in 1931. In the same year, in December 1907, he became headmaster and chairman of the teaching staff in a newly built school for children of TAZ factory workers. He was also appointed president of Ko≈Ço Opieku≈Ñcze Rodzic√≥w in a private male gymnasium(1916), president of ≈ªe≈Ñskie Seminarium Nauczycielskie (1916), and also president of the local body of Doz√≥r Szkolny in Zawiercie (1919‚Äì1931) In June 1910, he stood at the head of the very first Polish Touring Companionship department in Zawiercie, which he helped to establish. Whereas in 1927, he became chairman of an organization which took care of the castle ruins Ogrodzieniec and of other monuments in the region. After granting a city charter to Zawiercie in 1915, Szymanski began his political activity on a local level. In the same year, in April, he was elected to be chairman of the city council, a function which he held for two terms. He was also a member of the city board. He belonged to the Christian- Democratic Party of which he was a leading activist in the region and had major influence in the board of the party in Warsaw. As ≈öwiat magazine stated, Szymanski left Zawiercie in 1931 and went to Warsaw. Again, records about his later activities after his departure are unknown. The last information mentioned his death on April 23, 1944. Stanislaw Szymanski was buried on PowƒÖzki Cemetery. Szyma≈Ñski‚Äôs achievements In Zawiercie, a figure of Stanis≈Çaw Szyma≈Ñski is dwelled upon because of his great contribution in the development of the city in the first half of the 20th century. The list of his services is significant. As the manager of TAZ, he used his position and money for developmental purposes. As the part of TAZ factory activities, a housing estate for the workers was built. Szyma≈Ñski extended it by building new living quarters and also public facilities which concentrated the cultural activities of workers. Szyma≈Ñski also brought forward a project of a school for children of TAZ factory workers. In order to fulfill that plan, all workers were taxed. The building was designed by Hugo Kudera. Construction began in 1906 and lasted over a year. An opening ceremony took place on 12 December 1907. This date is particularly mentioned in various sources because of the patriotic speech made by Szyma≈Ñski that day. As part of his educational and cultural activities, he also contributed by assembling the qualified teaching stuff and forming children's choral and musical group in TAZ school. Szymanski was also famous for his charitable work which he did during the crisis which struck the city before, and after the First World War. In 1910, he co-founded a Christian charity. That organization subsidized the orphanage for poor children and provided support for unemployed families. When the World War I broke out, a majority of industrial plants in the city were closed off. It caused a massive unemployment and hunger. Since 18 September 1914, the social canteen was held which served free dinners; it was founded by TAZ and charity organization. Szyma≈Ñski had a seat on the canteen board. Sources * Jerzy Abramski, Encyklopedia Zawiercia, Cieszy≈Ñska Drukarnia Wydawnicza, Zawiercie 2002. * Monografia Zawiercia, red.

Shortly before 1am on November 3, he was shot by police using a less-lethal round while he was filming a stationary line of police in riot gear, hours after the 2011 Oakland general strike but during ongoing street clashes between protestors and police in what the San Francisco Chronicle described as \\"chaos after midnight.

University of South Carolina criminal justice professor Geoffrey Alpert said that unless something occurred off-camera to provoke the officer, the shooting was \\"one of the most outrageous uses of a firearm\\" he'd ever seen. \\"Unless there's a threat that you can't see in the video, that just looks like absolute punishment, which is the worst type of excessive force,\\" Alpert told the Oakland Tribune.

He began life in the army commissariat, and served in the Peninsular War, being present at the siege of San Sebasti√°n. Leaving military service, he devoted himself to art, though with little success. He exhibited landscapes, sea-pieces, and military subjects at the Royal Academy and the British Institution between 1820 and 1847. In 1831 he was a founding member and the first Hon Secretary of the New Society of Painters in Water Colours. He later became better known as an art critic and writer. Towards the close of his life he was curator of the St. Martin's Lane academy. He died on 23 December 1850. Works Taylor's best-known book was his History of Dublin University (1845) illustrated with coloured plates and with engravings. It contains biographical notices of many of the alumni of Trinity College, Dublin. He published also The Origin, Progress, and present Conditions of the Fine Arts in Great Britain and Ireland (1841) and A Manual of Fresco and Encaustic Painting (1843). He translated Prosper M√©rim√©e's Art of Painting in Oil and Fresco (1839), and made an abridged translation of the Origin and Progress of the Penitentiary System in the United States (1833), from the report of Gustave de Beaumont and Alexis de Tocqueville.

They are found in the Mediterranean Sea and on both sides of the north Atlantic Ocean. Description The hectocotylus of a male Illex coindetii showing closeups of two suckers. The arrows at the top mark the boundaries between the proximal, middle, and distal portions of the hectocotylus. Mature specimens of Illex coindetii from different populations can vary significantly in both size and form. They are sexually dimorphic, with females being typically larger than males. The maximum recorded mantle length is in males and in females. These unusually large specimens, however, are not typical of the species. The average mantle length is between in males and in females. The eight arms bear two rows of suckers with teeth. In males, the longest of the arms is about 55 to 90% of the total mantle length, while it is 48 to 57% in females. The tentacles have eight longitudinal rows of suckers on the dactylus of the tentacular clubs. The largest middle suckers on the tip are also notched on the rim farthest from the body or all around. In males, the fourth left or right arm develops into a secondary sexual organ known as the hectocotylus. It is of equal length or shorter than the undeveloped opposite arm and of the same diameter. The suckers on the distal third of the hectoctylus are lost and replaced with lamella-like flaps and conical papillae. The upper part of the beak (rostrum) has a long and robust hood, smooth shoulder and short wings. The lower beak has a straight and long jaw edge and wide and long wings with no lobes. The mantle is cylindrical with a width 15 to 25% of the mantle length. It is widest in the front region except in gravid females. The funnel‚Äìmantle locking apparatus (cartilaginous structure connecting the funnel to the mantle) is T-shaped, a characteristic of all ommastrephid squids. The funnel groove (depression on the bottom front part of the mantle where the funnel rests) is smooth and lacks foveola (pockets of skin found in ommastrephid squids of the subfamily Ommastrephinae). The fins are rhomboidal in shape, with a width of around 45 to 60% of the mantle length. Like other members of the genus, Illex coindetii lacks photophores (bioluminescent structures). Taxonomy The species was first described as Loligo coindetii by the French naturalist Jean Baptiste V√©rany in 1837, from a specimen recovered from the Mediterranean Sea in Nice, France. Illex coindetii is one of the four species currently recognized under the genus Illex. The genus is the only member of the subfamily Illicinae in the commercially important squid family Ommastrephidae. Populations can vary in form and size considerably, but two consistent morphotypes have been tentatively identified between specimens from the Mediterranean and the Atlantic. Despite the wide distribution range of Illex coindetii and its highly variable morphology, a 1998 study confirmed that Illex coindetii is indeed a single species. Distribution and habitat Illex coindetii is the most widespread species in the genus Illex. They can be found in the Mediterranean Sea and on both sides of the North Atlantic Ocean, from as far north as the Bristol Channel to as far south as the Gulf of Mexico and along the coasts of Venezuela, Suriname and Namibia. They have also been reported from the Red Sea, but it is likely that the specimens in question were misidentified. Newer studies suggest a new and rising population in the North Sea, benefiting from overfishing and acceleration of their life cycles by rising sea temperatures. Illex coindetii are neritic, oceanic, and benthic species. They can usually be found at depths of from the surface in the western Atlantic, in the eastern Atlantic, in the Caribbean, and in the Mediterranean. The maximum recorded depth they have been recovered is about . Ecology and biology Illex coindetii inhabit muddy, sandy, and silty bottoms often in association with sea pens of the genus Funiculina. Larger and smaller individuals are more often found in deeper and shallower waters respectively, but otherwise the adults and juveniles share the same depth range. Some populations have been observed to exhibit migration into shallower waters during spring and deeper waters in the winter. Illex coindetii also exhibit diel vertical migration, daily movements in which the squids stay in deeper waters during the day and move up the water column during night to feed. The dominant prey of Illex coindetii includes fish, crustaceans (particularly krill in some populations), and other cephalopods. Occasional prey include arrow worms and tunicates. They are known to engage in cannibalism. The ratio between males and females in Illex coindetii is roughly 1:1. The species spawns throughout the year, though seasonal peaks have been observed in spring and summer in some areas. Males produce from 81 to 1,555 spermatophores, varying in length between . Larger males produce a greater amount and larger-sized spermatophores. Females may mate more than once and it is estimated that they contain a maximum of 800,000 eggs (both mature and immature) in their ovaries. The eggs are around in diameter. They hatch 10 to 14 days after being laid. The paralarvae are active swimmers and have a mantle length of up to . Like other members of the family Ommastrephidae, the paralarvae exhibit distinctive fused tentacles called the \\"proboscis\\". It is characteristically 50 to 75% of the mantle lengths of the paralarvae. The proboscis begins to divide into the pair of tentacles once the paralarvae reach a mantle length of . Importance Illex coindetii is one of the two squid species most frequently fished for human consumption in the northeastern and central Atlantic (particularly in Spain and Portugal), the other species being the lesser flying squid (Todaropsis eblanae). In the Mediterranean, they constitute an important by-catch of the fishing industry in Sicily, along with the European flying squid (Todarodes sagittatus).

Description Three ancient and semi-natural woods form the SSSI, namely Frithy Wood in Lawshall parish and Ashen Wood and Bavins Wood on the Chadacre Estate in Shimpling parish. All three woods are of the wet ash (Fraxinus excelsior) / maple (Acer campestre) type, with hazel (Corylus avellana) also present in considerable quantity. There are pedunculate oak (Quercus robur) trees and other tree and shrub species include aspen (Populus tremula), wild cherry (Prunus avium), midland hawthorn (Crataegus laevigata), hornbeam (Carpinus betulus), crab apple (Malus sylvestris), holly (Ilex aquifolium), spindle (Euonymus europaeus) and common dogwood (Cornus sanguinea). The structure of the woods has been greatly influenced by management of the coppice. The three woods have a diverse woodland floor vegetation, which is dominated by either dog's mercury (Mercurialis perennis) or brambles (Rubus spp.). They contain a number of plants characteristic of woodlands of this type including herb paris (Paris quadrifolia) in Ashen Wood and wood spurge (Euphorbia amygdaloides), woodruff (Galium odoratum), sanicle (Sanicula europaea) and stinking iris (Iris foetidissima) in Frithy Wood. The SSSI lies within the distribution of oxlip (Primula elatior) and all three woods contain this species. There are many other woodland floor plants including early purple orchid (Orchis mascula), twayblade (Neottia ovata), gromwell (Lithospermum officinale) and bluebell (Hyacinthoides non-scriptus). There are several well-vegetated rides in the group of woods that support a mixture of woodland and meadow plant species and which attract considerable numbers of common butterflies. Frithy Wood also contains an area of pasture which projects into the wood which is partly shaded by a number of standard trees. The birdlife of Frithy Wood has been recorded in detail with species including the nightingale, European green woodpecker, great spotted woodpecker and lesser spotted woodpecker which breed regularly. Roe deer, fallow deer and muntjac can also be seen in the woods but they have caused considerable damage to the ground vegetation. Forest school Forest school sessions are held in Frithy Wood by permission of the landowners. The 'school' represents an initiative of All Saints Primary School, Lawshall and the Green Light Trust, an environmental and educational charity. History Oliver Rackham has stated that \\"a wood now called The Frith is almost certain to be pre-conquest, from Old English Fyrhp.\\" In a later book he stated that \\"an Anglo-Saxon (parallel) is fyrth, a wood, which has given rise to many Frith or Frithy Woods.\\" There is documentary evidence for the existence of Frithy (formerly Frith) Wood back to 1545 and its Saxon name would imply that the wood is much older than that. All three woods are part of ancient woodland and contain broad boundary banks and ditches typical of coppice woods dating from the medieval period or before. In more recent times in the twentieth century pigs were kept in Frithy Wood and at one time the wood extended as far as The Street. Newspaper records On 31 August 1921 it was reported in the Suffolk Free Press that the remains of George Nunn aged 55 of Lawshall were discovered hanging in Frithy Wood. He had been missing for around 4 months since 22 April and was found a short distance from where he lived. Access The woods are not private with easy access.

The species has been introduced in Australia as a biological control agent of Opuntia stricta. Adults are on wing from mid- January to May and again from late August to early November. There are two generations per year. The larvae feed on Opuntia rufida, Opuntia macrorhiza var. macrorhiza, Opuntia stricta var. stricta and Opuntia lindheimeri var. lindheimeri. Larvae of the first generation are gregarious and bore into young cladodes of the host plant. Older larvae are solitary and feed on older cladodes, entering near the top and boring down through the center. The tunnel itself is filled with frass causing the stem to swell where injured.

Kalinkina's editorship In 2003, its editor was Svetlana Kalinkina. The paper began to publish reports and features critical of Lukashenko's government, including a series on the trial of Viktor Kazeko, former director of the state food company, a story on the corruption trial of former Minsk Tractor Works director Mikhail Leonov, and a poll asking readers whether Lukashenko should be allowed to have his presidential plane for personal use. Reporter Iryna Khalip's articles on official corruption led to a brief suspension of the newspaper's printing rights for \\"insulting the honor and dignity of the president\\". Soon the paper was reportedly subject to a campaign of official harassment, including \\"politically motivated tax inspections, death threats and detentions\\". Belarus's Information Ministry began to harass any printer that agreed to work with the paper, forcing BDG to print in Smolensk, Russia. The print edition of BDG had largely disappeared from Belarus by September 2004, leaving only the website. Kalinkina then took a leave of absence from the paper to work against a national referendum that would eliminate presidential term limits, allowing Lukashenko to serve indefinitely. The referendum passed, and Kalinkina took a new position at Narodnaya Volya. In 2004, the Committee to Protect Journalists awarded Kalinkina its International Press Freedom Award, \\"an annual recognition of courageous journalism\\", for her work with BDG. The award citation praised her \\"critical reporting on various government abuses\\" in the face of \\"years of legal and bureaucratic harassment from Belarusian authorities\\". Print run cancellation On 13 March 2006, a week before the presidential election that would usher in Lukashenko's third term, BDG, Narodnaya Volya, and Tovarishch had their print runs abruptly cancelled by their Smolensk supplier. Kalinkina told The New York Times that she believed Belarusian government pressure to be responsible, saying, \\"When, a week before the election, someone refuses to print three papers, it is clear there are political reasons.\\" Shortly after, increasing financial pressures forced the paper's closure.

DC offered Moore and Gibbons chances to publish prequels to the series, such as Rorschach's Journal or The Comedian's Vietnam War Diary, as well as hinting at the possibility of other authors using the same universe. Tales of the Comedian's Vietnam War experiences were floated because The 'Nam was popular at the time, while another suggestion was, according to Gibbons, for a \\"Nite Owl/Rorschach team\\" (in the manner of Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased), and also in the sense that the original Charlton characters Blue Beetle and The Question had worked together as a team from time-to-time).

The closing of the company (plant) drew considerable attention in the 2012 U.S. Presidential election because of scrutiny of the business dealings of Mitt Romney who had founded Bain Capital which had acquired controlling interest of GST Steel in 1993 for $24.5 million. Romney had left Bain in 1999 before the bankruptcy. Employees noted that Bain had loaded the company with debt while earning profits ($58.4 million). At the time of its bankruptcy it said it owed $553.9 million in debts against $395.2 million in assets. In 2002 it was revealed the company had underfunded the pension for employees by $44 million. GS Steel derives its name from Georgetown Steel which operates a steel plant in Georgetown, South Carolina. The South Carolina and Missouri operations were combined by Bain. The South Carolina plant closed in 2003. That plant reopened in 2003 with a different owner (International Steel Group) later Mittal Steel and later ArcelorMittal. During the 2012 U.S. Presidential election laid off plant worker Joe Soptic was featured in an advertisement against Romney claiming that his wife died of cancer after he lost his health insurance in the closing. The ad stated \\"When Mitt Romney and Bain closed the plant, I lost my healthcare, and my family lost their healthcare. And a short time after that my wife became ill.\\" An investigation by The Washington Post showed that Soptic's wife had died of cancer in 2006 five years after the plant closed and that she had her own health insurance at the time of the closing but lost it after she left that job in 2002.
