He became commercially successful in the 1970s. In 1977, he won the International Senefeld award for Lithography. He has since become one of the most successful Italian artists in Germany and one of Germany's best known lithographers. Biography Born in Gradara, in the Province of Pesaro and Urbino on the Adriatic Coast in 1935, the son of a railway attendant, Bruni started painting as a young boy. He was initially a pupil of Giuliano Vanghi [1]; from 1953 to 1959 he attended the Art Institute in Pesaro. He then moved to London, where he became interested in pop art. In 1960, after an exhibit of his work at London's John Whibley Gallery, and after meeting a girl from Hamburg, he moved there to live with her and enrolled at the Hochschule f√ºr bildende K√ºnste Hamburg. He has lived in the city ever since and visits his hometown regularly. In the 1970s, Bruno Bruni made a name for himself as a draftsman, lithographer, painter and sculptor in the international art world. In 1977, he won the International Senefeld Competition for Lithography. He is influenced primarily by German expressionists like Otto Dix, George Grosz etc. and the Italian old masters . In particular, he is noted as one of the few lithographic artists \\"who paint all work directly onto the stone\\". He is especially known for his erotic female forms. He has said, \\"I cannot paint an abstract picture. If I had gone along with the trends I'd have disappeared long ago\\". He resides in a converted swimming pool, more than a century old, which serves as apartment, workplace and gallery. He sells his art through his wife's gallery in Hanover and is reputedly one of Germany's top earning artists. He is also a keen cook of Italian cuisine, and is a boxing fan and a close friend of former boxing champion Dariusz Michalczewski, for whom he used to cook for before matches. He has also cooked for Gerhard Schr√∂der and has published a cooking book with his favourite recipes, memoirs and pictures related to his life.

He composed the solo cantata for soprano in Leipzig in 1727 for the Sunday Septuagesima, and led the first performance, probably on 9 February 1727. Bach composed the work in his fourth year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig. The text is similar to a cantata text ' (I am content with my position), which Picander published in 1728, but it is not certain that he wrote also the cantata text. Its thoughts about being content are in the spirit of the beginning Enlightenment, expressed in simple language. The closing chorale is the 12th stanza of the hymn \\"\\" by √Ñmilie Juliane von Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt. is one of the few works which Bach called \\"Cantata\\" himself. Bach structured the work in five movements, alternating arias and recitatives, and a closing chorale. The scoring requires only a small ensemble of a soprano soloist, three additional vocal parts for the chorale, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of oboe, strings and basso continuo. While the first aria is pensive and elegiac, the second aria is of dancing folk-like character.  History and words  Bach wrote the solo cantata in Leipzig, in his fourth year as Thomaskantor (director of church music) in Leipzig, for the third Sunday before Lent, called Septuagesima. The prescribed readings for the Sunday were taken from the First Epistle to the Corinthians, \\"race for victory\\" (), and from the Gospel of Matthew, the parable of the Workers in the Vineyard (). Bach had already composed two cantatas for the occasion in earlier years, , in 1724, and the chorale cantata , in 1725. is one of the few works which Bach called \\"Cantata\\" himself. As in the earlier years, the cantata text is related to the gospel in the general way that the Christian should be content with his share of good fortune, without envy of others who may seem more fortunate. The title and the text show similarities to Picander's (I am content with my position), published in 1728. It is unclear if both texts are by Picander, or if Picander based his on a former one, or if Picander's was already available at the time of the composition but was changed. As the Bach scholar Klaus Hofmann observes, the thoughts are in the spirit of the beginning Enlightenment, \\"praise of frugality, of modesty with that which God has allocated to us, of satisfaction, of lack of envy towards others\\". The language is no longer the \\"rhetorical pathos of baroque poetry\\", but \\"radicality and artistry of the imagery. The language is simple and terse; it is rational rather than figurative.\\" The author of the hymn lyrics The closing chorale is the 12th stanza of the funeral hymn \\"\\" by √Ñmilie Juliane von Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt (1686). Bach had used its first stanza in his cantatas (1724) and in (1726). Bach led the first performance, probably on 9 February 1727.  Music  = Scoring and structure = Bach structured the cantata in five movements. A sequence of alternating arias and recitatives is concluded by a chorale. Bach scored the work for soprano soloist, a four-part choir only in the chorale, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of oboe (Ob), two violins (Vl), viola (Va), and basso continuo. The heading of the autograph score reads: \\"J.J. Dominica Septuagesimae Cantata\\", which means: \\"Jesus help. Cantata for the Sunday Septuagesima\\". Bach added a more precise extra page: \\"Dominica Septuages. / Ich bin vergn√ºgt mit meinem Gl√ºcke / √† / Soprano Solo √® / 3 Ripieni / 1 Hautbois / 2 Violini / Viola / e Continuo / di / Joh:Seb:Bach\\". The scoring is modest, appropriate for the weeks leading to Lent. The duration is given as about 16 minutes. In the following table of the movements, the scoring follows the Neue Bach-Ausgabe. The keys and time signatures are taken from the book on all cantatas by the Bach scholar Alfred D√ºrr, using the symbol for common time (4/4). The continuo, playing throughout, is not shown. = Movements = Although the vocal and instrumental parts are limited, Bach achieves variety by movements of different instrumentation and character.  1  John Eliot Gardiner, who conducted the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage, in 2007 The opening aria, \\"\\" (I am content with my fortune which our dear God has allotted me.), is slow and pensive, accompanied by all instruments, reminiscent of the slow movement of an oboe concerto. John Eliot Gardiner, who conducted in 2000 the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage, noted in the project diary that Bach, who possibly was not content with his situation in Leipzig, composed music portraying \\"ambivalence and complexity\\". His music is \\"dynamic and fluctuating\\", capturing \\"wistful, resigned, elegiac\\" moods. The musicologist Julian Mincham notes that the aria compares to Ich bin in mir vergn√ºgt, BWV 204 (I am content in myself) which he describes as \\"also a highly personal work for solo soprano with a similar theme, exploring comparable human emotions\\".  2  The first recitative, \\"\\" (God indeed owes me nothing), is secco.  3  The second aria, \\"\\" (I eat my little bit of bread with joy and heartily leave to my neighbor his own.), is dancing and accompanied by two obbligato parts, oboe and violin. They express in vivid figuration in the violin and a slightly simplified version in the oboe the text \\"\\" (a happy spirit, a thankful heart, that gives praise). Hofmann observes that the aria depicts a \\"pastoral idyll with a rustic musical scene ‚Äì a tribute to the Enlightenment utopia of simple, happy country life.\\" The violin's figuration suggests the drone of bagpipes or hurdy-gurdy. The voice leaps in upward sixths, in \\"folk-like character\\" and conveying \\"contented tranquillity\\". Mincham notes that the first four notes of the oboe ritornello are the first four notes of the closing chorale turned to major.  4  Georg Neumark, the writer of the hymn tune The second recitative, \\"\\" (In the sweat of my brow I will meanwhile enjoy my bread), is accompanied by the strings.  5  The chorale, \\"\\" (Meanwhile, I live contented in You and die without any trouble), is a four-part setting of the tune \\"Wer nur den lieben Gott l√§sst walten\\" by Georg Neumark. Gardiner interprets the marking a soprano solo e a 3 ripieni (for soprano and three ripieno parts) as meaning that no instruments play colla parte with the voices.  Recordings  The listing is taken from the selection provided on the Bach Cantatas Website. In the following table, ensembles playing on period instruments in historically informed performance are marked by a green background.

It reacts with secondary amines like MDMA and methamphetamine to give a blue solution. Uses The primary use of this reagent is for detecting secondary amines, such as MDMA and methamphetamine, and is typically used after the mecke or marquis reagents to differentiate between the two mentioned and amphetamine or MDA. Chemistry The reagent is typically provided in two parts: * A mixture of 2% sodium nitroprusside and 2% acetaldehyde in water (solution A) * A solution of 2% sodium carbonate in water (solution B) Separate storage of the aldehyde and base are necessary to prevent aldol polymerisation of the aldehyde. When exposed to an amine, reaction with acetaldehyde produces the enamine, which subsequently reacts with sodium nitroprusside to the imine. Finally, the iminium salt is hydrolysed to the bright blue Simon-Awe complex. Acetaldehyde can be replaced with acetone, in which case the reagent detects primary amines instead, giving a purple coloured product. =Testing Method= A drop from each solution (A and B) is dripped onto the substance being tested, causing the two solutions to mix together.

Early life Born in Ann Arbor, Michigan, McLean moved to Tulsa, Oklahoma when she was five. McLean's parents were children's church pastors at Faith Christian Fellowship (FCF) located in the predominantly black North Side of Tulsa and threw Friday night parties at a community recreational center to give at-risk kids a place to go other than the streets. Immersed in black culture, McLean wrote and performed her first rap at age ten during a church talent show. While in middle school, McLean learned to play piano by ear, but by her senior year of high school, she was being regularly suspended for fighting and later found out she was pregnant. After graduation, she was arrested for stealing and identity theft and was incarcerated while pregnant. McLean was released from jail shortly before giving birth to a daughter and began hustling to support herself and the child. Music career =2006‚Äì2010: Early career= Her self-produced independent album Underestimated (2006) sold 5000 copies and led to a brief affiliation with Swisha House. During this time, she opened shows for various major label recording artists, including Fergie, Paul Wall, Akon, Too $hort, Afroman, and Nappy Roots. McLean's relationship with her boyfriend turned violent in 2008, leading to an armed standoff with police after which he was incarcerated and McLean fled to Seattle to hide out with friends, leaving her daughter with her mother in Tulsa and during which time she stopped writing and recording music. =2010-2011: Rise to fame= McLean would resurface in 2010 on the pop/rock single \\"Spain\\" with producer Mark Bryan, which received modest radio play in various markets.

McLean was brought to the attention of German-American digital imprint Block Starz Music by a fan who submitted her video to the music company's website. \\"Honestly, we we're expecting it to be nonsense,\\" said Peppy Johnson, Block Starz Vice President of A&R.; \\"But from the moment she started rapping, her skill and talent level were undeniable. We believe, with a strong team around her, she has enormous commercial potential.\\" She announced her official signing to the label September 1, 2011 during a live Ustream interview and performance on Zedalza New York. In a statement released through her label in December 2011, Lega-C confirmed the existence of a pornographic home video and pictures taken by her abusive ex-boyfriend. =2012: Off My Medication = Lega-C's debut album on Block Starz Music, titled Off My Medication, was released October 31, 2012.

Oculus of the Pantheon, Rome, an open skylight. A skylight (sometimes called a rooflight) is a light-transmitting structure that forms all or part of the roof space of a building for daylighting purposes. History Open skylights were used in Ancient Roman architecture, such as the oculus of the Pantheon. Glazed 'closed' skylights have been in use since the Industrial Revolution made advances in glass production manufacturing. Mass production units since the mid-20th century have brought skylights to many uses and contexts. Energy conservation has brought new motivation, design innovation, transmission options, and efficiency rating systems for skylights. Prior to the Industrial Revolution, it was France that probably had the leading technology in architectural glass. One of the earliest forms of the glass skylight can be seen at the Palace of Versailles in the Galerie des Batailles, which was added onto the existing palace by Louis Philippe in 1830. Another form that displays early sky lighting technology is the Halle aux bl√©s (Paris) built in 1763‚Äì67. This form of natural overhead lighting allowed for illumination while decoration could cover the entire interior wall, and it is the option least obstructed by other buildings. This means that sky lighting as we know it, in many forms today, was probably pioneered in France during the early 18th century or late 17th century. According to architectural glass, the earliest functional skylights would have been formed by either glass casting, crown glass (window), cylinder blown sheet, and machine drawn cylinder sheet, or Fourcault process.Sunlighting as Forgiver for Architecture, Lam Description Solar-powered venting skylight in Southern California. The skylight of M√ºnster's shopping mall \\"Arkaden\\". Fixed unit skylight, roof view. Fixed unit skylights, interior view. Skylighting types include roof windows, unit skylights, tubular daylighting devices (TDDs), sloped glazing, and custom skylights. Uses include: * daylighting elements used to allow direct and/or indirect sunlight, via toplighting. * providing a visual connection to the outdoor environment to interior occupants. * sustainable building‚Äîpassive solar heating, and with operable units; ventilation for passive cooling and fresh air exchange. ; Open skylight An unglazed hole in a roof. ; Fixed unit skylight A fixed skylight consists of a structural perimeter frame supporting glazing infill (the light-transmitting portion, which is made primarily of glass or plastic). A fixed skylight is non-operable, meaning there is no ventilation. ; Operable skylight An operable (venting) unit skylight uses a hinged sash attached to and supported by the frame. When within reach of the occupants, this type is also called a roof window. ; Retractable skylight Image:20-foot-by-20-foot-bi-parking retractable-skylight.jpgA large (20' x 20') steel and glass retractable skylight, seen from the roof. Note the steel tracks that the skylight rolls on, to retract. Image:20-foot-by-20-foot-bi- parking retractable-skylight-from-interior.jpgThe same retractable skylight, seen from the interior. This is a bi-parting skylight, meaning that it parts in the middle to open. Image:Bi-parting-over-stationary-ridge- skylight.jpgThis ridge skylight wraps over the highest point of the roof - the ridgeline. Image:Steel-and-glass-skylight-with-architectural- detail.jpgThis is that same skylight, from the inside. Steel allows large spans, without a grid of supporting tubes and cables. A retractable skylight rolls (on a set of tracks) off the frame, so that the interior of the facility is entirely open to the outdoors, i.e., not impeded by a hinged skylight. The terms retractable skylight and retractable roof are often used interchangeably, though skylight implies a degree of transparency. ; Tubular daylight device File:750Dome.pngActive daylighting uses a tubular daylight device‚ÄîTDD TDD skylight on the roof terrace of Liverpool Central Library Active daylighting uses a tubular daylighting device (TDD). Solar tubes, sun tunnels, or tubular skylights consist of a roof-mounted fixed unit skylight element, condensing sunlight, distributed by a light conveying optic conduit to a light diffusing element. Being small in diameter, they can be used for daylighting smaller spaces such as hallways, and bounce light in darker corners of spaces. TDDs harvest daylight through a roof-mounted dome with diameters ranging from about 10 inches for residential applications to 22 inches for commercial buildings. Made from acrylic or polycarbonate formulated to block ultraviolet rays, the dome captures and redirects light rays into an aluminum tubing system that resembles ductwork. ;Sloped glazing Sloped glazing differs from other ‚Äúskylights‚Äù in that one assembly contains multiple infill panels in a framing system, usually designed for a specific project and installed in sections on site. ;Pavement lights Pavement lights are walk-on skylights. They are set into sidewalks, open areas, and well-lit interior floors. ;Prism lights Prism lights are sometimes used as skylights; they redirect the light passing through. Solar architecture Skylights are widely used in designing daylighting for residential, public, and commercial buildings. Increased daylighting can result in less electrical lighting use and smaller sized window glazing (sidelighting), saving energy, lowering costs, and reducing environmental impacts. Daylighting can cut lighting energy use in some buildings by up to 80%.U.S. Department of Energy (DOE): Federal Energy Management Program; toplighting_final_report Toplighting (skylights) works well with sidelighting (windows) to maximize daylighting: # toplighting is able to bring light into centralized areas of a building # daylight is available throughout the day from both ambient lighting from the sky and direct exposure to the sun. # modern transparent and/or translucent glazing can be utilized to avoid glare, aid in capturing sunlight at low angles and diffuse light to wider areas of floor space. Even on overcast days, toplighting from skylights is three to ten times more efficient than sidelighting.AAMA: Daylighting Fact Sheet =Materials= Glass Many recent advances in both glass and plastic infill systems have greatly benefited all skylight types. Some advances increase thermal performance, some are focused on preserving and utilizing daylight potential, and some are designed to enhance strength, durability, fire resistance and other performance measures. Contemporary skylights using glass infill (windows) typically use sealed insulating glass units (IGU) made with two panes of glass. These types of products are NFRC-ratable for visible transmittance. Assemblies with three panes can sometimes be cost-justified in the coldest climate zones, but they lose some light by adding the third layer of glass. Glass units typically include at least one low emissivity (Low-E) coating applied to one or more glass surfaces to reduce the U-factor and especially SHGC by suppressing radiant heat flow. Many varieties of Low-E coatings also reduce daylight potential to different degrees. High purity inert gas is frequently used in the space(s) between panes, and advances in thermally efficient glass spacing and supporting elements can further improve thermal performance of glass-glazed skylight assemblies. Plastic Plastic glazing infill is commonly used in many skylights and TDDs. These assemblies typically contain thermally formed domes, but molded shapes are not uncommon. Domed skylights are typically used on low slope roofs. The dome shape allows for shedding of water and burning embers. Plastics used in skylights are UV stabilized and may feature other advances to improve thermal properties. Lack of accepted standards for measuring light transmittance is a disadvantage for comparing and choosing skylights with plastic glazing. Acrylic is the most common plastic glazing used for dome skylights. However, Polycarbonate and Copolyester materials are also used as glazing, where additional properties such as impact resistance may be required.AAMA Skylight Council Rating systems NFRC: rating for visible transmittance U-factor: expresses the heat loss performance of any building assembly. SHGC‚ÄìSolar Heat Gain Coefficient: measures the assembly‚Äôs transfer of heat from outside to inside that is caused by sunlight. These properties are labeled in the U.S. as a decimal between zero and one, with lower numbers indicating lower heat transfer rates. Depending on the geographic region, optimal U-factor and SHGC performance will vary. In the sunny southern climate zones, a lower SHGC is more important than lower U-factor. In the cooler northern climate zones, lower U-factor is more important, and higher SHGC can be justified. In selection of skylights, a balance is sought between low U-factor and optimal SHGC values, while preserving enough daylight supply to minimize artificial light use. Automatic light sensing controls for electric lighting maximize energy savings. =Benefits= A study concluded that students have significantly higher test scores in classrooms that optimize daylighting, than classrooms that do not.coe.uga.edu/sdpl/research/daylightingstudy: study of 21,000 students. Other studies show that daylight positively affects physiological and psychological well-being, which can increase productivity in many contexts, such as sales in retail spaces. In terms of cost savings, U.S. DOE reported that many commercial buildings can reduce total energy costs by up to one-third through the optimal use of daylighting. The majority of commercial warehouses and 'big box stores' built in recent years have used skylights extensively for energy/costs savings.

He was the victim of a widely publicised attack instigated by a local politician that almost cost him his life. 2001 assault case In January 2001, Tipu Sultan was working in Feni District where he investigated an arson attack on the Sultana Memorial Junior Girls School in Omarpur. The school that had just been completed. On 17 January, he filed a report for United News of Bangladesh, an independent wire service, implicating Joynal Hazari, an Awami League Member of Parliament nicknamed \\"the Godfather of Feni\\". On 25 January 8 days after his report on the destruction of the school, a group of approximately fifteen masked men abducted Sultan. He was beaten with sticks, bats and rods, both of his legs and hands were deliberately broken. The assailants particularly focused on his right hand, which he used for writing. According to Sultan, his attackers told him, \\"This is the order of Hazari.\\" After the beating, they left him unconscious beside the road. The following day, Sultan was transferred to Pangu Hospital in Dhaka for further treatment, as well as for his own safety. However, Pangu medical personnel would not operate on his right hand for fear of reprisals from Hazari. He was discharged before his treatment was complete. A group of Bangladeshi journalists then launched an international campaign on Sultan's behalf and managed to source sufficient funding to finance the transfer to Bangkok, Thailand. He was treated by orthopaedic surgeons at the renowned Bumrungrad Hospital and regained the use of his right hand within a year. Although Sultan attempted to file criminal charges against Hazari and his attackers, local Police refused to investigate or even accept the complaint until forced to do so by a court order. Hazari denied any involvement in the attack. Following a change of government in late 2001, the Police began to investigate the attack. On 16 April 2003, twenty- eight months after the original attack, Hazari and twelve other men were charged. However, eight of the thirteen suspects absconded, including Hazari, who had lost his seat in the 2001 general election and much of his political power. He was wanted for murder in an unrelated case and in 2003 sentenced in absentia to life in prison. He is thought to have fled to India. Bidan Majumder Sumon, one of the remaining suspects and the only person ever arrested for the attack, soon was released on bail. Sultan and his family received threats that they would be killed if they continued to pursue the case, causing Amnesty International to call for an \\"Urgent Action\\" letter- writing campaign on their behalf. A colleague and witness to the beating, Bakhtiar Islam Munna, was reportedly also threatened with death if he testified against Sultan's attackers. In the days leading up to the hearing, Munna was the subject of two murder attempts. In the second, a bomb was thrown at him near the entrance of his home. Munna escaped unharmed‚Äîthe bomb only damaged the road‚Äîbut withdrew his offer to testify. As Hazari could not be apprehended, the trial did not proceed. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), the attack on Sultan became \\"symbolic of the rising tide of violence directed against the press in Bangladesh\\", leading to both national and international outcry. In November 2002, Sultan was awarded the CPJ International Press Freedom Award, \\"an annual recognition of courageous journalism\\". He was also a finalist for the 2001 Reporters sans fronti√®res- Fondation de France Award, which went to Reza Alijani of Iran. By 2003, Sultan had moved to Dhaka and was working for the daily newspaper Prothom Alo.

During the Thirty Years' War, he was a senior officer. He climbed to the rank of Major General. Before 1635, he served on the Protestant side; after 1635, he served in the imperial army.  Background  He was the son of the Count George of Nassau-Beilstein and later Nassau-Dillenburg. His mother was Anna Amalie Countess of Nassau-Saarbr√ºcken. In 1616, he married in his first marriage Countess Catherine of Sayn-Wittgenstein (1588‚Äì1651). In 1653 he married his second wife Wild- and Rhinegravine Elizabeth of Salm-Dhaun (1593‚Äì1656). In 1656, he married his third wife, Sofie Magdalene of Nassau-Hadamar (1622‚Äì1658). He had five sons and eight daughters from his first marriage, two of the sons and four of the daughters died early. From his second marriage, he had another three sons, two of whom died early.  Early years  Louis Henry was first educated at the court in Dillenburg and later at Herborn Academy. He then made a Grand Tour to France and the Netherlands. He received his military training under Prince Maurice of Orange-Nassau. As early as 1614, he participated in the relief of Emmerich, which was besieged by the Spanish. Louis Henry and his brother Albert inherited Nassau-Dillenburg in 1623. They ruled jointly, until Albert died in 1626 and Louis Henry became the sole ruler.  Councillor Hoen and domestic policies  The Emperor had outlawed the Counts of Nassau-Dillenburg and Nassau-Hadamar for allegedly supporting Elector Palatine Frederick V. The Emperor had assigned their possessions to John VIII of Nassau-Siegen. This ruling was never carried out, thanks to the efforts of John Louis of Nassau-Hadamar. Even so, the military occupation of Nassau-Dillenburg from 1622 onwards, put a high strain on his land. Louis Henry saw reducing this damage as his main task. He only played a relatively small r√¥le himself. Policies were mainly drawn up and carried out by his councillor, the publicist and professor Philipp Heinrich Hoen (Hoenosius). Hoen also administered the county during Henry Louis long periods of absence. He also represented the interests of the House of Nassau and the Wetterau Association of Imperial Counts in the negotiations the led to the Peace of Westphalia.  In Protestant service  Louis Henry initially stood on the side of the Protestant Union. He joined the army of King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden as a colonel. He led an infantry regiment and later a cavalry regiment. His troops distinguished themselves in various battles, and Louis Henry himself showed personal bravery. He distinguished himself in particular during the storming of fortified cities and fortresses, such as the capture of Braunfels in 1635.  In the imperial service  Later that year, when the war seemed to turn against the Swedes, Louis Henry changed sides and joined the imperial side. He served the emperor as a senior officer and united his forces with those of Landgrave George II of Hesse-Darmstadt. In 1637, he held the rank of Major general and marched into Saxony. He then enjoyed the imperial favour at the court in Prague. In 1654, he was rewarded for his services by being raised to Imperial Prince.  Domestic policies after 1649  After Hoen died in 1649, Louis Henry tried to enforce an absolutist policy in Dillenburg. He was only partially successful. He also attempted to support Herborn Academy, which had been badly affected by the war, but eventually lost interest. Louis Henry died in 1662. Since his eldest son, George Louis had already died in 1656, Dillenburg was inherited by his grandson Henry.  Family  Louis Henry was married three times. His first wife was Catherine of Sayn-Wittgenstein (1588‚Äì1651), the daughter of Louis I, Count of Sayn- Wittgenstein. The couple had the following children: * Anne (1616‚Äì1649), married: *# in 1638 with Count Philip of Wied (d. 1638) *# in 1646 with Count Christian of Sayn-Wittgenstein (d. 1675) * George Louis (1618‚Äì1656), Hereditary Prince of Nassau-Dillenburg, married in 1638 with Augusta Anna, the daughter of Count Henry Julius of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel * Elisabeth (1619‚Äì1665) * Juliana (1620‚Äì1622) * Albert (1621‚Äì1622) * Catherine (1622‚Äì1631) * Louise (1623‚Äì1665), married in 1646 John Louis of Isenburg-B√ºdingen (d. 1685) * Unnamed daughter (1624) * Henry (1626‚Äì1627) * Magdalena (1628‚Äì1663), married in 1662 with Christian Maurice of Isenburg-B√ºdingen (d. 1664) * Adolph (1629‚Äì1676), Prince of Nassau-Schaumburg, married in 1653 with Charlotte (1640‚Äì1707), the daughter of Count Peter Melander of Holzappel * Philip (1630‚Äì1657) * twins (1631) * Maria Eleonora (1632‚Äì1633) After Catherine's death, he married Wild- and Rhinegravine Elizabeth of Salm-Dhaun (1593‚Äì1656), the daughter of Wild- and Rhinegrave Adolph Henry of Dhaun-Neufviller. However, she died soon after the wedding. In 1656, he married his third wife. She was Sophie of Nassau-Hadamar (1622‚Äì1658), the daughter of John Louis of Nassau-Hadamar.

The book was published in 1604, as a collection of many vernacular Italian proverbs and idioms, comparing and contrasting them with Greek and Latin. Description The Floris Italicae linguae libri novem, printed in Venice in 1604, is mostly known within the realm of scholarship and specialization. More cited than read, used as a repertoire of curiosities rather than as a proposal for a linguistic theory of the vernacular language, the book is currently experiencing a revival in contemporary debates.H. Burger, Phraseology, de Gruyter (2007), Vol.2, pp.978-979. Agnolo Monosini‚Äôs work originated from a will to respond to contemporary French writers, who in the 16th century were busy with demonstrating the relationship between their own language and ancient Greek, so as to circumvent the Latin inheritance and thus the primacy of Italian humanism over that of France. The relationship that Monosini develops between Greek and vulgar Italian, has all the limitations of the empirical and the author‚Äôs own enthusiasm for his method, with the result that the associations presented to the modern reader appear cumbersome and at times bizarre. Greek becomes the refuge of the vernacular in order to fill those linguistic gaps left by Latin, when the latter could not supply an etymology - this leading Monosini to credit Homer‚Äôs language with a series of words that have nothing to do with Greek roots. However, those Hellenic suggestions that Monosini made in his lexicon, one may take them for correct within an Indo-European perspective. The importance of Floris Italicae linguae libri novem is not altogether limited to the history of linguistics and lexicography. The systematisation with which Monosini progresses in the study of the presence of Greek in Italian draws a parabola from lexicon to morphology to the syntax of verbs and of the simple phrase, finally culminating in the proverb, which is considered the most characteristic and consolidated form of a language‚Äôs phraseology, and therefore the area that defines it more typically.F. Pignatti, A. Monosini, Etimologia e proverbio nell'Italia del XVII secolo - Floris italicae linguae libri novem, Vecchiarelli Editore (2011). Monosini develops his own comparative grammar model, again of an empirical and non-logic character, that proves to be an effective phenomenological description of the language: in fact, he records a good quantity of phrases, expressions, proverbs, sayings, idioms recurring both in the literary, cultural language, and in the popular usage, even including the vernacular and trivial strata. Here too, Monosini attempts to establish relationships between Florentine and Greek syntagmas as he has done in the lexicon, but at this point the Floris Books November Italicae tongue assumes the guise of proverbial repertoire, which makes it truly remarkable notwithstanding its original linguistic aim. This section of the book may be regarded as the principal 17th century collection of its kind, not so much for the size (definitely considerable), as for the taxonomic effort and the wealth of erudition accompanying it.M.

Features The Warbanks are ancient defensive ditches that are situated on the eastern parish boundary of Lawshall and extend into the neighbouring parishes of Cockfield and Shimpling. They are of very ancient origin and comprise long ramparts and ditches crossed by a Roman road (now the A134) running between Alpheton and Bradfield Combust, just north of Thorn Corner. It was formerly a single defensive system but there are now three parts, the Lawshall section being the most prominent. Dense timber on either flank on the flat heavy boulder clay along with the ramparts of the Warbanks would have made this a notable military post. The Warbanks were certainly pre-Roman and may have been an earlier defence system. A late Bronze Age sword (now in the Moyse's Hall Museum in Bury St Edmunds) was found on the site of the Warbanks and has been dated as 800-600BC and could give a clue to the age of the banks. A small bronze bust of a woman was found within the earthworks. The hair of the woman is plaited in twelve twists and fastened on the top of the head with a bow and there is also the bronze handle of a knife or mirror with a crowned female head at the end. Neothlithic implements have also been found in the Warbanks.

The Wairere Boulders is a popular tourist attraction in the area. Visitors can walk around the various trails, kayak down the boulder river and stay at the campsite. The property is owned by Graham and Paula Grant, who are originally from Scotland. They took over the property in 2017 and have sustainably developed the nature reserve, by extending and upgrading the trails, creating a campground, and opening a cafe. The farm is now a beef breeding enterprise, with Highland Cattle.  Walks  There are several walks ranging from 40 minutes to 3 hours, the walks take you under, over and around the boulders. The gigantic rocks are surrounded by subtropical rainforest, where much of the flora is beautifully labelled. The walks are through the Wairere valley which features an unusually large assemblage of basalt rocks. Added interest for families, include rock animals, fairy houses and a swimming hole.  Kayaking  Kayaking is available on the boulder river, the route taking you down through the mangroves and out to the Hokianga Harbour. Due to the tidal nature of the Boulder river Kayaking is tide dependent.  Construction  The walkway was originally constructed by Felix and Rita Schaad, who owned the property until 2017. The present owners Graham and Paul Grant have extended and upgraded the walkways.  Geology  The Wairere Boulders have slid down the hillsides from an eroding Pliocene basalt lava flow of the Kerikeri Volcanic GroupEdbrooke, S.W., Brook, F.J. 2009. Geology of the Whangarei area 1:250,000 Geological Map 2, GNS Science, Lower Hutt [formerly known as [Horeke basalts . Many of the boulders have deep solution basins and fluting formed on their surfaces as they very slowly slid down the valley sides - a particularly good example of the relatively rare phenomenon of karst formation on basalt (sometimes known as proto-karst).Kenny, J.A., Hayward, B.W. 2010. Karst in stone. Karst landscapes in New Zealand: A case for protection. Geological Society of New Zealand Guidebook 15, 40 pp. This phenomenon was documented by geologists as early as the 1920s-1940s in HawaiiPalmer, H.S. 1927.

Usually karst landforms are formed by solution of calcareous rocks (e.g. limestone and marble) by mildly acidic percolating water. At Wairere, and elsewhere, basalt has been dissolved, probably over a much longer interval of time, by the production of weakly acidic humic acid in the leaf litter that collects around the roots of plants that grow on the top of the boulders, usually beneath a forest canopy.Hayward, B.W., Kenny, J.A. 2011. Karst in basalt. Geoscience Society of New Zealand 3: 12-15. On the top of the boulders this humic acid has etched out solution basins 20‚Äì50 cm across and of similar depth. Humic acid seeping down the sides of the boulders has, over thousands of years, dissolved deep, near-vertical flutes out of the hard basalt. In some places the fluting is no longer vertical as the boulders have rolled over or tilted since it was formed. Basalt karst occurs in a number of places in northern New Zealand with some of the best examples at Wairere Boulders,Schaad, F. 2003. Wairere Boulders. Geological Society of New Zealand Newsletter 132: 32-36 but also at Stoney Batter, Waiheke Island; Ti Pt, Leigh;Hayward, B.W. 2012. Ti Point basalt karst. Geocene 8: 19-20. Lake Manuwai, Kerikeri; and Stoney Knowe, Helena Bay. Excellent examples of karst features developed on basalt boulders can be seen on Norfolk Island, Tasman Sea.

Built for the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway Company, it still carries the double-track Tyne Valley Line over the River Eden, and includes a cast iron footpath connecting Wetheral with Great Corby. This was added to the north face in 1851, because so many people were trespassing on the trackbed, in order to cross. Initially, a half-penny toll, each way, was charged, having risen to a penny by the time the station closed in 1956 (train services resumed in 1981). Pedestrian passage is now free. The bridge has five spans faced with red sandstone from Newbiggin Quarry near Carlisle. and filled with sandstone rubble from Wetheral and Corby Beck Quarries.

Biography Ursula Neugebauer studied visual art at the Academy of Fine Arts M√ºnster, where she was named a master student by Timm Ulrichs, as well as literature at the University of M√ºnster. She taught high school for a while and subsequently worked as an art therapist at the Universit√§tklinikum M√ºnster. From 1999 to 2002 she lectured in the Department of Architecture at the Technische Universit√§t Berlin. She has been professor of visual art at the Berlin University of the Arts. since 2003.  Works  She works as an artist at the interface between installation, object, space, and media. Her works stand in the tradition of a metamorphosis of everyday life and everyday objects that is as analytical as it is precise. By doing so she allows the viewer not only to perceive the world and reality with heightened senses, but to also experience the consolations of art in the face of what is often unspeakable with respect to existence‚Äîa function of the aesthetic to which Nietzsche and Adorno made reference. The dialectic of presence and absence as well as forgetting and remembering plays a major role in her work. It is a constant that runs through her entire oeuvre in various forms‚Äîfrom verschwinden (Disappear, 1999) and Briefe (Letters, 2001) to zu Tisch (At Table, 2011) and the video ...das gr√∂sste Gl√ºck, welches vorstellbar ist (The Greatest Happiness Imaginable, 2010), a work about the mathematician Grigori Perelman. In verschwinden, in a way that is as simple as it is emphatic the theme takes shape in the form of a series of mirrors. Depending on the direction of reception, they allow the viewer's image to sharply come forward or recede. The work zu Tisch, which Ursula Neugebauer developed as an installation, a performance, and a video, is a work that deals with remembrance and memory into which the viewer is actively included. The character of a ‚Äúmemorial during one‚Äôs lifetime‚Äù (Michael Stoeber) is also inscribed into her hair drawings figur (Figure), portraits made out of human hair. It is a work in progress she began in 1996 and into which she included Muslim women who cover their hair in 2007. The film that was produced in this context, Haare (Hair, 2008) sheds light on the phenomenon of religiously motivated veiling as an expression of presence and absence, of the identity and integrity of the female body: here the cloth features as a metaphor for unlived life. Her series Nachlass (Estate, 2003), in which she took photographs of people who have died, also unites features of the portrait with a work that deals with memory. Neugebauer caused a sensation with the space- consuming installation tour en l‚Äôair (1997/98), which featured in numerous exhibitions, in which she animates red ball gowns in a ‚Äúballet without ballerinas‚Äù (Manfred Schneckenburger). An electric motor and a timer cause them to awaken into a passionate dance, only to subsequently collapse in exhaustion.

The specific recognition is mediated by the N-terminal domain of La, which comprises a La motif and an RNA recognition motif (RRM). The La motif adopts an alpha/beta fold that comprises a winged-helix motif. Homologous La domain-containing proteins have been identified in a wide range of organisms except Archaea, bacteria and viruses.

In June 1990 he was sentenced to life imprisonment at Maghaberry for helping the Provisional IRA kill colleague Brian Armour two years previously. He was also accused by former Ulster Defence Association (UDA) leader Andy Tyrie of complicity in UDA South Belfast brigadier John McMichael's death in 1987. McMichael was blown up by a booby-trap bomb placed underneath his car. According to Tyrie, Hanna gathered information about McMichael when the latter visited loyalist inmates. Hanna in his turn passed on the information to local Belfast actress, Rosena Brown with whom Hanna was infatuated. Brown, dubbed the \\"IRA Mata Hari\\", served as an Intelligence Officer of the IRA. Hanna also passed on information about Armour to Brown, who was named at Hanna's trial. Hanna was part of an IRA plan to stage a massive prison escape using weapons and explosives smuggled in by prison officers. The plan did not come to fruition. Alleged former IRA member Sean O'Callaghan, who became an informer for the Garda S√≠och√°na, was a fellow inmate of Hanna whilst both were serving their respective sentences at Maghaberry. He described him as an \\"extremely dangerous and irrational man\\". Hanna died of cancer at the age of 45.

In 1971, he joined the prison service. According to Sean O'Callaghan, Hanna's former inmate at Maghaberry, he was already a member of the illegal loyalist paramilitary organisation, the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF).O'Callaghan, Sean (1999). The Informer. Great Britain: Corgi Books. p.340 He allegedly helped the UVF to smuggle a bomb inside the Crumlin Road Gaol in order to kill an IRA prisoner. The plan failed; however, O'Callaghan alleged that he continued to collaborate with the UVF, Ulster Defence Association (UDA), IRA, as well as working for the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) Special Branch. He was sent to the Maze Prison, on the outskirts of Lisburn, where he became one of the prison's highest-ranking officers. Northern Ireland's 3,000 prison officers were responsible for \\"the most dangerous prison population in Europe\\". A government report admitted that a large number of the officers were speedily recruited in the 1970s and that as result, their \\"quality was patchy\\".Geraghty, Tony (1998). The Irish War: the hidden conflict between the IRA and British Intelligence.

The plan, which involved a proposed escape of at least 25 IRA prisoners, failed to come to fruition. Sean O'Callaghan suggested that he colluded with the IRA yet kept RUC Special Branch informed of all that went on. Former UDA commander Andy Tyrie alleged that he passed on information to the IRA regarding the movements of UDA South Belfast brigadier John McMichael to facilitate his assassination.

It is located in western √âquateur province, in the Bomongo, Bikoro and Makanza territories, and covers a total area of . It extends northward from the confluence of the Congo River and the Ubangi River. According to the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) the reserve will conserve biodiversity and the ecosystem in the Ngiri triangle. History It was first proposed to make the Ngiri triangle, the area between the Ubangi, Congo and Ngiri rivers, into a reserve in 1975, but the project could not be completed. The project was revived by the WWF in the context of Lake Tele - Lake Tumba landscape project, of which the Tumba-Ngiri-Maindombe wetland is the DRC portion. It was proposed that the new reserve should be IUCN category VI. In August 2010, the Cooperation Agreement between the governments of the Republic of the Congo and the DRC on the Lake Tele - Lake Tumba landscape provided for creation of the Ngiri reserve as well the Mabali scientific reserve in addition to the Tumba- Lediima Reserve in the DRC and the Lake T√©l√© Community Reserve in the Republic of the Congo. The Ngiri reserve was created by a decree of the Ministry of Environment in March 2011, with the participation of WWF. Environment The reserve is mostly covered by swamp forest, and contains many streams and rivers. The Ngiri River flows from north to south through the center of the reserve before joining the Ubangi. A wide zone bordering the Ngiri consists of alternating marshy grassland-savanna, swamp forests and seasonally flooded forests. The savanna is burned in the dry season. At other times it is flooded. Common tree species are Entandrophragma palustre, Coelocaryon botryoides, Uapaca heudelotii, Guibourtia demeusei and Oubanguia africana. Rainfall is relatively constant throughout the year, averaging , but is slightly heavier from August to October and lighter in April and May. The Ubangi and Ngiri water levels are highest from September to November, while the Congo has highest water levels from October to December. The reserve is a breeding ground for large numbers of water birds, particularly purple herons, reed cormorants and African darters. During the low-water periods rosy bee- eaters and African river martins breed in the reserve. It is the only location in the DRC where Congo sunbirds have been found. Vulnerable African bush elephants are present, and Allen's swamp monkeys are thought to be present. The region has a very sparse human population engaged mainly in fishing and hunting. Most settlements are near to Bomongo, the only town in the reserve. The capital of √âquateur province, Mbandaka, lies to the south of the reserve where the Tshuapa River enters the Congo from the east.

Harford County Airport is a general aviation (GA) airport in northern Maryland that serves primarily recreational pilots. There are three runways at Harford, two grass/turf and one paved. The popular runway in the summer time is the grass runway 01/19. However, in November, the turf is closed as the grass generally remains wet and soggy over the winter months. The diagonal turf runway 14/32 is rarely used by powered pilots except during high crosswind conditions. The prevailing winds generally vary between favoring 28 and 19. The airport has a large sailplane/glider contingent and is home of the Atlantic Soaring Club. The airport serves some commercial activities, mainly sight seeing and flight training (through Harford Air Services) as well as biplane rides and hot air balloons (run by Light Flight Balloons www.fun-flying.com). In the Spring of 2012 a Skydiving company, Skydive Baltimore, moved their operations from Ridgley and started operations at the airport.  Harford Air Services  Harford Air is the sole FBO at Harford County Airport. They offer sight seeing, flight training, and aircraft rental. Their flight school provides training for the Private Pilots License, Instrument Rating, Commercial License, Flight Instructor, and Tailwheel training including ground school in the spring and fall. They have six aircraft available for rent three Cessna 172s including two 'S' models and one 'M' model, a Piper Arrow, a Bellanca Citabria, and a Cessna 162 Skycatcher.

They offer tandem skydiving and own a Cessna C-208 Caravan and three Cessna 182 airplanes.  Airport upgrades  The airport is currently going through the process to obtain the necessary permits to enable a generalized expansion. This expansion is aimed at increasing the overall safety of the airport and to attract new business into the surrounding area. The airport expansion will consist of eliminating two of the three existing runways and extending the length of one of its runways to just over 3,000 ft. This will allow aircraft to arrive and depart on a safer longer runway, while simultaneously reducing noise for the surrounding community. This expansion will also promote increased business revenue for many of the shops and restaurants in Bel Air, Churchville, Aberdeen, and Edgewood, and will serve as convenient access to those visiting the Aberdeen Proving Grounds. On April 14, 2015, a judge ruled against a zoning appeal to stop the airport expansion. The new runway will be long by wide and be oriented in a north-south direction.

The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \\"In classic Gossip Girl fashion, the 100th episode was full of witty one-liners, many of them from the mouth of Georgina Sparks and one in honor of The Princess Bride; paid homage to the pilot; and featured several head-turning moments.\\" Ology gave the episode a 9/10 grade. Digital Spy writer Catriona Wightman found the episode \\"completely absurd\\" but \\"brillantly entertaining.\\" Morgan Glennon of BuddyTV wrote, \\"Despite how ridiculous it was seeing character after character after character try to save Blair from her own stupid decisions, Gossip Girl really knows how to do big events. After 100 episodes, the show understood that it needed to go big to top off the royal wedding storyline. So the wedding, and attendant quest to stop it, was as big, dramatic and heartfelt as Gossip Girl at its best.\\" Glennon also conceded about the Gossip Girl reveal, the show can still pull out those OMG moments. Glennon found Georgina \\"amazing\\" in the episode, \\"you can't even take your eyes off her because she's so great in every scene.\\" However, The Atlantic Wire thought the writers \\"should have waited until the last-ever episode to do the unveiling\\" of Gossip Girl and questioned, \\"isn't that indicative of the show's greater failings over these past four and a half years?

Air behaves in a wave like manner, meaning particles naturally flow from areas of higher pressure to those where the pressure is lower. Atmospheric differenceAtmospheric air pressure is directly related to altitude, temperature, and composition. In engineering, airflow is a measurement of the amount of air per unit of time that flows through a particular device. The flow of air can be induced through mechanical means (such as by operating an electric or manual fan) or can take place passively, as a function of pressure differentials present in the environment.  Types of airflow  Like any fluid, air may exhibit both laminar and turbulent flow patterns. Laminar flow occurs when air can flow smoothly, and exhibits a parabolic velocity profile; turbulent flow occurs when there is an irregularity (such as a disruption in the surface across which the fluid is flowing), which alters the direction of movement. Turbulent flow exhibits a flat velocity profile.ASHRAE, ed. ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals 2017. Atlanta, GA: American Society of Heating, Air-Conditioning and Refrigeration Engineers, 2017. The Reynolds number, a ratio indicating the relationship between viscous and inertial forces in a fluid, can be used to predict the transition from laminar to turbulent flow. This number and related concepts can be applied to studying flow in systems of all scales. The speed at which a fluid flows past an object varies with distance from the object's surface. The region surrounding an object where the air speed approaches zero is known as the boundary layer. It is here that surface friction most affects flow; irregularities in surfaces may affect boundary layer thickness, and hence act to disrupt flow. Units Typical units to express airflow are: =By volume= * l/s (litres per second) * m3/h (cubic metres per hour) * ft3/hr (cubic feet per hour) =By mass= * kg/s (kilograms per second) Airflow can also be described in terms of air changes per hour (ACH), indicating full replacement of the volume of air filling the space in question. Measurement The instrument that measures airflow is called an airflow meter. Anemometers are also used to measure wind speed and indoor airflow. There are a variety of types, including straight probe anemometers, designed to measure air velocity, differential pressure, temperature, and humidity; rotating vane anemometers, used for measuring air velocity and volumetric flow; and hot-sphere anemometers. Anemometers may use ultrasound or resistive wire to measure the energy transfer between the measurement device and the passing particles. A hot-wire anemometer, for example, registers decreases in wire temperature, which can be translated into airflow velocity by analyzing the rate of change. Some tools are capable of calculating air flow, wet bulb temperature, dew point, and turbulence.  Simulation  Air flow can be simulated using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling, or observed experimentally through the operation of a wind tunnel. This may be used to predict airflow patterns around automobiles, aircraft, and marine craft, as well as air penetration of a building envelope. Control One type of equipment that regulates the airflow in ducts is called a damper. The damper can be used to increase, decrease or completely stop the flow of air. A more complex device that can not only regulate the airflow but also has the ability to generate and condition airflow is an air handler. Uses Measuring the airflow is necessary in many applications such as ventilation (to determine how much air is being replaced), pneumatic conveying (to control the air velocity and phase of transport) and engines (to control the Air‚Äìfuel ratio). Aerodynamics is the branch of fluid dynamics (physics) that is specifically concerned with the measurement, simulation, and control of airflow. Managing airflow is of concern to many fields, including meteorology, aeronautics, medicine, mechanical engineering, civil engineering, environmental engineering and building science.  Airflow in buildings  In building science, airflow is often addressed in terms of its desirability, for example in contrasting ventilation and infiltration. Ventilation is defined as the desired flow of fresh outdoor supply air to another, typically indoor, space, along with the simultaneous expulsion of exhaust air from indoors to the outdoors. This may be achieved through mechanical means or through passive strategies (also known as natural ventilation). By contrast, air infiltration is characterized as the uncontrolled influx of air through an inadequately-sealed building envelope, usually coupled with unintentional leakage of conditioned air from the interior of a building to the exterior.Axley, James W. ‚ÄúResidential Passive Ventilation Systems: Evaluation and Design.‚Äù Air Infiltration and Ventilation Center, Tech Note 54 (2001). Buildings may be ventilated using mechanical systems, passive systems or strategies, or a combination of the two.Schiavon, S. (2014), Adventitious ventilation: a new definition for an old mode?. Indoor Air, 24: 557‚Äì558. doi:10.1111/ina.12155 = Airflow in mechanical ventilation systems (HVAC) = Mechanical ventilation uses fans to induce flow of air into and through a building. Duct configuration and assembly affect air flow rates through the system. Dampers, valves, joints and other geometrical or material changes within a duct can lead to flow losses. = Passive strategies for maximizing airflow = Passive ventilation strategies take advantage of inherent characteristics of air, specifically thermal buoyancy and pressure differentials, to evacuate exhaust air from within a building. Stack effect equates to using chimneys or similar tall spaces with openings near the top to passively draw exhaust air up and out of the space, thanks to the fact that air will rise when its temperature increases (as the volume increases and pressure decreases). Wind-driven passive ventilation relies on building configuration, orientation, and aperture distribution to take advantage of outdoor air movement. Cross-ventilation requires strategically-positioned openings aligned with local wind patterns. = Relationship of air movement to thermal comfort and overall Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) = Airflow is a factor of concern when designing to meet occupant thermal comfort standards (such as ASHRAE 55). Varying rates of air movement may positively or negatively impact individuals‚Äô perception of warmth or coolness, and hence their comfort.Toftum, J√∏rn. ‚ÄúAir Movement‚Äìgood or Bad?‚Äù Indoor Air 14 (2004): 40‚Äì45. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0668.2004.00271.x. Air velocity interacts with air temperature, relative humidity, radiant temperature of surrounding surfaces and occupants, and occupant skin conductivity, resulting in particular thermal sensations. Sufficient, properly-controlled and designed airflow (ventilation) is important for overall Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) and Indoor Air Quality (IAQ), in that it provides the necessary supply of fresh air and effectively evacuates exhaust air.

Arthur Patrick L. \\"Pat\\" Quinlan (1883‚Äì1948) was an Irish trade union organizer, journalist, and socialist political activist. Quinlan is best remembered for the part he played as an organizer for the Industrial Workers of the World in the 1913 Paterson silk strike ‚Äî an event which led to his imprisonment for two years in the New Jersey State Penitentiary. Biography =Early years= Arthur Patrick L. QuinlanSolon DeLeon, with Irma C. Hayssen and Grace Poole (eds.), The American Labor Who's Who. New York: Hanford Press, 1925; pg. 190. ‚Äî known to history as Patrick and to his friends as \\"Pat\\" ‚Äî was born February 23, 1883 in the town of Kilmallock in the southern part of County Limerick, Ireland.Anne Huber Tripp, The IWW and the Paterson Silk Strike of 1913. Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1987; pg. 84. He was the son of a farmer and dry goods merchant who emigrated to the United States of America with his family in 1887. Quinlan was sent back to Ireland as a boy with a view to his being educated for the priesthood, and he consequently remained apart from his family in America until his early teens. In 1900 Quinlan returned to the USA. There he worked variously as a coal miner, steel worker, teamster, machinist, grocery clerk, sailor, and a longshoreman, among other occupations. During his time on the New Jersey docks, Quinlan joined the Longshoreman's Protective Association, part of the Socialist Trade and Labor Alliance, the trade union wing of the Socialist Labor Party of America (SLP). This lead Quinlan to membership in the Marxist SLP itself, in which he was a member of Section Newark, New Jersey. During this time he formed a close political association with radical Irish socialist James Connolly ‚Äî a key leader of the 1916 Easter Uprising who would be executed by the British government in the revolt's aftermath. In 1907 and 1908 Quinlan worked closely with Connolly on the defense committee working on behalf of persecuted Industrial Workers of the World leaders Bill Haywood, Charles Moyer, and George Pettibone and together they attempted to establish an Irish Socialist Federation inside the SLP.Tripp, The IWW and the Paterson Silk Strike of 1913, pg. 85. Quinlan was also part of the effort at this time by the New Jersey SLP to broker organizational unity with the rival Socialist Party of America (SPA). When the SLP's dominant leader, party editor Daniel DeLeon took a hostile stance to both an Irish SLP Federation and to organizational unity with the SPA, Quinlan exited the former organization in favor of the latter. Quinlan was regarded as an effective soapbox orator and formal public speaker, a person capable of winning audiences over with a sarcastic and intense delivery style. In 1910 this ability was put to use by the Socialist Party in a professional capacity when Quinlan was enlisted as a paid organizer for the party for the states of Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and New York. =1913 Paterson silk strike= 1913 Paterson Silk Strike leaders Patrick L. Quinlan, Carlo Tresca, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, Adolph Lessig, and Big Bill Haywood. In 1912 Quinlan was named as a traveling organizer for the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). It was in this capacity that he became involved in one of that organization's most highly publicized actions, a massive strike of silk workers in Paterson, New Jersey in 1913. The strike began on the morning of Tuesday, February 25, 1913. In accordance with a prearranged plan, at 8 am between 4,000 and 5,000 Paterson mill workers simultaneously walked off the job, forming an informal parade to Paterson's Turn Hall, where a mass meeting was scheduled.Tripp, The IWW and the Paterson Silk Strike of 1913, pg. 68. Along with IWW organizers Carlo Tresca and Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, Quinlan was slated to address the 2,000 or so workers who managed to make their way to this event. This gathering was interrupted by Paterson chief of police John Bimson, who ordered the meeting to disperse and arrested the three IWW organizers. The trio were offered the chance to avoid prosecution by immediately leaving the city ‚Äî a choice which was declined.Tripp, The IWW and the Paterson Silk Strike of 1913, pg. 69. Despite the peaceful nature of the strike meeting, Quinlan, Flynn, and Tresca were consequently charged with inciting a riot and held on $1,000 bail. After spending a night in jail, Quinlan was released on bail and returned to his strike organizing activities. The Paterson strike was long, costly, and bitter and the \\"outside agitators\\" of the IWW were particularly targeted by law enforcement authorities and mill owners looking to break the strikers. On April 25, 1913 a grand jury returned an indictment against Quinlan and four other top IWW leaders, a charge related to Quinlan's speech at Turn Hall on the first day of the strike.Tripp, The IWW and the Paterson Silk Strike of 1913, pg. 117. Formal charges against Quinlan included inciting personal injury, inciting assault, and advocating burning and destruction. Quinlan was arrested again and a new bail of $7,000 was established. Quinlan was arraigned along with Big Bill Haywood, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, Carlo Tresca, and Adolph Lessig on Wednesday, April 30. Quinlan was selected by authorities to go to trial first on the basis of a perceived likelihood of his conviction.Tripp, The IWW and the Paterson Silk Strike of 1913, pg. 121. On May 7, 1913, Quinlan's trial began, with a large crowd assembling outside the Passaic County Courthouse in Paterson to cheer Quinlan and other IWW leaders and boo the police \\"in a manner not unlike a sports event.\\"The phrase is that of historian Anne Huber Tripp. See: Tripp, The IWW and the Paterson Silk Strike of 1913, pg. 121. Jury selection occupied the morning and the trial commenced in an afternoon session.Tripp, The IWW and the Paterson Silk Strike of 1913, pg. 122. Seven witnesses, headed by a police detective sergeant, gave testimony that Quinlan had told the assembled strikers at Turn Hall to leave their jobs \\"by any means necessary.\\" In his own defense, confirmed by other witnesses, Quinlan indicated that he had not addressed the gathering at all, arriving only after police had broken up the meeting. Summations took place on May 9, with Quinlan's attorney declaring the case to be \\"a police frame-up, pure and simple.\\" County Prosecutor Michael Dunn, on the other hand, likened Quinlan to the McNamara Brothers, convicted of a fatal bombing in connection with a Los Angeles iron workers' strike. Quinlan's case ended in a mistrial, with the jury hopelessly deadlocked with 7 in favor of acquittal and 5 voting to convict.Tripp, The IWW and the Paterson Silk Strike of 1913, pg. 123. The mistrial did not result in Quinlan's freedom, however, and just two days after the conclusion of the first trial a second trial against Quinlan was begun. A jury was hastily selected for the second Quinlan trial, with the selection process completed in less than an hour. The same exact case was presented by the prosecution, while the defense bolstered its case with a New York clergyman and prominent lawyer testifying to Quinlan's good character, as well as a local journalist who swore that Quinlan had not spoken at the February 25 meeting in question at Turn Hall. Nevertheless, in the retrial Quinlan was found guilty as charged by the speedily-picked jury after just two hours of deliberations. No Paterson newspaper criticized the dubious Quinlan verdict, which was further applauded editorially by The Nation magazine and The New York Times.Tripp, The IWW and the Paterson Silk Strike of 1913, pg. 124. On Thursday, July 3, 1913, with cases against the other IWW defendants at last concluded, Quinlan went before Judge Abram Klenert for sentencing.Tripp, The IWW and the Paterson Silk Strike of 1913, pg. 165. Klenert sentenced Quinlan to 2 to 7 years in Trenton State Prison and fined him $500 on the basis of his conviction. No release pending appeal was allowed and the following Monday Quinlan was taken to Trenton to begin serving what would be two years behind bars. =After prison= Upon his release, Quinlan's complaints about the dire conditions associated with the state's penitentiary system were instrumental in causing an investigative commission to be established. This commission brought about some modest reform of the system, including the abolition of the contract labor system in which prisoners would be rented out as virtual slaves to private capitalists. The defeat of the 1913 Paterson strike moved Quinlan back into the camp believing in the necessity of political action, bringing him into conflict with leaders of the IWW.Steve Golin, The Fragile Bridge: Paterson Silk Strike, 1913. Philadelphia, PA: Temple University Press, 1988; pg. 214. The strike's loss effectively ended a period of close cooperation between the Wobblies and the Socialist Party and upon reaching that fork in the road, Quinlan chose to chart his course with the latter. Active in the Socialist Party of New Jersey, state affiliate of the SPA, Quinlan was elected a delegate to the SPA's 1917 Emergency National Convention,\\"Delegates to the 1917 Convention of the Socialist Party of America,\\" Marxists.org, www.marxists.org/. a gathering in St. Louis which established the party's opposition to American participation in World War I, and to the 1919 Emergency National Convention which saw the formal split of the party into Socialist and Communist wings.\\"Delegates to the 1919 Emergency Convention of the Socialist Party of America,\\" Marxists.org, www.marxists.org/. Quinlan was also a member of the International Longshoremen's Association from 1917 to 1919. He returned to turbulent Europe in the fall of 1919, spending the next two years visiting Northern and Central Europe as well as Soviet Russia. In 1920 he attended an International Congress of Transportation Workers in Christiania (Oslo), Norway. Quinlan proceeded to Soviet Russia, where he attended the 2nd World Congress of the Communist International. Quinlan was afforded status as a voting delegate at that gathering, representing the Labour Party of Ireland.John Riddell (ed.), Workers of the World and Oppressed Peoples, Unite! Proceedings and Documents of the Second Congress, 1920: Volume 2. New York: Pathfinder Press, 1991; pg. 841. Quinlan returned to America in 1921, moving to Buffalo, New York, to assume the editorship of the Socialist Party newspaper there, The New Age. He remained in this capacity until 1923. Among the new features appearing in the paper after Quinlan's assumption of the editorship around the first of October 1921 was a recurring editorial page section containing brief, pithy, politically charged barbs, entitled \\"Small Shot, by Patsy O'Bang.\\"Quinlan's \\"Small Shot, by Patsy O'Bang\\" column launched in The New Age, October 13, 1921, pg. 8. =Later years= By 1941, Quinlan had become editor of the Gaelic American, a weekly publication associated with the Sinn F√©in. In this capacity Quinlan was supportive of the activities of the American Committee for Protection of Foreign Born, a mass organization of the American Communist Party.Special Committee on Un-American Activities, House of Representatives, Investigation of Un-American Propaganda Activities in the United States: Appendix ‚Äî Part IX: Communist Front Organizations with Special Reference to the National Citizens Political Action Committee.

(‡Æ™‡ØÅ‡Æ±‡ÆÆ‡Øç: 192) To us all towns are our own, everyone our kin, Life's good comes not from others' gifts, nor ill, Pains and pain's relief are from within, Death's no new thing, nor do our bosoms thrill When joyous life seems like a luscious draught. When grieved, we patient suffer; for, we deem This much-praised life of ours a fragile raft Borne down the waters of some mountain stream That o'er huge boulders roaring seeks the plain Tho' storms with lightning's flash from darkened skies. Descend, the raft goes on as fates ordain. Thus have we seen in visions of the wise! We marvel not at the greatness of the great; Still less despise we men of low estate. Kaniyan Poongundran, Purananuru - 192 (Adapted from translation by G.U.Pope, 1906) Cosmopolitanism Poongundranar rejected division of mankind into various categories and emphasised the universality of all humans. The Tamil bards and intellectuals of the time of Poongundranar and those preceding his age considered that all humans, whatever their rank or station in life, were alike. Natural law Poongundranar states that the wooden log is carried by the water in its direction and similarly postulates that everything in life will also follow Natural law. This he calls 'Way of Order'(). =Principles of the Way of Order= Throughout his poem, Poongundranar lays down the principles of his version of natural law. The first part of the poem deals with the basic principles of the 'Way of Order'() which is his term for natural law. *Every human of every town is of the same value because they are ‡Æï‡Øá‡Æ≥‡Æø‡Æ∞‡Øç (related). Hence, all people should be bound by one, same moral and legal code. *‡Æ®‡Æ©‡Øç‡Æ±‡ØÅ (good) and ‡Æ§‡ØÄ‡Æ§‡ØÅ (evil) do not come from others. Hence, humans are liable for both the pleasure and suffering they feel. *Death is a natural part of the cycle of life, it is not new. Hence, this life must be made use of to its full potential. *Yet, life should neither be full of pleasure (‡ÆÆ‡Æï‡Æø‡Æ¥‡Øç‡Æö‡Øç‡Æö‡Æø), nor full of storms (‡Æ™‡ØÅ‡ÆØ‡Æ≤‡Øç) [of suffering]. Hence, life should be full of plenitude. =Allegory of the raft= Poongundranar further goes onto explain these principles with an example of a raft. *He compares birth to lightning, suggesting it can happen spontaneously anywhere. *He gives an example of a raft which is allegorical to human life going downstream a steep hill, having a perilous journey through boulders and faces its climax just as in ‡Æ§‡Æø‡Æ±‡Æµ‡Øã‡Æ∞‡Øç ‡Æï‡Ææ‡Æü‡Øç‡Æö‡Æø‡ÆØ‡Æø‡Æ≤‡Øç (lit. Wisemen's vision means fate) which is death. *He concludes that since everyone's life is like the raft's journey, it is irrational to magnify the ‡Æ™‡ØÜ‡Æ∞‡Æø‡ÆØ‡Øã[‡Æ∞‡Øç] (accomplished people) and even worse to diminish ‡Æö‡Æø‡Æ±‡Æø‡ÆØ‡Øã[‡Æ∞‡Øç](less accomplished people), because everyone goes through similar tribulations whatever their social estate might be. Influence Kaniyan Poongundranar's Yathum oore poem has been declared as the theme song of the 10th World Tamil Conference scheduled in Chicago. American composer Rajan Somasundaram has given the first music form for the 2000-year-old poetry. It has been sung by Academy nominated singer Bombay Jayashri and Karthik (singer) among other international artists.https://www.dinamalar.com/news_detail.asp?id=2290362 Poongundranar was extremely influential in the revivalist Self-respect movement.

They were issued under the general title of Fables in several volumes from 1668 to 1694 and are considered classics of French literature. Humorous, nuanced and ironical, they were originally aimed at adults but then entered the educational system and were required learning for school children. Composition history Divided into 12 books, there are 239 of the Fables, varying in length from a few lines to some hundred, those written later being as a rule longer than those written earlier. The first collection of Fables Choisies had appeared March 31, 1668, dividing 124 fables into six books over its two volumes. They were dedicated to \\"Monseigneur\\" Louis, le Grand Dauphin, the six-year-old son of Louis XIV of France and his queen consort Maria Theresa of Spain. By this time, La Fontaine was 47 and known to readers chiefly as the author of Contes, lively stories in verse, grazing and sometimes transgressing the bounds of contemporary moral standards. The Fables, in contrast, were completely in compliance with these standards. Eight new fables published in 1671 would eventually take their place in books 7‚Äì9 of the second collection. Books 7 and 8 appeared in 1678, while 9-11 appeared in 1679, the whole 87 fables being dedicated to the king's mistress, Madame de Montespan. Between 1682 and 1685 a few fables were published dealing with people in antiquity, such as \\"The Matron of Ephesus\\" and \\"Philemon and Baucis\\". Then book 12 appeared as a separate volume in 1694, containing 29 fables dedicated to the king's 12-year-old grandchild, Louis, Duke of Burgundy. Plot sources An Aubusson tapestry from the 18th century illustrating \\"The Lion in Love\\" The first six books, collected in 1668, were in the main adapted from the classical fabulists Aesop, Babrius and Phaedrus. In these, La Fontaine adhered to the path of his predecessors with some closeness; but in the later collections he allowed himself far more liberty and in the later books there is a wider range of sources. In the later books, the so-called Indian Bidpai is drawn upon for oriental fables that had come to the French through translations from Persian. The most likely source for La Fontaine was the pseudonymous version by Gilbert Gaulmin (1585‚Äì1665) under the title The book of Enlightenment or the Conduct of Kings (; 1644). Another translation by Father Pierre Poussines appeared in 1666 with the Latin title Specimen sapientiae Indorum veterum (A sample of ancient Indian wisdom). With a genealogy going back to the Indian Panchatantra, they were then attributed to Bidpai (Pilpay), who is given more than his fair due by La Fontaine in the preface to his second collection of Fables: \\"I must acknowledge that I owe the greatest part to Pilpay, the Indian sage.\\" ()Wikisource His sources are in fact much more diverse and by no means mainly oriental; of 89 fables, no more than twenty are found in Bidpai's collection.A. Tilley, \\"La Fontaine and Bidpai,\\" The Modern Language Review 34.1 (Jan., 1939), p. 21; online Avienus and Horace are also drawn upon in the later books along with the earlier French writers Rabelais, Cl√©ment Marot, Mathurin R√©gnier and Bonaventure des P√©riers. Boccaccio, Ariosto, Tasso and Machiavelli's comedies were also sources. Contemporary happenings, too, were occasionally turned to account, as for instance an accident at the funeral of M. de Boufflers (vii, II). No fable, so far as appears, is of La Fontaine's invention, and La Fontaine had many predecessors in the genre, especially in the beast fable. Content Facsimile of the manuscript of \\"The Sculptor and the Statue of Jupiter\\" The subject of each of the Fables is often common property of many ages and races. What gives La Fontaine's Fables their rare distinction is the freshness in narration, the deftness of touch, the unconstrained suppleness of metrical structure, the unfailing humor of the pointed moral, the consummate art of their apparent artlessness. Keen insight into the foibles of human nature is found throughout, but in the later books ingenuity is employed to make the fable cover, yet convey, social doctrines and sympathies more democratic than the age would have tolerated in unmasked expression. Almost from the start, the Fables entered French literary consciousness to a greater degree than any other classic of its literature. For generations many of these little apologues have been read, committed to memory, recited, paraphrased, by every French school child. Countless phrases from them are current idioms, and familiarity with them is assumed. \\"La Fontaine's Fables\\", wrote Madame de S√©vign√©, \\"are like a basket of strawberries. You begin by selecting the largest and best, but, little by little, you eat first one, then another, till at last the basket is empty\\". Silvestre de Sacy has commented that they supply delights to three different ages: the child rejoices in the freshness and vividness of the story, the eager student of literature in the consummate art with which it is told, the experienced man of the world in the subtle reflections on character and life which it conveys. Nor has any one, with the exception of a few paradoxers like Rousseau and a few sentimentalists like Lamartine, denied that the moral tone of the whole is as fresh and healthy as its literary interest is vivid. The book has therefore naturally become a standard French reader both at home and abroad. Lamartine, who preferred classic regularity in verse, could find in the Fables only \\"limping, disjointed, unequal verses, without symmetry either to the ear or on the page\\". But the poets of the Romantic School Hugo, Musset, Gautier and their fellows, found in the popular favor these verses had attained an incentive to undertake an emancipation of French prosody which they in large measure achieved. Reaching children When he first wrote his Fables, La Fontaine had a sophisticated audience in mind. Nevertheless, the Fables were regarded as providing an excellent education in morals for children, and the first edition was dedicated to the six-year-old Dauphin. Following La Fontaine's example, his translator Charles Denis dedicated his Select Fables (1754) to the sixteen-year-old heir to the English throne. The 18th century was particularly distinguished for the number of fabulists in all languages and for the special cultivation of young people as a target audience. In the 1730s eight volumes of Nouvelles Po√©sies Spirituelles et Morales sur les plus beaux airs were published, the first six of which incorporated a section of fables aimed at children. These contained fables of La Fontaine rewritten to fit popular airs of the day and arranged for simple performance. The preface to this work announces that its aim is specifically to \\"give them an attraction to useful lessons which are suited to their age [and] an aversion to the profane songs which are often put into their mouths and which only serve to corrupt their innocence\\".John Metz, The Fables of La Fontaine, a critical edition of the 18th century settings, New York 1986, pp.3‚Äì10; available on Google Books The practical lesson of \\"The frog that wanted to be as big as an ox\\" on a 19th-century trade card This was in the context of getting the young people of the family to perform at social gatherings. Eventually the fables were learned by heart for such entertainments and afterwards they were adopted by the education system, not least as linguistic models as well. Reinforcing the work were illustrated editions, trade cards issued with chocolateThere is a selection on and meat extract products,A set for \\"The miller, his son and the ass\\" in the Mus√©e La Fontaine postcards with the picture on one side and the poem on the other, and illustrated chinaware. There have also been television series based on the fables. In Canada there was the 1958 Fables of La Fontaine series and in France Les Fables g√©om√©triques between 1989‚Äì91. In England the bulk of children's writing concentrated on Aesop's fables rather than La Fontaine's adaptations. The boundary lines began to be blurred in compilations that mixed Aesop's fables with those from other sources. The middle section of \\"Modern Fables\\" in Robert Dodsley's Select Fables of Esop and other fabulists (1764) contains many from La Fontaine. These are in prose but Charles Denis' earlier collection was in verse and several authors writing poems specifically for children in the early 19th century also included versions of La Fontaine. Although there had been earlier complete translations in verse at the start of that century, the most popular was Elizur Wright's The Fables of La Fontaine, first published in Boston in 1841 with prints by Grandville. This went through several editions, both in the United States and in Britain. Other children's editions, in both prose and verse, were published in the 20th century.

Herbert held land as an under-tenant of the Archbishop of York in the Domesday Survey of 1089. He held the office of chamberlain of the Winchester treasury during the reign of King William II of England, and the office of chancellor and treasurer under King Henry I.Hollister \\"Origins of the English Treasury\\", English Historical Review p. 268 During William II's reign, Herbert became a tenant-in-chief, holding lands directly from the king. Herbert may have been a member of the clergy, although it is known that he was married.Barlow William Rufus p. 149 Most sources state that Herbert married Emma, half-sister of King Stephen and Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester,Greenway Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300: Volume 6: York: List 1: Archbishops and that she was an illegitimate daughter of Stephen II, Count of Blois, Stephen's father.Davis, King Stephen, pp. 172‚Äì173 New research, however, suggests that Emma might have been a daughter of Hunger fitzOdin, who held lands in Dorset in the Domesday survey.Burton \\"William of York\\" \\"Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\\"Norton St. William of York p. 207 Herbert was the father of Herbert and William. William later became Archbishop of York.Keats-Rohan Domesday People p. 250 The younger Herbert became chamberlain to King David I of Scotland around 1156.Keats-Rohan Domesday Descendants p. 199 Herbert was probably dead by 1129‚Äì1130, when the Pipe Roll of 1130 records his son as owing a fine for the inheritance of his father's lands, a fine totalling over 353 marks, perhaps as much as 500. However, there is no certain record of Herbert after 1111, and it is possible that he should be considered the same person as \\"H. the Chamberlain\\", who Abbot Suger of St Denis named as an attempted assassin of Henry I in 1118, and who was punished by the king for the attempt. Suger stated that the would-be-assassin was a chamberlain whose name began with \\"H\\", and who had been close to the king and received great rewards from the king. Suger added that the king only blinded and castrated the man, which the abbot considered to be mild compared with the hanging that the man deserved. William of Malmesbury does not name the assassin either, but relates that he had custody of the royal treasury. The historian C. Warren Hollister first made the identification between \\"H.\\" and Herbert, noting that there was only one chamberlain in King Henry I's reign who had a name beginning with \\"H\\". The main argument against the identification is the fact that most records considered that Herbert remained in office until close to 1129 or 1130. However, charter evidence supports the inheritance of Herbert's lands by his son before 1121.Hollister Henry I p. 256 Citations References    Category:Anglo-Normans ","title":"Herbert of Winchester"},{"id":"34545769","text":"Events in the year 1871 in Argentina.

At the beginning of the Heian period uji no ch≈çja was used most often. History The Uji formed a decentralized ruling structure. According to Chinese records, the clans divided in rising urban centers occupied the Yamato Plains (the region between the present-day cities of Nara and Osaka). The clans were responsible for the protection and the taxation of these independent territories. Each clan was ruled by a headman or warlord and worshiped its own unique Ujigami or clan spirit. The most thorough ancient description of the Uji clan system comes from early Chinese records during the Kofun or Tomb period (300‚Äì552 CE) .Lu, David. (1997). Japan: A Documentary History The Dawn of History to the Late Tokugawa Period, p. 9. As pointed out in the History of Wei, the peace was preserved among the Wa people as long as a queen, who was a member of the powerful Yamato clan, played the role of mediator between the various clans. Since pre-classical Japan lacked a centralized government, an official language and a written body of laws, the Shinto religious beliefs determined the hereditary lineage of the Uji members.From the Wei zhi, as reproduced in the original Chinese text, Shinwa kara Rekishi e (From Myths to History): Chuo Koronsha, Nihon no Rekishi ( A history of Japan), Vol. 1 (1965), pp. 214‚Äì220. The powerful Yamato clan, the Japanese Imperial family, consolidated its power during the late sixth and early seventh century, Prince Shotoku, created the Seventeen Article Constitution in 604 CE.

United States, 343 U.S. 1 (1952), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court upheld the convictions of five attorneys for contempt of court.. Belknap (1994), p 225.  Background  The five attorneys who volunteered to defend the communists in the Smith Act trial of 1949 were familiar with leftist causes and personally supported the defendants' rights to espouse communist views. They were Abraham Isserman, George W. Crockett, Jr., Richard Gladstein, Harry Sacher, and Louis F. McCabe.Sabin, p 42. Attorney Maurice Sugar participated in an advisory role.\\"Communist Trial Ends with 11 Guilty\\", Life, October 24, 1949, p 31. Defendant Eugene Dennis represented himself. The ACLU was dominated by anti-communist leaders during the 1940s, and did not enthusiastically support persons indicted under the Smith Act. However, the ACLU did provide an amicus brief for the Foley Square defendants, endorsing a motion for dismissal.Walker, pp 185-187\\\\. However, many local affiliates of the ACLU supported communist defendants. The defense deliberately antagonized the judge by making a large number of objections and motions,Morgan, p 314. Sabin, p 41. which led to numerous bitter engagements between the attorneys and Judge Medina.Redish, p 82. Sabin, p 46. Out of the chaos, an atmosphere of \\"mutual hostility\\" arose between the judge and attorneys.Sabin, p 46. Medina came to believe that the defense attorneys were using the trial as an opportunity to publicize communist propaganda, and that they deliberately disrupted the trial using any means they could.Redish, p 82. Judge Medina attempted to maintain order by removing defendants who were out of order. In the course of the trial, Medina sent five of the defendants to jail for outbursts, including Hall because he shouted \\"I've heard more law in a Kangaroo court\\", and Winstonan African Americanfor shouting \\"more than five thousand Negroes have been lynched in this country\\".Sabin, pp 46-47\\\\. Sabin writes that only four defendants were cited. Morgan, p 315 (Morgan erroneously quotes Winston as saying 500the correct quote is 5,000). Martelle, p 175. Several times in July and August, the judge held defense attorneys in contempt of court, and told them their punishment would be meted out upon conclusion of the trial.Martelle, p 190. Legal scholar Michal Belknap writes that Medina was \\"unfriendly\\" to the defense, and that \\"there is reason to believe that Medina was biased against the defendants\\", citing a statement Medina made during pretrial activity: \\"If we let them do that sort of thing [postpone the trial start], they'll destroy the government\\".Belknap (1994), p 212. On page 220 Belknap gives more assertions of Medina's bias. Medina's hostility towards the defense may have been exacerbated by the fact that another federal judge had recently died of a heart attack during a similar trial involving the Smith Act;Belknap (2001), p 860. and Medina came to believe that the defense was deliberately trying to provoke him with the goal of achieving a mistrial.Belknap (1994), p 220. Belknap asserts that the defendants could \\"insist with complete justification that they were the targets of a political prosecution\\", and that \\"rather than attempting to prove eleven individuals guilty of criminal conduct, the prosecution mounted an attack on the CPUSA.\\"Belknap (1994), p 214. Legal scholar Arthur Sabin writes that one of the jurors stated that \\"we must fight communism to the death\\" and spoke of his desire to \\"hang those Commies\\".Walker, p 185. Sabin, pp 44-45\\\\. Juror quoted by Sabin is novelist Russell Janney. See also Martelle, pp 189-193. Immediately after the jury rendered a verdict, Medina turned to the defense attorneys saying he had some \\"unfinished business\\" and he held them in contempt of court, and sentenced all of themincluding future Congressman George W. Crockett, Jr.to jail terms ranging from 30 days to six months.Defendant Dennis, acting as his own attorney during the 1949 trial, also received a six-month contempt sentence. Attorney Maurice Sugar, who participated in an advisory role, was not cited for contempt. The attorneys had no opportunity to respond, and were immediately handcuffed and led to jail.Sabin, p 47.Some of the contempt sentences were postponed pending appeal; for instance, Crockett served four months in an Ashland, Kentucky Federal prison in 1952. See Smith, Jessie Carney, Notable Black American Men, Volume 1, Gale, 1998, p 236, .  Opinion of the Court  The defense attorneys appealed their own contempt sentences, which were handed out by Judge Medina under Rule 42 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.Rule 42(a), Fed.Rules Crim.Proc., 18 U.S.C.A. The attorneys raised a variety of issues on appeal, including the alleged misconduct of the judge, and the allegation that they were deprived of due process because there was no hearing to evaluate the merits of the contempt charge. The attorneys also argued that such contempt convictions would prevent future defendants from obtaining counsel, because attorneys would be afraid of judicial retaliation.From Sacher: \\"We are urged that these sentences will have an intimidating effect on the legal profession, whose members hereafter will decline to appear in trials where 'defendants are objects of hostility of those in power,' or will do so under a 'cloud of fear' which \\"threatens the right of the American people to be represented fearlessly and vigorously by counsel.\\" The attorneys' initial appeal to the federal appeals court was not successful: the court reviewed the Medina's actions, and reversed some specifications of contempt, but affirmed the convictions. The attorneys then appealed to the Supreme Court which denied the initial petition, but later reconsidered and accepted the appeal.The initial appeal was 341 U.S. 952, 71 S.Ct. 1010, 95 L.Ed. 1374. The Supreme Court limited their review to the question \\"was the charge of contempt, as and when certified, one which the accusing judge was authorized under Rule 42(a) to determine and punish himself; or was it one to be adjudged and punished under Rule 42(b) only by a judge other than the accusing one and after notice, hearing, and opportunity to defend?\\". The Supreme Court, in an opinion written by Justice Jackson, upheld the contempt sentences by a 5-3 vote.Belknap (1994), pp 224-225. Jackson's opinion stated that \\"summary punishment always, and rightly, is regarded with disfavor, and, if imposed in passion or pettiness, brings discredit to a court as certainly as the conduct it penalizes. But the very practical reasons which have led every system of law to vest a contempt power in one who presides over judicial proceedings also are the reasons which account for it being made summary.\\"  See also  *Clear and present danger *Imminent lawless action *List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 343 *Shouting fire in a crowded theater *Threatening the President of the United States *Abrams v.

Branching may occur randomly or reactions may be designed so that specific architectures are targeted. It is an important microstructural feature. A polymer's architecture affects many of its physical properties including solution viscosity, melt viscosity, solubility in various solvents, glass transition temperature and the size of individual polymer coils in solution. Different polymer architectures Various polymer architectures. =Random branching= Branches can form when the growing end of a polymer molecule reaches either (a) back around onto itself or (b) onto another polymer chain, both of which, via abstraction of a hydrogen, can create a mid-chain growth site. Branching can be quantified by the branching index. =Cross linked polymer= An effect related to branching is chemical crosslinking - the formation of covalent bonds between chains. Crosslinking tends to increase Tg and increase strength and toughness. Among other applications, this process is used to strengthen rubbers in a process known as vulcanization, which is based on crosslinking by sulfur. Car tires, for example, are highly crosslinked in order to reduce the leaking of air out of the tire and to toughen their durability. Eraser rubber, on the other hand, is not crosslinked to allow flaking of the rubber and prevent damage to the paper. Polymerization of pure sulfur at higher temperatures also explains why sulfur becomes more viscous with elevated temperatures in its molten state.C.Michael Hogan. 2011. sulfur. Encyclopedia of Earth, eds. A.Jorgensen and C.J.Cleveland, National Council for Science and the environment, Washington DC A polymer molecule with a high degree of crosslinking is referred to as a polymer network. A sufficiently high crosslink to chain ratio may lead to the formation of a so-called infinite network or gel, in which each chain is connected to at least one other.Painter, pp. 96-100 =Complex architectures= With the continual development of Living polymerization, the synthesis of polymers with specific architectures becomes more and more facile. Architectures such as star polymers, comb polymers, brush polymers, dendronized polymers, dendrimers and Ring polymers are possible. Complex architecture polymers can be synthesized either with the use of specially tailored starting compounds or by first synthesising linear chains which undergo further reactions to become connected together. Knotted polymers consist of multiple intramolecular cyclization units within a single polymer chain. Effect of architecture on physical properties In general, the higher degree of branching, the more compact a polymer chain is. Branching also affects chain entanglement, the ability of chains to slide past one another, in turn affecting the bulk physical properties. Long chain branches may increase polymer strength, toughness, and the glass transition temperature (Tg) due to an increase in the number of entanglements per chain. A random and short chain length between branches, on the other hand, may reduce polymer strength due to disruption of the chains' ability to interact with each other or crystallize. An example of the effect of branching on physical properties can be found in polyethylene. High-density polyethylene (HDPE) has a very low degree of branching, is relatively stiff, and is used in applications such as bullet-proof vests. Low-density polyethylene (LDPE), on the other hand, has significant numbers of both long and short branches, is relatively flexible, and is used in applications such as plastic films. Dendrimer and dendron Dendrimers are a special case of branched polymer where every monomer unit is also a branch point. This tends to reduce intermolecular chain entanglement and crystallization. A related architecture, the dendritic polymer, are not perfectly branched but share similar properties to dendrimers due to their high degree of branching. The degree of branching that occurs during polymerisation can be influenced by the functionality of the monomers that are used. For example, in a free radical polymerisation of styrene, addition of divinylbenzene, which has a functionality of 2, will result in the formation of branched polymer.

Like today, criteriums were an important part of professional cycling. Whilst not part of the televised Kelloggs, the races attracted a star-studded field and huge crowds. Five editions were held during the 1980s. The first edition of the race was won by Roger Willett from Finchfield, who later rode for the Great Britain senior team. The undisputed king of the Stafford Town Centre Races was Steve Joughin. As a local rider who settled in Stoke-on-Trent at the start of his professional career and riding for local sponsors Moducel. Joughin was undefeated in the 3 editions of the race in which he competed. The last Stafford Town Centre race took place in 1987 and was won by Mark Walsham.  Today  A criterium race was revived in Stafford in 2010 by Leadout Cycling Ltd. The Stafford GP has been part of the British Cycling Elite Circuit Race Series, a series of races held usually in mid week across towns in England. Since its reincarnation there have been 8 editions of the race. The 2010 race was won by Olympic champion Ed Clancy. The 2011 edition was won by Australian Dean Windsor. The 2012 saw Graham Briggs take the victory - one of his 5 victories on the way to the 2012 Elite Circuit Race Series title. In 2013 the race became part of the Staffordshire Cycling Festival.

In 1990, Polly Peck collapsed following an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office and charges were brought against Asil Nadir on 70 counts of false accounting and theft, which he denied. From 1993 until 2010 Nadir lived in northern Cyprus, having fled there to escape a trial in the UK. He remained a fugitive from British justice until 26 August 2010, when he returned to London to face trial. His trial commenced at the Old Bailey on 3 September 2010, on 13 specimen charges of false accounting and theft totalling ¬£34m. He was found guilty of 10 counts of theft totalling ¬£29m and on 23 August 2012 was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Early life Nadir was born in 1941 in Lefka, Cyprus. His father, Irfan Nadir, was a local businessman and police constable in the colonial police department. When he was six years old he began selling newspapers, and he moved with his family to London in the 1950s when his father expanded the family clothing business from a base in the East End of London.  Career  Nadir studied economics at Istanbul University, but returned to Cyprus before graduation to set up a clothing business. He returned to London in the 1960s, but after the invasion by Turkey of northern Cyprus in 1974, accepted the appeal of the authorities to bolster the new region economically. The Turkish occupation enabled him to take over a Greek-Cypriot owned clothing factory in Nicosia, where he greatly expanded exports to the Middle East. =Polly Peck= In the late 1970s he purchased a small British textile company, Polly Peck, which he turned into a portfolio company with which to make various corporate raiding purchases in clothing, fruit packing and later consumer electronics. Through this he came to prominence in the 1980s as a tycoon and the CEO of an organisation by then with over 24,000 shareholders and interests ranging from produce to electronics. Within a decade, Nadir had built Peck from almost nothing into a member of the FTSE 100. His alleged criminal mismanagement led to its collapse in 1990. Escape to northern Cyprus Nadir was prosecuted on various counts of theft and fraud, amounting to 66 charges, but failed to appear at the trial in 1993 having travelled to the unrecognised Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, which has no extradition treaty with the United Kingdom, where he resided until 2010. Although a UK arrest warrant was subsequently issued for his breach of bail, it was not valid due to procedural reasons. In a 2003 interview with the BBC, Nadir vowed to return to the UK to attempt to clear his name. However, he said that he was fearful of the consequences to his health and refused to go back until the British government agreed to give him bail and not remand him in prison until his trial. On 26 August 2010, having provided bail of ¬£250,000 and secured an agreement to not be remanded in prison until his trial, he returned to the UK. Peter Dimond, the pilot who flew Nadir out of the UK from Compton Abbas Airfield in a twin-engined private plane, was jailed for two years in August 1998 for committing an act intended to pervert the course of justice, but he was freed by the Court of Appeal in January 1999 when it quashed the conviction after it was discovered that Nadir was not technically on bail at the time of his escape as his bail had lapsed. Later career Nadir ran a business in northern Cyprus called the Kƒ±brƒ±s Media Group, which inter alia publishes the newspaper Kƒ±brƒ±s (Turkish for 'Cyprus') and the English language weekly Cyprus Today. It also owns a radio and TV station. Nadir's outlets published articles critical of the Republican Turkish Party/Reform Party coalition government in the run-up to the April 2009 general election and actively supported the then opposition National Unity Party and Democratic Party. On 12 March 2009 Kƒ±brƒ±s Media Group was suddenly presented with a tax demand in the amount of 11 million Turkish Lira ($6.3 million) payable the following day, on pain of the sequestration of its assets. Leading opposition politicians branded this action as an attempt to gag the free media. The edition of 14 March 2009 of Cyprus Today appeared as usual. Ministers subsequently awarded him a multimillion-euro contract to operate Lefkoniko Airport in northern Cyprus. Return to UK On 30 July 2010 it was reported that a British judge had granted Nadir bail, which it was said would pave the way for him to return to the UK to face trial. On 26 August 2010, Nadir returned to the UK with his wife Nur in a private Boeing 737 aircraft, leased from Onur Airlines, to face trial. His bail conditions included the ¬£250,000 bail surety already paid to the court, surrendering his passport, wearing an electronic tag, reporting to a police station once a week, and being prohibited from going near any airport. He appeared at the Old Bailey on 3 September 2010 to comply with bail conditions. Nadir stayed in a ¬£20,000-a-month rented house. Owing to the complexity of the allegations, his trial did not begin until 23 January 2012. On 22 August 2012, Asil Nadir was found guilty on ten counts of theft of nearly ¬£29m from Polly Peck. The jury found him not guilty on three counts. The jury had been advised at the start of the trial that the 13 were specimen charges and the overall amount allegedly stolen was about ¬£146m. He was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment. Transferred to Turkey In April 2016, Asil Nadir was transferred to a Turkish prison. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: \\"It is right that foreign criminals are properly punished but not at the expense of British taxpayers. This government is committed to removing foreign criminals to their own countries. Since Asil Nadir has now repaid the ¬£2 million he owed the Legal Aid Agency, plus ¬£5 million in compensation he paid earlier, arrangements were made with the Turkish government for his removal as part of the Prisoner Transfer Agreement.\\" Once back in Turkey, Nadir was only held for one day in prison before being released. Personal life Nadir was born to a Turkish Cypriot family.

Although the school is called a secondary school, it offers classes for grades one through eleven. The school courses are taught in Uzbek. Toktogul Secondary School was established in 1936. Currently the school has two buildings. The old building was completed in 1947. In 2007, a wing of the old building was seriously damaged by an earthquake. A new two-story building was constructed in 2009.  General framework and curriculum  At Isfana School, children are accepted to first grade at the age of six or seven, depending on the child's individual development. The eleven-year school term is split into elementary (grades 1-4), middle (grades 5-9) and senior (grades 10-11) classes. Attending a \\"basic\\" nine-year (elementary and middle) program is compulsory. Grades 10-11 are optional. As in many parts of the country, at Toktogul Secondary School children of elementary classes are normally separated from other classes within their own floor of the school building. They are taught, ideally, by a single teacher through all four elementary grades (except for physical education and foreign languages). Starting from the fifth grade, each academic subject is taught by a dedicated specialty teacher. The school curriculum for senior students includes subjects like mathematics, informatics, physics, chemistry, geography, biology, arts, music, physical education, history, and astronomy. Like many other schools in Kyrgyzstan, Toktogul Secondary School is a double shift school where two streams of students (morning shift and evening shift) share the same facility. The reason for this is that school capacity is insufficient to teach all of the students on a normal, morning-to-afternoon, schedule. The school year extends from the beginning of September to the end of May and is divided into four terms. The school curriculum at Toktogul Secondary School is fixed: unlike in some Western countries, schoolchildren cannot choose what subjects to study. Students are graded on a five-step scale, ranging in practice from 2 (\\"unacceptable\\") to 5 (\\"excellent\\"); 1 is a rarely used sign of extreme failure. Teachers regularly subdivide these grades (i.e. 4+, 5-) in daily use, but term and year results are graded strictly 2, 3, 4, or 5.  Medium of instruction  The medium of instruction at Toktogul Secondary School is Uzbek. In addition to Uzbek, students also study three other languages, namely English, Kyrgyz, and Russian. Like in many other Uzbek-language schools in Kyrgyzstan, the future of teaching in Uzbek remains uncertain at Toktogul Secondary School. Following the 2010 South Kyrgyzstan ethnic clashes, Kyrgyz authorities started to take measures to remove the Uzbek language from public life and to forcibly switch Uzbek schools to Kyrgyz. As part of these efforts, the number of teaching hours allocated to Kyrgyz language and literature lessons at Uzbek schools was significantly increased at the expense of Uzbek language and literature lessons. Currently there are not enough school textbooks in Uzbek and the Kyrgyz government is unwilling to provide them, claiming that it does not have enough funds. As Kyrgyz officials strongly oppose the use of textbooks printed in Uzbekistan, currently the majority of Uzbek schoolchildren in Kyrgyzstan, including the students of Toktogul Secondary School study in Uzbek using Kyrgyz textbooks.

The historic district contains a well-preserved collection of American Foursquare houses that were built starting in 1902 and continued until 1915. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 2000. It was part of The Bungalow and Square House--Des Moines Residential Growth and Development MPS. History The historic district lies north of Kingman Boulevard and south of Cottage Grove Avenue, between 27th Street on the east and 31st Street on the west. It is composed of three full blocks and parts of two others in the Kingman and University plats. The plats are unique in Des Moines as they are oriented east to west as opposed to north to south. with Because it developed within a few years it is composed of similar foursquare house plans. It has very few bungalows, which were also being built in Des Moines at the same time. Cottage Grove Avenue was named in 1872 and the Cottage Grove Addition was platted that autumn. It was located between Cottage Grove and University Avenues and 21st and 23rd Streets. Nothing was developed until the University Land Company organized in 1881 and founded Drake University the same year. Houses began to be built in the area in the 1880s. A hack line was established at the same time and streetcar lines were extended the following decade. The Kingman Addition was platted by the Vermont Land Company in 1889. Brick paving on Cottage Grove began in 1889 and the area was annexed to the city of Des Moines a year later. The paving of Cottage Grove was extended west to 34th Street in 1891 and sewer lines were added in 1894. No houses were added to the district until after 1900. Explosive growth started in University Place in 1904. One of Des Moines‚Äô first suburban banks was built in the area the same year. Around 200 houses were built in the area between 1900 and 1910. There were three definitive house building spurts in the Kingman Place Historic District in 1905, 1910 and 1915. The hip roof subtype of the foursquare house plan was dominate in 1905 and receded significantly by 1915, when front and side gabled roofs took over. Architecture The Kingman Place Historic District is primarily composed of three subtypes of square house plans. Of the 66 square house plans in the district, 34 are four squares, 22 follow the front gable plan and 10 are side gable houses. The rest of the houses in the district represent a number of other styles, including the bungalow. Two of the houses are known as foursquare look-alikes that were built earlier from the others and feature Victorian architectural elements such as a wrap-around porch. Their room counts were also higher than eight, which are typical of the four squares.

Reversal test The reversal test was introduced in the context of the bioethics of human enhancement by Nick Bostrom and Toby Ord. Given that humans might suffer from irrational status quo bias, how can one distinguish between valid criticisms of proposed increase in some human trait and criticisms merely motivated by resistance to change? The reversal test attempts to do this by asking whether it would be a good thing if the trait was decreased: An example given is that if someone objects that an increase in intelligence would be a bad thing due to more dangerous weapons being made etc., the objector to that position would then ask \\"Shouldn't we decrease intelligence then?\\" > \\"Reversal Test: When a proposal to change a certain parameter is thought to > have bad overall consequences, consider a change to the same parameter in > the opposite direction.

If they are unable to do so, then we have reason to suspect that > they suffer from status quo bias.\\" (p. 664) Ideally the test will help reveal whether status quo bias is an important causal factor in the initial judgement.

Kolber, imagining whether aliens naturally resistant to traumatic memories should adopt traumatic \\"memory enhancement\\". The \\"trip to reality\\" rebuttal to Nozick's experience machine thought experiment (where one's entire current life is shown to be a simulation and one is offered to return to reality) can also be seen as a form of reversal test. Double reversal test A further elaboration on the reversal test is suggested as the double reversal test: > \\"Double Reversal Test: Suppose it is thought that increasing a certain > parameter and decreasing it would both have bad overall consequences. > Consider a scenario in which a natural factor threatens to move the > parameter in one direction and ask whether it would be good to > counterbalance this change by an intervention to preserve the status quo. If > so, consider a later time when the naturally occurring factor is about to > vanish and ask whether it would be a good idea to intervene to reverse the > first intervention. If not, then there is a strong prima facie case for > thinking that it would be good to make the first intervention even in the > absence of the natural countervailing factor.\\" (p. 673) As an example, consider the parameter to be life expectancy, moving in the downward direction because of a sudden natural disease. We might intervene to invest in better health infrastructure to preserve the current life expectancy. Now if the disease is cured, the double reversal test asks: should we reverse our investment and defund the health services we created since the disease, now that it's gone? If not, perhaps we should invest in health infrastructure even if there never is a disease in the first place. In this case the status quo bias is turned against itself, greatly reducing its impact on the reasoning. It also purports to handles arguments of evolutionary adaptation, transition costs, risk, and societal ethics that can counter the other test. Criticism Alfred Nordmann argues that the reversal test merely erects a straw-man argument in favour of enhancement. He claims that the tests are limited to approaches that are consequentialist and deontological. He adds that one cannot view humans as sets of parameters that can be optimized separately or without regard to their history. Christian Weidemann argues that the double reversal test can muddy the water; guaranteeing and weighing transition costs versus benefits might be the relevant practical ethical question for much human enhancement analysis.Weidemann, Christian.

Claudius arrived in the Cape Colony from Batavia in 1682 to paint plants of medicinal interest. He joined Ensign Olof Bergh's second expedition in 1683 to Namaqualand in a quest to locate the source of rich copper ore. It is thought that two years later he also joined Governor Simon van der Stel who had the same goal, and that he was responsible for the illustrations in an account of the expedition. He is also regarded as one of the artists contributing to Jacob Breyne's Exoticarum aliarumque minus cognitarum plantarum centuria prima. In all, the Africana Museum in Johannesburg acquired some 433 original watercolours ascribed to him. His work is also held by the South African Library in Cape Town, the British Museum, the library of Trinity College in Dublin and the University library of Marburg in Hesse. Many of the Claudius paintings were copied at the Cape in 1692 for Nicolaes Witsen, Mayor of Amsterdam, who included the copies in his Codex Witsenii. Most of what is known about Claudius stems from his 1685 meeting with the visiting French Jesuit missionary, Father Guy Tachard. After seeing two large volumes of his works, Tachard ventured that Claudius was a competent painter of plants and animals, and that if the books had been for sale he would have purchased them for Louis XIV of France. Some of his further and rather indiscreet revelations in Voyage de Siam led to Claudius' deportation to Mauritius and Batavia by Simon van der Stel - Tachard wrote \\"It is from him that we obtained all our knowledge of the country. He gave us a little map made by his own hand.\\" This, during a period when the Dutch occupiers of the Cape were extremely suspicious of the French and their designs on the southern tip of Africa.Standard Encyclopaedia of Southern Africa vol.3 - Frank Bradlow References External links *Codex Witsenii Category:Natural history illustrators ","title":"Hendrik Claudius"},{"id":"34546659","text":"The Theater des Westens (Theatre of the West) is one of the most famous theatres for musicals and operettas in Berlin, Germany, located at 10‚Äì12 in Charlottenburg. It was founded in 1895 for plays. The present house was opened in 1896 and dedicated to opera and operetta. Enrico Caruso made his debut in Berlin here, and the Ballets Russes appeared with Anna Pavlova. In the 1930s it was run as the Volkstheater Berlin. After World War II it served as the temporary opera house of Berlin, the St√§dtische Oper (Municipal Opera). In 1961 it became the first theatre in Germany to show musicals. Since then it has become the \\"German equivalent of Broadway extravaganzas\\", putting on plays and musical comedies. History The theatre was founded in 1895. The construction of the present building began in 1896, designed by . It was opened on 1 October 1896 with a fairy tale, Holger Drachmann's Tausendundeine Nacht. From 1898 the house was used for opera, from 1908 for operetta. Enrico Caruso's first appearance in Berlin was in 1905 in Theater des Westens. In 1910, Diaghilev's Ballets Russes performed Carnaval on Schumann's music in a choreography by Mikhail Fokine. Anna Pavlova appeared with the Ballets Russes in 1914. From 1922, the house was again used as an opera house, called \\"Gro√üe Volksoper\\" (Great People's Opera), under the direction of conductor Leo Blech. Short lived, the opera house closed in 1924. The theatre then showed a mixed program, under frequently changing management. The dancer Mary Wigman and her company were a great success in 1926. Hans L√ºppsch√ºtz took over, presenting traditional works including Die Fledermaus and Alt Heidelberg along with new productions. He engaged prominent actors, such as Fritzi Massary in Eine Frau von Format (1927) by , Max Adalbert in Das Ekel (1928) and Josephine Baker in Bitte Einsteigen (1928). From 1921, the cabaret theatre in the basement was directed by Trude Hesterberg. It was closed in 1928, but reopened in 1931 by Friedrich Hollaender as . Performers included Marlene Dietrich, Curt Bois, Bertolt Brecht, Erich M√ºhsam and Theo Lingen. The theatre was reopened on 23 December 1934 as the with Albert Lortzing's Der Waffenschmied. It presented as part of \\"\\" (light entertainment), directed by Karl J√∂ken and his wife Edith Schollwer. Examples include performances such as , , and . It had to be closed after an air raid in 1944. St√§dtische Oper After World War II the building served as Berlin's opera house called , because the Deutsche Oper Berlin had been destroyed in 1943. On 4 September 1945 it was opened by a performance of Beethoven's Fidelio. The General Manager was Michael Bohnen, succeeded by Heinz Tietjen. Ferenc Fricsay was the Musical Director from 1948 to 1952, singers included Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Elisabeth Gr√ºmmer, Josef Greindl and Ernst Haefliger. Operas by Werner Egk, Boris Blacher and Luigi Nono were premiered during this time, including Hans Werner Henze's on 23 September 1956. Musical Program My Fair Lady, 1961, beginning of musicals in Germany When the opera was moved to a new building in 1961, the Theater des Westens specialised in operettas and the new musical. The opening and first musical production was Loewe's My Fair Lady on 1 October 1961, This first performance of the work in German was conducted by Franz Allers who had already conducted the world premiere, the leading roles were performed by Karin H√ºbner and Paul Hubschmid. In 1978, the stage technology was improved. In 1981, a restoration of the interior was begun according to the architectural plans of Bernhard Sehring, the facade was restored in 1988. From 1984, G√∂tz Friedrich was intendant and Helmut Baumann artistic director. They concentrated on musicals and were successful with Guys and Dolls and La Cage aux Folles. In 1988 Friedrich staged Porgy and Bess with an \\"all black-opera\\". In a united Germany, the theatre faced strong competition and had difficulties in staging an attractive program. On 24 September 2002, the Senate of Berlin agreed to sell the theatre to Stage Entertainment, while the ownership of the building itself remained in the city. Renovations which began in January 2003 were estimated to have cost 10 million Euros. On 26 September 2003 the theatre opened again with Les Mis√©rables. Stage Entertainment has no ensemble but presents productions of German and international companies.

Eichler, P. Gunter, and D. W. Pohl, Laser-Induced Dynamic Gratings. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1986. Many FRS experiments have been carried out on thermal and mass diffusion in liquids, and thermophoresis (Soret effect) has been measured in polymer solutions. The FRS method employs the interference fringes of two absorbed coherent ‚Äúpump‚Äù laser beams within the sample to create a spatially sinusoidal variation in the temperature and, if dye molecules are present, the population of long- lived excited dye states. A third ‚Äúprobe‚Äù laser is incident at a wavelength at which the (complex) index of refraction n is different in the bright and dark regions of the interference pattern, so that the periodic variation in n serves as a diffraction grating for the probe beam. A photodetector is used to measure the diffracted light, and after the pump beams are turned off, the detected signal decays at an exponential rate proportional to the relevant diffusion coefficient(s). FRS studies of molecular mass diffusion are somewhat more involved than studies of thermal diffusion or thermophoresis because the ground and excited dye states may have different diffusion coefficients. When this is the case, two gratings differing in phase by 180 degrees are present: the excited state grating and a complementary ground-state grating. The diffracted signal is then a combination of two exponential decays rather than one. Although unique determination of the two separate diffusion coefficients is not easy, the average of the two diffusion coefficients can be obtained from the diffracted signal without difficulty.

Because of a congenital malformation of his feet, however, he did not follow a normal pattern of secondary education. Aged only 17 he attended Oxford University where he took a doctorate in philosophy, and grew interested in hypnotism, becoming a member of Frederic W. H. Myers' Society for Psychical Research. He also became interested in experimental psychology under the influence of William McDougall, and spent some time studying it in W≈±rzburg before joining Charles Spearman at the University of London.O.

The department collects, analyzes, and disseminates information on economic issues under the guidance of the Commission on Economics relevant to the practice of pathology and laboratory medicine, and other related medical issues. Some of the topics that fall under the purview of the department are CPT coding and relative values, practice expense, APCs, Medicare regulations, managed care, national payment policy, and local coverage decisions. The department maintains liaison with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and private payers, as well as the CPT Editorial Panel and the Relative Value Update Committee. Political Action Committee PathPAC‚Äôs growth in size and presence is very important as Congress will address many issues affecting pathology such as specimen reimbursement; Medicare reform; patient safety; medical liability. It is critical for pathology as a profession to have its voice heard on Capitol Hill through a bipartisan political action committee that supports Members of Congress and candidates running for Congress who are helpful to the pathology community. ACP Career Center The ACP also hosts the ACP Career Center, one of the largest job sites specifically for pathologists. Employers are carefully screened and recruiters are not allowed, making the ACP Career Center the best place to find a job. The site is meant to be a \\"user-friendly meeting place for individual employers and job seekers.\\" In addition to the online resources, the ACP Career Center also provides an on-site interview service in late November.

It remained in the building from November 2011 until January 2012. The building was owned by UBS, and the squatters were members of the Occupy London protest movement. The building was described by an Occupy London spokesman as \\"a space for political discussion\\". Aims The Bank of Ideas' website stated that its purpose was to host \\"the non-monetary trade of ideas to help solve the pressing economic, social and environmental problems of our time\\" and referred to itself as a \\"public repossession\\". The idea of \\"repossessing\\" bank property, according to one member of the movement, was in response to bank takeovers of households behind on their mortgage payments. Drugs and alcohol were forbidden at the Bank of Ideas, as was all commercial activity. The centre continued to engage in organized meetings, events and actions until about March 2012. History Whiteboard used at Bank of Ideas The building on Sun Street was occupied by protesters from November 2011. It hosted teach-ins and seminars on various social, economic and political issues. Other events included a mock trial of the United Kingdom government for alleged war crimes conducted during the War in Afghanistan, a screening of the BAFTA-winning film How to Start a Revolution and a free performance by the bands Radiohead and Massive Attack. Eviction All seminars and events at the Bank of Ideas were suspended indefinitely after a court approved UBS's request for the organization's eviction on 26 January 2012. The centre was evicted from the site on 30 January 2012. While most people left peacefully, clashes between law enforcement and remaining squatters led to the arrest of one bailiff for assault.

Several of his plays were adapted for the cinema. Early life Born in New York, Stange was the son of the Broadway musical-theatre writer and director Stanislaus Stange. Hugh followed in his father's footsteps, creating and adapting works for the popular theatre. From 1917, he served in the army in World War I. During his military service, he helped to put on entertainments. His first major success as a playwright was with Seventeen in 1918, which he co-wrote with Stannard Mears. The play was based on the novel by Booth Tarkington.Gerald Martin Bordman, Thomas S. Hischak, The Oxford companion to American theatre, Oxford University Press, 2004, p.558. 1920s By the 1920s, Stange was increasingly interested in social realism. According to Theatre Magazine, Stange's plays at this time were influenced by the early work of Eugene O'Neill.Theatre Magazine, Volumes 45-46, The Theatre Magazine Company, 1927, p.26. His play Tin Pan Alley (1924) was a melodrama about infidelity among theatre folk. It was adapted in 1929 as the film New York Nights, starring Norma Talmadge,American Film Institute, The American Film Institute catalog of ion pictures produced in the United States, Part 1, University of California Press, 1997, p.542. The play was updated and filmed a second time in 1984, with Corinne Wahl in the lead role. Similar themes were explored in Veneer (1929), the story of a naive girl who falls for a man with confident veneer, but who turns out to be a worthless braggart. It has been described as a \\"well-written, if downbeat, slice of New York life\\". Joanna Roos and Henry Hull took the leading roles; Spencer Tracy replaced Hull later in the run.Romano Tozzi, Spencer Tracy, Pyramid Publications, p.22. This was also adapted for film, as Young Bride, starring Helen Twelvetrees. 1930s In 1930 he wrote and produced The Long Road, about a soldier in World War I whose wife has a child by another man while he is fighting in France. The Brooklyn Daily Eagle lamented the solemnity of the play, writing that \\"Mr. Stange writes with a face a yard long...The play is a rather sickening display of affected fine feeling\\".Arthur Pollock, \\"The Long Road opens\\", Brooklyn Daily Eagle, September 10, 1932, p.32. In the following year he collaborated with John Golden on After Tomorrow, about a young couple whose marriage is repeatedly delayed. Stange had written the original draft as a tragedy, but Golden gave it a more upbeat character. Knowing Stange's work, the reviewer in Outlook and Independent magazine suspected that before Golden had livened it up, the play would have been \\"terribly terribly sincere with little if any humour to lighten its drab realism\\".Outlook and Independent, Volume 159, The Outlook Company, 1 Jan 1931, p.55. This play was also later filmed. False Dreams, Farewell (1933) was a portmanteau drama in the manner of Grand Hotel, set on board a Titanic-like cruise-liner that was destined to sink on its maiden voyage. His screenplay credits included The Black Camel (1931), a Charlie Chan mystery. Stange also wrote a number of crime-based dramas including Fogbound and Headquarters (subtitled \\"the dramatization of the hidden police records in a famous crime\\"). Mother Sings (1935) was a drama that prefigures Psycho, portraying the lurid story of a boy who grows up to be a murderer after being psychologically poisoned against women by his deranged mother.Gerald Martin Bordman, American theatre: a chronicle of comedy and drama, 1930-1969, Volume 3, Oxford University Press, 1996, p.125.

It served on the Western Front in the First World War and was recreated during the Second World War where it served only in the United Kingdom as a training formation. Origin: 'The Grey Brigade' An invasion scare in 1859 led to the creation of the Volunteer Force and huge enthusiasm for joining local Rifle Volunteer Corps (RVCs).Beckett.Westlake. There were a large number of these units in and around London,Martin.Money Barnes. and the opportunity was taken to group them together for Easter training under the temporary command of officers of the Brigade of Guards stationed in the capital. Initially they were brigaded by the colour of their uniforms ‚Äì scarlet, Rifle green or grey, the latter being a popular colour for RVCs in the 1860s.Bailey & Hollier, pp. 4 & 382.Anon, Civil Service Rifles, p. 42. The Stanhope Memorandum of December 1888 proposed a formal Mobilisation Scheme for Volunteer units throughout the country, which would assemble by brigades at key points in case of war. In peacetime these brigades provided a structure for collective training.Beckett, pp. 135, 185‚Äì6.Dunlop, pp. 60‚Äì1. Under this scheme the units from Westminster, the West End of London and the adjacent suburbs (all in the County of Middlesex) were formed into the South London Brigade. These units had mainly been in the 'Grey Brigade', and the name stuck to the new formation. The staff for the brigade were provided by the Regimental Headquarters of the Scots Guards at Buckingham Gate in London, and its designated place of assembly was at the Guards' Depot at Caterham, where it could take its place in the London Defence Positions. Its composition was as follows:Army List. * HQ: Scots Guards' Orderly Room * Commanding Brigade: The Officer Commanding, Scots Guards * Brigade-Major: The Regimental Adjutant, Scots Guards * 2nd (South Middlesex) Middlesex RVC * 4th (West London) Middlesex RVC * 5th (West Middlesex) Middlesex RVC * 7th (London Scottish) Middlesex RVC * 9th (West Middlesex) Middlesex RVC (attached to 5th) * 12th (Civil Service) Middlesex RVC * 13th (Queen's) Middlesex RVC (Westminster) * 14th (Inns of Court) Middlesex RVC * 20th (Artists) Middlesex RVC * 25th (Bank of England) Middlesex RVC (attached to 12th)Anon, Civil Service Rifles, pp. 19‚Äì20. * 26th Middlesex RVC (attached to 14th) * Supply detachment (later termed an Army Service Corps (ASC) Company) * Bearer Company, Medical Staff Corps The Volunteer Infantry Brigades were reorganised and increased in number in 1906, and by 1907 the South London Brigade had been numbered the 2nd London Brigade and the number of units reduced to six.Westlake, p. 4. Territorial Force When the Territorial Force was created in 1908 under the Haldane Reforms, the existing volunteer units in the London area were brought together into a new London Regiment and organised into two divisions with a full complement of infantry brigades and supporting arms. The former South London Brigade now became the 4th London Brigade in 2nd London Division, still informally known as The Grey Brigade, still commanded by the CO of the Scots Guards, and with the following composition:Maude, pp. 1‚Äì2, 227‚Äì8.Becke, Part 2a, pp. 69‚Äì75.47th Division at Long, Long Trail47th Division (Regimental Warpath) British Army 1914 * 13th (County of London) Battalion, The London Regiment (Princess Louise's Kensington Regiment), headquartered in Kensington (the former 2nd and 4th Middlesex RVCs) * 14th (County of London) Battalion, The London Regiment (London Scottish), headquartered at 59 Buckingham Gate (the former 7th Middlesex RVC). * 15th (County of London) Battalion, The London Regiment (Prince of Wales's Own Civil Service Rifles) headquartered at Somerset House (the former 12th Middlesex RVC). * 16th (County of London) Battalion, The London Regiment (Queen's Westminster Rifles), headquartered at 58 Buckingham Gate (the former 13th Middlesex RVC). * No 2 (4th London Brigade) Company, 2nd London Divisional Train, ASC, headquartered at the Duke of York's Headquarters, Chelsea First World War The outbreak of war on 4 August saw 4th London Brigade at Perham Down on Salisbury Plain, where it had just arrived for its annual training camp with the rest of 2nd London Division. They were immediately recalled to London to complete their mobilisation and by mid-August 4 London Bde had reached its war station round St Albans, Hertfordshire.Maude, pp. 2‚Äì3. The County of London Territorial Force Association immediately began raising '2nd Line' battalions, which quickly led to the formation of a duplicate 2/4th London Brigade (eventually 179th Brigade); consequently 4th London Brigade became 1/4th and its battalions similarly renumbered (1/13th‚Äì1/16th).Maude, p. 287.Becke, Part 2b, pp. 25‚Äì30.60th Division (Long, Long Trail) =Order of Battle= Several of the London battalions were politically well-connected and were selected for overseas service ahead of the bulk of the Territorial Force. Thus the London Scottish, Queen's Westminsters and Kensingtons went to the Western Front as individual battalions attached to the British Expeditionary Force, the London Scottish being the first TF infantry battalion to see action, at Messines on 31 October 1914.Edmonds, pp. 295, 307‚Äì10 and Appendix 4, pp. 487‚Äì88. These battalions were replaced by others from 2nd London Bde of 1st London Division, which had been temporarily broken up.Becke, pp. 141‚Äì47. The following units served in 140 Bde:Maude, p. 227. * 1/6th (City of London) Battalion, The London Regiment (City of London Rifles) joined 5 November 1914; sent drafts to 1/15th and 1/17th Londons on 30 January, and cadre left to merge with 2/6th Londons in 58th (2/1st London) Division on 2 February 1918. * 1/7th (City of London) Battalion, The London Regiment joined 5 November 1914; sent a draft to 1/19th Londons in 141st (5th London) Brigade on 29 January, and cadre left to merge with 2/7th Londons in 58th Division on 2 February 1918. * 1/8th (City of London) Battalion, The London Regiment (Post Office Rifles) joined 6 November 1914; sent a draft to 1/17th Londons and cadre left to merge with 2/8th Londons in 58th Division on 2 February 1918. * 1/15th (County of London) Battalion, The London Regiment (Civil Service Rifles) * 140th Light Trench Mortar Battery formed June 1915. * 2nd London Company ASC became 456th (Horse Transport) Company ASC August 1915. * 1/4th (City of London) Bn London Regiment (Royal Fusiliers) joined 15 November 1915; transferred to 168th (2nd London) Brigade in 56th (1st London) Division on 9 February 1916.Maude, p. 43. * 1/17th (County of London) Battalion, The London Regiment (Poplar and Stepney Rifles) joined from 141st (5th London) Bde 1 February 1918. * 1/21st (County of London) Battalion, The London Regiment (1st Surrey Rifles) joined from 142nd (6th London) Brigade 1 February 1918. * 140th Machine Gun Company formed December 1915; merged into 47th Battalion Machine Gun Corps March 1918. The 1/15th Londons (Civil Service Rifles) was the only prewar battalion of the brigade to serve with it throughout the war. =Service= In October 1914, 2nd London Division was selected for service on the Western Front and progressive training was carried out through the winter. The division embarked for France in March 1915, concentrating round B√©thune. In May the division (already known in France simply as 'The London Division' to distinguish it from the Regular Army 2nd Division) took its place in the line and was designated 47th (1/2nd London) Division, with the brigades numbered consecutively: 4th London became 140th (1/4th London) Brigade.Maude, pp. 11‚Äì19. =Actions= During the war, the brigade was engaged in the following operations:Maude, pp. 239‚Äì40. 1915 * Battle of Aubers Ridge 9 May * Battle of Festubert 15‚Äì25 May * Battle of Loos 25 September‚Äì1 October * Battle of the Hohenzollern Redoubt 13‚Äì19 October 1916 * Vimy Ridge 21 May * Battle of the Somme: ** Battle of Flers-Courcelette 15‚Äì19 September ** Capture of High Wood 15 September ** Battle of the Transloy Ridges 1‚Äì9 October ** Capture of Eaucourt l'Abbaye 1‚Äì3 October ** Attacks on the Butte de Warlencourt 7‚Äì8 October 1917 * Battle of Messines 7‚Äì13 June * 3rd Battle of Ypres: ** Battle of Pilckem Ridge] (in reserve) 31 July‚Äì2 August) ** In the line 18 August‚Äì2 September and 8‚Äì17 September * Battle of Cambrai: ** Capture of Bourlon Wood 28 November ** German counter-attacks 30 November‚Äì3 December Early in 1918 the brigade was completely reorganised (see Order of Battle above) 1918 * 1st Battles of the Somme: ** Battle of St Quentin 21‚Äì23 March ** 1st Battle of Bapaume 24‚Äì25 March ** Battle of the Ancre 5 April * 2nd Battles of the Somme: ** Battle of Albert 22‚Äì23 August ** 2nd Battle of Bapaume 31 August‚Äì3 September * Final Advance in Artois: ** Operations in Artois 2 October‚Äì11 November ** Official Entry into Lille 28 October After the Armistice, 47th Division was engaged in railway repair and then settled down around Bethune to await demobilisation. This began in January, and the last troops left France on 10 May 1919. The brigade was demobilised at Felixstowe in May‚ÄìJune 1919.Maude, p. 211. Interwar years The 47th Division and its formations began to reform in the redesignated Territorial Army in 1920.Maude, p. 212. 140 Bde was reformed with brigade HQ at the Regimental Headquarters of the Irish Guards at Wellington Barracks in Birdcage Walk. Initially the brigade was composed of its original prewar battalions, but in 1921 the Civil Service Rifles merged with the Queen's Westminsters, and the brigade was brought up to strength by the addition of the Artists' Rifles: * 13th London Regiment (Princess Louise's Kensington Regiment). * 14th London Regiment (London Scottish). * 16th London Regiment (Queen's Westminster and Civil Service Rifles), headquartered at 58 Buckingham Gate. * 28th London Regiment (Artists Rifles) headquartered at Duke's Road, Euston. In 1935, a growing number of TA infantry battalions had been converted to the searchlight or anti-aircraft artillery role, and at the end of the year 47th Division was disbanded and converted into 1st Anti-Aircraft Division. 140 Brigade HQ was also disbanded and its battalions dispersed to other London infantry brigades. the 13th and 14th London Regiment both transferred to 2nd London Infantry Brigade, the London Division, previously 56th Division but with the disbandment of 47th Division it was redesignated the London Division. However, the rapid expansion of the TA after the Munich Crisis saw a new 4th London Infantry Brigade reformed with 2nd Line TA battalions, to provide a duplicate of 1st London Infantry Brigade. 4th London Brigade resumed its number as 140 (London) Brigade on 21 November 1940.Joslen, p. 235. Second World War Men of the 2nd Battalion, London Irish Rifles advancing with fixed bayonets after climbing up the cliffs during training at Little Haven near Haverfordwest.

The 140th Infantry Brigade did not see any active service in the Second World War. It mobilised as a motor brigade, but became a conventional infantry brigade in June 1940. It was disbanded on 31 August 1944.Joslen, pp. 41, 235. On 17 November 1944, 213th Brigade (which had recently joined 47th Division, now reformed as a reserve division) was renumbered 140th Infantry Brigade, but without any London connection. The new brigade had the following composition:Joslen, p. 376. * 4th Battalion, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry * 6th Battalion, Royal Sussex Regiment * 7th Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment The brigade was not included in the Territorial Army when it reformed in 1947.Territorial Army 1947 (Orbat.com) Commanders 140 Brigade was commanded by the following officers:Maude, p. 232.Becke, p. 70. * Brig.-Gen.

History =Origin= When the Territorial Force was created in 1908 under the Haldane Reforms, the existing Volunteer units in the London area were brought together into a new London Regiment and organised into two divisions with a full complement of infantry brigades and supporting arms. Four battalions from South London (formerly part of the Surrey Brigade) constituted the 6th London Brigade in 2nd London Division, with the following composition:Maude, pp. 1‚Äì2, 228.Becke, Part 2a, pp. 69‚Äì75.47th Division (Long, Long Trail)47th Division (Regimental Warpath) British Army 1914 * 6th London Brigade Headquarters, Duke of York's Headquarters, Chelsea * 21st (County of London) Battalion, The London Regiment (1st Surrey Rifles), headquartered in Camberwell. * 22nd (County of London) Battalion, The London Regiment (The Queen's), headquartered in Bermondsey. * 23rd (County of London) Battalion, The London Regiment, headquartered in Clapham Junction. * 24th (County of London) Battalion, The London Regiment (The Queen's) headquartered in Kennington. * No 4 (6th London Brigade) Company, 2nd London Divisional Train, Army Service Corps headquartered at the Duke of York's Headquarters =First World War= The outbreak of war on 4 August saw 6th London Brigade at Perham Down on Salisbury Plain, where it had just arrived for its annual training camp with the rest of 2nd London Division. They were immediately recalled to London to complete their mobilisation and by mid-August 6 London Bde had reached its war station round Watford, Hertfordshire.Maude, pp. 2‚Äì3. The County of London Territorial Force Association immediately began raising '2nd Line' battalions, which quickly led to the formation of a duplicate 2/6th London Brigade (eventually 181st Brigade); consequently 6th London Brigade was renumbered 1/6th and its battalions were similarly prefixed (1/21st‚Äì1/24th).Maude, p. 287.Becke, Part 2b, pp. 25‚Äì30.60th Division (Long, Long Trail) In October 1914, 2nd London Division was selected for service on the Western Front and progressive training was carried out through the winter. The division embarked for France in March 1915, concentrating round B√©thune. In May the division (already known in France simply as 'The London Division' to distinguish it from the Regular Army 2nd Division) took its place in the line and was designated 47th (1/2nd London) Division, with the brigades numbered consecutively: 6th London became 142nd (1/6th London) Brigade.Maude, pp. 11‚Äì19. The division suffered casualties from shellfire while holding the line as neighbouring formations fought the Battle of Aubers Ridge, (9 & 15 May),Maude, p. 18. but Heathcote- Drummond-Willoughby's 142 Bde carried out the division's first offensive action, on 25 May during the Battle of Festubert. The attack on the 'S' Bend was timed for 18.30, to precede a Canadian night attack further along the line. The 23rd and 24th Londons swept across the open ground and immediately captured the German front trenches with few losses. However, German listening posts had given warning of the impending attack, and they had registered their artillery onto their own trenches. The divisional historian records that the Londoners now encountered 'a fierce and deadly enfilading fire from the German guns, and particularly from a heavy battery posted near Auchy-les-la Bass√©e, far to the south and out of range of the guns of our Division'.Maude, pp. 19‚Äì20. The brigade supports, 21st Londons, and the 20th Londons from divisional reserve, were brought up and desperate attempts made to extend the brigade's gains, 'but tremendous losses were suffered by the men crowded in the captured trenches. Nothing could be done to keep down this enfilading fire, and by the following morning much of the captured trenches had been knocked to bits and had to be abandoned, but a considerable part of their front line was retained and taken into our own trench system'.

It was co- founded by Air Force Staff Sgt. Jonathan Mills and Capt. Eddy Sweeney, and first published in March 2011, while OutServe was still operating clandestinely prior to the repeal of the \\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\\" policy that banned open gays from service. The Magazine garnered over a quarter of a million views for its most popular issues. The publication was distributed free of charge on military bases, and was available to the public for downloading and redistribution through its website and mobile apps. It published 13 issues over 2 years, employing more than 30 volunteer staff, and was the first gay rights magazine to be approved for distribution on military bases. History In February 2011, OutServe, Inc. launched an initiative for a newsletter that would inform LGBT service members of the fast-growing support network that was available to them, as well as inform readers on the status of DADT and other LGBT-related policies. Jonathan Mills and Eddy Sweeney expanded on this idea and created a bi-monthly magazine that sought to publish relevant information in a pre-DADT repeal environment, inform LGBT service members of various resources available to them, provide a voice for LGBT stakeholders in the military, and begin to normalize open service by introducing the Armed Services to the gay military professional. The first electronic-only issue of the Magazine, distributed in March 2011 to OutServe network members, as well as released to the press, had over 10,000 impressions within the first 48 hours, and was met with an overwhelming show of support from the public, the Department of Defense, and the Obama Administration. News organizations such as MSNBC, CNN, ABC,Der Spiegel, Stars and Stripes, and Military Times reached out to cover the launch. Writers and staff were originally attributed by pseudonyms in order to operate within the confines of DADT. In the months after, the bi-monthly publication shifted its focus from a pre-repeal environment to a post-repeal one, and the September 2011 Repeal Edition had a quarter of a million views. This issue featured, for the first time in any publication, the faces of 101 actively serving LGBT military professionals. The Magazine featured LGBT multimedia essays by artists such as JoAnn Santangelo and Jeff Sheng, published the first public interview with Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Michael Mullen after his retirement (the most senior military leader charged with implementation of DADT repeal), was cited regularly by major news outlets, and partnered with more than 15 advertisers, including CIA, Barefoot Wine, Rhino Africa, MetLife, Amazon, Absolut, Miller Lite, VisitPhilly, Wells Fargo, Human Right Campaign, and Orbitz. From its launch in 2011 to its one-year anniversary in March 2012, OutServe Magazine expanded its staff from 3 to more than 30 volunteers, added a new OutServe Blog, released Android, Windows Phone, and Apple mobile apps, and expanded print and web distribution from 10,000 readers in the first month to over a quarter of a million views in 2013. OutServe Magazine published its final issue in June 2013, under the direction of its final Editor-in-Chief Angelina Leger, one month before OutServe-SLDN's reorganization and the accompanying resignation of several of its leaders. Archived issues can accessed at MagCloud. Repeal Edition In September 2011, its third edition, the \\"Repeal Edition\\", revealed the identity of OutServe Co-director JD Smithas a U.S. Air Force active-duty lieutenant. The \\"Repeal Edition\\" featured 101 service members coming out to the public for the first time. It was also the first edition approved for distribution in print to military installations.

Boxwood Barkentine (born July 1920), an Airedale Terrier, was the Best in Show at the 1922 Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, the third occasion it was awarded to a member of that breed. It was the first show that Barkentine had been entered into as an adult. Early life Barkentine was born in Brookline, Massachusetts in July 1920. His owner and breeder was Frederic C. Newton, who had also bred Barkentine's mother and grandmother. Show history Whilst a puppy, he was entered in two shows held by the Airedale Club of New England, winning the prize for Best Puppy on both occasions. At the age of 20 months, he was entered into the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in his first appearance in adult classes. He first won in the novice category for his breed, qualifying and then taking the title of best dog of his breed and then the Best of Breed title, taking the Airedale Club of America's Airedale Bowl Trophy. He went on to compete in, and win, the James Mortimer Memorial Trophy for best American dog in the show. Then came the Best in Show round. Barkentine competed against a field of fifteen other dogs, including several past Best of Breed winners and an Australian Shepherd which had been shipped from Europe specifically to take part in the show. Ch. Lansdown Sunflower, the Greyhound runner-up from the previous year, and Best in Show at forty nine other mixed breed shows, was amongst those competing for the title. Eight dogs remained after the first cut, including both Barkentine and another Airedale, who were judged together. Other dogs still in which a chance included a Chow Chow named Li Ping Tow and the German Shepherd Dog Dolf von Dusternbrook. The Scottish Terrier Jeannie Deans was eliminated from contention after she tried to bite the German Shepherd. A second cut was made, and it went down to Boxwood Barkentine and Lansdown Sunflower, who remained in the center of the ring as the three judges made their decision. A hurried discussion between the judges was had and was only broken when Mr Muss-Arnot took the winners ribbon from an official and handed it to Barkentine's handler to announce the winner. The Airedale proved a popular choice and the crowd signaled their approval. At the Boston show later in the same month as his win at Westminster, he was beaten by the Wire Fox Terrier Hard Cider in the American bred dogs category. He was beaten once again by Hard Cider in the Best in Show Round. At the Baltimore show in March, Barkentine was defeated for Best in Show by International Weather, an Old English Sheepdog he had beaten in the Best in Show round at Westminster. He won the Airedale Club of America's Airedale Bowl once more at the Eastern Dog Show in 1923.

It is located on Tortugas Mountain, also known locally as 'A' Mountain, in southern New Mexico (USA), approximately southeast of Las Cruces and east of the NMSU campus. Founded in 1963 under the supervision of Clyde Tombaugh, the observatory focused on observing the planets. Much of the information captured at TMO is now available through the Planetary Data System's Atmospheres Node, which is managed by NMSU. The two-dome observatory building was completed in 1964, though observing began with one of the telescopes in 1963. A second building, with a larger single dome, was completed at the opposite end of the ridgeline of Tortugas Mountain in 1967. Regular use of TMO ceased in 1999 or 2000, but the observatory equipment was not dismantled. In 2008 it was used for the Lunar CRater Observing and Sensing Satellite project.

It occurs in the western Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. Description Mulinia lateralis has a somewhat inflated triangular shell, with valves that are thin but not brittle. The shell reaches 15 mm in adult size. The anterior end of the shell is rounded, but the posterior end has a distinctive radial ridge giving it an angular look. The outer surface is white or yellowish and somewhat glossy, covered with fine concentric sculpturing. The beaks are prominent and are slightly angled towards the anterior end. The hinge has a small chondrophore, and the ligament joining the valves is internal. The inner surface of the valves is glossy white.Mulinia lateralis The Bailey-Matthews Shell Museum. Retrieved 2012-01-30. Distribution Mulinia lateralis is found on the eastern coasts of North America from New Jersey southwards to Mexico. It lives shallowly buried in sand or mud on the lower shore and in the sublittoral zone. It is tolerant of low salinities and is found in estuaries and lagoons.Mulinia lateralis Smithsonian Marine Station a Fort Pierce. Retrieved 2012-01-30. It is sometimes abundant, and as many as 21,000 individuals have been found in a square metre. Biology Mulinia lateralis is a filter feeder. The diet is mainly bacteria or other planktonic material. Like other bivalve molluscs, the animal raises its siphons to the surface of the sediment, draws water in though one and expels it through the other, having filtered out nutrient particles in the gills. The sexes are separate in Mulinia lateralis. The female produces up to 2 million eggs at a time, and fertilisation is external. The veliger larvae disperse as part of the zooplankton and take from 1 to 3 weeks to develop into the pediveliger stage, whereupon they settle and undergo metamorphosis. The juveniles grow fast and are sexually mature within 2 months. Ecology A number of different animals prey on Mulinia lateralis. These include birds such as the sanderling and laughing gull and crabs. The gray sea star (Luidia clathrata) selectively feeds on it and the knobbed whelk (Busycon carica) is also a major predator.Knobbed Whelks, Dwarf Clams, and Shorebirds: A Love Story, Told Through Traces Retrieved 2012-01-30. In addition to a variety of salinities, Mulinia lateralis is able to tolerate other ecologically stressful conditions like temperature extremes and anoxia. Mulinia lateralis has been found in the European wadden sea, and has the potential to become an invasive alien species due to its high fecundity, short generation cycle of just 60 days, and broad ecological amplitudes.

It was inaugurated on 27 January 1912, the birthday of German emperor Wilhelm II. The monument honoured the soldiers and civilians that died on the German side of the Herero and Namaqua War of 1904‚Äì1907, a situation that caused controversy about its role in a democratic Namibia that has shed its colonial occupation and gained independence. The monument was unmounted in 2009 at its original location opposite the Christuskirche in central Windhoek, and in 2010 re-erected a few metres away in front of the Alte Feste. After public controversy did not cease it was removed altogether in 2013. The bronze statue is currently in storage in the courtyard of the Alte Feste. Creation and erection Monument inscription in German. (Only the German losses are counted here) The Reiterdenkmal was financed privately and designed by Berlin sculptor Adolf K√ºrle. The equestrian statue is tall and made from bronze. It was created in Berlin and shipped to German South West Africa in 1911. After its arrival in Swakopmund it was transported by train to Windhoek. The plinth is tall and consists of approximately 180 granite rocks from Okahandja. It has a plaque mounted on it that remembers the German soldiers and civilians that died in the Herero and Namaqua War of 1904‚Äì1907, as well as in the Kalahari Expedition in 1908. The translation of the inscription is: > Remembering and honouring the brave German warriors that died for emperor > and empire to save and protect this land during the Herero and Hottentot > uprisings between 1903 and 1907, and during the Kalahari Expedition in 1908. > Also remembering and honouring German citizens that died from the hands of > the indigenous. Fallen, missing, died from accident, succumbed to their > injuries or sickness: Of the Protection Force: 100 officers, 254 non- > commissioned officers, 1180 soldiers, of the marine: 7 officers, 13 non- > commissioned officers, 27 seamen. Killed during the uprising: 119 men, 4 > women, 1 child. German South West African Governor Theodor Seitz inaugurated the monument on the 53rd birthday of German emperor Wilhelm II on 27 January 1912. Although the monument is unusual in that it displays a corporal on horseback, Namibian historian Andreas Vogt incorrectly claims that nowhere else in the world is an ordinary soldier sculpted in that manner and that the honour of being displayed on a horse is only extended to \\"highest nobility like emperors, kings and princes\\". German historian Joachim Zeller points out that traditionally equestrian statues symbolise imperial rule and power, and that this is how the function of the Reiterdenkmal has to be interpreted. Status The monument was erected not just to remember the dead. It was intended to serve as symbol of victory and a claim to rightful possession of South West African land. Elke Zuern, Professor of Politics at Sarah Lawrence College, writes: > \\"Memorials and commemorations offer stylized presentations of the past. > [...] They can also have profound political meaning by visibly presenting > victor‚Äôs justice and offering a warning to those who might continue to > resist. The Equestrian Monument in Windhoek served exactly this function. > Standing next to the German colonial fort and on the site of a wartime > concentration camp, it was erected by the German colonial masters as a > symbol of the longevity of their rule.\\" This political function of the Reiterdenkmal became obsolete within three years. World War I broke out, and in 1915 German South West Africa was overrun and the Schutztruppe surrendered. Germany lost all of its colonies after the war. Between the two World Wars the German war graveyard at Waterberg and the Reiterdenkmal were the two most important sites for war remembrance and mourning celebrations of the German minority in South West Africa. The monument also served as brand for German rule in Africa and was used for propaganda during the Third Reich. Books and movies featured pictures of it. In 1969, during the Apartheid era, it was declared a national monument by the South African administration. Controversies The Reiterdenkmal has long been controversial. Its continued display of German superiority, as well as its one-sided reporting on the deaths in the first decade of the 20th century‚ÄîHerero and Damara people lost fifty times as many lives as the Germans during the Herero and Namaqua War‚Äîattracted critical commentary, particularly since the 1980s. In 1959, a few days after the Old Location Uprising in which 11 people were killed, unknown Herero activists covered the rider's head with a linen bag and decorated the rest of the statue with flowers as a \\"protest against the atrocities of the white South African minority regime\\". After Namibia gained independence in 1990, white citizens of German descent feared that the statue would be destroyed, but this was not a priority of the SWAPO government, which preferred to build its own memorial sites to remember the independence struggle.Zuern, Elke (2012) Memorial Politics: challenging the dominant party's narrative in Namibia, JMAS 50,3: 496-9 Several other actions demonstrating the controversies around the monuments were performed in 2008. In July, 51 wooden crosses were erected around the statue, bearing names and expressions in Otjiherero, and in October, a Namibian flag was inserted into the rider's rifle barrel. Each action caused the discussion about status and justification of a monument glorifying German colonialism to flare up again in the local media. In 2001, the Cabinet of Namibia unanimously decided to build an Independence Museum at the site opposite the Christuskirche, at the place the Equestrian Monument stood. The removal of the statue was explicitly endorsed. When in 2009 construction of the museum began, the monument was wrapped, disassembled, and stored at a warehouse. The storage place was kept secret in order not to attract vandals and memorabilia collectors. Private donors financed the move as it was feared that it would otherwise be destroyed. In 2010, the monument was re-erected in front of the Alte Feste but discussions on its role in an independent Namibia did not cease. The National Heritage Council advertised the suggested de-proclamation as National Monument on 20 December 2013, giving the public 60 days to register objections. Only a few days into this period, on 25 December 2013, the area in front of Alte Feste was cordoned off to prevent public and press from getting close. Police Inspector-General Sebastian Ndeitunga confirmed that it was to be removed again, and the statue was lifted off its plinth in the evening of the same day and transported into the yard of Alte Feste for storage.

After starting her career in International Wrestling Association of Japan in August 1995, Sakura worked for several promotions across Japan, winning numerous titles, before founding her own promotion, Ice Ribbon, in early 2006. Sakura not only wrestled for the promotion, but was also solely responsible for training wrestlers for the promotion, where she went on to become a two-time ICE√ó60 Champion and a five- time International Ribbon Tag Team Champion. During 2009, Sakura held not only both the ICE√ó60 and International Ribbon Tag Team Championships, but also the Daily Sports Women's and JWP Tag Team Championships and the NEO Single and NWA Women's Pacific Championships, which led to the Tokyo Sports magazine naming her the 2009 joshi wrestler of the year. After six years with Ice Ribbon, Sakura left the promotion for \\"personal reasons\\" in January 2012. The following month, Sakura formed the Gatoh Move Pro Wrestling promotion in Bangkok, Thailand. During 2012, Sakura also became a regular for JWP Joshi Puroresu, winning the JWP Openweight Championship in October. Professional wrestling career =IWA Japan and FMW (1994‚Äì2002)= In 1994, at the age of seventeen, Motokawa decided to find a career in professional wrestling and after going to auditions with the Ladies Legend Pro-Wrestling (LLPW) and Gaea Japan promotions, she was finally accepted into the International Wrestling Association of Japan dojo for training. Motokawa, working under her real name, made her professional wrestling debut on August 17, 1995, in a match against Kiyoko Ichiki. As IWA Japan had no other female wrestlers, Sakura spent her first year working almost exclusively with Ichiki. On August 13, 1997, Motokawa won her first championship, when she defeated Luna Vachon at an IWA Japan event to win American Wrestling Federation's (AWF) World Women's Championship. When IWA Japan started a working relationship with All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling (AJW), Motokawa also began making appearances for AJW, unsuccessfully challenging Momoe Nakanishi for the AJW Junior Championship on August 26 and teaming with Manami Toyota in the 1997 Tag League the Best tournament. On January 24, 1998, Sakura defeated Momoe Nakanishi to win the AJW Championship. She would lose the title back to Nakanishi on April 12. On March 19, 1999, Motokawa lost the AWF World Women's Championship to Yuko Kosugi, after which she left IWA Japan. On August 20, 1999, Motokawa began working regularly for Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling (FMW), where she often wrestled opposite Kaori Nakayama. On October 24, 2000, Motokawa teamed with Azusa Kudo and Hisakatsu Oya to unsuccessfully challenge Nakayama, Gedo and Jado for the WEW 6-Man Tag Team Championship. Motokawa wrestled regularly for the promotion until August 2001, when she began suffering from various injuries, which eventually led her to undergo a hernia surgery. While she was sidelined, FMW went out of business. =Gatokunyan (2002‚Äì2006)= In 2002, Motokawa joined the Gatokunyan (GTKN) promotion, where she worked for the first year solely as a trainer, before returning to the ring in 2003 under the new ring name Emi Sakura. During her years in the GTKN, Sakura split her time between wrestling and training virtually all other wrestlers in the promotion. =Ice Ribbon (2006‚Äì2012)= In April 2006, Sakura left Gatokunyan to form her own promotion, named Ice Ribbon. Buying a dojo Saitama, Sakura continued to train wrestlers she had taken with her from Gatokunyan, including Aika Ando, Aoi Kizuki, Hikari Minami, Mai Ichii, Makoto, Riho and Seina. Ice Ribbon held its first two shows on June 20, 2006. Sakura wrestled her first match for the promotion on October 15, losing to Riho. Sakura spent most of her first year in Ice Ribbon, working with her then-nine-year-old pupil. From the start, Ice Ribbon had a close relationship with the NEO Japan Ladies Pro Wrestling promotion, which led to Sakura and some of her trainees making semi-regular appearances with the promotion. In storyline, the partnership was explained with a relationship between Sakura and NEO president Tetsuya Koda. On February 18, 2007, the Sakura Ribbon Army, a team of Sakura and some of her trainees and friends, defeated the NEO Machineguns Army in a seven-on-seven battle royal, earning Sakura and Koda the right to marry each other and unify NEO and Ice Ribbon. However, after pleading from her trainees, Sakura turned on Koda and abandoned him at the altar, ending the storyline. On July 16, Sakura teamed with Yoshiko Tamura to defeat Haruka Matsuo and Misae Genki for the NEO Tag Team Championship. They would lose the title to Ayako Hamada and Kaoru Ito just thirteen days later. During 2008, Sakura made her acting debut, working on the film Three Count, which was set in the world of professional wrestling and also starred fellow wrestler Kyoko Inoue and Yoshiko Tamura. From the cast of the film, Sakura received three more trainees to her Ice Ribbon dojo, Hikaru Shida, Miyako Matsumoto and Tsukasa Fujimoto. On November 15, 2008, Sakura teamed with male wrestler Ribbon Takanashi to unsuccessfully challenge Riho and Yuki Sato for the International Ribbon Tag Team Championship. The following April, Sakura teamed with another one of her trainees, Makoto, facing Nanae Takahashi and Minori Makiba in a losing effort in a match for the vacant International Ribbon Tag Team Championship. On May 3, 2009, Sakura defeated Nanae Takahashi at a NEO event to win the NEO Single and NWA Women's Pacific Championships. The finish of the match had to be improvised, after Sakura legitimately knocked Takahashi unconscious with a sunset flip powerbomb, which resulted in the referee ending the match without a three count and NEO president Tetsuya Koda awarding the titles to Sakura. Her reign ended just two days later, when she was defeated by Yoshiko Tamura. On July 5, Sakura and Nanae Takahashi defeated Tamura and Fuka in the finals to win NEO's Mid Summer Tag Tournament VIII. On July 19, Sakura teamed with Kaori Yoneyama at a JWP Joshi Puroresu event to defeat Command Bolshoi and Megumi Yabushita for the JWP Tag Team and Daily Sports Women's Tag Team Championships. Sakura won her first championship in Ice Ribbon on September 21, when she and Yoneyama defeated Takahashi and Makiba for the International Ribbon Tag Team Championship, becoming Triple Crown Tag Team Champions in the process. Sakura's streak of title wins continued on October 12, when she defeated Makoto for Ice Ribbon's top title, the ICE√ó60 Championship. During the next month, Sakura successfully defended the ICE√ó60 Championship eight times, defeating Hikari Minami, Mai Ichii, Chii Tomiya, Riho, Tsukasa Fujimoto, Makoto, Yukie Abe, and Misaki Ohata. On December 13, Sakura and Yoneyama lost all three of their tag team titles to Azumi Hyuga and Ran Yu-Yu at a JWP event. On December 17, in recognition of the six different championships Sakura held in 2009, the Tokyo Sports magazine named her the joshi wrestler of the year. On December 31, Sakura entered the Super-Ice Cup, where she put the ICE√ó60 Championship on the line in each of her matches. After defeating Miyako Matsumoto and Hikari Minami in her first round and semifinal matches, Sakura was defeated in the finals on January 4, 2010, by Tsukasa Fujimoto in just six seconds. With the defeat, Sakura's reign ended at 84 days and ten successful defenses. Also in January, Sakura debuted her newest trainee, the twelve-year- old Tsukushi, with whom she would work for most of the year. On April 3, Riho won the ICE√ó60 Championship for the first time and immediately afterwards nominated her trainer Sakura as her first challenger for the title, however, as the title had a weight limit, Sakura first had to drop of weight before being eligible to challenge for the title. On May 3 at Golden Ribbon, Sakura defeated Riho to win the ICE√ó60 Championship for the second time. After successful defenses against Tsukasa Fujimoto and Tsukushi, Sakura lost the title to Hikari Minami on July 19. On September 19, Sakura unsuccessfully challenged Kaori Yoneyama for the JWP Openweight Championship and was then, as per stipulation of the match, shaved bald. In late 2010, Ice Ribbon started an interpromotional storyline rivalry with the Sendai Girls' Pro Wrestling, which saw Sendai Girls' founder Meiko Satomura arrive to Ice Ribbon on September 23 to defeat Sakura in a singles match. Two days later, Sakura and Nanae Takahashi defeated Gentaro and Mai Ichii for the International Ribbon Tag Team Championship. On November 22, Sakura made her debut for Smash at Smash.10, where she teamed with Kaori Yoneyama in a losing effort against the team of Kana and Syuri. After a three-month reign, Sakura and Takahashi were stripped of the International Ribbon Tag Team Championship on December 11, after a title defense against Hikaru Shida and Yoshiko Tamura ended in a twenty-minute time limit draw. Sakura and Takahashi attempted to regain the title on December 23, but were defeated in the finals of a tournament by Muscle Venus (Hikaru Shida and Tsukasa Fujimoto). The following day, Sakura returned to Smash at Happening Eve, where she was defeated by Jessica Love. Sakura in February 2011 In February 2011, Sakura formed a tag team with the debuting Ray, her first ever trainee from the Gatokunyan dojo. On March 19, Sakura and Ray defeated Muscle Venus in a non-title match to earn a match for the International Ribbon Tag Team Championship on March 26, where they became the new champions. On April 10, Sakura attempted to become a double champion, but her match for the IW19 Championship with Tsukushi ended in a nineteen-minute time limit draw. On June 1, Sakura and Ray lost the International Ribbon Tag Team Championship to the Lovely Butchers (Hamuko Hoshi and Mochi Miyagi) in their fifth defense. Sakura regained the title from the Lovely Butchers on August 13, teaming with Makoto, who had just announced that she was leaving Ice Ribbon to join the Smash promotion on a full-time basis. After the two had successfully defended the title against Hikari Minami and Riho on August 17, Sakura defeated Makoto in her Ice Ribbon farewell match on August 21, after which the International Ribbon Tag Team Championship was vacated. In October, Sakura, Hikari Minami, Hikaru Shida and Tsukasa Fujimoto traveled to Nottingham, England to take part in events promoted by Pro-Wrestling: EVE and Southside Wrestling Entertainment (SWE). During the tour Sakura unsuccessfully challenged Jenny Sj√∂din for the Pro-Wrestling: EVE Championship. On October 27, Sakura led Team Ice Ribbon to Sendai Girls' Joshi Puroresu Dantai Taikou Flash tournament, a single-elimination tournament, where different joshi promotions battled each other. Ice Ribbon, represented by Sakura, Hikari Minami, Hikaru Shida, Tsukasa Fujimoto and Tsukushi, was eliminated from the tournament in the first round by their rival, Team Sendai, represented by Meiko Satomura, Dash Chisako, Kagetsu, Miyako Morino and Sendai Sachiko. On December 14, Sakura surprisingly announced that she was leaving Ice Ribbon for \\"personal reasons\\" following the January 7, 2012, event in Sendai. The storyline rivalry between Ice Ribbon and Sendai Girls' ended on December 25 at RibbonMania 2011, where Sakura and Tsukushi defeated Meiko Satomura and Sendai Sachiko to win the vacant International Ribbon Tag Team Championship. However, Sakura's and Tsukushi's reign would last only three days, before they lost the title to Hikaru Shida and Maki Narumiya. On January 7, 2012, Sakura was defeated by Tsukushi in her Ice Ribbon farewell match. =Gatoh Move Pro Wrestling (2012‚ÄìPresent)= Sakura made her first appearance as a freelancer on January 8, 2012, at Bull Nakano's retirement event, where she teamed with Meiko Satomura and Nanae Takahashi to defeat Ayumi Kurihara, Tsukasa Fujimoto and Yoshiko in a six-woman tag team match, pinning her trainee Fujimoto for the win. On February 12, Sakura appeared at a JWP event, where she announced that she was going to start another Ice Ribbon-like promotion in Bangkok, Thailand. Sakura and Kaori Yoneyama then agreed to a match, where, if Sakura was victorious, Yoneyama would join her in Thailand, but if Yoneyama was victorious, Sakura would make JWP her new home promotion in Japan. Sakura officially established the Bangkok Girls Pro Wrestling (BKK Pro) promotion the following week. On April 20, Sakura returned to Japan and made her debut for Pro Wrestling Wave, wrestling Toshie Uematsu in a losing effort as part of Uematsu's retirement tour. Following the match, Sakura teamed with Gami in a bonus match, where they wrestled Uematsu and Ran Yu-Yu to a five-minute time limit draw. Two days later, Sakura returned to JWP, defeating Kaori Yoneyama in a singles match; as a result, Yoneyama was forced to join BKK Pro. On May 4, Sakura and Yoneyama defeated Command Bolshoi and Rabbit Miu to win the vacant JWP Tag Team and Daily Sports Women's Tag Team Championships, taking the belts with them to Thailand. Later that same day, Sakura made an appearance for Union Pro Wrestling, replacing an injured Mio Shirai in a match and defeating Cherry, following interference from Shirai. Sakura's Thailand promotion, now renamed Gatoh Move Pro Wrestling, held its first official event on May 16. Sakura was assisted by Yoneyama and male wrestler Madoka in training wrestlers for the new promotion. Sakura and Yoneyama, now known collectively as the \\"Tai-Pan Sisters\\", returned to JWP on June 17 to make their first successful defense of the JWP Tag Team and Daily Sports Women's Tag Team Championships against the team of Arisa Nakajima and Manami Katsu. Sakura and Yoneyama made their second successful defense on July 15 against the team of Kazuki and Morii, after which they changed their team name from the Tai-Pan Sisters to \\"Reset\\". On August 19, Reset lost the titles to Arisa Nakajima and Command Bolshoi in their third title defense. On September 9, Sakura and Yoneyama defeated Hanako Nakamori and Morii in a tag team match, after which the two agreed to join Reset to form the \\"Heart Move Kei Reform\\" (HMK) stable. The first big match between HMK and the JWP Seikigun (\\"regular army\\") took place on October 7, when Sakura, Yoneyama, Nakamori and Morii defeated Arisa Nakajima, Command Bolshoi, Kayoko Haruyama and Manami Katsu 3‚Äì0 in an eight-woman captain's fall elimination tag team main event. Later that same day, Sakura's former Ice Ribbon prot√©g√© Riho, who had recently left Ice Ribbon to rejoin her trainer, made her debut for Gatoh Move, wrestling Sakura to a ten-minute time limit draw at an event in Shinjuku, Tokyo. On October 28, Sakura defeated Kayoko Haruyama to win the JWP Openweight Championship for the first time. Sakura made her first successful defense of the title at Pro- Wrestling: EVE's Wrestle-Fever internet pay-per-view event in Sudbury, Suffolk, England on November 10, 2012, defeating Kay Lee Ray. Later that evening, Sakura would answer an open challenge issued by the Pro-Wrestling: EVE Champion Nikki Storm, leading to Sakura defeating her to win the title. On December 20, Sakura made her first successful defense of the Pro-Wrestling: EVE Championship, wrestling Hiroyo Matsumoto to a twenty-minute time limit draw at a Gatoh Move event in Itabashi, Tokyo. Four days later, Sakura lost the JWP Openweight Championship to Arisa Nakajima in her second defense, ending her reign at just 57 days. The match ended the collaboration between Gatoh Move Pro Wrestling and JWP. While Hanako Nakamori and Morii chose to return to JWP, wrestling their final Gatoh Move matches on January 25, 2013, Kaori Yoneyama instead chose to quit the promotion she had been affiliated with for her entire career and become a freelancer following January 27 in order to be able to continue working for Gatoh Move. On February 2, Sakura returned to England, losing the Pro-Wrestling: EVE Championship back to Nikki Storm. Sakura returned to JWP on April 14, teaming with the debuting Nikki Storm to defeat former stablemates Hanako Nakamori and Morii in a tag team match. On May 11, Sakura defeated DJ Nira at a Gatoh Move event and, as a result, won his \\"Right to Challenge Anytime, Anywhere\\" contract, which gives its owner the right to challenge for the DDT Pro-Wrestling promotion's KO-D Openweight Championship. The following day, Sakura made her debut for World Wonder Ring Stardom, wrestling Nanae Takahashi to a fifteen-minute time limit draw. On May 17, before being able to cash it in, Sakura lost the \\"Right to Challenge Anytime, Anywhere\\" contract to Sayaka Obihiro. On May 25, Sakura made another trip to England to take part in Pro-Wrestling: EVE's 2013 Queen of the Ring tournament, where she made it to the finals, before losing to Shanna. Also in May, Sakura was involved in a storyline, where she supposedly found the old AWF World Women's Championship at the Hanazono Shrine flea market. She then contacted IWA Japan president Tatsukuni Asano, who bought back the title for ¬•2000. On June 1, Sakura returned to her original home promotion, IWA Japan, defeating Kappa Komachi to win the AWF World Women's Championship for the second time, sixteen years after she had won it the first time. She made her first successful defense of the title at a Gatoh Move event on July 15 against old associate Kiyoko Ichiki. Sakura's second successful title defense took place on August 10, when she defeated Welsh wrestler Pollyanna. On November 16, Sakura defeated Kyonin Shihan to combine the AWF World Women's Championship with the IWA World Heavyweight Championship and IWA World Junior Heavyweight Championships, creating the IWA Triple Crown. From December 22 to 23, Sakura and Riho worked two Wrestle-1 events, wrestling singles matches against each other; Riho won the first and Sakura the second. On December 27 at Gatoh Move's year-end event, Sakura lost the IWA Triple Crown to Antonio Honda. Sakura regained the Triple Crown from Honda on January 25, 2014. On February 23, Sakura made an appearance for DDT, taking part in a ten-person battle royal for the Ironman Heavymetalweight Championship.

On August 10, Sakura lost the IWA Triple Crown to Konaka=Pehlwan. She regained the title from Konaka on October 4. Despite IWA Japan folding on October 13, Sakura continued defending the IWA Triple Crown Championship, losing it to Riho in her second defense on November 2. On August 13, 2015, Sakura celebrated her 20th anniversary in professional wrestling at Gatoh Move's first ever event in Korakuen Hall, where she teamed with Makoto to defeat Hikaru Shida and Sayaka Obihiro in a tag team match. On April 23, 2016, Sakura made a surprise return to Ice Ribbon, marking her first appearance for the promotion in over four years. Sakura confronted Tsukasa Fujimoto, who had effectively taken over her role as the face of Ice Ribbon, and stated that it was time to end the promotion. She then revealed herself as Nanae Takahashi's tag team partner in a match against Fujimoto and Arisa Nakajima at Ice Ribbon's 10th anniversary show on May 4. In the match, Sakura was pinned by Fujimoto. On February 18, 2017, Sakura returned to Pro Wrestling: EVE, working two shows in one day, unsuccessfully challenging Rhia O'Reilly for the Pro Wrestling: EVE Championship on the second show.

In a career that lasted from April 1806 to April 1808, he ran fourteen times and won seven races. In 1806 he won the Derby on his third racecourse appearance shortly after being sold by his breeder. Paris stayed in training for two more years and had some success in match races. His racing career was ended by an injury at Newmarket Racecourse in 1808, after which he was retired to stud where he proved a to be a complete failure. Background Paris was a brown horse bred by his first owner Sir Frank Standish. Paris's sire, Sir Peter Teazle (or simply \\"Sir Peter\\") won the Epsom Derby in 1787 and became the most successful stallion of the time, winning the title of Champion sire on ten occasions between 1799 and 1809. Paris was the last foal of Horatia, a highly successful broodmare, who had previously produced the Derby winner Archduke and the double Doncaster Cup winner Stamford, both sired by Sir Peter. Racing career =1806: three-year-old season= Sir Frank Standish bred Paris but sold him just before his Classic win. Caricature by James Gillray. Until 1946 there was no requirement for British racehorses to be named, and in the early years of the nineteenth century it was common for horses to be known by their owner, colour, sex and pedigree rather than an official name. The colt who became Paris made his debut as \\"Sir F Standish's b c, brother to Stamford, by Sir Peter\\" at Newmarket on 7 April 1806. He started the 8/1 fourth choice in the betting for a six-runner Sweepstakes and won the prize by beating the favourite Podargus. Four days later at the same course \\"Sir F Standish's br c by Sir Peter out of Horatia\\" won another Sweepstakes, beating a single opponent at odds of 1/6. Before his next appearance in the Derby the colt was bought for 2,000 guineas by Lord Foley who named his acquisition Paris. At Epsom on 22 May he started the 5/1 second favourite in a field of twelve runners. Paris's former owner, Frank Standish, had the favourite for the race, an unnamed chestnut filly by Mr Teazle who started at 7/2. The race attracted a large and fashionable crowd including the Prince of Wales with his friends Lord Darlington and Sir John Lade. The early pace was fast, with Lord Egremont's colt Trafalgar running strongly but John Shepherd on Paris keeping his horse under restraint until the turn into the straight. In the last quarter mile Trafalgar and Paris pulled clear and raced \\"neck and neck\\" throughout the final furlong until Shepherd made a \\"desperate push\\" in the last strides to win by a head. Two days after the Derby, and racing over the same course and distance, Paris incurred his first defeat in a Produce Sweepstakes. After \\"a fine race\\" he finished second of the three runners to an unnamed colt (later named Canopus) to whom he was conceding five pounds. Paris returned after a four-month break for the autumn meetings at Newmarket. On 29 September he ran a 200 guinea match race against the previous year's Derby winner Cardinal Beaufort over the Abingdon Mile course. Paris was defeated by his older rival, from whom he was receiving eight pounds. Later the same afternoon he started 3/1 second favourite for a Sweepstakes \\"Across the Flat\\" (ten furlongs) and finished second to Mr Mellish's colt Smuggler. Two days later, Lord Foley was able to claim the prize money in a two-mile Subscription race when Paris was the only runner to appear and was allowed to walk over. Paris was scheduled to take part in a match race against Mr Payne's colt Tudor on 28 October, but failed to appear. =1807: four-year-old season= Paris's spring schedule in 1807 consisted of three match races at Newmarket. On 31 March he conceded three pounds to Mr Shakespear's filly Wretch over ten furlongs. Paris started the 4/6 favourite and defeated the filly to claim a prize of 200 guineas. Two weeks later over the same course and distance he beat Mr Shakespear's colt Achilles at level weights to win a further 200 guineas. On 30 April he was matched against Sir John Shelley's five-year-old Sir Launcelot, from whom he received seven pounds. He won 500 guineas by defeating the older horse over two miles at odds of 4/6. In late summer, Paris was sent on an unsuccessful journey to York. On 24 August he started 1/2 favourite for a Sweepstakes over four miles but finished last of the five runners behind Thorn. Two days later he ran in a three-mile Sweepstakes for four-year-olds against Thorn, Smuggler and the St Leger winner Fyldener, who was made 7/4 favourite. Paris started at odds of 6/1 and finished second to Smuggler. On his return to Newmarket, Paris started favourite for a Subscription race on 29 September and finished second to the Duke of Grafton's filly Vanity. =1808: five-year-old season= Paris stayed in training as a five-year-old, but his season was restricted to a single race. On 18 April at Newmarket, he broke down injured in a 500 guinea match against the Derby runner-up Trafalgar. He did not race again and was withdrawn from matches against Canopus in April and Smuggler in May. Stud career Paris was never advertised as a stallion in the Racing Calendar, and appears to have made no impact whatsoever as a sire. According to the General Stud Book he sired only two known foals, fillies born in 1810 (out of Venom) and 1812 (out of Roxana).

As a Royal Dignitary of Russia, he was one of the leading committee members which governed foreign affairs with an emphasis on Far Eastern issues at the beginning of the 20th century. The policies that he and his fellow committee members pursued played a significant role in causing the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904‚Äì1905. Biography =Ancestry= Abaza was descended from a Moldovan noble family. He was born on 30 April 1853, the son of Mikhail Ageevich Abaza (1825-1859) and Alexandra Alekseevna, nee Zolotareva. Two of his father's brothers were Erast Ageevich Abaza (1819‚Äì1855), a military officer and amateur musician noted for a Russian romance he wrote that set the words of Ivan Turgenev's poem Misty Morning () to music and was killed in the Crimean War, and Alexander Ageevich Abaza (1821‚Äì1895), a statesman who served as the Russian Empire's State Comptroller from 1871 to 1874 and its Minister of Finance from 1880 to 1881. After Prince Kudashev killed Abaza's father in a duel near the village of Melnikovka in the Cherkassk District in Kiev Governorate in 1859, Abaza's mother married Count Lev Alekseyevich Bobrinsky (1831‚Äì1915) in 1866. =Naval career= After education at the Naval Cadet Corps, Abaza entered the Imperial Russian Navy on 1 May 1873 as a Junker in the Baltic Fleet, in which he made a training cruise in the Gulf of Finland aboard the armored frigate . From 1873 to 1874, he made a cruise in the Mediterranean Sea aboard the armored frigate . Between 1874 and 1879 he made an around the world cruise on the steam corvette '. During the cruise, he was promoted to midshipman on 5 December 1875 and to michman on 11 September 1876. After completing the voyage aboard Bayan, Abaza became flag lieutenant to the commander of the Pacific Ocean Squadron in the Russian Far East, Admiral Avraamy Aslanbegov. While visiting Japan, the Japanese government awarded him the Order of the Rising Sun. He made cruises aboard the cruiser , the armored cruiser , the clipper , and again aboard Kniaz Pozharsky. He was promoted to lieutenant on 1 January 1881, and in 1882 he was awarded the Order of Saint Stanislaus Third Class and served on the cruiser . In 1883, Abaza made a cruise aboard the clipper , visiting the Tatar Strait and foreign ports. In 1885 he served aboard the armored cruiser and the yacht . Abaza traveled to Elbing in the German Empire in 1886 to organize the transfer of three torpedo boats there to the Black Sea Fleet. He then was assigned to accompany the managing director of the Ministry of the Navy, Vice Admiral Ivan Shestakov, on a trip to the ports of eastern Siberia. He returned from the Russian Far East on the Dobroflot steamer , having completed a round-the-world voyage. He the commanded the steamers and . In 1887, Abaza cruised in the Baltic Sea on the yacht Strelna, the torpedo boat No. 139, the cruiser Asia, and the armored cruiser . In 1888 he again served on Strelna. In 1889, Abaza served as adjutant in the retinue of General Admiral Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich, visiting the Black Sea Fleet and putting to sea on the steamship and the battleship . He was promoted to captain second rank in 1890. Between 1892 and 1894 he served consecutively as commanding officer of the steam corvette and the cruiser Asia. Abaza was promoted to captain first rank on 2 April 1895. He traveled to France to oversee the construction there of the protected cruiser , then commanded her until 1899, when he was appointed commander of the Guards Naval Crew, a Life Guards formation of the Russian Imperial Guard. He was promoted to rear admiral on 1 April 1901. Political career On 6 May 1902, Abaza was appointed to the retinue of Tsar Nicholas II.–°–≤–∏—Ç—ã –ï–≥–æ –ò–º–ø–µ—Ä–∞—Ç–æ—Ä—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –í–µ–ª–∏—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –≥–µ–Ω.-–º–∞–π–æ—Ä—ã –∏ –∫–æ–Ω—Ç—Ä-–∞–¥–º–∏—Ä–∞–ª—ã // On 10 November 1902 he became the Assistant Chief of the Ministry of Merchant Shipping and Ports and served as commander of the training detachment of the Naval Cadet Corps. He became acting deputy head of the ministry on 20 January 1903. On 10 October 1903, Abaza was appointed manager of the Special Committee for the Affairs of the Far East. In this position, he enjoyed the right of a personal report to Nicholas II. Along with his cousin, Aleksandr Mikhailovich Bezobrazov, who was a state secretary, he had a great influence on diplomatic work with Japan, actually pushing aside the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The so-called \\"Bezobrazov clique\\" ‚Äî made up of Abaza, Bezobrazov, and Admiral Yevgeni Ivanovich Alekseyev ‚Äî was convinced of Japan's weakness and negotiated with Japan as if Russia was in a position of strength; according to then-Finance Minister Sergei Witte, a note Abaza presented to Nicholas II in March 1903 actually decided the question of starting a war with Japan. The \\"Bezobrazov clique\\" in this way played a predominant role in triggering the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War in February 1904. With the war underway, Abaza traveled incognito to Western Europe in the autumn of 1904 to organize the purchase through third parties of seven South American cruisers ‚Äî the armored cruisers , , , from Argentina and the armored cruisers and and protected cruiser from Chile ‚Äî so that Russia could use them in military operations against Japan. The mission ended in failure. On 13 June 1905, Abaza was dismissed from the post of manager of the Special Committee for the Far East and the committee was abolished. Although this left him in the tsar's retinue and in the Guards Naval Crew, his political influence on state affairs came to an end. Subsequently, after the Russo-Japanese War culminated in Russia‚Ä≤s defeat, Abaza drew up another note justifying the behavior of the 'Bezobrazov clique\\" leading up to the war. The Russian government official and politician Vladimir Gurko, a contemporary of Abaza, described him as follows: > Being a seaman by service, he accidentally fell in with the heads of Russian > foreign policy, and boldly took upon himself the resolution of extremely > complex and delicate international issues, without the slightest preparation > for that, relying only on the possibility of direct relations with [Tsar > Nicholas II at] Tsarskoye Selo ... Abaza died either in 1915 or on 3 February 1917. Personal life Abaza married Natalia Feodorovna, nee Vasilchikova, who died in France sometime after 1930. They had six children: Alexander, born 12 March 1887, who reached the rank of captain second rank in the Imperial Russian Navy and died in Bordeaux, France, in September 1943; Vladimir; Leo, born 18 June 1897; Elizaveta, who was born in 1892 and died in 1941 in Saratov in the Soviet Union; Elena, born 4 June 1894; and Andrey, who was born in 1903 and died in 1941 in a Sevvostlag forced labor camp in the Soviet Union.

It existed in the short phase after the democratic uprising in 1973 until 1976. Although not having a strong ideological orientation, it was mostly considered conservative and right-wing. The party had strong backing from circles inside the military, and represented the interests of General Krit Srivara and Air Marshal Dawee Chullasap. It was led by Thawit Klinprathum, who was close to former military dictators Thanom Kittikachorn and Praphas Charusathien. The party was one of the main parties in the parliamentary elections of 1975 and 1976. In 1975 it won 45 of the 269 seats, making it the second-strongest party. Most of the elected representatives came from the Northeastern and Central regions. In March 1975, two months after the elections, the party joined the \\"United Parties coalition\\" with the Social Action Party, the Thai Nation Party, and four minor parties under the premiership of Kukrit Pramoj. Party leader Thawit Klinprathum became agriculture minister. The coalition broke in January 1976, partly due to the social unrest in the country, and partly due to quarrels inside the coalition, mainly between Social Justice and Thai Nation parties. Before the following snap election, Dawee Chullasap replaced Thawit Klinprathum as party chairman. In the election, the Social Justice Party lost 17 of its seats and became only the fourth force in parliament. However, it could again join a coalition government, this time led by the Democrat Party of Seni Pramoj. The government was toppled by a military coup d'√©tat on 6 October 1976, after the Thammasat University massacre. Afterwards, the Social Justice Party disappeared from the Thai political landscape.

Caudell was born August 18, 1872, in Indianapolis, Indiana, a son of Andrew Jackson and Mary Jane (n√©e Bannon) Caudell. Raised in Oklahoma, he collected insects around the family farm. His introduction to entomology happened when he sheltered in an old building during a rain. There he found a copy of the US Department of Agriculture with notes on insects. He became an assistant at the entomology collections at the local college even before graduating at the agricultural college and then joined to complete his Bachelor of Science degree at Oklahoma Territorial Agricultural and Mechanical College in Stillwater, Oklahoma, now Oklahoma State University, and undertook postgraduate study at Massachusetts Agricultural College, now the University of Massachusetts Amherst. After a brief employment with the Gypsy Moth Project in Massachusetts, he joined the Division of Insects of the United States Department of Agriculture in 1898 and remained with the department until his death. In addition to his USDA duties, he served as custodian of the Orthoptera collection of the Division of Insects of the United States National Museum, now the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C. Along with Harrison Dyar, he was sent on collection expeditions to British Columbia (1903) and Colorado (1901). Caudell maintained meticulous card indexes on Orthoptera and also took an interest in the Zoraptera and was well known for writing the Entomological Code in 1912 with Nathan Banks that was considered a supplement to the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. He married on April 12, 1900, Penelope Lee Cundiff in a unique ceremony performed over telegraph lines with the bride in Mulhall, Oklahoma, and the groom in Kansas City, Kansas, with the minister and two witnesses, possibly the first such ceremony ever performed. They had one daughter. Caudell died on March 1, 1936, at Washington, D.C. Among other honors, he is memorialized by two pyralid moth taxa published in a single paper by fellow entomologist and co-worker Harrison Gray Dyar Jr., the species Megasis caudellella (Dyar, 1904) and the genus Caudellia (Dyar, 1904)Harrison G.

B-4) and the ability to seize funds that have been deposited by a debtor into an account held at a financial institution in Canada. The facts McLeod, a practising member of the Law Society of British Columbia, maintained a trust account with Canada Trustco for the purposes of his law practice. In addition, he and another lawyer held a joint account at the same branch. Each of the accounts was governed by an agreement. McLeod owed tax to the federal government. The Minister became aware that cheques payable to McLeod were being drawn on the trust account and deposited in the joint account. Each of the cheques during the period in question was drawn on the trust account, was payable to McLeod and was delivered to Trustco with an instruction to deposit the funds in the joint account. This instruction was given by writing \\"Dep to\\" and the account number on the back of the cheque. As the Minister did not have the ability to seize funds from either the trust account or the joint account (because the tax debt was solely in McLeod's name), he therefore focused on the cheques that had been issued, and issued three requirements to pay to Trustco. According to these requirements, Trustco was to pay to the Receiver General moneys otherwise payable to McLeod. In response to the requirements to pay, Trustco disputed its liability on the ground that it was \\"not indebted to the [taxpayer] alone\\". The Minister assessed Trustco for the amounts of the cheques for failing to comply with the three requirements to pay. Trustco filed notices of objection. After they were rejected, it appealed to the Tax Court of Canada. The courts below The Tax Court of Canada dismissed the Bank's appeal. Little J. held that the proceeds of the cheques were \\"payable\\" to McLeod because the debtor-creditor relationship between Trustco and Mr. McLeod required the former to repay the funds deposited in the trust account to the account holder on demand. In his view, Trustco's liability arose when Mr. McLeod \\"presented the bank with the cheques\\". This led Little J. to conclude that he did not need to examine the fact that the moneys had actually been transferred from the trust account to the joint account. Therefore, the Minister's requirement to pay had effect. The Federal Court of Appeal found that no \\"palpable or overriding error\\" had been made and unanimously upheld Little J.'s decision. Appeal to the Supreme Court On a 4-3 majority, the appeal was allowed and the assessments vacated. At the hearing, Trustco argued that the trial judge failed to differentiate between a demand for repayment of funds deposited in an account and the delivery of a cheque for deposit. In its view, it was liable only ‚Äî as drawee ‚Äî to pay funds out of the trust account upon proper presentment for payment by the holder of the cheque. At no point was it liable to make a payment to McLeod, the tax debtor. For its part, Canada contended that there was no distinction between presentment of a cheque to the drawee for the payment of cash to McLeod and presentment of a cheque for deposit to the joint account. Its position is that when McLeod delivered the cheques to Trustco and instructed it to pay the amounts into the joint account, he acted as payee, creditor, drawer, and depositor, but that his role as depositor was irrelevant. =The majority judgment= The Bank was at no point liable to pay M the proceeds of the cheques. The fact that a person is designated as payee on the face of a cheque does not on its own mean that a bank is liable to make a payment to the person. A drawee is answerable to the drawer. The question is to whom the drawee may make the payment. What is on the back of the cheque ‚Äî the instructions or the endorsement ‚Äî is crucial to this question. In this case, the instructions were to deposit the cheques into the joint account. The Bank's liability to pay monies to M personally cannot be confused with its liability to pay monies to the holders of the joint account. There were no instructions that made the monies payable to M. There was nothing in the contractual relationships, the Bills of Exchange Act or the common law that would indicate otherwise. In crediting the joint account, sending the cheques to a third party for clearing, and receiving the proceeds, the Bank was acting on the basis of its contractual relationship with the holders of the joint account and not on behalf of M personally. When the Bank debited the trust account the next day, it was not making a payment to M or to an agent acting for him alone. The Bank owed no money to M, as it was acting as the collecting bank for its customers, the holders of the joint account. It did not collect the proceeds of the cheques as agent for the payee, M. =The dissent= The minority disagreed with respect to two narrow points, declaring (based on the Court's opinion in B.M.P. Global Distribution Inc. v. Bank of Nova Scotia):B.M.P. Global Distribution Inc. v. Bank of Nova Scotia, * the bank does not become the holder of a cheque, but rather collects the funds as agent for its principal, and * a bank receives the funds as the payee's agent, and while they are in transit the funds are only payable to the payee. Subsection 165(3) of the BEA does not establish that the bank becomes a holder of the cheque ‚Äï its limited objective is achieved by granting the collecting bank all the rights and powers of a holder in due course, and does not require the bank to be actually designated a holder in due course. Once the Bank received M's cheques to himself, its liability to its customer was triggered. The Bank was therefore contractually bound to honour its customer's demand to pay him. As such, all of the requirements of s. 224(1) of the ITA were met, and the requirement to pay attached to the money in transit between M's accounts. Aftermath The ruling conflicts with established principles governing banking and bills of exchange law in Canada. The minority also noted that the majority's view of a joint account \\"may negatively impact other areas of the law\\", which may require amendment of the relevant statutes.

The surveys from 1893 proposed a line which would run from K√•berg through M√¶re to Vist. Two alternative proposals were made, both which ran further east and higher up. The first was for it to run via Leira to Hamren and then down to M√¶re; this would cost 30,000 Norwegian krone extra and increased the railway's gradient. The second alternative would run from R√∏skje via Ystg√•rd, Lein, J√∏rum, Lian and L√•nkan to Vist. The second alternative went through even more rolling terrain and would be longer. Both were quickly rejected by the railway engineers.Ho√•s and Stene (2006): 58 The reason for the alternatives was that there was local desire for the station to be located Lein, which at the time was the natural community center, as it had Nord-Tr√∏ndelag county's largest dairy and the store.Ho√•s and Stene (2006): 59 Also the placement of stations was contentious. The original plans called for two stations, at Leira (later Sparbu) and Vist. At the time, neither of these locations represented any center of community life. An alternative location at M√¶re was proposed, with its proponents arguing that it was closer to the newly established M√¶re Upper Secondary School and M√¶re Church. The issue was debated in the municipal council in 1898. The initial council decision was to place the station at K√•berg or Hamrun, both at Sparbu, in addition to Vist. Proponents of this location argued that Sparbu was closer for a larger share of the municipality's residents, as a large part of the farms were located uphill from Sparbu. Voting was largely after which station was closest to home for each councilor. The municipal council officially recommended Parliament to choose K√•berg on 17 January 1900. In the Parliamentary proposal, Sparbu and Vist were suggested as stations. However, in the session, a proposal for a single station at M√¶re was made and was passed by Parliament on 5 June 1900. During the fall, the Nord-Tr√∏ndelag parliamentarians asked that the issue of stations be considered again and that the legislature consider additional stations at R√∏skje and Vist. On 24 April 1901, Parliament decided that there be built two stations, one at Sparbu and one at Vist. On 25 February 1904, the county engineer proposed moving the station from Sparbu to M√¶re, but this discarded after the construction difficulties were solved.Ho√•s and Stene (2006): 60 The Hell‚ÄìSunnan Line was completed on 14 November 1905 without a station at M√¶re.Ho√•s and Stene (2006): 77 M√¶re continued to be the dominant center of Sparbu, as it the following ten years saw both a penal institution and trial farm be established. In 1915, central authorities again started working on plans for a station at M√¶re. However, the government required that Sparbu Municipality grant towards the station, something the municipality was not willing to do. Financing was therefore secured through private donations. Construction started in 1916 and the station opened on 1 April 1917.Bjerke and Holom (1994): 95 At the time M√¶re Station opened, neither Sparbu nor M√¶re were settlements. Coop established a store at M√¶re in 1922, which was followed by a power station, a bank and a cheese factory. Sparbu, located south, also received many public facilities. In 1940, the administrative seat of Sparbu was moved to M√¶re, after which M√¶re Station had higher patronage than Sparbu Station. However, the choice to build two stations close to each other resulted in two small villages, neither of which was able to provide a full range of services, and both stations retained low patronage.Ho√•s and Stene (2006): 61 M√¶re Station remained manned until 16 February 1969 and on 24 October 1977, the line past the station received centralized traffic control. M√¶re became part of the Tr√∏ndelag Commuter Rail from 1 September 1993, giving the station ten daily services in each direction between Steinkjer and Trondheim. The station was upgraded with a new shed. In March 2000, NSB announced a heavy decrease of stations along the commuter rail, and instead uses buses to freight people to more central stations. From 7 January 2001, M√¶re became one of six stations between Steinkjer and Trondheim to be closed. Facilities M√¶re Station was located on the Nordland Line at from Trondheim Central Station, at above mean sea level. The station had only a simple single story station building and lacked a passing loop.

Balsley's firm has been active for over 35 years. Life and career Thomas Balsley was born in 1943 and studied at Syracuse University and then the SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry. He moved to New York City in 1970, and within a year founded his own firm, Thomas Balsley Associates. In New York City alone, Mr. Balsley has completed more than 100 parks and plazas, most notably Riverside Park South and Gantry Plaza State Park. In addition, to his above ground work, NYC MTA selected his bench design for its transit systems. In a gesture of recognition for his contribution to New York City's public spaces, Balsley Park, formerly known as Sheffield Plaza, on 9th Avenue between 56th and 57th Streets in New York City, has been renamed in honor of the landscape designer. About Gantry Plaza State Park, former New York Times architecture critic Herbert Muschamp wrote, ‚ÄúThe evil spell is broken... The curse that reduced New York‚Äôs landscape architects to creating Disney versions of Central Park has been at least temporarily lifted.‚Äù Balsley's work can be seen in the United States in the downtown and waterfront parks of major cities like Dallas, Los Angeles, Portland, Detroit, Cleveland, Tampa, and Baltimore's Inner Harbor. Recently-won international design competitions include the Magok Waterfront and the National Ecological Center in Korea and Kasumigaseki Plaza in Tokyo. He has given lectures at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, the University of Pennsylvania, the National Building Museum and Seoul National University. In addition he has received international recognition in the form of awards and citations from professional and civic organizations, including the American Society of Landscape Architects, the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, the American Institute of Architects, Environmental Design Research Association, the Institute for Urban Design and the Waterfront Center.

He was found with both legs cut off to stumps, and when questioned by locals he said very little, suggesting he did not speak English. When asked for his name he mumbled something that resembled \\"Jerome\\", and so that was what he became known as.  Discovery  He was found by an 8-year- old boy named George Colin \\"Collie\\" Albright, and brought to the Albright home in the village of Digby Neck to be nursed back to health. Both of Jerome's legs had been amputated just above the knees, with evidence that it had been done by a skilled surgeon. The stumps were only partially healed and still bandaged when he was found. He was also suffering from cold and exposure. Many people eager to know more about him visited his sick bed, and through this it was discovered that he could not (or did not want to) understand French, Latin, Italian, or Spanish. He apparently shunned the attention of these curious onlookers, growling like a dog at unwanted guests. The man's hands were noted as being too soft for him to be a manual labourer, and he was described as being Mediterranean in appearance. The Albrights struggled to support another mouth to feed, and Jerome was passed from house to house for a while until the mainly Baptist community of Digby Neck decided from his appearance that he must be a Catholic, and sent him to the neighbouring French community of Meteghan. The government of Nova Scotia also voted a special stipend of two dollars a week to support Jerome. The community still trying to break his relative silence, Jerome was sent to stay with Jean Nicola, a Corsican deserter and speaker of several languages. Nicola could not get him to talk, but Jerome stayed in the Nicola home for seven more years, becoming a favourite of the ladies of the household - Jean's wife Julitte and his stepdaughter Madeleine. After the death of Julitte Nicola, her husband returned to Europe and Jerome went to stay with Dedier and Zabeth Comeau in St. Alphonse, near Meteghan. The Comeaus used Jerome's relative fame to their advantage, charging admission fees to see the mystery man, living well on this and the government stipend. But Jerome did not seem to mind, and stayed there for the rest of his life, which ended on April 15, 1912.  Legacy and possible explanations  It has been suggested that Jerome was a sailor who may have attempted a mutiny, being punished by amputation. Another suggestion is that he could have been an heir to a fortune and was \\"gotten rid of\\" to make way for someone else seeking his inheritance. It is possible that Jerome's difficulties with producing speech could be linked to a brain injury, most likely in Broca's Area, the part of the brain that regulates speech. Jerome would have been incapable of speaking in any sort of understandable language. This may account for Jerome's ability to make animalistic noises, but not replicate human language. Jerome has figured strongly in the popular imagination in Nova Scotia, and there have been several books written about the case. In 1994 there was a feature film produced about Jerome. It was directed by Phil Comeau, and entitled Jerome's Secret. In 2008, local historian Fraser Mooney Jr. of Yarmouth, Nova Scotia published a book entitled Jerome: Solving the Mystery of Nova Scotia's Silent Castaway. In this book, Mooney offers a solution to the man's mysterious origins. He reports that on the other side of the Bay of Fundy, in Chipman, New Brunswick in 1859 (a few years before Jerome's appearance) a young foreigner was reported as having fallen through river ice. He suffered gangrene in both legs due to the accident and they had to be amputated by a local doctor. Here he became known as \\"Gamby\\", probably because on wakening he kept calling for gamba, Italian for \\"leg\\". Gamby proved to be a burden for the people of Chipman, and it was rumoured that a passing schooner captain was paid to transport him away. The captain could possibly have just sailed to the opposite side of the bay to Nova Scotia, where he became Sandy Cove's problem. Mooney's account has been controversial. Notably, the writer Noah Richler has called the book speculative and a fiction.

Kennedy and numerous state and federal agencies, and a Board Chairman of the San Francisco Trauma Foundation. Education and early career Born August 31, 1924, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Dr. O'Rourke was a 1948 graduate of Harvard University Medical School and an early proponent of equal access to health care for underprivileged and disenfranchised populations. In 1959, while in his early 30s, he left a private practice in Marin County, California, to serve the state‚Äôs migrant laborers, minorities, and the poor. Dr. O‚ÄôRourke earned a Master‚Äôs of Public Health Degree in Epidemiology at UC Berkeley, and in 1960 took his first public sector job as Director of Public Health Services in Imperial County, an agricultural region with the state‚Äôs highest rates of infant mortality and tuberculosis. Imperial County The Imperial Valley was at the time the focus of AFL-CIO efforts to unionize farm laborers, whose wages averaged 90 cents an hour. Under pressure from local growers and out of concern for the agricultural economy, the county Board of Supervisors directed Dr. O'Rourke to withhold health services from strikers and union sympathizers among the farm worker ranks, but he did not comply. When more than 40 strikers were arrested and incarcerated in the county‚Äôs jail, Dr. O‚ÄôRourke was asked by the state to confirm that conditions at the jail were safe and sanitary. Dr. O‚ÄôRourke concluded that the jail was not adequate to house that many people. His report to that effect was considered by the Board of Supervisors to be insubordinate, and they discharged him from his post. The California Department of Health Services then threatened to withhold state funding from Imperial County unless Dr. O‚ÄôRourke was reinstated, and although he did continue in his position for several more months, he ultimately resigned, stating that the political environment prevented him from carrying out the mission of the department. Dr. O‚ÄôRourke submitted his resignation one year from the date he accepted the position. Public service Shortly thereafter in 1962, he was appointed as Chief of Farm Worker Health Services for the California State Department of Health. He was considered the California state specialist in poverty matters and in 1964 became Special Assistant for Anti-Poverty Programs to Governor Edmund G. \\"Pat\\" Brown, who appointed him the first Director of the State Office of Economic Opportunity, an outgrowth of President Lyndon B. Johnson‚Äôs War on Poverty. In that role Dr. O‚ÄôRourke helped coordinate the efforts of state agencies to establish equal access to housing, employment, education, and health services. He continued to advise federal agencies on matters of migrant health, public hospitals, and community clinics in rural settings and was an advisor to the U.S. Senate Health Committee during development of the Medicaid program. Dr. O‚ÄôRourke also served as a public health consultant to the NAACP and the Legal Defense Fund, and advised the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on the enforcement of Title Vl, the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In 1967, Dr. O'Rourke began work with Senator Robert F. Kennedy on community health programs in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhoods in Brooklyn, N.Y. and was the founding Director of the East Palo Alto Neighborhood Health Center from 1967 to 1970. He served as a health policy analyst and advisor to the California State Senate on issues and legislation including industrial relations, occupational disability, mental health, injury prevention, and Worker‚Äôs Compensation reform. In 1990 Dr. O‚ÄôRourke became a consultant to California's Little Hoover Commission, providing oversight of Medi-Cal and other state health programs.

Ltd. was a Japanese consumer electronics company headquartered in Yokohama, Japan, first founded in 1955 and ended in 2004, after filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Shintom was engaged in the development, manufacture, and sale of mobile phone, car audio, transistor radio, videocassette recorder, measuring instrument, and medical equipment.Shintom Co. Ltd. Shintom had two factories worldwide, located both in Japan and Indonesia. Shintom first held a stake with Audiovox in 1980 as an OEM supplier for Audiovox car stereos. Shintom was mostly well-known for designing, selling, and supplying the VHS transport chassis mechanism to various Japanese VHS VCR manufacturers during the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s. Funai Electric (its biggest customer), Sony Corporation, Aiwa Corporation, Toshiba Corporation, Memorex Corporation, and Private Label Store Brands joined in. Operations began in 1984 when Funai ordered the chassis mechanisms from Shintom, while assembling VHS players and recorders for several OEM customer brands. This business accounted about 70% of Shintom's total revenue, since Funai was their largest customer. Shintom's original chassis mechanism was built to industrial-grade, high-reliability standards, since demand for rental video cassette players skyrocketed during the mid-1980s, although most units ended up sold for consumer use. Shintom was also credited for developing the world's first geared-driven VCR dual-idler wheel system, which eliminated the need of a rubber tire found in earlier VHS machines.  History  By 1986, Shintom began to market its own brand of VHS players/recorders lineup and other electronic devices to compete with other makes, along with industry's first 2-week, 6-event timer recording. A new North American headquarter opened in United States as Shintom West Corp. of America located in Torrance, CA. Shintom's original advertisement consisted of industrial-design, ruggedness, and simplicity without the high cost. In 1992, without any warning, Funai canceled the contract after decided to build its own chassis-mechanism, as well as moving all VCR assemblies to China by 1993, which still continues today. This sudden cancellation request by Funai permanently damaged Shintom's total revenue and investment capital, and it didn't allow sufficient time for Shintom to invest in new products. To prevent a freefall and risk going bankrupt, Shintom tried contacting Funai for several years if they could joint-merger but was denied each time, stating Funai is a family-owned, private corporation. By 1995, Sony stopped ordering Shintom's mechanism that was used for non-editing VHS VCRs, VCPs, and TV/VCR combos. Therefore, the VHS chassis mechanism business was dissolved. During the 1990s, Shintom became the OEM manufacturer for assembled VHS VCRs, mobile phones, and car audio, while also producing measuring instrument and medical equipment for hospitals. VHS VCRs still accounted at least 50% of production business. Some brands included were Aiwa, Audiovox, Go Video, Sansui, Sony, and Toshiba. When Funai left, Toshiba became the next major customer for assembled VCRs beginning in 1993. In 1996, Shintom won the contact from Go Video for assembling dual-deck VCRs. By 2001, VHS player/recorder production was eliminated when demand for DVD players rose sharply. Shintom chose not to enter the DVD player or television manufacturing market, predicting it would be too late, but instead, Shintom turned to the cellular phone market for Audiovox. Due to slow sales of Audiovox cellular phones and lack of resources and funds in developing new products, with existing products quickly becoming obsolete, by 2002, Shintom was seriously in big trouble. Shintom's stock was removed from the Tokyo Stock Exchange for the first time, after three years of negative net worth value. In September 2004, Shintom sued Audiovox for $2.5 million in damages for dividends that didn't pay during the Audiovox merger. Shintom never approved the merger that created the preferred shares in the first place. The Court ruled that the preferred stock may not confer dividend rights, and Audiovox won the case. Shortly after that, in 2004, Shintom filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, after six years of huge public debt, and the company is now dissolved with all factories and offices worldwide closed and later sold. Unipres Corporation took over Shintom's head office in May 2004 at Yokohama, Japan, and it's currently the main office today.

Ship history The Li Wo was a passenger riverboat built by the Hong Kong & Whampoa Dock Company for the Indo-China Steam Navigation Company Ltd. for service on the Yangtze River. In 1940 she was requisitioned and commissioned into the Royal Navy at Singapore. Shortly before the British surrender, Li Wo was ordered to head for the safety of Batavia in the Dutch East Indies. Her crew consisted of 84 men, mostly naval reservists, but also included several survivors from the Prince of Wales and Repulse, five men from the Army, two from the RAF, ten Malayans, and six Chinese. She left Singapore at dawn on 13 February 1942, and was attacked several times from the air, suffering some damage. The next day while passing north of the Bangka Strait, she encountered a convoy of Japanese transport ships accompanied by a squadron of warships launching \\"Operation L\\", the invasion of Sumatra. The commander of Li Wo, Temporary Lieutenant Thomas Wilkinson RNR, informed the ship's company that he intended to close and attack the enemy. Li Wo altered course towards the leading transport ship of the convoy at full speed, unfurling her battle ensign, and opening fire with her four-inch gun (for which she had only 13 shells, plus three practice rounds). She scored a number of direct hits on the transport, starting fires aboard, and causing the troops aboard to abandon ship. She then attacked another transport ship with machine gun fire. Li Wo was then heavily shelled by the light cruiser and the destroyers and . Out of ammunition and now sinking, she rammed the first enemy transport, which later sank, before finally sinking herself. Of the 84 crew, only 7 survived to be taken prisoner. Awards Lieutenant Wilkinson, the captain, posthumously received the Victoria Cross, while his first officer Temporary Sub-Lieutenant Ronald George Gladstone Stanton RNR was awarded the Distinguished Service Order. The Conspicuous Gallantry Medal was awarded to Acting Petty Officer Arthur William Thompson, and the Distinguished Service Medal to Leading Seaman Victor Spencer and Able Seaman Albert Spendlove.

On his approach descent he encountered fog and overshot the runway. The plane flipped over, but the ELT (Emergency Locator Transmitter) device in the airplane did not trigger. Scruggs remained unattended with a broken ankle, nose, and other injuries for about five hours. Fearing a possible fire, Scruggs was able to crawl about 150 feet from the plane despite his injuries. His family was driving back from the concert in Kentucky and was unaware of the accident, but a niece became worried, called police about 4 AM and went to the airpark where they heard his cry for help near the wreckage. Scruggs recovered from his injuries. Thirty small planes were damaged at Cornelia Fort Airport during the 1998 tornado outbreak. Russell W. Brothers, Jr., a Nashville businessman, was familiar with Cornelia Fort Airpark and at one time lived there. At age 75, Brothers was flying a private plane solo at night from Miami, Florida to Dickson, Tennessee on April 20, 2012. After trouble with the landing grear, he made a crash- landing in his 1961 vintage twin-engine Beechcraft airplane at the Cornelia Fort Airpark which was closed at the time. Without functioning landing gear, he made a belly landing on a grassy area. The landing was not violent enough to trigger an alert signal by the airplane's emergency locator transmitter which would have notified authorities. Brothers was not injured and left the scene without notifying authorities. His wife picked him up, and he left the plane there as a mystery. A maintenance worker later saw it, but did not alert authorities until the following morning. The police traced the plane to Brothers and searched his home, where they found 16 firearms. Since he had a prior conviction as a felon 24 years previously, it was unlawful for Brothers to possess firearms. Subsequently, he was convicted of unlawful possession of firearms and obstruction of justice. Brothers pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court to the weapons charge and also to obstruction of a federal investigation, receiving a 15-month jail sentence.  Facilities and aircraft  The airport's former facilities Cornelia Fort Airpark covered an area of 300 acres (121 ha) at an elevation of 418 feet (127 m) above mean sea level. It had one runway designated 4/22 with an asphalt surface measuring 3,500 by 50 feet (1,067 x 15 m). For the 12-month period ending March 6, 2009, the airport had 30,110 aircraft operations, an average of 82 per day: 95% general aviation and 5% air taxi. At that time there were 27 aircraft based at this airport: 74% single-engine and 26% multi-engine.

With the 15th (Scottish) Division, the brigade saw active service on the Western Front in Belgium and France. The brigade command the following units in World War I: * 13th (Service) Battalion, Royal Scots (Lothian Regiment) * 7th (Service) Battalion, Royal Scots Fusiliers (until May 1916) * 6th/7th (Service) Battalion, Royal Scots Fusiliers (left February 1918) * 6th (Service) Battalion, Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders * 11th (Service) Battalion, Princess Louise's (Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders) (until June 1918) * 45th Machine Gun Company, Machine Gun Corps (formed 12 February 1916, moved to 15th Battalion, Machine Gun Corps 17 March 1918) * 45th Trench Mortar Battery (formed 17 June 1916) * 1/8th Battalion, Princess Louise's (Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders) (from June 1918) The 7th (Service) Battalion, Royal Scots Fusiliers was an original member of the brigade. It merged with the 6th (Service) Battalion in May 1916 to form the 6th/7th Battalion. Second World War The brigade was reformed just before the Second World War, as the 45th Infantry Brigade. The brigade was a 2nd Line Territorial Army formation and was part of the 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division, which was the duplicate of the 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division and served in the Second World War. The brigade was formed as a duplicate of the 156th Infantry Brigade. It remained in the United Kingdom throughout the war and, in early January 1943, left the 15th Division and was replaced by 6th Guards Tank Brigade. The Brigade was then assigned to the 80th Infantry (Reserve) Division for training purposes. Once the 80th was disbanded, the brigade was assigned to the 38th Infantry (Reserve) Division whose control it remained under for the duration of the war. During the war, the brigade contained the following units: * 6th Battalion, Royal Scots Fusiliers (until 12 December 1939, rejoined 3 July 1940, left 27 December 1942) * 9th Battalion, Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) (until 27 December 1942) * 10th Battalion, Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) (until 22 July 1940) * 45th Infantry Brigade Anti-Tank Company (formed 1 September, disbanded 14 December 1940) * 10th Battalion, Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) (from 27 December 1942 until 21 July 1944) * 11th Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (from 28 December 1942 until 20 July 1944) * 4th Battalion, East Lancashire Regiment (from 23 July 1944) * 5th Battalion, Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers (from 23 July 1944) * 5th Battalion, Border Regiment (from 23 July 1944) References Category:Infantry brigades of the British Army in World War I Category:Infantry brigades of the British Army in World War II Category:Military units and formations of Scotland ","title":"45th Brigade (United Kingdom)"},{"id":"34548573","text":"Shaban (, also Romanized as Sha‚ÄòbƒÅn; also known as ShabƒÅndar) is a village in Chamsangar Rural District, Papi District, Khorramabad County, Lorestan Province, Iran.

His work centered on functional analysis. His two best known scientific monographs are titled Topological Vector Spaces (1966) and Banach Lattices and Positive Operators (1974). The first of these was subsequently translated into Spanish and Russian. The second made him an internationally recognized and leading scholar in this particular field of mathematics. (Roquette & Wolff, 2006) As teenager Helmut Schaefer attended the Sankt Afra boarding school in Meissen, Germany on a merit based scholarship. In 1943, then 18, he was recruited to serve as interpreter of Anglo-American intelligence. After the war he studied mathematics in Dresden and Leipzig, where he earned his doctorate in 1951 and his habilitation in 1954. Prof. Ernst H√∂lder served as his academic advisor. In 1956 he accepted an offer from the University of Halle (Saale) as professor of mathematics. Helmut Schaefer, his wife and two children escaped from East Germany to the Federal Republic in 1957, where for one year he worked under Prof. Gottfried K√∂the at the University of Mainz. In 1958 he became Associate Professor at Washington State University at Pullman and a few years later he, his wife and now three children moved on to the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. Then in 1963 he accepted an offer from the University of T√ºbingen in Germany where he remained until his retirement in 1990. Interrupting this period on several occasions and following retirement in T√ºbingen he spent a number of one-year terms or semesters as visiting or full professor at various American universities, including the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign, the University of Maryland at College Park, the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, Texas A&M; University at College Station, and Florida Atlantic University at Boca Raton. In T√ºbingen he served two terms as department head. He remained active in mathematical research until the year 1999, at which point he completely dedicated himself to his lifelong hobby of astronomy, especially astrophotography. In 1978, Helmut Schaefer was accepted as full member of the Mathematics and Natural Sciences Class of the Heidelberg Academy of Sciences. Earlier, he was admitted to the Academy of Sciences in Zaragoza (Spain). Over the years, he was able to attract many students to functional analysis, combining an expectation of high achievement with a tolerant, humorous, and factual attitude. Ten of his doctoral students went on to become professors at various universities in Germany and the U.S. (Roquette & Wolff, 2006) His doctoral students include , , and Bertram John Walsh.

Warren. It stars Glory Annen, Barry Stokes and Ava Cadell. Plot Aliens from Betelgeuse crash-land on Earth in their malfunctioning cargo ship. Their arrival draws the attention of four sexually-frustrated humans in a nearby park: Oliver and Prudence (a mild-mannered professional and his highly-strung fianc√©e), Willy (a bumbling shop assistant) and Cliff (a middle-aged man walking his dog). Oliver, Prudence, Willy and Cliff wander into the ship and encounter its all- female crew: engineer Partha, nurse Cosia and the captain, known as Skipper. Willy inadvertently drops some pornographic magazines that he has just bought. The aliens mistake a herd of approaching cows for a hostile force and hurriedly take off despite the computer's warnings about the fragile state of the ship's systems. Resuming their original course, the aliens study their guests in detail. Fascinated by the anatomy of the males, they decide to sell them to a zoo for exotic lifeforms on a distant planet. They also debate the significance of the acts depicted in Willy's magazines. Partha is particularly keen to emulate them and enthusiastically has sex with Cliff. However, Cliff soon regrets this decision as he physically cannot keep up with the energetic Partha, who has gained an extreme liking for sex and wants to have it with him non-stop, forcing Cliff to flee the room. Skipper, Cosia and Partha subject the males to a series of tests to learn more about their abilities. Oliver and Cliff fail miserably, but Willy, searching for his magazines, beats Skipper's combat simulation by unknowingly evading her attacks, causing her to collapse with exhaustion. While conducting a physical examination on Willy, Cosia discovers that his biology is more advanced than anything known to their species. Intriguing Cosia with exaggerated claims about his sexual prowess, Willy loses his virginity to her. Later, he passes an intelligence test by a fluke and has sex with Partha. In the ship's recreation area, Oliver seeks relationship advice from an artificial intelligence resembling a Wurlitzer jukebox. At the Wurlitzer's suggestion, he adopts a \\"caveman\\" approach to seducing Prudence. Shocked by her fianc√©'s behaviour, Prudence runs to a luxurious bedroom, where she immediately relaxes and willingly has sex with him. Meanwhile, Cliff tries to avoid Partha's advances but ends up getting himself trapped in a chair-like machine that the aliens use for sexual intercourse, which causes him excruciating pain. Awed by Willy's assumed physical and intellectual superiority, the aliens propose to return the others to Earth but take him with them. Willy is reluctant to leave his planet behind but agrees when Skipper, wanting to confirm Cosia and Partha's findings for herself, allows him to seduce her. The ship touches down safely and Oliver, Prudence and Cliff depart. However, the subsequent launch causes a fatal overload and the ship explodes, killing Willy and the three aliens. The disembodied voices of the computer and the Wurlitzer are left stranded in space.

Warren had moved away from sex comedies and gone on to direct the horror films Satan's Slave , Prey and Terror. Outer Touch was inspired by Close Encounters of the Third Kind: the original script, presented to Warren by producer David Speechley, was called \\"S.E.C.K.\\" (Sexual Encounters of the Close Kind). Warren, who found the script \\"funny but very corny\\", agreed to direct the film on the condition that he be allowed to revise the story. The title \\"Outer Touch\\" is a play on the expression \\"out of touch\\". Warren describes the film as a cross between a Carry On and Fire Maidens from Outer Space (1956). Production began on 22 January 1979 and ran for four weeks. The film was largely shot at Twickenham Studios and Bray Studios with the outdoor opening scenes being filmed on location in Marble Hill Park, Twickenham. The section of spaceship that appears in the park scenes was created with scaffolding covered with plastic sheets. The way in which these scenes were lit was meant as a pastiche of Close Encounters of the Third Kind. The scale model shots of the ship in flight were taken from the TV series Space: 1999. Due to the variety of shots used the appearance of the ship changes over the course of the film. According to Warren, Barry Stokes, whom he had first directed in Prey (1977), based his performance as Oliver partly on Christopher Reeve's portrayal of Clark Kent in Superman (1978). Release and reception Warren has called the film \\"dreadful in a nice sort of way\\". In the United States, the film was released as Spaced Out by the newly-founded Miramax, which re-edited the film to include new voice-overs and music and an upbeat ending. Warren, who was not consulted on these changes, says the only alteration he \\"really liked\\" was the new title, as he had thought Outer Touch to be \\"quite negative-sounding\\". =Critical response= In a contemporary review, John Pym of The Monthly Film Bulletin described the film as a \\"slap-and-tickle shoestring parody\\" that \\"gratifyingly lacks any of the usual directorial knowingness\\" and whose cast \\"achieve a kind of capering charm.\\" TV Guide calls the film \\"amateurish\\". Radio Times rates it one star out of five. Review website DVD Drive-In comments: \\"Just be thankful that this ends well before the 80-minute mark, and that Warren went back to the horror genre.\\" In contrast, The New York Times describes the music as \\"agreeable, the sex flippant and the dialogue, by Bob Saget, Jeff de Hart and Andrew Payne, fairly funny.\\" Home video The film remained unavailable on any home video format until 2008, when the original UK cut (bearing the American title \\"Spaced Out\\") was released on DVD by Odeon Entertainment. Prior to its DVD release the film had never been shown on UK television.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. History The settlement of Neillsville began when James O'Neill and his companions cut a road up through the forest from Black River Falls in June 1845. They built a sawmill on the bank of O'Neill Creek and began cutting pine and floating it downstream to their mill. The loggers prospered, more settlers came, and by 1860 the population approached 250. Businesses developed along Main Street, which is now called Hewett Street. The earliest were wood frame buildings. The first brick structure in town (and in Clark County) was built in 1872, and is in the district - the Hewett and Woods General Store at 502 Hewett Street - the blue building on the left in the photo. Its brick is probably the \\"soft brick\\" produced locally by King and Vine. Though it is early and simple, its style shows some Italianate influence. This first brick building was called \\"the Brick Store\\" for years. Continuing up the west side of Hewett street, and to the right in the photo: * The Lowe Brothers building at 508 Hewett is a graceful brick building with Romanesque arches and a cast iron cornice, built in 1896. Starting in 1927 the building housed a Red Owl grocery store. * The Bast Bakery at 510 Hewett is another brick Italianate building with cornice, built around 1890, which originally housed a meat and flour store. * The August Snyder Clothing Store at 518 Hewett is another brick Italianate building with cornice, this one built in 1900. It has a second-story bay window which projects above the sidewalk. * The Clark County Bank building at 522 Hewett was built in 1887, then expanded and elaborated to Queen Anne style with a clipped gable, iron cornice, and brick corbels. * The Sniteman Drug store at 528 Hewett is a striking brick Italianate building with metal cornice - the tallest on the block. Charles C. Sniteman was a New Yorker who trained at the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy. He came to Neillsville in 1879 to manage the Henry Meyer Drug Store and bought it in 1891. In 1895 he added the second story to a previous building and redid the front, producing the building we see today. Sniteman invented a fly spray used by farmers and a \\"blue ointment used in lumber camps to repel lice.\\" * The Commercial State Bank at 534 Hewett was built of red brick in 1887 and housed a dry goods and grocery store. In 1917 the Commercial State Bank remodeled the facade into a more dignified Classical Revival style, with a central opening framed in limestone blocks. The opening originally contained multipaned windows and decorative panels; today the upper part has been filled with wood. * The Neillsville Bank at 538 Hewett was built in 1887 as a red brick general store with a corner entrance, and was known as the Gates Block. In 1909 the bank remodeled the exterior to Commercial Prairie Style, covering it with tan brick and limestone trim and moving the entrance to the middle of the east side. Around the corner behind the Neillsville Bank, at 118 W 6th Street is the Varieties Store, built in 1886. It has simple Commercial Italianate details and a coal chute on the front. Returning up the east side of Hewett Street: * The Mark Kappelan Block at 551 Hewett was built in 1893, housing a drug store which faced onto Hewett Street, a barber shop behind that, and a saloon in back. Squarish arches in the brick frame the second story windows. In 1897 the building was refaced and decorated with the iron cornice and window treatments. * Emery Bruley's Men's Clothing Store at 541 Hewett was built in 1882 in Commercial Italianate style. Bruley was a Canadian who started a blacksmith shop in Neillsville, then opened a clothes store. This building initially housed Bruley's clothing store, a cigar store, a saloon at street level and a cigar factory on the second floor. Bruley also invented the Bruley steel fence post and built the north half of what is now called the Tufts Mansion at 26 Hewett in 1885. * The Republican Press at 531 Hewett is another Commercial Italianate building with cornice, built in 1895. It served as post office. * The Dewhurst Block at 521 Hewett is another red brick Commercial building, this one built in 1891. It housed a general store and in more recent years the Coast to Coast Hardware. It was built by Richard Dewhurst, an attorney, state legislator, and later head of the Neillsville Bank across the street. Dewhurst also added the south half to what is now called the Tufts Mansion. * Hein & Beaulieu's Dry Goods Store at 517 Hewett, built in 1897, is a Commercial Italianate building with Queen Anne influences and an ornate bracketed cornice.

Anne was the youngest daughter of high court judge Sir Malcolm Macnaghten and grew up in Northern Ireland and Kensington, London. She began her violin studies at the age of six with Hungarian soloist Jelly d'Ar√°nyi. Macnaghten later stated in an interview with The Strad that d'Ar√°nyi \\"wasn't really a very good teacher\\". At the age of seventeen she travelled to Germany to study at Leipzig Conservatory (now University of Music and Theatre Leipzig) with German pedagogue Walther Davisson, who later became the director of the conservatory. In 1931 she co- founded the Macnaghten Concerts together with composer Elisabeth Lutyens and conductor Iris Lemare, which aimed to promote contemporary classical composers. The concert series was based at the Mercury Theatre, Notting Hill Gate and originally ran from 1931‚Äì1937. In the same year Macnaghten founded the (then all-female) Macnaghten String Quartet, which played in many of the series' concerts. The quartet premi√®red works of several well-known composers as part of the concert series, including Sinfonietta, Op. 1 by Benjamin Britten in 1933, Tippet's String Quartet No. 1 in 1935 and works by Gerald Finzi, Elizabeth Maconchy, and Alan Rawsthorne. The Macnaghten String Quartet are still an active quartet and regularly coach chamber music at Benslow Music Trust. In 1952, with the help of composer Ralph Vaughan Williams (a strong supporter of the original concert series) and funding from the Arts Council of Great Britain (now Arts Council England), Macnaghten was able to revive the concert series, which was renamed the New Macnaghten Concerts and ran for over forty years, the last concert given in 1994. The New Macnaghten Concerts saw the premi√®re of works by British composers such as Harrison Birtwhistle and Richard Rodney Bennett. The recital series saw performances by some of the most internationally renowned musicians of the era, including John Williams, Cecil Aronowitz, Peter Pears, Steve Reich, Michael Nyman, Derek Simpson, Thea King and many others. From the late 1970s onwards, she taught violin in Hertfordshire, stopping only as a result of a fall aged ninety. Macnaghten received a Gold Medal from the Worshipful Company of Musicians in 1962, and in 1987 was appointed a CBE in recognition of her work in taking the Macnaghten Quartet into schools in Ealing, Cambridgeshire and particularly Hertfordshire.

Warren. The plot concerns a carnivorous alien (Barry Stokes) landing on Earth and befriending a lesbian couple (Glory Annen and Sally Faulkner) as part of his mission to evaluate humans as a source of food. It was filmed in under two weeks on a budget of less than ¬£60,000 in various locations near Shepperton Studios in Surrey. It had a limited distribution on release. Critical response to the film has been mixed: verdicts range from \\"odd\\", \\"bizarre\\" or \\"eccentric\\" to \\"ambitious\\" and \\"experimental\\", while the film's \\"claustrophobic\\" atmosphere has drawn both praise and criticism. Prey has also attracted commentary for its presentation of conflicting male and female sexuality, with some critics noting similarities to the plot of D. H. Lawrence's 1922 novella The Fox. It has been compared to a vampire or zombie film and has also been cited as an example of the exploitation (or sexploitation) genre. Plans for a sequel, Human Prey, were abandoned. Plot At night, a carnivorous, shape-shifting alien named Kator lands in the woods of rural England. The vanguard of an invasion force, his mission is to evaluate the suitability of humans as a source of food for his species. Stumbling across Anderson and Sandy, a couple having a tryst in their parked car, he kills both and assumes the appearance of Anderson. The next morning, he encounters Jessica-Ann and Josephine, a lesbian couple who live in a nearby manor house. Although Jessica owns the property, having inherited it from her Canadian parents, the dominant of the pair is Jo, who is unusually possessive of Jessica and deeply suspicious of men. Simon, Jessica's boyfriend, has mysteriously disappeared. The women are vegetarians and live in seclusion with only a few chickens and a pet parrot, Wally, for company. Calling himself Anders, and feigning an injured leg, Kator is taken in by Jessica and Jo. His arrival immediately causes friction between the two. Bored of her monotonous existence, Jessica welcomes the stranger's arrival. Jo, however, openly resents his presence and suggests that the socially-awkward Anders is an escapee from a psychiatric hospital (which she is herself). Later, having returned to the spot where he killed Anderson and Sandy, Kator kills and partly devours two policemen who are examining the couple's abandoned car. Back at the house, Jessica finds a knife and bloodstained clothes in a spare bedroom; recognising the latter as Simon's, she realises that he was murdered by Jo. The next morning, Jo is furious to discover that all the chickens have been slaughtered. Blaming a local fox, she lays traps for the animal and goes after it with a rifle, assisted by Jessica and Kator. When the hunt fails, Kator tracks and kills the fox on his own and presents it to Jessica and Jo as a trophy. The trio celebrate with a champagne party for which Jo dresses Kator in drag. A subsequent game of hide-and-seek brings out more of the hunter in Kator. Later, Jo is disturbed to find the fox carcass stripped bare and realises that the animal was not caught in a trap as she and Jessica thought. Jessica angrily rejects her warnings about Anders, interpreting Jo's fear as jealousy and revealing that she knows the truth about Simon. The next morning, Jo arms herself with her knife and stalks Kator as he hunts swans on a nearby river. Her attempt to eliminate him is thwarted when he starts to drown, alerting Jessica with his screams. Jessica and Jo rescue Kator and take him back to the house. While the two women clean themselves up, Kator kills and consumes Wally. Jessica tells Jo that she is no longer willing to be controlled and is leaving with Anders. Outraged, Jo knocks Jessica unconscious and runs into the woods to dig a grave for her. On waking, Jessica seduces Kator. As they start to have sex, Kator's predatory instincts are stirred, causing him to revert to his natural form and tear open Jessica's throat, killing her. Having returned to the house, Jo attempts to flee but falls into the open grave just as Kator catches up with her, and she screams as the scene fades to black. Some time later, Kator leaves the house and calls his mother ship on an alien transceiver. Hungrily watching two girls walk along the river, he advises his superiors to dispatch more of his kind to Earth. Cast *Barry Stokes as Kator and Anderson *Glory Annen as Jessica-Ann *Sally Faulkner as Josephine *Sandy Chinney as Sandy *Eddie Stacey and Jerry Crampton as Policemen *Kelly Marcel as Girl (uncredited) *Derek Kavanagh as Radio DJ (voice only; uncredited) Themes According to Jim Reed of the Psychotronic Film Society of Savannah, Georgia, Prey \\"finds unexpected vantage points for subtle commentary on the themes of sexism, love, adultery, betrayal and racism ‚Äî all within the context of a gay-alien-zombie-vampire gore-fest\\". Critic Steve Chibnall describes the film as a \\"dark Darwinian fable\\" that, while \\"eccentric and sometimes unintentionally humorous ... offers a serious discourse on the predatory nature of masculinity.\\" Leon Hunt, author of British Low Culture: from Safari Suits to Sexploitation, further analyses the conflict of gender roles and sexualities in Prey. He argues that through the character of Jo, Prey establishes itself as one of a number of 1970s British horror films in which country houses are depicted as places of \\"dangerous female sexuality ‚Äì bisexual or lesbian, unstable or jealous, murderous and castrating\\". In this respect, he considers the film misogynistic. Jo's sexuality is rivalled by Kator's \\"carnivorous masculinity\\" ‚Äì which, as shown during Jessica's death scene, \\"grows out of the 'natural' sexual play between hunter and prey\\". Hunt observes that Kator, though a predator, is not invulnerable in this hostile world of femininity: his near-drowning could be seen as a \\"threatening immersion in the feminine\\". Noting that Jessica and Jo, as vegetarians, are effectively herbivores who both fall victim to Kator, Hunt describes Prey as a \\"competing carnivore movie\\" whose ultimate aim is \\"gender restoration\\" at any cost. For Jeremy Heilman of the Online Film Critics Society, Kator serves as a \\"blunt metaphor for the threat that male figures pose to lesbian relationships\\". The film has been compared by both Hunt and critic Ian Cooper to D.H. Lawrence's 1922 novella The Fox, a story of metaphorical predation in which the implied lesbian relationship between two women, Banford and March, is disrupted by the unexpected arrival of a soldier called Henry. According to Hunt, plot elements shared by the two works include the \\"enclosed world\\" of the women's chicken farm and the way in which their lifestyle of \\"homoerotic seclusion\\" comes under threat ‚Äì not only from the fox that slaughters their poultry but also from the handsome male stranger whose presence finally leads one of the women into \\"heterosexual temptation\\". Cooper suggests that the film also pastiches Jos√© Ram√≥n Larraz's film Vampyres (1974). Adam Locks argues that Prey evokes a \\"mythic English past\\" through its characterisation, setting, cinematography and music; these aspects serve to de-emphasise the importance of modern technology and collectively represent a \\"disavowal of the modern\\". He believes that the film conveys a strong sense of isolation, noting that the lesbian characters of Jessica and Jo live as social outcasts and that their remote rural home represents \\"a breakaway from the modern industrial world\\". According to Locks, the slow-motion drowning scene, which is accompanied by a \\"dark and brooding\\" combination of synthesiser and piano, symbolises a \\"deep anxiety over technological and economic expansion since the 1960s\\" and constitutes a \\"hysterical reaction to the intrusiveness of modern cultural change\\". More broadly, Locks identifies Prey as an example of an English surrealist tradition started by Lewis Carroll's 1865 novel Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and sustained by works such as the TV series The Avengers ‚Äì which, like Prey, is set in a \\"mythic\\" England that bears little relation to the real world. Production Prey took a total of ten weeks to make. The story was conceived by producers Terry Marcel and David Wimbury and developed by Quinn Donoghue. At the start of May 1977, Marcel pitched it to Warren, who was fascinated by the idea and quickly agreed to direct. Warren has since described the film as his \\"most hectic\\" production but also considers it to have been \\"a lot of fun\\". Max Cuff, a journalist in his twenties, was hired to write a script based on Marcel and Wimbury's outline. Prey was made on a budget of approximately ¬£50,000 in deferred payments and ¬£3,000 cash. Warren agreed to shoot the film in ten days starting on 23 May, giving him just three weeks for pre-production. He remembers that during this time \\"everyone was working flat out ‚Äì there wasn't any sitting around waiting.\\" The cast were supplied by a single talent agency, which also invested in the film: CCA Management, founded by Howard Pays. Prey was the film debut of Glory Annen, who had graduated from drama school the year before. She and Barry Stokes later appeared in Outer Touch (1979), also directed by Warren. Not all of the cast were professional actors: Sandy Chinney was the girlfriend of the second assistant director, while the two girls who appear in the final scene were played by Marcel's daughters. Due to budget constraints, some of the cast, including Annen, supplied their own wardrobe. Marcel provided Warren with a filming slot on the wooded backlot of Shepperton Studios, located on the River Ash. Several scenes feature a bridge that had previously appeared in Dr. Terror's House of Horrors (1965). In addition, production designer Hayden Pearce secured the use of the manor house in Littleton Park (the studios' original site) to serve as the location of Jessica and Jo's country home. Of the filming arrangements, Warren comments: \\"This really was quite a unique situation because ... here we were in a studio looking at a real house and real rooms as if shooting on location.\\" The crew were permitted to redecorate the rooms as necessary and, to this end, make use of any of the items in the studios' prop store. Warren states that this resulted in a \\"crazy\\" mixture of decors that \\"certainly helped create the right atmosphere\\" for the film. Filming commenced after only half a day's rehearsal and without a finished script; the actors received the rest of their lines in daily dispatches. According to Warren, \\"dear old Max Cuff was trying to keep up with us. He was writing like mad.\\" Certain scenes were partly or wholly improvised: one example is a sex scene between the characters of Jessica and Jo, which was added mainly to boost the film's overseas distribution prospects. Many of the crew had recently come off the production of The Pink Panther Strikes Again, on which Marcel had served as assistant director. They completed an average of 35 camera set-ups per day, employing hand-held shots whenever they fell behind schedule and filming scenes in no more than three takes to lower costs. Stokes needed injections to ease the discomfort caused by the contact lenses that he was required to wear as part of his alien make-up. The bird Wally was a cockatoo that often refused to perform when needed and squawked loudly off-camera, frequently causing problems with the sound recording. He eventually escaped from his cage and was never seen again. The outdoor shooting was helped by the weather, which was sunny and warm throughout. This inspired Warren to direct the film in a \\"leisurely\\" manner while maintaining an \\"underlying sense of tension and uncertainty\\" to create a more shocking finale. Warren considers the premise of the film to be \\"intimate\\" and situation-driven, arguing that the light script and small cast allowed the characters to develop naturally as the shooting progressed. Stuntmen Jerry Crampton and Eddie Stacey filmed their scenes in about two hours. The scene in which Jessica and Jo save Kator from drowning in the river was among the first to be shot and presented difficulties for the crew. The Ash had been used as a waste dump for many years, causing the water to stagnate; according to Warren it looked \\"more like crude oil\\". In addition, Annen was unable to swim. To keep Stokes, Annen and Faulkner in the water for as little time as possible, Warren reduced the amount of footage that needed to be shot by having the scene filmed in slow-motion on a high-speed camera. Once out of the water, the actors were given precautionary tetanus injections. Marcel was highly impressed with the footage and insisted that Alan Jones, the film's editor, leave the scene uncut despite Warren's concerns that it was too long. The production ended with the filming of Anderson and Sandy's deaths; this scene was shot night-for-night as the last day's filming had run into the early hours of the next morning. To reduce costs, no alien spacecraft is seen at the start of the film; instead, Kator's arrival is conveyed solely by flashing lights and sound effects. As the low budget also precluded the use of an orchestra, composer Ivor Slaney devised a synthesised score featuring occasional contributions from traditional instruments (such as a piano) that he recorded himself. Slaney also composed for Warren's next film, Terror (1978). The soundtracks for Prey and Terror were released jointly on CD in 2009. Release Prey was distributed by Supreme in the UK, where the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) cleared it for cinema release in November 1977. Unspecified cuts were required for the film to be awarded an X certificate. In London, Prey was screened alongside the 1973 Western Charley One-Eye as half of a double feature. The film was re-rated 18 prior to its first home video release in 1986. Critical reception In a contemporary review, Tom Milne of The Monthly Film Bulletin suggested that the film's \\"pleasantly outrageous\\" theme \\"would have been more appealing treated with the sense of humour loudly called for by its most promising notions\\". However, he also noted the \\"attractive settings and photography\\" and the \\"very creditable performances\\" of the lead actors. Over the years reactions to the film have remained mixed. Kim Newman, writing for Video Watchdog in 2005, describes Prey as the \\"most minimal of Warren's exploitation films, and among the strangest British movies of all time\\", arguing that it plays like \\"a reverse spoof; the material could have been absurd and comical, with a succession of very dark jokes, but the treatment (especially the performances) is serious to the point of solemnity.\\" In a 2009 review on moviemartyr.com, Jeremy Heilman praises the film, describing it as a \\"solid B-movie effort\\", \\"slyly humorous\\" and \\"disturbing\\". He argues that ‚Äì partly by necessity, due to its low budget ‚Äì Prey is more \\"character-driven\\" than most other science-fiction horror films, and praises the sustained tension and \\"distinctive\\" dynamics of the plot. His one major criticism is the cinematography and editing, which he considers \\"less than expertly done\\"; the drowning scene, for example, is prolonged \\"to the point of unintentional hilarity\\". Newman and James Marriott, authors of Horror! The Definitive Companion to the Most Terrifying Movies Ever Made, view this sequence as one of several \\"incomprehensible stylistic flourishes\\", while Kevin Lyons of the British Film Institute calls it \\"excruciating\\". Lyons is nevertheless complimentary of Prey as whole, judging it a \\"nicely claustrophobic melodrama\\" and one of several \\"overlooked\\" British science- fiction horror films of the 1970s. Cooper describes Prey as a \\"defiantly odd low-fi sci-fi film\\". Writing for the Savannah Morning News, Reed gives a mostly positive assessment: he describes the film as \\"flawed\\" yet \\"ambitious and somewhat mesmerizing\\", as well as \\"experimental\\". Peter Hutchings considers the film \\"bizarre\\" but adds that the \\"sustained seriousness\\" of Warren's direction and the \\"doom-filled atmosphere\\" save Prey from becoming a \\"piece of camp nonsense\\". Fred Beldin of AllMovie is critical, summing up Prey as a \\"dismal, unsettling film\\" with \\"occasional arthouse pretensions\\" that is \\"difficult to watch even for exploitation fans\\". He notes the film's unrelenting tension and \\"claustrophia\\", remarking: \\"deaths seem like appropriate punctuation at the end of a miserable sentence, giving the film a grim tone of hopelessness that few will derive pleasure from\\". He criticises Sally Faulkner's performance as being \\"particularly grating\\". By contrast, Newman and Marriott praise the \\"surprisingly good turns\\" from Stokes, Annen and Faulkner. Abandoned sequel Shortly after the film's release, Warren, Marcel and scriptwriter Quentin Christopher commenced work on a sequel with the provisional title Human Prey. According to Warren, this would have opened with Kator meeting more potential victims in a pub; later, the aliens would have arrived en masse to \\"farm humans like cattle\\". Marcel has compared the proposed plot to that of Starship Troopers. The idea was ultimately abandoned due to the limited distribution of the original.

The company was purchased in January 2019 by Frasers Group (formerly Sports Direct International) for \\"a nominal sum\\".  History  Sofa.com was founded by Pat Reeves and Rohan Blacker when they paid $215,000 for the domain name sofa.com. It was agreed that Reeves would buy the domain in cash and would meet the seller in New York to complete the transaction. On the day Reeves refused to pay cash and informed the seller he would only pay via wire transfer. The seller reluctantly agreed, and provided bank details, purportedly of the company he was employed by. In fact, the bank details were his own and $200,000 were transferred into his account in November 2005. He absconded to South America, but the money ran out ten months later and the seller was charged with theft greater than $10,000. Blacker and Reeves sought a business venture that required fewer staff, fewer physical premises and a product with a higher basket value, and a long shelf life. They believed that furniture could be sold online with a promise of completely free returns if the customer, for whatever reason, rejected the goods.

Ship history The ship was built by Alexander Stephen and Sons of Linthouse for the Elder Dempster Lines, and launched on 11 February 1902. On 10 April 1918 the Burutu (which was defensively armed) was damaged by the German U-boat . The U-boat was fought off by gunfire 14 miles south-south-west off Cape Mesurado in Liberia, West Africa. Two members of the Burutus crew were killed. The Captain, H.A. Yardley, was awarded the Distinguished Service Order and Seaman Edward Jones was given a gold medal by the passengers. With the Burutu damaged, arrangements were made for a temporary refit in Freetown, Sierra Leone, and for the return of the vessel to Liverpool. However, while in the Irish Sea, the 3,863 ton Burutu was struck on the port side by the stern of the 7,653 ton City of Calcutta, and is said to have sunk within ten minutes. About 160 persons, including the Master and officers and others on watch, lost their lives. The two vessels were travelling in separate convoys, and, in accordance with Admiralty orders, were steaming without lights. The collision took place at night in stormy weather. Casualties as listed by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) are as follows: Frederick Austin Blythe (First Mate) from West Hartlepool, W.G. Blackburn (Junior Engineer), Herbert F. Chadwell (Signalman) from Sussex, William Grice (Ordinary Seaman) from Bristol, William E. Hollis (Ordinary Seaman) from Ilkeston, Derbyshire, F.J. Liddell, L. Mathieson (Foreman) from Glasgow, C.E.C. Sorenson from Sunderland, Jacob Bussey (Leading Seaman) from Newfoundland living in Middlesbrough. Casualties as listed in the Western Times in October 1918 are as follows: Captain Potter, Chief Officer Clark, Chief Engineer Goddard. Newspapers reported that there was a gale and a heavy sea at the time of the tragedy. The reports stated that there was perfect discipline aboard, and that the suddenness of the disaster and the hostile elements prevented lifesaving. Reports at the time indicated that there were 42 survivors and that although the first lifeboat escaped the second capsized. Survivors witnessed the crowded decks at the time the ship sank. All officers were lost. A memorial is dedicated to the men who died and whose graves are not known or cannot be maintained in St Saviours church, Lagos, Nigeria.

Located near the Cooper River, the neighborhood has a population of 4,494. Our Lady of Lourdes Medical Center and Harleigh Cemetery are located in the neighborhood.  History  = Founding = The Parkside Land Company officially opened the sale of lots for residential use on July 17, 1899. The neighborhood was sparsely populated until the early 20th century when Camden's industrial expansion required more neighboring housing. One realty group, Smith-Austermuhl Company, was responsible for contributing to the development of the Wildwood Avenue of Parkside. The Camden-Haddonfield trolley line bolstered the appeal of the growing neighborhood. = 20th century = Being recognized as a street-car suburb of Camden, the trajectories of Parkside and Camden are closely tied. Deindustrialization cut Camden's manufacturing sector drastically in the 1950s and 1960s. This had a ripple effect on the neighborhood which housed the industrial workers of Camden. The demographic change of the Parkside neighborhood occurred in the post-WWII and post-deindustrialization period in which white flight, blockbusting, and slum clearance all played a part.  Education  = Forest Hill Elementary School = The school opened in September 1969 and is located on Wildwood avenue and Park boulevard. Forest Hill Elementary serves grades kindergarten through fifth. = Cooper B. Hatch Junior High School = Cooper B. Hatch Junior High School was opened in 1924. It was constructed to combat the over-crowding which was affecting Camden City schools. In 2016, the Camden Big Picture Learning Academy moved in the Cooper B. Hatch building. The move was made to combat the discomfort that the growing size of the Academy felt in the smaller and older building with the added benefit of providing students with an auditorium and a gymnasium. = Camden High School = Camden High School was founded in 1891 in the then Forest Hill (now Farnham Park) area. = Camden Big Picture Learning Academy = Formerly Met-East High school. The academy was located on Kaighn Avenue near Farnham Park before their relocation to Park boulevard.  Landmarks  Our Lady of Lourdes as seen from the corner of Vesper Boulevard and Haddon Avenue. = Our Lady of Lourdes Medical Center = The land where Virtua Our Lady of Lourdes occupies was originally in possession of Bartholomew J. Eustace who \\"turned over the land\\" in September 1947. The building of the hospital increased the number of hospital beds in the county which was far below the United States Public Health service minimum recommendation. In August 2017, Cooper Health Systems reached a deal to purchase the hospital system for $135 million. The merger failed and as a result in December 2018, Cooper sought legal action against Our Lady of Lourdes to regain its $15 million deposit. In June 2018, Virtua, a local healthcare system, agreed to purchase the Lourdes Health System. A deal which was approved from state and county regulators on July 1, 2019.https://www.modernhealthcare.com/mergers-acquisitions/virtua-buys-two-nj- hospitals-trinity-health = Harleigh Cemetery = The Harleigh Cemetery Company was founded on April 28, 1885. The tract of land which it occupies was previously owned by Isaac Cooper, a member of the influential Cooper family. The cemetery officially opened on August 10, 1886. In 2012, the cemetery began to provide free interment to Camden County veterans by providing 10,000 burial lots. = Donkey's Place = Donkey's Place storefront. Donkey's Place is an acclaimed restaurant which specializes the regional fast food item of cheesesteaks. Established in 1943 by Leon Lucas, the restaurant came into regional and national prominence after famed chef Anthony Bourdain claimed it was the best place in the region to get a cheesesteak on his TV show Parts Unknown. Donkey's Place has appeared on TV shows such as The Goldbergs. = Farnham Park = Farnham Park playground. The park began as an initiative from the Women's Park association. They began to lobby the City council to purchase the land in the Red Hill for a public park in May 1901. The land was owned by the Parkside Land and Improvement Company. The Park associations plea was heard and negotiations went underway but quickly reached an impasse between the City council and the Parkside Land and Improvement company over the price of the land. The proposed land purchase became politicized resulting in Mayor Nowrey resigning from office rather than signing the purchasing bill of the land. The purchase was completed in 1904 for the price of $90,000. The park was renamed to Farnham Park on December 1, 1927 to honor the Levi Farnham, the city engineer of 30 years. For 30 years, the park was also home to a George Washington statue which was moved downtown in the 1980s due to continued vandalism. In 1966, the park was strongly considered as a possible location for the main campus location for what would become Camden County College. The debate was contentious between those for and against the park hosting the campus. Pro-campus advocates argued that if the campus was not to be built then something which would generate tax revenue should while detractors argued that removing the park would be akin to removing Central Park from New York City. The campus ended up being located on the grounds of a seminary in Blackwood. The park has been subject to destructive weather events most notably Tropical Storm Doria in August 1971 which damaged a levee and left the park flooded for decades. The park received major renovations in 2011 which would help combat against future flooding. The park is the largest in the city covering a total of 71 acres. The Farnham-Cooper Bikeway was a planned addition to the Cooper River Greenway which connects the two parks. On June 11, 2020, the park's Christopher Columbus statue, which had been vandalized with red paint and beheaded,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/demonstrators- lop-off-head-of-christopher-columbus-statue-in-new-jersey-2020-06-12 was removed.https://6abc.com/farnham-park-camden-nj-new-jersey/6243739/ An attempt by protestors to block the truck carrying the removed statue also resulted in the statue falling onto to the ground and breaking into several pieces.https://6abc.com/farnham-park-camden-nj-new-jersey/6243739/ At the time of its removal, the statue was one of 43 Christopher Columbus statues and monuments located throughout the state of New Jersey.https://www.fox29.com/news/christopher-columbus-statue-removed-from- farnham-park-in-camden References Category:Neighborhoods in Camden, New Jersey ","title":"Parkside, Camden"},{"id":"34548907","text":"Pyne Point is a neighborhood in the northern part of Camden, New Jersey.

Women creators have worked in every genre, from superheroes to romance, westerns to war, crime to horror. In certain countries, like Japan and South Korea, women creators have shaken up the traditional market and attained widespread mainstream success. Americas =United States= Newspaper comics In the early 20th century, when the US newspaper comics market was in its infancy, William Randolph Hearst brought the artist Nell Brinkley over from the competing Denver Post, and although not doing comics herself, her romantic and glamorous imagery became an inspiration to a generation of female comics artists. Another style popular around the time was cute comics with doll-like round-cheeked children. In 1909, Rose O'Neill created The Kewpies, a series continuing for decades and widely used in various marketing purposes. Another cartoonist, Grace Wiederseim (also known as Grace Drayton and Grace Gebbie),Grace Drayton at the Lambiek Comiclopedia worked in a similar vein and, from the 1910s until the 1930s, created a multitude of series with cherubic children bearing names such as Toodles, Dimples, Dolly Dingle, and Dottie Darling. She was also the creator of the \\"Campbell kids\\", which Campbell Soup employed for marketing purposes up until the 1930s. Her sister, Margaret G Hays was also a frequent collaborator with her on several of her works. In the 1910s, newspaper cartoonist Fay King was drawing early autobiographical comics in The Denver Post and Cartoons Magazine. Edwina Dumm created a long-lasting series in 1918, Cap Stubbs and Tippie, about a boy and a dog, although the frisky dog soon took over the strip as its most popular character. The series ran until the 1960s. In the 1920s, the USA underwent an economic boom and widespread social change, leading to the appearance of the \\"flapper\\", a female subculture receiving a lot of media attention at the time. Flappers enjoyed partying, jazz music and free dating, and defied many of the social norms surrounding women at the time. Several female cartoonists picked up on the flapper stereotype, often working in a stylish art deco style, including Ethel Hays (with her comic strip Marianne and her famous cartoon Flapper Fanny), Virginia HugetVirginia Huget. Lambiek. (Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, Babs in Society), Gladys Parker (Gay and her Gang) and Marjorie Henderson Buell (Dashing Dot). In the 1930s, the great depression had struck the US, and stories about poor but happy families, and their stoic struggles to make a living, became popular reader fare. Martha Orr created one of the most successful series, Apple Mary, about an old lady selling apples around the neighborhood, in 1932. The accounts on the series' final fate differs. Most sources state that in 1938, she left it to her female assistant Dale Conner,Dale Conner. Lambiek. who renamed it Mary Worth, although King Features Syndicate's own account claims that Apple Mary folded and Mary Worth was its replacement. In 1940, a new writer Allen Saunders was brought in, and Conner and Saunders began signing the strip with the joint pseudonym \\"Dale Allen\\", which remained after Conner left the series. Mary Worth has proven a successful concept, and is still syndicated around the globe. In 1935, Marjorie Henderson Buell (signature \\"Marge\\") created the comic panel Little Lulu, later spawning a successful comic book series by John Stanley and Irving Tripp. This character inspired the name for the organization Friends of Lulu, an organization promoting reading and authoring of comics to girls and women. In 1940, veteran artist Dale Messick created the comic strip Brenda Starr, Reporter, about a glamorous reporter with a soap opera-like love life. After Messick left the series, it was continued solely by other female artists. In 1941, Tarp√© Mills created the superheroine strip Miss Fury for the Sunday pages. Striking a chord among the readers, she was drawing the strip until 1951.Trina Robbins (1993). A Century of Women Cartoonists, Northampton, Mass.: Kitchen Sink Press. (pp. 62, 67-71, 83). Jackie Ormes was the first nationally syndicated female black cartoonist with her series Torchy Brown, created in 1937 as a humoristic adventure strip lasting for three years, and picked up again in 1950 as Torchy Brown's Heartbeats, basically revamped as a black version of Brenda Starr, Reporter, with the young black eponymous character stumbling onto adventure after adventure, and going from one love interest to another, although the series also took up more serious subjects such as racial bigotry and environmental pollution.Robbins, 1993 (p. 113, 116-117, 176) The series never became a widespread success, since it was only picked up by black-owned newspapers. In the 1940s, teen comics became a popular genre. This was a rather down-to-earth genre, mostly comedy-inclined and marketed towards young teenage girls, where young, often gangly, teenagers went through different problems with the opposite sex and dating. Notable artists to mention include Hilda Terry (Teena, 1941), Marty Links (Emmy Lou, 1944) and Linda WalterLinda Walter. Lambiek. (Susie Q. Smith, together with her husband Jerry Walter on scripts). These three artists all had earlier works in the fashion field. In 1951, after some internal arguments within the organization, Terry became the first female cartoonist to be accepted to the National Cartoonists Society. Other successful strips include Cathy Guisewite's semi-autobiographical Cathy, about a neurotic city woman and her problems with shopping and romance, and Lynn Johnston's For Better or For Worse, about the Patterson household and their family relationships. Overtly feminist and containing much pointed social commentary in addition to character-based humor, Nicole Hollander's strip Sylvia is distributed nationally by Tribune Media Services, with 19 published books collecting strip selections. Sylvia's strong personality and forcefully critical views distinguish her from less assertive women cartoon characters. Due to the syndicates' often strict demands on recurring characters and an unwillingness to risk offending readers, some cartoonists have gone into self- syndication to maintain control of their work. Some long-running self- syndicated comics are the feminist Maxine or Laughing Gas by cartoonist and author Marian HenleyMarian Henley. Lambiek. (not to be confused with John M. Wagner's Hallmark character) and the surrealist Way Lay or Story Minute by underground veteran Carol Lay. Mainstream comic books Comic books, as well, have been produced by a number of female artists. One publisher in particular, Fiction House, used many female cartoonists, both on staff and through Eisner & Iger, one of the era's comics \\"packagers\\" that would supply comic books on demand to publishers testing the emerging medium. Action and adventure-oriented genres were popular at this time, and Fiction House's forte was capable and beautiful female protagonists, working as pilots, detectives, or jungle adventuresses. Women working for the publisher include Lily Ren√©e,Lily Ren√©e. Lambiek. at the Lambiek Comiclopedia Fran HopperFran Hopper. Lambiek Comiclopedia and future romance artists Ruth Atkinson and Ann Brewster. These stories were frequently written by a female writer, as well: Ruth Roche, later an editor. Before finding fame as a crime novelist, Patricia Highsmith wrote for Black Terror and other comic books. In the 1950s Marie Severin, sister of artist John Severin, was a frequent EC and Atlas/Marvel colorist, later drawing her own stories as well. Her cartoon style made her a frequent contributor to Marvel's Not Brand Echh satirical title of the late 1960s. Another prolific artist was Ramona Fradon, who drew Aquaman and was co- creator of Metamorpho. Later artists and writers include Ann Nocenti (creator of Typhoid Mary and Longshot), Louise Simonson (Power Pack writer), June Brigman (Power Pack artist), Gail Simone (Welcome to Tranquility), Devin Grayson (Batman writer), Becky Cloonan, the first female Batman artist,Beck, Laura (February 8, 2013). \\"Meet the First Lady to Draw Batman Since His Inception in 1939\\". Jezebel. Marjorie Liu (The Amazing X-Men writer), Sara Pichelli (Ultimate Spider-Man artist), G. Willow Wilson (Ms. Marvel), Amanda Conner (Power Girl artist), and Kelly Sue DeConnick (Pretty Deadly, Bitch Planet) at Image Comics. Underground, alternative and independent The underground comix movement attracted women artists, as it allowed more mature themes and personal work than the commercial newspaper and comic book industry of the time. A pioneer in this market was Trina Robbins, a driving force in the creation of the early all-female comix books It Ain't Me, Babe and All Girl Thrills, and later founder of the anthology series Wimmen's Comix. Robbins has written several books about female cartoonists and their comics. Another all-female comix book series was Tits & Clits Comix, founded by Lyn ChevelyLyn Chevely. Lambiek. and Joyce Farmer, who were inspired by the honesty in the underground comix, but appalled by the frequent male sexist perspective and attitude. With the conviction that sex was political, the series was created with the focus of sex and sexuality from a female perspective. Artists who grew out of this movement include Lee Marrs (Pudge Girl Blimp about an overweight self-obsessed wannabe hippie girl), Shary Flenniken (Trots and Bonnie about a precocious girl and her dog trying to make sense of their suburban life), Aline Kominsky (The Bunch, autobiographical depiction of her least flattering sides) and Dori Seda (autobiographical stories). After the underground scene turned into the alternative scene, women artists continued to focus on autobiographical work, such as Debbie Drechsler (Daddy's Girl, 1996, about incest and sexual abuse during childhood) and Phoebe Gloeckner (Diary of a Teenage Girl, 2002). The scene's unapologetic attitude also inspired artists outside the US, such as Canadian Julie Doucet, whose surrealist semi-autobiographical series Dirty Plotte became a worldwide cult favorite in the 1990s. The underground/alternative market allowed for a more open depiction of sexuality, and in the 1970s and 1980s openly lesbian and bisexual artists told their stories in comic book form, such as Mary Wings (artist of the first all-lesbian comix book Come Out Comix (1973)), Roberta Gregory (Bitchy Bitch, and frequent contributor to Gay Comix) and Alison Bechdel (Dykes to Watch Out For and graphic novel Fun Home, 2006). In the independent market, that began to appear from the 1970s, Wendy Pini, together with her husband Richard Pini, started the manga-inspired series Elfquest, which soon became a major sleeper hit. Colleen Doran created her cult space opera series A Distant Soil which was published in the early-1980s in small press fanzines, then self-published by Doran in the early-1990s, before moving to Image Comics in 1996. Other popular artists include Donna Barr (Desert Peach, about Erwin Rommel's fictional gay brother), Jill Thompson (Scary Godmother, a friendly witch in a Halloween environment) and Linda Medley (Castle Waiting, daily lives of fairytale characters). Webcomics Many female comic creators have found their fame in webcomics and later published hard copies of their work, such as Kate Beaton for Hark! A Vagrant!, and Allie Brosh's Hyperbole and a Half. Others, like Emily Carroll (known for the webcomic His Face All Red) went on to work on other multimedia projects, such as Carroll's Gone Home. Female webcomic artists include writers and illustrators such as Kate Leth (Canadian), Danielle Corsetto, Ramsey Beyer, Lucy Knisley, Abby Howard, Madeleine Flores (Adventure Time), Dorothy Gambrell, Liz Prince, and Erika Moen, who worked with Grace Ellis and Noelle Stevenson on the popular alternative print series Lumberjanes. Asia Countries with a large percentage of female comics creators include Japan and South Korea. =Japan= The first significant female manga artist was Machiko Hasegawa, creator of the family-oriented Sazae-san, which launched in 1946 in the newspaper Asahi Shimbun. It ran for several decades. Comics intended for girls (shoujo manga) have had a long history in Japan. They grew out of lifestyle magazines directed at girls and teenagers in the early 20th century. These magazines featured romantic short stories and fashionable illustrations, supervised by male editorial staff. In 1953 the \\"God of Manga\\" Osamu Tezuka published his classic Princess Knight, with a longer, more complex storyline and a gender ambiguous protagonist. This manga was a great influence on many Japanese women creators. The long-running monthly magazines Ribon and Nakayoshi appeared in the 1950s, and the weeklies Shojo Friend and Margaret appeared in 1963. Most of these early comics were written by men such as Tetsuya Chiba, Mitsuteru Yokoyama and Fujio Akatsuka. They failed to attract a wide readership. In the 1960s, Yoshiko Nishitani created works featuring glamorous teen girls in lead roles, with once-taboo romances as a central theme. This helped pave the way for a great wave in the late-1960s to early-1970s when a loose connection of women, later given the name year 24 group, merged Tezuka's \\"story manga\\" narratives with the romantic art style from the girls' lifestyle magazines and, in the process, revolutionized the genre, both in visual experimentation (including montage-like page layouts) and story subjects. Some of these artists such as Keiko Takemiya and Moto Hagio wrote stories featuring young gay male lovers involved in tragic relationships. These stories proved immensely popular and gave birth to the yaoi genre, still very popular. (Keiko Takemiya later made the popular sci-fi Toward the Terra.) Since then, girl comics have been a flourishing scene, which, in general, has both been created and read by women, has had a notable part of the market, and, as manga is becoming increasingly popular abroad, more and more is making an impact on Western countries. Later popular artists include the highly prolific and successful Rumiko Takahashi (drawing primarily shonen stories for boys), Hiromu Arakawa (Fullmetal Alchemist), Kazue Kato (Blue Exorcist) as well as the female collective Clamp. Japan doesn't only produce comics for children and adolescents, but also has a seinen (adult men) and a josei (adult women) scene, allowing more mature themes and storylines. Many of the artists working for this market have gained wide recognition among the alternative comics scenes in USA and Europe, including artists such as Kiriko Nananan, Moyoco Anno, Junko Mizuno and Kan Takahama. = South Korea = Korean comics are known as manhwa (similar etymologically to Japanese manga). In the 1950s and 1960s, the popularity of comics rose. The sunjeong (or soonjung) genre was created for female audiences and featured various romantic stories. The Korean Women Cartoonist Association (KWCA) served the women in the field. It was founded on December 2, 1997, and the website was active between 2001 and 2012. In 2019, the site was used for the Wooden Architecture Association. Europe Although a minority, there have been female artists working in the medium even since its earliest days. One of the earliest female artists was Marie Duval, who, together with her husband Charles Henry Ross.Charles Henry Ross. Lambiek. was co-creator and artist of one of the earliest recurring characters in modern cartoons and comics, Ally Sloper. Tove Jansson is best known as a book writer, but she did also write and draw comics featuring her characters, \\"The Moomins\\" in the 1950s, containing the same poetical qualities as her books. In the UK, Posy Simmonds started her career in 1979 with the weekly comic strip The Silent Three of St. Botolph's for The Guardian about the daily life of three former schoolfriends, which lasted for a decade. She had also written children's books, often in comic form, such as Fred (where later a successful animated special) and Lulu and The Flying Babies. For the 1990s and 2000s, she has done more serious works, inspired by literary classics, such as Gemma Bovery and Tamara Drewe. =France/Belgium= An early veteran on the Franco-Belgian market was Liliane FunckenLiliane Funcken. Lambiek. (n√©e Schorils), who, after meeting her husband Fred FunckenFred Funcken. Lambiek. (himself a comics veteran), teamed up with him to embark on a long-lasting career with Tintin magazine from the 1950s up until the 1980s, where the couple collaborated on comics and illustration. They have adopted a realistic style, and mostly specialise in historic works. One of the earliest successful female artists was Claire Bret√©cher, who started her career in the 1960s and is famed for her humor series Les Frustr√©s and the co-creation of the magazine L'√âcho des savanes along with Gotlib and Mandryka. In 1976, the French magazine Ah ! Nana was launched. It was inspired by the feminist underground comix from the US, published by Humano√Ødes Associ√©s and was an attempt to branch out of Metal Hurlant magazine by the same editor with a majority of female artists. It tried to adhere to the rock'n'roll attitude of the former magazine, and sometimes featured male artists from the magazine, such as Jacques Tardi and Moebius. Every issue was built around a theme, such as Nazism or homo- and transsexuality. Issue 7, 1978, about sadomasochism was deemed pornography and was forbidden to sell to minors below 18 years of age, a rule which by extension forbade kiosks to advertise the magazine, thus cutting off many of the magazine's market outlets. In the end, this forced the cancellation of the magazine due to bad sales, through means considered by the authors as censorship of a feminist voice. The last issue was issue 9, themed around incest. No similar comics magazine has since appeared in the Franco-Belgian market, but it helped launch or consolidate the careers of Chantal MontellierChantal Montellier. Lambiek. (gritty, feminist, political sci-fi), Nicole ClavelouxNicole Claveloux. Lambiek. (surreal fantasy) and Florence CestacFlorence Cestac. Lambiek. (funny cartoons). Another author that appeared during this time was Annie Goetzinger,Annie Goetzinger. Lambiek. who worked in a realistic art nouveau style and drew adventures with female protagonists. She frequently collaborated with Pierre Christin, and has won two awards at the Angoul√™me festival. In the beginning of the 21st century, Marjane Satrapi released the critically acclaimed Persepolis about her childhood and coming- of-age in a politically turbulent Iran, and in Europe.

Warren. It stars John Nolan and Carolyn Courage as two cousins who fall victim to a curse that a witch placed on their ancestors. Conceived as a \\"fun horror film\\" with a simple premise, Terror was shot in various locations around London and Surrey. Although it was a box office success in the United Kingdom, it has drawn a mixed critical response for its storytelling and visual style, both of which were inspired by the Italian giallo horror film Suspiria (1977). Warren's plans for a sequel remain unrealised. Plot Three hundred years ago, the witch Mad Dolly is captured on the orders of Lord Garrick. She is about to be burned at the stake when she invokes the Devil, causing one of her executioners to catch fire. Garrick rushes back to his house, where a disembodied arm bursts through a wall and strangles him. Lady Garrick is confronted by a sword-wielding Mad Dolly, who beheads her and curses the family's descendants. Credits roll, revealing that these scenes form the ending of a horror film directed by James Garrick ‚Äì the last of the Garrick line with his cousin Ann. James is hosting a preview screening for Ann, an aspiring actress, and their friends at the largely unchanged Garrick house, which he now owns. He believes his film to be based on true events and has also inherited Mad Dolly's sword. Gary, a mesmerist, hypnotises Ann as a party trick. In her trance, Ann picks up the sword and swings it at James, wounding him slightly. After being overpowered by the other guests, she comes to her senses and leaves the house. When James's friend Carol departs she is stabbed to death in the surrounding woods by an unseen assailant. Ann returns to her hostel in London with bloodstained hands, observed by her roommate Suzy. Other murders and strange deaths follow. At the strip club where Ann and her friends work as waitresses, a patron is ejected by the bouncer after groping Ann; on returning home, he is thrown onto a row of spiked railings and dismembered. At James's film studio, an overhead lamp falls to the floor and crushes Les, a short-tempered director trying to shoot a sex film called Bathtime with Brenda. Viv ‚Äì the title character, and one of Ann's friends ‚Äì is stabbed to death at the hostel. Ann visits James's assistant Philip at the studio and tells him that she has no memory of her attack on James or how she got home on the night that Carol was murdered. After she leaves, Philip is attacked by flying props and equipment and decapitated by a falling sheet of glass. Ann flees the hostel when she finds Suzy being questioned by police about her and Viv. An officer pursues her but is repeatedly run over and crushed by his car, which is being driven by a supernatural force. While making her way to the Garrick house, Ann is caught in unusually strong winds and takes refuge in a parked car, but is forced to jump out when the vehicle inexplicably rises into the air. Reaching the house, she experiences bizarre visions and sees various objects moving of their own accord. She is then startled by the sudden arrival of an unseen figure and strikes him down with an axe, only then to discover that she has killed James. The spirit of Mad Dolly re-appears, cackling, as her sword flies across the room and fatally impales Ann against a wall.

Warren's second collaboration with producers Les and Moira Young and Richard Crafter, with whom he had made Satan's Slave (1976). According to Warren, Terror was conceived as a \\"fun horror film\\" intended solely to entertain. The plot was therefore kept simple, taking the form of a series of murder set pieces. Warren and others pitched ideas for various scenes, from which screenwriter David McGillivray produced a script. Warren has admitted that much of the film \\"doesn't make sense, because many of the people who get killed have nothing to do with the cursed family.\\" Warren and his associates, who had struggled to obtain funding for their earlier films, used the box office revenue from Satan's Slave to finance their new production entirely by themselves. According to Warren, the budget for Terror \\"from script to answer print\\" was approximately ¬£50,000 (approximately ¬£ in ). He has said that being able to make Terror as a \\"truly independent film\\" was advantageous from a creative point of view as they \\"didn't have to show the script to anybody.\\" Various aspects of the film ‚Äì including the plot, lighting, music and sound effects ‚Äì were inspired by Dario Argento's Suspiria (1977). However, Warren has maintained that Terror is not simply a copy of the earlier film: \\"It was just liberating in that you could suddenly get away with doing whatever you liked.\\" While casting the film, Warren and associate producer Moira Young deliberately sought out new actors with no film experience. All the roles were cast in two months. The characters played by Glynis Barber and Elaine Ives-Cameron did not appear in the original script; they were written in because Warren and Young were impressed by the actresses' auditions and were determined to use them. Ives-Cameron based her performance as Dolores Hamilton, the owner of the Theatre Girls' Hostel, on that of Gloria Swanson in the film Sunset Boulevard (1950). =Filming= Terror was produced in four weeks during the summer and was shot in various locations around London and Surrey. Both Warren and producer Les Young have noted that due to the multiple locations, the filming logistics were more complicated than they had been for Satan's Slave. The filming location for the Garrick residence was the house of the Baron and Baroness DeVeuce in Pirbright; this had previously served as the main location for Satan's Slave. Many of the woodland scenes were shot on the surrounding estate. In a 2009 interview, Warren described the house as the \\"perfect location\\" as it was \\"huge and could be used in so many different ways.\\" The opening party scenes were filmed in a single June evening. A nearby lodge served as the focus of an extended scene in which the character Suzy, whose car has broken down on a country lane, takes refuge inside a seemingly empty cottage where she is terrorised by a dark figure who turns out to be a friendly mechanic. Warren has admitted that this sequence \\"doesn't make sense\\", describing it as a \\"10-minute red herring\\". Scenes set at the Theatre Girls' Hostel were filmed at a nurses' hostel in Holland Park, while a club in Richmond supplied the location for the club where Ann works. James's office at Garrick Studios was represented by the actual office of production company Crystal Film Productions, based in Harlesden. Scenes set on the studio floor were filmed over two days using the interior of Acorn Studios in Barnes. Other filming locations included a street in Victoria, Wood Lane in Shepherd's Bush, Queensway in Bayswater, Barnes railway station and Barnes Common. Many of the outdoor scenes were shot night-for-night; this proved challenging as the decision to film in the summer limited the hours of darkness in which the crew could shoot. The character Philip (played by James Aubrey) was a replacement for Gary, whose actor, Michael Craze, was forced to leave the production after suffering an epileptic seizure on set. Nine defective prints of the film Saturday Night Fever (1977), obtained from The Rank Organisation, were used to create the mass of film stock that attacks Philip before he is killed. Some of the background actors featured in the opening film-within-a-film sequence were employees of BBC Radio London, where McGillivray was working at the time. Other small parts were played by members of the crew; for example, McGillivray appears in one scene as a TV news reporter. =Post-production= The music was produced as a series of sound patterns by Ivor Slaney, who had previously scored Satan's Slave. Warren then matched these patterns to various scenes to create the soundtrack. Warren also oversaw the sound effects, some of which he produced himself by recording his own voice backwards. The end credits include a joke entry naming the actress who plays Mad Dolly as \\"L.E. Mack\\". This character was in fact played by Patti Love. Release and reception Terror was a commercial success in the UK, where it spent a week as box office number one. The scene of Viv's murder was cut prior to the film's release to remove shots of a knife going through the character's feet. =Critical response= Reviewing the film at the time of its release, Tom Milne of The Monthly Film Bulletin described Terror as a \\"curious mixture\\", praising the film's \\"bright dialogue\\", \\"excellent camerawork\\" and \\"Hitchcockian\\" moments of suspense but criticising its \\"statutory\\" plot and use of violent close-ups: \\"Crude and unconvincing, disrupting the atmosphere otherwise so carefully built up, these shots turn the film into something cheap and nasty.\\" Critical response has remained mixed. Jo Botting of the British Film Institute's website Screenonline is complimentary: \\"The effects work extremely well for a low-budget film and, where they are less skilful, expert camerawork and judicious editing hide many of their shortcomings.\\" She argues that the use of violent and sexually explicit imagery makes Terror stylistically similar to European exploitation films. Radio Times critic Alan Jones, who has an uncredited role in the film and gives it two stars out of five, sums up Terror as \\"efficient if rather nonsensical\\" and a \\"cheap British riposte\\" to Suspiria but also names it \\"one of the last great British horror independents\\". Time Out magazine calls the film \\"stock schlock\\" partly redeemed by its dialogue and camerawork, also comparing it to The Exorcist (1973). By contrast, the website TV Cream calls it a \\"rubbish Suspiria knock-off\\", adding: \\"Unless you love badly-acted, no- budget, plotless haunted house gorefests with no style, humour or any redeeming features whatsoever, we say don't bother.\\" The website AllMovie rates Terror one star out of five. According to reviewer Dan Pavlides, the film \\"ultimately fails to live up to its title.\\" Fellow reviewer Fred Beldin regards Terror as \\"one of [Warren's] more watchable films ... trotting out a laundry list of haunted house/slasher/witchcraft clich√©s delivered with crisp British flair and enough gore overkill to satisfy the bloodthirsty.\\" He criticises the film's \\"half-hearted whodunit\\" theme but commends the murder scenes, calling them \\"cheap but nastily effective\\". Ian Jane of DVD Talk suggests that Terror \\"works well if you approach it expecting nothing more than a fun ninety minutes of trashy horror ... there's enough carnage and slickly shot mayhem in here to ensure that even if the characters are rather shallow and the premise a little hokey, the film is never dull.\\" Paul Mavis, reviewing the film for the same website, views Terror as an awkward mixture of \\"Hammer Gothic\\" and \\"New Wave\\" elements, concluding that the film \\"comes out neither particularly good Hammer, nor completely urban, cold, nasty giallo\\". Bill Gibron, also of DVD Talk, opines that there are \\"elements that keep dragging the film down, making it play out longer and more languid than it should,\\" arguing that the story is complicated by a number of plot holes. Ian Fryer, author of The British Horror Film: From the Silent to the Multiplex, regards the decision to set much of the action in a film studio as significant since it allowed Warren and McGillivray \\"some fun at the expense of the sex and horror exploitation film sector both were more than familiar with.\\" Harvey Fenton, editor of Flesh and Blood magazine, comments that the film contains \\"moments ... which almost seem to be homages to the world of exploitation movie production in general\\", comparing the tension between the characters during the Bathtime with Brenda scenes to Warren's memories of making his first feature film, Her Private Hell (1968). Steve Green, also writing for Flesh and Blood, states that one of Terrors enduring aspects is the \\"joy [McGillivray's] script takes in spoofing the [film] industry itself.\\" =Comparison to other films= Ian Cooper, author of Frightmares: A History of British Horror Cinema, considers Terror to be Warren's best film but also his most derivative, noting the influence of Suspiria. He adds that Warren replaces Argento's \\"Gothic fairytale setting\\" of southern Germany with the \\"much less romantic\\" English district of Barnes in London. Comparing Terror to Argento's work, Adam Locks observes that both Warren and Argento favour the \\"spectacle of violence and death\\" over narrative coherence. In Terror, the latter is undermined by the editing of scenes such as Ann's arrival at a railway station and her subsequent walk through a park: according to Locks, the sudden jump from one location to the other causes the narrative to \\"proceed quickly and disjointedly, as in a dream\\" ‚Äì an effect that he calls a \\"classic Argento moment\\". Kim Newman argues that while the film contains a number of \\"Argentoisms\\", such as the bizarre death of Philip, other scenes, like the false stalking of Suzy by the mechanic, are merely \\"hoary clich√©s\\". Nigel Burrell of Flesh and Blood regards the sequence with the mechanic as one of the film's low points, calling it \\"protracted and silly\\". Fenton argues that influence from other films is also evident, believing the woodland chase leading up to Carol's murder to be inspired by The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974). He compares Philip's decapitation to a similar scene in Argento's later film Inferno, suggesting that this was a case of Argento being inspired by Warren. Home video Terror was released on DVD in 2004 by Anchor Bay Entertainment as part of the \\"Norman Warren Collection\\" DVD box set, which also includes Satan's Slave, Prey and Inseminoid. Terror was also released as a double feature DVD by BCI Home Video, paired with Land of the Minotaur, in 2006.https://www.amazon.com/Crypt-Terror-Minotaur-Double- Feature/dp/B000H5U698/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords;=land+of+the+minotaur&qid;=1590364795&sr;=8-1 Unmade sequel Warren has said that since the release of Bloody New Year in 1987 he has been planning a \\"sort of sequel to Terror: a fast-moving film that, along with the horror, also involves music and dancers.\\" The proposed title is \\"Beyond Terror\\". Although Warren has written a script for the film, attempts to secure funding have failed and it remains unmade.

He is a fellow of the Institute of Physics (IOP), a fellow of the American Physical Society (APS), and a fellow of IEEE. He is the Reilly Director of the Center for Predictive Materials and Devices (c-PRIMED), the Director of nanoHUB, the Network for Computational Nanotechnology at Purdue University, and a Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering. He guides the technical developments and strategies of nanoHUB.org which annually serves over 1.5 million users worldwide with online simulations, tutorials, and seminars. Education Klimeck received his Ph.D. in 1994 from Purdue University where he studied electron transport through quantum dots, resonant tunneling diodes and 2-D electron gases. His German electrical engineering degree (Dipl.-Ing.) in 1990 from Ruhr University Bochum was concerned with the study of laser noise propagation. Career Klimeck's research interest is in the modeling of nanoelectronic devices, parallel cluster computing, genetic algorithms, and parallel image processing. He has been driving the development of the Nanoelectronic Modeling Tool NEMO since 1994. Klimeck was the Technical Group Supervisor of the High Performance Computing Group and a Principal Scientist at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology. Previously, he was a member of technical staff at the Central Research Lab of Texas Instruments where he served as manager and principal architect of the Nanoelectronic Modeling (NEMO 1-D) program. At JPL and Purdue, Klimeck developed the Nanoelectronic Modeling Tool (NEMO 3-D) for multi-million atom simulations. NEMO 1-D was the first quantitative simulation tool for resonant tunneling diodes and 1D heterostructures. NEMO 3-D was the first multi-million atom electronic structure code and has been used to quantitatively model optical properties of self-assembled quantum dots, disordered Si/SiGe systems, and single impurities in silicon. NEMO is based on the representation of the nanoelectronic device with atomistic empirical tight-binding. Quantitative device modeling was demonstrated without any material parameter adjustments, just by entry of geometrical structure parameters. At Purdue his group is developing a new simulation engine that combines the NEMO 1-D and NEMO 3-D capabilities into new codes entitled OMEN and NEMO5. NEMO 1-D was demonstrated to scale up to 23,000 parallel processors, NEMO 3-D was demonstrated to scale to 8,192 processors, and OMEN was demonstrated to scale to 222,720 processors. =Patents= *U.S. 6490193: Forming and storing data in a memory cell *U.S. 6667490: Method and system for generating a memory cell *U.S. Patent 2012/0043,607: Tunneling Field-Effect Transistor with Low Leakage Current =Books= *Computational Electronics: Semiclassical and Quantum Device Modeling and Simulation (2010) CRC Press, Book: Computational Electronics at Amazon.com =Honors/Awards= *Klimeck won 9 NASA Tech Briefs from 2004‚Äì2007,Awards and Honors: Klimeck, Gerhard various NASA Software and Space Awards and Dr. Edward Stone Award for Outstanding Research Publication 2002Short Biography of Klimeck, Gerhard *08/2005 Human- Competitive awards in genetic and evolutionary programming‚Äì the ‚ÄúHUMIES‚Äù, $1,000 shared with Richard J.

The game was released in January 2012 for Microsoft Windows via Steam, and Mac OS X through Steam in May 2012. A Linux port was released as part of the Humble Indie Bundle 6. Capcom published the game for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, and Xbox 360. Within the game, the player controls one of four janitors who are attempting to sweep away a world corrupted with dust and filth. The player uses a number of acrobatic skills, such as double jumping and wall jumping to progress through the game's fifty-some levels, cleaning sections covered by leaves and attacking filth-covered creatures to score and progress through the level. The player's performance is ranked based on time and completion, and access to certain levels requires near-perfect runs of earlier levels. Gameplay Dustforce is a platform game that has been compared to games such as Super Meat Boy and N+, where fast-response timed actions are considered necessary to complete the game. It is set in a world where filth has corrupted the creatures that live in the area; the four-member Dustforce team of janitors aims to clean up the mess and restore the world. An overworld provides access to more than fifty levels, though about half are initially locked to the player. The player controls an agile sweeper as they clear away leaves and defeat creatures across the landscape. After the player selects a level, they pick one of the four Dustforce members, who all share the same moves but have slightly different statistics, such as jumping height. Within the level, the player must maneuver their character to the end goal using acrobatic tricks such as double jumps, wall jumps, mid-air dashes, and clinging to the ceiling. Along the way, the character will automatically sweep up any debris on the walls or floors. The player can also initiate regular and super-attacks against filth-covered creatures to restore them to normal. The end goal of a level typically requires reaching a final area and defeating foes waiting there. Should the character run into any hazards such as pits or spikes on the level, the player will have to resume the run from a previous checkpoint. Upon completing a level, the player is ranked based on \\"finesse\\" and completion. Finesse is determined by the combo meter, which is reset if the player takes a hit or proceeds too slowly, and completion is determined by the amount of debris and enemies cleaned. The ratings, evaluated separately, are based on a letter-grade scale, with \\"D\\" through \\"A\\" reflecting increasingly better performances, and an \\"S\\" grade, representing a perfect combo, or full completion. Completing a level with an \\"S\\" grade in both finesse and completion provides the player with one of three colored keys to unlock certain levels in the overworld. The player is also rated on a scoring system and ranked on a global leaderboard. The player scores a fixed number of points for every patch of filth that is cleaned up multiplied by their current combo meter, and increases their current combo meter by 1. The combo meter only stays active for a short period of time, but resets for each patch cleaned up; thus by hitting many patches in a row quickly, the player can build up the combo multiplier and drastically increase their score. Player replays are stored online with the leaderboards, allowing other players to review how top scorers were able to complete various levels. The PlayStation 3 version will include the ability to save and share level replays to YouTube, while this, the Vita, and Xbox 360 version will include the ability to save replays locally. Dustforce includes a four-player local multiplayer mode including variants such as Survival and King of the Hill modes, where players scale the level and fight against other players towards victory. Players can act as the janitors, cleaning up filth, while the other players lay down filth on clean patches of the level. A level editor for both single player and multiplayer maps was released as part of a patch for the Windows version of the game and the debut of the Mac OS X version. Levels are shared through a website created by Hitbox Team. The PlayStation and Xbox versions includes 150 user-generated level as voted on by players. Development The Dustforce team race through this gameplay trailer sweeping up the filth from the world. Designer Woodley Nye came up with the idea one day while sweeping a pile of leaves. The team was working on another game at the time but switched to Dustforce when they heard about the Indiepub contest. In designing the game Nye wanted to create an acrobatic 2D platformer. He credits the games N and Nikujin as inspirations for the project. Hitbox has also stated that the game Super Smash Bros. Melee was an influence to the team citing its easy pick up and play approach while still maintaining a level of depth for experienced players. In selecting the art style Nye opted for a simplistic style that would showcase the various frames of animation. He has cited Dragon Ball Z as an influence in terms of design aesthetic stating that \\"they have great poses and also good shapes\\". Dustforce won the $100,000 Grand Prize at indiePub Games' Third Independent Game Developers Competition at the 2010 Game Developers Conference Online. The money was used by the four-person Hitbox team to develop the game over about one and a half years. After about a year of its successful release on Microsoft Windows, Capcom talked to Hitbox about porting the title to consoles. Capcom used their localization team, QLoc, to support the transition to console and managing features like leaderboards and replay saving. The console version will include 150 user-created levels from the Windows version as voted on by players. On 10 January 2012, the developers announced in a blog post that the game would be released in a week's time, on 17 January 2012. The blog post, which also contained a gameplay trailer (right), surprised the gaming media. = DX Update = On October 23, 2014, Hitbox announced on their website that a free update to Dustforce, Dustforce DX, was available to all owners of the base game. The DX update added 109 community maps accessible through an in-game console, a new music track by Lifeformed, and support for Steam trading cards. The update also included changes designed to make the game friendlier to newer players. The single tutorial was broken into 3 separate maps, 16 easier levels were added, and the 4 world hubs were consolidated into a single area. The overworld redesign makes it more difficult to reach the harder levels. According to Hitbox developer Woodley Nye, the redesign ‚Äúhelps in two ways: it keeps new players away from levels they aren't ready for yet, and it serves as a teaching tool for more advanced techniques that are required in the tougher levels.‚Äù Reception Dustforce was generally well received by critics, praised for its demanding gameplay, online leaderboard features, graphics, and soundtrack. Kyle Orland of Ars Technica, was pleased with the difficulty of the game even after facing levels he could not complete, and considered Dustforce as \\"a game that's not content to let you be content with yourself, and for that it's definitely worth playing\\". Marsh Davies of Eurogamer considered that once a player can work their way through a level with perfect completion, \\"it's hard not to admire the pat precision of the controls or deny the transcendent joy of a high-ranking run\\". The use of reviewing online replays was highly praised to help players that were stumbling with the game. IGN's Anthony Gallegos considered the replays to be not only \\"awesome and humbling\\" to review, but also aiding in teaching the player of new techniques. Several noted that Dustforce is the type of game that a player may get frustrated with quickly after replaying levels over and over to get the \\"S\\" grades, but this emotion is calmed by the game's graphics and music. PC Gamers Lucas Sullivan considered that the combination of the \\"soothing, ethereal background music\\" and \\"fluid animations and beautifully stylized character designs\\" provided a zen-like meditative setting for the player to practice within. Nathan Grayson of GameSpy considered that \\"the whole audio-visual package colludes to create a strikingly powerful soothing effect\\" that contrasts the tight demands of the gameplay. Some reviewers noted that the game fails to fully explain some of its features through the simplistic menus. There is no immediate information about the differences between the characters when selecting one prior to a level, and the multiplayer mode is not well explained. Others noted that the multiplayer mode felt like an add-on, and without online connectivity, would likely not be a feature many gamers would play. Although the game defaults to the use of keyboard controls, several found these to be a hindrance and switched to a gamepad, which had to be configured manually. Some reviewers also noted that the game has some performance issues based on its initial release. Sales of the game were boosted by both being featured in a mid-week Steam promotion in May 2012, its inclusion in the Humble Bundle, and further discounts during 2012 holiday season sales. Hitbox states that the team directly earned US$ 489,000 after one year of sales, which will be used to fund development of their next game, Spire.

It is named after Sgt. Joshua Eaton, the only Reading casualty in the American Revolutionary War. The school is located at the corner of Summer Avenue and Oak Street, close to the site of Joshua Eaton's family home. In 1944, Dr. William K. Wilson, supervisor of educational planning of school buildings for the New York State Education Department, was hired to study the Reading school system. One of his observations was that an elementary school was needed in the area of Prescott Street, Main Street and the railroad tracks. His recommendation was that the school should plan to accommodate 500 children from kindergarten through grade six. When Joshua Eaton opened in 1949, it housed grades 1‚Äì6. Today, it houses around 450 children in kindergarten through fifth grade. The building was designed by reading architect George Sidebottom. The original building consisted of 18 classrooms, an auditorium, cafeteria and gymnasium. At that time, the school was chosen as the best-designed elementary school building in the nation (38,000 blueprints were submitted). Joshua Eaton was dedicated on Sunday, October 23, 1949.

ISSN 1368-485X Design and development The aircraft was designed as a US FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles rules two-seat trainer. It features a cable-braced hang glider-style high-wing, weight-shift controls, a two-seats-in-tandem open cockpit, tricycle landing gear and a single engine in pusher configuration. The aircraft is made from bolted-together aluminum tubing, with its single surface wing covered in Dacron sailcloth. Its span wing is supported by a single tube-type kingpost and uses an \\"A\\" frame control bar. Unlike the Spartan DFS Trike the Aerotome uses only a trike delta wing and cannot be converted for powered parachute use. The standard engine supplied was the twin cylinder, two-stroke, air-cooled Rotax 503, with a fuel tank. When in production it came with optional dual controls, aero-towing hardware, larger engines and fuel tank. Thirty had been completed and flown by February 2000.

City of Oakland (or the Riders Case or Riders Scandal) was a civil rights lawsuit in Federal District Court regarding police misconduct in Oakland, California which has resulted in ongoing Federal oversight.Judge slams Oakland leaders in police sex scandal Plaintiffs alleged mistreatment at the hands of four veteran officers, known as the \\"Riders\\", who were alleged to have kidnapped, planted evidence, and beaten citizens. Plaintiffs also alleged that the Oakland Police Department (OPD) turned a blind eye to police misconduct. The plaintiffs were represented by the Law Offices of John Burris and the Law Offices of James B. Chanin. Ms. Julie Houk, Mr. Chanin's associate, also played a major role in the litigation that has lasted for nearly fourteen years. In 2003, the parties entered into a settlement. Part of that settlement saw a $10.9 million payout to the 119 plaintiffs. Additionally, the Oakland Police Department was required to comply with a series of reforms. An independent monitoring team was appointed by the court to ensure the police complied with the settlement. As of January 15, 2019, the city has yet to fully comply with the terms of that settlement.24 January 2012 ruling Background \\"The Riders\\" refer to four officers in the Oakland Police Department. The Washington Post described them: > At the high point of their careers, the so-called \\"Riders\\" were considered > the best and the brightest, veterans whom rookie police officers tried to > emulate. Their specialty: bringing in reputed drug dealers in record numbers > from the crime-plagued streets of West Oakland.Liz Garone, \\"Oakland's Police > 'Riders' on Trial: Officers Lauded for Drug Busts Are Accused of Brutality > by Ex-Colleague,\\" Washington Post, January 26, 2003 The alleged abuses came to light after a rookie officer, just 10 days on the job and fresh out of the police academy, resigned and reported his former co- workers' activities to the police department's Internal Affairs Division. A string of incidents of police misconduct by the group of four Oakland PD officers known as \\"the Oakland Riders\\" came to light. 119 people pressed civil rights lawsuits for unlawful beatings and detention, ultimately settling for $11 million with an agreement that the Oakland Police Department would implement significant reforms. Although all of the police officers involved were fired, three were later acquitted of criminal charges while one fled, presumably to Mexico, to avoid prosecution. Lawsuit On 17 December 2000, Delphine Allen filed suit against the city. His case was ultimately consolidated along with other similar civil rights lawsuits against Oakland and its police, including a total of 119 different plaintiffs. In 2003, the city entered into a negotiated settlement agreement. As part of the settlement, the city agreed to pay nearly $11 million to the 119 plaintiffs.  Negotiated settlement The parties negotiated the largest legal settlement in Oakland municipal history and on March 14, 2003, the district court approved the negotiated settlement agreement.Janine DeFao, \\"Oakland settles 'Riders' Suits: Record $10.5 Million Payout,\\" San Francisco Chronicle, February 19, 2003 The settlement brought major changes to police department operations and dealings with the public. The case riveted the city as it was the largest case of police misconduct in Oakland in decades. Despite the settlement's hefty price tag, Russo said the cases could have cost the city tens of millions of dollars more had they gone to trial, pointing out that the victims had spent more than 25 years, combined, imprisoned on false charges. By comparison, Los Angeles spent $40 million to settle litigation stemming from the Rampart corruption scandal. The payout went to 119 plaintiffs who filed federal civil rights lawsuits claiming four police officers kidnapped, beat and planted drugs on them during the summer of 2000. The plaintiffs alleged that the Oakland Police Department either encouraged or turned a blind eye to the abuse. U.S. District Court Judge Thelton Henderson approved the settlement in the civil cases after 18 months of negotiations. Post- settlement action On August 20, 2003, the District Court appointed an independent monitoring team; Rachel Burgess, Kelli Evans, Charles Gruber and Christy Lopez to oversee the reform process and ensure city compliance with the settlement agreement. In January 2010, a monitoring team led by Robert Warshaw was appointed to replace the team that was appointed in August 2003.Robert S.

Reporters from the East Bay Express reported that Robert Warshaw forced Whent to resign due to the role of Whent (and his wife) in the coverup of a sexual-misconduct scandal involving Oakland police officers (as well as personnel from multiple other agencies) and a minor girl. The reporters also suspect that Whent was motivated by a desire to prevent another scandal from preventing the termination of federal oversight of the department.

Army cooperation planes combined the roles of artillery spotter aircraft, liaison, reconnaissance plane and close air support. Details The concept of army cooperation units was invented in France at the end of World War I. Numerous countries experimented with the idea of creating separate units tasked with close cooperation with ground units. However, in most cases the roles of observation, reconnaissance and liaison were kept separate, with each assigned to a more specialised unit. One of the few countries to actually implement the idea was Poland. By the end of the 1930s the Polish Army had 12 escadrilles of \\"assisting aircraft\\", usually operating as platoons of 3 to 6 aircraft attached to regiments of infantry or cavalry. Typical Polish army cooperation planes included Lublin R-XIII, PZL ≈Å.2 and RWD-14 Czapla. According to Polish specifications of the late 1920s, the army cooperation aircraft were capable of STOL, had folding wings and relatively small dimensions to allow them to operate from improvised airfields and improvised hangars such as barns. The folding wings also allowed for the plane to be towed by a car or truck, which was essential for the planes to operate in cooperation with the land units.

He has previously played in MLB for the Philadelphia Phillies, Texas Rangers, Arizona Diamondbacks, and Kansas City Royals. With the Phillies, Diekman began as a starting pitcher and progressed through a few levels of the Phillies' farm system in his first two years in that role, before adjusting his mechanics and lowering his arm slot to throw sidearm out of the bullpen, as a relief pitcher. The adjustment worked and helped him move through the remaining levels of the Phillies' farm system. In 2012, Diekman made his major league debut. Over the next two seasons, he split time between the major league Phillies and their Triple-A (AAA) affiliate, the Lehigh Valley IronPigs, though while he was with the major league team, he was considered one of the \\"lone bright spots\\" in both 2012 and . Diekman throws a fastball in the upper-90s (mph), a slider, and an occasional changeup; his fastball is among the fastest of any left-handed reliever in the major leagues. Early career Diekman was born to Paul and Billie Diekman, in 1987. He has one brother, Brian. The Diekmans lived in Wymore, Nebraska, where Jake attended Southern High School. His alma mater was too small to field a baseball team, so he instead focused on golf. Eventually, Diekman joined an American Legion baseball team, playing in the summer with other players from Wymore and several surrounding towns, which he called \\"the best experience of my life ... so much fun.\\" Concurrently, Diekman worked full-time at a lawn mower factory, to earn money to pursue a post-secondary education. After graduating from high school, Diekman enrolled at Doane College, pitching one season for the school's ball team. He then transferred to Cloud County Community College, in Kansas. Following Diekman's sophomore season, he attended a junior college baseball showcase at which, with a fastball well over , Diekman drew much interest. He received an offer for a full scholarship to be a Nebraska Cornhusker, which he would have accepted, had the Phillies not drafted him in the 2007 Major League Baseball Draft's 30th round. Professional career =Philadelphia Phillies= Diekman follows through after throwing a pitch in a game on September 7, 2013 Between 2007 and 2010, he pitched in the lower levels of the Philadelphia Phillies' Minor League system initially as a starter, and subsequently as a reliever. Although he initially saw success in 2007, posting a 2.72 ERA in 10 starts with GCL Phillies and Williamsport Crosscutters, he struggled in 2008, posting an ERA of 5.09 in 27 starts, split between Williamsport and the Lakewood BlueClaws. At the conclusion of both 2008 and 2009, he pitched in the Florida Instructional League to continue honing his skills on the mound. He converted from a starting pitcher to a reliever in 2009, along with several other Phillies pitching prospects. Around that time, he also, at the suggestion of the same minor league pitching coaches who converted him to relief, lowered his release point to his current low angle. Success did not manifest itself immediately, as he still posted a 4.04 ERA in 2009, his first season in relief, but in 2010, he cut his ERA to 2.91 while splitting time between Lakewood and the Clearwater Threshers, the Phillies High-A affiliate. At the end of the 2010 season, he played for the Mesa Solar Sox in the Arizona Fall League. He spent the 2011 season with the Double-A Reading Phillies, accruing a 0‚Äì1 record and a 3.05 ERA and 3 saves in 53 games. Thereafter, the Phillies added him to their 40-man roster to protect him from the Rule 5 draft. After receiving praise from Phillies' pitching coach Rich Dubee for his performance in spring training, Diekman opened the 2012 season with the Triple-A (AAA) Lehigh Valley IronPigs. With Lehigh Valley, he posted a 1‚Äì0 record and a 0.59 ERA with 5 saves in 13 games in the season's first month. He was added to the Phillies' 25-man Major League roster on May 11, and four days later recorded a win against the Houston Astros in his MLB debut. He finished the year an established lefty specialist, and had a 3.95 ERA, though walked 6.6 batters per 9 innings, and was erratic in his control. Entering 2013, Diekman was expected to be a key part of the Phillies bullpen after his success in 2012, however he did not break camp with the big league club, beginning the season in AAA. In AAA, he struggled, which delayed his arrival to the major league team until June. While with the big league club, he continued his dominance of left-handed hitters, however was not as good against right-handed hitters (a 150-point differential in opponent batting average and over 300 point differential in On-base plus slugging (OPS)). Diekman improved his control, which made him a presumptive member of the 2014 bullpen, as he was one of 2013's \\"lone bright spots\\" for the otherwise dismal Phillies' bullpen. Ultimately, he did make the Phillies' opening day roster as a member of the bullpen. Early in the season, Diekman emerged as a reliable reliever in the Phillies' bullpen, and was used extensively by manager Ryne Sandberg. As the season progressed, Diekman was more successful against left-handed hitters than right-handed hitters, but was used against both in a variety of situations. On September 1, 2014, Diekman was one of four pitchers who combined for a no-hitter in the Phillies' 7-0 win over the Atlanta Braves in Turner Field. By the end of the season, the Phillies had one of the best bullpens in the league, and it consisted predominantly of young players such as Diekman. There was excitement from both Phillies' personnel and writers that the bullpen could remain solid for a long time because of young pitchers such as Diekman, Ken Giles, and Justin De Fratus. Moreover, Diekman and Giles had potential as closers should the Phillies trade Jonathan Papelbon. Overall, Diekman emerged as a name to be mentioned among the \\"elite\\" relievers of the National League, but was overused against right-handed batters, which hurt his statistics. =Texas Rangers= On July 31, 2015, Diekman was traded to the Texas Rangers along with Cole Hamels in exchange for Matt Harrison, Nick Williams, Jorge Alfaro, Jake Thompson, Alec Asher, and Jerad Eickhoff. He became an important bullpen piece in the Rangers' run to the playoffs in 2016. Diekman and the Rangers agreed to a one-year deal worth $1.225 million on January 29, 2016, and avoided arbitration. Diekman finished the 2016 season with a 4-2 record, 4 saves and a 3.40 ERA in 66 appearances. On January 25, 2017, Diekman underwent surgery for chronic ulcerative colitis. He only made 11 appearances towards the end of the season. In 2018, fully healthy, Diekman posted an ERA of 3.69 in 47 games. He struck out 48 batters in 39 innings. =Arizona Diamondbacks= On July 31, 2018, Diekman was traded to the Arizona Diamondbacks for Wei-Chieh Huang and Joshua Javier. The trade took place while the Diamondbacks and Rangers were facing off in a two-game series in Arizona. Diekman struggled after being acquired by Arizona, posting an ERA of 7.53 in 24 appearances. Diekman became a free agent following the 2018 season. =Kansas City Royals= On February 13, 2019, Diekman signed a one-year contract with a mutual option for 2020 with the Kansas City Royals. The deal is worth a reported $2.75 million guaranteed, plus performance incentives. =Oakland Athletics= On July 27, 2019, the Royals traded Diekman to the Oakland Athletics for Ismael Aquino and Dairon Blanco. On September 6, Diekman pitched in a suspended game between the Athletics and Detroit Tigers that originally started on May 19, allowing a double in a scoreless inning. This appearance would be recorded to have occurred on May 19, when Diekman threw an inning of relief for the Royals against the Los Angeles Angels. Diekman thus holds the rare feat of having pitched for two different teams on the same day. In 2019 he tied for the major league lead in holds (31). In 28 games for the A's, Diekman struck out 21 in innings. Diekman became a free agent following the 2019 season after the Athletics declined his contract option. On December 3, 2019, Diekman re-signed with Oakland on a two-year contract. Pitching style A lefty specialist, Diekman throws a fastball in the mid-90s, a slider at 78-81, and an occasional changeup to right-handed hitters. His fastball is among the fastest of left- handed relievers in the major leagues. Like most left-handed pitchers, particularly those who throw out of an arm angle similar to Diekman's, he is tough on left-handed hitters. In 2013, he held lefties to just a .368 OPS, though allowed a .765 OPS to right-handed hitters. Despite suggestions he remain a lefty specialist, he emerged in 2014 as a favorite middle reliever for manager Ryne Sandberg against both righties and lefties. In 2020, Diekman credited Rob Friedman (baseball analyst) with helping improve his slider grip through Twitter, increasing the horizontal break on his slider substantially. Personal life Diekman's mother died at age 57 just months before the Phillies drafted him. Diekman describes his father as his \\"best friend\\", and one who has helped him cope with his mother's death. His mother, Billie, was Diekman's \\"biggest fan\\" and had to order her husband, Paul, to stop pacing and watch Diekman pitch. Diekman has sought therapy to cope with the loss of his mother, and meditates and thinks about her during \\"The Star Spangled Banner\\" prior to each game. Away from baseball, Diekman holds an associate's degree in business administration from Cloud County Community College. He enjoys listening to music, working out, and playing golf. He resides in Beatrice, Nebraska, during the offseason. Because of his struggles with ulcerative colitis, he started a non-profit association called Gut It Out to benefit others who struggle with the disease.

History  Bronze sculpture Old Town Hall As early as 1312 a half-timbered Town Hall (German: Altes Rathaus) had been built on the market square in Halle (Saale) on the Saale River, east-central Germany. In 1466 a stone building was constructed. Later on the Town Hall was subject to several transformations. The architect Nickel Hoffmann added Renaissance features to the Gothic architecture style building. The south wing of the Town Hall, dating from the 16th century, was substituted by the Baroque wing in 1702, decorated by a grand entrance portal. On 31 March 1945 an air raid damaged parts of Halle (Saale)‚Äôs Old Town Hall and of the Old Weighing House (German: Alte Waage or Ratswaage). These buildings with their variety of architectural styles were demolished. The site of the Old Town Hall is now an unbuilt area with the foundation walls beneath. chocolate Town Hall, 2010 Since 2001 a free-standing bronze sculpture of the Old Town Hall, created by Cathleen Meier, has commemorated this building. This piece of art, financed entirely by donations, is situated on the former location of the Baroque wing in front of the City Council Building (German: Ratshof) which used to be the Old Town Hall‚Äôs rear building. In 2006 the triptych ‚ÄúThe Council‚Äôs Loggia‚Äù (German: Ratsloggia) produced by Maya Graber and funded publicly, was unveiled at the historic site of this loggia.

It premiered on E4 in the UK on 30 January 2012. The episode is told from the point of view of character Rich Hardbeck.http://www.e4.com/blog/skins- news/posts/1-10/view.e4http://www.e4.com/skins/series6/profiles/rich.html Professor David Blood has banned Rich from visiting Grace in hospital and Rich is suffering. Alo tries to keep him out of trouble with a band practice, but Rich is committed to his love and he stands outside the hospital waiting for Grace's call. Eventually the call comes and Rich finds a way past security and breaks into Grace's room. The lovers are reunited, but they have a problem as Blood is moving Grace to another hospital in Zurich. Rich goes to Grace's house to appeal to Professor Blood, but finds they've already gone. Rich moves into the house, sleeping in Grace's room until Alo tracks him down and pledges to help his best mate, but Alo has other things on his mind and cracks begin to develop in the boys' friendship. It falls to Liv to bring the fractured group back together again.http://www.channel4.com/programmes/skins/4od#3300693 Plot Rich has been desperately waiting for Grace, who is in a coma after the car crash in the previous episode, to wake up, having been barred from visiting her by her father, David Blood. Despite the best efforts of Alo and his friend O'Malley to get Rich involved in a band, Grace's condition occupies Rich's mind permanently, and even causes him to alienate his parents. Eventually, though, he receives a phone call from Grace, and rushes to the hospital to come and see her. After managing to sneak in through a vent, the two begin to kiss, but Blood walks in and has Rich escorted from the premises, revealing that he is taking Grace to Switzerland, ostensibly to keep her away from Rich. Rich is upset and, the next day, goes to Blood's house to try and reason with him to let Grace stay, only to find that the Bloods have already left. Devastated, he breaks into their house, and discovers an old collection of film reels, which turn out to be Grace's baby videos, and he occupies his time watching them. Days later, Alo comes knocking, having worked out that Rich is staying in the house, and offers support. They squat there with a bag of weed and begin trashing the house. However, Rich continues to be occupied by his pain at not seeing Grace, which is made even worse when Mini turns up at the house to have sex with Alo. Rich attempts to call the hospital in Switzerland, but Blood picks up the phone and tells Rich off. Nonetheless, he receives another call from Grace, and tells her to meet him in Paris. Rich's temper reaches boiling point when Alo moves the band stuff into the house, and in his rage, he begins to destroy the instruments. He then has an argument with Alo over his having sex with Mini, and when he makes a harsh comment, their argument becomes a fistfight. Depressed, Rich contacts Liv, who is shocked to discover that Grace had awoken from her coma and nobody had bothered to call her. She in turn informs Franky, and the three resolve to go to Paris to find Grace (since Franky is fluent in French). Alo reveals that he has arranged a band gig at the Bloods' house, and that if they charge a ¬£5 entrance fee, they can get to Paris in Alo's van. During the gig, however, Rich begins to see Grace in the crowd, and runs after her. He makes it up to her room, and finds her in bed. Relieved, the two begin to have sex. Then next morning, however, Rich wakes up in an empty bed, finding the house wrecked and empty. He hears his phone ringing outside, picks it up and answers a call from Grace, who cryptically tells him that she has to go, and comments that \\"it's so beautiful, out here.\\" When the call ends, Rich looks at the phone to find that it is broken. He returns inside, where Blood has returned home. Rich learns that Grace had not even come out of her coma ‚Äî meaning that his visions of her and the phonecalls were just hallucinations. Blood acknowledges the damage that has been done to his house but is unfazed by it, and, through tears, informs Rich that Grace has died.http://www.denofgeek.com/television/1226325/skins_series_6_episode_2_rich_review.html References Category:Skins (British TV series) episodes Category:2012 British television episodes ","title":"Rich (Skins series 6)"},{"id":"34549708","text":"Irina Borechko (born 13 January 1972) is a Kazakhstani handball player.

Biography  Portrait of Mariano Rivera Paz Mariano Rivera Paz was born in Guatemala City and studied law in the Royal and Pontifical University of San Carlos Borromeo.  Conflagration between Liberals and Conservatives  In 1838 the liberal forces of Morazan and Jos√© Francisco Barrundia invaded Guatemala and reached San Sur, where they executed Ch√∫a Alvarez, father-in-law of the Guatemalan military leader Rafael Carrera and laid his head on a pike to teach a lesson to all followers of the Guatemalan caudillo. Upon learnings this, Carrera and his wife Petrona - had come to confront Moraz√°n as soon as they learned of the invasion and were in Mataquescuintla- swore they would never forgive Morazan even in his grave, as they felt that no one could respect someone who could not avenge family members. After sending several envoys, who Carrera would not receive -especially Barrundia who was not received because Carrera did not want to murder him in cold blood- Moraz√°n began a strong scorched earth offensive, destroying villages in his path and stripping them of their few assets, thus forcing Carrera forces to hide in the mountains . Believing that Carrera was totally defeated, Moraz√°n and Barrundia marched on to Guatemala City where they were welcomed as saviors by the state governor Pedro Valenzuela and members of the conservative Aycinena Clan, who even proposed to sponsor one of the liberal battalions, while Valenzuela and Barrundia gave Moraz√°n all the Guatemalan resources needed to solve any financial problem he had. The criollos of both parties celebrated until dawn that they finally had a caudillo like Morazan, who was able to crush the peasant rebellion. Moraz√°n used the proceeds to support Los Altos and then replaced Valenzuela by Rivera Paz, member of the Aycinena clan, although he did not return to that clan any property confiscated in 1829; in revenge, Juan Jos√© de Aycinena y Pi√±ol voted for the dissolution of the Central American Federation in San Salvador a little later, thereby forcing Moraz√°n to return to El Salvador to fight for his dying federal mandate. Along the way, Moraz√°n increased repression in eastern Guatemala, as punishment for helping Carrera, whom he considered expired. Knowing that Moraz√°n had gone to El Salvador, Carrera tried to take Salam√° with the small force that remained, but was defeated, losing his brother Laureano in combat. With just a few men left, he managed to escape, badly wounded, to Sanarate . After recovering a little bit, attacked a detachment in Jutiapa and managed to get a little booty which he handed to the volunteers who accompanied him and prepared to attack Petapa -near Guatemala City-, where he triumphed, but with heavy casualties . In September of that year, Carrera attempted an assault on the capital of Guatemala, but the liberal general Carlos Salazar Castro defeated him in the fields of Villa Nueva and Carrera had to retreat. After an unsuccessful attempt to take Quetzaltenango, Carrera was surrounded and wounded, and he had to capitulate to the Mexican General Agustin Guzman, who lay in Quetzaltenango since the time of Vicente Fil√≠sola arrival in 1823. Moraz√°n had the opportunity to shoot him, but could not because he needed the support of the Guatemalan peasants to counter the attacks of Francisco Ferrera in El Salvador; instead, Moraz√°n left Carrera in charge of a minute fort in Mita, and without any weapons. Knowing that Moraz√°n was going to attack El Salvador, Francisco Ferrera gave a thousand arms and ammunition to Carrera and convinced him to attack Guatemala City. Meanwhile, despite insistent advice to definitely crush Carrera and his forces, Salazar tried to negotiate with him diplomatically; he even went as far as to show that he neither feared nor distrusted Carrera by removing removed the fortifications that were in place in the Guatemalan capital since the battle of Villa Nueva. Taking advantage of Salazar's good faith and Ferrera's weapons, Carrera caught by surprise Guatemala City on April 13, 1839; at that moment, Castro Salazar, Mariano G√°lvez and Barrundia fled before the arrival of Carrera militia men. Salazar, in his nightshirt, vaulted roofs of neighboring houses and sought refuge; then, as he could, he reached the border disguised as a peasant and fled Guatemala. With Salazar gone, Carrera reinstated Rivera Paz as Head of State of Guatemala = Invasion and absorption of Los Altos = State Coat of Los Altos, carved in stone on the grave of heroes in the Cemetery of Quetzaltenango On April 2 of 1838, in the city of Quetzaltenango, a secessionist group founded the independent State of Los Altos which seeks independence from Guatemala. The most important members of the Liberal Party of Guatemala and liberal enemies of the conservative regime moved to Los Altos, who no longer had to emigrate to El Salvador, having a pro liberal state practically in his country agglutinated The liberals in Los Altos began harshly criticizing the Conservative government of Rivera Paz; even had their own newspaper -El Popular, which contributed to the harsh criticism. Moreover, there was the fact that Los Altos was the region with more production and economic activity of the former State of Guatemala; without Los Altos, conservatives lost many merits that held the hegemony of the State of Guatemala in Central America. Then, the government of Guatemala tried to reach to a peaceful solution, but altenses,Altenses is how people from Quetzaltenango are known in Guatemala. protected by the recognition of the Central American Federation Congress, did not accept; Guatemala's government then resorted to force, sending the commanding general of the Army Rafael Carrera subdue Los Altos. Carrera defeated General Agustin Guzman when the former Mexican officer tried to ambush him and then went on to Quetzaltenango, where he imposed a harsh and hostile conservative regime for liberals. Calling all council members, he told them flatly that he was behaving kindly to them for being that the first time they had challenged him, but sternly warned them that there would be no mercy if there was a second time. Finally, the general Guzm√°n, and the head of state of Los Altos, Marcelo Molina, were sent to the capital of Guatemala, where they were displayed as trophies of war during a triumphant parade on February 17, 1840; in the case of Guzman, shackled, still with bleeding wounds, and riding a mule. = Second invasion and Moraz√°n's defeat = General Francisco Moraz√°n tried to invade Guatemala for the second time in 1840 after having invaded in 1829 and expelled members of the Aycinena clan and regular orders. In 1840 he was defeated by Carrera overwhelmingly, marking the end of his career in Central America On March 18, 1840, liberal caudillo Moraz√°n invaded Guatemala with 1500 soldiers to avenge the insult done in Los Altos and fearing that such action would end with liberal efforts to hold together the Central American Federation. Guatemala had a cordon of guards from the border with El Salvador; without telegraph service, men ran carrying last minute messages. With the information from these messengers, Carrera hatched their plan of defense leaving his brother Sotero by troops who presented a slight resistance in the city. Carrera pretended to flee and led the ragtag army to the heights of Aceituno as only had about four men and the same number of loads rifle, plus two old cannons. The city was at the mercy of the army of Moraz√°n, with bells of their twenty temples ringing for divine assistance. Once Moraz√°n reached the capital, he took it easily and freed Guzman, who immediately left for Quetzaltenango to give the news that Carrera was defeated; Carrera then, taking advantage of what his enemies believed, applied a strategy of concentrating fire on the Central Park of the city and also employed surprise attack tactics with which caused heavy casualties to the army of Moraz√°n to finally force the survivors to fight for their lives.In these battles participated the famous Guatemalan poet Jos√© Batres Mont√∫far Now in such combat scenario, Moraz√°n's soldiers lost the initiative and their numerical superiority. Furthermore, unaware of their surroundings in the city, Morazan's troops had to fight, carry their dead and care for their wounded while still resented being tired by the long march from El Salvador to Guatemala Carrera, by then an experienced military menCarrera even had suffered two previous defeats at the hands of Moraz√°n. was able to stand up and defeat Moraz√°n thoroughly. The disaster for the liberal general was complete: aided by Angel Molina Angel Molina was the son of Guatemalan Liberal leader Pedro Molina Mazariegos. who knew the streets of the city, had to flee with his favorite men, disguised shouting \\"Long live Carrera!\\" through ravine of El Incienso to El Salvador, to save his life. In his absence, Moraz√°n had been relieved as Head of State of that country, which is why he had to embark for exile in Per√∫. In Guatemala, survivors from his troops were shot without mercy, while Carrera was out in pursuit of Morazan, who he failed to catch. This lance definitely sealed the status of General Carrera and marked the decline of Moraz√°n., and forced the conservative Aycinena clan criollos to negotiate with Carrera and his peasant revolutionary supporters. Agustin Guzm√°n, who was freed by Moraz√°n when the latter had seemingly defeated Carrera in Guatemala City, had gone back to Quetzaltenango to tell the good news. The city liberal criollo leaders rapidly reinstated the Los Altos State and celebrated Moraz√°n's victory. However, as soon as Carrera and the newly reinstated Rivera Paz heard the news, Carrera went back to Quetzaltenango with his voluntary army to regain control of the rebel liberal state once and for all. On 2 April 1840, after entering the city, Carrera told the citizens that he had already warned them after he defeated them earlier that year. Then, he ordered the majority of the liberal city hall officials from Los Altos to be shot on his orders. Carrera, then forcibly annexed Quetzaltenango and much of Los Altos back into conservative Guatemala. After the violent and bloody reinstatement of the State of Los Altos by Carrera in April 1840, Luis Batres Juarros -conservative member of the Aycinena Clan then secretary general of the Guatemalan government of recently reinstated Rivera Paz- obtained from the vicar Larrazabal authorization to dismantle the regionalist Church. Acting priests of Quetzaltenango -capital of the would-be-state of Los Altos, priest Urban Ugarte and his coadjutor, priest Jos√© Maria Aguilar, were removed from their parish and likewise the priests of the parishes of San Martin Jilotepeque and San Lucas Tolim√°n. Larrazabal ordered the priests Fernando Antonio D√°vila, Mariano Navarrete and Jose Ignacio Iturrioz to cover the parishes of Quetzaltenango, San Martin Jilotepeque and San Lucas Toliman, respectively. The liberal criollos defeat and execution in Quetzaltenango reinforced Carrera ally status within the native population of the area, whom he respected and protected.  Presidency  Captain General Rafael Carrera after being appointed President for Life of the Republic of Guatemala in 1854. His term of office was in a time of great political turmoil for Guatemala, but he kept general Rafael Carrera by his side to help him.Rafael Carrera was to become the next president of Guatemala When hostilities started with El Salvador in June 1844, Rivera Paz closed the borders to prevent an invasion using inmates of the state border for these the watch over. In December 1844, Rivera Paz presented his irrevocable resignation to the Assembly due to the pressure and demands from Rafael Carrera. = Belgium's colonization attempt = In 1840, Belgium began to act as an external source of support for his independence movement, in an effort to exert influence in Central America. The Compagnie belge de colonisation (Belgian Colonization Company), commissioned by Belgian King Leopold I, became the administrator of Santo Tomas de Castilla for a time, replacing the failed British Eastern Coast of Central America Commercial and Agricultural Company.  Death  In eastern Guatemala, the Jalapa region became increasingly dangerous; rebel leader Vicente Cruz was murdered there after trying to take over the Corregidor office in 1849. On February 26, 1849, when Rivera Paz went to take possession of the provincial government of Jalapa, he was killed by the \\"Lucios\\" Roberto Reyes and Agust√≠n P√©rez in Sampaquisoy, Jalapa.

The album was planned for release in 2011, but the release date had since been pushed to 22 May 2012. Recording sessions for Choice of Weapon began in March 2011 with Chris Goss, who produced the 2010 Capsule EPs. The sessions took place at studios in New York City, Los Angeles, California, and the \\"California desert\\". The album was finished in January 2012. During the recording sessions, Bob Rock teamed up with The Cult for the first time since 2001's Beyond Good and Evil and co-produced Choice of Weapon. Choice of Weapon was named iTunes \\"Rock Album of the Year\\" in 2012. This album marks the first and, so far, only time the band did not make any personnel changes over two consecutive albums. However, it would end up being their final album with bassist Chris Wyse. Background and recording The Cult returned in 2006, after a four-year hiatus, releasing the studio album Born into This in 2007. Although Born into This sold well, The Cult were dropped from Roadrunner Records, and in July 2009, frontman Ian Astbury stated that The Cult would not make any more albums. Asked in September 2009 why The Cult would not make another album, Astbury replied, \\"It's a dead format; we don't have the attention span for albums. By the time you put it out, it's already been leaked. It's a year-and-a-half worth's of work down the fucking tubes. We need to put out bite-sized chunks.\\" Instead of releasing albums, The Cult released two EPs, titled Capsule 1 and Capsule 2, released in September and November 2010 respectively and the band toured to support them. During The Cult's concert at the Hammersmith Apollo in London on 21 January 2011, Astbury declared that The Cult would be recording a new album directly after the tour. They also announced that they would be working with Chris Goss, who performed with Masters of Reality as a supporting act the same evening. On 11 March 2011, it was announced that The Cult were back in the studio recording the album with Goss. By May, the band had been writing and recording new demos at its Witch Mountain studio hideaway in the Hollywood Hills, and began recording their new album at Hollywood Recording Studios. In October 2011, bassist Chris Wyse stated the album was almost finished and expected to be released in April 2012. Wyse also described it as a \\"Zep/Stooges mix of energy.\\" On 29 November 2011, it was announced that the album would be produced by Bob Rock, who provided the same role on Sonic Temple, The Cult and Beyond Good and Evil. The first single from Choice of Weapon, titled \\"For the Animals\\", was made available for online streaming via the Rolling Stone website on 23 March 2012, and was released to radio on 26 March. In October 2012, Weapon of Choice, a collection of ten demo tracks, was made available through iTunes. Reception The album debuted at number 15 in Canada and number 36 in USA. In its first week of sales, the album gained the Number 1 spot on the U.K. Rock Chart on 27/05/2012 (according to the Radio 1 Official Chart).

The brick exterior features terra cotta ornamentation.

Sheraton remodeled the hotel in 1962, moving the lobby from the second floor to the ground floor and converting the hotel to a motel, renaming it the Sheraton-Warrior Motor Inn. In 1968, Sheraton sold the hotel to Gotham Hotels Limited, along with seventeen other aging properties, and it was renamed the Warrior Motor Inn. The hotel closed in 1971 following a strike by employees, but was sold and reopened the following year as the Aventino Motor Inn.http://siouxcityjournal.com/blogs/siouxland_history/business/siouxland- history-aventino-will-be-downtown-hotel-and-convention- center/article_b9ec97e7-df47-5b71-bbcb-4c8f5b9d086b.html It closed permanently in 1976. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. The structure was tagged for building violations in the late 1990s, but was given a reprieve by the city due to its historical significance and the estimated $5 million it would cost to demolish. In 2006, the interior was gutted in preparation for converting the building into low-income senior housing, but the project stalled for lack of financing. In November 2012, a group led by the Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska applied for a gaming license for a proposed $122-million casino and entertainment complex that would integrate the Warrior and the neighboring Davidson Building. State gaming regulators rejected the bid, awarding the license instead to a Hard Rock Casino to be built at the city's historic Battery Building. In July 2017, Restoration St. Louis & Warrior ownership announced a plan to renovate the Warrior Hotel and adjacent Davidson Building into a 148-room Marriott Autograph Hotel at an estimated $73M.

The method involves detecting the location of sequence specific recognition events (e.g., such as hybridization of probes of known sequence) on single DNA molecules in each read, and generating maps of the location of such events. Multiple reads can be assembled into a consensus map that identifies the multiple locations of a specific sub-sequence. The assembly process is greatly facilitated by knowledge of the location of each sub- sequence, as well as the fact that individual reads produce non-contiguous sequence data over length scales that can be orders of magnitude greater than what can be achieved with Sanger sequencing or nextgen sequencing by synthesis. A collection of maps may be used to reconstruct single-base resolved sequence in a process analogous to sequence reconstruction in sequencing by hybridization. Ambiguities in the reconstruction of sequences are resolved through the knowledge of the relative position of overlapping sequence specific recognition events. By varying the parameters (e.g., length of read, density of recognition events, resolution of the detector) governing a specific implementation of the method, it is possible to query all size scales of DNA variation, from single nucleotide sequence all the way to large structural variants and chromosomal aneuploidies.
