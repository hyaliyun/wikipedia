It was the winner at the German National Championships in 1964 and came second in the World Championships the following year. Design and development The Akademische Fliegergruppe of the Technical University of Darmstadt (Akaflieg Darmstadt) was first formed in 1921. It was, and is, a group of aeronautical students who design and construct aircraft as part of their studies and with the help and encouragement of their University. Design work on the Circe began in 1962-3 by a team of students, Wolf Lemke (responsible for the wing), Gerhard Waibel (fuselage and tail) and Heiko Friess (airbrakes). They were later joined by the younger Klaus Holighaus. Professor Franz Wortmann designed a new airfoil for the Circe. Construction began in 1963 and the aircraft flew for the first time, piloted by Wolfe Lemke, on 28 March 1964 at Gelnhausen. The Circe is built from composite materials, with flying surfaces and fuselage shells made from glass-balsa- glass sandwiches. The wings have a single spar with flanges of aligned glass fibre (uni-directional rovings) and a glass-balsa sandwich web. The fuselage has GRP-balsa stiffening cross-members. The wing is tapered in two sections, with more taper on the outer 40% of the span. Such double taper plans can provide lift/drag ratios close to that of the ideal elliptical wing, and have benign stall characteristics. Ailerons occupy all the trailing edge of the outer panels, with flaps across the inner panels. Four sets of Schempp-Hirth airbrakes, two per wing, are located just behind the spar, roughly centred on the inner panels. Each set extends its surfaces, mounted like parallel rulers, above and below the wing. They were difficult to design because of the considerable flexure of the wing, the latter leading to the Circe's nickname of Gummifl√ºgel () at a time of stiffer structures. The fuselage of the Circe is slender and circular in cross section aft of the shoulder mounted wings. The vertical tail is tall and rather upright, with some forward sweep on the rudder trailing edge. The original horizontal T-tail was straight tapered in plan, with sweep only on the leading edge. Forward of the wing leading edge the cockpit, housing the pilot in semi-reclining position, has a long, two piece canopy which swells above the rear fuselage line. The rear part of the canopy opens for access. The Circe has a retractable monowheel undercarriage, assisted by a tail bumper. The testing that followed the first flight showed that there was a tendency to tail flutter, so a long, projecting mass balance was added at the centre of the tailplane. The whole tail was later redesigned by Holighaus who produced a shorter fin and rudder and got rid of the sweep of the original horizontal surface by adding forward swept elevators. The tailplane was also significantly reduced in size. At about the same time as the V-1 was being constructed at Darmstadt, a second Circe, the V-2, was built by Walter Schneider. It differed from the V-1 in having a parachute brake rather than the spoilers of the V-1 and turned out rather heavier. Operational history The V-1, flown by Waibel, won the German National Championships of 1964. Rolf Sp√§rig flew it the following year in the 1965 World Championships, held at RAF South Cerney, Gloucestershire, UK, but was beaten into second place in the open class by the Polish Foka 4 flown by Jan Wroblewski, despite the Circe's better glide ratio. Most agreed the Circe was the most advanced sailplane at the Championships but that the Polish pilot's tactics were superior, not least as the Foka was a 15 m, standard class sailplane. During practice for the Championships, Sp√§rig had flown the first- ever 500 km (311 mi) triangle in Germany. The V-1 flew for another three years before suffering an in-flight structural failure and destruction. The pilot, Heli Lasch escaped by parachute. An investigation blamed him rather than the aircraft; the then still-novel glass sailplanes accelerated quickly and speed was easily misjudged when the traditional indicators, such as attitude or sound, were used. The V-2 remained active until the mid-2000s. Variants ;D-36 Circe V-1: Darmstadt built, Schempp-Hirth airbrakes. ;D-36 Circe V-2: Built by Walter Schneider, drag parachute brake, heavier.

History =Early developments= Railway development on the northern side of the Ganges in Bihar came up soon after the opening of the Howrah‚ÄìDelhi main line on the southern side of the Ganges in 1866. Several railway companies were involvedEast Indian Railway, Assam Behar State Railway, and Tirhut State Railway. In his book The Indian Empire, Its People, History and Products (first published in 1886) W.W.Hunter, says \\"The Tirhut State Railway with its various branches intersects Northern Behar and is intended to extend to the Nepal frontier on one side and to Assam on the other.\\" However, early developments appear to be scattered. EIR built the Katihar‚ÄìKasba and Katihar‚ÄìManihari lines in 1887. Assam Behar State Railway built the Parbatipur‚ÄìKatihar line (see Barsoi‚ÄìParbatipur line) in 1889, thereby linking Assam and parts of North Bengal with Bihar. Tirhoot State Railway built some longer lines such as Samastipur‚ÄìKhagaria, and added branch lines such as the 7 miles long Barauni‚ÄìSemaria Ghat in 1883, the 11 miles long Thana Bihpur to Bararighat in 1901 and Khagaria to Hasanpur Road in 1915. Most of these early metre gauge lines got interconnected in subsequent years. =Bridge links= The construction of the long Rajendra Setu in 1959 provided the first opportunity to link the railway tracks on the north and south banks of the Ganges. The long rail-cum-road bridge located at Munger 55 km downstream of the Rajendra Setu, now under construction, will link Jamalpur station on the Sahibganj Loop line of Eastern Railway to the Barauni‚ÄìKatihar section of East Central Railway. =Railway reorganization= The Avadh‚ÄìTirhut Railway (successor to Tirhut State Railway) was merged with Assam Railway (successor to Eastern Bengal Railway and Assam Bengal Railway) in 1952 to create North Eastern Railway. Northeast Frontier Railway was carved out of North Eastern Railway in 1958. East Central Railway was constituted in 2002 with the Sonpur and Samastipur Divisions of North Eastern Railway, and Danapur, Mughalsarai and Dhanbad Divisions of Eastern Railway. =Gallery= Locale The entire track lies on the northern side of the Ganges and traverses the Kosi basin. In Bihar, the Kosi is widely referred to as the \\"Sorrow of Bihar\\" as it has caused widespread human suffering over the centuries through flooding and frequent changes in course. Over the last 250 years, the Kosi has shifted its course over from east to west. In August 2008, it picked up an old channel it had abandoned over a century ago near the Nepal‚ÄìIndia border, and caused enormous damage in a wide area covering several districts. The breach in the Kosi embankment which caused the devastating flood in 2008, was repaired in 2009 and the river has since been flowing along its original course. The floods continue and threaten even the Barauni‚ÄìKatihar tracks. The entire region portrays \\"a bleak picture of broken houses, flattened fields and ravaged lives, signs of all the havoc the previous floods and land erosion wreaked here earlier.\\" Gauge conversion Gauge conversion work (from metre gauge to broad gauge) in the Barauni‚ÄìKatihar section was taken up in 1978-79 and completed in 1982. In year 2001 Khagaria-Saharsa route was converted into Broad Gauge. Katihar-Jogbani route was converted into Broad Gauge in year 2009. The second main route of this section, Saharsa-Purnia route was converted into Broad Gauge in 2016. Gauge conversion of Saharsa-Forbesganj and Banmankhi-Bihariganj is on progress. Electrification Electrification of the long Barauni‚ÄìKatihar‚ÄìGuwahati section was sanctioned in 2008. As of 2011, work on electrification of Barabanki‚ÄìGorakhpur‚ÄìBarauni‚ÄìNew Jalpaiguri route was in progress. Adequate funds have been provided in the budget for 2011‚Äì12 to take up work in the New Jalapiguri‚ÄìNew Bongaigaon‚ÄìGuwahati section. The section is fully electrified. Most of the Delhi and Amritsar bounded train runs on electric locomotives. Amrapali Express was the first train to run on electric locomotive, then after Rajdhani express, North-east Express, Purvottar Sampark kranti Express, Seemanchal Express, Tripura Sundari Express have electric engines.

Davenport Road streetcar. Davenport Road is an east‚Äìwest arterial road in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is believed to follow an old native trail along the foot of the scarp of the old shoreline of glacial Lake Iroquois. It currently runs from Yonge Street in the east to Old Weston Road in the west. The road is believed to follow part of a First Nations trail, connecting the Don River and the Humber River. It was known as \\"Gete-Onigaming,\\" Ojibwe for \\"at the old portage.\\" From the Don River, the trail followed the Rosedale Valley Road up to the current Davenport Road. The trail followed Davenport to Old Weston Road and St. Clair Avenue, then west along St. Clair to the Lambton area, then followed the route of the current Dundas Street to the Humber. The trail, which continued along the modern route of Kingston Road east of the Don, and what is now Dundas Street west of the Humber. The Toronto portion of the trail had several earlier names, including \\"Plank Road\\", \\"Bull Road\\", and \\"the new road to Niagara\\"‚Äîbut by 1797, it was known as Davenport Road. The section east of Bathurst Street was originally a part of Vaughan Road. The road was named after the 1797 Davenport house of soldier John McGill, situated in the vicinity of the northeast corner of Bathurst and Davenport. Colonel Joseph Wells bought the property and demolished the house in 1821. Wells served as a legislator, bank director and treasurer of Upper Canada College. George Dupont Wells, his son, inspired the naming of Dupont Street and Wells Hill Avenue. The road was paved outside of York, Upper Canada in 1833, with the improvements to be paid for by tolls. Tollkeepers' cottages were constructed every few kilometres, the cottage near what is now the intersection of Bathurst Street and Davenport Road surviving to the present day. During the 1837 Upper Canada Rebellion rebel leader William Lyon Mackenzie personally burned the home of Dr. R. C. Horne a prominent Tory, at the corner of Davenport Road and Yonge Street. On April 20, 1891 the newly incorporated Davenport Street Railway Company was awarded rights to operate a streetcar by West Toronto Junction. When the route began operation on September 6, 1892, it was the second electrified streetcar line in the Toronto area‚Äîearlier routes being horse-drawn. The route ran from Keele and Dundas streets to Bathurst and Dupont streets. In 1894, the Davenport Street Railway Company was purchased by the Toronto Suburban Street Railway Company, which was in turn acquired by the owners of the Canadian Northern Railway. The line had originally used a broad gauge, like Toronto's other streetcar lines‚Äîso railway companies couldn't run freight on ordinary streets. Although it was later changed to standard gauge no freight was ever carried. In 1896, The Daily Mail and Empire published a letter from a reader responding to recent article on roads requiring repair in Toronto described Davenport as being in \\"simply disgraceful condition\\". The reader described Davenport Road, and several other roads, as being \\"block paved\\", and complained \\"this kind of pavement is anything but durable\\"‚Äîdue either to Toronto's climate, or poor construction. In 1912, the farm at the south-west corner of Bathurst Street and Davenport became the Hillcrest Racetrack of Abe Orpen. The track was only open for a few years, closing in 1916. The site is now the Hillcrest Yard of the Toronto Transit Commission. In 1994, bicycle lanes were added to Davenport Road.

History A version in colored chalks, dated 1880. In his Proserpine, the artist illustrates in his typical Pre-Raphaelite style the Roman goddess who lives in the underworld during Winter. Although Rossetti inscribed the date 1874 on the picture, he worked for seven years on eight separate canvases before he finished with it. His Proserpine, like his model Jane Morris, is an exquisitely beautiful woman, with delicate facial features, slender hands, and flawlessly pale skin set off by her thick raven hair. Rossetti painted it at a time when his mental health was extremely precarious and his love for Jane Morris was at its most obsessive.V. Surtees, Dante Gabriel Rossetti 1828‚Äì1882. The Paintings and Drawings, Clarendon Press (1971), I, pp. 131‚Äì4. Rossetti wrote about Proserpine > She is represented in a gloomy corridor of her palace, with the fatal fruit > in her hand. As she passes, a gleam strikes on the wall behind her from some > inlet suddenly opened, and admitting for a moment the sight of the upper > world; and she glances furtively towards it, immersed in thought. The > incense-burner stands beside her as the attribute of a goddess. The ivy > branch in the background may be taken as a symbol of clinging memory.Cf. > W.E. Fredeman (ed.), The correspondence of Dante Gabriel Rossetti, 7 Vols., > Brewer (2002‚Äì8). Unable to decide as a young man whether to concentrate on painting or poetry, his work is infused with his poetic imagination and an individual interpretation of literary sources. His accompanying sonnet to this work is a poem of longing: \\"And still some heart unto some soul doth pine,\\" (see sonnet below) carrying an inescapable allusion to his yearning to seduce Jane from her unhappy marriage with William Morris. Proserpine had been imprisoned in Pluto's underground realm for tasting the forbidden pomegranate. Jane, trapped by convention, was also tasting forbidden fruit.See critique at The Victorian Web, also here. There is a deeper meaning in the painting as Rossetti stayed with Jane at Kelmscott Manor during the summer months each year and in winter she returned to stay with William Morris, thus paralleling Proserpine's freedom during summer. In Greek and Roman mythology, Proserpine daughter of Ceres, was carried off to the Underworld (Hades) by Pluto, who married her despite her love for Adonis. When Ceres begged Jupiter to return her daughter to Earth, he agreed, on condition that Proserpine had not eaten any fruits in Hades. As Proserpine had eaten six pomegranate seeds, it was decreed that she should remain in Hades for six months of the year and be allowed on Earth for the other six. The symbolism in Rossetti's painting poignantly indicates Proserpine's plight, as well as Jane Morris's plight, torn between her husband, the father of her two adored daughters, and her lover. The pomegranate draws the viewer's eye, the colour of its flesh matching the colour of Proserpine's full lips. The ivy behind her, as Rossetti stated, represents clinging memory and the passing of time; the shadow on the wall is her time in Hades, the patch of sunlight, her glimpse of earth. Her dress, like spilling water, suggests the turning of the tides, and the incense burner denotes the subject as an immortal. Proserpine's saddened eyes, which are the same cold blue color as most of the painting, indirectly stare at the other realm. Overall, dark hues characterise the color scheme of the piece.L. Parris (ed.), The Pre-Raphaelites, exhibition catalogue, Tate Gallery (1984), pp. 231‚Äì2. The inscribed sonnet Rossetti's eighth and final version of Proserpine, now in the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery (1882) On the top right of the canvas \\"Proserpina\\" is inscribed by the artist, followed by his sonnet in Italian. The same sonnet in English is inscribed on the frame: > :Afar away the light that brings cold cheer :Unto this wall, ‚Äì one instant > and no more :Admitted at my distant palace-door :Afar the flowers of Enna > from this drear :Dire fruit, which, tasted once, must thrall me here. :Afar > those skies from this Tartarean grey :That chills me: and afar how far away, > :The nights that shall become the days that were. :Afar from mine own self I > seem, and wing :Strange ways in thought, and listen for a sign: :And still > some heart unto some soul doth pine, :(Whose sounds mine inner sense in fain > to bring, :Continually together murmuring) ‚Äî :'Woe me for thee, unhappy > Proserpine'. :‚Äî D. G. Rossetti The painting is signed and dated on a scroll at lower left: 'DANTE GABRIELE ROSSETTI RITRASSE NEL CAPODANNO DEL 1874' (Dante Gabriel Rossetti painted this at the beginning of 1874). The frame, designed by Rossetti, has roundels which resemble a section of a pomegranate, reflecting the sliced pomegranate in Proserpine's hand.

Early versions were promised to Charles Augustus Howell. The painting discussed in this article is the so- called seventh version commissioned by Frederick Richards Leyland, now at the Tate Gallery, with the very similar final version now at the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery. Leyland commissioned eighteen paintings from Rossetti, not counting unfulfilled commissions. Soon after Leyland acquired his first Rossetti painting, he and Rossetti explored the idea of a Rossetti triptych, which was eventually formed with Mnemosyne, The Blessed Damozel, and Proserpine.Waking Dreams, p. 204. Three additional Rossetti paintings were then hung in Leyland's drawing room, all of which Leyland called \\"stunners.\\"Waking Dreams, p. 26. (figure 5).

As a child Penn attended public schools in Lynchburg, Virginia and then Hampton Institute and Virginia Normal and Industrial School (Virginia State University). He first attended medical school at Leonard Medical School for Blacks (Shaw University) in Raleigh, North Carolina before being invited to attend Yale Medical School in 1893. He graduated in 1897, the first African-American to do so, as well as the first African-American to head the university yearbook.Geraldine Rhoades Beckford Biographical Dictionary of American Physicians of African Ancestry, 1800-1920, p. 251 In 1898 he met and later married Lula Tompkins, taking her son, Louis T.

Penn had a significant influence on Wright, who also pursued a career in medicine, graduating fourth in his class at Harvard Medical School and serving as the first African-American surgeon on staff at the Harlem Hospital. Penn was a founding member of the Atlanta chapter of the NAACP in 1917, a national organization for which his stepson Louis would later serve as chairman.

It was founded in 1974, following the successful democratic uprising of October 1973. The New Force Party was one of the more successful left-wing parties during the relatively progressive and democratic phase from 1974 to 1976. Progressive liberal and reformist in its stances, it was considered more moderate than the Socialist Party of Thailand. In the 1975 general election, the first free election after long military dictatorship, the party won 6.0% of the votes and 12 of 269 seats in the House of Representatives. The new leftist parties, together with the long-standing liberal Democrat Party, were placed on the opposition benches. In the run-up to the 1976 election, the party was harassed by its right-wing adversaries. The party's office was attacked and candidates were assassinated by the far-right and military-backed Red Gaurs paramilitary. Its right-wing opponents accused the New Force Party of siding with the communists in Vietnam and Laos, of having received 152 million baht from the KGB, and of having leaders of Vietnamese descent. The party could stabilize its share of the votes at 6.8%, but only three of its candidates were successful in their respective constituencies. After the democracy movement was shattered in the Thammasat University massacre on 6 October 1976, the role of the New Force Party was gradually diminished to a tiny splinter party. In the 1979 election, it won 2.8% of votes and 8 of 301 seats (mostly representing constituencies in Northeastern Thailand). After the 1983 election, New Force was extraparliamentary, after 1986 it held a sole seat in parliament. The party was replaced by the \\"Social Democratic Force Party\\" on 26 March 1988, which remained electorally unsuccessful. The party was founded and led by medicine professor Dr. Krasae Chanawongse, the recipient of the 1973 Ramon Magsaysay Award for Community Leadership. In 1988, Krasae joined the Palang Dharma Party, and became foreign minister in 1995. Its secretary- general was Pramote Nakhontap, a political science professor, who later became an activist of the People's Alliance for Democracy (\\"Yellow Shirts\\") and authored an article about the alleged Finland Plot. Popular singer Suthep Wongkamhaeng was the party's secretary-general during the 1980s.

It contains a variety of independent shops, restaurants, commercial art galleries, and the Savoy Theatre. Until the 1830s, when Priory Street was built to bypass it, it was the main thoroughfare into the centre of Monmouth from the north-east, linking the market and the parish church. It was at one time the centre of the town's butchery trade and was known as Butcher's Row. History Agincourt square According to local writer and antiquarian Charles Heath in 1804: Charles Heath, Historical and descriptive accounts of the ancient and present state of the town of Monmouth:..., 1804 > Church Street was originally a mere thoroughfare, scarcely wide enough to > admit a loaded waggon to pass through it.

George Nicholson, The Cambrian traveller's guide, and pocket companion, 1840, p.457 According to local tradition, a local gingerbread maker, Mrs Syner, was closing the shutters of her shop one evening when the mail coach to Liverpool went through at a gallop. Her apron strings were caught in one of the horses' harnesses, and she was dragged along the ground for some distance. Escaping serious injury, she grabbed the coachman's whip, knocked out some of his teeth with the handle, and marched back to her shop to begin organising a petition for a new road to be built to bypass Church Street. The Borough Council then organised a competition for the best scheme, with a prize of ¬£10 for the winner. The prize was won by local architect George Vaughan Maddox, who proposed a new carriage road ‚Äî now Priory Street ‚Äî on a viaduct immediately above the bank of the River Monnow.

At , it was the tallest building in the city until the completion of the River House Condominiums in 2008. The building contains apartments on floors 8‚Äì14, individually owned condominiums on floors 15‚Äì32, and a 214-room Courtyard by Marriott hotel on floors 1‚Äì7.  Building history  =Construction and early issues= Construction began in 1988 with $60 million financed to Havlik by Amway and a Japanese bank. The building opened in 1991 as Eastbank Waterfront Towers during a mini-boom in downtown development. However, it experienced significant structural, water leakage, and HVAC problems and had to be closed and completely re-skinned in 1995‚Äì97, just five years after opening. Vertical cracks in exterior cement panels were the cause of the water leakage, which soaked and molded interior carpets. Corroded pipes caused issues with the cooling system and air ducts distributed foul smells. The $36 million 1995 renovation was financed by Amway, who gained majority ownership. 250 residents and 160 building employees were displaced for two years during renovation work. Prior to reopening, the Radisson hotel chain left the project and the name of the building was changed to Plaza Towers. Eenhoorn LLC bought the building from Amway for $17.5 million in 2001. Amway's $31.5 million loss in the project was a ‚Äúphilanthropic gesture‚Äù for downtown development. Many legal battles took place over the faulty construction, excessive initial project cost, and renovation displacements. =Evacuations for fire= Small fires in the building have led to evacuations in 1996, 2001, 2002, and 2010. The 2010 evacuation was due to a 17th-floor fire causing fire and water damage, but no injuries. =Evacuations for flood= Refacing the building to correct for rain-related water leakage from exterior cracks displaced 250 residents and 160 building employees two years. The building was again evacuated on April 20, 2013, as the flooded Grand River filled the lower level mechanical space and flooded the basement parking garage with over 7 feet of water. A waterlogged basement generator sent black smoke through the entire building and approximately 80 vehicles parked in the basement garage were flooded with up to 11 feet of water. Structural concerns for a sanitary sewer line under the building (dating back to a time when Campau Ave. extended to Fulton, where the building now stands) caused building maintenance to keep the lowest level of the building flooded until the river receded to prevent erosion under the building and around the sewer line, which prolonged the evacuation. The evacuation lasted until the building reopened on May 8, 2013.

Ancient biographies record that he was from Jianchang. He is said to have become a monk when he was sixteen at Shimen Temple with Baizhang Huaihai as his teacher. After twenty years with him, Baizhang died and Yuyan had still had not attained enlightenment. He visited many teachers before settling on Yaoshan Weiyan as his new master. The first part of his name comes from Yunyan Mountain, which is outside of modern Changsha, where he taught after studying with Yaoshan. Recorded dialogues involving Yunyan often include him and his fellow student, Daowu Yuanzhi. He supposedly died from illness, the day before which he ordered his students to prepare for a banquet because a monk was preparing to depart the monastery. A well known poem, the Song of the Precious Mirror SamƒÅdhi, is attributed to Yunyan in Juefan Huihong's biographical compilation of 1119, the Chanlin sengbao zhuan (Chronicle of the Sa·πÖgha Treasure in the Groves of Ch√°n). This is the first time this poem is mentioned in the historical record. Huihong writes that the poem was given to Dongshan Liangjie, Yunyan's student, but that he believes Yunyan's teacher probably gave it to him in turn. Huihong further relates that he came upon the poem in 1108, when it was given to a scholar Zhu Yan by a monk, whom he does not identify. The scholar Morten Schl√ºtter notes that the poem's provenance is doubtful given the way it came to Huihong, and furthermore the style differs substantially from works of the era that Huihong attributes it to. Most later historical sources, such as the Zengaku daijiten, the Bussho kaisetsu daijiten, and Shinsan zenseki mokuroku, attribute the poem to Dongshan Liangjie rather than Yunyan, although again, neither is likely. Appearance in K≈çan A number of k≈çan dialogues feature Yunyan and his fellow student Daowu Yuanzhi. Case 54 of the Book of Equanimity, Case 89 of the Blue Cliff Record, case 105 from D≈çgen's Shinji Sh≈çb≈çgenz≈ç, and the chapter \\"Kannon\\" from D≈çgen's Kana Sh≈çb≈çgenz≈ç, and all involve the same story in which Yunyan and Daowu discuss the purpose of Avalokite≈õvara's many hands and eyes.

Founded in 1869, the current building was constructed in 1921 and is located adjacent to the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Park. The church is notable for the role it played in the Civil Rights Movement, especially under the leadership of William Holmes Borders, who served as pastor of the church from 1937 to 1988.  History  The church was founded in 1869 by members of First Baptist Church in Atlanta (now known as Friendship Baptist Church) who wanted a place of worship closer to where they lived. Seven members founded Mt. Pleasant Baptist Church on Howell Street, originally holding service under a bush arbor. Andrew Jackson would serve as the church's first pastor, a position he would hold until 1874. The church would relocate several times before moving to its present location on Auburn Avenue (at the time known as Wheat Street, hence the present name). In 1881, the church played a role in the Atlanta washerwomen strike, as a meeting of over 500 strikers was held in the church. In 1894, the Butler Street YMCA was formed in the basement of the church building. From 1898 to 1928, P. James Bryant served as the church's pastor. The current building was built in August 1921 after the previous building was destroyed in the Great Atlanta fire of 1917. In 1932, Wheat Street hosted a meeting of the NAACP. In 1937, William Holmes Borders became the church pastor, a position he would hold until 1988. Borders would become a prominent activist in the civil rights movement, influencing a young Martin Luther King Jr. King would often attend sermons held by Borders, and Borders's wife had been King's English teacher. Wheat Street is notable for its community outreach programs. On March 7, 1956, it became one of the first churches in the United States, and the first black church, to sponsor a federal credit union. The church also maintains a charitable foundation and housing ministry, and in 1999 held over $33 million worth of real estate, making it one of the richest black churches in the United States.

The first colonial administrator was Albert Van Duerne, who laid out the boundaries of the chiefdoms in the territory and ordered that small villages be consolidated into larger ones. A chapel was built at Luozi by missionaries between 1903 and 1906. The chapel and the administrative buildings were burned down in 1909 in violence that followed an outbreak of smallpox and sleeping sickness, for which the whites were blamed. A military station was established at Luozi. A trading post was opened in 1927 by the Compagnie Belge du Commerce and an airstrip was built, with the first flight landing in December 1928. In February 1933 Luozi was made capital of the Manianga Territory, and in 1949 capital of Luozi Territory. In 1949 a hospital was opened, with wards for men and women, an operating room, administrative building and staff quarters. The same year, a paved road was opened linking Luozi to Matadi and Boma.

Penney building in Anchorage The J. C. Penney Store in Anchorage, Alaska is a department store and part of the United States retail chain J. C. Penney. The store was established in 1962 on Fifth Avenue in downtown Anchorage, making J. C. Penney one of the first national retailers to establish a presence in the state following Alaska's admission to the union as the 49th state in 1959. The store has been housed in two buildings on the same Fifth Avenue site since it opened. The store's original site, known locally as The Penney Building, was effectively destroyed during the 1964 Alaska earthquake. It was one of the larger buildings in Anchorage to fall due to the shaking, rather than to ensuing landslides. A larger store was rebuilt on the same location, which later included a parking garage on an adjacent block connected by a skywalk. These structures and the later Northern Commercial Company department store (which was purchased by Nordstrom several years after it was built), formed the foundation of the 5th Avenue Mall. The building currently features a Whaling Wall mural along its west wall. History The original Penney Building in Anchorage in 1964, following the earthquake. The J. C. Penney parking garage as it appeared from the corner of Sixth Avenue and E Street in August 2015. J. C. Penney built its first Alaska store in 1962, located on the southwest corner of Fifth Avenue and D Street in downtown Anchorage. The company acquired the site by executing a 55-year lease with Hoyt Motors, one of Anchorage's earliest automobile dealerships. Hoyt Motors folded upon vacating the site, part of a trend in early 1960s Anchorage of dealerships changing ownership and moving out of downtown and to the Glenn Highway and Seward Highway corridors. The Penney Building in Anchorage was five stories tall and almost in size. It partially collapsed and was damaged beyond repair during the 1964 Alaska earthquake. Precast concrete wall panels (one story tall and about as wide apiece) fell to the streets below during the shaking, which resulted in deaths as well as near-misses. The company continued to sell its wares, operating out of rented storefront space and its warehouse on East Fifth Avenue. The Penney Building was torn down to its foundation and was rebuilt as a three-story building, with the footprint slightly more than doubled to extend south to Sixth Avenue. The loss of parking which resulted, led the company to construct Anchorage's first public parking garage, which opened in 1968.Cole, North To The Future, p. 225 The garage is connected to the store by a second-level skywalk spanning Sixth Avenue. Over the decades, the garage's ground level, known mostly as the Penney Mall, housed a variety of retail businesses, both operated by the company and by other merchants. A People Mover \\"mini transit center\\" was located underneath the entrance ramp for many years. It was torn down when the bus stops for the Penney Mall and the federal building on Seventh Avenue were moved elsewhere. Another structure currently occupies that space. The store, along with the front portion of the Reeve Building directly across D Street, was integrated with the design of the 5th Avenue Mall when it was built in 1987. The construction of the mall led to the vacation of that block of D Street. As a result, the store's eastern entrance was reconstructed to let out directly into the mall on multiple floors. Other J.C. Penney locations in Alaska J. C. Penney also constructed a store in Fairbanks, which opened in 1966. It was located in Alaska's first urban renewal district. Several blocks of downtown Fairbanks, which previously consisted mostly of log cabins, including a former red-light district, were cleared, and a block of Sixth Avenue was vacated. In its place were constructed large office and commercial buildings, with the Penney store and a state office and courthouse building (the latter building currently home to the UAF Community and Technical College) the largest. Safeway and Woolworth's also built stores in this area at around the same time. The Fairbanks store, particularly its second floor, served as a refuge during another natural disaster, the 1967 flood. The company closed this store in 1998 during a nationwide round of store closings. The building is currently owned by a local furniture retailer, Sadler's Home Furnishings. See also * J.C.

The company, owned by the larger mining organizations, Cline Resource and Development Group, is at the center of a dispute among politicians, community groups, environmental organizations, Native American tribal councils and various stakeholders because of a proposed mining project scheduled for operation in Iron and Ashland counties in northern Wisconsin. Proposed project Designed to produce low-grade taconite pellets used for steelmaking, the project under consideration in northern Wisconsin might yield up to 2 billion tons of ore across the 22-mile long lease property, according to company figures. The $1.5 billion project (in terms of taxable revenue) sits amongst the remote Penokee Hills south of Lake Superior, and most of the initial work is to be done in a 4 to 5-mile section near the town of Mellen, 20 miles south of the Bad River Band tribal reservation in Odanah, Wi. With lease rights covering over 21,000 acres, the project would be the largest open pit iron-ore mine in the world, and requires legislative action in the Wisconsin State Legislature to advance. Hurley, Wi has a long history of mining in the area. Mining began somewhere around 1880http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/turningpoints/search.asp?id=696 when the first iron was discovered. Both shaft and open mining, like the process proposed by Gogebic Taconite, have been recorded since the late 1800s in the area. Hurley, Wi is more known for its lake effect snow falls, miles of snowmobiling trails, hunting, fishing and local ski hills, but that wasn't always the case. The entire area, both historically and culturally, is an area of both mining and logging. The Hurley High School mascott is the \\"Midgets\\" due to a team that went to state that was made up of short players. A mainstay food in the area is the pasty, which was brought over from the English miners to the area in the late 1800s. You will find bars named the Iron Nugget, Freddie's Old Time Saloon, and the Iron Horse Inn which encompass the rich history of the area. For decades in the late 19th century and into the 1920s, the Gogebic was one of the nation‚Äôs chief sources of iron. Iron from the Gogebic helped to fuel the industrial boom in the Upper Midwest during these years. By 1930 mining was winding down in the area. The mines began closing in amid a national economy suffering from the Great Depression. The result was widespread economic devastation in the Gogebic Range. The Montreal and Cary mines closed in the 1960s when the steel industry changed from using high- grade iron ore from deep shaft mines to using abundant taconite ore that could be economically mined by the open-pit method. At the time of closing, the Montreal and Cary mines were producing ore from workings nearly one mile deep. The last iron ore from the Gogebic Iron Range in Wisconsin was shipped from the Cary Mine in Hurley in 1965.http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&term;_id=12112&term;_type_id=2&term;_type_text=Places&letter;=I The mines can still be seen in the historical mining houses along the Carey stretch and Montreal areas. The mining industry sustained the area for 85 years with no known environmental effects. When Gogebic Taconite began pursuing an iron ore mine in northern Wisconsin, the numbers grabbed both supporters and opponents. =Controversy= Proponents of the project say that the first mining phase will last 35 years and create 700 direct mining jobs. Opponents question the jobs claim, say that the mine will harm the environment and pollute local water sources, including sloughs where Bad River tribal members hold traditional rice harvests. More recent controversy has focused on the present state of the Bad River that runs within the reservation. In particular, opponents have noted that the presence of iron sulphide in the overburden could cause acid mine drainage. Legislators, including Republican Governor Scott Walker, have voiced their support for the mine, while state Democrats, environmental groups like the Sierra Club, all 11 sovereign Tribal Nations in Wisconsin, including the local Bad River Band of the Lake Superior Tribe of Chippewa Indians, most of the cities in the area of the proposed mine (including La Pointe, Ashland, Bayfield and Washburn), are in opposition even though these cities are not located in the mining zone. However, these towns are within the Lake Superior watershed area and will be affected by the water and air pollution created by the mine. Hurley, Wi, which is historically and culturally a mining town and Mellen, Wi are open to the proposal. These would be the closest towns within the mining zone. In July 2013, the mine site owners hired armed security to guarantee the safety of the work site and employees after protesters attacked a local woman hired to watch the companies equipment.http://dangerousminds.net/comments/masked_heavily_armed_paramilitary_rent_a_cops_are_freaking_out_wisconsin The Security company hired is \\"BulletProof\\" from Arizona, who patrol armed and in BDU's. The company then came to an agreement with local law enforcement and continued to use local residents to monitor property. On March 24, 2015 Gogebic Taconite withdrew the preapplication notice related to the proposed mine. The site was closed during the application period to the public. Since the withdrawal of the application it is now back open to the public for hunting, fishing, hiking, sight-seeing and cross-country skiing.

Between July 1813 and June 1814 he ran five times and was unbeaten, his wins climaxing with The Derby of 1814. After that he had only one further race, at the beginning of the 1815 flat season, in which he placed second. He was then retired to stud at Marelands near Farnham, Surrey. Blucher had little success as a sire but was an ancestor in the dam's line of the double classic winner Pretender (1866). Background Blucher's sire, Waxy Blucher was a bay horse bred by Henry Bilson-Legge, 2nd Baron Stawell. His sire was the Derby winner Waxy (1790-1818) and his dam Pantina.The Sporting Magazine, October 1816 (bound into vol. 49, dated 1817), p. 1 Through Waxy, Blucher was descended from the Darley Arabian. Through his dam, Blucher was twice descended from the noble Herod, the foundation sire through whom the direct male line of the Byerley Turk survives. He was again inbred from Herod through Waxy's dam, Maria, a mare bred by Lord Bolingbroke. Herod was himself inbred from two of the offspring of the Darley Arabian, one of them being the undefeated Flying Childers. Waxy had won the Derby in 1793 and had continued racing until he was injured as a seven-year-old in 1797, when he retired, going to stud the next year and becoming an influential sire. His offspring included three Derby winners, Whalebone and Whisker as well as Blucher. Waxy's own sire, Pot-8-Os, won thirty-four races during a seven-year racing career. As well as Waxy, Pot-8-Os produced Parasol, the dam of Partisan and Lottery. Waxy's full-brother, Worthy (foaled 1795), had won races and became a breeding stallion for the East India Company. Racing career Blucher first ran at the Newmarket Houghton meeting of 1813, winning a fifteen-guineas Sweepstakes handicap for two-year-old colts and fillies. He started as the six to four on favourite in a field of three. He next ran at the Newmarket Craven meeting of 1814, easily winning a two-hundred guineas Produce Stakes for three-year-old colts and fillies. He started at very short odds of three and four to one on and comfortably beat Vittoria. At the Newmarket first Spring meeting he won the Newmarket Stakes (fifty guineas each), starting at two to one on and again winning easily in a field of nine which included Zadora and Kutusoff. Coming to Epsom, on 26 May he won the 1814 Derby, ridden by William Arnull, one of a famous family of jockeys. Arnull had ridden Derby winners twice before, with Hannibal in 1804 and Octavius in 1812.Derby Winners 1780-1851 at georgianindex.net, accessed 31 January 2012 The Derby of 1814 had a record number of entries, with no fewer than fifty- one.J. A. Mangan, Pleasure, Profit, Proselytism: British culture and sport at home and abroad, 1900‚Äì1914, p. 38: \\"The Derby attracted a record entry of 51, and Alexander, King of Prussia, Tsar Alexander I of Russia and General Bl√ºcher were there to see the aptly named 'Blucher' win. The enthusiasm was rapturous. Later, at Ascot, where Bl√ºcher attended the Gold Cup, even the Prince Regent was included in the cheers.\\" Blucher, who started the favourite at odds of five to two and three to one, narrowly beat a Haphazard colt, the third favourite, who had led from the start and was overtaken only at the very end. Other runners included Bourbon, Grand Duchess, Jeweller, Kutusoff, Monkey, Osman, Robin Adair, Sir Tooley Whagg O'Shaughnashane, Wanderer, Wilmington, and an Eagle colt. Bl√ºcher, the Prussian commander in whose honour Blucher was named The Derby of 1814, falling on 26 May, came only weeks after the end of the War of the Sixth Coalition, which culminated at the end of March in the capture of Paris by a Coalition army led by Field Marshal Bl√ºcher, after whom the horse Blucher had been named, and the abdication of Napoleon Bonaparte on 6 April. In June the Allied sovereigns and their courts made a triumphant visit to England. Those attending the Epsom meeting at which Blucher won the Derby included the King of Prussia and Field Marshal Bl√ºcher, and the crowd's rapturous welcome was crowned by Blucher's victory in the main race of the day. Blucher ran next at Runnymede, Egham, where he won the Magna Charta Stakes of fifty guineas each for three-year-old colts and fillies, starting a very short-odds favourite at four and even five to one on and comfortably beating a Haphazard filly. He had no more outings during the 1814 flat season. At the Newmarket first spring meeting of 1815, the horse's triumphant unbeaten career came to an end. In the Port Stakes handicap race for all comers, one hundred guineas each, with seven runners, Blucher started as favourite at six to four and five to four on, but was beaten into second place by his half- sister Wire, a three-year old filly by Waxy out of Penelope. After this defeat Blucher was taken out of training and sent to stud. Blucher's conqueror, Wire, went on to win many more races. She was soon sold, for three thousand guineas, and her new owner took her to Ireland, where in 1816 she won more prize money than any other horse. She was retired to become an important brood mare at Westport, County Mayo, breeding many winners.Waxy at Thoroughbred Heritage, accessed 2 February 2012 Sire Following his retirement, Blucher stood as a stallion at Marelands near Farnham, Surrey, priced at ten and a half guineas for a nomination. He had surprisingly little success as a racehorse sire, but on Scheherazade he got the mare Favourite, the dam's dam's dam of the double classic winner Pretender (foaled 1866).

It is the Old Icelandic translation of the Daretis Phrygii De Excidio Troiae Historia (Dares Phrygius‚Äô History of the Destruction of Troy). The saga expands on the basic framework provided by Dares to create a story with many particularly Norse elements and values. Composition and sources Tr√≥jumanna saga was most likely composed by an Icelander in the mid-thirteenth century. Today there exist three separate and different redactions of Tr√≥jumanna saga, themselves dating from probably the thirteenth and fourteenth century. These are known as the Hauksb√≥k, Beta, and the Alpha redactions. Tr√≥jumanna saga Alpha, though the last to be discovered by modern scholars, is the closest to Dares' Historia in that it uses fewer supplementary sources than the other two versions. As such, it was published as Tr√≥jumanna saga: The Dares Phrygius Version, by Jonna Louis-Jensen.Louis- Jensen Randi Claire Eldevik states that although Tr√≥jumanna saga Alpha has only a few sources other than De Excidio Troiae Historia, \\"its treatment of [De Excidio Troiae Historia] is elaborately embellished in comparison with the other two redactions.\\" These other sources are the Ilias Latina attributed to Publius Baebius Italicus, and Heroides by Ovid. Synopsis of the Alpha Redaction The saga begins with the journey of Jason and his Argonauts. On the way to find the Golden Fleece they stop at Troy. Laomedon, King of Troy, forces Jason to leave his lands for fear of a Greek invasion. This is the start of a feud between the Trojans and the Greeks. After Jason acquires the Golden Fleece, he remains in Phrygia with Medea. Hercules, however, gathers a Greek army and returns to Troy. After a brief war, Troy falls and Telamon takes Laomedon's daughter and Priam's sister, Hesione, back to Greece. Priam, after rebuilding Troy, summons his five sons: Hector, Alexander (Paris), Deiphobus, Helenus, and Troilus, and they decide to avenge their grandfather, Laomedon. Alexander tricks Helen into vowing to marry him by tossing a golden apple into her lap. On the apple is inscribed, \\"I swear by the god that I shall be wed to Alexander and be his queen henceforward,\\"Eldevik, 225 which Helen unwittingly reads aloud, thus binding herself by oath to Alexander, who takes her back to Greece, inciting the Trojan War. The course of the war is described in detail from the first landing of the Greeks to the taking of the city. Hector is Troy's greatest protector until he is slain by Achilles in an even fight. After this Troilus and the rest of the sons of Priam fill the role. Achilles is a less central character to the story than in Homer's Iliad, though he is still most often responsible for the deaths of prominent Trojans. He falls in love with Polyxena, Priam's daughter, is drawn into an ambush for her sake, and is assassinated by Alexander after a heroic last stand. Antenor and Aeneas, along with many townsmen, betray the city by letting the Greeks in during the night. Neoptolemus Pyrrhus, son of Achilles, kills Priam at the altar of Thor. In the days following the sack of the city Neoptolemus searches for and finds Polyxena (who had been under Aeneas' protection). Blaming her for his father's death, Neoptolemus insists on her execution. After she defends herself in a passionate, but futile speech, he cuts off her head. The saga closes with a very brief summary of the Greeks' return home and the casualty counts of the war.A synopsis of the English translation of Eldevik, 205-286  Editions  * J√≥n Sigur√∞sson, ed. \\"Tr√≥jumanna saga.\\" In \\"Trojumanna saga ok Breta sogur efter Hauksbok, med dansk Oversaettelse\\", Annaler for nordisk Historie (1848), 4-100 (Hauksb√≥k version; repr. as Trojumanna saga hin forna, prentu√∞ eftir √∫tg√°fu J√≥ns Sigur√∞ssonar i donskum Annalum 1848 (Reykjavik: Prentsmioja D.

(March 15, 1896June 18, 1972) was an American Catholic priest and Jesuit who became the president of Loyola College in Maryland and later of Georgetown University. Born in Baltimore, Maryland, he was educated at Loyola College before entering the Society of Jesus in 1919. While continuing his education at St. Andrew-on-Hudson and Woodstock College, he taught dramatics at Fordham University. He then completed his doctorate at the Pontifical Gregorian University and taught at Brooklyn Preparatory School and Canisius College. In 1938, he became the president of Loyola College, and his term was largely defined by a protracted legal dispute with the Archbishop of Baltimore, Michael Curley, which came to involve high-ranking church prelates. Bunn's term came to an end in 1947, when he was put in charge of the colleges in the Jesuits' Maryland Province. He also briefly transferred to the University of Scranton, before becoming the regent of Georgetown University's School of Dentistry and School of Nursing. In 1952, Bunn was made the president of Georgetown University. He would become the longest-serving president in the university's history to that date. One of its most pivotal presidents, he was described as the founder of \\"modern Georgetown\\". Bunn undertook an expansive building campaign, which resulted in eight new buildings, and established a large-scale, continuous, fundraising apparatus for the university. He also reformed Georgetown's organization by centralizing its administration, which had previously been carried out by its constituent schools. He improved both the quality of its academic programs and the caliber of its faculty. During his tenure, the School of Business and School of Languages and Linguistics were created out of the School of Foreign Service, which was itself significantly reorganized and named for its founder, Edmund A. Walsh. He also established what would become the School of Continuing Studies. The School of Nursing awarded baccalaureate degrees for the first time, and administration of the Georgetown University Hospital was professionalized. The law school also expanded and became known as the Georgetown University Law Center. Following the end of his presidency in 1964, Bunn remained at Georgetown as chancellor, where he continued to raise money for the university. He received numerous honorary degrees and honors from foreign governments, and the Edward B. Bunn, S.J. Intercultural Center at Georgetown was named in his honor.  Early life  alt=Facade of St. Andrew- on-Hudson Edward Bernard Bunn was born on March 15, 1896, in Baltimore, Maryland to Sebastian Philip and Filomena Philip n√©e Fortmann. He attended Loyola College in Maryland, where he received a Bachelor of Arts in 1917, and was inducted into the Phi Beta Kappa honor society. He then entered the Society of Jesus in 1919. He proceeded to the Jesuit novitiate of St. Andrew- on-Hudson in New York, where he earned a Master of Arts in English, in 1921. Immediately thereafter, Bunn began his scholasticate at Woodstock College in Maryland. His studies were punctuated by a period as professor of dramatics at Fordham University 1923 to 1926. Bunn completed his education at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, receiving a Doctor of Philosophy degree in philosophy in 1930. The title of his doctoral dissertation was \\"The Moral Judgments of Children from 6 to 12 Years of Age\\". He was ordained a priest in 1929. Following the end of his education and priestly training, Bunn became the dean of Brooklyn Preparatory School in 1930. After two years, he left to become a professor of psychology at Canisius College. Bunn remained in this position until 1935, when he transferred to Fordham as an associate professor of psychology.  Loyola College  Bunn was appointed president of Loyola College in Maryland on July 31, 1938, succeeding Joseph A. Canning. He officially assumed his duties after finishing teaching the summer term at Fordham. His inauguration on October 20 was the first time Loyola held a pompous ceremony to mark such an occasion. A significant influence on his tenure was a controversy that arose between himself and the Archbishop of Baltimore, Michael Joseph Curley. In 1937, an elderly woman, Frances Stuart, inherited a sum of money from her brother on the condition that she write her will to conform with his wishes, which specified that certain Catholic institutions, including Loyola College and the Archdiocese of Baltimore, receive bequests. In 1940, Stuart had become ill and had a lawyer that Bunn recommended draft a new will for her, which eliminated the bequests to the archdiocese and several other institutions while increasing those to Loyola and Woodstock College. She died later that year. During probate, two of her relatives filed a caveat, arguing that her second will was invalid because she was not mentally competent at the time of its creation. Archbishop Curley then entered the lawsuit, arguing Bunn had used undue influence and fraud in causing Stuart to adopt the new will. This move was highly unusual, as canon law required any Catholic suing a church official over the exercise of his ecclesial functions to bring suit in an ecclesiastical court rather than civil court. Curley declined to privately resolve the matter with Bunn or his Jesuit superiors and rejected Bunn's eventual offer to pay the archdiocese what it would have received under the original will. In 1941, several weeks before the trial, the American assistant to the Jesuit Superior General intervened by requesting Curley withdraw the suit to avoid public embarrassment for the church, in exchange for the Jesuits relinquishing their claim to the bequest entirely; Curley declined. The following month, Curley stated he would accept the offer on the condition that Bunn be removed as president of Loyola College. Meanwhile, the controversy attracted the attention of higher prelates in the church. The Apostolic Delegate to the United States informed Curley that the pope desired to have the dispute resolved out of court. Nonetheless, Curley continued the lawsuit. The Jesuit Superior General also ruled that Bunn would not be removed as president of Loyola College. The trial began in May 1941, and, after two hours of deliberation, the jury decided that Stuart's second will was valid. Following the end of the dispute with the archbishop, Bunn turned his attention to the physical growth of Loyola College. His plans for expansion, however, were initially thwarted by World War II. With the end of the war in 1945, the university saw a surge in the number of students. Therefore, Bunn aimed to construct a college chapel, but was unable to secure funding. Bunn's term as president came to an end at the close of the 1947 academic year, and he was succeeded by Francis X. Talbot.  Georgetown University  Georgetown's dental school, housed in the medical & dental building.alt=Medical & Dental Building at Georgetown University After leaving Loyola, Bunn was made the regional director of colleges and universities for the Jesuits' Maryland Province, a position he held until 1952. In 1947, he served a year as the assistant director of the labor school at the University of Scranton. Bunn became the regent of the School of Dentistry and School of Nursing at Georgetown University in 1948. During his regency, the dental school undertook an extensive renovation of its facilities and created children's and periodontal clinics and a diagnostic department. The X-ray department and orthodontic laboratory were also expanded. At the nursing school, he took the initial steps to transform the institution from a diploma-granting school to baccalaureate one. = Presidency = In October 1952, Bunn was named the president of Georgetown University, replacing J. Hunter Guthrie. He is remembered as one of the pivotal presidents in the university's history, and was described by one historian as the \\"founder of the modern Georgetown\\". Presiding over an era of post-World War II expansion, Bunn sought to establish Georgetown as the preeminent Catholic university in the United States. At the same time, he greatly increased its independence from the Jesuit superiors. His presidency was characterized by an overall centralization of the university's administration, which was previously carried out in large part by its constituent schools. One component of this was the creation of a central admissions process in 1963. He also consolidated many duplicate faculties maintained by the respective schools. Bunn also expanded and raised the caliber of the university's faculty, especially focusing on the natural sciences, philosophy, and theology. Another of Bunn's goals was to raise the academic caliber of the university. One of his first tasks was the reorganization of the School of Foreign Service (SFS). The school suffered from a lack of cohesive identity and departments that were not integrated into a single curriculum. As a result, the quality of its programs and academic caliber of its students had diminished. He also removed the Institute of Languages of Linguistics to form the School of Languages and Linguistics in 1959. Its three departments of government, economics, and history were placed under the administration of Georgetown College and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. In 1956, the School of Foreign Service was named in honor of Edmund A. Walsh, its founder, following his death that year. By 1962, the school's academic standards had improved. Women were also admitted for the first time as day students in 1953 (while they previously could enroll in the evening division). In 1964, the university created its first study-abroad program. alt=Reiss Science Building at Georgetown University With the number of SFS students studying business rapidly increasing, Bunn oversaw the separation of the Division of Business Administration to form the School of Business in 1957. The business school suffered from poor academic quality in its early years and developed a reputation among faculty and administrators as the destination of weak applicants who were unable to gain admission to Georgetown College or the SFS. Bunn even considered closing the school in 1962, but, upon the recommendation of a committee, retained it in the form of a fully independent unit of the university. In 1953, the School of Nursing completed its conversion from a diploma-granting program to a baccalaureate one. With this saw a significant increase in the number of students and an improvement in the quality of its faculty. The Nursing School, as well as Georgetown College, also admitted black students for the first time during his tenure, joining the SFS, law, and graduate schools in enrolling black students; with this, segregation of Georgetown's schools came to an end. In 1961, the Sisters of Charity of Nazareth left the Georgetown University Hospital, and Bunn took the opportunity to professionalize administration of the hospital, which had grown considerably from its early days. The School for Summer and Continuing Education, which would later become the School of Continuing Studies, was founded in 1956. Georgetown Law School also saw significant growth during Bunn's tenure, largely under the direction of its regent. The school changed its name to the Georgetown University Law Center in 1953, to reflect its new ambition. By the late 1950s, the law school's facilities had become overcrowded, and overtures were made to purchase additional land to expand. This would eventually culminate in a new building, after Bunn's presidency. Bunn oversaw a period of significant construction, resulting in the opening of eight new buildings. With the changing demographics of the Georgetown neighborhood and Washington, D.C. in general, Bunn was able to purchase numerous properties in the neighborhood to expand the eastern portion of Georgetown's campus. His building campaign ended a 20-year hiatus on construction on the campus. To support the development of new facilities, Bunn launched the Georgetown Georgetown Development Campaign. Replacing the university's previous fundraising method of relying on tuition and spontaneous gifts, he was the first president to undertake large-scale, continuous fundraising. Among the buildings constructed during his presidency were St. Mary's Hall, which was initially used as housing for the nursing students; the Walsh Building, which became the original home of the School of Foreign Service; the Reiss Science Building; and the New South and Harbin dormitories. Bunn's term as president came to an end in 1964, and he was succeeded by Gerard Campbell. At the time of his resignation, he was the longest-serving president in the university's history. = Later years = alt=Facade and square in front of the Intercultural Center After his presidency, Bunn spent the rest of his life as the chancellor of Georgetown University. In this role, he spent much of his time fundraising for the university. He also partnered with the president of American University, Hurst Robins Anderson, to create a program in which students at universities in the Washington, D.C. area could take and receive academic credit for courses in any subject at member institutions. Bunn was a member of the Washington Institute of Foreign Affairs, a trustee of the Washington Center for Metropolitan Studies, a member of the Newcomen Society in North America, a member of the board of consultants of the National War College, a trustee of the Federal City Council, and the chairman of the Committee for Inter-University Cooperation in Graduate Study. Bunn received honors from several countries. He was named a commander of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany, was awarded the grand cross of the Order of the Sun of Peru, and the Grand Gold Merit Badge of the Republic of Austria. He was the recipient of numerous honorary degrees, including Doctor of Laws degrees from Fordham University in 1938, Brandeis University in 1958, Wheeling College in 1964, and Seattle University in 1964. He also received honorary degrees from Boston College and the University of Notre Dame. Bunn died on June 18, 1972, at Georgetown University. The university created the Edward B. Bunn, S.J. Award for Faculty Excellence in 1967, whose recipient is chosen annually by the senior class. In 1982, the Edward B. Bunn, S.J. Intercultural Center at Georgetown was completed and named in his honor.

In a career that lasted from April 1819 to July 1820 he ran thirteen times, all but two of them at Newmarket and won eleven races. Both of his defeats came when he was attempting to concede weight to opponents in match races. His most important win came in May 1819 when he won the Derby. Tiresias's racing career was ended by injury in the summer of 1820, after which he was retired to stud. Background Tiresias was a brown horse standing 16 hands high bred by his owner William Bentinck, 4th Duke of Portland a leading member of the Jockey Club who owned much of the land around Newmarket Racecourse. Nicknamed \\"The Farmer Duke\\", Portland bred horses at his stately home at Welbeck Abbey in Nottinghamshire. Tiresias was sired by Soothsayer, who won the St Leger in 1811 and went on to be a successful stud horse, being the Leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland in 1819. Apart from Tiresias, his most notable winner was the 2000 Guineas winner Interpreter. He was eventually sold and exported to Russia. Tiresias was trained at Newmarket by the Duke's private trainer Richard Prince and ridden in most of his important races by the veteran jockey Bill Clift, whose strong but unsophisticated style was particularly effective on front-running horses. Racing career =1819: three-year-old season= Tirsesias was unraced as a two-year-old and began his racing career by winning five prizes in eighteen days at Newmarket in the spring of 1819. On 12 April, the opening day of the Craven meeting, Tiresias started at odds of 1/3 for a 200 guinea Sweepstakes over one mile and defeated his only rival, the Duke of Grafton's Vanguard. Three days later, his owner was able to claim a further 100 guineas without having to run his horse, when Tiresias was allowed to walk over in another Sweepstakes. Tiresias added a further 100 guineas to his earnings the following day when his opponent in a scheduled match race failed to appear. At the next meeting, Tiresias ran in the Newmarket Stakes on 30 April, in which his ten opponents included Antar, who had won the 2000 Guineas earlier in the week. He started the 4/6 favourite and won from an unnamed colt by Selim, with Antar unplaced. On the following day Tiresias started at odds of 1/3 and beat two opponents in the Palace Stakes over a mile. The performances of Tiresias led to his being made favourite for the Derby, but doubts arose after he was decisively beaten in a \\"private\\" trial by his stable companion, Snake. It was later pointed out that Tiresias, known to be an extremely difficult horse to ride, had been ridden in the trial by an inexperienced stable lad, who had been unable to control the colt effectively. On 27 May at Epsom, Tiresias started the 5/2 favourite in a field of sixteen runners for the Derby ahead of Sultan on 3/1. The race was considered exceptionally strong and there was heavy betting on the two leading contenders. Ridden by the experienced Bill Clift, he took the lead from the start and held on in the straight to win by a neck from Sultan. While some reports maintain that he beat Sultan \\"with difficulty\\", others claim that his victory was relatively easy. After completing the course Tiresias overcame Clift's restraint and galloped almost to the centre of Epsom town before he could be brought under control. After a four-month break, Tiresias returned for the three autumn meetings at Newmarket, where he was entered in five races. On 6 October he won the Newmarket St Leger, beating Banker, Sir Topaz and five others. The following day he was allowed to walk over for a Subscription Plate when none of the nineteen other entries appeared to oppose him. Tiresias was withdrawn from his engagement in the Oatlands Stakes on 22 October at a meeting disrupted by snow. Tiresias's winning run came to an end on the opening day of the Houghton meeting on 1 November. He was beaten in a one mile match race by Mr Vansittart's grey colt Financier, to whom he was attempting to concede three pounds. Tiresias ended his season with a win four days later when he beat the four-year-old Dictator in the Audley End Stakes. =1821: four-year-old season= Tiresias began his four-year-old campaign with a match race against Merlin at Newmarket on 6 April. He took the 300 guinea prize without effort as his opponent broke down injured a quarter of a mile from the finish. At the next Newmarket meeting two weeks later he claimed another 300 guinea prize, recording a \\"very easy\\" win over Pacha in a one mile match. Three days later he was beaten into second place when attempting to concede eight pounds to Banker in a Sweepstakes. On 4 May at Newmarket, Tiresias won the Jockey Club Purse over the four mile Beacon Course, easily beating Aldford at level weights. On 4 July, Tiresias traveled away from Newmarket for only the second time in his career when he contested the two mile King's Purse at Ipswich. The race was run in a series of heats, the prize going to the first horse to win two of these. Tiresias settled the race by winning the first two heats, beating his three-year-old opponents. A week later, on his final appearance, Tirseias walked over for a ¬£50 prize at Newmarket's July meeting. He was injured shortly afterwards and retired from racing. Stud career Tiresias was retired to his owner's stud at Norton, near Ollerton in Nottinghamshire. His initial stud fee was 10 guineas with half a guinea for the groom. He was not considered a success as a stallion, with his offspring being described as \\"big and good looking, but very uncertain customers\\", suggesting that he transmitted a good deal of his difficult temperament. His name did not appear in the List of Stallions advertised in the Racing Calendar after 1831, suggesting that he had been withdrawn from stud duties. Tiresias died at his owner's estate at Welbeck Abbey on 4 November 1837.

A self-described \\"shoe leather reporter,\\" Methvin contributed more than 100 articles to Reader's Digest and its 48 editions, reaching more than 100 million readers worldwide. His articles covered topics ranging from the U.S. Supreme Court, civil liberties and constitutional law, to U.S. defense posture, Kremlin politics, U.S.-Soviet relations, organized crime and international terrorist groups. An article by Methvin in the January 1965 Reader's Digest, \\"How the Reds Make a Riot,\\" won the magazine the coveted award for public service in magazine journalism given annually by the Society for Professional Journalists. Methvin's work on communism, crime and corruption earned him not only the respect of his peers, but influence in government. His articles in Reader's Digest helped rally necessary support for legislation that would go on to become law and, in 1983, he was appointed by President Ronald Reagan to the President's Commission on Organized Crime. Methvin supervised the commission's investigation and hearing on labor- management racketeering. Marvin Wolfgang, past president and fellow of the American Society of Criminology, wrote of Methvin, \\"No journalist or reporter knows more about criminology.\\" Along with his work with Reader's Digest, Methvin also authored two books: The Riot Makers: The Technology of Social Demolition, 1970, and The Rise of Radicalism: The Social Psychology of Messianic Extremism, 1973. In 1995, the Washington, D.C. chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists named Methvin to its \\"Hall of Fame\\" for \\"exemplary professional achievements, outstanding service to other members of the profession and lifelong dedication to the highest standards of journalism.\\" Early life Methvin was born in Vienna, Georgia to Claude M. Methvin, Jr. and Madge Hilburn Methvin, editors and publishers of a local paper, The Vienna News. Methvin began his journalism education by sleeping on a bale of newsprint every Thursday night while his parents met the weekly deadline. At the age of four, he got into a bucket of ink behind the family's flatbed cylinder press, and not even a gasoline bath could get all the printer's ink out of him. He started as a reporter (leg man only) before he could write, for at the age of five he would wander around the streets of his home town with pad and pencil asking residents to write down their news for him. Vienna, with a population of 2000, was a two-newspaper town in those days, chiefly as a result of his father's differences with a number of courthouse officials over a lynching, expressed in front-page editorials. Once while covering his beat, young Methvin encountered an assembly of grownups in one store gathered around the cracker barrel, and they offered a number of humorous quotes about the alleged superiorities of the opposition newspaper. Reporter Methvin promptly provided editorial comment: \\"Y'all are just a bunch of old damn fools,\\" he declared. Whereupon he looked up and saw the town's Baptist preacher standing in the circle, so he quickly amended his copy: \\"All 'cep you, 'cause you work in the church-house,\\" he said. Which, the preacher later declared from the pulpit, proved the youngster would make a good editor \\"because he knows who to call a damn fool and who to let alone.\\" Growing up in Vienna in the 1930s and 1940s had a major impact on Methvin‚Äôs work throughout his life. Methvin‚Äôs parents published The Vienna News, known for its opposition to Jim Crow laws. Methvin‚Äôs parents received death threats from Ku Klux Klan members for their views. In his later years he would recall that, \\"as a young man I considered myself a liberal, because I was against lynching. When I got to Washington, to my surprise, I learned I was a conservative.\\" Methvin studied journalism at the University of Georgia School of Journalism. On campus he served as a member of the debate team and was a four-year letterman on UGA's football team under legendary coach, Wallace Butts. He belonged to Sigma Nu fraternity, and the Society of Professional Journalists, Sigma Delta Chi, which named him the outstanding male graduate of 1955. He was also a member of Phi Beta Kappa, and worked briefly as a reporter on the Atlanta Constitution. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Journalism degree, cum laude, with a supplementary major and postgraduate study in law at the University of Georgia School of Law. As a journalism student, Methvin admired the works of H.L. Menken, doing a class project on Menken's The American Mercury After college, he enlisted in the U.S. Air Force. Methvin would spend three years as a jet fighter pilot flying the F-86 and F-102 all- weather interceptors. Journalism career In 1958 he joined the Washington Daily News as a general assignment reporter. He did graduate study in philosophy and international relations at the Youngstown, American and George Washington Universities. In 1960 he joined the Reader's Digest Washington bureau, and served as associate editor and senior editor until 1996. He then retired from full-time staff and became a contributing editor until February 2002 when he ended his 42-year career with the magazine. Methvin had a special interest for stories involving crime, corruption and the Cold War. Among Methvin's favorite targets was labor unions. ‚ÄúI consider myself fortunate to have been allowed to play the piccolo in the great parade of American democracy for nearly half a century,‚Äù Methvin wrote before his death. ‚ÄúDuring that time, the American people defeated and brought down two evil empires: the Teamsters Union and the Soviet Union, and I and my piccolo had a hand in both. That is enough for me.‚Äù Methvin was the prime author of a series of hard- hitting Reader's Digest articles in 1970-72 that played a key role in shaping the federal government's war on organized crime. The proposed Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, including the famous \\"RICO\\" statute, was snugly corked in committee in Congress, and Chairman Emanuel Celler (D., N.Y.) of the House Judiciary Committee was determined to kill it there. But so much mail poured in to Congress as a result of two Methvin articles (\\"How the Mafia Preys on the Poor,\\" September '70; and \\"The Mafia War on the A&P;,\\" July '70) that a discharged petition forced Celler to bring the legislation to the floor for a vote. \\"I've got to get that blankety-blank Reader's Digest off my back,\\" he grumbled. When the bill passed overwhelmingly, 341 to 26, Sen. John McClellan, its chief architect, expressed his thanks to Methvin for his \\"especially significant contribution to the passage of this measure.\\" And Attorney General John N. Mitchell sent him a pen used by President Richard Nixon to sign the bill, expressing the Administration's gratitude \\"for the part you played in bringing this important crime legislation into being.\\" Ironically, three years later it was this law's limited testimonial immunity provision that enabled the Senate Watergate Committee to compel White House Counsel John Dean to testify, leading ultimately to Mitchell's subsequent imprisonment and President Nixon's resignation. Methvin and the Digest were sued for $4 million by an organized crime figure named in one of his articles. After he presented his documentation and deposition on his investigation, a New York State judge dismissed the suit, declaring, \\"Documentation supplied by defendants showed they acted responsibly in extensively investigating all aspects of the story, which was imbued with legitimate public concern.\\" Methvin declared he would have been happy to have the judge's ruling engraved on his tombstone. Methvin also tackled the \\"religion\\" of Scientology in a 1980 article titled, \\"Scientology: Anatomy of a Frightening Cult\\". His \\"swan song\\" was a July 2001 article about a rank-and-file crusader who helped break the back of a corrupt racketeering organization in the New York City employes union, American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employes Union District Council 37. Personal life In 1959 Methvin married Barbara Lester of Byromville, Georgia, and the couple had two daughters, Helen and Claudia. Barbara was killed on March 31, 2000, by a speeding car as she crossed the road in front of their home. In 2011, he established the Methvin Distinguished Professorship in Southern Literature at the University of Georgia in her honor.

The club fields both Gaelic football and hurling teams. It is a member of the Avondhu division of Cork GAA. History The club has been in existence since the 1880s. The club has been primarily a hurling club, but it has played Gaelic football also, though with less success. Records indicate that there was a senior football team in Shanballymore in 1894 but all traces of a team was lost up to the 1940s when a team called Brian Boru's was fielded. The club was reformed in 1958 and played with little success until 1980 when we won the Avondhu Junior B double ‚Äì championship and league,. Two members of that winning side Connor Hannon and Tom Mannix won All-Ireland Minor Football Championship medals with Cork GAA in 1981. In the early 80s Shanballymore fielded a very strong Junior football outfit and were unlucky to lose to Kilshannig three years on the trot by very narrow margins. The football club merged with Doneraile in 1984. In 1985 they were back in B grade against and reached the finals in 1986, 1987, and 1988 ‚Äì only to lose in all three. The club persevered and in 1989, it won the Junior B Football championship, defeating Kilworth and were upgraded to Junior A ranks for the early 1990s. In 2011 Shanballymore won the Junior B Football championship for the first time in 22 years defeating Grange on a scoreline of 1-03 to 0-10. The hurling history begins in 1902, when the club contested the Cork Senior Hurling Championship final, losing to Dungourney. In 1942 the junior North Cork and County titles were annexed to be followed by the Cork Intermediate Hurling Championship crown in 1943. The 1948 and 1959 County Intermediate finals were to see a reversal of fortunes as they went under to East Cork Sides, Midleton and Carrigtwohill. 1951 Saw Shanballymore getting revenge on Midleton in another Cork Intermediate Hurling Championship final victory. Shanballymore were back in Senior ranks in 1952 and continued there until 1956 ‚Äì returning to Intermediate up to 1959. The club then went into decline, with the next success being in winning the Junior B (or novice as it then was) in 1965. In 1979 the Under-16 hurlers won divisional and county honours heralding a revival ‚Äì to be followed in 1981 with the Minor crown ‚Äì but losing the Under-21 finals to Ballyhea in 1983 and 1984. It took until 1996 for our next hurling success winning the North Cork Junior A Hurling Championship this title was regained in 1997 to win back to back championships. This is the club's last hurling championship success to date in the Junior A grade. However, The Junior B hurling championship of 2016 was a proud year for Shanballymore as they won the Cork Junior B Hurling Championship for the first time and this was further rewarded by winning the All-Ireland Junior B Club Hurling Championship.

This was the first time ever that a NATO summit was held in the United States outside of the nation's capital, Washington, D.C. The event was originally scheduled to coincide and be held after the 2012 G8 summit in Chicago as well, but the G8 summit was later rescheduled to be held at Camp David.Mack, Kristen et al. \\"Chicago to host NATO, G-8 next year,\\" Chicago Tribune (US). 22 June 2011; \\"Administration official: Obama to bring NATO, G8 summits in hometown of Chicago in 2012,\\" The Washington Post (US). 22 June 2011. Retrieved 22 June 2011 Agenda NATO leaders The previous summit was the 2010 summit in Lisbon, Portugal. The summit in Chicago discussed the impact of recent events since then, such as the Arab Spring, Libyan Civil War, as well as the global financial crisis, and transition for NATO forces in Afghanistan, and a missile shield system for Europe to seek routes out.NATO to endorse Afghan exit plan, seeks routes out =Middle East= NATO is planning to craft specific resolutions concerning the Middle East. Issues to address include the organization's continuing military support of active insurrections in the region, as well conflict with Iran. The group is going to make plans for defending certain areas, such as the Strait of Hormuz. =Nuclear weapons= NATO will also discuss missile defense and nuclear deterrence more generally. NATO's secretary general Rasmussen has confirmed plans to proceed with ballistic missile defense, a system that would alter the longstanding balance of mutually assured destruction between the United States and Russia, but yet protect NATO-member nations from missile attacks from nations such as Iran or North Korea. Many years prior, NATO member the United States had informed Russia on several occasions that if Russia didn't limit its cooperation with the Iranian missile program, the defense shield would be necessary. Rasmussen announced that a successful test had been conducted in April 2012 of the missile defense system, and that further details about existing \\"interim capability\\" would be announced at the Chicago summit. This position has been changed since the Lisbon Summit, during which NATO powers ordered the creation of a \\"Deterrence and Defense Posture Review\\" (DDPR)‚Äîa document expected to express and discuss conflicts some of the wide-ranging conflicts on the topic within NATO. The United States is also planning to upgrade 180 tactical nuclear weapons currently positioned in Europe. The upgrade would improve guidance systems on the missiles, rendering them able to hit targets more precisely. Russia has requested that the NATO countries declare \\"adherence to the rules of international law\\" in the nuclear policy they agree upon at the Chicago summit. Russia has also announced that it may retaliate against the deployment of NATO's defense system by using Iskander theater ballistic missile weapons or by striking weapons sites in Europe, although experts believe Russia will not risk war with the United States and its NATO allies by attacking such targets. =Russia= Russia worries that its own nuclear arsenal could be rendered useless with the full activation of a missile shield by the United States. Russia's nuclear deterrent maintains a 'strategic balance' between the two major powers. But the United States insists that a defense system is necessary to mitigate any threat from Iran. In previous years, Russia had been invited on several occasions to work with NATO on defense systems, but declined. The organization also plans to review its collective relationship to Russia. Indeed, NATO has stated that Russia's attendance at the Chicago event will depend upon accession to a system of European missile defense. =Afghanistan war= NATO command in Kabul The Afghanistan issue in particular faces a public relations timeline due to a declaration by Barack Obama that NATO activities in Afghanistan would be concluded by 2014, but 28-nation military bloc was clearly divided, as the new French President, Francois Hollande, indicated that he will pull out all 3,400 French troops at the end of 2012 or 2 years ahead of NATO's timetable. Main topics and results =Afghanistan war= The leaders of the NATO-member countries endorsed on 21 May 2012 an exit strategy for the War in Afghanistan and declared their long-term commitment to Afghanistan. The NATO-led ISAF forces will hand over command of all combat missions to Afghan forces by the middle of 2013, while shifting at the same time from combat to a support role of advising, training and assisting the Afghan security forces and then withdraw most of the 130,000 foreign troops by the end of December 2014. A new and different NATO mission will then advise, train and assist the Afghan security forces including the Afghan Special Operations Forces. The pace of withdrawal will be determined by each country individually, but coordinated with coalition planners. According to a Western official, nations with troops in Afghanistan pledged roughly $1 billion to fund Afghan security forces after 2014, while the majority of the funding will come from the United States. This was confirmed by a report of the Los Angeles Times which stated that according to British Prime Minister David Cameron, Australia, Denmark, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Estonia and others had made pledges that added \\"almost\\" $1 billion. However, these figures changed later as in June 2012 news media like The Globe and Mail, The Herald Sun, Al Jazeera English, The Washington Post, Shanghai Daily and BBC News Online published that at the NATO Chicago summit an annual aid of 4.1 billion U.S. dollars was pledged to pay for ongoing training, equipment and financial support for Afghanistan's security forces after 2014. =Smart Defense= As consequence of shrinking defense budgets the NATO leaders agreed to share the costs of weapons and equipment as part of a so-called \\"Smart Defense\\" initiative. The NATO leaders approved 20 projects for this initiative. These projects cover the funding for remotely controlled robots used to clear roads of homemade bombs or mines, the creation of a pool of maritime patrol planes from a number of nations, the creation of a joint management of munitions for buying and storage of munitions, maintenance of armored vehicles, sharing of medical facilities, common management of fuel handling, cooperation in the use of surveillance aircraft with joint training for intelligence specialists and purchase of Global Hawk surveillance drones operated by NATO in the name of all its member states. \\"Together, we will keep NATO capable of responding to the security challenges of tomorrow, because no country, no continent can deal with them alone,\\" Secretary General of NATO Anders Fogh Rasmussen told the leaders ahead of the discussion about budget cuts. \\"We can find common solutions to common problems.\\" Rasmussen explained the reason behind the \\"Smart Defense\\" initiative is that the military must do more with less in a time of budget cuts due to NATO members need to save money in the time of the Great Recession. Anders Fogh Rasmussen's \\"Smart Defense\\" initiative, which advocates \\"pooling and sharing resources, setting better priorities and encouraging countries to specialize in things they are best at,\\" was inspired after the remarks made by U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates in June 2011, who stated that NATO faced \\"the real possibility [of] a dim, if not dismal future\\" because of chronically underfunded defense apparatuses in Europe. Only four European countries‚ÄîGreat Britain, France, Albania, and Greece‚Äîhave committed to the alliance's agreed benchmark of committing two percent of their GDP to defense. The United States, which contributes three-quarters to NATO's operating budget, is experiencing severe budgetary problems while simultaneously re-balancing military commitments to the Pacific, further straining the Atlantic alliance. \\"Current projections show the U.S. defense budget shrinking by $487 billion in the decade to come, with another half trillion in cuts possible depending on the outcome of the highly partisan negotiations over future reductions to the federal deficit.\\" Smart Defense is intended to make Europe more responsible for European security and the European periphery as the United States military withdraws from the continent. NATO's Libya operation may be a model for such engagement: \\"The United States will do what it must‚Äîplaying roles and providing surge capabilities that only it can provide‚Äîand Europe will bear the rest of the burden for operations that are more in its own interests than those of the United States.\\" Because Europe is not experiencing an existential threat like it did during the Cold War, the preponderance of U.S. assets for military campaigns that do not fall under Article 5 will diminish. Skepticism of Smart Defense is plenty. Francois Heisburg, chairman of The International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) and of the Geneva Centre for Security Policy says that governments typically choose \\"jobs in defense companies at home over [the] military logic\\" of pooling resources. Former Ambassador to NATO and Professor at Harvard Kennedy School, R. Nicholas Burns recognizes the structural troubles facing NATO but is nonetheless optimistic, stating \\"Investment in an alliance that in large measure denationalizes defense, and contains or resolves old antagonism through family arguments around NATO's kitchen table, provides a remarkable rate of return.\\" =Missile defence= During the 2010 Lisbon summit NATO members agreed to establish a missile defense system that would have the capability of covering all member states in Europe, as well as the United States and Canada. In Chicago NATO leaders declared that this system has reached interim capability. Interim capability means that a basic command and control capability has been tested and installed at NATO's Headquarters Allied Air Command in Ramstein, Germany, while NATO Allies provide sensors and interceptors to connect to the system. It also means that US ships with anti-missile interceptors in the Mediterranean Sea and a Turkey-based radar system have been put under NATO command in the German base. \\"Our system will link together missile defence assets from different Allies ‚Äì satellites, ships, radars and interceptors ‚Äì under NATO command and control. It will allow us to defend against threats from outside the Euro-Atlantic area\\", NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said. The NATO missile defense system was expected to have limited capability by 2015 and to be fully operational by 2018. NATO's long-term goal is to merge missile defence assets provided by individual allies into a coherent defence system so that full coverage and protection for all NATO European populations, territory and forces against the threats posed by proliferation of ballistic missiles is ensured. This goal is expected to be realised sometime between the end of the 2010s and the beginning of the 2020s. To this end Spain will host four US Aegis warships at its port in Rota while Poland and Romania have agreed to host US land-based SM-3 missiles in the coming years. Protests Amateur video of protest, 20 May 2012 Several thousand protestors marched through downtown Chicago until they reached as close as they could to the buildings where the NATO leaders were meeting.http://www.cbsnews.com/news/1000s-protest-the-chicago-nato-summit/ There, in a historic throwback to Vietnam War protesters, 50 members of Iraq Veterans Against the War threw medals they had received during missions in Afghanistan and Iraq in a symbol of resistance and denunciation. Each veteran expressed their reasons for leaving the army and their experiences in the wars as they hurled their medals in the direction of where the summit was taking place.http://www.democracynow.org/2012/5/21/no_nato_no_war_us_veterans Representing the voices of the Afghan civilians impacted by the war, Samira Sayed-Rahman, Suraia Sahar and Sabz Maher of Afghans for Peace attended the week of actions and spoke to the crowd following the veterans ceremony.http://www.cbc.ca/player/Embedded- Only/News/ID/2237220791/http://socialistworker.org/2012/06/19/resistance-to- the-endless-war The three women are Toronto and U.S. based-activists who consulted with organizers during the planning of the protests and collaborated with the soldiers and veterans on how best to conduct the medal ceremony so as to respect the victims of the wars.http://www.ivaw.org/blog/ivaw-action- featured-afghans-peace-home-page Planners expected the NATO summit to draw protesters from the Occupy movement, as well as the anti-globalization movement, and many protesters from around the world. Some parochial schools -only those near the downtown meeting site- had considered closing for the event. However, no Chicago Public Schools closed for the event -not even those near the downtown site. =Citizen journalism= A range of groups were in the city for an organize citizen journalism centers to provide independent media coverage of the summit. Alderman Rick Munoz has proposed legislation for the City Council that prohibits police from interfering with online media and cell phones during the event. However, that legislation was not passed. Security =Police forces= Chicago mounted police, 2010 The summit was designated a National Special Security Event (NSSE) by the Department of Homeland Security. Final authority over law enforcement thus belonged to the Secret Service of the United States. The NSSE steering committee, which also included representatives from the Chicago Police Department and has 24 subcommittees, began meeting in October 2011. Local security forces were trained by an Illinois company, Controlled F.O.R.C.E., which specializes in subduing crowds if necessary. Police are being trained in \\"Mechanical Advantage Control Holds\\", as well as the use of tasers. The city signed a $193,461 contract for the procurement of new face shields that fit over gas masks; the shields were intended to protect police officers from liquids. The Chicago Police Department also prepared its mounted unit with riot gear: armor for horses along with \\"crowd control training\\". =New Chicago rules= Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel proposed and passed new ordinances. These ordinances are permanent, remaining in effect after the summits are over. The new measures include: * Authorization for the mayor to purchase and deploy surveillance cameras throughout the city. * Restrictions on public activity, including amplified sound and morning gatherings. * Restrictions on parades, including the requirement to purchase an insurance policy worth $1 million and to register every sign or banner that will be held by more than one person. * Allow the Chicago Police Superintendent to deputize many different types of law enforcement personnel other than the Chicago Police Department if this becomes necessary. These new ordinances drew protests from the ACLU, Amnesty International, and the Occupy Movement (particularly Occupy Chicago). Some local business owners have asked for more retail security during the summit. =HR 347= HR 347, a federal law also known as the Federal Restricted Buildings and Grounds Improvement Act, was also modified at this time‚Äîessentially a Washington, DC update on an already existing law. The law already protected those under the Secret Service's protection, except in Washington, DC where these protections fell under the local law for trespassing. The Secret Service requested the change because it was not a federal violation to jump the White House fence and run across the lawn, but the modification now makes it a federal violation. Mara Verheyden-Hilliard, executive director of the Partnership for Civil Justice Fund, contends the modification can somehow be used against protesters and has argued that this law only plays a small part in a larger campaign against free speech. Summit costs The city of Chicago presented on 29 June 2012 a bill for nearly $15.6 million in expenses for the May NATO summit ‚Äì in part to one of its own agencies ‚Äì and said more bills are coming. In a series of letters, the city formally requested that units of the state and federal governments and World Business Chicago, the public/private group that served as the summit host committee, reimburse it for $15,578,267.33 in expenses. Almost all of that was for the police department, which wracked up millions of dollars in overtime, training and related costs. The city seeks payment of $14.6 million for police services. The remainder of the bill, a little less than $1 million, is for fire department services. Sarah Hamilton, Mayor Rahm Emanuel's communications director, described the bill as \\"our first reimbursement request,\\" with more to come. \\"We will make others and plan to have all reimbursements submitted within the month,\\" she said in an email, but added that the 29 June bill represent most of what eventually will be requested.

Biography David Dippie Dixon was born in Whittingham, Northumberland, on 1 September 1842 to parents William and Jane Dixon, and christened there on 23 October 1842. Although his middle name is sometimes assumed to be a pejorative nickname, it was actually the maiden name of his paternal grandmother, Margaret Dippee. He was brought up in WhittinghamUK Census, 1861 (RG9) piece:3894, folio:53 page:1 and was educated at the local village school, which he left at the age of 13 to become apprentice in his father's drapery and grocery shop in the village. In 1862, his father opened a second shop in Coquetdale House, on the High Street in Rothbury (about 6 miles south of Whittingham). David entered into a legal partnership with his father and moved to set up the new store under the name of \\"Dixon & Sons\\". In Rothbury he met Mary Hindhaugh, and married in 1869. Mary was the daughter of Robert Hindhaugh, who ran the local brewery and was part of a \\"large and influential family ... since at least the seventeenth century\\". After they were married, they lived \\"above the store\\" in Coquetdale House.UK Census, 1881 (RG11) piece:5137, folio:86 page:4UK Census, 1891 (RG12) piece:4272, folio:73 page:21UK Census, 1901 (RG13) piece:4851, folio:7 page:5 But David did not just work as a grocer and draper. He was fascinated by the history of the area, and was an avid researcher of and writer on local history. Apart from numerous articles, he wrote two significant books on the area's history (see below). According to John Roland Bibby in the foreword to a facsimile version of the latter of these books, David edited the local parish magazine and contributed to The Newcastle Society of Antiquities with his writings and artefacts that he had been given. He was a Church Warden, a Sunday School teacher, co-founder of the Rothbury Company of Volunteers, a member of the local Red Cross Society, a guide for visitors to Coquetdale, and a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. David and Mary's only child, William Robert Dixon, was born 12 June 1870 and a few weeks later, on 1 July, David and his father dissolved their partnership in favour of a new partnership with his brother, John Turnbull Dixon. They renamed the store \\"Dixon Brothers\\" which, as well as being a general draper and family grocer, became a tea dealer, stationer, bookseller and newsagent. Some years later, David's son set up business next door, before eventually emigrating to Australia. In 1911 the store ran into financial problems and the business was handed over to the auditors. David continued to manage the store, but he and his wife were obliged to find somewhere else to live. Fortunately, he was offered a farm cottage at the nearby Cragside Estate by Lord Armstrong, rent free for a year. Eventually, the store went out of business and David retired. However, Lord Armstrong gave him a job at Cragside as librarian, and he continued to live out his days at the cottage on the estate. His wife, Mary, died in 1918 at the age of 71. David Dippie Dixon died on 28 November 1929 and his estate was valued at only ¬£261 11s 3d (the spending equivalent of ¬£13,500 in 2013).Dixon, David Dippie - England & Wales, National Probate Calendar (Index of Wills and Administrations, 1858-1966 (ancestry.co.uk) David and Mary are buried in the cemetery in Rothbury. Coquetdale House itself still exists on Rothbury High Street, and the shops are now the Vale Tea Rooms and part of the Rothbury Co- Op. Writings As an amateur historian, David Dippie Dixon spent many hours reading about and exploring the local area, and writing about his findings, whether they be nature, folk lore or the picturesque views. As a result of his time in Whittingham, his first major work was Whittingham Vale: its History, Traditions, and Folk-Lore published in 1895. Eight years later he published what is probably his most well-known work, Upper Coquetdale, Northumberland: its History Traditions, Folk Lore and Scenery in which he explores and records the history, wildlife and culture of Upper Coquetdale (the valley of the River Coquet). In his introduction, Dixon asks the reader to \\"remember that it has been the leisure-hour employment of two village tradesmen\\". This book tells of local life including the annual Shrowe-tide (Shrove Tuesday) Football (using the term loosely) match as \\"In Rothbury, the custom of football-play on Shrove Tuesday had been observed from time immemorial until the year 1867. The hale (goal) of the Thropton men was the bridge over the Wreigh at Thropton.\\" Illustrations for the book were drawn by his brother and business partner, John Turnbull Dixon, who married Jane Ann Hindhaugh, Mary's sister. Both books are significant histories of the area, and original copies are rare and sought after. As a result, Frank Graham publishers produced facsimile copies in the 1970s. The first was Upper Coquetdale in 1974, with a foreword by John Roland Bibby, and the facsimile copy of Whittingham Vale was published in 1979. In more recent years, a number of reprints have become available and both remain fascinating and detailed accounts of the history of the area. In 2006, Paul Frodsham published \\"An introduction to Prehistoric Upper Coquetdale, 100 Years after David Dippie Dixon\\". Originally intended as an updated account of the archaeology, the natural environment and the social history of the upper Coquet valley, the book ended up covering only the pre-Roman archaeology. Nevertheless, it was also an homage to the man who captured the spirit of one of the most beautiful and remote areas of England. References External links * A photograph of D. D.

It is being developed by GlaxoSmithKline for the treatment of preterm labour. Retosiban has high affinity for the oxytocin receptor (Ki = 0.65 nM) and has greater than 1400-fold selectivity over the related vasopressin receptors Mechanism of action Retosiban is a competitive oxytocin receptor antagonist which blocks the oxytocin-mediated contraction of the uterine smooth muscle in the female uterus that occurs during the initiation of preterm labour. This has been used to prevent preterm labour and premature birth. Pharmacology Retosiban has been shown to be an effective tocolytic. By intravenous and oral administration it produces a dose-dependent decrease in oxytocin-induced uterine contractions in non- pregnant female rats. In late-term pregnant rats it significantly reduces spontaneous uterine contractions in a dose-dependent manner by intravenous administration. In humans retosiban prolongs pregnancy and reduces preterm birth. Intravenous administration of retosiban in women with spontaneous preterm labour was associated with a greater than 1-week increase in time to delivery compared with placebo, a significant reduction in preterm deliveries, a non-significant increase in uterine quiescence, and a favourable safety profile. The results demonstrate proof-of-concept in the treatment of threatened spontaneous preterm labour Pharmacokinetics The oral bioavailability of retosiban is in the order of 100% in the rat with a half life of 1.4 hours. It has low to moderate intrinsic clearance in microsomes from three pre-clinical species (rat, dog, cynomolgus monkey) and low intrinsic clearance in human microsomes. It has a good cytochrome P450 (Cyp450) profile with no significant inhibition, with IC50 > 100ŒºM, low protein binding (<80%) and low predicted CNS penetration.  Physical and chemical properties At physiological pH, retosiban exists in an uncharged state. It has good solubility (> 0.22 mg/ml), with a logd of 2.2. Numbered structure of retosiban, showing the 2,5-diketopiperazine pharmacophore required for good activity (in red) and the required (3R, 6R, 7R)-stereochemistry for optimal potency Retosiban consists of a central 2,5 diketopiperazine ring with an R-indanyl group at the 3 position and an R (S-secButyl) at the 6 position, both cis to each other, and with a R-2-methyl oxazole ring at the 7 position in the acyclic amide attached to the N1-position. Retosiban is the (3R, 6R, 7R)-isomer and is a sub-nanomolar (Ki = 0.65 nM) oxytocin receptor antagonist, while the (3R, 6R, 7S)-isomer where the stereochemistry in the amide side-chain at C-7 is inverted, is 10-fold less potent. Typically in this series of 2,5 diketopiperazine oxytocin antagonists the (3S, 6S, 7S) isomer is >500 less active than the (3R, 6R, 7R)-isomer. In addition to the 2,5 diketopiperazine essential core, retosiban also contains several structural characteristics that improve its effectiveness and safety. An indanyl group at position 3 is the best choice in terms of oxytocin receptor antagonist potency, its replacement by phenethyl and benzyl groups led to a progressive weakening of activity. At C-3, a 4-carbon branched alkyl was shown to be preferred with R (S-secButyl) being the best; smaller alkyl groups result in reduced antagonist activity. The 2-methyl oxazole ring at the 7 position gives good aqueous solubility, low protein binding and minimal Cyp450 interaction. This structure‚Äìactivity relationship (SAR) is supported by the crystal structure of the human oxytocin receptor in complex with retosiban, where the lipophilic indanyl substituent penetrates into a deep, mainly hydrophobic crevice at the bottom of the binding pocket, while the oxazol-morpholine amide moiety is closest to the extracellular surface. The oxazole ring is the most solvent-exposed substituent, and the morpholine ring has no direct interactions with the receptor. The 2,5-diketopiperazine core specifically interacts with the receptor through a polar interaction interface.  Synthesis Retosiban is a cyclic dipeptide or 2,5-diketopiperazine and these are formed by cyclising the corresponding linear dipeptide. In the short lab-scale and highly stereoselective synthesis of Retosiban 8 the linear peptide 5 is formed by the four-component Ugi reaction of the carboxybenzyl (Cbz) protected R-indanylglycine 1, D-alloisoleucine methyl ester hydrochloride 2, 2-methyloxazole-4-carboxaldehyde 3 and 2-benzyloxyphenylisonitrile 4. Hydrogenation to remove the Cbz and benzyl protecting groups, enabled cyclization of the linear peptide 5 to occur to give the phenolic cyclic dipeptide 6. Hydrolysis of the phenolic amide, by reaction with carbonyl diimidazole (CDI), followed addition of aqueous hydrochloric acid gave the acid 7 which was converted to the amide Retosiban 8 by activating the acid with the peptide coupling reagent PyBOP (benzotriazol-1-yloxytripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate) followed by the addition of morpholine. Although the linear peptide 5 and the cyclic dipeptide 6 are a mixture of diastereoisomers (7RS) at the exocyclic amide, the hydrochloric acid hydrolysis of the activated phenolic amide caused epimerisation at the exocyclic position and yielded the acid 7 with the required (7R)-stereochemistry as the major product. A synthetic scheme for the production of Retosiban via the Ugi reaction.

In 1783, the ruler of Orchha Vikramajit (1776‚Äì1817) shifted his capital from Orchha to Tehri and renamed it Tikamgarh, which is in the vicinity of Papora. An inscription of Vikrama 1840 (AD 1784) suggests that the site then had emerged as a tirtha. Motilal Varni (an associate of Ganesh Varni), had established a religious schoolMeri Jivan Gatha, Ganeshprasad Varni, 1949, Shri Ganeshprasad Varni Jain Granthmala, Varanasi, p. 360, 546 which has produced several distinguished scholars like Darbari Lal Kothia.Papaura Darshan, Pt. Vimal Kumar Shastri, Shri Digambar jain Atishya Kshetra Papaura ji, Tikamgarh, 2014, p. IX He had donated his own collection of handwritten manuscripts to the school. Architecture The oldest temples mainly from 18th and 19th century, are in the part termed Prachina Samucchaya, which includes two underground chambers (bhoyras) from the 12th century. In 1860 AD, a unique cluster of 24 temples was constructed. At the same time the chariot-shaped temple that serves as the grand entrance gate was constructed. A number of temples were constructed in 1965. Many temples have notable old and modern wall paintings. Temple construction has gradually continues, with a circular Bahubali temple being among the recent ones. Prayers and worship take place in the temple basement and in Chandraprabhu Mandir, with an idol dated samvat 1524 that is regarded to be helpful in materializing the desires of pilgrims. The temple of Lord Parshvanath contains a unique image of Padmavati devi. In addition to the 108 temples, there exists a school and a library founded by Motilal Varni, an Udasina Ashrama and a hostel for the students. Four dharmashalas, a rest house and a dining hall is also in the tirth kshetra compound. Atishaya ‚Äì Here exists an ancient little pond. It is said that when pilgrims dropped a paper listing of required utensils in this pond, the utensils were received from the pond and used by the pilgrims. After use and cleaning, these utensils were returned to the pond and utensils thus disappeared back into the water. This miracle is not seen nowadays because one person did not return the utensils received from the pond.Bharat Ke Digambar Jain Tirth, Pt. 3, Balbhadra Jain, Bharatvarshiya Digambar Jain Tirthkshetra Committee, Bharatiya Janapitha, 1976, p. 105-116 Here is a well known as ‚ÄòPatrakhan Well‚Äô. It is said that an old woman organized a party on the completion of a big temple (Temple No.-1) in samvat 1872. Suddenly the water of the well was finished and lack of water for guests was felt. Then that old women entered the well and reached the bottom. Then as she started her heartfelt prayers, water began flowing in the well and as the old woman was lifted from the well, the level of water also increased simultaneously. Thus the honor of that old sacred woman was kept. This well still exists near the mess of school here.

Hi Gang. A sequel to this domestic sitcom, Life with the Lyons, debuted on BBC radio and television in November 1950.Audio Archive, Life with the Lyons 22 Eps. History Hi Gang! was conceived as an idea by Ben Lyon at the beginning of World War 2, when he and his wife Bebe Daniels were travelling around Britain appearing in entertainment shows at theatres, army camps and factories. They thought of asking the BBC for a light comedy programme, which would reach many more people at the same time, as part of the effort to raise morale. The idea was accepted by Pat Hillyard, head of BBC Light Entertainment. Vic Oliver agreed to join them. Most of the dialogue was written by Bebe, and she introduced a new song into the show every week.Allgood, p.132 Music was provided by Jay Wilbur and his Orchestra. The show made fun of Hitler and the fascist Irish-German anti-British propagandist 'Lord Haw-Haw'.Allgood, p.130 The first broadcast of Hi Gang! was on 26 May 1940, coincident with the start of the Dunkirk evacuation. It ran weekly for one year, and until 1949. The production never left London, starting at Maida Vale Studios, moving to St. George's Hall and ending up at the underground Paris Theatre.Allgood, p.131 Stars such as Jack Buchanan, Sarah Churchill, No√´l Coward, Florence Desmond, Geraldo, Carroll Gibbons, John Gielgud, Robertson Hare, Stanley Holloway, Michael Redgrave and Jack Warner appeared as guests in Hi Gang!. Ronald Reagan was a guest on the broadcast of 18 March 1949, when he stood in for Bill Stern. Bibliography * Allgood, Jill Bebe and Ben, (1975) London, Robert Hale & Co.

Description Clarke et al. (2006) found that the most primitive known euornithians (the Yanornithiformes) had a mosaic of advanced and primitive features. These species retained primitive features like gastralia (belly ribs) and a pubic symphysis. They also showed the first fully modern pygostyles, and the type specimen of Yixianornis (IVPP 13631) preserves eight elongated rectrices (tail feathers) in a modern arrangement. No earlier pygostylians are known which preserve a fan of tail feathers of this sort; instead, they showed only paired plumes or a tuft of short feathers. Classification The name Euornithes has been used for a wide variety of avialan groups since it was first named by Edward Drinker Cope in 1889. It was first defined as a clade in 1998 by Paul Sereno, who made it the group of all animals closer to birds than to Enantiornithes (represented by Sinornis). This definition currently includes similar content as another widely used name, Ornithuromorpha, named and defined by Luis Chiappe in 1999 as the common ancestor of Patagopteryx, Vorona, and Ornithurae, plus all of its descendants. Because one definition is node-based and the other branch- based, Ornithuromorpha is a slightly less inclusive group. =Relationships= The cladogram below follows the results of a phylogenetic analysis by Lee et al., 2014: =Other genera= The following is a list of primitive euornithian genera and those that cannot be confidently referred to any subgroups, following Holtz (2011) unless otherwise noted.Holtz, Thomas R.

It may be a viable option for people who prefer 'pay-as-you-go' storage, in which only items that are stored are charged storage fees, rather than renting a larger storage unit that may not be fully utilized. Overview Mail storage may not be viable or cost-effective for those wanting to store a whole house full of belongings. It's generally an option for those who want to declutter or store a proportion of their goods for a short amount of time. Mail storage differs from traditional self-storage in a number of key ways: * Mail storage allows customers to order boxes online or over the phone. Generally mail storage companies will send these boxes free of charge along with packing materials and tape although some may charge a small fee for this. * Customers pack their boxes in their office or home and these are then collected by the storage company or sent directly to self-storage using standard shippers such as FedEx, UPS, US Postal Service and the like. Again, many mail storage companies offer this collection service free of charge although some will charge a fee. * Customers pay a monthly fee per box that they store with the mail storage company. Some companies have a minimum number of boxes required to utilize the service. Others have no minimum and customers can store only one box if they so wish. * When a customer wants a box returned, typically a request is made online or by phone, and then the box(es) are returned per an agreed-upon timeframe. Mechanisms Typically, customers sign-up online with a mail storage company. The customer can then order boxes from the storage provider or they can use boxes that they already own. The storage company arranges for the packed boxes to be collected from the customer's pick-up location. The boxes are then transported to the storage company's secure warehouse to be stored until the customer requests their return. The storage company then arranges for the box(es) to be returnedtypically within 24 hours (if it falls on a weekday). Mail Storage requires more stringent and diligent packing than standard moving, since the packages will be handled by shippers or a mail storage company's pickup/delivery service. For example, the thin walls of standard moving boxes cannot withstand the multiple transfers, stacking and other rigors of the shipping / mailing process. Further, failing to pack the boxes fully may result in boxes that \\"cave in\\" when other boxes are stacked on them. Mail Storage companies often request customers to use thick walled or reinforced shipping boxes, to reinforce the seams with heavy duty packing tape, and to pack boxes to their fullest (while not over-stuffing them). This advice applies to boxes provided by Mail Storage firms as well as boxes provided by the customer. Many mail storage companies charge re-boxing and handling fees for boxes that are poorly packed or damaged on arrival. In addition, insurance charges that were paid by customers may not apply for boxes that were damaged in transit. History Mail storage is a relatively new concept with startup companies in Great Britain and the US. In the US, many companies have launched and continue to offer services today, while a few early innovators are no longer in business. The market has quickly evolved to become specialized, with a number of variations on the initial Mail Storage concept currently being offered. For example, services that target the higher education populations offer drop off and pick up to college dormitories, and \\"micro self-storage\\" services offer less-than-full storage containers delivered to a residence. Some services provide customized cardboard or plastic boxes and/or packing materials as part of the cost, standardizing the boxes for optimal storage while adding a requisite waiting time for the packing materials and boxes to arrive. Other variants allow customers to self pack and send boxes directly to self-storage one box at a time (or as many boxes as needed) and offer to-the- doorstep delivery in another location, eliminating the requirement to pick up items in the same location as where they were stored.

This asymmetric tuning of the Schottky barrier height is the piezotronic effect. Piezotronics effect is using the piezoelectric potential (piezopotential) created in materials with piezoelectricity as a ‚Äúgate‚Äù voltage to tune/control the charge carrier transport properties for fabricating new devices. Neil A Downie showed how simple it was to build simple demonstrations on a macro-scale using a sandwich of piezoelectric material and carbon piezoresistive material to make an FET-like amplifying device and put it in a book of science projects for students in 2006. The fundamental principle of piezotronics was introduced by Prof. Zhong Lin Wang at Georgia Institute of Technology in 2007. Zhong Lin Wang, ‚ÄúNanopiezotronics‚Äù, Advanced Materials, 2007, 19, 889-892.

Piezotronics is likely to have important applications in sensor, human-silicon technology interfacing, MEMS, nanorobotics and active flexible electronics. Mechanism Working mechanism for piezoelectric devices with one end of the piezoelectric material is fixed. The induced piezopotential distribution is similar to the applied gate voltage in a traditional field-effect transistor, as shown in (b). Schematic diagram showing the three-way coupling among piezoelectricity, photoexcitation and semiconductor. Due to the non-central symmetry in materials such as the wurtzite structured ZnO, GaN and InN, a piezopotential is created in the crystal by applying a stress. Owing to the simultaneous possession of piezoelectricity and semiconductor properties, the piezopotential created in the crystal has a strong effect on the carrier transport process. Generally, the construction of the basic piezotronic devices can be divided into two categories. Here we use the nanowires as the example. The first kind is that the piezoelectric nanowire was put on a flexible substrate with two ends fixed by the electrodes. In this case, when the substrate is bended, the nanowire will be purely stretched or compressed. Piezopotential will be introduced along its axis. It will modify the electric field or the Schottky barrier (SB) height at the contact area. The induced positive piezopotential at one end will reduce the SB height, while the negative piezopotential at the other end will increase it. Thus the electric transport properties will be changed. The second kind of the piezotronic device is that one end of the nanowire is fixed with electrode, while the other end is free. In this case, when a force is applied at the free end of the nanowire to bend it, the piezopotential distribution will be perpendicular to the axis of the nanowire. The introduced piezoelectric field is perpendicular to electron transport direction, just like applying a gate voltage in the traditional field-effect transistor. Thus the electron transport properties will also be changed. The materials for piezotronics should be piezoelectric semiconductors, Zhong Lin Wang ‚ÄúPiezopotential Gated Nanowire Devices: Piezotronics and Piezo-phototronics‚Äù, Nano Today, 5 (2010) 540-552. such as ZnO, GaN and InN. Three-way coupling among piezoelectricity, photoexcitation and semiconductor is the basis of piezotronics (piezoelectricity-semiconductor coupling), piezophotonics (piezoelectric- photon excitation coupling), optoelectronics, and piezophototronics (piezoelectricity-semiconductor-photoexcitation). The core of these coupling relies on the piezopotential created by the piezoelectric materials.

He is a ballet dancer, choreographer and director. He studied classical ballet for several years before becoming a choreographer for various professional companies. Due to his success, he has won many awards and honorary titles within the ballet community. Life Zanella studied classical dance in his hometown before going on to complete his ballet education at √âcole sup√©rieure de danse de Cannes Rosella Hightower. His first engagement as a dancer came in 1982 in Basel with Heinz Spoerli. Zanella joined the Stuttgart Ballet in 1985 and was appointed permanent choreographer there in 1993, thanks to artistic director Marcia Hayd√©e. In 1995, he was appointed artistic director and resident choreographer for the Vienna State Opera, a position he held for ten years until the end of the 2004/2005 season.

Four people were stabbed in the scuffles, which also involved fans from other clubs and were viewed by the media as part of a retaliation for the killing of two Leeds United fans by Galatasaray supporters the month before. The events of the day started early in the morning when skirmishes broke out in a bar, which led to an Arsenal fan being stabbed. Later in the day, Galatasaray fans occupied City Hall Square before heading towards Arsenal fans in bars nearby. The Galatasaray fans were later attacked from behind by members of British hooligan firms seeking revenge for the Istanbul stabbings. The police had prior warning of potential trouble and deployed 2,000 officers to the area, yet they were unable to control the riot until they fired tear gas. This led to 19 injuries, including 4 stabbings, and 60 arrests with similar events occurring in England and Turkey in the aftermath of the riots. Football authorities condemned the riots and threatened to expel national football teams from European competition if such events happened again. The Danish police also were criticized for their handling of the riots. History Istanbul's Taksim Square was the scene of rioting in the previous round of the 1999‚Äì2000 UEFA Cup. Arsenal qualified for the final by defeating French club Lens in their semi-final. Galatasaray beat English team Leeds United but their matches were marred by violence: two Leeds United fans were stabbed to death before their semi-final first leg at Galatasaray's Ali Sami Yen Stadium in Istanbul on 6 April 2000. The events happened at 22:00 in Istanbul's Taksim Square during a fight between Leeds fans and Galatasaray fans. Leeds fans had been drinking in bars reportedly taunting local people and Turkish police intervened to stop fights breaking out. There were reports that a Galatasaray fan had run to a telephone to call for support when he saw Leeds fans arriving. Galatasaray fans entered the area shortly afterwards which precipitated a fight between the two sets of supporters. This led to the two Leeds fans being stabbed. Galatasaray playing Leeds United during the second leg semi-final match at Elland Road. Only 80 away fans were allowed to attend. It was not clear how the fight started, with reports of it either being started by Leeds fans throwing beer glasses and insulting the Turkish flag, or being started by Galatasaray fans throwing chairs. Police arrested Ali Umit Demir and three other men for the stabbings. Demir was later found guilty of murder and was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment, but released in 2004. As a result of the stabbings, Leeds United banned Galatasaray fans from attending the second leg at Elland Road, claiming that the safety of fans could not be guaranteed. The ban was supported by UEFA and only 80 tickets were issued to Galatasaray for officials and representatives of the Turkish government. The stabbings caused anger throughout the United Kingdom, and subsequently members of Arsenal's hooligan firms The Herd and The Gooners, wanted to avenge the deaths of the Leeds fans, and telephoned other British hooligan firms, inviting them to join them in Copenhagen to attack Galatasaray fans. It was reported that members of Leeds United's Leeds United Service Crew and Chelsea's Chelsea Headhunters, along with hooligans supporting Rangers, Cardiff City and Swansea City all travelled to Denmark to join Arsenal fans in attacks on Galatasaray fans. This led to the final being considered \\"high risk\\"; 2,000 members of the Danish police were assigned to the game, with assistance from members of British and Turkish police forces. Events =In Copenhagen= Copenhagen's City Hall Square was the site of the riot. On the Wednesday at 1:00, Galatasaray fans attacked a bar in Str√∏get in Copenhagen, where some Arsenal fans were located. The Arsenal fans left the bar to confront the Galatasaray fans, which led to a fight lasting for an hour before riot police managed to control it and arrested four Britons and four Turks. In the fight, Paul Dineen, an Arsenal fan, was stabbed, leading to Arsenal offering fans refunds if they did not want to fly to the game. Dineen was released from hospital later in the day and attended the match as a guest of the Arsenal directors. Throughout the day large numbers of fans, both English and Turkish, were seen throughout the city and at the airport. Later, large numbers of Galatasaray fans congregated in Copenhagen's City Hall Square, raising the Turkish flag in the square. Arsenal fans congregated in nearby bars. Galatasaray fans attempted to provoke the Arsenal fans in the bars, and the two sides began chanting at each other until bottles were thrown from both sides around 16:00. The Danish police then moved in to separate the fans, and moved the Galatasaray fans back towards the square. the Final, held at Parken Stadium. Then, in a calculated attack, approximately 500 Arsenal fans attacked from the main road behind the Galatasaray fans. This caused a severe riot in the city square, with several restaurant facilities used by fans to fight each other, with iron bars and knives also being used. This lasted 20 minutes before the Danish police attempted to break up the melee with dogs and tear gas. The violence, which included fans from other English clubs and Turks living in Denmark, lasted for 45 minutes. There were further clashes at the airport the day after the game. At Parken Stadium, where the final was to be played, the police erected iron fencing outside to separate the Arsenal and Galatasaray fans as a precaution. UEFA also requested that fences be put up around the perimeter of the pitch. The riots did not spread to the stadium, although there was an attempt to pull down the fences by fans heading towards the Arsenal area of the stadium before police stopped them. =In England and Turkey= After the match, which Galatasaray won 4‚Äì1 on penalties, approximately 300 Arsenal fans in the Finsbury Park area of Islington in London attacked Turkish restaurants and businesses, with bottles being used to break windows. They then broke into an apartment building to threaten Kosovan refugees with a knife, mistakenly believing them to be Turkish. Six people were arrested and three Metropolitan Police officers were injured. In Turkey, nine people were accidentally shot and injured by Galatasaray fans firing guns in celebration despite police warning them not to. Injuries and arrests In all, four people were stabbed during the riots: two English, one Turkish and one Dutch fan. A Danish police officer and a Turkish cameraman were also injured in the riots. In total, nineteen people were injured and sixty people were arrested, with 15 of the arrested being subsequently banned from attending Euro 2000. Nineteen of the arrested were British, thirty-six were Turkish and the rest of the arrested included people from Sweden, Germany and the Netherlands. The British fans were later released without charge but were forbidden from returning to Denmark. The rest were fined an equivalent of $500 and banned from Denmark for a year. Aftermath The day after the riots, FA Executive Director David Davies, issued an apology for the violence. The Copenhagen riots followed a long line of similar events involving English football fans, and in June, UEFA's executive committee listed the Heysel Stadium disaster, disorders in Charleroi and Brussels, the killing of the two Leeds fans in Istanbul, and the Copenhagen riots and warned the British government that if there was any more rioting then England would be expelled from Euro 2000. In response, Prime Minister Tony Blair stated: Turkish Prime Minister B√ºlent Ecevit also made a call for fans to avoid violence after the riots, stating: In August 2000, Arsenal banned thirty-seven people involved in the Copenhagen riot from Arsenal's Highbury stadium. Leeds United also banned three of their fans from Elland Road after they had been identified in pictures of the riots. In the United Kingdom, Arsenal fans were originally blamed for the violence as the police had fixed blame on them. In Turkey, the media portrayed Galatasaray fans as acting in self-defence, with criticism directed at the British fans for allegedly attacking members of the press. However, there were conflicting reports, with claims that some Galatasaray fans were instigating some of the violence. Later on, British media blame also transferred towards Galatasaray fans. The Danish police were also criticised for their handling of the riots. Their policing of City Hall Square in the days running up to the final was described as \\"non-existent\\" by Dineen. It was noted by Turkish newspaper, Radikal that cannabis was being freely traded in the city square during the time before the riots, and the police did nothing about it. Arsenal fans also criticised the police, claiming that they had been slow to intervene and were \\"too soft\\" on the hooligans. It was claimed that the police failed to control the riots, and that they had been undermanned and outmaneuvered, to which Mogens Laurisden, the police chief in Copenhagen admitted that the police had been \\"under-prepared\\". This came after Arsenal had warned the police before the final that there could be hooligans travelling to Copenhagen. Arsenal invited Galatasaray to play in the Emirates Cup of 2013. In the United Kingdom, the Daily Mirror newspaper printed pictures of Arsenal fans alleged to have been part of the violence. It later arose that the majority of the people in the photos were either not involved or had been acting in self- defence. The photos led to some postmen working for Royal Mail losing their jobs because they had been seen in the photos and in television coverage, even though they had not been arrested. Michael Doherty, the chairman of the Communication Workers Union, and his brother Tom took Royal Mail to an Employment Tribunal for unfair dismissal claiming they had been acting in self-defence. In 2001, the tribunal ruled in their favour, and ordered Royal Mail to reinstate them. In 2012 Piers Morgan, the editor of the Daily Mirror at the time and a high-profile Arsenal fan who attended the match, apologised for printing the pictures. In 2013, Arsenal invited Galatasaray to compete at their annual Emirates Cup tournament. Some Arsenal fans reacted negatively to the news, claiming that there was still bad blood between the two sets of supporters and were concerned that there would be a resumption of hostilities between them.

Meningitis is an inflammation of the meninges, the protective membranes of the central nervous system, is more common in the neonatal period (infants less than 44 days old) than any other time in life, and is an important cause of morbidity and mortality globally. Mortality is roughly half in developing countries and ranges from 8%-12.5% in developed countries. Symptoms seen with neonatal meningitis are often unspecific and may point to several conditions, such as sepsis (whole body inflammation). These can include fever, irritability, and dyspnea. The only method to determine if meningitis is the cause of these symptoms is lumbar puncture (an examination of the cerebrospinal fluid). The most common causes of neonatal meningitis is bacterial infection of the blood, known as bacteremia (specifically group B streptococci (Streptococcus agalactiae), Escherichia coli, and Listeria monocytogenes). Although there is a low mortality rate in developed countries, there is a 50% prevalence rate of neurodevelopmental disabilities after meningitis caused by E. coli and Streptococcus agalactiae, and a 79% prevalence after meningitis caused by Gram-negative rods other than E. coli. Delayed treatment of neonatal meningitis may cause cerebral palsy, blindness, deafness, seizure disorders, and learning deficiencies. Signs and symptoms The following is a list of common signs and symptoms of neonatal meningitis. *Fever *poor appetite *anterior fontanelle bulging *seizures *jitteriness *dyspnea *irritability *anorexia *vomiting *diarrhea *abdominal distention (increase in abdominal size) *neck rigidity *cyanosis *jaundice *sunset eyes (downward gaze of the eyes) *abnormal body temperature (hypo-or hyperthermia) *change of activity (lethargy or irritability) These symptoms are unspecific and may point to many different conditions. =Complications= Neuroimaging (X-ray imaging of the brain) is recommended to detect the complications of meningitis. Complications should be suspected when the clinical course is characterized by shock, respiratory failure, focal neurological deficits, a positive cerebrospinal fluid culture after 48 to 72 hours of appropriate antibiotic therapy, or infection with certain organisms, such as Citrobacter koseri and Cronobacter sakazakii for example. Ultrasounds are useful for early imaging to determine ventricular size and hemorrhaging. CT scans later in the therapy should be used to dictate prolonged treatment. If intracranial abscesses (collection of pus in the brain) are found, treatment consisting of a combination of surgical drainage of the abscess and antimicrobial therapy for 4 to 6 weeks is recommended. More imaging should be completed after the end of antibiotic treatment because abscesses have been found after weeks from start of treatment. Relapses have also occurred after appropriate treatment when infected by Gram-negative enteric bacilli. =Hearing Loss= Meningitis is one of the leading causes of acquired deafness. Nearly 8% of those with Meningitis will have a permanent sensorineural hearing loss. The longer meningitis is left untreated, the greater the risk of seizures and permanent neurological damage such as hearing loss, memory difficulty, learning disabilities, brain damage, gait problems, kidney failure, shock, and even death. Hearing loss in those with Meningitis can occur when the body is fighting off the infection and the cells reach the inner ear where the hair cells and nerve fibers become damaged. Hearing loss can also occur after Meningitis is resolved due to an increased risk for ossification of the cochlea. Ossification of the cochlea can make it difficult to place a Cochlear Implant for hearing losses that are treated unsuccessfully with hearing aids. Bacterial Meningitis is likely to lead to hearing loss. It is important to have a hearing test as soon as possible. It would be best to complete a hearing test before leaving the hospital or within four weeks of improvement of symptoms. Fluctuating hearing loss has been observed in a large number of patients, so it is best to have routine hearing tests to monitor the hearing loss. Viral Meningitis is less likely to cause hearing loss and it is recommended to perform a hearing test if the patient is experiencing any hearing difficulties. All hearing losses are different so there is no predictive loss for Meningitis. Children are assessed through behavioral testing (if old enough), Otoacoustic Emissions (OAEs), and Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR). Impact in Children for Communication If hearing loss is left undetected and/or untreated, this can lead to later acquisition of language and delayed reading skills. Since untreated Meningitis can cause brain damage and learning disabilities, children with a history of Meningitis may be developmentally delayed when compared to their typically developing peers. =Laboratory features= Laboratory features that are characteristic of neonatal bacterial meningitis include: *Isolation of a bacterial pathogen from the cerebrospinal fluid by culture and/or visualization by Gram stain *Increased cerebrospinal fluid white blood cell count (typically >1000 white blood cells/ŒºL, but may be lower, especially with Gram-positive bacteria), usually with a predominance of neutrophils *Elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein concentration (>150 mg/dL in preterm (premature birth) and >100 mg/dL in term infants) *Decreased cerebrospinal fluid glucose concentration (<20 mg/dL [1.1 mmol/L] in preterm (premature birth) and <30 mg/dL [1.7 mmol/L] in term (on time) infants) Causes Streptococci Escherichia coli Electron micrograph of a flagellated Listeria monocytogenes, Magnified 41,250X. Streptococcus pneumoniae in cerebrospinal fluid Scanning electron micrograph shows Staphylococcus aureus. Transmission electron micrograph of Herpes simplex virus. Neonatal meningitis is caused by group B streptococci Streptococcus agalactiae (39%-48% of cases), Escherichia coli (30%-35%), other Gram-negative rods (8%-12%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (about 6%), and Listeria monocytogenes (5%-7%). Meningitis is typically caused from either a bacterial or viral infection, however, it can be caused by fungal, parasitic, or amebic infections as well. Even more rare, Meningitis can be caused by some cancers, Lupus, specific drugs, head injuries, and brain surgeries. Most neonatal meningitis results from bacteremia (bacterial infection of the blood). =Early-onset= In early-onset neonatal meningitis, acquisition of the bacteria is from the mother either before the baby is born or during birth. The most common bacteria found in early-onset are Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, and Listeria monocytogenes. In developing countries, Gram- negative enteric (gut) bacteria are responsible for the majority of early onset meningitis. =Late-onset= Late-onset meningitis may be caused by other Gram-negative bacteria and staphylococcal species. In developing countries, Streptococcus pneumoniae accounts for most cases of late onset. =Herpes Simplex Virus= Herpes simplex virus is a rare cause of meningitis, occurring only 0.165 in 10,000 live births in the UK and 0.2-5 in 10,000 live births in the USKimberlin, D. (2004). Herpes simplex virus, meningitis and encephalitis in neonates. breast, 20, 22. Both HSV-1 and HSV-2 can cause neonatal meningitis, however, HSV-2 accounts for 70% of the cases. Herpes simplex virus is transmitted to neonates mainly during delivery (when infected maternal secretions come into contact with the baby and accounting for 85% of cases), but also occur in utero (while the fetus is still in the womb, 5% of cases) or even post-delivery, receiving the infection from the community (10% of cases). The most important factors impacting the transmission of the virus is the stage of the mother's infection (symptomatic or non-symptomatic) and the damage of any maternal membranes during birth (the longer the tissue is damaged, the higher the chance of neonatal infection). Pathogenesis Generally, the progression of neonatal meningitis starts with bacteria colonizing the gastrointestinal tract. The bacteria then invades through the intestinal mucosa layer into the blood, causing bacteremia followed by invasion of the cerebrospinal fluid. The neonate's less efficient immune system (especially the alternative complement system) lessens their defense against invading bacteria. Colonization of the mother plays an important role in transmission to the neonate, causing early-onset meningitis. =Group B Streptococcus= Neonatal Streptococcus agalactiae infection is acquired in utero or during passage through the vagina. Evidence suggests that vaginal colonization by Streptococcus agalactiae during pregnancy increases the risk of vertical transmission and early-onset disease in neonates. =Neonatal meningitis-causing E. coli= Some strains of E. coli have a capsule, called K1, which protects the bacteria from the innate immune system and allows it to penetrate the central nervous system. The capsule contains sialic acid, which is found widely in humans and so does not set off the defenses of the body. Sialic acid also plays a role in the bacteria's ability to invade through the blood-brain barrier. The capsule can be variably O-acetylated. Diagnosis =Bacterial Infection= A lumbar puncture (spinal tap) is necessary to diagnose meningitis. Cerebrospinal fluid culture is the most important study for the diagnosis of neonatal bacterial meningitis because clinical signs are non-specific and unreliable. Blood cultures may be negative in 15-55% of cases, making them unreliable as well. However, a cerebrospinal fluid to blood glucose ratio below two-thirds has a strong relationship to bacterial meningitis.Sivanandan, S., Soraisham, A. S., & Swarnam, K. (2011). Choice and duration of antimicrobial therapy for neonatal sepsis and meningitis. International Journal of Pediatrics, 2011 A spinal tap should be done in all neonates with suspected meningitis, with suspected or proven sepsis (whole body inflammation) and should be considered in all neonates in whom sepsis is a possibility. The role of the spinal tap in neonates who are healthy appearing but have maternal risk factors for sepsis is more controversial; its diagnostic yield in these patients may be low. Early-onset is deemed when infection is within one week of birth. Late-onset is deemed after the first week. =Viral Infection= Babies born from mothers with symptoms of Herpes simplex virus should be tested for viral infection. Liver tests, complete blood count, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and a chest X-ray should all be completed to diagnose meningitis. Samples should be taken from skin, conjunctiva (eye), mouth and throat, rectum, urine, and the cerebrospinal fluid for viral culture and polymerase chain reaction. Prevention =Bacterial= Prevention of neonatal meningitis is primarily intrapartum (during labor) antibiotic prophylaxis (prevention) of pregnant mothers to decrease chance of early-onset meningitis by Streptococcus agalactiae. For late-onset meningitis, prevention is passed onto the caretakers to stop the spread of infectious microorganisms. Proper hygiene habits are first and foremost, while stopping improper antibiotic use; such as over-prescriptions, use of broad spectrum antibiotics, and extended dosing times will aid prevention of late-onset neonatal meningitis. A possible prevention may be vaccination of mothers against Streptococcus agalactiae and E. coli, however, this is still under development. =Viral= The only form of prevention from viral infection of the neonate is a Caesarean section form of delivery if the mother is showing symptoms of infection. Treatment cal structure of penicillin cal structure of gentamicin Chemical structure of cefotaxime Chemical structure of Ceftazidime Chemical structure of ampicillin Chemical structure of aciclovir Treatment for meningitis is antibiotics. The particular drugs used are based on culture results that identify the infecting bacteria, but a mix of ampicillin, gentamicin, and cefotaxime is used for early-onset meningitis before their identification. A regimen of antistaphylococcal antibiotic, such as nafcillin or vancomycin, plus cefotaxime or ceftazidime with or without an aminoglycoside is recommended for late-onset neonatal meningitis. The aim for these treatments is to sterilize the cerebrospinal fluid of all pathogens. A repeat spinal tap 24 to 48 hours after treatment has been started should be done to confirm sterilization. Limited evidence suggests that adjuvant corticosteroids may reduce the short-term risk of hearing loss in newborn infants with meningitis, but it is uncertain whether corticosteroids help to reduce the risk of death or longer-term hearing loss. =Group B Streptococci= For meningitis suspected to be caused by Streptococcus agalactiae, the following treatment is recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics: doses of penicillin up to 450 000 U/kg daily (270 mg/kg/day) divided 8 hourly if <7 days of age and divided 6 hourly if >7 days of age. For penicillin [the recommended dose is up to 300 mg/kg/daily divided 8 hourly if <7 days of age or 4‚Äì6 hourly if >7 days of age. After confirmation of Streptococcus agalactiae by culture, penicillin alone should be used for the rest of the course of treatment, including the 14-day post- sterilization therapy. =Gram-negative Enterics= For suspected Gram- negative enteric (including E. coli) meningitis a combination of cefotaxime and aminoglycoside, usually gentamicin, is recommended. This treatment should last for 14 days after sterilization and then only cefotaxime for another 7 days creating a minimum of 21 days of therapy after sterilization. =Listeria monocytogenes= Meningitis caused by Listeria monocytogenes should be treated with a combination of ampicillin and gentamicin because it is synergistic in vitro and provides more rapid bacterial clearance in animal models of infection. =Streptococcus pneumoniae= Streptococcus pneumoniae can be treated with either penicillin or ampicillin. =Herpes Simplex Virus= In cases of meningitis caused by Herpes simplex virus, antiviral therapy with (acyclovir or vidarabine) must be started immediately for a favorable outcome. Acyclovir is a better antiviral because it shows a similar effect on the infection as vidarabine and is safer to use in neonates. The recommended dosage is 20 mg/kg every six hours for 21 days. Epidemiology In industrialized countries, the incidence of bacterial meningitis is approximately 3 in 10,000 live births. The incidence of Herpes simplex virus meningitis is estimated to be 0.2-5.0 cases per 10,000 live births. Neonatal meningitis is much more common in developing countries. Neonatal meningitis ranges from 4.8 per 10,000 live births in Hong Kong to 24 per 10,000 live births in Kuwait. In Africa and South Asia, figures ranging from 8.0 to 61 per 10,000 live births are found. It is expected that these numbers are lower than reality due to the difficulty of diagnosing and the healthcare available to underdeveloped countries in Asia and Africa.

Biography He was a son of the Count W≈Çadys≈Çaw Gurowski, an ardent admirer of Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko. Having been expelled in 1818 and again in 1819 from the gymnasia of Warsaw and Kalisz for revolutionary demonstrations, young Gurowski continued his studies at various German universities. He studied under Hegel at Berlin University and obtained a degree from Heidelberg University. Returning to Warsaw in 1825, he became identified with those opposed to Russian influence, and was in consequence several times imprisoned. He was active in organizing the November Uprising of 1830, in which he afterward took part. On its suppression, Adam lost the greater part of his estates and escaped to France, where he lived for several years. While there he became associated with the Saint-Simonians, and adopted many of the views of Charles Fourier. He was also a member of the national Polish committee in Paris, and became conspicuous in political and literary circles. The remainder of his estates had in the meantime been confiscated and he himself condemned to death. He married Theresa de Zbijewska in 1827. They had two children. Theresa died in 1832. In 1835, he published a work entitled La v√©rit√© sur la Russie, in which he advocated a union of the different branches of the Slavic race. The book being favorably regarded by the Russian government, Gurowski was recalled, and, although his estates were not restored, he was employed in the civil service. In 1843, the Marquis de Custine, lover of Gurowski's brother Ignacy, published La Russie en 1839, a polemical travelogue focusing on the Russian Empire. In 1844, finding that he had many powerful enemies at court, Gurowski left secretly for Berlin and went thence to Heidelberg. Here he gave himself to study, and for two years lectured on political economy in the University of Bern, Switzerland. He then went to Italy. In 1849, he went to the United States, where he engaged in literary pursuits and became deeply interested in American politics. He wrote articles for the American Cyclopaedia and worked on the editorial staff of the New York Tribune. During the Crimean War, he sided with Russia, and his editorials and pamphlets were an effective influence on American public opinion in favor of Russia. He was strongly opposed to slavery. After president Lincoln's election and in the lead up to his inauguration, Gurowski met with pro-Union Republicans in Washington who were delegates to the \\"Peace Conference,\\" warning them of secessionist plots to disrupt the electoral college and further, of Southern intentions to foment takeover of the government either at the time electoral ballots were counted or on March 4‚Äîinauguration day.L. E. Chittenden memoir, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury in the Lincoln administration, published 1891. From 1861 to 1863, he was translator in the State Department in Washington D.C., being acquainted with eight languages. In 1862, he published the first volume of his three- volume Diary. It included three categories of men: Praise, Half and Half and Blame. President Abraham Lincoln merited the Praise column, as did Edwin M. Stanton and poet Walt Whitman, but otherwise Gurowski was highly critical of officials in the Lincoln administration. William O‚ÄôConnor, who translated some of the count‚Äôs papers into English, described him as ‚Äúa madman with lucid intervals.‚Äù Whitman wrote, \\"He knew every thing & growled & found fault with everybody‚Äîbut was always very courteous to me.\\" Count Gurowski died in May 1866 and was buried in Congressional Cemetery.

Life He was the son of a farmer at Overtown, Lecropt, on the borders of Perthshire and Stirlingshire; and was named after Robert Haldane, then proprietor of Airthrey Castle. He was educated at the school in Dunblane, and then at Glasgow University. Haldane became a private tutor, first in the family at Leddriegreen, Strathblane, and later with Col. Charles Moray of Abercairnie. On 5 December 1797, he was licensed as a preacher by the presbytery of Auchterarder, but he did not obtain a charge quickly. In August 1806, he was presented to the church of Drummelzier, in the presbytery of Peebles, and was ordained on 19 March 1807. When the chair of mathematics became vacant in the University of St. Andrews in 1807, Haldane was appointed to the professorship, and resigned his charge at Drummelzier on 2 October 1809. He remained in the post till 1820, when he was promoted by the crown to the pastoral charge of St. Andrews parish, vacant by the death of Principal George Hill, D.D. His predecessor had held the principalship of St. Mary's College in St. Andrews in conjunction with his ministerial office, and the same arrangement was followed in the case of Haldane, who was admitted on 28 September 1820. As principal he was ex officio primarius professor of divinity. On 17 May 1827 Haldane was elected moderator of the general assembly of the church of Scotland. At the time of the disruption of 1843 Haldane was called to the chair ad interim. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1820, his proposers being George Dunbar, Robert Jameson, Alexander Brunton and Patrick Neill.https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf In 1828 his role as Moderator was succeeded by Rev Stevenson McGill. He died at St. Mary's College, St. Andrews, on 9 March 1854, in his eighty-third year, and was buried in the cathedral cemetery there. The grave lies on the north wall just left of the distinctive white military memorial to Lt Col Sir Hugh Lyon Playfair. Haldane's marble inscription is badly eroded. His portrait was in the hall of the university library at St. Andrews. He was succeeded by John Tulloch. Haldane's only publication was a small work relating to the condition of the poor in St. Andrews (Cupar, 1841).

The game revolves around the Wuxia-inspired lore surrounding martial arts and adventures in Ming Dynasty China. The European version, Age of Wulin, which had been published by Webzen, closed in July 2017, with players being given the option of transferring to a new European server established as part of Age of Wushu, the version of the game published by Snail USA.  Gameplay  Players initially select one of eight factions, and then develop their characters, learn new skills, and engage in PvE and PvP content. The game does not feature a class system, but allows players to join one of 8 player factions, or Schools: Shaolin, Wudang, Emei, Beggars' Sect, Tang Clan, Scholar's Academy, Royal Guard and Wanderer's Valley. The only restricted skills are the internal skills of each school. This means if a player leaves their faction, or school, the player loses the ability to use that school's internal skill. Quests and many other activities, including gathering, crafting and combat, give experience points which are converted into \\"cultivation\\" points used to upgrade fighting skills. Elements of the game include solo and party dungeons, an equipment system, crafting and professions, a housing system, and mounts. The attributes of Chivalry and Guilt determine the player's reputation and alignment in the Jianghu System. = Combat = The in-game combat contains actual martial arts as well as superhuman abilities and elements from Chinese legendary stories such as those depicted in films like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Hero. There are no classes or level restrictions. Instead the game uses a skill-based system in which the player has to learn new abilities and talents in order to progress. Combat depends on skill proficiency rather than any assigned numerical value. There are three types of skills, akin to the Rock paper scissors game: Overt (damage skills), Feint (defense-breaking skills), and Block (blocks incoming damage). There are also assorted skills outside of these categories. Utilizing skills consumes Energy, the equivalent of a Mana pool. = Factions = Instead of a school, players may instead choose a faction. Factions were released in the Tempest of Strife expansion. Secret Factions: Peach Blossom Island, Shifting Flowers Palace, Rootless Clan Jianghu Factions: Golden Needle Shen Family, Xu Family Village, Beast Villa  Development  Promotion at E3 2012 The original Chinese version, named ‰πùÈò¥ÁúüÁªè () began beta testing in 2009 and was commercially launched in 2012. Over the next few years, the game was launched in more regions with different names: North America (Age of Wushu), Europe (Age of Wulin), Russia (Legends of Kung Fu), Thailand (9Yin) and Southeast Asia (Age Of Kung Fu). On 6 January 2016, the mobile version Age of Wushu Dynasty was launched for both iOS and Android. Beta testing for Age of Wushu 2 began in 2017.

Hobbs was ordained in 1958 and was an assistant curate of Clewer, Berkshire and, in 1960, moved to St Anne‚Äôs Soho. He and his wife, Mary, were both appointed lecturers at the Borough Teacher Training College, where they remained until both were made redundant in 1978. During that time he also assisted at St Stephen‚Äôs Church in Gloucester Road, Kensington, where T. S. Eliot worshipped. He then joined the staff of the Bishop of Chichester as a domestic chaplain and, in 1981, was appointed the Archdeacon of Chichester, serving in the post for 10 years until his retirement. Hobbs married the historian Mary Ruderman in Wolverhampton in 1950. They had three children, one of whom died young.

It is said to have almost ‚Äúa sculptural surface with a translucent glaze over paint‚Äù. This piece is housed in the Gem√§ldegalerie Alte Meister in Kassel, Germany. Background Jacob Blessing the Sons of Joseph shows a scene from the Old Testament book of Genesis, Chapter 48. In this scene, Joseph brings his two sons (Manasseh and Ephraim) to his dying father Jacob so that they can receive the family blessing. According to tradition, the eldest son is blessed with the patriarch‚Äôs right hand. However, Jacob deliberately crossed his arms and put his right hand on Ephraim‚Äôs (the younger son‚Äôs) head and his left hand on Manasseh‚Äôs (the oldest son‚Äôs) head. Joseph was displeased and thought that his father was making a mistake. When Joseph tried to correct his father, Jacob refused and told Joseph that he was purposefully blessing the younger son. Differences Manasseh appears to wear a scowl at being overlooked, and if Jacob's hand appears to favor Ephraim's head, Rembrandt has slyly suggested that Joseph has had a hand in this mixup. An ostensibly tender familial interaction, the friction between Joseph and Jacob swells beneath the surface. Also, Rembrandt included the mother of the children, Asenath. Asenath Asenath was the daughter of an Egyptian priest. According to chapter 41 in the book of Genesis, she was given to Joseph by the pharaoh, himself. The purpose of adding Asenath to the painting is unknown. However, some think that Rembrandt was incorporating 17th century Dutch culture into the painting. Dutch wives were beginning to be viewed more as colleague to their husbands. With this mindset, it would only be logical that Asenath would be present at such an important event as the blessing of her children. Artistic qualities Rembrandt is famous for his use of light and shadow (Chiaroscuro) and Jacob Blessing the Sons of Joseph is not an exception. This draws attention to the main characters of Jacob, Joseph, Ephraim, Manasseh, and Asenath while obscuring the background. In particular, there seems to be a halo surrounding Ephraim as he is being blessed. Also notable is the prominent colors that Rembrandt used. The yellows, browns, and reds give the painting a mood that is ‚Äúboth intimate and sacred, tender and solemn‚Äù.

The original house complex was the residence of Texas patriot Jos√© Antonio Navarro (1795‚Äì1871), a rancher, merchant, leading advocate for Tejano rights, and one of only two native-born Texans to sign the Texas Declaration of Independence. Navarro first bought the property, about 1.5 acres, in 1832. The limestone, caliche block, and adobe structures were built c. 1832‚Äì1855, and Navarro moved onto the property soon after. The site is situated in the heart of old San Antonio, in what used to be a thriving Tejano neighborhood known as Laredito. The structures were acquired and restored by the San Antonio Conservation Society between 1960 and 1964, and the site was opened to the public in October 1964. The site was designated a Texas State Historic Landmark in 1962, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. On January 1, 2008, the house was transferred from the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department to the Texas Historical Commission. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2016. Today, visitors can tour Navarro's one-story limestone house ‚Äî a fine example of early-statehood domestic architecture ‚Äî read copies of his writing and discuss questions of history with informed staff. There is also a two-story square store and office building, noted for its bold quoins, which anchor the edges of the building's walls.

The park is adjacent to the Clason Point, Hunts Point, and Soundview neighborhoods, situated where the Bronx River flows into the East River, roughly opposite Rikers Island and LaGuardia Airport. The park is bounded by the Bronx River Estuary/East River, Lafayette Avenue, Morrison Avenue, Story Avenue, Metcalf Avenue, O'Brien Avenue, and Bronx River Avenue. Soundview Park is equipped with playgrounds, running tracks, sports fields, basketball and handball courts, outdoor fitness equipment, and kayak/canoe launching sites along the Bronx River Estuary. A bicycle path runs through the park from Bronx River and Lafayette Avenues to Leland and O'Brien Avenues. Soundview Park is operated by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. History Soundview Park was built on landfill over intertidal marshland under Parks Commissioner Robert Moses during the administration of New York Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia. The first of the park were acquired by the City of New York in 1937. more were acquired along the water's edge in December 1939. Plans to dredge and fill the shoreline had been developed by Moses and Sanitation Commissioner William F. Carey in 1938, and the New York City Board of Estimate approved initial funding for the construction project at Sound View Park in March 1939. The area remained largely undeveloped until the 1950s, and adjacent land was used in 1947 for a New York City Housing Authority temporary housing project made up of 947 apartments in 473 quonset huts. One remaining Quonset Hut is still visible on the south side of Seward Avenue at Croes Avenue. Further, more permanent public and private housing projects were built adjacent to the park in the 1950s. In the summer of 1942, a strange gas that caused silver to tarnish and gave humans headaches and nausea was noticed in the Clason Point neighborhood.942\\"> Experts and residents initially suspected that the garbage in the landfill under the parkland had not been handled properly, but finally the cause was determined to be dumping of sulphur from a Consolidated Edison plant into nearby stagnant pools. Subsequent extensions of the park were made by purchase of adjacent land in 1952 and 1967, when the park reached its current size.

In this context, money is being sent in the opposite direction to today's usual usage of the term remittance, which means money that migrants send to their countries of origin. Definitions \\"Remittance man\\" is defined in The Canadian Encyclopedia as \\"a term once widely used, especially in the West before WWI, for an immigrant living in Canada on funds remitted by his family in England, usually to ensure that he would not return home and become a source of embarrassment.\\" The Oxford English Dictionary adds: \\"spec[ifically] one considered undesirable at home; also in extended use\\". \\"Remittance man\\" is first attested in 1874, as a colonial term. One of the citations is of T. S. Eliot's 1958 play The Elder Statesman, where the son of the title figure resists his father's attempts to find him a job: \\"Some sort of place where everyone would sneer at the fellow from London. The limey remittance man for whom a job was made.\\" The OED gives \\"remittancer\\" as another form; this stretches back to 1750. Analysis and examples Within Victorian British culture, a remittance man was usually the black sheep of an upper or middle-class family who was sent away (from the United Kingdom to the Empire), and paid to stay away. These men were generally of dissolute or drunken character, and may have been sent overseas after one or more disgraces at home. Historian Monica Rico describes in Nature's Noblemen: Transatlantic Masculinities and the Nineteenth-Century American West (2013) how the figure emerged in the 1880s: \\"Unable to succeed in Britain [...] the remittance man represented the utter failure of elite British masculinity to function in the modern world.\\" Where he was to go was a wide-open question. The British Empire offered wide-open spaces and possibilities of redemption in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and colonial parts of Africa; some thought the American West was also an appropriate destination. Rico concludes that \\"the remittance man, in his weakness, symbolized his culture's fear that British masculinity was imperiled both in Britain and abroad.\\" The Canadian West had its share of remittance men. Journalist Leroy Victor Kelly (1880‚Äì1956) wrote The range men: pioneer ranchers of Alberta (1913) to capture their stories. \\"To the ordinary Western [Canadian] mind, a remittance man was a rich Englishman who had proven a failure in his homeland and had been shipped into the raw land to kill himself in quiet or work out his regeneration if possible.\\" They were \\"everlasting sources of enjoyment and personal gain\\" for the tough ranchers and early colonists, \\"the natural butt of the cowboys' jokes\\". Remittance men were held in scorn by all, even \\"solid contempt\\", and were considered easy marks by conmen and tellers of tall tales. Some, however, won redemption by, for example, joining the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in the Yukon. Not all of these men were considered dissolute disgraces; some were simply younger sons of the English landed gentry or aristocracy, because until 1925, the law of primogeniture meant that the eldest son inherited the estate, leaving the others to find their own fortunes. In his profile of the Wet Mountain Valley surrounding Westcliffe, Colorado, author Morris Cafky wrote in 1966 that after the initial wave of settlers, > Other venturesome folk followed‚ÄîEnglishmen this time. They too took up > homesteads. Many of these newcomers were remittance men from prominent > British families, a state of affairs which caused some to dub the region > \\"The Valley of the Second Sons\\". For years, activities on many a valley > ranch or farm ground to a halt at precisely 4 p.m. so that all could partake > of high tea. (Presumably afternoon tea, as for the Englishmen, high tea meant the evening meal.) He went on to differentiate between this type and others who followed, \\"individuals who were more used to the saloon [bar] than the salon.\\" A University of Michigan professor of journalism drew on his Alberta childhood to write \\"Mr Langhorne: A Prairie Sketch\\", which begins: \\"The thing about a Remittance Man, of course, is that nobody ever knows for sure whether or not he is a Remittance Man.\\" He characterises them as locked into secrecy, including giving up their real name. The stipend, regular but not lavish, dooms them to eke out an existence: \\"The remittance naturally saps his energy and wilts his ambition, if any.\\" It isn't enough to set up a business, and so their fates are sealed. As the New York Times headline put it in 1914, with reference to mining camps, \\"Where 'Remittance Men' Abound; Most Americans of That Ilk Work, but English Don't.\\" Low Life: Lures and Snares of Old New York (1991) documents the life and politics of lower Manhattan from the mid-19th century to the early 20th century. Luc Sante describes the hoboes and flophouses of the first fifteen years of the 20th century: \\"Among the tramps and bums were enigmatic sorts and instant legends. There were said to be Oxford graduates and men with dueling scars from German universities. There were remittance men from old families whose month would follow a rigorously determined cycle: Funds would arrive, followed by new clothes and feasting and carousing; then the money would be gone, the clothes would be pawned, and there would follow a week or two of utter destitution, each stage accompanied by a corresponding shift of lodging.\\" This binge-and-starve cycle was remarked on in Antipodean Notes (1888) by the British traveller Elim Henry D'Avignor. The term can be used to refer to an eccentric person, the town character. Remittance women Ella Higginson There were also \\"remittance women\\" but they are rarely discussed in scholarly works. A few examples include Bertha E. Kyte Reynolds, who lived in a tent outside Banff in the Rocky Mountains in the early 1900s, until an Anglican clergyman persuaded her relatives to increase her allowance, and Jessie de Prado MacMillan, a Scottish woman who homesteaded in New Mexico from about 1903. Ella Higginson, poet laureate of Washington state, applied some poetic licence to the story of royal scandal publicised by Edward Mylius. The case that went to trial concerned an alleged secret marriage in 1890 between the young naval officer who was to become George V, and a daughter of Admiral Sir Michael Culme-Seymour, 3rd Baronet. As Higgison tells it, in Alaska: The Great Country (1909), when the young royal had to renounce this marriage, his beloved was given the most royal of exiles: near the City of Vancouver \\"in the western solitude, lived for several years‚Äîthe veriest remittance woman‚Äîthe girl who should now, by the right of love and honor, be the Princess of Wales, and whose infant daughter should have been the heir to the throne.\\" The New Yorker in 1979 referred to Lady Blanche Hozier, mother of Clementine Churchill, by this term: in \\"Dieppe, a traditional escape route for English who have been exiled for one reason or another, [...] she gracefully lived the life of a remittance woman, gambled obsessively at the casino, and established a little salon\\". Popular representations (literature, film, and so on) The remittance man was a recognisable type in literature of the period, especially in Britain, Canada, and Australia. Rudyard Kipling writes repeatedly about remittance men and their brothers-in-arms, the gentleman rankers, men whose birth and station would otherwise usually lead to their commission as officers but who instead enlisted as a common soldier. A remittance man appears as a tragic figure in his New Zealand story \\"One Lady at Wairakei\\" (1891). Jack Buckland The 1892 novel The Wrecker, written by Robert Louis Stevenson and his stepson Lloyd Osbourne, is a \\"South Sea yarn\\" featuring a \\"remittance man\\". In the book Tommy is based on Jack Buckland (born 1864, Sydney; died 1897, Suwarrow Island), the handsome, happy-go-lucky, fellow cabin passenger on the 1890 Janet Nicholl voyage.The Cruise of the Janet Nichol among the South Sea Islands A Diary by Mrs Robert Louis Stevenson (first published 1914), republished 2004, editor, Roslyn Jolly (U. of Washington Press/U. of New South Wales Press)Robert Louis Stevenson: A Critical Biography, 2 vols.

S. and his Friends Some Stevenson Memories\\". New Zealand Railways Magazine, 12(2):59‚Äì61. In Following the Equator (1897), Mark Twain's travelogue presented as non-fiction, he describes the first remittance men he met. One was a hopeless alcoholic, \\"the most interesting and felicitous talker\\"; another on the same ship was only 19 or 20, but already \\"a good deal of a ruin\\". Also in 1897, Hilda Stafford and The Remittance Man, a pair of novellas set in California, were published by Beatrice Harraden. The remittance man in question can only reach mature adulthood when the money from home is stopped. Canadian poet Robert Service included \\"The Rhyme of the Remittance Man\\", which shares its meter and most of its rhyme scheme with Kipling's similarly-themed 1892 \\"Gentlemen-Rankers\\", in his 1907 anthology Songs of a Sourdough, published in the US as The Spell of the Yukon and Other Verses): > Far away, so faint and far, is flaming London, fevered Paris, :That I fancy > I have gained another star; Far away the din and hurry, far away the sin and > worry, :Far away‚ÄîGod knows they cannot be too far. Gilded galley-slaves of > Mammon‚Äîhow my purse-proud brothers taunt me! :I might have been as well-to- > do as they Had I clutched like them my chances, learned their wisdom, > crushed my fancies, :Starved my soul and gone to business every day. William Henry Pope Jarvis (1876‚Äì1944), described in The Oxford Companion to Canadian Literature as a journalist born in Prince Edward Island, wrote the epistolary novel The Letters of a Remittance Man to his Mother (1908, John Murray). The Remittance Woman was a 1923 silent film, featuring Ethel Clayton and directed by Wesley Ruggles. The following year a book of the same title appeared, by American pulp author Achmed Abdullah. In Brideshead Revisited, Sebastian Flyte is thus referred to by the British Consul to Charles Ryder on the latter's visit to Morocco during his unsuccessful attempt at bringing his alcoholic friend home to see his dying mother. > This is no place for a remittance man. The French [i.e. the colonial > authorities] don't understand him at all. They think everyone who's not > engaged in trade is a spy. It's not as though he lived like a Milord. Australian poet Judith Wright (1915‚Äì2000) included \\"Remittance Man\\" in her first collection, The Moving Image (1946). It begins: > The spendthrift, disinherited and graceless, accepted his pittance with an > easy air, only surprised he could escape so simply from the pheasant- > shooting and the aunts in the close One of Stephen Marlowe's recurring characters (c. 1960) is Andrea Hartshorn, who describes her situation thus: \\"Robbie is a remittance man. I'm a remittance woman. We're paid a monthly stipend to keep out of the family's hair. Remittance men. The polite word is expatriate.\\" Prince Yakimov, an Englishman of noble Russian descent, is a character in Olivia Manning's The Great Fortune. Yakimov is always \\"waiting for his remittance\\" as he sponges off the expatriate community in wartime Bucharest. Tom Wolfe, in The Bonfire of the Vanities, uses the term to refer to a wealthy Englishman's good-for- nothing daughters who spend their days on the New York City party circuit.  In popular culture  Jimmy Buffett wrote a song entitled \\"Remittance Man\\" for his album Barometer Soup. Buffett took inspiration from Mark Twain's description of meeting two remittance men during his voyage in \\"Following the Equator\\". TV Tropes describes the remittance man: > In Westerns, he's often connected somehow to the Cattle Baron; he may be the > money-man or at least represent \\"the money\\", or be the \\"manager\\". Could also > be a drunken wastrel with no visible means of support. In Canadian versions > of the Old West he might be the local Mountie or the local criminal. [...] > Usually only appears in fairly realistic Westerns, except in Canadian > versions where he's a stock character. [...] Sometimes in other settings > (like the South Pacific) where any European is likely an outcast, with many > of the same tropes still applying.

Teaming with reporter Ying Chan, he co-wrote an article on 25 October reporting that Liu Tai-ying, the business manager of Taiwan's Kuomintang political party, had offered $15 million to US President Bill Clinton's re-election campaign. The article also printed a denial from Liu that he had offered the money. Liu went on to file a criminal libel suit against the pair on 7 November. Chen Chao-ping, a political consultant named as the source of the story, was added as a co-defendant. Liu also filed a civil suit for $15 million in damages. Yazhou Zhoukan defended its reporters and refused to settle the suit outside of court. Calling the trial \\"a test case for press freedom in Asia\\", The Committee to Protect Journalists filed an amicus brief on the pair's behalf, as did ten major US media companies.

Zahl. Photographer: Mr Finne Trade seat of Kjerring√∏y. Photographer: Harald Groven Erasmus Benedicter (Benedigt) Kjerschow (Kjerskov) Zahl (19 January 1826 ‚Äì 29 April 1900) was a privileged trader and an island owner at Kjerring√∏y in Nordland, Norway. Zahl is known as Nobel Literature Prize laureate Knut Hamsun's monetary supporter, and a representative of the old, traditional Nordland‚ÄîHamsun's ideal society. He is also internationally known through the character Mack, who appears in several works of Hamsun, among them Pan (1894), Dreamers (1904), and Benoni and Rosa (1908).Knut Hamsun ‚Äì utdypning in Store norske leksikon.  History  = Tradesman's son in Nordvika = Erasmus Zahl was born in 1826 in Nordvika in D√∏nna, where his father Hans Hansen Zahl was a tradesman. His paternal grandparents were tradesman Hans Olsen Zahl and Anne Margrethe, n√©e Zahl in Nordvika. His mother was Anne Sophie Samuelsdatter Budde, a daughter of priest Lord Samuel Jensen Budde and Nicoline Marie Nicolaisdatter Tombsen. = Tradesman in Kjerring√∏y = In 1840-50, Erasmus Zahl came to Kjerring√∏y, where he met and married tradesman Jens Nicolai Ellingsen's widow, Anna Elisabeth n√©e Sverdrup. Thereby, he became the owner of Kjerring√∏y. It was during Zahl's time in Kjerring√∏y that the trade seat reached its ultimate wealth. Many economically good years, hereunder the herring fishery between 1865 and 1876, led to Zahl increasing his fortune with 156,000 speciedaler to 265,000 speciedaler. Anna Ellingsen Zahl died in 1879, after she, at the age of 78 years, fell down one of the main building's stairs. As a widower, Zahl introduced several changes at the trade seat. All sale of alcohol was ended, and nor should alcohol be enjoyed together with meals. Zahl let today's church in Kjerring√∏y be built, finished in 1883. Erasmus Zahl died in 1900 of apoplectic stroke. He had no children.  Mack  In the late 1800s, Erasmus Zahl gave monetary support to Knut Hamsun as a young and poor author. Later, 1920 Nobel Literature Prize laureate Hamsun used Zahl as a model for the character Mack appearing in many of his novels, among others Pan (1894), Dreamers (1904), and Benoni and Rosa (1908). The society in Nordland went through major changes during the late 1800s and the early 1900s. Traditions were challenged by modern ideas, and the social hierarchy, in which Zahl had a leading position, would gradually be changed due to factors like industrialisation and urbanisation. Hamsun was, as expressed in his literature, a defender of this old society. For example, in the double novel Benoni and Rosa, Hamsun describes the self-made man of the people Benoni Hartvigsen with ironical distance but at the same time also with considerable sympathy.Citation: [...] dobbeltromanen Benoni og Rosa fra 1908. I skikkelse av oppkomlingen BenoniHartvigsen tegner Hamsun her for f√∏rste gang et portrett av en allmuens mann i full skikkelse, med ironisk distanse, men ogs√• med betydelig sympati.

The play premiered Off- Broadway in January 2011 and transferred to Broadway in November 2011, marking the Broadway debut of a Baitz play. The play was a finalist for the 2012 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Other Desert Cities involves a family with differing political views and a long-held family secret.  Plot  The namesake of the play's title is the \\"other Desert Cities\\" freeway sign (center) along eastbound Interstate 10 near the Coachella Valley The play's name refers to a control city guide sign on eastbound Interstate 10 in California, which indicates that the freeway is headed towards Indio, California, and \\"other Desert Cities\\" (that is, the rest of the Coachella Valley and onward towards Phoenix, Arizona). The play's events occur around Christmas Eve 2004, when the family of Polly and Lyman Wyeth gather in Palm Springs, California. Their daughter Brooke Wyeth returns home after six years in New York writing magazine pieces. Polly's sister Silda is also visiting, out of a time spent in rehab. Polly and Lyman are Republicans, while Silda is a liberal who has fallen into alcoholism. The sisters co-wrote a series of MGM comedies in the 1960s, but have since become estranged chiefly due to Silda's resenting Polly for shifting social worldviews over time. Brooke announces and presents to her family a memoir recounting a pivotal and tragic event in the family's history: the suicide of her late brother Henry, who had been involved with the radical underground subculture in Venice, and a horrific incident resulting from their advocacy. During the course of the story, Brooke experiences bitter conflict between her yearning for independent understanding and reliance, and her parents' doting yet secretive motives towards her. During this, she also comes to terms with her family's sorrowing frustration in dealing with her post- divorce depressive episode, even years after Henry's disappearance. Nonetheless, after absorbing the family's perspectives, Brooke insists the memoir is vital for her continuing on in life, whether her family continues to embrace her or not. In an act of submission from Lyman, he and Polly finally recount the specifics surrounding the recruitment center bombing Henry was implicated in, after years of personal clashes and rejection from both parents and son. Henry showed up disheveled, begging for help and insisting he was unaware of his friends' terrorism. When Lyman insisted Henry turn himself in nonetheless, another argument broke out and Lyman slapped him. Henry disappeared into the night, and wasn't found until three weeks later by Polly. She reveals that she made an interstate trip with Lyman and her son to the northern border, and the ferry he disappeared from. But Lyman painfully reveals they had also doctored Henry's suicide note themselves, and stuck it in his shoes with a tearful goodbye. With their darkest secret unearthed, Lyman and Polly come to terms with their grief, and give Brooke their consent for publishing. Brooke, in the play's penultimate moment, launches all the pages of her memoir into the air in anguish, screaming of her internal suffering since Henry left her life, and trying to spare her parents the potential pain of her suicide despite her continual grief. Lyman embraces his daughter in remorse. An epilogue reveals Brooke at her memoir's publishing...years after Polly and Lyman's passing, per their initial request. She recounts a memory of her brother, wondering when she will see him again.  Productions  The play was originally titled Love and Mercy.

In collaboration with her colleagues, Artemy Malkov and Andrey Korotayev, she has shown that till the 1970s the hyperbolic growth of the world population was accompanied by quadratic-hyperbolic growth of the world GDP, and developed a number of mathematical models describing both this phenomenon, and the World System withdrawal from the blow-up regime observed in the recent decades. The hyperbolic growth of the world population and quadratic-hyperbolic growth of the world GDP observed till the 1970s have been correlated by him and his colleagues to a non-linear second order positive feedback between the demographic growth and technological development that can be spelled out as follows: technological growth ‚Äì increase in the carrying capacity of land for people ‚Äì demographic growth ‚Äì more people ‚Äì more potential inventors ‚Äì acceleration of technological growth ‚Äì accelerating growth of the carrying capacity ‚Äì the faster population growth ‚Äì accelerating growth of the number of potential inventors ‚Äì faster technological growth ‚Äì hence, the faster growth of the Earth's carrying capacity for people, and so on.See, e.g., Introduction to Social Macrodynamics: Compact Macromodels of the World System Growth.

They have demonstrated that post-Soviet Russia experiences one of the world's highest prevalence of alcohol-related problems, which contributes to high mortality rates in this region. Reduction in alcohol-related problems in Russia can have strong effects on mortality decline. They have analyzed the plausibility of application of general principles of alcohol policy translated in the Russian Federation. Khaltourina has shown that alcohol policy approaches could be implemented in the same ways as they have been in other countries. In addition, according to Khaltourina, there should be special attention to decreasing distilled spirits consumption, illegal alcohol production, nonbeverage alcohol consumption, and enforcement of current governmental regulations.See, e.g., Russian Demographic Crisis in Cross-National Perspective.

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1714884114  Literacy and the Spirit of Capitalism  Khaltourina and her colleagues have demonstrated that Protestantism has indeed influenced positively the capitalist development of respective social systems not so much through the \\"Protestant ethics\\" (as was suggested by Max Weber) but rather through the promotion of literacy.Korotayev A., Malkov A., Khaltourina D. (2006), Introduction to Social Macrodynamics, Moscow: URSS, (Chapter 6: Reconsidering Weber: Literacy and \\"the Spirit of Capitalism\\"). P.87-91. 150px They draw attention to the fact that the ability to read was essential for Protestants (unlike Catholics) to perform their religious duty ‚àí to read the Bible. The reading of Holy Scripture was not necessary for Catholic laymen. The edict of the Toulouse Synod (1229) prohibited the Catholic laymen from possessing copies of the Bible. Soon after that, a decision by the Tarragon Synod spread this prohibition to ecclesiastic people as well. In 1408, the Oxford Synod absolutely prohibited translations of the Holy Scripture. From the very beginning, Protestant groups did not accept this prohibition. Thus, Luther translated in 1522‚Äì1534 first the New Testament, and then the Old Testament, into German, so that any German-speaking person could read the Holy Scripture in his or her native language. Moreover, the Protestants viewed reading the Holy Scripture as a religious duty of any Christian. As a result, the level of literacy and education was, in general, higher for Protestants than it was for Catholics and for followers of other confessions that did not provide religious stimuli for learning literacy. It has been shown that literate populations have many more opportunities to obtain and utilize the achievements of modernization than illiterate ones. On the other hand, literate people could be characterized by a greater innovative-activity level, which provides opportunities for modernization, development, and economic growth. Empirical tests performed by Korotayev and his colleagues have confirmed the presence of a rather strong and highly significant correlation between the early introduction of mass literacy and subsequent high rates of capitalist economic development.Korotayev A., Malkov A., Khaltourina D.

(1989) Federal Information Policy Development: The Congressional perspective. In C. McClure, P. Hernon and H. Relyea (eds), United States Government Information Policies: views and Perspectives (Ablex, Norwood, NJ). It thus encompasses any other decision-making practice with society-wide constitutive efforts that involve the flow of information and how it is processed.Braman, S. (2011). Defining information policy. Journal of Information Policy 1-5. http://jip.vmhost.psu.edu/ojs/index.php/jip/article/view/19/14 . There are several fundamental issues that comprise information policy. Most prominent are public policy issues concerned with the use of information for democratization and commercialization of social life. These issues include, inter alia, digital environment, such as the digital divide, intellectual property, economic regulations, freedom of expression, confidentiality or privacy of information, information security, access management, and regulating how the dissemination of public information occurs. Certain categories of information are of particular importance for information policy. These include news information, health information, and census information. Information policy is the central problem for information societies. As nations make the transition from industrialism to post-industrialism, information issues become increasingly critical. According to sociologist Daniel Bell, \\"what counts now is not raw muscle power or energy but information\\" (Daniel Bell, The Coming of Post-Industrial Society, 1973, p. 37). While all societies have been to some extent based on information, information societies are almost wholly dependent on computerized information. As Marc Uri Porat, the first researcher to use the term \\"information policy\\", wrote: \\"The foundation of the information economy, our new central fact, is the computer. Its ability to manipulate and process information represents a profound departure from our modest human abilities\\". The computer's combination with telecommunications, he continued, posed \\"the policy problems of the future\\". (Marc Uri Porat, The Information Economy, 1976, p. 205.)  Overview  Information policy became a prominent field of study during the latter half of the 20th century as the shift from an industrial to an information society transpired. It has since then evolved from being seen as relatively unimportant to having a much more overarching strategic significance since it establishes the conditions ‚Äúunder which all other decision making, public discourse, and political activity occur.‚Äù The growing awareness in the importance of information policy has sparked an interest in various groups to further study and analyze its magnitude. The most common audience for information policy analysis includes undergraduate and graduate students, scholars, policymakers, policy analysts, as well as those members of the public who have taken an interest in understanding the effects of the laws and regulations involving information. Although information policy generally has a broader definition and encapsulates a multitude of components, its scope and impact can vary depending on the context. For example, in the context of an information lifecycle, information policy refers to the laws and policies that deal with the stages information goes through beginning with its creation, through its collection, organization, dissemination, and finally to its destruction.Mason, Marilyn Gell. (1983). The federal role in library and information services. White Plains, N.Y.: Knowledge Industry Publishers Inc. On the other hand, in the context of public administration, information policy is the means by which government employees, institutions, and information systems adapt themselves to an environment in rapid fluctuation and use information for decision-making (e.g., Andersen and Dawes, 1991; also see Bozeman and Bretschneider, 1986, and Stevens and McGowan, 1985). One can see how these two contexts offer varying scopes for the phrase ‚Äú information policy.‚Äù Information policy is in fact, a combination of several varying disciplines including information science, economics, law, and public policy. Thus, its scope may differ when each of these disciplines analyses or uses it. The information sciences may be more concerned with technical advances and how this impacts information policy, while from a law perspective, issues such as privacy rights and intellectual property may be of greatest focus.Hill, M. W. (1995) Information Policies: premonitions and prospects. Journal of Information Science 21(4) 273-282.  History The earliest sight of information policy was present around the mid-1900s. The stages to begin evolving from an industrial society to an information society sparked several other transformations. The common industrial technologies were beginning to be replaced by informational meta-technologies. Organizations began changing their form, several new architectures of knowledge developed, and most importantly, the information economy replaced industrial and agricultural economies. By the 1970s, the concept of national information policy was created to protect the data and information that was used in creating public policies. The earliest adopters of information policy included the United States, Australia, as well as several European countries who all recognized the importance for a more standardized governance of information. Elizabeth Orna contributed to a paper on information policies by providing a brief history of the development of ideas surrounding national and organizational information policies, from the beginning when the United Kingdom Ministry of Information was established in the First World War to present day. The history of information policy is reflected in this chart. In the 20th century, to cope with the privacy problems of databases, information policy evolved further safeguards. In the US, the federal Privacy Act provides individuals the right to inspect and correct personal information in federal datafiles.  Types and importance  The types of information policy can be separated into two different categories. It can be discussed in the short-term focus exclusively on information science. It can also have a much broader context in relation to different subjects and be within a larger time period, for example dating back to Roman civilization, the Bill of Rights, or the Constitution. The obvious reason for the need of information policy deals with the legal issues that can be associated with the advancement of technology. More precisely,‚Äîthe digitization of the cultural content made the cost of the copy decreasing to nearly zero and increased the illegal exchange of files, online, via sharing web site or P2P technologies, or off line (copy of hard disks). As a result, there are many grey areas between what users can and cannot do, and this creates the need for some sort of regulation. Today, this has led to the creation of SOPA (Stop Online Piracy Act). Information policy will mark the boundaries needed to evaluate certain issues dealing with the creation, processing, exchange, access, and use of information. 1\\\\. for avoiding risks (financial losses from incomplete and uncoordinated exploitation of information, wasted time, failures of innovation, and reputation loss); 2\\\\. for positive benefits, including negotiation and openness among those responsible for different aspects of information management 3\\\\. productive use of IT in supporting staff in their use of information 4\\\\. ability to initiate change to take advantage of changing environments  Issues  There are some issues around organizational information policies,Orna Elizabeth, Information Policies, yesterday, today and tomorrow, Journal of Information Science, 34 (4) 2008, pp 547-565, apud N. Moore and J. Steel, Information-Intensive Britain. British Library R & D report No. 6038 (The Policy Studies Institute/British Library Board, London, 1991). which are the interaction between human beings and technology for using information, the issue to proceed information policy itself, whether top-down or middle-up-down, is the best way to approach information policy in an organization. Also, issues that information tends to be influenced by organization's culture that result in complexity of information flow. Moreover, the concern about valuing information is discussed by Orna, the fact that value of information is dependent on the user, and it can't be measured by price. Considering that information is an asset or intellectual capital that becomes valuable when it is used in productive ways.  Convergence Convergence essentially combines all forms of media, telecommunications, broadcasting, and computing by the use of a single technology: digital computers.(Garcia-Murillo and MacInnes, 2002) It integrates diverse technological systems in the hopes of improving performance of similar tasks. Convergence is thought to be the result of the need for expansion into new markets due to competition and technological advances that have created a threat of new entrants into various segments of the value chain. As a result, previously disparate technologies interact with one other synergistically to deliver information in new and unique ways and allow for inventive solutions to be developed. Nearly every innovative trend in the social industry involves adding data or layers of connectivity.(Stanchak, 2010) Social networking sites have begun interacting with e-mail functionalities, search engines have begun integrating Internet searches with Facebook data, Twitter along with various other social media platforms have started to play a prominent role in the emergency management framework (mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery) among several others. In 2012 a prominent issue arose that deals with the convergence of social media with copyright infringement monitoring systems.(Reisinger, 2012) The growing interest in this topic can be largely attributed to the recent anti-piracy bills: the Stop Online Piracy Act and the PROTECT IP Act. Various officials from all over the world have expressed an interest in forcing social networks to install and utilize monitoring systems to determine if users are illegally obtaining copyrighted material. For example, if implemented, these filters could prevent the illegal sharing of music over social networking platforms. The convergence of search engines and social networks could make this process even easier. Search engines such as Google, Yahoo, and Bing have begun to merge with social media platforms to link Internet searches to your social networking sites such as Facebook.(Houck, 2012) This poses an even greater threat to users since their Internet searches can be monitored via their social networks. The issue of converging social networks with piracy monitoring systems becomes controversial when it comes to protecting personal data and abiding by privacy laws. In order for a synergy such as this one to take place, regulatory convergence would need to be considered. Regulatory convergence is the merging of previously disparate industry-based laws and regulations into a single legal and regulatory framework.  Internet governance  Internet governance has both narrow and broad definitions, thus, making it a complex concept to understand. When most people think of Internet governance, they think of the regulations of the content and conduct that are communicated and acted on through the Internet.Solum, 2008, p. 50 Although this is certainly a broad component of Internet governance, additionally, there are more narrow elements to the definition that are often overlooked. Internet governance also encompasses the regulation of Internet infrastructure and the processes, systems, and institutions that regulate the fundamental systems that determine the capabilities of the Internet. Architecture is the foundation of the Internet. The fundamental goal of the Internet architecture is to essentially create a network of networks by interconnecting various computer network systems globally.(Solum, 2008, 68) Protocols such as TCP/IP as well as other network protocols serve as the rules and conventions by which computers can communicate with each other.(Solum, 2008, 67) Thus, TCP/IP is often viewed as the most important institution of Internet governance. It serves as the backbone to network connectivity. Organizations such as the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) coordinate the various systems within the Internet on a global level to help preserve the operational stability of the Internet.(Solum, 2008, 48) For example, coordination of IP addresses and managing the Domain Name System (DNS) ensure computers and devices can correctly connect to the Internet and can communicate effectively globally. If regulation of these crucial elements of the Internet such as TCP/IP and DNS were governed by disparate principles, the Internet would no longer exist as it does today. Networks, computers, and peripherals would not be able to communicate and have the same accessibility if these foundational elements varied.  Government roles  Like with any policy, there needs to be an agent to govern and regulate it. With information policy in a broader sense, the government has several roles and responsibilities. Some examples include providing accurate information, producing and maintaining information that meets the specific needs of the public, protecting the privacy and confidentiality of personal and sensitive information, and making informed decisions on which information should be disseminated and how to distribute it effectively, among others.Browne, M. (1997) The Field of Information Policy: 1. Fundamental Concepts, Journal of Information Science 23(4) 261-275 Although the government plays an active role in information policy, the analysis of information policy should not only include the formal decision making processes by government entities, but also the formal and informal decisions of both the private and public sector of governance. = Security vs freedom of information = A persistent debate concerning the government role in information policy is the separation of security and freedom of information. Legislation such as the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USAPATRIOT or USAPA) Act of 2001 is an example of security taking precedence over civil liberties. The USAPA affected several surveillance and privacy laws to include: * Wire Tapping (Title III) which requires there be probable cause for real-time interception of voice and data communication. * Electronic Communications Privacy Act(ECPA) regulates government access to email and other electronic communications. * Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) authorizes the government to carry out electronic surveillance against any person, including Americans. The USAPA was passed in October 2001, not long after 9/11 and without much contention from congress. Civil liberties advocates argue that the changes made to the standing surveillance laws were done in an abrupt manner and without consideration to basic rights as outlined in the US constitution, specifically fourth amendment rights which protects against unreasonable search and seizure.  Research methods and tools  The five broad methodological strands that Rowlands (1996) identified are current tools for information policy study: Classification: The tool demonstrates a wide range of issues and subjects on information policy. It helps research to understand the breadth of the subject. The published materials are reasonably well documented and described. It is also good for start-up literature review and research purposes. Identification of policy issues and options: This tool relies on inputs for information; for example, interviews and questionnaires targeting policy makers and other stakeholders. It is a commonly used in the studies of on-the-job policy makers in government or industry (Moore and Steele, 1991; McIntosh, 1990; Rowlands, 1997). Reductionism: The reductionist approach control factors to reduce ambiguity. The factors include constraining data collection, analysis and interpretation within the framework of a specific discipline. It helps researchers to notice how a specific factor relates to the overall environment. Forecasting and scenario-building: The commonly used model is STEEP framework. It helps in reducing uncertainties for a topic that is under studies. Process-oriented research and cases studies: It provides detailed contextual analyses of particular events. It helps researcher to experience the policy process in semi-real situation and study its outcome.  The future  In regard to the future of information policy, it should be flexible and changing to different circumstances as the ability to access, store, and share information grows.Galvin, T.J. (1994). Rights in Conflict: public policy in an information age. In: New Worlds in Information and Documentation : Proceedings of the 46th FID Conference and Congress Galvin suggests that information policy might include setting a boundary to the uncertainty in this field. As information policy becomes a larger and more important topic, it will also become a greater subject to governmental regulation in regards to the future of technology as well. It will also include the studies of these subjects: information science, communications, library science, and technology studies. The information policies will earn more advantages for national and organizational, such as getting the best from development of Web 2.0 nationally and in organization, influence people for paying attention to the socio aspect and socio-technical system, for securing preservation of digital content, bringing out information product, also respecting all users and making thinking time respectable. In order to achieve this national organization, it will be important to focus not only on a domestic level but also nationally. Making domestic agencies cooperate internationally (and vice versa) though, will not be overly successful. A single nation can take the lead in establishing communication-based relationships specifically regarding the internet. These relations will need to be slowly and consistently established in order to truly unify any kind of information policy and decision-making. If information policy can be established and guided on a semi-national level, the degree of communication and cooperation throughout the world will increase dramatically. As information policy continues to shape many aspects of society, these international relations will become vital (Harpham, 2011). Information policy is playing a greater role in the economy leading to the production of goods and services, as well as selling them directly to consumers (UCLA, 2009). The cost of information varies from a tangible good in that initial costs of the first unit are large and fixed; however, after that, marginal costs are relatively low (MacInnes, 2011). As an increase from the information services, information can be paralleled to that of manufacturing several years ago (UCLA, 2009). The digitalization of information allows businesses to make better justified business decisions (MacInnes, 2011).

Lake Avio was previously completed in 1929 and Lake Benedetto completed in 1940. Design and operation Lake Benedetto in foreground, Lake Avio in background The lower reservoir is located in Edolo on the north bank of the Oglio.

Both the Avio and Benedetto Dams are gravity dams and are and in height, respectively. The total storage capacity of the upper reservoir (including Lake Benedetto) is of which can be used for power generation. The elevation of Lake Avio is above sea level and it traps water from a catchment area. Connecting the upper and lower reservoirs is a series of tunnels and pipes. Beginning at Lake Avio's intake, an long head-race tunnel transfers water east before it bifurcates into two long penstocks. Each penstock reaches the power plant and splits further to supply the eight pump- generators with water. The lower reservoir and power plant are connected by two long tunnels. The difference in elevation between both reservoirs affords a hydraulic head of . At the power station, each Francis pump-turbine- generator is rated at 125 MW for power generation and 140 MW for pumping. Only seven of the pump-generators can operate at one time. When energy demand is low and electricity cheap, the plant pumps water from the lower reservoir to the upper. When demand is high, that water, being stored energy, is released back down the same tunnels and pipes to the plant for generation. After being used for generation, the power plant sends the water back to the lower reservoir. New water reserves can also be taken from the Oglio River. This process repeats as needed and allows the plant to serve as a peaking power plant. The plant generates 737 GWh annually but consumes 1,021 GWh pumping. Although it consumes more energy than it creates, pumping occurs at night, when electricity is cheap. This makes to plant economical as it is generating electricity during high demand, more expensive periods. The size of the Avio Dam's catchment area allows it to collect water naturally as well and 219 GWh can be generated from this water alone annually.

They currently serve throughout France and Africa. According to their current Superior General, Sister Dani√®le, their service consists of \\"serving the Sacred Heart of Jesus through responding to the needs of world wherever they find themselves.\\"Paroisse de Saint-Symphorien de Versailles Foundation The congregation was founded by the Servant of God, Abb√© Peter-Victor Braun, in Paris in 1866.\\"Sacred Heart, Sister Servants of the\\", St. Bede's College, Mentone, Victoria Braun, who was a native of Saint-Avold in the Lorraine region, had moved there to meet the spiritual needs of the German-speaking people of his region who were flocking from the farms to the capital at the height of the Industrial Revolution in France to find work. He became a regular confessor at the famed Basilica of Our Lady of Victories in Paris. In the course of his ministry, Braun also served in a seedy quarter of the city where he became aware of the struggle of the young women there who had come as unskilled workers, especially when they were not able to find work in the factories. He also saw single mothers struggling to survive with their children. With the help of a small group of volunteers he opened a hostel where the young women could find a refuge and place of support. He also opened a day care center so that mothers could find employment by which they could support their families. Additionally home visits were done by his volunteer ladies to the residences of the sick poor to care for them in their need. By October 1866, Braun had reluctantly concluded that the work had to be entrusted to a congregation of professed Religious Sisters in order to guarantee its continuity. Thus he established three of these volunteers under the leadership of a Bavarian woman, Anna Katherina Berger, as a religious congregation. Berger had come to Paris already a member of a community of Franciscan Sisters in Pirmasens, founded by the Blessed Paul Joseph Nardini. She was appointed as Mother Superior of the small community by Braun, under the name of Mother Mary Odilia. The Rule was adapted from that of Francis de Sales. Revolution and exile The sudden outbreak of the Franco- Prussian War in 1870 caused a major change in the future of the small congregation. Rumors of anti-Catholic atrocities by the Paris Commune caused a group of the Sisters to flee to England for safety. They were followed by a larger group, who brought with them Braun, who was suffering from shock resulting from his ministry at the battlefront. Because of her nationality, the co-founder, Mother Odilia, was forced to return to her native Germany.Berger initially settled in the Rhineland, where she attempted to found a new community along the same lines. Thwarted by government policies of the period, she emigrated to the United States, winding up in St. Louis, Missouri, where she founded the Sisters of St. Mary, now the Franciscan Sisters of Mary. The refugees were warmly received by Cardinal Henry Edward Manning, the Archbishop of Westminster, who gave them a small house in the Stratford area of the city. The Sisters quickly established themselves in the East End of London where they began again their mission of helping struggling workers and their families. They also established a hospital. The Sisters Servants of the Sacred Heart of Jesus Congregation Re-established in France After the upheavals of the Franco-Prussian War and the subsequent uprisings, with the establishment of peace in France by the late 1870s, some of the French Sisters returned to Paris. They re-established the congregation there and its work. The Servants had been recognized in the Diocese of Versailles as a congregation in 1868 by the local bishop, Mgr. Jean-Pierre Mabile. Thus when Braun, their founder, died in 1882, in 1884 they chose to move their motherhouse to Versailles, where they arrived on Christmas Day. They soon established services to the needy and the mentally handicapped of the region. Braun's remains were transferred to the chapel of the Motherhouse in 1925.Paroisse After a generation, however, differences in vision began to emerge between the English and French Sisters. Under the advice of Cardinal Herbert Vaughan, in 1902 the majority of the Sisters in England elected to separate from the Servants of the Sacred Heart and to form a new congregation. They took the name of the Sisters of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary.Website of the Sisters of the Sacred Hearts \\"Beginnings\\" Today The Congregation today has several convents throughout France, such as in Argenteuil, Gennevilliers and Beaucaire. Additionally they serve in two nursing homes in the Department of Aveyron. They have a retreat house in Saint-Gervais. They have a mission in Mali and other African countries. The Sisters from Africa have their formation in Versailles, which serves as the novitiate of the congregation. In 2003 the Servants of the Sacred Heart formed the Federation of Victor Braun with its two daughter congregations, the English one and an Austrian one. This has been approved by the Holy See. The three congregations now share in several common ministries around the world.Paroisse Notes See also * Mary Odilia Berger * Sisters of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary Category:1866 establishments in France Category:Catholic female orders and societies Category:Catholic religious institutes established in the 19th century Category:Religious organizations established in 1866 ","title":"Sisters Servants of the Sacred Heart"},{"id":"34517409","text":"Dar Balut-e Olya (, also Romanized as DƒÅr Bal≈´≈£-e ‚ÄòOlyƒÅ; also known as DƒÅr Bal≈´≈£-e BƒÅlƒÅ) is a village in Beyranvand-e Shomali Rural District, Bayravand District, Khorramabad County, Lorestan Province, Iran.

Professional wrestling persona and style  When Fale first turned his back on Yuji Nagata and most of New Japan's fan favorites, he became known as The Underboss of Prince Devitt and Bullet Club, carrying Devitt to the ring. After a few years, Fale decided to embrace not being a low-key member of Bullet Club, re-naming his persona The Rogue General. Fale, being a larger wrestler has always utilized power-based moves in his arsenal. Being a villainous character, he uses his power to inflict more pain than necessary and to control the opponent's pace. Despite having the power (and at some times in his career, the athletic) advantage over most of his opponents, Fale's character has always tried to take the easy way out and cheat during matches.

She started work at age 18 for Swedex, and was dismissed in 2006 after ten years service. She argued that under the German Civil Code, BGB ¬ß622 (which was enacted in 1926, [34]) that she received only one month was discriminatory. She should have had four, were it not for the under-25 exception. After the Landesarbeitsgericht D√ºsseldorf referred the question, the government argued the aim was to give employers more flexibility by allowing them to dismiss young workers, who can be expected to be more personally and occupationally mobile. The questions were (1)(a) is an age qualification for provisions on reasonable notice discriminatory (b) are they justified (2) if unjustifiable, can private citizens have a direct right of action against employers? Judgment The European Court of Justice (Grand Chamber) held that the legislation was contrary to the Employment Equality Framework Directive 2000/78/EC, but also following Mangold v Helm a general principle of equality which permeates all of EU law, to which the Directive merely gave expression. This is more so because the Charter of Fundamental Rights article 21(1) says the same and that has the same legal value as the treaties under TEU art 6(1). Accordingly, in paragraphs [23]-[31], it was held that the legislation in BGB ¬ß622 was discriminatory. There was not a sufficient objective justification for the measure, because although the German government's professed aim of wishing to bolster youth employment was legitimate, its measure was disproportionate. In paragraphs [44]-[56] the ECJ further held that national courts have a duty to disapply any provision of national legislation contrary to the principle of equal treatment. They should not be compelled to make a reference to the ECJ first.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999, and demolished in 2008. History The replacement bridge During the 1910s, a road was developed through Iron County running from Dickinson County through Crystal Falls and Iron River and on to Gogebic County. Between Iron River and the county line, the road crossed three rivers: Cook's Run River, the Paint River and the Tamarack River. In 1915 the Michigan State Highway Department let out contracts to construct spans over each river; these bridges were designated Trunk Line Bridges 26, 27, and 28, respectively. Barnum and Counihan were awarded the contracts to build the bridges at Cook's Run and over the Tamarack River. The Tamarack River bridge was completed in 1916 at a cost of $2,826.10. The bridge was the last link in the trunk line route‚Äîthen known as the \\"Cloverland Trail\\"‚Äîand in July 1916 was the site of the formal dedication of the route. It was located near the Sans Souci flag railroad station on a Chicago and North Western line. In the 1920s the Cloverland Trail developed into US Highway 2, but by 1942 the segment crossing the Tamarack River had been realigned, and the old section re- designated as a Forest Road in the Ottawa National Forest. The Forest Route 157‚ÄìTamarack River Bridge carried vehicular traffic, and was in essentially unaltered condition, up until its demolition in the late 2000s. The bridge was technologically significant as one of the two oldest concrete girder bridges designed by the Michigan State Highway Department. Description The main span of the Forest Route 157‚ÄìTamarack River Bridge was long and wide, with a roadway width of . The bridge represented a standard 1915‚Äì16 Michigan State Highway Department design. The bridge consisted of two concrete girders resting on concrete abutments with angled wingwalls. The bridge was modestly detailed, with recessed rectangular panels on the outside walls and bronze \\"Trunk Line Bridge\\" plates (since removed) on the girders' inside walls.

The front of Downing Hall was set back with wings projecting forward on either side. On the south east side there was a prominent bay window with the family coat of arms above. On the front of the house was the Welsh motto \\"Heb Dduw, heb ddim, a Duw a digon\\" (without God, without anything; God and enough). When Thomas Pennant inherited the estate, he described the house as being \\"incapable of being improved into a magnitude exceeding the revenue of the family.\\" It pleased him because it was \\"a small house with a large garden.\\" Nevertheless, the house had some handsome rooms including a large hall, a parlour \\"capable of containing more guests than I ever wish to see in it at a time,\\" a library by well stocked with classical, historical and natural history books and a smoking-room \\"most antiquely furnished with ancient carvings, and the horns of all the European beasts of chase\\". 18th and 19th centuries Thomas Pennant inherited the house on the death of his father, David, in 1763. He refurbished the house, erected a new stable block and was probably responsible for creating the walled kitchen garden. He found the pleasure grounds badly neglected with the surrounding woods encroaching on the gardens and threw himself enthusiastically into improving them. He was helped in this by the discovery of a seam of lead on the estate which, when mined, brought in a useful income. He \\"laid open the natural beauties of the place\\", improved the scenery, created walkways, vistas and dingles and built a sunken passageway under the turnpike road. His son, David, who inherited the house in 1793, was also a keen gardener. He added the library wing and was responsible for the erection of productive glasshouses with vineries, a peach house, cucumber house and heated beds.The Kitchen Garden at Downing Hall The Potting Shed.

He did not live there most of the time, making his Warwickshire house, Newnham Paddox, his main residence.

Jack and Jason Schneider, Have Not Been the Same: The Can-Rock Renaissance 1985-1995. ECW Press. . Based in Montreal, the company both released albums directly as a label, and distributed albums on behalf of many other small independent labels, making it one of the largest and most influential Canadian record companies of the alternative rock era. By the mid-1990s, the company was so powerful that its decline toward bankruptcy between 1995 and 1997 initially appeared destined to set off a cascading failure of the entire Canadian music industry; however, these early predictions of disaster were averted as affected labels sought out new distribution arrangements. This period of retrenchment, in turn, has been credited with stabilizing the industry and in turn paving the way for the Canadian indie rock boom of the early 2000s. History The label was originally formed in 1987 by Eric Goodis, Randy Boyd and Phillip Hill, three former staffers at Bonaparte Records, an independent record store in Montreal. Boyd was also formerly a partner in the short-lived punk label Psyche Industry Records. Labels distributed in Canada by Cargo included both Canadian companies such as Mint Records, Murderecords and Sonic Unyon, and international labels such as Epitaph, Dischord, Taang!,\\"Bringing it All Back Home\\". Billboard, February 5, 1994. Restless, Amphetamine Reptile, Alias,\\"Campus Radio Brings Labels Back to School\\". Billboard, July 1, 1995. SST, Caroline, Ninja Tune and Sub Pop. Artists signed directly to Cargo's label arm included Shadowy Men on a Shadowy Planet,\\"Bankruptcy ends fairy tale for indie-music firm\\". The Gazette, January 26, 1998. Dyoxen, Change of Heart, Lost Dakotas, The Smalls, Nomeansno, The Killjoys, Asexuals, SNFU and Grimskunk; through its distribution deals, Cargo also held the Canadian rights to acts such as Mudhoney, Archers of Loaf, The Offspring, NOFX and Rancid, as well as to the earlier, pre-breakthrough albums by bands such as Nirvana, Green Day and Soundgarden. In 1993, the company signed an upstream distribution deal with MCA Records, giving it an expanded national distribution channel and in turn giving MCA access to buzz bands such as Sloan, Furnaceface, Me Mom and Morgentaler, The Snitches and The Hardship Post, who were signed to labels distributed by Cargo.\\"Something in the Way They Move: Fast-Acting Indies Now Industry's Prime A&R; Source\\". Billboard, February 5, 1994. The company's power reached its peak in 1995, when its existing contract as the Canadian distributor for Epitaph made it a significant beneficiary of the breakout success of The Offspring and Rancid. In that year, the company held a 2.3 per cent share of the music market in Canada, making it the second largest Canadian-owned music company behind only Quality Records; nonetheless, Cargo was considered more influential than Quality, as the latter was no longer distributing albums by individual artists and instead owed its market share entirely to MuchMusic-branded compilation albums.Michael Dorland, The cultural industries in Canada: problems, policies and prospects. James Lorimer & Co., 1996. . At its peak, the company also had distribution offices in San Diego, Chicago and London;\\"The Importance of Being Exported\\". Billboard, February 5, 1994. these offices operated as labels and distributors within their own countries ‚Äî artists who released material through Cargo's American division included Blink-182, Rocket from the Crypt, Drive Like Jehu and 7 Seconds ‚Äî as well as providing new international distribution channels for artists signed to or distributed by the Canadian office. Takeover and decline The company's success also made it a desirable takeover target. Businessmen Allen Fox and Paul Allen bought out Boyd's share of the company in 1994, and acquired Goodis' and Hill's shares in 1995, becoming the sole owners of the company. Under Fox and Allen's management, the company moved to lavish new offices, underwent a rapid staffing expansion, and began offering incentives to independent labels to gain exclusive vendor lock-in privileges over those labels' manufacturing and distribution. Goodis and Hill later told Billboard that they sold their shares after several months of sharp disagreement with Fox and Allen about the direction of the company; both felt that Fox and Allen actually knew very little about the music business, but instead merely seemed to view owning a record company, particularly one flush with cash from a recent pair of smash hit albums, as a ticket to fast wealth. The sale did not include the company's American or British offices; the American office became Cargo Music, a separate company headed by Goodis, while the British office became Cargo Records (UK), a separate company headed by Hill. Both of the spinoff companies were still in operation as of 2017. However, financial irregularities quickly began cropping up in Cargo's business dealings under Fox and Allen's management: some labels began to report that Cargo was making its own decisions about how many copies of an album to press without reporting back to the labels, often leaving the labels unable to square their accounts because of discrepancies between the number of copies they had ordered and the number that were actually sold and/or returned; many labels reported unpaid bills from Cargo that in turn left them unable to pay their bands; and some retail chains, including HMV, entirely ceased business dealings with Cargo due to the company's frequent delays in properly fulfilling orders. Mint Records suffered the highest-profile setback during this period when it lost Gob, then its most lucrative act, to Nettwerk because of Cargo's failure to pay Mint for sales of the band's album Too Late... No Friends. By the time it was clear that Cargo was likely headed toward bankruptcy, many labels began seeking out other arrangements. Sonic Unyon Records and Outside Music, notably, moved directly into distribution themselves, while other labels struck new distribution deals with Sonic Unyon, Outside, Koch International, Fusion III or other companies, in turn contributing to Cargo's decline; by 1997, the company had lost almost 75 per cent of its overall business.\\"Cargo Files for Bankruptcy\\". Billboard, January 24, 1998. Fox and Allen attributed the company's decline to alternative rock's commercial \\"bust\\" in 1996 and 1997, with unsold returns from record stores in those years soaring to a record 49 per cent of the company's shipped product; however, the company's former subsidiary in the United States experienced a similar rate of product return in the same era, yet survived this period of difficulty in part by closing its distribution office in Chicago and consolidating its operations in the California office.\\"Distributor Cargo Closing\\". Billboard, December 12, 1998. In 1996, Fox and Allen sought a deal which would have seen the company taken over by Tune 1000, a Quebec City-based music software company, but the deal fell through when Tune 1000's auditors discovered similar irregularities in Cargo's books. The company ultimately filed for bankruptcy on December 19, 1997. Nearly 500 unsecured creditors were affected by the bankruptcy, including many independent labels and numerous bands. Companies affected included Epitaph (which was owed $511,000, making it the company's largest single unsecured creditor), Windsong, Caroline, Overground Trading, Om, Victory, Shock and Mushroom. Even Goodis and Hill were still owed over half a million dollars on their 1995 sale of the company. In total, the company had $3.77 million in unpaid debts by the time of its bankruptcy.

The beach at the bay lies in front of a valley in which the Nant Tresilian flows and empties in the sea. It lies along a stretch of coast and cliff path under protection by the Glamorgan Heritage Coast, characterised by limestone cliffs with many caves and several bays/valleys. There is a distinctive white house, Tresilian House, located at Tresilian Bay at the end of the valley in front of the pebble beach and a pill box on the cliff nearby. The cove of Col Huw is located nearby. History Tresilian Bay takes its name from Prince Silian who is reputed to have kept court there in the 3rd and 4th centuries. The bay once had an inn which was frequented by smugglers and pirates. The cliffs in the area are said to contain many secret passages and tunnels which they used. Legend has it that in the mid 15th century, a Breton pirate called Peter was drowned in a cave to the west of the bay by Sir Henry Stradling (1423‚Äì1476), seeking revenge after Peter had previously kidnapped him. On winter nights under a full moon his cries can reputedly be heard in the wind. However, George Yates' map of 1799 does not show a building here, but it appears in records from soon afterwards. A lease was granted in 1800 by the owner of the St Donats estate and after functioning for a period as a hotel it became a private residence, most tenants being gentry and farmers. At one time, Tresilian House was lived in by Owen Crawshay, son of Tudor Crawshay, Deputy Lieutenant of Glamorgan and vicar‚Äôs warden of St. Illtud‚Äôs Church, who lived at nearby Dimlands. In 1862, Dr. John Whitlock Nicholl Carne, owner of the St Donats estate, closed the drive to the public. There is also a cave nearby which has an arched roof known as the \\"bow of destiny\\" which is visited by couples who throw pebbles; however many attempts it takes to strike the rock is taken as the number of years they should wait to marry.

However, in 1893, the mine collapsed and flooded, killing 27 miners. The mine closed, and Mansfield was leveled by a forest fire. In 1896, the mine was reopened, and was kept in operation until 1913. Also in 1913, the Iron County Road Commission began the development of a trunk line route through Crystal Falls and into Mansfield. They planned further development of the route to the east, but this required that the bridge over the Michigammes River be replaced. In 1914, it was decided to replace the bridge. The Michigan State Highway Department designed a new bridge, and the contract to build it was awarded to McGrath and Sons of Green Bay, Wisconsin, for $9,769.06. The bride was completed in 1915. The trunk line through Mansfield was later incorporated into M-69, but by 1936 the highway was rerouted and the section of road containing this bridge was reverted to a county road. In 2007, the bridge was replaced with a replica. Description The Mansfield Road‚ÄìMichigamme River Bridge was long and wide, with a main span of and a roadway width of .

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. History The village of Iron River was platted in 1881 along the Iron River. The river itself flowed through the center of town, and was an impediment to travel between the two sides of town. The first bridge spanning the river here was built in the 19th century; however, the boom in Iron River's population in the early 20th century, in addition to the designation of a state trunk line through Iron River, put a strain on the original structure. In the mid-1910s, the village requested the Michigan State Highway Department design a replacement. The department designed this structure, designating it Trunk Line Bridge No. 191, and awarded a contract for its construction to the Hoose and Person Construction Company. Hoose and Person completed the bridge in 1917 at a cost of $20,343.16, of which the village of Iron River paid approximately two-thirds. In the 1920s, the trunk line through Iron River was incorporated into US 2. In 1998, US-2 was relocated, and the section where this bridge stands left to carry local traffic. Description The Iron River bridge is a filled spandrel arch bridge long and wide, with a roadway width of . It has a tapered ring arch, corbeled slightly from the spandrel. Concrete guardrails with incised panels are on each side. The bridge is in essentially unaltered condition.

The estate was built in 1902 for the family of Charles Harrington, who oversaw the Minneapolis office for the Van Dusen-Harrington Company, which specialized in grain processing and distribution. The Harrington Mansion and Events Center was purchased by Saint Mary's University of Minnesota in 2011, as the newest addition to Saint Mary's Minneapolis campus. The estate was previously owned by the Zuhrah Shrine, which bought the property from the Harrington family in 1929. The Harrington Mansion and Events Center, with a historic mansion, carriage house, modern events center, and 124 parking spaces, encompasses 1.66 acres in South Minneapolis. The historic mansion and carriage house cover 30,000 square feet, and the events center, built in 1990, contains 54,000 square feet.  History of the Harrington mansion  = Architecture = Designated historic by the Minneapolis Heritage Preservation Commission in 1988, the Italian Renaissance-style mansion was constructed by the Pike and Cook construction firm under the architectural direction of Frederick Kees and Serenus Colburn. Kees and Colburn also designed the Minneapolis Grain Exchange Building and the Loring Theater (formerly the Music Box Theater). During the construction, owner Charles Harrington hired prominent interior designer John Scott Bradstreet as well as artisans from Norway and Sweden to perfect the home's ornamental d√©cor. According to the Minneapolis Heritage Preservation Commission, the original Italian mosaic on the main entrance floor, ornate brass fittings, painted murals on the ceilings and walls, light fixtures, and the staircase woodcarvings that were done on a hand-peddled wood lathe can still be seen inside the mansion today. While occupied by the Harrington family, the mansion contained a library, drawing room, dining room, den, kitchen, and servants‚Äô hall; the family's bedrooms were located on the second floor. Each room on the second floor was once connected with the one adjoining it, so an entire circuit of the house could be made without entering the hallway. A ballroom and auditorium filled the third floor, while billiard and card rooms were housed in the basement. A June 1904 Western Architect article described the architectural elegance of the estate in great detail. = The Harrington family = Charles Harrington was born in New York in 1855 and moved to Rochester, Minnesota, in 1871 to work for the railroad industry. Shortly after, Harrington switched to the grain business and later partnered with George Van Dusen in 1889 to establish the Van Dusen-Harrington Company, a grain processing and distribution firm. As president of the company's Minneapolis office, Charles Harrington decided to build a house on Park Avenue, which was home to many of Minneapolis's wealthiest residents during the early 1900s. According to the 1910 federal census, Charles; his wife Grace (Ross) Harrington; their daughter Laura; Mrs. Harrington's sister, Isabel Ross; and three servants lived in the residence. In 1905 Laura Harrington married Walter Hudson, president of JB Hudson Jewelers, and their wedding reception was held in the mansion's ballroom. The couple lived with Mr. and Mrs. Harrington until 1917, when they bought a nearby property at 2400 Pillsbury Avenue. A Minneapolis business leader, Charles Harrington helped organize the Minneapolis Chamber of Commerce and served as the organization's president from 1890‚Äì1900. Charles served as president of the Van Dusen- Harrington Company until he died in 1928. The mansion was vacant until the Zuhrah Shrine acquired it in 1929 for its Zuhrah Temple. = The Zuhrah Shrine = The Zuhrah Shrine purchased the Harrington mansion in 1929 for $25,000. The organization used the mansion for Zuhrah events, meetings, and office space for 80 years. Under its ownership, the Zuhrah Shrine added a modern events center to the historic property. While the events center has been rebuilt twice, with the most recent construction taking place in 1990, the historic mansion remains largely intact. The Zuhrah Shrine sold the estate to Saint Mary's University of Minnesota in 2011.  Present uses  = Saint Mary‚Äôs University of Minnesota = Based in Winona, Minnesota, Saint Mary's University of Minnesota expanded its educational programs to serve the Twin Cities community by establishing a Minneapolis campus in 1983, located at 2500 Park Avenue South, less than one block from the Harrington estate. Saint Mary's University plans to use the Harrington property for its graduate programs, community outreach, and alumni events. The 54,000-square-foot events center is available for private conferences, banquets, and other events. The property also includes 124 parking spaces. Approximately 4,300 students are currently enrolled in the Schools of Graduate and Professional Programs, which is based at Saint Mary's Minneapolis campus.

Origins Until the middle of the nineteenth century the British Merchant Navy had no recognized training schools for boys entering the service. Education consisted of boys about 15 years old going to sea \\"to be led, guided, bullied and socialized into the culture of the sea\\". There was no distinction between training for AB, and the training of future masters. Through experience it was possible to rise to the position of Master without any formal training. Beginning in the mid- nineteenth century various forms of navigational and seamanship schools were created to remedy the problem Liverpool Swimming bath on the training ship \\"Indefatigable\\" at Liverpool. Wood engraving. Two schools were established in Liverpool, HMS Conway, to prepare boys to go to sea as apprentice officers, and the TS Indefatigable to prepare boys for life at sea as a member of the deck crew. In 1863 captain John Clint, a Liverpool shipowner, proposed the idea that a sea training school should be established for the orphans and sons of Liverpool seamen. Clint had helped found the Liverpool Shipowners' Association in 1839, the Pilots' Commission, the Dock and Harbour Company, the Liverpool Sailors' Home, the Northern Hospital, but most importantly Clint had been the prime mover in establishing HMS Conway and the Akbar, a reformatory school for boys. In 1864 the Admiralty agreed to loan HMS Indefatigable, a fifty‚Äìgun sailing ship frigate, launched in 1848, and retired from active service in 1857 to the Indefatigable committee. Mr. James Bibby contributed ¬£5,000 to convert HMS Indefatigable into a training ship, and this became the beginning of a long relationship between the Bibby family and TS Indefatigable, which continues today with Sir Michael Bibby as President of the Indefatigable Old Boys Association. The Indefatigable was moored at the Sloyne, off Rock Ferry on the River Mersey, alongside HMS Conway, Akbar and Clarence, both reformatory ships.\\"The Indefatigable National Sea Training School for Boys\\", http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/a2a/records.aspx?cat=138-387i The first boys to join the Indefatigable did so on 28 August 1865. The original Indefatigable remained off Rock Ferry until 1912 when it was deemed unfit for use. In 1913, the Admiralty agreed to sell HMS Phaeton to the Indefatigable committee for ¬£15,000. Mr. Frank Bibby gave the Indefatigable committee the money to buy the Phaeton and re-fit her as a training ship. The Phaeton was renamed the Indefatigable and moored off Rock Ferry on 15 January 1914, at which time the figurehead of William IV was transferred from the old Indefatigable to the new Indefatigable. 35 boys were admitted in the first year(1865). By 1868 148 boys were on board. World War II The Indefatigable remained on the Mersey until 1941, when it was decided that the intense German bombing of Liverpool during World War II made it too dangerous to remain anchored on the river Mersey. HMS Conway was towed to Anglesey. However, the decision was made to make the TS Indefatigable a land-based school in the future and the old TS Indefatigable was sold for scrap. Later in 1941 the admiralty re-purchased Indefatigable/ex Phaeton, renamed it Carrick II, and used it as a store ship on the River Clyde throughout the rest of World War II. In 1947, after the war, the Indefatigable was finally broken up after 64 years of service. Anglesey Temporary accommodation was initially found at a disused holiday camp at Clwydd Newydd, Ruthin, North Wales, before moving to Plas Llanfair in Llanfairpwllgwyngyll on the Menai Strait between Gwynedd and Anglesey in 1944. Plas Llanfair was once home to Admiral Lord Clarence Paget (1811‚Äì1895), commander-in-chief of the Mediterranean fleet from 1866 to 1869. Paget was the fourth son of the 1st Marquess of Anglesey (1758‚Äì1854), whose column towers above the school. Admiral Paget also had the statue of Lord Nelson erected on the banks of the Menai Strait in 1877 as an aid to navigation. In 1945 the TS Indefatigable merged with the Lancashire National Sea Training Home for boys and renamed The Indefatigable and National Sea Training School for boys. Although this was the official name the school was always known as the Indefatigable. Boys entered at aged fourteen, graduating at age sixteen to either the Merchant or Royal Navy. The Indefatigable was divided into four divisions; Drake, Raleigh, Rodney and Hood, with approximately thirty boys to each division. The school had three types of students, fee paying, orphans, and council subsidized boys. Up until the mid-1960s, positions were readily available in the British Merchant fleet and Royal Navy for graduating students. However, as the British Merchant Navy declined from a high of 3,112 British registered ships in 1957, to a low of 368 registered ships in 2001, positions at sea for the boys became difficult to find, and the school had to change from a sea-training school to a regular academic public school in an effort to attract more students. The End In 1989 new classrooms and sports facilities were built and the age of entry was lowered to the age of 11. However, the numbers continued to fall to around 120 in 1994/5 with an estimated 100 for 1996. The school could not carry on with these numbers, and at the end of term in 1995 the school was closed. The school was purchased by the Ministry of Defence in 1996 and renamed The Joint Service Mountain Training Centre Indefatigable. A ¬£4 million refurbishment began in July 1998 and the first students arrived in April 1999. The Nuffield Trust partly funded the cost of the refurbishment. In 1983, the Indefatigable Old Boys Association was created and an annual reunion is held at the school each year where the Ministry of Defence gives ex-students access to the old school.5\\\\.

Early life Born Asaba Waka in Kurihama Village, Miura County (present day Yokosuka), in Kanagawa Prefecture to a poor peasant family, at age 18, in 1897, she went to nearby Yokohama to look for a job. However, she was kidnapped and ended up being trafficked to Seattle to be a prostitute, becoming known there as \\"Arabian Oyae\\". She was held as a sex slave there until 1900, when she met a Japanese journalist, Tachii Nobusaburo or Shinzaburo Ritsui (Á´ã‰∫ï‰ø°‰∏âÈÉé), who became interested in her plight and helped her to escape to San Francisco. Her erstwhile savior then pimped her out himself, until she fled from him and found Cameron House, a Presbyterian mission set up to help prostitutes escape their plight. She converted to Christianity and worked there while taking English lessons. In 1903, she met Kakichi Yamada (Â±±Áî∞ÂòâÂêâ), a sociologist who ran an English school. They fell in love and married the following year, and in 1906 moved back to Japan. Activism They moved to Tokyo‚Äôs Yotsuya Ward, where she encountered the writings of pioneering Swedish women's rights advocate Ellen Key, who wrote a great deal on motherhood, pregnancy, childbirth, childcare, and the state protecting those roles. In addition, her husband began teaching foreign languages in his school to Osugi Sakae, who then introduced Waka to Hiratsuka Raicho‚Äôs magazine, Bluestocking. Yamada then embarked upon a career of fighting for women‚Äôs rights. She became one of the most prominent members of the Japanese women‚Äôs movement, including being a frequent contributor to Bluestocking (‚Äò‚ÄôSeito‚Äô‚Äô). She made known her own victimization as a prostitute, despite the social stigma associated with such an admission. She had a regular ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs‚Äù column in the newspaper ‚Äò‚ÄôAsahi Shimbun‚Äô‚Äô. She became the Japanese translator for Olive Schreiner. She differed from many other Japanese feminists of the era in that her central interest was in protecting and elevating women's roles as wife and mother. This goal was similar to that of her ideological inspiration, Ellen Key, and it also put her goals in line with the goals of imperial Japan, which advocated the importance of good wives and wise mothers, and had a very pro- natalist ideology in order to encourage children to support the war. This attitude put her at odds with most of the other feminists of the day, many of whom were not supporters of the Japanese imperial goals, and who emphasized more equality with men without being as concerned about the roles of wife and mother. Yamada advocated for a ‚ÄúMaternal and Child Protection Act‚Äù, which culminated in the founding of the New Women's Association (Shin Fujin Kyokai). In 1934, she founded the Women's League (soon renamed the Maternity Protection League (Bosei Hogo Renmei)) and became its chair. Her prominence was such that when she visited the United States for a lecture tour, she was invited to visit Eleanor Roosevelt at the White House, which she did on December 7, 1937. In 1938, she opened the first shelter for women and children fleeing abusive homes in Japan. Following the end of World War II, she was upset to see state- supported prostitution created for American servicemen then occupying Japan. While the state-supported brothels were soon closed, there remained many prostitutes on the streets in the chaotic times after the war, many having lost their homes and families in the war. In response to this, Yamada opened a school in Tokyo much like Cameron House, in 1947, designed to help Japanese prostitutes escape their situation by learning valuable skills. In fiction In the graphic novel Sous le soleil de minuit, published in 2015 by writer Juan D√≠az Canales and artist Rub√©n Pellejero, Waka Yamada is rescued by Corto Maltese in 1915 in Dawson, Alaska where she was retained by a madam on behalf of a Japanese syndicate.Bajo el sol de medianoche, Juan D√≠az Canales and Rub√©n Pellejero, Norma Editorial, Barcelona, 2015.

He was also notable as being Brazil's second openly gay member of parliament and the first congressman who was a gay-rights activist.Jean Wyllys, Brazil's first openly gay MP, takes fight to the religious right, Guardian, retrieved 27 January 2012 He has been compared to Harvey Milk for his work. In 2019, citing death threats, he gave up on his Congress seat.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-24/gay-brazilian- congressman-resigns-his-seat-citing-death-threats Life Wyllys was born in Alagoinhas, in the north-eastern state of Bahia, one of seven children. His mother was a washerwoman and his father a car painter who suffered from alcoholism. Wyllys attended a boarding school which gave him the opportunity to get a better education than the average child in his village. Wyllys later moved to Salvador and completed his degree in journalism at the Federal University of Bahia. He first rose to fame after becoming the finalist in the Brazilian reality television show, Big Brother Brasil in its fifth season in 2005. He was the first openly gay participant in the show, which caused a lot of controversy amongst fans and participants alike. Wyllys described his victory as being of \\"great political relevance [...] I said I was a homosexual and I still won the programme in a country that is homophobic.\\" =Political career= In 2010 Wyllys was elected a federal MP, representing the Socialism and Freedom party, with an average of 13,000 votes. His election was only possible, considering the number of votes he had in 2010 elections, through the so-called \\"voto de legenda\\" (party vote), a constitutional mechanism that allows candidates who don't have a large number of votes to be elected through votes of another highly voted candidate of the same party. In Wyllys's case, the votes of another congressman of Socialism and Liberty Party, Chico Alencar, who was one of the most voted in Rio de Janeiro, helped in his election. Upon occupying a seat in the Brazilian Congress, Wyllys brought his LGBT movement activism to the scene. He started working on his political platform, which was primarily focused on the fight for LGBT rights. In so doing, he ended up confronting prominent Brazilian right-wing figures, such as pastor Silas Malafaia, a famous televangelist and national president of the Assembly of God Churches, and Jair Bolsonaro, a congressman (later elected president) who became Wyllys's nemesis in the Brazilian Congress. Wyllys came to the point of spiting on congressman Bolsonaro during the voting of President Dilma Roussef's impeachment. In Congress, Wyllys proposed three controversial pieces of legislation, including the regulation of prostitution, the legalization and government regulation of marijuana production, and the government financing of sex reassignment surgeries and hormonal treatment for transgender teenagers and adults. Wyllys' defense of minority rights and his very existence as an openly gay congress member and human rights activist have made him a public enemy of conservative political forces in Brazil. Living in a country with such a high rate of homophobic crimes as Brazil, Wyllys began to receive death threats. These became more recurrent after his political enemies began a slanderous campaign against him by posting and sharing in social media, including Facebook, images with quotes attributed to him, portraying him as being openly a paedophile. Among other false remarks attributed to him was one which stated that the Bible was \\"a joke\\" and that Christians and Bible followers were \\"clowns\\". This was widely circulated. Nevertheless, people in social networks still shared them, strengthening the ongoing hate campaign against Wyllys. To repair his image damaged by the orchestrated campaign, he created a section on his official webpage where he refutes all the quotes attributed to him. Although his political image in the public sphere had been tarnished by the slanderous campaign, Wyllys ran for congress once again in 2014 and kept his seat in parliament with more than 100,000 votes, being the seventh most voted-for representative from Rio de Janeiro. In 2015, it was announced that Brazilian independent filmmakers were planning to produce a documentary about Wyllys's political career and activism. The documentary was released in 2016 with the title \\"Entre os Homens de Bem\\" (Among Virtuous Men). The documentary focuses on the political arena in Brazil and addresses topics such as gay marriage and LGBT rights, and features Wyllys and his conservative opponents. In that same year, Wyllys was included in the \\"Top 50 global personalities with an outstanding commitment to diversity\\" list. = Resignation = Wyllys was re-elected to a third term as deputy in the 2018 election. However, the campaign took a toll on him. His close friend, Rio de Janeiro city councillor Marielle Franco, was fatally shot in March 2018. In January 2019, just days before the February 1 swearing-in of the 56th Congress, Wyllys released a note from overseas stating that he would not return to Brazil due to alleged death threats and that he would not assume his position as congressman. He told the Folha de S√£o Paulo newspaper that he did not want to live four years under close security watch. His replacement in the Chamber of Deputies will be David Miranda. Soon after news of Wyllys' resignation broke, President Bolsonaro reacted on Twitter, by posting the phrasis \\"Great day\\" followed by a \\"thumbs-up\\" emoji. His son, Carlos Bolsonaro, also tweeted: \\"Go with God and be happy\\".

Her primary role is transporting components for the ULA Atlas V, Delta IV and Vulcan rockets from the manufacturer, located in Decatur, Alabama, to launch facilities at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida and Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The ship is designed for shallow inland waterways as well as the open ocean and is capable of carrying up to three Delta IV Common Booster Cores. Some cargos carried by RocketShip were formerly transported by an Antonov An-124 Ruslan from the manufacturer to the launch site.  History  Delta Mariner docked at Port Canaveral, Florida, 2008 The ship initially entered service as a maritime rocket carrier for the Boeing Corporation as the Delta Mariner. Use of Delta Mariner was transferred to ULA after the company was created in 2006 to handle all United States military launch services. ULA is a 50/50 joint venture created out of the rocket manufacturing and launch service businesses of Boeing and Lockheed Martin for their Delta and Atlas V launch vehicles, respectively. For ULA, the ship has transported the Atlas V, Delta IV and Delta II rockets under the Delta Mariner livery. On September 27, 2019, United Launch Alliance re-christened the vessel RocketShip in a ceremony at its factory in Decatur. = Shipping routes = Completed rocket stages and other components are transported by truck approximately from the Decatur manufacturing facility to the dock on the Tennessee River and driven directly onto the ship. From Decatur, RocketShip uses two routes to the Gulf of Mexico. The first route takes the vessel downstream on the Tennessee River to the Tennessee‚ÄìTombigbee Waterway, south to the Tombigbee River, and into Mobile Bay and the Gulf of Mexico, a distance of about . The second route takes the Tennessee and Ohio Rivers downstream, south on the Mississippi River, and into the Gulf, more than . From the ULA plant, RocketShip may travel around the Florida peninsula to Cape Canaveral, a trip; or through the Panama Canal to Vandenberg, a three-week journey which covers around . = Incidents =  Grounding  On August 7, 2001, Delta Mariner ran aground on a sandbar in the Tennessee River during its initial docking attempt at Decatur. This was Delta Mariners first arrival at the dock since its launch. The vessel was freed by a tugboat about an hour after the incident.  Bridge collision  Delta Mariner after its collision with Eggner's Ferry Bridge On January 26, 2012, around 20:10 CST, Delta Mariner struck the Eggner's Ferry Bridge, which crosses Kentucky Lake near Murray and Cadiz, Kentucky. There were no injuries on the ship or bridge, and, while Delta Mariner was \\"not severely damaged\\" and the cargo of Atlas and Centaur stages was undamaged, the collision destroyed a section of the bridge. According to Foss Maritime's spokesman, this was on the regular route taken by the vessel. U.S. Coast Guard officials state the vessel was operating in a recreational channel at the time of the collision, rather than the shipping channel which offers greater bridge clearance. Foss representatives stated that the bridge's channel navigation lights were not operational, though Kentucky Transportation Cabinet (KYTC) Secretary Mike Hancock stated this should not have been a significant factor in the incident and KYTC spokesman Keith Todd said he believes most of the lights were functioning at the time. The ship remained anchored at the bridge after the incident took place so that salvage plans could be developed and equipment moved into place. Salvage operations were led by T&T; Bisso of Houston, with assistance from local and regional companies. During February 4‚Äì5, salvage divers worked to remove debris which caught underwater on Delta Mariners hull. On February 6, the vessel was freed from the underwater debris and the Coast Guard approved its relocation to a safe harbor one mile downriver so that its bow could be cleared. By February 14, the bridge debris had been cleared and the vessel had relocated to the James Marine drydock in Paducah, Kentucky, to undergo repairs. Delta Mariner was cleared by the American Bureau of Shipping on February 17 to proceed on its journey, and it docked at Port Canaveral, Florida, on February 23. In their investigation, the National Transportation Safety Board concluded that \\"the bridge team's exclusive reliance on the contract pilot's incorrect navigational direction as the vessel approached the bridge and their failure to use all available navigation tools to verify the safety of the vessel's course\\" was the cause of the incident, noting that the bridge crew ignored two Coast Guard broadcasts and a radio call from the vessel Addi Bell regarding navigational lights being out at the bridge. The NTSB cited the KYTC's failure to maintain the bridge's navigational lighting as a contributing factor; white navigation lights had been out of service for over a year and additional navigation lights indicating the bridge's high point had shorted out in the days leading up to the incident. Repairs to the bridge, led by Hall Contracting, cost more than according to the KYTC, and costs associated with repairs to Delta Mariner and removal of debris from its hull were estimated at . The bridge reopened on May 25, 2012. In 2017, Foss Maritime agreed to pay to the KYTC as settlement in the incident.

Its reporters have been the subject of several high-profile criminal trials, and its editor Freedom Neruda was named a World Press Freedom Hero for his work with the paper. Beginning of Neruda's editorship After an unsuccessful attempt to start his own independent newspaper, La Chronique du Soir, Neruda agreed to take over La Voie in 1991. With Neruda as its editor- in-chief, La Voie quickly went on to become the best-selling independent newspaper in C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire. The paper regularly ran critical coverage of the government of Ivorian President Henri Konan B√©di√©, resulting in several court appearances on defamation charges and prison sentences for at least six members of the editorial staff. In 1995, the paper's offices were firebombed, but no one was hurt. \\"Il maudit l'ASEC\\" trial On 18 December 1995, La Voie ran an article on the Ivorian ASEC Mimosas's loss to the South African Orlando Pirates in the finals of football's CAF Champions League. A sidebar by reporter Emmanuel Kor√©, headlined \\"Il maudit l‚ÄôASEC\\" (\\"He cursed/jinxed ASEC\\"), jokingly suggested that the bad luck of President B√©di√©'s presence had caused the team's defeat; the article also played on the slogans from B√©di√©'s re-election literature of the previous year, in which he promised to bring \\"good luck\\" to the nation. Although the sidebar was one of the less serious criticisms of the B√©di√© government that had appeared in La Voie, by naming the president explicitly, it posed a direct challenge to a 1991 statute allowing the state to prosecute \\"people who insult government officials or offices\\" for criminal libel. Kor√© and La Voie's publication director Abou Drahamane Sangar were arrested shortly after the article's appearance. A warrant was also issued for Neruda, who evaded arrest for several days to arrange care for his ten-year-old son. On 2 January 1996, Neruda turned himself in at a police station and was also arrested. On 11 January, Neruda, Kor√© and Sangar were convicted of \\"offenses against the head of state\\" and sentenced to two years' imprisonment apiece. Additionally, La Voie was fined three million West African CFA francs (about $6000 USD) and banned from publishing for three months; the paper avoided the ban by publishing under the name L'alternative for the duration of the sentence, returning to its original name when the ban was complete. During his imprisonment, Neruda continued to write news stories from jail, smuggling them out and publishing them in L'alternative under the apparently female pen name \\"Bintou Diawara\\". His topics included a financial scandal and the more lenient sentences given to wealthy Lebanese prisoners. When the three journalists appealed their sentences to the Supreme Court in August, President B√©di√© appeared on television offering them a pardon if they would withdraw the appeal. Feeling that this would be a tacit admission of guilt, the journalists refused the offer. The Supreme Court rejected their appeal in November, but the three were nonetheless released on 1 January 1997, having served only half of their sentences. Neruda was later awarded the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee to Protect Journalists, and in 2000, he was named one of the International Press Institute's 50 World Press Freedom Heroes of the past 50 years. 2010‚Äì2011 Ivorian crisis Following the 2010 presidential election, both the incumbent Laurent Gbagbo and opposition candidate Alassane Ouattara declared victory. Gbago refused to step down despite the United Nations proclaiming Ouattara the winner. Fighting soon broke out between Gbagbo's Ivorian Popular Front (FPI) and Ouattara's Rally of the Republicans (RDR), causing some commentators to refer to the crisis as the Second Ivorian Civil War. Notre Voie, which BBC News has described as \\"openly very sympathetic to the FPI\\", supported Gbagbo. After his 11 April 2011 arrest by pro-Ouattara forces, the paper's offices were ransacked by protesters. The paper relocated to the suburbs of Abidjan, and Republican Forces of C√¥te d'Ivoire soldiers were stationed at the paper's headquarters until August; according to Reporters Without Borders, the soldiers also barred staff from the premises, preventing them from using equipment and the paper's archives. On November 2011, the Ivorian government charged Notre Voie reporters C√©sar Etou and Boga Sivori and administrator Didier D√©pry with \\"incitement to theft, looting and destruction of the property of others through the press\\". The three began a hunger strike after their arrest. Several African media watchdog groups protested, including the Media Foundation for West Africa, which described the charges as \\"bogus\\". The journalists were released after thirteen days in custody when a judge dismissed the case.

After telling Greene that he still thinks he is the best, the boy offers him his bottle of Coke; Greene sheepishly accepts it with thanks and drinks the entire bottle as the boy quietly says \\"See ya 'round\\" and slowly walks away. When Greene finishes the Coke he turns back to the boy and says \\"Hey, kid... catch,\\" tossing his jersey (slung over his shoulder) to the surprised boy who happily says \\"Wow! Thanks, Mean Joe!\\" Greene casts a smile toward the boy before continuing his trek to the locker room. =Production Notes and Accolades= The campaign's art director was Roger Mosconi, the writer was Penny Hawkey, and the singers of the \\"Coke and a Smile\\" jingle were Jim Campbell, Don Thomas, Liz Corrigan, Shellie Littman, Arlene Martell, and Linda November. The footage was shot in May 1979 at a small stadium in Mount Vernon, New York, and the commercial first aired on October 1, 1979 on ABC's Monday Night Football, though its airing during Super Bowl XIV in 1980 brought it the most attention due to the program's enormous audience. The commercial has been listed as one of the top ads of all time by multiple sources, including TV Guide. The ad later received worldwide acclaim when it was re- filmed in various countries using indigenous sports figures in each version. Greene later recalled that in filming the commercial, it took several takes to get his final line in the commercial in without burping. \\"Between me belching and going to the men's room, it took three days to film it,\\" Greene recalled. The end of the commercial was also shown during the 2004 film Miracle when the USA vs. USSR hockey game was on a commercial break. In 2016 Joe reunited with Tommy Okon during a two-hour CBS special filmed at Apogee Stadium in Denton, Texas honoring Super Bowl‚Äôs Greatest Commercials.https://www.lohud.com/story/news/local/westchester/2016/02/02/mean- joe-greene/79691678/ Greene speaking with Okon almost 40 years since the original filming said to Okon ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs great to see you.

Continuing an ongoing theme in promotion for the beverage, the ad is interrupted by Coca-Cola \\"brand managers\\" who accuse Polamalu of \\"stealing\\" their commercial, prompting the safety to tackle one of them and give the child their shirt. * In January 2011, an episode of SportsNation on ESPN2 briefly parodied this commercial which featured sportscaster Michelle Beadle in Greene's role. In the commercial, after finishing the soda, instead of the jersey, she \\"accidentally\\" throws the empty soda bottle back to the child as it breaks on the wall at the end and then apologizes after that \\"mishap\\". In addition, the commercial tried to look like the late 1970s/early 1980s font titles with the words \\"Facebook.com/SportsNation\\" and \\"Have Some \\"SportsNation\\" and a smile\\" and \\"Sports is Life\\". * In February 2011, an advertisement for the Fox television drama series House, first aired during Super Bowl XLV, parodies the original commercial with a similar scene in which Dr. Gregory House, played by Hugh Laurie, throws his cane to a young fan played by Preston Bailey. * In 2012, Greene reprised his role in a Downy Unstopables ad for Super Bowl XLVI entitled \\"Stinky\\", where Amy Sedaris rejects Greene's jersey because it smelled. * In 2016, forward-center for the Sacramento Kings DeMarcus Cousins did a recreation of the classic commercial in order to promote the 2016 All-Star Voting process.

Her godmother was Queen Elizabeth I of England, who was represented on this occasion by the Earl of Lincoln. The christening of the Princess was one of the most elaborate ceremonies at the court in Kassel, including \\"four days of lavish games, tournaments, and fireworks\\". The last knight games in Europe were held on this occasion. The engraver and historian Wilhelm Dilich made a documentary about the event in 1598-1601. That volume is now in the City of Kassel Museum.

The AGG has a permanent collection of over 9000 works which is a focus of research, publishing, educational programs, and touring exhibitions. The AGG is a non-profit charitable organization with three sponsors: the University of Guelph, the City of Guelph, and the Upper Grand District School Board. As the principal public art gallery serving Guelph and the surrounding region, the Art Gallery of Guelph was founded as a new cultural institution to benefit the broad community. MSAC was established in 1978 through a provincial act as a non-profit charitable organization. When the gallery formally opened as a public art gallery on November 7, 1980, the University of Guelph curator, Judith Nasby, was appointed director and curator of the MSAC. Architect Raymond Moriyama renovated the historic 1904 school building to create a public art gallery meeting international standards. In 1983, the Donald Forster Sculpture Park was established on the 2.5 acre site adjacent to the building. It is the largest outdoor collection at an institution in Canada and has since grown to include 39 works, with an overall objective of 50, representing artists from across Canada.Bendo,Flora.

In 2016, the Art Gallery of Guelph appointed new leadership: Shauna McCabe became the gallery's Director on August 1, 2016. The AGG is housed in a 31,000 square foot building comprising seven gallery spaces on two floors. There are three open-concept galleries on the main floor, including a central clerestory gallery. The second floor boasts three uniquely configured gallery spaces, as well as a lecture room, large-scale art storage, and an art studio. The AGG undertakes contemporary exhibition programming featuring international and national artists as well as the curation of exhibitions highlighting the work of emerging to established regional artists. The Art Gallery of Guelph collection includes a large assortment of Canadian art, an expansive Inuit art collection and many other unique pieces. In 1926, the Ontario Agricultural College (affiliated with the University of Guelph since 1964) purchased a painting by Tom Thomson called The Drive (c. 1916), which marked the start of the collection and is now one of the gallery's most celebrated works. Today the permanent collection of over 9000 works features First Nations, Inuit, Canadian and international art. History Tom Thomson, The Drive, . This painting was purchased in 1926 by the Ontario Agricultural College with funds raised by students, faculty and staff. Today it is the art gallery's most famous piece. Macdonald Consolidated School was built in 1904; the school's vision was to amalgamate small rural schools into one larger school with qualified teachers, an initiative known as the \\"Macdonald Movement\\". Funding was provided by Sir William Macdonald however, during construction, the trustees made design changes without informing him and upon seeing the building on opening day, Macdonald was so enraged that he refused to leave his carriage, boarded a train instead and never returned to Guelph. The school closed in 1972 and reopened as The Macdonald Stewart Art Centre. Incorporation On November 30, 1978 the Macdonald Stewart Art Centre was incorporated as a Non-Profit Organization and registered as a Charitable Organization. The creation of the Macdonald Stewart Art Centre took place when the centre was established through a private member's bill introduced to the provincial legislature. There were four sponsors of the centre: the Wellington County Board of Education, the City of Guelph, the County of Wellington and the University of Guelph. In 2012, the County exited the partnership and subsequently the Art Gallery of Guelph Act, through which the gallery's name change was achieved, received Royal Assent on December 11, 2014.

Prof. Zhong Lin Wang at Georgia Institute of Technology proposed the fundamental principle of this effect in 2010. Mechanism Energy band diagrams for a p-n junction (a) with the absence of piezo-charges, and (b, c) with the presence of positive and negative piezo-charges at the junction, respectively. The red solid lines are the band diagrams with considering the piezopotential. Holes are trapped at the interface due to the piezopotential modified energy band, which will enhance the electron-hole recombination efficiency. Schematic diagram showing the three-way coupling among piezoelectricity, photoexcitation and semiconductor properties. When a p-type semiconductor and a n-type semiconductor form a junction, the holes in the p-type side and the electrons in the n-type side tend to redistribute around the interface area to balance the local electric field, which results in a charge depletion layer. The diffusion and recombination of the electrons and holes in the junction region is closely related to the optoelectronic properties of the device, which is greatly affected by the local electric field distribution. The existence of the piezo-charges at the interface introduces three effects: a shift in local electronic band structure due to the introduced local potential, a tilt of the electronic band structure over the junction region for the polarization existing in the piezoelectric semiconductor, and a change in the charge depletion layer due to the redistribution of the local charge carriers to balance the local piezo- charges. The positive piezoelectric charges at the junction lower the energy band and the negative piezoelectric charges raise the energy band in n-type semiconductor region near the junction region. A modification in the local band by piezopotential may be effective for trapping charges so that the electron-hole recombination rate can be largely enhanced, which is very beneficial for improving the efficiency of a light-emitting diode. Furthermore, the inclined band tends to change the mobility of the carriers moving toward the junction. The materials for piezo-phototronics should have three basic properties: piezoelectricity, semiconductor property, and photon excitation property [5]. Typical materials are the wurtzite structures, such as ZnO, GaN and InN. the three-way coupling among piezoelectricity, photoexcitation and semiconductor properties, which is the basis of piezotronics (piezoelectricity-semiconductor coupling), piezophotonics (piezoelectric-photon excitation coupling), optoelectronics, and piezo- phototronics piezoelectricity-semiconductor-photoexcitation). The core of these coupling relies on the piezopotential created by the piezoelectric materials.

Her papers have been collected by New York University's Fales Library Downtown Collection. Terence Sellers was born in 1952 to Robert and Gloria Sellers in Washington, D.C.. From 1970-1973 she attended St. John's College in Santa Fe, New Mexico in the Classical Studies department but did not complete her degree. She earned a BA in forensic psychology at John Jay College in New York City in 1986. In 1973 Sellers moved to New York City intending to pursue a career in writing and dance. Shortly after moving to New York she formed friendships with artists and writers including Anya Phillips, Kathy Acker, Duncan Smith, Victor Bockris, Carl Apfelschnitt, Jimmy De Sana and Duncan Hannah, many of which resulted in collaborations. For example, Sellers and Hannah worked on several projects together, including Amos Poe's 1978 film The Foreigner. Around the same time Sellers worked with photographer Jimmy De Sana on a series of 32 photographs entitled \\"The Dungeon Series\\". The original intent of the project was to use the photographs in Sellers' then unpublished work The Correct Sadist. However, after the work was complete De Sana and William S. Burroughs used the photographs to illustrate their own book project, Submission. As a prolific writer, Sellers kept daily journals, maintained close correspondence with friends, family and colleagues, wrote a large volume of short stories and worked on several manuscripts. She was an early contributor to BOMB Magazine, X Magazine, Vacation and other publications devoted to New York's Downtown art, music, film and literary scene. Most of Sellers' writing is on the subject of sadomasochism. While her work as a professional dominatrix and her fascination with violence, self- punishment, the occult, and psychoanalysis has given shape to much of her writing, her literary influences include Baudelaire, Dostoevsky, and the French surrealists. Sellers' most famous work is a novel called The Correct Sadist: The Memoirs of Angel Stern. It is written as a collection of short \\"case studies\\" relating to themes of sexual dominance and submission, bondage and discipline, and fetishism. Originally published by iKoo-Buchverlg in Berlin in 1981 as Der korrekte Sadismus, Sellers self-published the work in English under Vitriol Publications in 1983. In 1985, Grove Press contracted the novel and Barney Rosset handled its publication. It is also published in France, Italy, and the United Kingdom. Sellers' other published novels include The Obsession, and Dungeon Evidence: The Correct Sadist II. Excerpts from other manuscripts such as The Degenerate, Most Ill of All and One Decadent Life have appeared in a wide range of publications in several languages. Sellers participated in events such as The Times Square Show (1980) and has read her work throughout the US, Europe and Canada. Although Sellers did not achieve the name recognition and literary success of some of her contemporaries, she was an important and influential member of the Downtown scene.Guide to the Terence Sellers papersLatzky, Eric, Ira Silverberg and Amy Scholder, \\"High Risk: An Anthology of Forbidden Writings\\" in Bomb Magazine No 35. spring 1991. 32-34.\\"How to Shoot a Crime: a film a crime a city.\\" LA, CA [Los Angeles, Calif.] : Chris Kraus/Lonely Girl Films, [¬©2000?] References  External links  * * Jimmy De Sana Papers at New York University * Sylvere Lotringer and Semiotext(e) Papers at New York University Category:Writers from Washington, D.C.

The Carpathian Flysch Belt is an arcuate tectonic zone included in the megastructural elevation of the Carpathians on the external periphery of the mountain chain. Geomorphologically it is a portion of Outer Carpathians. Geologically it is a thin-skinned thrust belt or accretionary wedge, formed by rootles nappes consisting of so-called flysch - alternating marine deposits of claystones, shales and sandstones which were detached from their substratum and moved tens of kilometers to the north (generally). The Flysch Belt is together with Neogene volcanic complexes only tectonic zone occurring along the whole Carpathian arc.  Areal extent  The Carpathian Flysch Belt is connected to the flysch belt of the Alps (Rhenodanubian Flysch) and continues through the territory of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Ukraine and Romania. The belt is about 1,300 km long and 60 ‚Äì 75 km wide.Veƒæk√Ω, J. (Ed.), 1978, Encyclopaedia of Slovakia vol. II. E - J. Veda, Bratislava, pp. 103 (In Slovak) Sequences of the Flysch belt are thrusted over the margin of Carpathian foredeep in the north. The foreland of the Flysch belt is built by Bohemian Massif in the west, East-European Platform in the north and Moesian Platform in the east. In the south it is bounded by the Pieniny Klippen Belt in its western segment. The southern boundary of the Flysch Belt in the area of the Romanian Carpathians is covered by nappes of the crystalline-Mesozoic zone.Dumitrescu, I., Sandulescu, M., 1974, Flysch Zone. in Maheƒæ, M.

Geological Institute of Dion√Ωz ≈†t√∫r, Bratislava, pp. 253-264  Geological structure  The Zone is composed basically of sedimentary rocks which were deposited since the Upper Jurassic up to Cretaceous-Paleogene time. The Flysch Belt is structural remnant of several basins, developed in front of the advancing ancestral Carpathians and later incorporated in the Tertiary Carpathian fold and thrust belt.Te≈•√°k, F., Pivko, D. & Kov√°ƒçik, M., 2019: Depositional systems and paleogeography of Upper Cretaceous-Paleogene deep-sea flysch deposits of the Magura Basin (Western Carpathians). Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, 533. Former sedimentary basin of the Carpathian Flysch belt were portion of the Alpine Tethys Ocean. Present rocks are not in their former position because they were detached from their basement during closure and subduction of basins and pushed as nappe pile, forming Carpathian accretionary wedge. Fold axial planes have generally north vergence, North-western in the western sector, northern in the central sector and north-eastern to eastern in the eastern sector. Only nappes of South Carpathians have eastern to south-eastern vergence. Approximately at the line of Hodon√≠n - N√°mestovo - Nowy Sacz - Neresnica distinct zone of negative gravimetric anomaly that follows the southern edge of the Bohemian Massif and East-European Platform which are underthrusted below the Carpathians. Anomalous crustal thickening, significant especially in southeastern Poland and western Ukraine, is probably caused by slab break off. The Earth's crust in this area reaches up to 65 km depth. From the neotectonic point of view whole area of flysch belt is affected by extension, locally up to 12 mm per year. = Regional division = Outer Carpathian tectonic units included in the Flysch Belt are divided according to their structural position in the frame of mountain range. Tectonic units vary not only in their structural position but also in differences in sedimentary sequences and other anomalies. Various tectonic divisions of the Flysch Belt were introduced. Generally these principal zones can be recognized:Pla≈°ienka, D., Grecula, P., Puti≈°, M., Kov√°ƒç, M., Hovorka, D., 1997, Evolution and structure of the Western Carpathians: an overview.

Sedimentation in the basins of the Flysch Belt is recorded since Upper Jurassic period up to Oligocene resp. beginning of Miocene. Basins of the Flysch zone were formed in Middle Jurassic ‚Äî Lower Cretaceous period of post-rift subsidence. During Upper Cretaceous‚ÄîPalaeocene time inversion locally occurred. In the most areas subsidence continued through Palaeocene to Middle Eocene. Synorogenic closing of the basins followed in Upper Eocene‚ÄìLower Miocene.Oszczypko, N., 2004, The structural position and tectonosedimentary evolution of the Polish Outer Carpathians. PrzeglƒÖd Geologiczny, vol. 52, no. 8/2, pp. 780-791 Nappes are mostly composed of turbidites - alternating sandstones and claystones. In the past it was believed that source area of the clastic sediments supplied to the basins was built by system of linear island elevations which were parallel to the axis of the mountain chain.Maheƒæ, M., 1986, Geological structure of Czechoslovak Carpathians. Paleoalpine units 1. Veda, Bratislava, 503 pp. (in Slovak with English summary) Although such conceptions still remains, recent interpretations assume that material was supplied by submarine canyons from the adjacent shelf areas (e.g. Nesvaƒçilka canyon). Nappes of the Flysch Belt were thrusted due to subduction of their basement and later formed and fold and thrust belt. Character of the lithosphere in former Flysch basins (oceanic, suboceanic or continental) is a matter of debate. Deformation of the belt was gradual. Area of the Magura Basin was deformed in the Upper Oligocene to Badenian (Middle Miocene).Voz√°r, J., Vojtko, R., Sliva, ƒΩ., (Editors) 2002, Guide to geological excursion.

Moldavide Flysch was deformed since Burdigalian, especially in Sarmatian and Badenian. Internal nappes show older Upper Cretaceous deformation. Subduction of the Flysch Belt basement was generally south verging, internal units were therefore thrust over the external ones from the south to north (in the Western sector) or West to East (in Eastern sector). The Tertiary shortening of Flysch Belt is approximately 130‚Äì135 km.Roure, F., Roca, E., Sassi, W, 1993, The Neogene evolution of the outer Carpathian flysch units (Poland, Ukraine and Romania): kinematics of a foreland/fold-and-thrust belt system.

Plot It now seems likely that not only was Colonel Porter killed recently, but that the 4th and 5th Mass met the same fate as the 7th Mass. Moreover, the aliens have started mysteriously pulling back all of their patrols to form a more secure defensive perimeter around Boston. While the 2nd Mass has scored some victories against the aliens, considering the losses the other militias seem to have taken, it is considered unlikely that the aliens are simply trying to preserve thinning resources. Rather, it is speculated that alien reinforcements must be coming to Earth soon, so their new plan is to just focus on defending their \\"beachheads\\" in the massive command towers they have deployed in major cities. When the reinforcements arrive, they will start a huge offensive against the human militias. Therefore, Weaver becomes determined that they must make an all-or-nothing assault on the command tower in Boston, while they still can. Tom discovers that Weaver surreptitiously obtained drugs - sedatives and stimulants - from Lourdes some time ago and has been taking them since. Tom confronts him about this and questions him his mental state, his ability to lead the fighters and help the civilians, and his orders to continue the attack in the face of heavy odds. but Weaver reacts by ordering Tom locked up. Tom manages to escape with Hal and Jimmy's help, confronts Weaver and convinces him to improve his original plan. Tom respects Captain Weaver for keeping all of the civilians alive and organizing the militias after the first chaotic weeks of the invasion, so he gives Weaver a chance to come clean to the 2nd Mass. When Weaver and Tom are walking to the assembly, it is revealed by Weaver that he stopped taking the drugs after the incident in Boston, where he discovered his daughter's glasses. Weaver admits to the assembled group that they have received no contact from the 4th and 5th Mass militias, making it look increasingly probable that Colonel Porter is dead. Without these reinforcements, the 2nd Mass will be heavily outnumbered by itself, and the mission is probably suicidal. In another development, while Uncle Scott and Ben are working to disrupt the Skitters' transmissions, Ben discovers he is sensitive to certain frequencies in a way which might be used as a weapon against the Skitters. Despite the negatives, Weaver insists that he still wants to press the attack, defending his determination to do so by pointing out that if alien reinforcements are indeed coming soon, and the other militias have been destroyed, that they might never get another chance to hit the aliens. It's either that or sit around and wait for death. Even if the assault is suicidal, they have to try, and their sacrifice will inspire other resistance fighters and their children to keep fighting the aliens, no matter how long it takes. Weaver apologizes for hiding the full extent of the bad news from the 2nd Mass, then asks for 50 volunteer fighters, who now know what they are facing. Many volunteer, including Pope, and the group set off hoping that the reinforcements might still show up. Their plan is to fight their way to the support-pillars of the alien command tower in central Boston, then use Pope's home-made demolition charges to take it out.

The number of those killed in the first massacre (January 25) was 56, including women and children. Some of the victims were tortured prior to their death. On March 28 at least eleven men were executed, and on April 13 at least six more men were killed. Around 73 of the remaining inhabitants of the village were deported to the Soviet Union at the end of April, 1946, while 15 final inhabitants were \\"resettled\\" within People's Republic of Poland during Operation Vistula in 1947. At that point the village ceased to exist. Killings On 23 January 1946, a force of the People's Army of Poland, numbering around 80 soldiers, which was tracking down partisans of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) encountered and destroyed small groups of UPA partisans in the area. However, when they tried to enter the village of Zawadka Morochowska they were met with stiffer resistance from the Ukrainian partisans who had withdrawn to the village. As a result, the Polish Communist forces had to retreat. In the process they abandoned two supply wagons as well as several mortars. Additionally, some of the sources related to the massacre emphasize that the casualties suffered by the unit were part of the reason for the killing that took place two days later. On 25 January, at which point the UPA partisans had left the area, the Polish forces surrounded the village and then proceed to burn it down while murdering from 56 to 78 of its inhabitants, including women and children. There is no evidence that any of the villagers had been part of, or had any connections to the UPA. Records from interwar Poland indicate that the ethnic Ukrainians of the village had friendly contacts with the local Poles and the nearby Polish villages. Some of the victims were tortured before their death. The unit of the communist Polish army responsible for the massacre was the 34th Regiment of the LWP, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Stanis≈Çaw Pluto. According to UPA sources, subsequently some of the Polish soldiers from the 2nd battalion of the 34th regiment were captured by the UPA and gave statements to the effect that the majority of the killings were carried out by the 3rd battalion of the 34th Regiment of the LWP.

Macdonald was an advocate for the consolidated school movement, which involved closing small rural schools and amalgamating them into one large school. The school's first students travelled by horse-drawn van and benefited from qualified teachers and an expanded curriculum that included nature study, manual training and domestic science. The school also featured a chemistry laboratory, auditorium, indoor plumbing and individual garden plots for each student. History At the turn of the century (1904), the major problems facing Canadian educators was the so-called \\"rural school problem\\". More importantly, the population in country schools was declining as students were attracted by the opportunities and glamour offered by city life. Curriculum in rural schools did little to encourage the future farmer since subjects were still based on the traditional combination of literature and the classics. At the same time, farmer's groups throughout North America were calling for equal opportunities for rural and urban children and a curriculum more scaled to the practical needs of farm life. Various solutions were sought to upgrade rural education, such as adding agriculture to the curriculum, and establishing closer ties with colleges like the Ontario Agricultural College in Guelph. However, the most successful solution was found in the consolidation of rural school districts. The movement began in the United States with the passing of an act in New York in 1864, quickly spread throughout New England, and found its greatest success in Ohio, Indiana and Iowa. Consolidation involved the concentration of a number of small, scattered country schools into one large school consisting of three to five rooms; the provision of a well-qualified teaching staff; and the transporting of students to and from the school in horse-drawn vans. In Canada, the earliest attempt at solving the rural school problem occurred late in 1902, Sir William Macdonald, the Montreal tobacco manufacturer and philanthropist, made available to Professor James Robertson, at that time Dominion Agricultural and Dairying Commissioner, a sum of money which was to be used for the introduction of practical work into country schools of Eastern Canada. The objectives of the \\"Macdonald Movement\\" were twofold ‚Äì to encourage the consolidation of rural schools, and to promote the development of those subjects most compatible with agrarian life, namely nature study, manual training and domestic science. The first step by the Macdonald Rural Schools Fund was to establish model school gardens at five rural schools in each of the five eastern provinces. The students were responsible for the care of their own garden plots of approximately 36 square feet each. They learned practical lessons of proper seed selection, rotation of crops, and protection of crops from weeds, insects and disease. Supporters at the time hailed the school garden experiment, and one 1905 report described it as a means to \\"cultivate the sense of ownership and a social spirit of co-operation and mutual respect for one another's rights.\\" Coinciding with the school garden experiment was the construction of four model consolidated schools at Middleton, Nova Scotia in 1903; at Kingston, New Brunswick and Guelph the following year; and at Hillsborough, Prince Edward Island in 1905. Macdonald agreed to subsidize the schools during the first three years of their existence and it was hoped that after that time, funding would be assumed by either the province or local bodies once the worthiness of the experiment had been demonstrated. From the beginning, rural school trustees saw the advantages of consolidation. It was clear that regular and increased attendance would be assured, and by conveying pupils in horse-drawn vans children would be less exposed to damp and cold weather. There was also the advantage of a more sophisticated classroom situation and children could now progress through the various grades within their peer group. The Macdonald Fund set an example as well for the teachers who were carefully selected and then sent to special courses at Columbia and Cornell Universities. In general, the costs of education a student were lower than before consolidation, since students stayed at school longer and general attendance increased ‚Äì in some cases as high as 90 percent from as low as 60 percent before consolidation. Notwithstanding these advantages, the rural public in eastern Canada did not immediately embrace the ideals of the Macdonald Movement. Although most believed that the results of consolidation were positive, some districts voted to return to the one room schoolhouse, since the expense of transporting children produced an increase in their annual operating costs. Consolidation was more successful in the prairies where provincial departments of education in the West provided the initial stimulus and funding required rather than relying on the Macdonald Fund. Guelph The Macdonald Consolidated School at Guelph was typical of the schools established by Sir William in eastern Canada. It was built adjacent to the Ontario Agricultural College on a 2 ¬Ω acre site close to Macdonald Institute, which had been a gift from Sir William in 1903. He established the institute to provide women, especially rural women, with a thorough education in the domestic sciences, and as a training centre for teachers. He also paid for Macdonald Hall, built in 1903 as a residence for students who attended courses at the institute. Local school trustees received $38,000 for the property and construction of Macdonald Consolidated School. The building was designed by George M. Miller who headed one of the busiest agricultural firms in Toronto at the turn of the century. A native of Port Hope, Ontario, Miller began practicing in Toronto as an architect in 1885. He designed many churches and public buildings throughout Ontario during his long career, his most notable accomplishment being the Lillian Massey Food Sciences Building at the University of Toronto (1908‚Äì12). He was also involved in the designs for Massey Hall as part of the numbers projects he worked on for the Massey family. His connection with the University of Guelph campus began in 1901 when his firm was contracted to design the Massey Library, and following this, Macdonald Institute. Both buildings are imposing and noteworthy for their stylistic eclecticism and rich terracotta colouration. Unfortunately, the amount provided by the fund for the construction of Macdonald Consolidated School was not sufficient to allow the construction of a building of similar stature. In planning the new school, the trustees had underestimated costs and consequently had to cut corners. Design changes made without Sir William's knowledge resulted in a plain building with a utilitarian fa√ßade and simple peak-roofed porch over the front entrance. He was so enraged on opening day in 1904 that he refused to leave his carriage. Two hours later he boarded a train and never again returned to Guelph. A few years later, the school trustees raised enough money to embellish the fa√ßade with a neo-classical wooden porch that boasted Doric columns and the school's name proudly inscribed across the front. Since then, the exterior of the building has remained the same. The school was constructed of brick on a dressed stone foundation. The basement contained four large lunch and playrooms and on the first floor there were classrooms, a manual training room and a ladies' waiting room. Additional classrooms were on the second floor plus a laboratory for chemistry and nature study, domestic science room and principal's office. An assembly hall to seat 200 with stage and dressing rooms was on the third floor. The grounds contained a large garden, with individual plots for each student, a class plot and plots devoted to experimental work. At the time of opening in November 1904, four school sections to the north and south of the school had agreed to consolidate. A fifth section was admitted to the consolidation a few months later. The staff consisted of the principal, Mr. Hodson, and three teachers; the enrollment totaled 175. The school was managed by a board of fifteen ‚Äì three from each section, and trustees' meetings were held monthly. Rural pupils attending Macdonald Consolidated were transported to school in six horse-drawn vans, while those in town came by street car. During its early years, the school was noted for its nature garden, the produce of which was canned and bottled in the domestic science classes. Much of the produce helped to provide the hot lunches which were another distinctive feature of the school. The course of study covered regular public school subjects and some high school work, in addition to manual training, domestic science, agriculture, music, drawing and watercolours. Classes at Macdonald Consolidated were frequently used for practice teaching throughout the period when a normal school program was offered at the Macdonald Institute. Students would come to the school to teach various forms of domestic science, such as cooking and sewing. A similar liaison was held with the Ontario Agricultural College ‚Äì while the girls were being trained in home economics, the boys would receive lessons in manual training from male instructors from the college.

Unadilla and Onaquaga (spelled \\"Oghwaga\\" on the map) are marked in blue. The Raid on Unadilla and Onaquaga was a series of military operations by Continental Army forces and New York militia against the Iroquois towns of Unadilla and Onaquaga in what is now upstate New York. In early October 1778, more than 250 men under the command of Lieutenant Colonel William Butler of the 4th Pennsylvania Regiment descended on the two towns (which had been abandoned because of their advance) and destroyed them, razing most of the buildings and taking or destroying provisions, including the people's winter stores. They conducted the raid in retaliation for a series of raids on frontier communities led by Mohawk chief Joseph Brant and British-supported Loyalists during the spring and summer of 1778. Unadilla was located in what is now the Village of Unadilla, Town of Unadilla, Otsego County, and Onaquaga was located in what is now the Town of Windsor, Broome County. Background With the failure of British General John Burgoyne's campaign to the Hudson after the Battles of Saratoga in October 1777, the American Revolutionary War in upstate New York became a frontier war.Graymont, pp. 155‚Äì156 British leaders in the Province of Quebec supported Loyalist and Native American partisan fighters with supplies and armaments.Kelsay, p. 212 During the winter of 1777‚Äì78 Mohawk leader Joseph Brant and other British-allied Indians developed plans to attack frontier settlements in New York and Pennsylvania.Graymont, p. 160 In February 1778 Brant established a base of operations at Onaquaga (present-day Windsor, New York). He recruited a mix of Iroquois and Loyalists estimated to number between two and three hundred by the time he began his campaign in May.Barr, p. 150Kelsay, p. 216Graymont, p. 165 One of his objectives was to acquire provisions for his forces and those of John Butler, who was planning operations in the Susquehanna River valley.Halsey, p. 207 Brant began his campaign in late May with a raid on Cobleskill, and raided other frontier communities throughout the summer.Graymont, pp. 165‚Äì167 George Clinton, portrait by Ezra Ames The frontier settlers had difficulty responding to raids. The local militia were supported by some Continental Army regiments stationed in the area, but these forces generally could not muster in time to catch the raiders before they disappeared, and had to return to their farms to produce crops and save livestock.Halsey, pp. 207‚Äì217 New York Governor George Clinton and militia commander Abraham Ten Broeck considered operations against the principal Iroquois bases, Onaquaga and Unadilla, used by the raiders, early in the campaign, but it was not until an attack by Brant on the settlement of German Flatts (present-day Herkimer) on September 17 that an expedition was organized.Barr, p. 151 In response to calls from Governor Clinton, General George Washington authorized the use of Continental Army forces, assigning the operation to Lieutenant Colonel William Butler (no relation to the Loyalist Butlers) of the 4th Pennsylvania Regiment.Barr, p. 152 On September 20 Butler sent scouts to investigate conditions at the two towns. They returned with reports that Unadilla had a population of 300 and Onaquaga 400.Halsey, p. 234 Expedition On October 2 Butler led a force of 267 men (214 Continentals and 53 state militia) from Fort Schoharie up the Schoharie valley toward the two villages. Late in the day on October 6 the force reached the Unadilla area. Butler sent scouting parties out to take prisoners from outlying farms. As the force cautiously advanced toward the town, one of the scouts returned with a prisoner who reported that the community had been abandoned, with most of the inhabitants fleeing to Onaquaga. Butler detached some of his men to destroy the town while he marched with the rest toward Onaquaga. They reached the town late on October 8, and found it abandoned also, apparently in great haste. Butler and his men spent the next two days destroying the towns. Butler described Unadilla as \\"the finest Indian town I ever saw; on the both sides of the River there was about 40 good houses, Square logs, Shingles & stone Chimneys, good Floors, glass windows &c.;\\"Graymont, p. 181 All the homes were burned, as was the town's saw and grist mill, which was the only one in the area. Butler reported taking 49 horses and 52 head of cattle, and destroyed 4,000 bushels of grain.Halsey, pp. 235‚Äì236 Operations were complicated by heavy rains that raised the water levels of the Susquehanna; Butler's men had to build rafts to cross some of the river's tributaries to reach parts of the town. By October 16 the expedition returned to Schoharie.Graymont, p. 182 Aftermath 19th century depiction of the Cherry Valley massacre While the raid was taking place, Brant and his force had been raiding frontier settlements in the upper Delaware River valley.Halsey, p. 237 The Indians in his force were especially upset at the destruction of the two towns, as were Seneca warriors who joined with Brant in the ruins of Unadilla a few days later. This anger contributed to the severity of the actions when a joint British-Seneca-Mohawk force attacked Cherry Valley, and were reported to massacre 30 noncombatants.Barr, pp. 153‚Äì154 The severity of the frontier war in 1778 led to calls by the Continental Congress for a response.Graymont, p. 192 In 1779 General Washington organized a major Continental Army expedition into the Iroquois lands. Led by Generals John Sullivan and James Clinton, the Sullivan Expedition destroyed villages, crops, and winter stores, driving most of the British-supporting Iroquois out of their lands. Despite its apparent success of the expedition, the frontier war continued with renewed vigor in the following years.Barr, pp. 155‚Äì161 Notes References  * Category:1778 in the United States Category:Conflicts in 1778 Unadilla Unadilla Unadilla Category:Broome County, New York Category:Battles of the American Revolutionary War in New York (state) Category:Otsego County, New York Category:1778 in New York (state) ","title":"Raid on Unadilla and Onaquaga"},{"id":"34518435","text":"Ghinda Masjid (Mosque) The forefathers of the Taroa people were two brothers zed and zebed, descendants of Kerosh (Quraysh) and Manneja (Muawiyah), who lived in Arabia. Later on they separated: zebed remained in his country of origin, while zed crossed the Red Sea, landed on African soil and settled on the Buri Peninsula, south of Massawa (now in Eritrea). From him were born Haranreway, Hatsotay, Toray, Schiahai, Adalie (Adaglie), Mensaay, and Mereyay. The first of these formed a branch called Haranrewa; the others a second branch with name of six people: Hazo, Taroa, Schiahay, Adallye, Mensaay and Mareya. Migration The new settlers were Saho who migrated from the coast to Haigat. A migration led the same groups of Saho to the plateau where they took up Tigrigna or Tigre as their language. The story continues to narrate how the Mensa and Marya left their brothers and moved towards the area where the sun sets and then moved up to Haigat. There they went in different directions. Mensaay settled at Haigat and his descendants were called Mensa, while the Mareyay settled at Erota and his descendants were called Marya. The existing population, called Tigre was subdued and Mensa and Marya became the ruling classes (Shimagele) in the area. The area mentioned above was located in the Central Eastern Highlands of Eritrea and stretched towards the north. The language spoken by the people was Tigre, closely related to the ancient Ge'ez language. Other related groups, such as the Bet Juk, settled north of Mensa. The Mensa were divided into two groups: The Beit Abrehe, with their main center at Habna (Geleb) and the Biet Eshhaqan, with their center at Mihlab. thumb Mensa‚Äô The father of the tribes of Mensa‚Äô, Marya Tselim and Maria Keyeh of Senhit, Hazo and Taroa of Akele Guzai came from Arabia, through Yemen and they still remember the kinship. They also claim to be descended of the Banu-Umayyad family. thumb thumb Taroa (Tor'uwa), (153000in 1931), the most northerly of the Saho, inhabit the territory between the rivers Haddas and Algede, being nomadic between the Hamasen and the coast. The Taroa possess large herds of oxen, In origin they are a mixture of Ge'ez and Tigre-speaking peoples with Saho, They were originally Tigre Speaking but have changed to Saho although Tigre is also spoken. They claim descent from an immigrant Arab. There are two fractions, the Bait Sahar (or Sahar Are) and the Bait Mose (or Moset 'Are), the second bilingual. Many Taroa families emigrate among the peoples of Samhar. Assaborta The Tigre/Saho speaking Taroa people were a section of the Assaborta tribe, which was well known for its People's passionate dispositions and hard -core integrity. The Assaborta had stubbornly resisted their incorporation into the Great Coptic Tradition when they settled some centuries ago in the area now known as Tigray Province. As a result, they moved northward, finally settling in arid semi-desert areas bordering the Christian settlement in Akelle-Guzai. The Taroa nomads, Muslim and pastoralist by vocation, settled adjacent to the Tsenadegle district.

Sampledelia features \\"disorienting, perception-warping\\" manipulations of audio samples or found sounds via techniques such as chopping, looping or stretching. Sampladelic techniques have been applied prominently in styles of electronic music and hip hop, such as trip hop, jungle, post-rock, and plunderphonics. Characteristics Sampledelia describes a variety of styles which involve the use of samplers to manipulate and play back appropriated sounds, often drawn from outside familiar contexts or from foreign sources. Common techniques include chopping, looping, or time- stretching, the use of found sounds, and a focus on timbre. Artists frequently join musical fragments from different sources and eras, emphasizing rhythm, noise, and repetition over conventional melodic and harmonic development. The 1990s also saw computer-based sampling develop, with sounds treated within the \\"virtual space\\" of the hard disk. Samples may be used for both their musical qualities and cultural associations. According to critic Simon Reynolds, sampledelic music expands upon the recording methods of 1960s psychedelia, which saw artists abandon \\"naturalistic\\" recording practices in favor of using studio-based techniques and effects to create sounds that could not be achieved through live performance. Reynolds identifies two contrasting tendencies amongst sampladelic artists: postmodernist versus modernist, with the former viewing sampling as a form of collage and pop art referentiality, and the latter approaching it as an update of musique concr√®te's techniques of sonic manipulation and transformation. Theorist Kodwo Eshun has described sampledelia as a kind of mythology in which \\"sounds have detached themselves from sources [and] substitute themselves for the world,\\" inducing an experience of \\"synthetic defamiliarisation.\\" Origins The E-mu Emulator II (1984) was an early, cheap digital sampler used by 1980s hip hop producers. Early sampling practices date back to late-1960s turntablism and scratching in dance music, including Jamaican dub music scenes.Nicholas Collins, Julio d' Escrivan Rinc√≥n (2007), The Cambridge Companion to Electronic Music, page 49, Cambridge University Press Critic Simon Reynolds notes that early sampling techniques were used by art rock artists such as Brian Eno, Kate Bush and Peter Gabriel (the latter two via the expensive Fairlight CMI), with Eno and David Byrne's My Life in the Bush of Ghosts (1981) a landmark in the genre.A Talking Head of His Time-Music-The Stranger However, he states that the beginning of the sampledelic era was marked by the acquisition of cheaper samplers such as the E-mu Emulator and Ensoniq Mirage by rap producers. According to scholar Joanna Teresa Demers, the development of techno in early 1980s Detroit saw musicians utilize inexpensive samplers to incorporate nonreferential samples. Sampling was incorporated into hip hop's DJ- and studio-based approaches by artists such as Mantronix, Eric B & Rakim, and The Art of Noise, and by 1987 UK acts such as Coldcut, M/A/R/R/S, S'Express were creating breakbeat-driven sample collages blending the feel of hip hop and house. Late-1980s hip hop albums such as It Takes A Nation of Millions To Hold Us Back (1988) by Public Enemy, 3 Feet High & Rising (1989) by De La Soul, and Paul's Boutique (1989) by the Beastie Boys exemplified the sampledelic production style, appropriating sounds from varied sources before copyright law made such an approach more difficult. In 1985, John Oswald coined the term \\"plunderphonics\\" to describe an approach which framed sampling as a \\"self-conscious practice\\" which interrogated notions of originality, identity, and \\"the death of the author.\\" Later developments Early sample- based music often involved blatant interpolations of known music, prompting criticism and copyright concerns, but in the 1990s the style grew more subtle, with artists obscuring their sources in part to avoid legal repercussions. Artists such as A Guy Called Gerald, Techno Animal, and the Young Gods approached sampling with a more modernist outlook than Oswald. According to theorist Kodwo Eshun, sampledelic techniques were used by artists such as Tricky, Ultramagnetic MCs, and RZA of Wu-Tang Clan and Gravediggaz. 1990s acts such as Position Normal and Saint Etienne would also take a sampledelic approach to explore forgotten elements of English culture. Albums such as Throbbing Pouch (1995) by Wagon Christ and Endtroducing..... (1996) by DJ Shadow would also be prominent 1990s works in the style. Australian group The AvalanchesThe Avalanches Announce First-Ever North American Tour-Paste Magazine extended DJ Shadow's sampledelic approach on their 2000 album Since I Left You. In the 21st century, genres such as chillwave pushed sampledelic music into new territory, incorporating retro styles such as yacht rock.

Early life and education Bob Bledsaw was born May 18, 1942, in Decatur, Illinois, and was the son of Walter and Dorothy Bledsaw. He graduated from Lakeview High School and Richland Community College and attended Millikin University. He was employed as an engineer by A.W. Cash, Grigoleit, Essex Wire, General Electric and Zexel Illinois, contributing to the development of quadraphonic sound systems. Career In 1975, Bob Bledsaw began to run a campaign using the original Dungeons & Dragons rules, after being asked for help by Bill Owen and a group of other friends who had unsuccessfully tried to run the game four times; he started his adventure in a fantasy campaign set in Middle-earth, but moved the campaign to a realm of his own design - the City State of the Invincible Overlord - rather than sacrifice the integrity of Tolkien's world. When Bledsaw was laid off from his job at General Electric in 1975, he decided to form a company to create supplements for D&D; players, and with Bill Owen he went to seek permission from TSR. Bledsaw and Owen showed their City-State material to Dave Arneson, Gary Gygax, and other TSR staff, who told them they could publish supplements to D&D; if they wanted to. With this casual licensing agreement, they created a large map of Bledsaw's City-State, first selling copies of the map and subscriptions to Judges Guild's bimonthly play aids publication. In 1976, with partner Bill Owen he founded The Judges Guild Game Co., which manufactured role-playing games and supplies. Bledsaw and Owen became full-time employees of Judges Guild in 1977; Owen was also working full-time for his family business, so he left Judges Guild in the fall of 1977 and sold his shares to Bledsaw. By spring of 1978, Judges Guild left Bledsaw's living room and moved to a real office. Bledsaw hoped to use his connection with Chuck Anshell - who was friends with one of J.R.R. Tolkien's sons - to acquire a license to Middle-earth, but waited too long out of respect for Tolkien's passing in 1973, and thus Iron Crown Enterprises got the license instead. In 1978 Bledsaw sent Gary Gygax hundreds of pages of notes about campaigns, some of which was incorporated into the original Dungeon Masters Guide as appendices. When TSR started publishing their own adventures in 1978 beginning with the G-series, the D-series, and Tomb of Horrors, Bledsaw felt this was in violation of TSR's previous agreement with Judges Guild. By 1985, Judges Guild had stopped publishing new material after several distributors and retailers went out of business owing Judges Guild money. Early in 1999, Judges Guild - led by Bob Bledsaw - returned on the internet at judgesguild.com, and began selling original Judges Guild products which had been warehoused for 15 years, and also started taking new subscriptions for Pegasus magazine. Bledsaw and James Mishler formed a new company called Adventure Games Publishing. Bob Bledsaw died on April 19, 2008, from cancer.

Current elected officials Howard Marklein is the senator serving the 17th district. He was elected to a four- year term in 2014. The area of the 17th Senate District contains three State Assembly Districts: * The 49th (represented by Travis Tranel) * The 50th (represented by Edward Brooks) * The 51st (represented by Todd Novak) The district is also located partly within Wisconsin's 2nd congressional district, which is represented by U.S. Representative Mark Pocan, and partly within Wisconsin's 3rd congressional district, which is represented by U.S. Representative Ron Kind. Past senators The boundaries of districts have changed over history. Previous politicians of a specific numbered district have represented different geographic areas, due to redistricting. At statehood, the district was one of two for Racine County. It was represented by: * Philo White, 1848 (Democrat) * Victor Willard, 1849-1850 (Free Soiler) * Stephen O. Bennett, 1851-1852 (Free Soiler) For the 1853 session, the Senate had been expanded, and the 17th District was now Rock County. It was represented by: * Ezra Miller (legislator), 1853-1854 (Democrat) * James Sutherland, 1855-1858 (Republican) * Zebulon P. Burdick, 1859-1860 (Republican) * Ezra Foot, 1861-1862 (Republican) * William A. Lawrence, 1863-1866 (Republican/Union) * S. J. Todd, 1867-1868 (Union) * Charles G. Williams, 1869-1872 (Republican) * Horatio Davis, 1873-1876 (Republican) * Hamilton Richardson, 1877-1882 (Republican)Heg, J. E., ed. The Blue Book of the State of Wisconsin 1883 Madison, 1883; pp. 177-253 * Simon Lord, 1883-1886 (Republican) * Allen P. Lovejoy, 1887-1890 (Republican) The Senate was redistricted after the 1890 census, and the new 17th District included (part of Rock County (the Towns of Avon, Beloit, Clinton, Newark, Plymouth, Spring Valley, and Turtle, Wisconsin; the Village of Clinton, Wisconsin, and the City of Beloit), and all of Green and Lafayette counties). The Senate was re- districted anew in 1901; the new 17th still included all of Green and Lafayette counties, plus Iowa County; but none of Rock. The new 17th was represented by: * Richard Burdge, 1891-1894 (Republican) * Henry Putnam, 1895-1898 (Republican) * Harry C. Martin, 1899-1914 (Republican) The Senate was re-districted again in 1901; the new 17th still included all of Green and Lafayette counties, plus Iowa County; but none of Rock. Harry Martin continued to serve the new 17th through 1914. He was succeeded by: * Platt Whitman, 1915-1918 (Republican) * Oscar R. Olson, 1919-1922 (Republican) * Olaf H. Johnson, 1923-1926 (Republican) * Charles W. Hutchison, 1927-1930 (Republican) * William Olson, 1931-1932 (Republican) * George Engebretson, 1933-1938 (Republican) * Carl Lovelace, 1939-1942 (Republican) * Melvin Olson, 1943‚Äì1954 (Republican) In 1954, the Senate was redistricted, and Grant County was added to the district. The Senators from the new 17th were: * Robert S. Travis, 1955‚Äì1962 Republican) * Gordon Roseleip, 1962-1974 Republican) After the 1960 census, the districts were revised, and the Wisconsin Supreme Court intervened; on May 14, 1964, they promulgated a new legislative map. The new 17th added Richland County; but Roseleip remained in office. In April 1972, the Senate was redistricted, and new 17th regained five Rock County townships (and the cities within their boundaries) which had been part of the district in the 1890s: Avon, Magnolia, Newark, Plymouth and Spring Valley; plus Dane County's Black Earth and Mazomanie. This new 17th elected: * Kathryn Morrison, 1975-1978 (first Democrat from the 17th since 1854) * Richard Kreul, 1979‚Äì1991 (Republican) * Dale Schultz, 1991-2014 (Republican) Wisconsin Blue Book, 1991-92 edition, Statistics: History, pages 657-666. Before the 1982 election, a redistricting cost the 17th portions of Grant, Green and Richland counties, while adding a bit more of Rock County and for the first time a tier of southern Sauk County from Spring Green to Sauk City. Richard Kreul remained in office until he resigned in July 1991 to take a position in the Thompson administration; Dale Schultz was elected to fill his position. New district boundaries were ordered by a federal court in June 1992; the new 17th district reached further north, with more of Sauk County and a big chunk of Juneau County, while losing all of Dane, Green and Rock counties. The 2011 redistricting added back a bit of Green County, extended westward into Monroe County for the first time, and lost parts of Sauk and Iowa Counties.

Mission and History  The US Departments of Education, Justice, and Health and Human Services funded the Safe Schools/Healthy Students Initiative in 1999 in response to the school shootings in the late 1990s, including the Paducah, Kentucky school shooting, the Jonesburo, Arkansas school shooting, and the Springfield, Oregon school shooting. Since 1999 the SS/HS Initiative has awarded grants totaling more than $2.1 billion to over 300 local education agencies in a range of urban, suburban, and rural communities. The SS/HS Initiative addresses five elements within each site: * Safe school environments and violence prevention activities. * Alcohol and other drug prevention activities. * Student behavioral, social, and emotional supports. * Mental health services. * Early childhood social and emotional learning programs.  Impact  The White House Office released a report in August 2011 citing the Safe Schools/Healthy Students Initiative as one of the three model programs that uses a community approach to prevent violence.

Tamura was trained by the All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling (AJW) promotion, made her debut in September 1994 and worked for the promotion for three years, winning the AJW Junior Championship, before taking part in a mass exodus led by Kyoko Inoue and following her to the newly founded NEO Japan Ladies Pro-Wrestling promotion. Recognized as the \\"Ace\\" of NEO, Tamura performed with the promotion from its first event to the last, in the process becoming its most accomplished wrestler, winning the NEO Single and NWA Women's Pacific Championships a record seven times and the NEO Tag Team Championship three times. All in all, Tamura held the NEO Single and NWA Women's Pacific Championships for 2,074 days and successfully defended them 38 times. After being inducted into the NEO Hall of Fame, Tamura ended her sixteen-year career on December 31, 2010, retiring at the end of NEO's final event. Professional wrestling career =All Japan Women's Pro Wrestling (1994‚Äì1997)= Tamura was trained at the All Japan Women's Pro Wrestling (AJW) dojo and made her debut on September 15, 1994, in a match against Kaoru Kanayama. Tamura won her first championship on June 27, 1995, defeating Misae Watanabe for the vacant AJW Junior Championship. After a fourteen-month reign, Tamura lost the title to Tomoko Miyaguchi on September 1, 1996. The following year, Tamura, along with several key wrestlers in AJW, took part in a mass exodus led by Kyoko Inoue, and left the promotion, which was struggling with financial difficulties. =Independent circuit (1997‚Äì1999)= After parting ways with AJW, Tamura affiliated herself with Kyoko Inoue, who had purchased a dojo and was planning to start her own promotion. However, the promotion, NEO Japan Ladies Pro Wrestling, would not start running regular shows until over two years later. Meanwhile, Tamura made appearances for several independent promotions, including Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling (FMW), Hyper Visual Fighting Arsion and Oz Academy. On July 19, 1997, Tamura made a guest appearance for Gaea Japan, defeating Toshie Uematsu for the WCW Women's Cruiserweight Championship, a title also recognized by American promotion World Championship Wrestling (WCW). Tamura would hold the title for two months, before losing it to Sugar Sato on September 20, in her second Gaea Japan appearance. =NEO Japan Ladies Pro Wrestling (2000‚Äì2010)= In 2000, NEO Japan Ladies Pro- Wrestling began running shows regularly, starting with an event on May 31, where Tamura and Azumi Hyuga wrestled Misae Genki and Ran Yu-Yu to a thirty- minute time limit draw in the main event. In NEO, Tamura reinvented herself as \\"Tamura-sama\\", adopting the character of an arrogant villain. On August 24, Tamura represented NEO at a National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) event in Wildwood, New Jersey, United States, where she defeated Nicole Bass to become the inaugural NWA Women's Pacific Champion. The title was from the start unified with the NEO Single Championship and, although both championships were represented by their own belts, they remained together for their entire history. Tamura made her first title defense back in Japan on September 22, defeating Takako Inoue. Before the end of NEO's first year, Tamura also defended the titles against Misae Genki on October 13 and Kyoko Inoue on November 21. On February 11, 2001, Tamura lost the titles to Mima Shimoda in her fourth defense, ending her reign at 171 days. The following May, Tamura made it to the finals of the NEO Japan Cup, before losing to Misae Genki. On December 7, Tamura regained the NEO Single and NWA Women's Pacific Championships by defeating champion Lioness Asuka, Kyoko Inoue, Mima Shimoda, Misae Genki and Ran Yu-Yu in a six-way elimination match. After successful defenses against Misae Genki, Yuki Miyazaki and Kyoko Inoue, Tamura lost the titles to Etsuko Mita on April 13, 2002. However, the following month, Tamura defeated Mima Shimoda to win the 2002 NEO Japan Cup, which earned her another title shot on June 8, where Tamura defeated Mita to win the NEO Single and NWA Women's Pacific Championships for the third time. Tamura's third reign ended on October 14, 2002, when the HJPG (Horipro Joshi Puroresu Group) stable stole her belt, which was then declared vacant and put up for grabs in a tournament. On November 10, Tamura defeated Kyoko Inoue and Mima Shimoda in a three-way elimination tournament final match to win the vacant titles for the fourth time. On February 2, 2003, Tamura lost the titles to Inoue in her first defense, a Two Out of Three Falls match. Just three months later on May 5, Tamura defeated Azumi Hyuga to win the NEO Single and NWA Women's Pacific Championships for already the fifth time. In September, Tamura attempted to become a double champion, when she teamed with Ofune in the Itabashi Tag Team Championship tournament. Tamura and Ofune made it all the way to the finals of the tournament, before losing to the NEO Machineguns (Tanny Mouse and Yuki Miyazaki). Tamura's fifth NEO Single and NWA Women's Pacific Championship reign of 314 days ended on March 12, 2004, when she was defeated by Momoe Nakanishi. On August 14, Tamura took part in a unique match, when she faced 31 other wrestlers in a gauntlet match. On September 20, Tamura defeated The Bloody to win Trans World Federation's (TWF) World Women's Championship, a title owned by the JDStar promotion. On December 19, she put the title on the line a title vs. title match against the NEO Single and NWA Women's Pacific Champion Misae Genki; the match ended in a one-hour time limit draw, meaning that both champions retained their titles. The rivalry between Tamura and Genki continued a year later on December 11, 2005, when Tamura defeated Genki to win the NEO Single and NWA Women's Pacific Championships for the sixth time. Tamura would hold the titles for all of 2006, successfully defending it against Mima Shimoda, Ran Yu-Yu, Toshie Uematsu, Kyoko Inoue, Hikaru, Kayoko Haruyama, Chikayo Nagashima, Kyoko Kimura, Mariko Yoshida and Azumi Hyuga. On June 24, 2006, Tamura returned to the United States to compete in ChickFight V in San Francisco, California. After being eliminated from the tournament in the semifinals by Cheerleader Melissa, Tamura went on to successfully defend the NEO Single and NWA Women's Pacific Championships against MsChif. On August 19, Tamura and Haruka Matsuo defeated the Oz Academy team of Carlos Amano and Chikayo Nagashima to win the Mid Summer Tag Tournament VI. The following day, Tamura participated in Wrestle Expo 2006 in Odaiba, where she took part in the World Women's Wrestling Classics (WWWC) Tournament, defeating MsChif in the finals to not only win the tournament, but to also retain the NEO Single and NWA Women's Pacific Championships. Tamura's domination continued well into 2007, with successful NEO Single and NWA Women's Pacific Championship defenses against Ayako Hamada, Emi Sakura and Vanessa the Mountain. On July 16, Tamura and Emi Sakura defeated Haruka Matsuo and Misae Genki to win the NEO Tag Team Championship, making Tamura a double champion. However, Tamura's and Sakura's reign would end just thirteen days later, when they were defeated by Ayako Hamada and Kaoru Ito. Finally, on September 17, 2007, Tamura lost the NEO Single and NWA Women's Pacific Championships to former tag team partner Haruka Matsuo. Tamura's reign of 645 days and fifteen successful title defenses are both unparalleled records in NEO's history. Before the end of 2007, Tamura would once again wear gold in NEO, when she regained the NEO Tag Team Championship from Hamada and Ito on November 4, this time teaming with old rival Misae Genki. They would lose the title to the NEO Machineguns on March 2, 2008. Afterwards, Tamura began feuding with the Revolucion Amandla stable of Atsuko Emoto, Kyoko Kimura and Tomoka Nakagawa, often teaming with the likes of Aya Yuki, Etsuko Mita and Misae Genki. During late 2008, the feud turned into a three-way battle, when Passion Red (Nanae Takahashi, Kana and Natsuki‚òÜTaiyo) entered NEO. In February 2009, Tamura found a new tag team partner in Ayumi Kurihara. The team, dubbed \\"The Soul to One\\", would receive their first shot at the NEO Tag Team Championship on March 8, but was defeated by the defending champions, Revolucion Amandla's Atsuko Emoto and Kyoko Kimura. On May 5, Tamura won the NEO Single and NWA Women's Pacific Championships for the seventh time by defeating former tag team partner Emi Sakura with a new finishing maneuver, Mount Cook. Approaching July's Mid Summer Tag Tournament VIII, Kurihara turned her back on the new NEO Single and NWA Women's Pacific Champion by accepting former rival Kana's request to become her tag team partner for the tournament. This was followed by Emi Sakura and Aya Yuki also declining an offer to team with Tamura, instead choosing other partners. Finally, Fuka accepted Tamura's offer to become her partner for the tournament. During the tournament Tamura gained a measure of revenge on both Yuki and Kurihara, when she and Fuka first eliminated the team of Yuki and Minori Makiba in the first round and then Kurihara and Kana in the semifinals. However, in the finals of the tournament, Tamura and Fuka were defeated by Emi Sakura and Nanae Takahashi. This led to a NEO Single and NWA Women's Pacific Championship match on September 20, where Tamura successfully defended the titles against Takahashi. On December 31, the reunited Tamura and Ayumi Kurihara defeated Nanae Takahashi and Kana of Passion Red for the NEO Tag Team Championship. They would make their first title defense on February 14, 2010, defeating Revolucion Amandla representatives Kyoko Kimura and Tomoka Nakagawa. On May 5, 2010, following the departure of Kyoko Inoue, NEO Japan Ladies Pro Wrestling, which was celebrating its tenth anniversary, announced that it would cease its operations after the year-end show on December 31. The announcement was followed by Tamura, Tanny Mouse and Yuki Miyazaki, dubbed the NEO3, all announcing that the event would also feature their final professional wrestling matches. After successful Tag Team Championship defenses against the teams of Seven Star Sisters (Hiroyo Matsumoto and Misaki Ohata), the Shirai Sisters (Io and Mio), Triple Tails (Io Shirai and Kana), and the NEO Machineguns, Tamura successfully defended the NEO Single and NWA Women's Pacific Championships against Kurihara on October 11. On November 6, Tamura successfully defended the NEO Single and NWA Women's Pacific Championships against longtime rival Kyoko Kimura in a Street Fighting Spirit Death Match. On November 13, Tamura and Kurihara lost the NEO Tag Team Championship to Aya Yuki and Ryo Mizunami. During the next month, Tamura went on a retirement tour across the Japanese independent circuit, which saw her successfully defend the NEO Single and NWA Women's Pacific Championships against Yumi Ohka in Pro Wrestling Wave, Kaori Yoneyama in JWP Joshi Puroresu, and Hikaru Shida in Ice Ribbon. Tamura also successfully defended the titles in NEO against Emi Sakura and Aya Yuki to ensure that she would head to her final night in professional wrestling as the champion. Prior to the event, Tamura was inducted into the NEO Hall of Fame. On December 31, Tamura lost the NEO Single and NWA Women's Pacific Championships to Ayumi Kurihara in her singles retirement match, ending her final reign at 605 days and twelve successful defenses. Later that same night, Tamura, Tanny Mouse and Yuki Miyazaki, the NEO veterans, wrestled NEO rookies Aya Yuki, Mika Iida and Nagisa Nozaki to a ten-minute time limit draw in the final match in not only the careers of Tamura, Mouse and Miyazaki, but also in the history of NEO Japan Ladies Pro Wrestling. Other media Tamura made her acting debut in the 2009 film Three Count, where she played the role of a professional wrestling trainer, working alongside Emi Sakura, Kyoko Inoue and Hikaru Shida. She also made a cameo appearance as herself in a voice-acting role in episode seven of the 2013 women's wrestling anime television series Wanna Be the Strongest in the World. Personal life On January 1, 2011, Tamura received a diploma in aromatherapy, after passing Japan Aromacoordinator Association's authorization test. She has her own aromatherapy clinic, named Aroma Optimal Corner, in Edogawa, Tokyo.

Flag of the Chinese Soviet Republic from 1927 to 1936. Communist-controlled China (), officially called the Soviet Zone () from 1927 to 1937, and the Liberated Zone () from 1946 to 1949, was the part of the territories of China controlled by the Communist Party of China from 1927 to 1949 during the Republican era and the Chinese Civil War with Nationalist China. There were six soviet areas from 1927 to 1933: the Ching-kang-shan, the Central Soviet in Eastern Jiangxi on the border of Fujian, the O-Yu-Wan (Hubei-Henan-Anhui) Soviet, Hsiang-o-hsi (West Hupei and Hunan), and Hsiang-kan (Hunan-Kiangsi). The first soviet was the Hailufeng Soviet created in 1927. The Central Soviet was the main base of the Communist Party where Communist Party leader Mao Zedong issued a directive on 1 September 1931 for the Central Soviet to mass mobilize the region as a base area. As problems occurred over being able to control territories outside the Central Soviet, by 1933 a full transfer of Communist forces to the Central Soviet was achieved.

Cambridge, England, UK: Cambridge University Press, Pp. 175. Upon the intervention of the Soviet Union against Japan in World War II in 1945, USSR forces invaded the Japanese client state of Manchukuo. Mao Zedong in April and May 1945 had planned to mobilize 150,000 to 250,000 soldiers from across China to work with forces of the Soviet Union in capturing Manchuria.Dieter Heinzig. The Soviet Union and communist China, 1945‚Äì1950: the arduous road to the alliance. M.E. Sharpe, 2004. p. 79. After the end of the war, the communists controlled one-third of the territory of China. Jurisdiction The Communist Party of China Soviets revised marriage law in their territories, issued laws to control the activities of counter- revolutionaries, and established a soviet-style judicial system. The judicial system was considered impressive even by opponents of the Communists, such as General Ch'en Ch'eng, who spoke of its \\"scarcity of cases of embezzlement and corruption\\". History The founding ceremony of the Chinese Soviet Republic on November 7, 1931 in Ruijin, Jiangxi Province. Mao Zedong (second from left in a dark uniform) and Communist Party of China (CPC) officials meeting with United States Ambassador to China, Patrick Hurley (at center - in bow tie), at CPC headquarters in Yan'an, 1945. Map showing the communist-controlled Soviet Zones of China between 1929 and 1935. These areas were re-controlled by the Nationalist government after 1934. On November 7, 1931, the anniversary of the 1917 Russian Bolshevik Revolution, with the help of the Soviet Union, a National Soviet People's Delegates Conference took place in Ruijin, Jiangxi province, which was selected as the national capital. The \\"Chinese Soviet Republic\\" was born, even though the majority of China was still under the control of the national Government of the Republic of China. On that day, they had an open ceremony for the new country, and Mao Zedong and other communists attended the military parade. Because it had its own bank, printed its own money and collected tax through its own tax bureau, it is considered as the beginning of Two Chinas. With Mao Zedong as both head of state (‰∏≠Â§ÆÂü∑Ë°åÂßîÂì°ÊúÉ‰∏ªÂ∏≠, \\"Chairman of the Central Executive Committee\\") and head of government (‰∫∫Ê∞ëÂßîÂì°ÊúÉ‰∏ªÂ∏≠, \\"Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars\\"), the Jiangxi Soviet gradually expanded, reaching a peak of more than 30,000 square kilometres and a population that numbered more than three million, covering considerable parts of two provinces (with Tingzhou in Fujian). Furthermore, its economy was doing better than most areas that were under the control of the Chinese warlords. In addition to the militia and guerilla, its regular Chinese Red Army alone already numbered more than 140,000 by the early 1930s, and they were better armed than most Chinese warlords' armies at the time. For example, not only did the Chinese Red Army already have modern communication means such as telephones, telegraphs and radios which most Chinese warlords' armies still lacked, it was already regularly transmitting wireless messages in codes and breaking nationalist codes. Only Chiang Kai-shek's army could match this formidable communist force. The Nationalist government, led by Chiang Kai-shek, felt threatened by the Soviet republic and led other Chinese warlords to have the National Revolutionary Army besiege the Soviet Republic repeatedly, launching what Chiang and his fellow nationalists called encirclement campaigns at the time, while the communists called their counterattacks counter encirclement campaigns. Chiang Kai-shek's first, second and third encirclement campaigns were defeated by the Chinese Red Army led by Mao. However, after the third counter encirclement campaign, Mao was removed from the leadership and replaced by the Chinese communists returning from the Soviet Union such as Wang Ming, and the command of the Chinese Red Army was handled by a three-man committee that included Wang Ming's associates Otto Braun, the Comintern military advisor, Bo Gu, and Zhou Enlai. The Jiangxi Soviet thus began its inevitable rapid downfall under their policy of extreme leftism and incompetent military command, though the new leadership could not immediately rid itself of Mao's influence which prevailed during the fourth encirclement campaign, and thus saved the communists temporarily. However, as a result of the complete dominance the new communist leadership achieved after the fourth counter encirclement campaign, the Red Army was nearly halved, with most its equipment lost during Chiang's fifth encirclement campaign, started in 1933 and orchestrated by his German advisors, that involved the systematic encirclement of the Jiangxi Soviet region with fortified blockhouses. This method proved to be very effective. In an effort to break the blockade, the Red Army under the orders of the three man committee besieged the forts many times but suffered heavy casualties with little success, resulting in the Jiangxi Soviet shrinking significantly in size due to the Chinese Red Army's disastrous manpower and material losses. On October 10, 1934, the three-man committee communist leadership formally issued the order of the general retreat, and on October 16, 1934, the Chinese Red Army begun what was later known as the Long March, fully abandoning the Jiangxi Soviet. 17 days after the main communist force had already left its base, the nationalists were finally aware that the enemy had escaped after reaching the empty city of Ruijin on November 5, 1934. Contrary to the common erroneous belief, the original destination was He Long's communist base in Hubei, and the final destination Yan'an was not decided on until much later during the Long March, well after the rise of Mao Zedong. To avoid panic, the goal was kept a secret from most people, including Mao Zedong, and the public was told that only a portion of the Chinese Red Army would be engaged in mobile warfare to defeat nationalist forces, and thus this part of the army would be renamed as the ‚ÄúField Army‚Äù. By the fall of 1934, the communists faced total annihilation. This situation had already convinced Mao Zedong and his supporters to believe that the communists should abandon their bases in the Jiangxi Soviet republic. However, the communist leadership stubbornly refused to accept the inevitable failure and still daydreamed of defeating the victorious nationalist forces. The three man committee devised a plan of diversions, and then a regroup after a temporary retreat. Once the regroup was complete, a counterattack would be launched in conjunction with the earlier diversion forces, driving the enemy out of the Jiangxi Soviet. The first movements of the retreating diversion were undertaken by Fang Zhimin. Fang Zhimin and his deputy, Xun Weizhou, were first to break through Kuomintang lines in June, followed by Xiao Ke in August. These movements surprised the Kuomintang, who were numerically superior to the communists at the time and did not expect an attack on their fortified perimeter. However, things did not turn out as the communists had hoped: Fang Zhimin's force was crushed after its initial success, and with Xun Weizhou killed in action, nearly every commander in this force was wounded and captured alive, including Fang Zhimin himself, and all were executed later by the nationalists. The only exception was Su Yu, who managed to escape. Xiao Ke fared no better: although his force initially managed to break through and then reached He Long's communist base in Hubei, but even with their combined forces, they were unable to challenge the far superior nationalist force besieging the Jiangxi Soviet, never to return until the establishment of the People's Republic of China 15 years later. Economy =Bank and currency= On February 1st, 1932, the National Bank of the Chinese Soviet Republic was established with Mao Zemin, the brother of Mao Zedong, as its president. The CSR Central Mint issued three kinds of currency, including the paper bill, the copper coin, and the silver dollar. Banknotes One-yuan bill with Vladimir Lenin's image in the centre. The Central Mint briefly issued both the paper bills and copper coins, but neither circulated for long, primarily because the currency could not be used in the rest of China. The paper bill had \\"Chinese Soviet Republic\\" (‰∏≠ËèØËòáÁ∂≠ÂüÉÂÖ±ÂíåÂúã) printed on the bill in traditional Chinese characters, with a picture of Vladimir Lenin. Copper coin Like the paper bill, the copper coins issued by the Central Mint also had \\"Chinese Soviet Republic\\" (‰∏≠ËèØËòáÁ∂≠ÂüÉÂÖ±ÂíåÂúã) in traditional Chinese characters engraved, and due to the fact that coins last longer than paper bills, these coins were issued and circulated in much greater numbers. However, these coins are currently rarer than the paper bill, mainly because the copper used was in need of cartridges, so these copper coins were recalled and replaced by silver dollars. Silver dollar The largest and most predominant currency produced by the Central Mint was the silver dollar. Unlike the paper bills and the copper coins, the silver dollars had no Communist symbols and instead, they were the direct copy of other silver dollars produced by other mints in China, including the most popular Chinese silver dollar with Yuan Shikai's head engraved, and the eagle silver dollar of the Mexican peso. This and the fact that the coin was made of the precious metal silver, enabled them to be circulated in the rest of China and thus was the trade currency of choice. When the Chinese Red Army's First Front began their Long March in October 1934, the Communist bank was part of the retreating force, with 14 bank employees, over a hundred coolies and a company of soldiers escorting them while they carried all of the money and mint machinery. One of the important tasks of the bank during the Long March whenever the Chinese Red Army stayed in a place for longer than a day was to tell the local population to exchange any Communist paper bills and copper coins to goods and currency used in nationalist controlled regions, so that the local population would not be persecuted by the pursuing nationalists after the Communists had left. After the Zunyi Conference, it was decided that carrying the entire bank on the march was not practical, so on January 29, 1935, at Earth Town (Tucheng, ÂúüÂüé), the bank employees burned all Communist paper bills and mint machinery under order. By the time the Long March had concluded in October 1935, only 8 out of the 14 original employees survived; the other 6 had died along the way. Military =Intelligence= The Communists seemed to have been doomed under the crushing blows of the Nationalists. However, Zhou Enlai had previously achieved a brilliant intelligence success by planting more than a dozen moles in Chiang Kai-shek's inner circle, including at the general headquarters for the nationalist forces at Nanchang. Surprisingly, the most important of the agents, Mo Xiong (Ëé´ÈõÑ), was actually never a communist, but his contribution eventually saved the Communist Party of China and the Chinese Red Army. Under the recommendation of Chiang Kai-shek's secretary-general Yang Yongtai (Ê•äÊ∞∏Ê≥∞), who was unaware of Mo's communist activities, Mo Xiong (Ëé´ÈõÑ) steadily excelled in Chiang Kai-shek's regime, eventually becoming an important member within Chiang Kai-shek's general headquarters in the early 1930s. In January 1934, Chiang Kai-shek named him as the administrator and commander-in-chief of the Fourth Special District in northern Jiangxi. Mo used his position to plant more than a dozen communist agents within Chiang's general headquarters, including Liu Yafo (Âäâ‰∫û‰Ωõ),the communist who first introduced to the Communist Party of China, Xiang Yunian (È†ÖËàáÂπ¥) his communist handler, whom he hired as his secretary, and Lu Zhiying (ÁõßÂøóËã±), the communist agent who was the acting head of the spy ring, which was directly under the command of Zhou Enlai. After successfully besieging the adjacent regions of Ruijin, the capital of the Jiangxi Soviet, and occupying most of Jiangxi Soviet itself, Chiang was confident that he would finish off the communists in a final decisive strike. In late September 1934, Chiang distributed his top secret plan named \\"Iron Bucket Plan\\" to everyone in his general headquarter at Lushan (the alternative summer site to Nanchang), which detailed the final push to totally annihilate the communist forces. The plan was to build 30 blockade lines supported by 30 barbed wire fences, most of them electric, in the region 150 km around Ruijin, to starve the communists. In addition, more than 1,000 trucks were to be mobilized to form a rapid reaction force in order to prevent any communist breakout. Realizing the certain annihilation of the communists, Mo Xiong (Ëé´ÈõÑ) handed the document weighing several kilograms to his communist handler Xiang Yunian (È†ÖËàáÂπ¥) the same night he received it, risking not only his own life, but that of his entire family. With the help of Liu Yafo (Âäâ‰∫û‰Ωõ) and Lu Zhiying (ÁõßÂøóËã±), the communist agents copied the important intelligence onto four dictionaries and Xiang Yunian (È†ÖËàáÂπ¥) was tasked to take the intelligence personally to the Jiangxi Soviet. The trip was hazardous, as the nationalist force would arrest and even execute anyone who attempted to cross the blockade. Xiang Yunian (È†ÖËàáÂπ¥) was forced to hide in the mountains for a while, and then used rocks to knock out 4 of his own teeth, resulting in swollen face. Disguised as a beggar, he tore off the covers of the four dictionaries and hid them at the bottom of his bag with rotten food, then successfully crossed several lines of the blockade and reached Ruijin on October 7, 1934. The valuable intelligence provided by Mo Xiong (Ëé´ÈõÑ) finally convinced the communists in Jiangxi Soviet to abandon its base and started a general retreat before Chiang could complete the building of his blockade lines with supporting barbed wire fences, and mobilizing trucks and troops, thus saving themselves from total annihilation. =The main retreating force in the Long March= Map of the CPC Soviets and the route of the Long March The portion of the First Front Red Army engaged in the so-called mobile warfare was actually the bulk of the communist force making a general retreat, but this force was only much diminished from its peak of more than 140,000 men army. With most of its equipment lost, many of the surviving members of the Chinese Red Army were forced to arm themselves with ancient weaponry. According to the Statistical Chart of the Field Army Personnel, Weaponry, Ammunition, and Supply completed by the Chinese Red Army on October 8, 1934, two days before the Long March begun, the Communist Long March force consisted of: Combat formations *5 combat corps totaling 72,313 combatants: **The 1st Corps (The largest of the five, with 19,880 combatants) **The 3rd Corps **The 5th Corps **The 8th Corps (the newest and smallest of the five, with 10,922 combatants) **The 9th Corps *2 columns **Central Committee 1st Column **Central Committee 2nd Column *The 5 corps and the 2 columns had a total of 86,859 combatants. Weaponry The Statistical Chart of Field Army Personnel, Weaponry, Ammunition, and Supply (currently kept at the People's Liberation Army Archives) also provided the weaponry and provisions prepared for the Long March, and the weapons deployed included: *Artillery: 39 total **Mortar: 38 **Mountain gun: 1 (originally not included, but was added later on) *Breech-loading firearms: 33,244 total (with 1,858,156 rounds of munition), and of these, a total of 29,016 were distributed to the 5 corps, including: **Rifles: 25,317 **Heavy machine guns: 333 **Light machine guns: 285 **Submachine guns: 28 **Handguns: 2,804 *Other weapons included: **Lance: 6,101 **Chinese saber: 882 *Various weapons were also deployed but their numbers were not counted, and these included: *Muzzle-loading rifled muskets and smoothbore muskets **Flintlock and snaphance guns **Matchlock and wheellock guns **Spears and rakes (though later during the Long March, spears were most useful as canes) **Axes and poles (though later during the Long March, poles were most useful as building material such as that for stretchers) **daggers and knives * Provision ** Winter clothing: 83,100 sets ** Horses: 338 ** Herbal medicine: 35,700 kg ** Salt: 17,413 kg ** Money: 1.642 million dollars of the Soviet Republic.

He signed with the Reds as a non-drafted amateur free agent in 2007. Despite starting his baseball career in his teenage years, and in Germany, Lutz first visited Cincinnati's spring training camp, reached Class AA and was placed on the Reds 40-man roster in 2012. Lutz was the first German-developed player to play in the modern Major Leagues. He played for Team Germany in the 2019 European Baseball Championship, in which they came in 6th. Career Lutz was still a baby when his family moved to Germany. He had his first experience with the sport at 14, when his older brother took him to a training session of the Friedberg Braves, a team located in Friedberg (Hessen). Since then, Lutz has rapidly increased his skills, especially his powerful hitting that made him so successful. After two years with the local team, he went to the Bad Homburg Hornets and played there for two seasons before he went to a baseball boarding school in Regensburg for one more season. =Cincinnati Reds= Within another few years, he became a member of the Germany national baseball team and traveled to Europe-wide training camps, which finally led to his signing with the Cincinnati Reds on July 15, 2007. Lutz played his first two seasons for the former Gulf Coast League affiliate of the Reds. In these he played 50 games and achieved a .250 BA with one home run and 19 RBIs in the first season, while only scoring a .169 BA, 10 RBIs and no home runs in the following year. In his third season Lutz remained in the Rookie level but was transferred to the Billings Mustangs from the Pioneer League, where he had a .286 BA as well as 7 home runs and 28 RBIs. After an impressive 2011 season for the single-A Dayton Dragons with a .301 BA and 20 home runs and the team's first cycle, Lutz was promoted to the Reds 40-man roster in 2012 and participated in 15 Spring training games. Only a few days before opening day he was dropped out of the active roster and sent to advanced-A affiliate Bakersfield Blaze. There he played a not less impressive season than the one before. Until mid-July he made 63 appearances and batted massive 17 home runs and 51 RBIs. After being promoted to double-A Pensacola Blue Wahoos Lutz continued with nearly the same statistics. Although playing in the Arizona Fall League and a second spring training with the Reds, Lutz started the 2013 season in Pensacola but remained on the 40-man roster. The Reds promoted Lutz to the Major Leagues on April 29, 2013. On May 5, 2013, against Shawn Camp of the Chicago Cubs, Lutz got his first MLB hit when he lined a ball into center field. Lutz also went on to score that inning, and registered an RBI and stolen base later in the same game. Lutz hit his first career home run on May 12, 2013, a three-run homer off of Brewers pitcher Wily Peralta. He was sent back down to Pensacola on June 25, 2013. On April 21, 2014, he hit for the first cycle in Blue Wahoos franchise history in a 17-1 win against the Jacksonville Suns. On May 1, 2015 it was announced that Lutz would undergo Tommy John surgery and would be out for the season. He was released on June 3, 2015. =Bravos De Leon= On March 30, 2017, Lutz signed with the Bravos de Le√≥n of the Mexican Baseball League. He was released on April 12, 2017. =Kansas City T-Bones= On May 4, 2017, Lutz signed with the Kansas City T-Bones of the American Association. He was released on May 17, 2017. =Brisbane Bandits= Lutz commenced his comeback from injury with the Brisbane Bandits in the ABL for the 2015-16 season, where his 3/7 in the 2016 Australian Baseball League postseason led to him being named Championship Series MVP and helping the Bandits to their first league championship. The following season, he played in a more limited capacity trying to break back into affiliated baseball from injuries, but still hit .323/.405/.600 across 19 games through the middle of the 2016-17 season. Lutz rejoined the Bandits full-time for the 2017-18 Australian Baseball League season where he broke the single season homerun record with teammate T. J. Bennett with 16. The Bandits went on to win their third consecutive ABL title. Following the conclusion of the 2017-18 season, he announced his retirement as a player, and later signed on as the new hitting coach of the Arizona League Reds for the 2018 season. On September 6, 2018, Lutz came out of retirement to play again for Brisbane in the 2018-19 Australian Baseball League season. He had a relatively lean season, slashing .186/.312/.310, but was key in Brisbane's postseason run, going 4/10 with three homeruns to help the Bandits to their fourth successive championship.

Using lap steel guitar instead of the traditional two electric guitar line-up, Grandfather Child has created a sound that mixes country, Gospel, as well as rhythm and blues.  History  Grandfather Child was founded in 2009 by Lucas Gorham as he left the punk rock group Satin Hooks. He formed the band originally as a trio, with Ryan Chavez, drums, and Mark Speer, bass with the goal to explore the music he had discovered in a film about Gospel music, called Sacred Steel. Speer left the group after several months and Gorham contacted Robert Ellis and Geoffrey Muller to split the bass role and add a guitar.

It is used in high- temperature geochemistry to simulate reactions occurring deep in the Earth's interior, in magma, for instance, or to model low-temperature reactions in aqueous solutions near the Earth's surface, the subject of this article.  Applications to aqueous systems  Geochemical modeling is used in a variety of fields, including environmental protection and remediation,Zhu, C. and G. Anderson, 2002, Environmental Applications of Geochemical Modeling. Cambridge University Press, 300 pp. the petroleum industry, and economic geology.Bethke, C.M., 2008, Geochemical and Biogeochemical Reaction Modeling. Cambridge University Press, 547 pp. Models can be constructed, for example, to understand the composition of natural waters; the mobility and breakdown of contaminants in flowing groundwater or surface water; the formation and dissolution of rocks and minerals in geologic formations in response to injection of industrial wastes, steam, or carbon dioxide; and the generation of acidic waters and leaching of metals from mine wastes.  Development of geochemical modeling  Garrels and Thompson (1962) first applied chemical modeling to geochemistry in 25 ¬∞C and one atmosphere total pressure. Their calculation, computed by hand, is now known as an equilibrium model, which predicts species distributions, mineral saturation states, and gas fugacities from measurements of bulk solution composition. By removing small aliquots of solvent water from an equilibrated spring water and repeatedly recalculating the species distribution, Garrels and Mackenzie (1967) simulated the reactions that occur as spring water evaporated.Garrels, R.M. and F.T. Mackenzie, 1967, Origin of the chemical compositions of some springs and lakes. Equilibrium Concepts in Natural Waters, Advances in Chemistry Series 67, American Chemical Society, Washington, DC, pp. 222-242 This coupling of mass transfer with an equilibrium model, known as a reaction path model, enabled geochemists to simulate reaction processes. Helgeson (1968) introduced the first computer program to solve equilibrium and reaction path models,Helgeson, H.C., 1968, Evaluation of irreversible reactions in geochemical processes involving minerals and aqueous solutions, I. Thermodynamic relations. Geochemica et Cosmochimica Acta 32, 853-877 which he and coworkers used to model geological processes like weathering, sediment diagenesis, evaporation, hydrothermal alteration, and ore deposition.Helgeson, H.C., R.M. Garrels and F.T. Mackenzie, 1969, Evaluation of irreversible reactions in geochemical processes involving minerals and aqueous solutions, II. Applications. Geochemica et Cosmochimica Acta 33, 455-481 Later developments in geochemical modeling included reformulating the governing equations, first as ordinary differential equations, then later as algebraic equations. Additionally, chemical components came to be represented in models by aqueous species, minerals, and gases, rather than by the elements and electrons which make up the species, simplifying the governing equations and their numerical solution. Recent improvements in the power of personal computers and modeling software have made geochemical models more accessible and more flexible in their implementation.Zhu, C., 2009, Geochemical Modeling of Reaction Paths and Geochemical Reaction Networks. In E.H. Oelkers and J. Schott(eds.), 2009, Thermodynamics and Kinetics of Water-Rock Interaction. Reviews in Mineralogy and Geochemistry 70, 533-569 Geochemists are now able to construct on their laptops complex reaction path or reactive transport models which previously would have required a supercomputer.Brady, P.V. and C.M. Bethke, 2000, Beyond the Kd approach. Ground Water 38, 321-322  Setting up a geochemical model  An aqueous system is uniquely defined by its chemical composition, temperature, and pressure.Anderson, G.M. 2009, Thermodynamics of Natural Systems. Cambridge University Press, 664 pp. Creating geochemical models of such systems begins by choosing the basis, the set of aqueous species, minerals, and gases which are used to write chemical reactions and express composition. The number of basis entries required equals the number of components in the system, which is fixed by the phase rule of thermodynamics. Typically, the basis is composed of water, each mineral in equilibrium with the system, each gas at known fugacity, and important aqueous species. Once the basis is defined, a modeler can solve for the equilibrium state, which is described by mass action and mass balance equations for each component. In finding the equilibrium state, a geochemical modeler solves for the distribution of mass of all species, minerals, and gases which can be formed from the basis. This includes the activity, activity coefficient, and concentration of aqueous species, the saturation state of minerals, and the fugacity of gases. Minerals with a saturation index (log Q/K) equal to zero are said to be in equilibrium with the fluid. Those with positive saturation indices are termed supersaturated, indicating they are favored to precipitate from solution. A mineral is undersaturated if its saturation index is negative, indicating that it is favored to dissolve. Geochemical modelers commonly create reaction path models to understand how systems respond to changes in composition, temperature, or pressure. By configuring the manner in which mass and heat transfer are specified (i.e., open or closed systems), models can be used to represent a variety of geochemical processes. Reaction paths can assume chemical equilibrium, or they can incorporate kinetic rate laws to calculate the timing of reactions. In order to predict the distribution in space and time of the chemical reactions that occur along a flowpath, geochemical models are increasingly being coupled with hydrologic models of mass and heat transport to form reactive transport models. Specialized geochemical modeling programs that are designed as cross-linkable re-entrant software objects enable construction of reactive transport models of any flow configuration.  Types of reactions  Geochemical models are capable of simulating many different types of reactions. Included among them are: *Acid-base reactions *Aqueous complexation *Mineral dissolution and precipitation *Reduction and oxidation (redox) reactions, including those catalyzed by enzymes, surfaces, and microorganisms *Sorption, ion exchange, and surface complexation *Gas dissolution and exsolution *Stable isotope fractionation *Radioactive decay Simple phase diagrams or plots are commonly used to illustrate such geochemical reactions. Eh-pH (Pourbaix) diagrams, for example, are a special type of activity diagram which represent acid-base and redox chemistry graphically.  Uncertainties in geochemical modelling  Various sources can contribute to a range of simulation results. The range of the simulation results is defined as model uncertainty. One of the most important sources not possible to quantify is the conceptual model, which is developed and defined by the modeller. Further sources are the parameterization of the model regarding the hydraulic (only when simulating transport) and mineralogical properties. The parameters used for the geochemical simulations can also contribute to model uncertainty. These are the applied thermodynamic database and the parameters for the kinetic minerals dissolution. Differences in the thermodynamic data (i.e. equilibrium constants, parameters for temperature correction, activity equations and coefficients) can result in large uncertainties. Furthermore, the large spans of experimentally derived rate constants for minerals dissolution rate laws can cause large variations in simulation results. Despite this is well-known, uncertainties are not frequently considered when conducting geochemical modelling. Reducing uncertainties can be achieved by comparison of simulation results with experimental data, although experimental data does not exist at every temperature-pressure condition and for every chemical system. Although such a comparison or calibration can not be conducted consequently the geochemical codes and thermodynamic databases are state-of-the-art and the most useful tools for predicting geochemical processes.

Background The Santisima Trinidad was a large ship constructed in 1750 at Manila of 60 guns and at the time the largest Manila galleon ever built. It was built for trade in the Pacific between the Spanish colonies. On 3 September 1762 the Trinidad departed the port of Cavite in the Spanish Philippines for Acapulco in Spanish Mexico with a cargo of valuables. However, due to contrary winds she never left the San Bernardino Strait until late September. On the night of 2‚Äì3 October a storm, possibly the tail end of a typhoon, brought down the fore and mainmasts and it was decided to turn back to Cavite under a jury rig. Unbeknown to the ships company Spain and Great Britain were at war as Spain had joined on the side of the French. As a result, a British and East Indian Company task force from India had thus captured Manila just as the Trinidad had left port.Paine p 160 Battle As Trinidad passed through the San Bernardino Strait, HMS Panther and HMS Argo soon discovered her, and caught up with the Spanish ship. An action followed with Argo and Panther concentrating their fire on the masts and rigging. To Parker's amazement, the shots from Panther made very little impression on the galleon's hardwood. However, Trinidad was soon disabled and unable to manoeuvre was left a dismasted wreck. Despite this, Trinidad managed to put up stout resistance and continued for a total of 2 hours but the ship was overcrowded for its size of nearly 800 crew, marines, civilians and its large cargo. It had in fact less than half the guns required to fight. Soon the Spanish commander realised that any further resistance was futile and surrendered soon after. The cost for the Spanish was 18 killed and 10 wounded and 750 captured while British casualties were 35 killed and 37 wounded. Aftermath The cargo was valued at $1.5 million and the ship at $3 million. The galleon was eventually broken up for scrap.

Erected after the deportations of the Jews in Hungary as part of the Nazi extermination through labour plan, about 1,700 female inmates were assigned to work on the first paved runway of the nearby Rhein-Main Airport. History A Reichsarbeitsdienst hut camp in the forest north of Walldorf already existed at the site during the construction of the Reichsautobahn section from Frankfurt to Darmstadt (the present-day Bundesautobahn 5) opened in 1935. From 1943 it was used as a forced labour camp of the Rodgau-Dieburg prison. Former cellar of kitchen barrack Upon the invasion of Wehrmacht troops into Hungary (Operation Margarethe) and the accession of D√∂me Szt√≥jay as Prime Minister in March 1944, the deportations of the Hungarian Jews to Auschwitz supervised by Adolf Eichmann began on April 27. The Hungarian Jewish women arriving in Walldorf came directly from Auschwitz-Birkenau, where they had narrowly escaped the selection of Dr. Josef Mengele and the gas chambers. The arrested 1700 young girls and women aged 14 to 45 years were requested by the Organisation Todt under chief engineer Franz Xaver Dorsch at the SS- Reichssicherheitshauptamt and had to perform forced labor at the construction site of the Z√ºblin company at Frankfurt Airport. About 50 women didn't survive this four-month time period of hard work, insufficient rations and physical abuse. Most of the remaining women were no longer able to work when the camp was closed after the liberation of Natzweiler-Struthof in November 1944. Only about 300 survived the further deportations to the Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp and the holocaust. Former cellar of kitchen barrack After World War II, the runway construction was completed under the US occupation forces and is in use up to today. The former camp, forgotten or repressed, was blown up and the area reforested again. In the 1970s, the camp was rediscovered and a first memorial stone was inaugurated in 1980. From the year 1996 on, there was a continuous and lively analysis of the history of the outpost camp. In the year 2000, attended by 19 survivors, a memorial path was opened in the forest: On several plates the history of the camp and the women imprisoned are described with their individual fates. In addition, a brick-built cellar under the former kitchen barrack was excavated, in which prisoners were beaten to death. The Margit-Horv√°th-Foundation was founded in 2004. Margaret Horv√°th was one of the survivors of this camp. Her son gave his mothers so-called compensation money to the foundation, which now forms the symbolic core of the Foundation.

According to traditional biographies, he became a monk when he was 25 at Yanshou Temple, although he later left to study at Mount Nan before finally taking on Dongshan Liangjie as his teacher on Mount Dong. After receiving dharma transmission from Dongshan, he went to a place called Three Peak Hermitage, and finally to Mount Yunju, northeast of modern Nanchang in Jiangxi Province. Here he established Jenru Temple, where he taught for 30 years and eventually attracted 1,500 students. Amongst modern Caodong/S≈çt≈ç practitioners, Tongan Daopi is commonly regarded as Yunju's successor through whom the Caodong teaching descended. This view comes from Huihong's Sengbao zhuan, which was completed in 1119, long after Yunju's life. Contemporary information, however, disagrees with this version of history. The Zutang ji (Patriarch's Hall Record), which was completed in 952, covers the life of Yunju Daoying, but does not mention Tongan Daopi as his disciple. The Zutang ji does, however, record someone with the name Tongan asking a question to Yunju Daoying. The scholar Ui Hakuju has written this could likely refer to Tongan Daopi. However, in the Transmission of the Lamp, which was compiled around 1004, Tongan Daopi is mentioned as a student of Yunju. The Transmission of the Lamp also claims that Tongan had no students himself. In other words, the Caodong school did not descend through Yunju as is commonly thought, but rather through another student of Dongshan Liangjie, namely Jufeng Puman. The scholar Morten Schl√ºtter suggests that the lineage according to the Transmission of the Lamp is more likely correct because Dayang Jingshuan, who in Huihong's version of the lineage is a descendant of Yunju, is recorded in the Transmission of the Lamp as being descended through Jufeng Puman. Dayang was close with Wang Shu, one of the compilers of Transmission of the Lamp, suggesting that it is unlikely that an error would have been made therein about his own lineage.

History Rossetti's real name was Charles Gabriel Dante Rossetti, but his admiration for the great Florentine poet led him to change it to Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and he proceeded to sign all his work so. In the specific, the very subject of this painting is taken from Dante Aligheri's Inferno, Canto V ‚Äì it is a small watercolour triptych executed in the archaic, medievalising style of this period in Rossetti's art, and was never painted in oil. Although the artist had been sketching the subject for many years, the watercolour took him just one week to complete. The buyer was the writer and critic John Ruskin.The subject was commissioned by Ellen Heaton, but John Ruskin, who had requested five watercolours from Rossetti, bought it for 35 guineas and offered it, along with another picture, to Miss Heaton. He described the picture to her in a letter as 'a most gloomy drawing ‚Äì very grand ‚Äì but dreadful ‚Äì of Dante seeing the soul of Francesca and her lover!' Not surprisingly, Heaton was dissuaded from buying the picture, which Ruskin kept for himself. Cf. V. Surtees, The Paintings & Drawings of Dante Gabriel Rossetti (1828‚Äì1882): A Catalogue Raisonn√©, vol.1, Oxford 1971, p.37. See also the Tate's ref. The drawing is simple and the colours generally muted. Only Francesca's long golden hair looks forward to the more sensuous creatures of Rossetti's later works. The picture was originally planned as a triptych in oil, with the same scenes as in the watercolour, but with the lovers kissing as the central motif. =The Triptych and the inspiring Canto= Francesca was the sister-in- law of Paolo Malatesta, and both were married, but they fell in love. Their tragic adulterous story was told by Dante in his Divine Comedy, Canto V of the Inferno, and was a popular subject with Victorian artists and sculptors, especially with followers of the Pre-Raphaelite ideology, and with other writers. The triptych has several inscriptions taken from Canto V, with Rossetti bringing the story to life by writing relevant quotations in the original Italian around the edge of the composition.The top of central panel has the inscription O lasso! (\\"Alas!\\"). At bottom left, another continues the same verse, quanti dolci pensier, quanto disio... (\\"how many sweet thoughts, how great desire\\"), Inferno, Canto V, vv.112‚Äì113. Its three parts read from left to right. The left-hand panel shows the adulterous kiss that condemns the lovers: staying faithful to Dante's poem, Rossetti depicts them reading about the Arthurian knight Sir Lancelot who also suffered for his forbidden love (his figure can be seen on the book's open page, dressed, like Paolo, in red and blue). The scene illustrates the following lines from Dante's text: The central panel depicts two of Rossetti's literary heroes crowned with laurel: the Roman poet Virgil and the much-revered Dante himself ‚Äì they regard with concern the two lovers on the right, who appear to float like wraiths in each other's arms, amid the flames of hell. Their adulterous relationship uncovered, they were murdered by Francesca's husband and Paolo's brother, Giovanni Malatesta, and banished to the second circle of hell. In the final panel of the triptych, the lovers are being blown about violently with the wind, as described by Dante's verses: See also * List of paintings by Dante Gabriel Rossetti * The Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri * Rossetti and His Circle by Max Beerbohm References Further reading * Ash, Russell.

General Yi Seong-gye had gained power and respect during the late 1370s and early 1380s by pushing Mongol remnants off the Korean Peninsula and also by repelling well-organized Japanese pirates in a series of successful engagements. He was also credited with routing the Red Turbans when they made their move into the Korean Peninsula as part of their rebellion against the Yuan dynasty. Following in the wake of the rise of the Ming Dynasty under Zhu Yuanzhang, the royal court in Goryeo split into two competing factions: the group led by General Yi (supporting the Ming Dynasty) and the camp led by his rival General Choe (supporting the Yuan Dynasty). When a Ming messenger came to Goryeo in 1388 (the 14th year of King U) to demand the return of a significant portion of Goryeo's northern territory, General Choe Yeong seized the opportunity and played upon the prevailing anti-Ming atmosphere to argue for the invasion of the Liaodong Peninsula (Goryeo claimed to be the successor of the ancient kingdom of Goguryeo; as such, restoring Manchuria as part of Korean territory was a tenet of its foreign policy throughout its history). King U ordered General Yi to invade Liaodong Peninsula and attack the new Ming dynasty army in support of the Mongols, despite the General's protest. in 1388 Yi arrived at Wihwa Island ( = Weihua Island) on the Amrok River, also known as the Yalu River, and realized that the Ming forces outnumbered his own. Instead of invading he made a momentous decision, commonly called \\"Turning back the army from Wihwa Island\\", that would alter the course of Korean history. Knowing of the support he enjoyed both from high-ranking government officials, the general populace, and the great deterrent of Ming Empire under the Hongwu Emperor, Yi decided to revolt and swept back to the capital, Gaegyeong, to trigger a coup d'√©tat and secure control of the government. This was the first of a series of Yi's rebellious actions that eventually led to the establishment of the Joseon dynasty. After being formed in July 1392, Yi's dynasty lasted until October 1897, when it was replaced by the Korean Empire.

Salumets is also a former Estonian Reform Party politician who was a member of the Riigikogu (Estonian parliament) from 2007 to 2011.  Early life and career  Jaak Salumets was born in Paide and started his basketball career in his hometown. Soon he was discovered by basketball coaches in TPI (present day TT√ú) and made his way through to the Soviet youth team and Tallinn Kalev. In 1968 he won the European Junior Championships with the national team, scoring 33 points in the final against Yugoslavia and deserved the attention of senior team coaches. Two years later he was invited to the senior team by Alexander Gomelsky, but then 19-year-old Jaak refused, explaining the decision as \\"I was too young and wanted to concentrate on studies\\". Gomelsky understood this as a personal insult and Salumets did not receive any opportunities to play under Gomelsky's led Soviet Union national basketball team anymore. In 1970, Estonian SSR managed to take a historical win over Team USA. Jaak Salumets scored 25 points against latter NBA star Julius Erving.

He was in the shortlist for the 1972 Olympic team, but was replaced with Gennadi Volnov. Salumets finally won his first and last prize, bronze medal in EuroBasket 1973. After the only major tournament he got in conflict with the new head coach as well and was ruled out of the national team permanently.  Final years and coaching  Jaak Salumets did not win anything spectacular, besides playing in the top flight of the Soviet basketball. In 1979 Salumets concluded his career as a player and took a break from professional basketball. 6 years later, in 1985 he became the head coach of Tallinn Kalev, his former team, which struggled to show decent results in both Soviet and Estonian SSR championships. With the new coach Kalev improved his game and won surprisingly the last Soviet basketball championships held, in 1991. The team consisted of players like Olympic champion Tiit Sokk, latter Panathinaikos B.C. shooter Aivar Kuusmaa, Gert Kullam√§e, and George Jackson, the first and also last American player in the Soviet Union basketball league. Shortly after the great triumph he was offered to become the mentor of Soviet Union national basketball team and BC Avtodor Saratov.Arike, Ville. \\"Jaak Salumets:'Ma armastan ennast liiga palju, et uuesti treeneriks hakata'\\". √ïhtuleht. 12 November 2007.

After successful summer with the national team he was contracted by Lithuanian giant BC ≈Ωalgiris and achieved first place for newly recognized Lithuanian Basketball League. However, it was a one year spell with the 'Grunwald' and Salumets moved back to Estonia to his last stint with Tallinn Kalev.

It was released on November 24, 2013, by Funk Volume and distributed by EMPIRE. Hopsin has said that the overall vibe of the album is different from his previous album Raw and that he has said all he needs to about leaving Ruthless Records. The album contains guest appearances from rappers SwizZz, Dizzy Wright, Jarren Benton, and Tech N9ne, among others. Like its predecessors, the album's production was entirely handled by Hopsin himself. Knock Madness was supported by three singles, \\"Old Friend\\", \\"Hop Is Back\\", and \\"Rip Your Heart Out\\", the last of which features Tech N9ne. Hopsin also supported the album with the Fuck It Tour with Yelawolf, and the Knock Madness Tour. Knock Madness was met with generally positive reviews from music critics. The album also peaked at number 76 on the US Billboard 200 and, as of December 2013, has sold 16,000 copies according to Nielsen SoundScan. Background Hopsin spoke about the album in an interview with HipHopDX on August 12, 2011, where he said that he was aiming to make the production quality of Knock Madness sound just as good, if not better, than his perception of Dr. Dre's upcoming album, Detox. He also stated that the album would have a \\"positive message\\" and that when people listen to the album he wants them to feel \\"inspired to be better in life\\". On January 20, 2012, he stated via his Twitter account that Knock Madness was his main priority in life. He later spoke on the background of the album's sound, saying, > I'm 28 years old, and I see that I'm kind of in this weird position. I don't > have many friends in my personal life, but I have so many fans. So when I go > outside and people recognize me, it's kind of a bittersweet feeling, like I > don't recognize the fans. I don't really have it like they probably think I > have it. I'm really still a loser guy, but I'm just really popular now. I > don't have a girlfriend no more, and I have this money, but I'm not > satisfied with my life. It's this weird feeling of being incomplete, and I > need to find myself. So that's kind of what it did to me, and the album just > came out with me just fucking rapping some dark shit. Recording and production Following the RAW Tour in mid-2011, Hopsin begun working on Knock Madness, though not very heavily. On January 17, 2012, fellow Funk Volume rappers SwizZz and Dizzy Wright were confirmed to make appearances on the album. In a March 2012 interview, Hopsin said that he talked to Tech N9ne about appearing on the album, which Tech N9ne agreed to. He also stated in 2012 that he wanted Yelawolf on the album. In September 2012, Hopsin confirmed that he would self-produce the majority of the album, with drummer Travis Barker producing one or two tracks. Later that month, Hopsin would indicate interest in working with Childish Gambino. In addition, Hopsin approached Macklemore in January 2013 to get him featured in the album. In February 2013, Hopsin stated in an interview that he was currently recording the album, having recorded 18 songs, and that he hoped to have the album completed by June. Hopsin begun heavily recording Knock Madness in March 2013 following the end of a long-term relationship, which gave him more time to record and focus on his music. He also indicated the album would be released with a bonus CD that will have all the 'Ill Mind of Hopsin' songs remastered, however this ultimately did not take place. In October 2013, Hopsin confirmed that he had finished recording the album and had turned it in to Funk Volume, stating he had personally re-mastered the album 20-30 times to get the sound just right. Music and lyrics Hopsin detailed the album to The Source saying, > There's a variety of music on there. There's crazy, wild lyrics. There's > sad, emotional lyrics and even funny lyrics. I got serious songs and sad > songs. Just a big variety of everything. I wanted to show the full me. I > have a lot of people who love me, but I have a lot of haters as well. There > are at least one or two songs for someone that doesn't really like me or > what I put out. I think they'll stumble across a couple songs that will make > them go, oh ok, I fucks with him now. I kinda wanted to make an album to > show my wide range of music that I can do. I just wanted to show the full > me. In the lead single \\"Hop Is Back\\", Hopsin pokes fun at Kendrick Lamar and disses Kanye West's newer music. Hopsin clarified his statements in an interview with HipHopDX saying he had no ill feelings towards Kendrick Lamar, and that he dissed West because he disliked his new music. \\"Tears to Snow\\" is an emotional song about him and his ex-girlfriend having relationship issues and breaking up. In the song he explains how she would assume he would cheat on her. The second verse is also partly about how Hopsin's former colleagues have changed and turned against him. For \\"Rip Your Heart Out\\" featuring Tech N9ne, Hopsin created what he called a \\"weird, funky, dope beat that you can just bop your head to.\\" Hopsin spoke on \\"Hip Hop Sinister\\" saying, \\"That's probably the most intense rap song on the album. It's not a song that's going to slowly change anybody's life. It's just a rap song just have bars and sound dope. The energy on that, you'll probably hear it and want to cut somebody's throat. The song just amps you up so much. It's so hyped to where you want to punch a hole in somebody's head or punch a hole through the wall.\\" \\"Good Guys Get Left Behind\\" is a love song, that features multiple twists and turns. \\"Old Friend\\" is based around a friend of his that became addicted to methamphetamine and the personal issues which he suffered from it. Hopsin has said the meaning of the song was \\"to show what early wrong decisions can do to youngsters in the long run\\", as well as \\"what they can possibly miss out on.\\" \\"Lunch Time Cypher\\" was meant to give the feeling of a high school cypher, complete with beatboxing, random, crazy lyrics from Hopsin, and featured artists Passionate MC and G-Mo Skee. The song \\"What's My Purpose\\" is, according to Hopsin, \\"about a human born into this current dark society. How everybody is doing the same thing. Nobody is really different. And the government has us here to just make money.\\" He also touches on his race- related arrest after a concert in Orlando, Florida. The album's outro \\"Caught In the Rain\\" discusses about how Hopsin is soul-searching and needing to find himself. Release and promotion Hopsin performing on tour in promotion of Knock Madness. In July 2012, Hopsin released the fifth installment of his \\"Ill Mind of Hopsin\\" video series. It received over one million views in less than 24 hours and currently has over 104 million views. In \\"Ill Mind of Hopsin 5\\", Hopsin expresses his frustration with jaded youth and disenchantment towards other rappers who are unrelatable. The song itself charted at number 17 on Billboards Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Digital songs chart. In December 2012, Hopsin hinted on his Facebook and Twitter pages that him and Travis Barker were working on a project together, though further details were withheld at the time. Then, in late December, Travis Barker revealed that a collaboration EP would be released in 2013. Then, on February 5, 2013, Hopsin announced that production for the EP had been finished. In February 2013, Hopsin said the album would be released around September 2013. The album cover for Knock Madness, as well as the album's release date of November 26, 2013, was revealed at the end of the music video for \\"Ill Mind Six: Old Friend\\". The cover artwork depicts Marcus Hopson burying his rap alter ego Hopsin. On September 11, 2013, Hopsin debuted a new vlog series about the making of the album. The series focused on how he got inspired, came up with lyrics, and mixed the songs for Knock Madness. On November 7, 2013, Hopsin released the album's track listing. =Touring= Hopsin, with the rest of the Funk Volume artists, went on a two-month worldwide tour in late 2012, which included 58 shows in 60 days throughout the United States, Europe and Australia. From November 14 to November 23, 2013, Hopsin toured with Shady Records artist Yelawolf in promotion of Knock Madness on The Fuck It Tour. They toured the West Coast of the United States and Hopsin performed material from the album for the first time. The Knock Madness World Tour began on December 12, 2013 in Australia. On January 18, 2014, the tour moved to North America, starting in Santa Cruz, California. The leg of the tour ran through March 22, 2014. Dizzy Wright and DJ Hoppa joined Hopsin on select dates during the North American run of the tour. Singles Rapper Tech N9ne makes an appearance on the third single \\"Rip Your Heart Out\\". In an interview with ThisIs50, Hopsin released information on the album, stating that the first single would be named \\"Hop Madness\\". Hopsin confirmed via his Facebook and Twitter on January 5, 2012 that he would be shooting the \\"Hop Madness\\" video that month. On February 16, 2012, Hopsin stated that the music video would be released within the next month. The video was officially released on March 15, 2012. The song was ultimately excluded from the album. On July 17, 2013, Hopsin released the music video for \\"Old Friend\\" on both his YouTube channel, and the single to iTunes. He later confirmed that the song is not the sixth in the \\"Ill Mind of Hopsin\\" series but rather the first single from Knock Madness. On August 18, 2013, Hopsin confirmed in a Facebook status that the lead single from Knock Madness, titled \\"Hop Is Back\\", would be released in a couple of weeks. However, the single's release, with its accompanying music video, was delayed until October 22, 2013. \\"Rip Your Heart Out\\", featuring Tech N9ne, was released as the album's third single on November 12, 2013. The same day, Hopsin and Tech N9ne filmed the music video for \\"Rip Your Heart Out\\". The music video for \\"I Need Help\\" was released on April 6, 2014. Critical reception Knock Madness received generally positive reviews from music critics. On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 77, based on 5 reviews, which indicates \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Omar Burgess of HipHopDX classified the album as \\"Pop-tinged Horrorcore of the highest order\\", praising its \\"catchy hooks, accessible production and subject matter\\" as well as \\"Hopsin's raw technical ability\\" with regards to lyricism and wordplay. In the end Burgess said, \\"When he [Hopsin] strikes the perfect balance between shock value, raw emotion and his immense skill set, that moment may yield a classic album.\\" Sheldon Pierce of XXL called Knock Madness \\"a stepping stone album, one that can only produce even better music in the future\\", and noted that the album did well to \\"serve as a peek into the wildly entertaining thought process of one of hip-hop's most misunderstood characters.\\" Jordan Sowunmi of Exclaim! stated that the album excels when Hopsin \\"focuses on external obsessions: ode to amateur skating 'Nollie Tre Flip' has the most enticingly offbeat rapping on the album, as well as a dizzying internal rhyme scheme, while 'Turn on the Lights' analogue 'Dream Forever' is heartfelt and raw.\\" David Jeffries of AllMusic praised the album's consistency for providing \\"shocking lyrics and infectious hooks\\", highlighting 'Rip Your Heart Out' featuring Tech N9ne as a standout track. Dominick Grillo of DJBooth noted that Hopsin's \\"technical passionate wordplays offer constant comparisons to Eminem\\", concluding that the album is \\"a dark, often violent creative response to the pressure now resting on Hopsin's shoulders\\", conceding that there are moments when Hopsin \\"weighs himself (and the audience) down with layers upon layers of negativity\\", though admitting that the album \\"works best when Hopsin is either angrily fighting or humorously poking fun at some sort of ludicrosity.\\" Commercial performance After only being released for three days, Knock Madness debuted at number 132 on the US Billboard 200, selling 4,000 copies in the United States. In its first full week the album rose to number 76 on the Billboard 200, selling 12,000 more copies, bringing its total album sales to 16,000 according to Nielsen SoundScan. The album has sold 58,000 copies in the US as of April 2015. Track listing *All songs produced by Hopsin.

He has contributed to the methodologies of field archaeology and landscape survey, particularly geophysics and the use of computers when recording and processing archaeological data. He is the director of the Landscape Research Centre and visiting professor at the universities of York, Leeds, Huddersfield and Vienna.  Early life  Powlesland was born in Romford (Essex) and began participating in archaeological excavations aged 11 in Colchester and continued through his teenage years.  Career  Powlesland's archaeological work has focused on the Vale of Pickering in Yorkshire. He has been working on this landscape since 1977, not only recording the archaeology but pioneering investigation techniques and methods that have influenced the discipline internationally. These include several major excavation projects and landscape investigations using geophysics, aerial photography and field survey methods. In 1984 Powlesland consolidated his team into the Landscape Research Centre, a charitable trust \\"dedicated to undertaking and disseminating archaeological research at a landscape scale\\". = West Heslerton = The West Heslerton project focused on the excavation of over of Anglo-Saxon settlement and cemetery. It was one of the largest and most detailed archaeological investigations ever conducted, recording more than 300,000 artefacts in three dimensions and comprehensively recording occupations from prehistory to well after the Anglo-Saxon occupation. = Landscape archaeology = Powlesland has advocated a detailed, landscape-scale approach to archaeology, arguing that studying sites in isolation misses the 'connective tissue' of past landscapes. The Landscape Research Centre has carried out this approach; for example studying of Vale of Pickering with geophysics, topographic and aerial survey, and the use of soil sampling for sediments and finds. The Heslerton Parish Project studied around the village of West Heslerton in order to set the excavations in context. It included multi-spectral aerial photography and geophysical magnetometer survey. = Computing and archaeology = Powlesland was an early adopter of computers as part of the archaeological recording process - beginning by writing his own programs for a Wang 2200 in 1982. Digital methods for recording, processing, analysing and presenting the results of archaeological research were developed and tested by Powlesland and his team throughout various projects. His work has been lauded by others in the field, particularly for the detailed three- dimensional recording of artefacts. Honours On 1 February 2007, he was elected Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London (FSA). In 2009, he was elected an Honorary Member of the Aerial Archaeology Research Group. He was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of York in 2011 in recognition of his pioneering work in landscape archaeology and computer applications in archaeology. In 2019, he was awarded the Landscape Archaeology Medal by the British Academy.

The IPS does not represent indigenous peoples or their organizations, but assists those organizations in presenting their causes, and helps to disseminate information among them. IPS was established in 1994 under the auspices of the Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy (AEPS). It was around the same time that the category of Permanent Participants was being developed and applied to the three indigenous peoples‚Äô organizations then observers in the AEPS. When the Arctic Council was established in 1996, both the Permanent Participants and IPS was reinserted into the new intergovernmental framework. Since commencing business in 1994, the role of the secretariat has been to facilitate contributions from the Permanent Participants to the cooperation of the eight Arctic states and to assist the Permanent Participants in performing, mainly communicational task. The work of IPS The Arctic Council Indigenous Peoples‚Äô Secretariat is a support Secretariat for the International Indigenous Peoples‚Äô Organizations that have Permanent Participant status in the Arctic Council. IPS assists with creating opportunities for the Indigenous Peoples‚Äô Organizations to present their causes, and helps provide them with necessary information and materials. IPS work includes: ‚Ä¢ Ensuring that Permanent Participants are sent documents and reports connected to the work of the Arctic Council and its working groups. ‚Ä¢ Helping Permanent Participants to present their views to the Arctic Council and its Working Groups. ‚Ä¢ Collecting and communicating information about the Arctic Council and its results to the Indigenous Peoples in the various parts of the Arctic. ‚Ä¢ Providing co-ordination for the Indigenous Peoples‚Äô Organizations to meet with each other, and to participate in the Arctic Council Working Groups. Governing Board and staff A Governing Board, chosen from among the six indigenous peoples' groups that are permanent participants, directs the work of IPS and approves its annual work agenda. Permanent participants choose the Chair of the Governing Board, a position that rotates among the six indigenous groups. The current Chair, Ethel Blake, representing Gwich'in Council International, assumed the two-year post in 2017;New IPS Chair , IPS, 24 May 2011. Accessed January 27, 2012. the previous incumbent was Tommy Pedersen of the Saami Council, who had held the post since 2009. The working language for meetings of the IPS is English; official communications, however, are published in both English and Russian. The Executive Secretary, currently Elle Merete Omma, is responsible for daily operations and for directing IPS staff. Workplace rules and regulations, as well as accounting and auditing procedures, follow Danish law. The Indigenous Peoples organizations There are six indigenous peoples organizations covering the Arctic, they all have status of permanent participants in the Arctic Council =Aleut International Association - AIA= The Aleut International Association represents Aleut on the Russian and American Aleutian, Pribilof and Commander Islands. It is an Alaska Native not- for-profit corporation, 501(c)(3), registered in the State of Alaska, United States of America, in 1998. AIA was formed by the Aleutian/Pribilof Islands Association, U.S., one of the thirteen regional not-for-profit Alaska Native corporations created as a result of Alaska Native Settlement Claims Act in 1971, and the Association of the Indigenous Peoples of the North of the Aleut District of the Kamchatka Region of the Russian Federation (AIPNADKR). AIA is governed by a Board of Directors composed of four Alaskan and four Russian Aleuts under the leadership of a president. The current president is Mr. Michael Zacharof of Saint Paul Island, Alaska, U.S. The Executive Director is Victoria Gofman of Anchorage, Alaska, U.S.The organization was formed to address environmental and cultural concerns of the extended Aleut family whose wellbeing has been connected to the rich resources of the Bering Sea for millennia. Russian and American Aleuts are separated by distances, borders and the International Date Line but united by the great Bering Sea and the North Pacific. Today, not only does the Aleut community share the resources of the region but the environmental problems as well. The need to understand global processes, such as trans-boundary contaminants transport, the impacts of climate change, and the effects of commercial fisheries on the ecosystem of the Bering Sea to name a few, was an impetus in joining in the work of international fora where AIA is actively pursuing collaboration with governments, scientists, and other organizations in developing programs and policies that could improve the wellbeing of the Aleut people and their environment. AIA was admitted as a permanent participant of the Arctic Council in 1998 and was granted Special Consultive Status by the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations in 2004. In addition, AIA is an accredited Non Governmental Organization (NGO) with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Global Environment Facility (GEF). =Arctic Athabaskan Council - AAC= The Arctic Athabaskan Council is an international treaty organization established to represent the interests of United States and Canadian Athabaskan member First Nation governments in Arctic Council fora, and to foster a greater understanding of the common heritage of all Athabaskan peoples of Arctic North America. The founding members of AAC include four Alaskan Athabaskan communities (Chickaloon Village Traditional Council, Healy Lake Traditional Council (Mendas Cha~Ag), Steven Village Tribal Government Council, Northway Tribal Council) - and three Athabaskan representative bodies on the Canadian side - the Council of Yukon First Nations, representing eleven Yukon First Nations; the Dene Nation, representing 30 First Nations in the Northwest Territories and northern Manitoba; and M√©tis Nation-Northwest Territories, representing 13 communities in the Northwest Territories. In total, Arctic Athabaskan founding member governments represent approximately 32,000 indigenous peoples of Athabaskan descent residing in Arctic and Sub-Arctic North America. As more member governments from both the United States (Alaska) and Canada join, this number is expected to increase to approximately 40,000. =Gwich'in Council International - GCI= The Gwich'in Council International was established as a non-profit organization in 1999 by the Gwich'in Tribal Council in Inuvik, NWT, to ensure all regions of the Gwich'in Nation in the Northwest Territories, Yukon and Alaska are represented at the Arctic Council, as well as to play an active and significant role in the development of policies that relate to the Circumpolar Arctic. GCI has a number of priorities that relate to the environment, youth, culture and tradition, social and economic development and education. The founding members of GCI includes six Alaskan Gwich'in communities (Arctic Village, Chalkyitsik, Fort Yukon, Birtch, Circle and Venetie) two Gwich'in representative bodies in Canada - Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation representing Vuntut Gwitchin in Old Crow, Yukon, and Gwich'in Tribal Council representing four communities in the Beaufort Delta region in the Northwest Territories. In total, the Gwich'in Council International founding members represent approximately 9,000 indigenous peoples of Gwich'in descent. The GCI Secretariat rotates between the Gwich'in Tribal Council in Inuvik, NWT and the Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation in Old Crow, Yukon. =Inuit Circumpolar Council - ICC= The Inuit Circumpolar Council is a transnational non- governmental organization representing 150 000 Inuit across the Circumpolar North. The ICC began originally as an Inuit Circumpolar Conference, first held in 1977, and gradually evolved to become a Council in the 10th General Assembly meeting of the Inuit Circumpolar Conference in 2006 in Utqiagvik, Alaska. The ICC represents today four different Inuit regional organizations in Canada, Alaska, Greenland and Russia. The Russian regional Council in Chukotka was opened 2001 and it operates closely with the Yupik Society, which represents Chukotka's Inuit locally and nationally. The ICC Alaska consists of Inuit from the North Slope Borough, Northwest Arctic Borough, the Bering Straits Region, and the Yukon-Kuskokwim Region and the ICC Canada represents the four land-claim regions, namely Inuvialuit, Labrador, Nunavik, and Nunavut. The ICC Greenland differs from the other regional Councils, representing different organisms of the Greenlandic society instead of representing specific area within the country. Members in the Greenlandic ICC are thus NGOs like the women's association, political entities such as Greenland's parliament and political parties and special-interest groups, e.g. Greenland's workers union (SIK). The principal objective of the ICC is to create unity amongst the Inuit to be able to promote their common agenda on the international level. In addition, the ICC stresses the importance of sustainable environmental management in order to preserve the wildlife and biological diversity and recalls the right of Inuit to the natural resources in their traditional areas. =Russian Association of Indigenous Peoples of the North - RAIPON= Russian Association of Indigenous Peoples of the North was created in 1990 at the First Congress of Indigenous Peoples of the North. The Association was originally called the \\"Association of Peoples of the North of the USSR\\" and united 26 indigenous groups of the North Russia. Today, RAIPON unites 41 indigenous groups whose total population is around 250,000 people. These peoples are represented by 34 regional and ethnic organizations that have the authority to represent these groups both in Russia and in the international community. RAIPON is a permanent participant at the Arctic Council. RAIPON is an observer of UNEP Governing Council/Global Ministerial Environment Forum. RAIPON is an observer of World Intellectual Property Organization's Committee on Intellectual Property and Genetic Resources, Traditional Knowledge and Folklore.Aiming to develop new knowledge about the interaction of actors in the High North, conducted by the Norwegian institute for defence Studies with partners and associates. =The Saami Council - SC= The Saami Council is a non-governmental Saami organization (NGO), with member organizations in Finland, Russia, Norway and Sweden. Since its foundation in 1956 the Saami Council has actively dealt with Saami policy tasks. The primary aims of the Saami Council are the promotion of Saami rights and interests in the four countries having Saami population, to consolidate the feeling of affinity among the Saami people, to attain recognition for the Saami as one nation and to promote economic, social and cultural rights of the Saami in the legislation of the four states, Norway, Sweden, Russia and Finland. Saami Council renders opinions and makes proposals on questions concerning Saami people's rights, language and culture.

V√§sterg√∂tland Runic Inscription 90 or Vg 90 is the Rundata listing for a Viking Age memorial runestone located in Torestorp, which is about three kilometers northwest of Gudhem, V√§stra G√∂taland County, Sweden, and in the historic province of V√§sterg√∂tland. Description The inscription on Vg 90 consists of runes carved in the younger futhark in a text band that forms an arch that then curves back in the interior for one word. A small cross is in the upper part of the interior. The stone, which is made of limestone and is 2.1 meters in height, is classified as being carved in runestone style RAK, which is considered to be the oldest style. This is the classification where the ends of the text bands are straight and do not have any attached serpent or beast heads. The runestone, which is located on a natural hill, was noted in a letter written by King Magnus III in 1287. This is believed to be the first modern notice of the existence of runestones in Sweden. The unnamed runemaster who carved Vg 90 is also believed to have carved inscription Vg 85 in Stora Dala. The runic text states that the stone was raised by a man named Br√≥√∞ir as a memorial for a son whose name cannot be clearly determined. The deceased son is described as being har√∞a go√∞an dr√¶ng or \\"a very good valiant man,\\" using the term drengr. A drengr in Denmark was a term mainly associated with members of a warrior group. It has been suggested that drengr along with thegn was first used as a title associated with men from Denmark and Sweden in service to Danish kings, but, from its context in inscriptions, over time became more generalized and was used by groups such as merchants or the crew of a ship. Other runestones describing the deceased using the words har√æa go√æan dr√¶ng in some order include DR 1 in Haddeby, DR 68 in √Örhus, DR 77 in Hjermind, DR 127 in Hobro, DR 268 in √ñstra Vemmenh√∂g, DR 276 in √ñrsj√∂, DR 288 and DR 289 in Bj√§resj√∂, Sm 48 in Torp, Vg 61 in H√§rlingstorp, Vg 112 in √Ös, Vg 114 in B√∂rjesg√•rden, the now-lost Vg 126 in Larvs, Vg 130 in Sk√•num, Vg 153 and Vg 154 in F√∂lene, Vg 157 in Storeg√•rden, Vg 162 in Bengtsg√•rden, Vg 179 in Lilleg√•rden, Vg 181 in Frug√•rden, Vg 184 in Smula (using a plural form), the now-lost √ñg 60 in J√§rmstastenen, √ñg 104 in Gillberga, and possibly on U 610 in Granhammar. On Vg 90, the runes trik for \\"drengr\\" have been emphasized by their placement on the portion of the text band that bends back in the interior, although one scholar has suggested that this arrangement may have been caused by \\"faulty planning\\" on the part of the runemaster. p. 469. If the name of the father is correctly read as Br√≥√∞ir, the runemaster spelled the name as bur√æi Ä using a reverse-read \\"ur.\\" A punctuation mark consisting of a √ó was used as a word divider between each word of the runic text.

All proposed routes for a tunnel and/or canal route from the Mediterranean Sea towards the Qattara Depression The Qattara Depression Project, or Qattara Project for short, is a macro-engineering project concept in Egypt. Rivalling the Aswan High Dam in scope, the intention is to develop the hydroelectric potential of the Qattara Depression by creating an artificial lake. Location The Qattara depression is a region that lies 60 m below sea level on average and is currently a vast, uninhabited desert. By connecting the region and the Mediterranean Sea with tunnels and/or canals, water could be let into the area. The inflowing water would then evaporate quickly because of the desert climate. This way a continuous flow of water could be created if inflow and evaporation were balanced out. With this continuously flowing water, hydroelectricity could be generated. Eventually, this would result in a hypersaline lake or a salt pan as the water evaporates and leaves the salt it contains behind. This would return the Qattara Depression to its current state but with its sabkha soils tens of meters higher. Construction proposals The proposals call for a large canal or tunnel being excavated of about depending on the route chosen to the Mediterranean Sea to bring seawater into the area.Ragheb, M. 2010.

By balancing the inflow and evaporation, the lake's water level can be held constant. Several proposed lake levels are 70, 60 and 50 meters below sea level. History The first documented person to suggest flooding large parts of the Sahara desert was French geographer Fran√ßois √âlie Roudaire whose proposal inspired the writer Jules Verne's final book Invasion of the Sea. Plans to use the Qattara Depression for the generation of electricity reportedly date back to 1912 from Berlin geographer Albrecht Penck.Murakami M. Managing water for peace in the Middle East United Nations University Press. p.64-66 = Ball period = The subject was first discussed in more detail by Dr. John Ball in 1927. Dr. Ball also made the first preliminary calculations on the achievable filling rate, inflow rate, electricity production and salinity. Non-Egyptians seemed to be unaware of Qattara's existence until after the First World War. The credit for its \\"discovery\\" goes to Dr. John Ball, English director of the Survey of Egypt, who oversaw the mapping of the depression in 1927 and who first suggested using it to generate hydroelectricity.Koger, Grove. 1999. \\"The Great Sahara Sea: An Idea Whose Time Has Come.\\" Mercator's World. Volume 4 (2). March/April 1999. Page 23. In 1957 the American Central Intelligence Agency proposed to President Dwight Eisenhower that peace in the Middle East could be achieved by flooding the Qattara Depression. The resulting lagoon, according to the CIA, would have four benefits:MI: Gale. 2009. Farmington Hills, CIA Suggestions, Document Number CK3100127026. Reproduced in \\"Declassified Documents Reference System\\" * It would be spectacular and peaceful. * It would materially alter the climate in adjacent areas. * It would provide work during construction and living areas after completion for the Palestinian Arabs. * It would get Egyptian president Gamel Abdel Nasser's \\"mind on other matters\\" because \\"he need[ed] some way to get off the Soviet Hook.\\" = Bassler period = From 1964 onward Prof. Friedrich Bassler led the international \\"Board of Advisers\\" which was responsible for planning and financing activities of the project. He also advised the Egyptian government on the matter from 1975 onward. He was appointed to make a first preliminary feasibility study by the German Federal Ministry of Economics in Bonn. Bassler was the driving force behind the Qattara Project for nearly a decade. Half way through the seventies a team of eight mostly German scientists and technicians was working on the planning of the first hydro-solar depression power station in the world. The first \\"Bassler study\\" of 1973 laid the basis for the Egyptian government to commission a study of its own. It decided in 1975 that Bassler and a group of companies known as \\"Joint Venture Qattara\\" should conduct a feasibility study of the project. The project concept was: Mediterranean water should be channeled through a canal or tunnel towards the Qattara Depression which lies below sea level. This water would then fall into the depression through penstocks for electricity generation. The water would evaporate quickly because of the very dry and hot weather once in the depression. This would allow for more water to enter the depression and would create a continuous source of electricity. A canal 60 meters deep would connect the Mediterranean with the depressions edge at this narrow isthmus. This canal would deliver water to the depression as well as being a shipping route towards the Qattara lake with a harbor and fishing grounds in the depression. The depression was to be filled to a height of 60 m below sea level. It would take a total of 10 years to fill to that level. After that the incoming flow would balance out against the outgoing evaporation and would cause the lake level to stop changing. In the first phase of the project the Qattara 1 station was to generate 670 megawatts. The second phase was to generate an additional 1,200 megawatts. A pumped-storage hydroelectricity facility would increase the peak production capacity with another 4,000 megawatts, totaling about 5,800 megawatts. The core problem of the project was the cost and technical difficulty of diverting seawater to the depression. Calculations showed that digging a canal or tunnel would be too expensive. Demining would be needed to remove bypass some of the millions of unexploded ordnance left from World War II in Northern Egypt. Consequently, use of nuclear explosives to excavate the canal was another proposal by Bassler. This plan called for the detonation in boreholes of 213 nuclear devices, each yielding 1.5 megatons (i.e. 100 times that of the atomic bomb used against Hiroshima). This fit within the Atoms for Peace program proposed by President Dwight Eisenhower in 1953. Evacuation plans cited numbers of at least 25,000 evacuees. The shock waves from the explosion might also affect the tectonically unstable Red Sea Rift located just 450 km away from the blast site. Another danger was increased coast erosion because sea currents could change in such a way that even very remote coastal areas would erode. Because of the concerns about using a nuclear solution the Egyptian government turned down the plan, and the project's stakeholders gave up on the project. = Continued interest = Since then, scientists and engineers still occasionally explore the viability of such a project, as a key to resolving economic, population, and ecological stresses in the area, but the project has yet to be undertaken.Hafiez, Ragab A. 2011.

It is used to provide software development and QA/testing teams access to dependent system components that are needed to exercise an application under test (AUT), but are unavailable or difficult-to-access for development and testing purposes. With the behavior of the dependent components \\"virtualized\\", testing and development can proceed without accessing the actual live components. Service virtualization is recognized by vendors, industry analysts, and industry publications as being different than mocking.Service Virtualization as an Alternative to Mocking, by Jonathan Allen, eBizQ April 22, 2013Service virtualization arises to meet services testing obstacles, by George Lawton, SearchSOA May 15, 2012 See here for a Comparison of API simulation tools. Overview Service virtualization emulates the behavior of software components to remove dependency constraints on development and testing teams. Such constraints occur in complex, interdependent environments when a component connected to the application under test is: * Not yet completed * Still evolving * Controlled by a third-party or partner * Available for testing only in limited capacity or at inconvenient times * Difficult to provision or configure in a test environment * Needed for simultaneous access by different teams with varied test data setup and other requirements * Restricted or costly to use for load and performance testing Service Virtualization for Modern Applications by Gaurish Hattangadi, Virtual Strategy Magazine, November 28, 2010 Although the term \\"service virtualization\\" reflects the technique's initial focus on virtualizing web services, service virtualization extends across all aspects of composite applications: services, databases, mainframes, ESBs, and other components that communicate using common messaging protocols. Managing Test Environments by Liz McMillan, Cloud Computing Journal, December 2011Application Behavior Virtualization by Elizabeth White, Cloud Computing Journal, December 2011Database Virtualization For Development and Test by Wayne Ariola, ST & QA Magazine, March 2012 Other similar tools are called API simulators, API mocking tools, over the wire test doubles. Service virtualization emulates only the behavior of the specific dependent components that developers or testers need to exercise in order to complete their end-to-end transactions. Rather than virtualizing entire systems, it virtualizes only specific slices of dependent behavior critical to the execution of development and testing tasks. This provides just enough application logic so that the developers or testers get what they need without having to wait for the actual service to be completed and readily available. For instance, instead of virtualizing an entire database (and performing all associated test data management as well as setting up the database for every test session), you monitor how the application interacts with the database, then you emulate the related database behavior (the SQL queries that are passed to the database, the corresponding result sets that are returned, and so forth).An Intro to SOA and Virtualization by John Michelsen, WebServices.org, August 2007 The Next Generation of Test Environment Management by Wayne Ariola, Virtualization Journal, July 12, 2011 Application Service virtualization involves creating and deploying a \\"virtual asset\\" that simulates the behavior of a real component which is required to exercise the application under test, but is difficult or impossible to access for development and testing purposes. A virtual asset stands in for a dependent component by listening for requests and returning an appropriate response‚Äîwith the appropriate performance. For a database, this might involve listening for a SQL statement, then returning data source rows. For a web service, this might involve listening for an XML message over HTTP, JMS, or MQ, then returning another XML message. The virtual asset's functionality and performance might reflect the actual functionality/performance of the dependent component, or it might simulate exceptional conditions (such as extreme loads or error conditions) to determine how the application under test responds under those circumstances. Virtual assets are typically created by: * Recording live communication among components as the system is exercised from the application under test (AUT) * Providing logs representing historical communication among components * Analyzing service interface specifications (such as a WSDL) * Defining the behavior manually with various interface controls and data source values They are then further configured to represent specific data, functionality, and response times. Virtual assets are deployed locally or in the cloud (public or private). With development/test environments configured to use the virtual assets in place of dependent components, developers or testers can then exercise the application they are working on without having to wait for the dependent components to be completed or readily accessible. Industry analysts report that service virtualization is best suited for \\"IT shops with significant experience with 'skipping' integration testing due to 'dependent software', and with a reasonably sophisticated test harness. Parasoft and \\"Service Virtualization\\" Testing: A Good Idea by Wayne Kernochan, Thoughts From a Software IT Analyst, February 22, 2013 Relation to stubbing and mocking An alternative approach to working around the test environment access constraints outlined in this article's introduction is for team members to develop method stubs or mock objects that substitute for dependent resources. The shortcoming of this approach became apparent in the early 2000s with the rise of Service-oriented architecture.Testing in Service-Oriented Environments by Ed Morris et al, Software Engineering Institute, March 2010 The proliferation of Composite applications that rely on numerous dependent services, plus the rise of Agile software development following the 2001 publication of the Agile Manifesto, made it increasingly difficult for developers or testers to manually develop the number, scope, and complexity of stubs or mocks required to complete development and testing tasks for modern enterprise application development.Service virtualization is helping organizations realize business value from testing by Chandranshu Singh, ovum, March 31, 2014 The first step in the evolution from stubbing to service virtualization was the technology packaged in SOA testing tools since 2002.Parasoft's Web Service Testing Tool Should Aid Development by Theresa Lanowitz Gartner, May 1, 2002 The earliest implementations of service virtualization were designed to automate the process of developing simple stub-like emulations so that composite applications could be tested more efficiently.SOA virtualization gets real by Rich Seeley, SearchSOA, November 28, 2007 As enterprise systems continued to grow increasingly complex and distributed, software tool vendors shifted focus from stubbing to the more environment-focused service virtualization. While stubbing can still be completed through manual development and management of stubs, what has become known as \\"service virtualization\\" is completed by using one of the available commercial off the shelf (COTS) service virtualization technologies as a platform for the development and deployment of their \\"service virtualization assets\\". Agile and DevOps The increasing popularityAgile & DevOps Google Trends of Agile software development and DevOps has created demand for a new set of tools to deliver service virtualization to communities that work in this way.Next Gen Service Virtualization Forum, 13th of September 2017 Practices such as Continuous delivery and moving away from mainframe and monolith development to more distributed microservice-based architectures fit well with the capabilities of service virtualization. Agile and DevOps teams prefer to work with lightweight tools that have less accumulated bloat and no cumbersome licensing restrictions.Thought Works Technology Radar: Big enterprise solutions  See also  * Comparison of API simulation tools * Test double References Category:Software engineering Category:Software testing Category:Quality assurance ","title":"Service virtualization"},{"id":"34519336","text":"Tappeh Shir Khan (, also Romanized as Tappeh Shƒ´r KhƒÅn and Tappeh-ye Shƒ´rkhƒÅn) is a village in Beyranvand-e Shomali Rural District, Bayravand District, Khorramabad County, Lorestan Province, Iran.

The park site is a peninsula projecting into the East River roughly opposite the College Point and Malba neighborhoods of Queens. The park is located on the eastern shore of Westchester Creek, adjacent to the neighborhood of Throggs Neck. The park is operated by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. The Hutchinson River Expressway (Interstate 678) crosses the park to the Bronx- Whitestone Bridge, splitting it into east and west sides. The east side of the park has a golf course called Trump Ferry Point, a community park, and a waterfront promenade. The east side borders are Saint Raymond's Cemetery; Balcom Avenue, Miles Avenue and Emerson Avenue; and the East River and the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge. The west side is heavily used for soccer, cricket, fishing and barbecues. Friends of Ferry Point Park holds cleanup events, plantings and helps care for the 3,000 trees planted in the park as the Ferry Point 9/11 Memorial Grove and 9/11 Living Memorial Forest. These trees were donated by the Prince of Monaco. History A large boulder, possibly a glacial erratic, sits in the west side of the park near the base of the Bronx- Whitestone Bridge. Ferry Point is named after the Ferris family, who were 18th-century residents of Throggs Neck. By the 19th century, the area had developed into a fashionable public summer resort, which also contained large German beer gardens, to which the residents of Yorkville, Manhattan (then a heavily German neighborhood) arrived by steamboat service up the East River. The 19th-century steamboat landing at Ferris Dock on Westchester Creek stood at present-day Brush Avenue north of Wenner Place; the road to it bore the name of the steamboat Osseo. The first house to be built in the Bronx was reportedly the Charlton Ferris House, built in 1687 along Ferris Avenue between Wenner Place, Brush Avenue and Lafayette Avenue. It was situated on the estate of Albert L. Lovenstein. Several other large and handsome 18th- century Ferris houses were built in the neighborhood, of which two lasted until the 1960s. Commac Street was nearby and parallel to Osseo and later demapped as well. The city sold this 6 acres to be developed and it had become a truck parking facility as of 2012. Wenner Place terminated at Westchester Creek and for many generations was used as a boat launch. New York City cut off the access to this Creek as it sold off the waterfront to developers. Neighbors are advocating for a boat launch at the nearby east side of this park and a kayak launch on the west side. In 1937, New York City acquired the land for Ferry Point Park in preparation for the construction of the Bronx- Whitestone Bridge. The land had belonged to the Roman Catholic House of the Good Shepherd. The original parcel was called 'Old Ferry' and was located at the confluence of the Westchester Creek and the Baxter Creek Inlet. Baxter Creek later became the East side of the park when it was filled in by landfill. In the 1930s, New York City Parks Commissioner Robert Moses planned a beach, bathhouse, cafeteria complex, bus terminal and parking field for the site, but none were ever built. The landscaped west-side parkland was opened to the public in 1940. In 1948, were added to the park by condemnation, bringing it to its current land area. The west side of the park was well utilized by churches, schools, and visitors from Parkchester, Castle Hill and Throggs Neck apartments. The east side underwent years of raw garbage Landfill under the authority of the Department of Sanitation (began in 1952 and continued until 1970). Facilities The east side of Ferry Point Park is equipped with sports fields, basketball and handball courts. The west side has barbecue areas, 8 soccer fields, 2 cricket fields and the 9/11 Living Memorial Forest and Hilltop Grove. Early 2000s plans for revitalizing Ferry Point Park included an 18-hole golf course and an adjacent community park and waterfront promenade were developed by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. The adjacent parks were design by Thomas Balsley Associates and the golf course was designed by Jack Nicklaus in collaboration with John Sanford. Laws Construction built the community park, which opened in 2012, and the golf course, which opened in 2015. The Trump Organization received the city's concessionaire contract to grow-in and maintain the golf course and run the general golf operations. The community park includes new baseball field, basketball court, playground, trails and comfort station. The proposed waterfront promenade plans include comfort station, picnic areas, trails and the ecological revitalization of the waterfront on the east side near the East River Crescent area. Although there is much ado about the absence of construction on the comfort station on the west side, thousands of weekly visitors do not have running water or restrooms. Transportation The New York City Bus-operated Q44 and the MTA Bus-operated Q50 bus lines stop near Ferry Point Park. Additionally, the park is accessible from the Bronx‚ÄìWhitestone Bridge.

The episode was co-written by Dawn Prestwich and Nicole Yorkin and was directed by Gwyneth Horder-Payton. In the episode, councilman Richmond suspects a leak within his team. Sarah tracks down a witness, which leads to a suspect, while trying to work with her new awkward partner Holder. Plot At Fort Washington High, Sarah (Mireille Enos) discovers a peephole in The Cage. Principal Meyers (Kerry Sandomirsky) unlocks a room adjoining The Cage to which only she and school janitor Lyndon Johnson Rosales have a key. The peephole provides a clear view of The Cage. Later, Oakes (Garry Chalk) asks Sarah to remain on the job through the end of the week because he feels that Holder isn't currently capable of controlling the case. Holder (Joel Kinnaman) boasts to Sarah about finding the crime scene. She dismisses it as an assumption and orders him to stop intimidating suspects. In Rosales‚Äô apartment, Holder distracts the mother while Sarah explores. When she notices a teen-themed porn magazine on the floor, Rosales (VJ Delos Reyes) comes up behind her and slashes her arm with a knife. Holder rushes him, with gun drawn, while Sarah pleads with Rosales that they just want to talk to him. He jumps out the window. At the hospital, Rosales is diagnosed with a skull fracture and rushed into surgery. While a medic stitches and bandages Sarah's arm, Holder lists the suspect's priors: indecent exposure and \\"kid diddlin'.\\" He also notes that this suspect has an alibi: picked up for a DUI, he spent Friday night in the drunk tank. In his hospital room, Sarah questions Rosales. He confirms seeing Rosie, but not Jasper, at the Halloween dance. Pointing to a yearbook photo of Kris Echols, Rosales whispers, \\"El diablo (Spanish for 'the devil').\\" Reporters ask mayoral candidate Richmond (Billy Campbell) about the Rosie Larsen case. He insists that the case is not about politics. Councilwoman Yitanes (Lee Garlington) calls Richmond a liar and says she's withdrawing her endorsement. At City Hall, Mayor Adams (Tom Butler) offers to endorse Richmond in four years, if he abandons his current campaign, and hints that the police had informed him about the discovery of Rosie in a campaign car. Later, Richmond tells Sarah about the Rosie press leak, but she denies the police as the source. He then meets secretly with Nathan (Peter Benson), who clears Jamie and Gwen of campaign car press leak but produces an office e-mail showing who leaked the Yitanes endorsement to the press. Richmond shows Gwen (Kristin Lehman) the e-mail ‚Äî Jamie is the leak. They discuss Jamie's possible motivation for the betrayal. Gwen thinks that Jamie is playing both sides in the race, so he can feel like no matter who is elected, he has won either way. At a street basketball game to promote an anti-gang initiative, Richmond mentions the endorsement leak to Jamie, who blames the cops and then Yitanes, adding that everyone is playing both sides. In Richmond's office, Jamie comes up with a plan to win back Yitanes's endorsement by offering her husband a city plumbing contract. Gwen then accuses him of being the Yitanes leak. He claims that his computer was hacked, then accuses Richmond of letting sex (with Gwen) cloud his judgment and leaves. Yitanes enters Richmond's office, confronting him about his suggesting to the press that she'll still endorse him. Richmond offers her the contracting deal in return for her support. She later officially endorses Richmond during a press conference as Jamie quietly leaves the office with a box of his belongings under his arm. Holder tells Oakes and Sarah about Kris, a runaway expelled from high school and Jasper's best friend. Reviewing video from the dance, Sarah notices someone wearing a devil's mask. She whispers, ‚ÄúEl diablo.‚Äù While visiting the Larsens, she reveals that Rosie's cause of death was drowning, then learns that Kris lived nearby until three years ago. At the police station, Kris's mother admits to Holder that she gave up on her son, adding that he mainly hangs out at a skateboard park. At the skate park, Holder smokes a joint and talks with a teenage girl, who confirms that Kris is a regular there. Returning to the car and reeking of smoke, Holder assures Sarah that what he is smoking is \\"narcscent\\", a substitute that narcotics officers use that looks, smells, and tastes like marijuana. After noticing that the skate park is within walking distance to the Richmond campaign office's parking lot, Sarah wonders if Kris stole the campaign car. Holder later spots Kris, pins him down, and asks if he caused Rosie to overdose. Sarah tells Holder to release Kris. Later, outside the school, Kris accuses Jasper (Richard Harmon) of telling the police they were at the dance. Watching from a distance, Sarah notes to Holder that Rosie wouldn't have entered The Cage with Kris, but would have with someone she trusted, ‚Äúlike Jasper.‚Äù Inside, after confiscating a cell phone from a student, a teacher (Brandon Jay McLaren) later hears it ring. While trying to silence it, he starts a video. At the police station, Sarah, Oakes, and Holder watch the cell-phone video. The footage shows a male, wearing a devil's mask, forcing himself on a girl in a pink wig and a witch costume. The male mentions Rosie's name. When the devil's mask is taken off, the male is revealed to be Jasper. Jasper then switches roles with the cameraman, who turns out to be Kris. Oakes tells his detectives to bring in both boys. At the Larsen's apartment, father Stan (Brent Sexton) and the boys eat quietly. In the bathroom, Mitch (Michelle Forbes) clings to the side of the bathtub, crying. Production In an interview with Mina Hochberg at AMCTV.com, Dawn Prestwich and Nicole Yorkin, co-writers of the episode and series producers, spoke about the excitement of working on the series: \\"We get away with doing the least amount of exposition possible,\\" Prestwich began. \\"We want the audience to feel like they've just stepped into the world and nobody is going to stop and explain it to them. They need to keep up and join the team of Holder and Linden and learn along the way.\\" Yorkin then stated: \\"Another thing was the fact that our lead character is a working mom and Dawn and I have been working moms our entire career. As has Veena [Sud, series creator]. You don't get to write a complex character...\\" Prestwich added, \\"...that is really lovable but makes mistakes. I mean, we don't approve of the way she is raising Jack and we know that she's failing in some ways.\\" Yorkin finished with: \\"The interesting debate that we had in the room all the time (which I've talked to enough people now who watch the show to know they have the same debate) is Sarah a bad mom or is she just an imperfect mom like most of us? I think there are not many shows that portray a working mom this honestly.\\" Reception The episode received favorable reviews. Meredith Blake of The A.V. Club rated this episode a B, saying \\"So far, The Killing doesn‚Äôt offer much variety in terms of mood; it‚Äôs pretty much unrelenting gloom, with some moments of overwhelming menace thrown in for good measure. If it‚Äôs possible, [this] episode was darker and more disturbing than the premiere last week.\\" TV Fanatic's Teresa L. rated the episode 4.5 out of 5 stars and stated \\"Although the format of The Killing will make it difficult to keep the ideas fresh and the plot developments realistic, the show still retains its authentic feel without becoming tiresome and boring. 'El Diablo' continued to showcase the unique qualities of this riveting crime drama.\\" \\"El Diablo\\" was watched by 2.56 million viewers, a slight drop from the previous episodes.

On 12 December 2011, the band revealed the first teaser from the album on their website, with a video from the studio, with 3 more videos to be revealed before the album's release. During early January 2012, the band recorded b-sides, bonus tracks and alternate versions of songs for the album's release. In a press release, Carter described the album: \\"With this album we totally threw out the rulebook of how we write and record. We decided we wanted to make a really ambitious record, not something which reflects our live show but something which is only limited by our imaginations and not by how many instruments we use onstage. We figured the best way to push ourselves forward was to write the best possible songs and melodies we could - once you have that as your foundation, you have the freedom to go anywhere with the sounds you use.

Unlike most shorts made by the studio, the film employs both animation and live-action. Storyline Oswald, still depicted in the white fur he got fourteen cartoons ago, is putting up marionette puppet show. The first act consists of an Arab man attempting to charm a snake out of the basket. The second act shows a pair of Spanish dancers. And finally, the third act features an African American quartet: one playing the piano, one singing while sitting on it, and two doing tap dancing. Things were going well for Oswald until a bee disturbingly hovers around him. The bunny tries to shoo away the insect, only to end up getting stung in the rear. Oswald then jumps off his stool in pain, and quickly moves backward. After colliding the wall behind the stage, a vase drops on his head, putting the daylights out of him. For several minutes, the rabbit remains out cold, leaving his puppets lying on the stage. Oswald dreams about two of his puppets, the African American tap dancers, being alive. After being kept in an auditorium for a long time with no one to play with them, one of the puppets expresses desire to freely wander the world. The other, however, warns that the outside may not be safe and that they can't do much unless someone moves their strings. The freedom-hungry puppet does not buy the advice, and therefore makes the move. The puppet sets foot just outside the auditorium. He tries to dance but his moves are limited. Realizing the truth of one of the things said by his friend, the puppet attached a pack of balloons onto the holder of his strings. Thus he was able to dance better, and goes on into the outside world. The outside world visited by the puppet is populated with living toys who were intrigued to see someone suspending on strings. While he wanders, a hostile doll from afar shoots arrows at his balloons. With each one bursting, he loses control of his limbs. Finally crippled, the other toys recognize he's a puppet. The prejudiced toys express their hatred to puppets and declare \\"we'll saw you into blocks of wood\\". They tie the puppet to a table where he is about to be cut in half by a circular saw. At last, Oswald wakes up from his slumber. He quickly returns above the stage, picks up his puppets, and continues the show. Reception Motion Picture Herald (Oct 17, 1936): \\"The outstanding feature in this edition of Oswald's adventures is the exhibition of some skillful puppet work. Used as a background for the antics of the comic rabbit, such delightful puppetry lends a novel note of entertainment.\\" National Exhibitor (Nov 5, 1936): \\"The endeavor to do something different results this time in Oswald the cartoon character pulling cartoon strings of real photographed puppets, in the manner of Max Fleischer's old Out of the Inkwell series. The novelty is refreshing but the entertainment is so-so.\\" Notes *As always, Oswald is animated. But the puppets he plays are live-action, except those in his dream. *A restored version of the cartoon is featured on The Woody Woodpecker and Friends Classic Cartoon Collection: Volume 2.

Roll was the U.S. Vice Consul in Copenhagen in 1921 and in Bremen from 1926‚Äì1929. Early life William George Roll was born on July 4, 1892 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the son of Norwegian immigrants. The eldest of three sons and two daughters, he attended schools in Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands, and the United States. His brother Sigurd Roll was also a diplomat as well as an olympic sprinter. Career When the U.S. entered World War I, Roll enlisted in the Army, and was sent to Denmark to engage in covert activities in Germany, heading a team of six agents. Following the war, the State Department appointed him Vice Consul in Denmark, where he served for two years under President Woodrow Wilson. The State Department then transferred Roll to Bremen, Germany, where he was stationed as Vice Consul for eight years. From then, till the outbreak of World War II, he continued to carry out missions for the State Department throughout the world. With the entrance of the U.S. into the European theater of World War II, Roll returned to the Army and served on SHAEF under General Dwight Eisenhower. He saw duty on most of the major European fronts. When Lt. Colonel Roll learned of his brother Sigurd's death, he was determined to avenge him.

It is thought to have been first built during the Three Kingdoms Period, but the existing tower structure was built during the Northern Song dynasty. The pagoda underwent several renovations over various dynastic periods, which resulted in the addition of several architectural features that were not in the typical style of the Song dynasty. After the establishment of the People‚Äôs Republic of China, these later additions were removed and rebuilt in the Song dynasty style. Because of this, the pagoda has now been largely restored to its original appearance. The pagoda was twice established as a Shanghai Cultural Site Under State Protection, once on 26 May 1959 and again on 7 December 1997. On 25 May 2006, it was declared by the State Council to be among the sixth group of Major Historical and Cultural Sites Protected at the National Level.  History  Longhua Pagoda (1875 or 1876) Longhua Pagoda, traditionally referred to as ‚ÄúWriting Brush Peak‚Äù (), is thought to have originally been constructed along with Longhua Temple in the state of Wu‚Äôs Chiwu era during the Three Kingdoms Period (242-247). Its main function was housing precious Sharira relics. The pagoda was restored under an imperial edict during the Chuigong era (678) of the Tang dynasty, but it was burnt down again during the Huang Chao peasant uprising in the first year of the Guangming era (880). The main structure of the existing pagoda was constructed under the direction of King Qian Chu of Wuyue in the Taiping Xingguo era (977) of the Northern Song dynasty. The pagoda was located in Longhua Temple when it was first built, and underwent renovation in the Taiping era (1066) of the Northern Song dynasty, and in the Shaoxing era (1147) of the Southern Song dynasty. Longhua Temple was destroyed during the war towards the end of the Yuan dynasty, but the pagoda was unharmed. It was renovated during the Wanli (1591) and Chongzhen (1630) eras of the Ming dynasty, and the Kangxi (1668) and Daoguang (1827) eras of the Qing dynasty, respectively. In the Guangxu era (1891), Longhua Road was constructed. This road passed through the former site of the temple, with the temple situated on its north side and the pagoda on its south side. A new courtyard was then built around the pagoda. In 1892, during the Guangxu era, a fire broke out that destroyed the pagoda‚Äôs ground floor peridrome. One artistically talented monk of Longhua Temple sold his own paintings in order to raise funds for the ancient pagoda‚Äôs restoration. In 1920, military troops were stationed at Longhua Temple, which caused the majority of its monks to be displaced. During this period, Zhang Muhan, the troop‚Äôs regimental commander, and Yuan Zhao, a monk of Longhua Temple, raised funds for Longhua Pagoda‚Äôs restoration. In the process of the pagoda‚Äôs renovation, its original wooden railings were removed and replaced with cement and steel banisters. More barriers were also added to the peridromes. According to the folk legend believed by Zhang Muhan, the pagoda was built by Sun Quan in order to express gratitude for his mother‚Äôs nurturing of him. For this reason, a plaque inscribed with ‚ÄúPagoda of Gratitude‚Äù was hung above the pagoda‚Äôs entrance. In 1926, Longhua Pagoda was struck by lightning, which destroyed the guardrails on its third and fourth stories. The fifth, sixth and seventh stories of the pagoda, along with its base, were split by a lightning strike. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the pagoda sustained further damage. In 1945, figures such as Huang Jinrong and Zhang Fanggeng raised funds for the pagoda to be repaired. After the People‚Äôs Republic of China was established, Longhua Pagoda underwent repair and renovation from 1954 until 1955. This resulted in it being largely restored to its original Song Dynasty form. On 26 May 1959, Longhua Pagoda was declared a Shanghai Cultural Site Under State Protection. In 1962, the pagoda was refurbished. In the early morning of 6 September 1962, a tornado descended on Longhua from the north west, but the pagoda was unharmed. On 25 August 1966, a Red Guard tied the pagoda to a tractor in an attempt to tear it down. When this failed, they attempted to set fire to the pagoda using gasoline. After being blocked by local residents, the Red Guard ultimately ceased the attempt. On the afternoon of 27 August, a note was attached to the pagoda stating that it would be demolished in the ‚ÄúDestroy the Four Olds‚Äù campaign. The Longhua District Party Committee and the Township People‚Äôs Congress put people in place and took preventative measures. The next day, local people hung large banners bearing Cultural Revolution political slogans from the south, north and west sides of the pagoda. This prevented it from being destroyed in the Cultural Revolution. On 7 December 1977, Longhua Pagoda was, for the second time, declared a Shanghai Cultural Site Under State Protection. Between 1984 and 1985, Longhua Pagoda‚Äôs finial was replaced due to severe corrosion of the tower‚Äôs wooden core. In 1986, the pagoda‚Äôs scope of protection and span of control were determined. The scope of protection was within 50 meters of the pagoda. The span of control was 50‚Äì100 meters from the south and east sides, and 50‚Äì150 meters from the north side. At the beginning of 1990, the finial on top of the pagoda was once again refurbished. Lighting equipment was also installed on the tower at this time. In 1999, the lighting equipment was upgraded and the structure was repainted. In 1999, the incline of the pagoda increased to 104 cm. On 25 May 2006, the State Council announced that Longhua Pagoda was now a Major Historical and Cultural Site Protected at the National Level.  Structure  Longhua Pagoda is composed of wood and brick, and is built in the style of a pavilion. The pagoda consists of seven octagonal levels totaling a height of 40.64 meters. Its core is hollow and tube-like, and its outer form is octagonal. The interior of the first story is octagonal, and the interiors of the other stories are square. The stories decrease in size from the bottom to the top. Each story contains four doorways and four rectangular shrines, but the shrines do not contain statues of Buddhas. The positions of these doorways and shrines rotate by 45¬∞ on each story. The floors of each story constitute the wooden structure. There are also wooden stairs which provide access to the seventh story. Under each floor there is a hidden brick post, and an entasis at the top of each post which splits into three sections. The corner bracket sets on the outer eaves are built in the ‚Äúyuangyuang jiaoshou‚Äù style, which is typical of the Song Dynasty. On the sixth story is the pagoda‚Äôs 18-meter-long central pillar, which connects directly to the finial. The ground floor peridrome stoa‚Äôs column head is spindle-shaped. There are fifteen decorative features on the square column, seven of which are wooden and eight of which are white. The bottom of the square column is in the shape of a zither‚Äôs surface. The railings on each level are in the shape of swastikas, and small bells are hung on the upturned corners of the outer eaves. The top story of the pagoda hosts the finial, which consists of features such as a stupa, a dew basin, seven disks and a bumpa; it is 8 meters tall. The axial pole is held down by four metal ropes. The foundations of the pagoda are below ground level, and consist of joists that are fused together with stones and cement. There is a 13 cm layer of wood filler on top of these joists, which is then topped with five layers of serrated water chestnut style bricks. These bricks are 35.5 cm long, 16 cm wide, and 7.5 cm thick. Above this there is a 170 cm thick fifteen-layer brick foundation. Each side is 70 cm longer than the width of the tower. The foundation is built in this manner in order to maximize the pagoda‚Äôs stability during earthquakes. When a survey was carried out on the pagoda, its underground section could not be examined due to structural concerns. The conditions on the lower levels are therefore unknown.  Protection  Following an inspection by the Shanghai Public Works Department in 1953, it emerged that Longhua Pagoda was leaning to the north, and that its flat cement base was cracked. Its wooden structure was also rotting and its joists were slipping. After discussing the matter with related departments, the Shanghai Department of Cultural Affairs formulated a rush repair plan and began the pagoda‚Äôs refurbishment in accordance with its original Song dynasty design. Dinghui Temple‚Äôs Shuang Pagoda in Suzhou was consulted as a reference throughout the renovation process. The restoration began on 20 October 1954 and was completed in April 1955. During construction, additions from the Ming and Qing Dynasties and the Republican Period that were not included in the pagoda‚Äôs original design were removed. These included the stone stairs added in the Ming Dynasty and the cement railings added in the Republican period. Ant damage to the pagoda was also dealt with, and a lightning rod was added. In 1984, the local Cultural Department found that Longhua Pagoda‚Äôs finial was severely damaged, and that its wooden interior was rotting and had been eroded by termites. The Shanghai Administrative Committee of Cultural Affairs therefore allocated 300,000 yuan to Longhua Temple for repairs. The pagoda‚Äôs 18 meter high wooden core was replaced, as was the finial, which weighed 3.2 tons due to its 18 metal components. The sixth and seventh stories were demolished and rebuilt. The renovations were completed in September 1985. In 2010, the Xuhui District People‚Äôs Government implemented a building height limit around Longhua Pagoda. In addition to protecting the pagoda, this also preserved the local area‚Äôs so-called ‚ÄúEvening Pagoda Scene‚Äù. After the establishment of the PRC, Longhua Pagoda was closed to the public due to preservation concerns. On 21‚Äì22 September and 1‚Äì3 October 2006, the pagoda was opened up to visitors for a limited time. 10 people were permitted entry at once and could stay for approximately 20 minutes. The first to the fifth stories were now accessible. In the interest of the wooden stairs‚Äô preservation, guests wearing high-heeled shoes were not permitted entry.

In 1998, the Nevada Department of Transportation (NDOT) paved over the at-grade crossing of the railroad tracks on Boulder Highway. The sharp skew angle (64 degrees) at this junction, high speeds on the highway, and little to no rail usage made this dangerous crossing a prime candidate for elimination. However, the historical significance of this rail spur and future potential for use by excursion and/or commuter trains merited its preservation. The initial phase of NDOT's Boulder City Bypass project will result in a new grade separation of the highway by 2015, allowing the rails to be reconnected so trains can once again reach Boulder City via Railroad Pass, As of April 10, 2018 the grade separation was complete, effectively allowing trains to reach Henderson.nvculture.org/museums/2018/04/10/ceremony-friday-to-mark- reconnection-of-historic-rail-line-between-henderson-boulder-city/ The Railroad Pass Hotel/Casino, is sited along Boulder Highway on the south side of the pass.

Red Sea Invertebrates. Immel Publishing, London. 224 pp. Description The length of the shell varies between 10 mm and 30 mm The smooth, white, solid shell has an ovate, elongated shape. The pointed spire is composed of ten or eleven slightly convex whorls, distinct and separated by a narrow scaffolding accompanying the suture, which is somewhat undulated. The body whorl is almost as large as all the others together. All whorls are longitudinally ribbed, extremely regular, often terminated at their summit by a small tubercle at the sutures. The shell has spiral rows of chestnut spots. The interstices of the ribs are spirally striated with fine transverse striae . The coloring of this shell is whitish. The shell is ornamented with reddish spots arranged in transverse series, almost always united, and forming three bands upon the upper whorls, and five upon the body whorl. Upon this is often seen also, a large brown and irregular blotch. The aperture ovate, elongated, narrow, and slightly oblique. The outer lip is thick, white, forming a little gutter at .the base. The columella is imperforate at its lower extremity, oblique, bearing three unequal folds. The first is more prominent, is horizontal, thin, and sharp; the two others are oblique and smaller.G.W.

The 8¬Ω whorls of the teleoconch are moderately rounded. They are marked by three strong spiral longitudinal grooves (striations) between the sutures on the early whorls, while on the later ones the peripheral cord becomes completely exposed in the suture, giving these whorls four spiral cords. These spiral cords are truncated posteriorly and slope gently anteriorly. They are a little wider than the grooves that separate them. The grooves are crossed by numerous, very slender, somewhat protractive axial riblets. The sutures are scarcely differentiated from the spiral grooves. The periphery of the body whorl is bounded posteriorly by a spiral groove. Anteriorly there is no limiting groove to denote the peripheral cord, which is apparent in the suture on the preceding turns, where the periphery passes evenly into a short, well-rounded base, which is marked by exceedingly fine, spiral striations and lines of growth. The aperture is subquadrate. The posterior angle is obtuse. The outer lip is thin, showing the external sculpture within, rendered wavy at the edge by the external sculpture.

This gene is part of a complex locus that encodes several UDP-glucuronosyltransferases. The locus includes thirteen unique alternate first exons followed by four common exons. Four of the alternate first exons are considered pseudogenes. Each of the remaining nine 5' exons may be spliced to the four common exons, resulting in nine proteins with different N-termini and identical C-termini. Each first exon encodes the substrate binding site, and is regulated by its own promoter. The enzyme encoded by this gene has moderate glucuronidase activity with phenols.

The length of the shell varies between . (The whorls of the protoconch are decollated.) The ten whorls of the teleoconch are weakly rounded, slightly shouldered and faintly crenulated at the summit. They are marked by lines of growth, which are somewhat variable in strength, the strongest being on the side of the crenulations. The sutures are well impressed. The periphery is marked by a moderately strong, spiral sulcus. The base of the shell is rather long, and is crossed by many lines of growth.

Sea shells of Tropical West America. Marine mollusks from Baja California to Per√∫. (2nd edit.). Stanford University Press pp. 1064 This species was named for Charles Baker Adams (1814-1853), an American naturalist. Description The slender shell has an elongate-conic shape. The early whorls are white, later ones diversely variegated, frequently dark brown, yellowish-brown or purplish-brown on the later turns. It is this striking variegated color pattern which at once distinguishes this species from the other West American forms. The length of the shell varies between 11 mm and 19 mm. The spaces between the sutures are crossed by light areas, which are vertical in the middle, bending suddenly forward at the periphery and the summit, thus forming )-shaped areas. The space immediately below the peripheral sulcus on the base has short light areas, corresponding to those above the sulcus, but with retractive slant. The space between these light areas, near the summit, forms a series of elongated dark spots. The varices which are disposed at irregular intervals are chestnut brown, preceded usually by a band of white. The posterior half of the base is light chestnut brown; the anterior white. The whorls of the protoconch are small, two, forming a planorboid spire whose axis is at right angles to that of the succeeding turns, in the first of which it is about one-half immersed. The twelve whorls of the teleoconch are flattened. They are moderately shouldered at the summit, which is crenulated. The periphery at the body whorl contains a strong sulcus. The base of the shell is moderately long, and well rounded. The entire surface of the spire and the base is marked by fine lines of growth and exceedingly fine, microscopic spiral striations. The aperture is oval;. The convex outer lip is thin, showing the following color markings within: a white zone at the periphery, a narrow chestnut band immediately posterior to the periphery and another at the summit, a broad band extending over half the base immediately below the peripheral zone. Deep within, the lip is reinforced by five strong, spiral cords, one at the periphery, two on the base, and two between the periphery and the summit. The siphonal canal is short. The thin columella is strong, and provided with a strong fasciole. The posterior fold is very strong, and lamellar: the anterior two are very oblique, and slender.Dall & Bartsch, A Monograph of West American Pyramidellid Mollusks, United States National Museum Bulletin 68, p. 21-22: 1909 Distribution This species occurs in the Pacific Ocean on sand and mud along the low-tide zone off San Diego and the Gulf of California.

IFNL3 was formerly named IL28B, but the Human Genome Organization Gene Nomenclature Committee renamed this gene in 2013 while assigning a name to the then newly discovered IFNL4 gene. Together with IFNL1 (formerly IL29) and IFNL2 (formerly IL28A), these genes lie in a cluster on chromosomal region 19q13. IFNL3 shares ~96% amino-acid identity with IFNL2, ~80% identity with IFNL1 and ~30% identity with IFNL4. Interferon lambda genes encode cytokines classified as type III interferons, which are distantly related to type I interferons and the IL-10 family. Type III interferons are induced by viral infection and interact with a heterodimeric class II cytokine receptor that consists of interleukin 10 receptor, beta (IL10RB) and interferon lambda receptor 1 (IFNLR1) to signal via the JAK-STAT anti-viral pathway. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008].  Genetic variants and hepatitis C virus  In 2009 (i.e., before the discovery of IFNL4), results from genome wide association studies (GWAS) indicated that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) lying near IFNL3 (rs12979860, rs8099917 and others) were strongly associated with response to pegylated interferon-Œ± and ribavirin treatment for chronic hepatitis C, as well as spontaneous clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The gene then known as IL28B (now IFNL3) was the closest known gene at the time, so these genetic variants were called ‚ÄúIL28B variants.‚Äù It was assumed that the observed associations reflected differences in the structure or regulation of that gene. However, discovery of IFNL4 revealed that the rs12979860 SNP is located within intron 1 of IFNL4, while rs8099917 lies in an intergenic region, but nearest to IFNL4. The rs12979860 and rs8099917 SNPs are in high linkage disequilibrium with a variant of IFNL4 (IFNL4-ŒîG/TT; rs368234815) that controls generation of the IFNL4 protein. IFNL4-ŒîG/TT appears to be the functional polymorphism that accounts for GWAS associations of nearby SNPs with HCV clearance, and IFNL4-ŒîG/TT was shown to have stronger statistical association with HCV clearance than that of rs12979860, especially in populations of African ancestry in which linkage disequilibrium between these variants is weaker than in other populations. One possible functional variant in IFNL3 is the rs4803217 SNP, which lies in the 3‚Äô untranslated regulatory region. Substitution of guanine for the ancestral thymine at this site increases IFNL3 mRNA expression by decreasing mRNA degradation and HCV-induced microRNA binding and changes the RNA structure. High linkage disequilibrium exists between rs4803217 and the IFNL4-ŒîG/TT variant. rs4803217 has been shown to associate with HCV clearance, however, that association appears to stem from linkage disequilibrium with IFNL4-ŒîG/TT rather than a direct functional effect of the rs4803217 SNP itself.

The rest of the surface is marked by fine lines of growth and exceedingly fine spiral striations. The deep peripheral sulcus is crossed by slender axial riblets, which are more slender and more numerous than the crenulations at the summit of the whorls. The base of the shell is moderately long, and well rounded. It is provided with a strong fasciole at the anterior end and marked by rather strong incremental lines and very fine spiral striations. The aperture is oval. The posterior angle is acute. The outer lip is thin, showing four denticles within, of which the median two are the strongest. The inner lip is thick, almost straight, and provided with three folds, of which the first is lamellar and almost transversely disposed. It covers the posterior portion of the basal fasciole. The other two folds are much weaker and much more obliquely placed and extend to the anterior portion of the columella. The parietal wall is glazed with a thin callus.P.

Kinesin-5 proteins are members of kinesin superfamily, which are nanomotors that move along microtubule tracks in the cell. Named from studies in the early days of discovery, it is also known as kinesin family member 11, encoded by the KIF11 gene, or as BimC, Eg5 or N-2, based on the founding members of this kinesin family. The term kinesin-5 has been recommended based on a standardized nomenclature adopted by the scientific community. Currently, there are over 70 different eukaryotic kinesin-5 proteins identified by sequence similarity. Members of this protein family are known to be involved in various kinds of spindle dynamics and essential for mitosis. The function of this gene product includes chromosome positioning, centrosome separation and establishing a bipolar spindle during cell mitosis. The human Kinesin-5 protein has been actively studied for its role in mitosis and its potential as a therapeutic target for cancer treatment. Function KIF11 (also known as kinesin-5 and Eg5) is a homotetramer which cross-links anti-parallel microtubules in the mitotic spindle to maintain spindle bipolarity. The motor domain or motor head is at the N-terminus and performs ATP hydrolysis and binds to microtubules. Kinesin-5 motors assemble into a bipolar homotetrameric structure that is capable of sliding apart bundles of anti-parallel oriented microtubules. This motor is essential for mitosis in most organisms, wherein it participates in the self-assembly of the microtubule-based mitotic spindle, but is not otherwise required for cell viability. The motor may also play a role in the proper development of mammalian neuronal processes, including growth cone navigation and elongation. Function in mitosis In most eukaryotic cells, Kinesin-5 is thought to form cross-bridges between pairs of oppositely oriented microtubules in prophase and prometaphase and drives apart duplicated centrosomes during the formation of the mitotic spindle. This permits the establishment of a steady-state bipolar microtubule spindle structure. Loss of Kinesin-5 function from the onset of mitosis in most eukaryotic organisms examined, including animals, plants, and fungi, results in catastrophic failure of mitosis. This motor‚Äôs function is crucial during the onset of mitosis, wherein its loss of function results in the collapse, or inversion, of the spindle poles leaving centrally positioned centrosome pairs flanked by a radial array of microtubules with peripheral condensed chromosomes. The one exception to this effect is mitosis within the nematode, C. elegans, in which Kinesin-5 is not strictly essential for mitosis, but nonetheless has considerable impact on the overall fidelity of cell division. The discovery of small chemical inhibitors of human Kinesin-5 through a pioneering in vitro phenotypic screening on cancer cell lines has led to both the development of new anticancer therapeutic agents, and to novel tools to probe the mechanism of microtubule motor proteins. This toolkit of allosteric inhibitors has been used to probe the specific role of Kinesin-5 in mitotic spindle assembly as well as fine dissection of motor domain function. Through this work it was found that, in mammalian cells, Kinesin-5 is required for the initial assembly of the mitotic spindle during prophase and prometaphase, but is dispensable to traverse subsequent anaphase during a round of mitosis. Also, the binding of the Kinesin-5 inhibitors to an allosteric site on the motor interrupts the mechanism by which this enzyme converts the chemical energy of ATP hydrolysis into the mechanical work of moving microtubules, thus providing insight on how this enzyme works. There are many models that attempt to explain the self- assembly of the mitotic spindle based upon microtubules as a structural element, and a set of microtubule motors, including Kinesin-5 to move and order them. Many of these models attempt to explain the steady state of the spindle at metaphase based on a predicted balance of motor forces acting in opposition within the spindle microtubules. Still, it is not clear whether all the structural elements required for spindle assembly are known, or how the motors, including Kinesin-5, might be regulated in space and time. Such caveats make assessment of such models difficult. Recent data, however, finds that aspects of the ‚Äòforce balance‚Äô model that posit spindle length and stability to be mediated by a balance between the minus-end directed microtubule sliding and plus-end directed microtubule sliding by opposing motors in insect cells, seems not to be the case in mammalian cells. The process of self-assembly of the mitotic spindle remains a major unsolved question in cell biology, and a robust model awaits further details of the regulation and behavior of various microtubule motors and structural elements that compose this machinery. Function in neurons Although Kinesin-5 is required in all cells during cell division, it does not appear to play a major role in the metabolism of most non-dividing cells. Among non-dividing cells, Kinesin-5 is most enriched within neurons, wherein it decorates the large microtubule bundles extending into axons and dendrites. It has been shown, for example, that neurons remain fully viable in the background of a knock-down of Kinesin-5, but that changes in neuronal development and morphogenesis ensue. In developing neurons pharmacological inhibition and siRNA knockdown of KIF11 results in longer axons, more branches, fewer bouts of axon retraction and the inability of growth cones to turn on contact with repulsive substrates. In migratory neurons, inhibition of KIF11 causes neurons to migrate in a random pattern and form shorter leading processes. KIF11, like KIF15 and KIF23, is thought to act as a restrictor of short microtubules moving bi-directionally along the axon, exerting forces antagonistically to cytoplasmic dynein. In mature neurons, KIF11 restricts the movement of short microtubules in dendrites, contributing to the formation of characteristic shape of dendrites. KIF11 is also expressed in adult dorsal root ganglion neurons, although at a much diminished level. In adult neurons It has a similar effect on inhibiting the rate of short microtubule transport so pharmacological inhibition and siRNA knockdown of adult KIF11 may be a potential therapeutic tool for the augmentation of adult axon regeneration. However, a clear in vivo role for Kinesin-5 in neurogenesis remains to be elucidated. Of note is that unusual peripheral neuropathies have not been observed in patients undergoing recent phase I or phase II trials of Kinesin-5 inhibitors for potential anti-cancer therapy. Functional regulation In 1995, Kinesin-5 was determined to be post-translationally phosphorylated within its C-terminal tail. Once Kinesin-5 is phosphorylated at this residue in early prophase, it localizes to the mitotic spindle where it binds to microtubules. An additional phosphosite was identified on the Kinesin-5 tail in 2008, however, only approximately 3% of the total microtubule-associated Kinesin-5 is phosphorylated at this residues. While additional phosphosites or other post-translational modifications within the Kinesin-5 tail, stalk, and motor have been identified, no other modifications have been proven as necessary for Kinesin-5 to perform its necessary tasks in mitosis. Kinesin-5 is also regulated through direct interaction with other proteins. The microtubule-associated protein, TPX2, associates with Kinesin-5 in mitosis. Their interaction is necessary for Kinesin-5 localization to the mitotic spindle, for stabilizing the spindle, and for spindle pole segregation. Kinesin-5 has been shown to interact with the dynactin subunit p150Glued as well as many other cell cycle related proteins in vivo and in vitro, however, additional experimentation is needed to confirm that their association is necessary for Kinesin-5 to function normally. Molecular mechanism ATP hydrolysis Kinesin-5, like all motor proteins, breaks down ATP into ADP and inorganic phosphate, using a water molecule, and converts the chemical energy to force and motion along microtubules. Kinetic experiments reveal rates of how fast intermediate steps in catalysis occur and the most extensive set of studies on Kinesin-5 kinetics has been on the human protein. X-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy, and real-time infrared spectroscopy have been used to measure the structure of Kinesin-5 in the different catalytic intermediate states. Changes in the secondary structure, or conformational switching, is required to convert and amplify biochemical changes in the catalytic active site into larger movements necessary for cellular motion. For example, the first step of ATP hydrolysis, which is the attack of the terminal phosphate of ATP by a water molecule, had not been observed by x-ray crystallography in any kinesin protein, until recently in Kinesin-5. This crystal structure showed that there was not one, but rather two, water molecules and they are in close association with each other. A two-water catalytic model was proposed and confirmed by an alternate method to track Kinesin-5 catalysis in real-time and in a kinesin protein in a different subfamily. Two-water catalytic models also are proposed in a divergent motor protein, myosin, and observed experimentally in one of its crystal structures. Mechanical Properties The antiparallel tetrameric organization of the Kinesin-5 family is fundamentally different from the majority of other kinesins that are dimers, such as the well-characterized conventional Kinesin-1 (KIF5B). Conventional kinesin dimerizes in such a manner that the catalytic (head) domains are together on one end of the complex to facilitate hand-over-hand movement along a microtubule that enables long-range, directed transport of cellular cargoes. The unique assembly of Kinesin-5 proteins not only organizes the protein complex for a different cellular function (antiparallel microtubule sliding, described above) but also made it difficult to study the mechanical properties of the motor using the classical experiments that were designed for dimeric kinesins. These obstacles have been overcome by either adapting the original experiments to analyze the tetrameric organization of Kinesin-5, or by working with shorter Kinesin-5 proteins that form dimers like conventional kinesin. The most striking outcomes of the analysis of Kinesin-5 motility is that it is slow ‚Äì about 10 times slower than conventional Kinesin-1 ‚Äì with a velocity in the range of 50 nanometers per second and that it could generate very high levels of mechanical force (7-9 picoNewtons per molecule). These values come from three types of experimental data: microtubule gliding assays, single molecule motility assays, and optical trap assays. In microtubule gliding assays, kinesins are attached to a glass surface and microtubules are laid down over the top. Since the motors are attached to the glass, their motile behavior translates into movement of the microtubule across the anchored kinesins, akin to someone crowd surfing. These experiments gave us the first analysis of Kinesin-5 motility.Microtubule gliding by Kinesin-5 By attaching microtubules to the glass surface first, then adding Kinesin-5 with free microtubules in solution, it was possible to adapt the microtubule gliding assays to show that Kinesin-5 can crosslink two microtubules and move them in opposite directions. This experiment showed that Kinesin-5 was indeed capable of carrying out the role that had been proposed for it in mitosis ‚Äì sliding oppositely oriented microtubules in the mitotic spindle. To study the behavior of individual Kinesin-5 molecules, single molecule motility assays were performed by attaching microtubules to a glass surface, then adding a dilute solution of Kinesin-5 with a fluorophore attached. This experimental setup enables the observer to follow separate Kinesin-5 molecules as they ‚Äúwalk‚Äù along the microtubule, providing not only information about velocity, but also about processivity ‚Äì the ability of a kinesin to take multiple steps along the microtubule without dissociating. Kinesin-5 in this setup has shown bi- directionality. Thus it can \\"walk\\" in both direction. The switching of direction is controlled with high precision. In single molecule motility assays, velocities for Kinesin-5 were similar to those seen in microtubule gliding assays, and the motor was observed to be weakly processive. In optical trap experiments, Kinesin-5 molecules are attached to a bead that can be held in place by a finely focused laser. By moving the bead close to a microtubule, the kinesin can bind to the microtubule and begin stepping, pulling the bead along behind it. Since the bead is being held in place by the trap laser, it acts like a spring and exerts a force that resists the forward movement of the kinesin. This allows for the measurement of the stall force ‚Äì the maximum amount of force that can be exerted by a motor before it releases from the microtubule. Optical trap experiments showed that Kinesin-5 generates a maximum of 7 picoNewtons of force before releasing, but that its behavior differs from that of other kinesins in that there was no observable plateau phase in which the motor ‚Äústruggles‚Äù at its maximal force generation before letting go. Extrapolation of kinetic data suggests that the maximal observed force generated in the optical trap by Kinesin-5 is actually an underestimate and that it theoretically can exert up to 9 picoNewtons of force as a maximum, although further experimental work is required to test this. Pharmacological inhibitors Inhibitors of KIF11 have been developed as chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of cancer. Drugs that specifically inhibit only human Kinesin-5 are alternatives to the taxanes and vinc alkaloids that target microtubules, and thus all cells, and that are currently used clinically. Inhibition of Kinesin-5 causes cells to undergo mitotic arrest, undergo apoptosis and form monoaster spindles. The first KIF11 inhibitor, monastrol was discovered in a chemical screen of a large library of cell permeable compounds. Since then, over 100 different chemical classes of allosteric inhibitors have been identified in the scientific literature and they have a wide range in potency against human Kinesin-5. Common KIF11 inhibitors include: * monastrol, * S-Trityl-L-cysteine (STLC), * HR22C16, and * CK0106023. The majority of human Kinesin-5 inhibitors are selective, because they bind to a drug ‚Äòhot spot‚Äô, composed of residues from the Œ±2 and Œ±3 helices and a flexible L5 loop on the surface of the motor domain. This L5 loop has high sequence variability amongst the Kinesin-5 orthologs and other kinesins within the superfamily. The L5 loop in human Kinesin-5 closes around the inhibitor and is open in the absence of inhibitor. These structural changes are correlated with other changes in the catalytic active site. Other sites of inhibitor binding have been identified in the human Kinesin-5 motor domain. For inhibitors that bind to the L5 pocket, the mechanism of inhibition is that they slow ADP release from the catalytic active site and inhibit ATP- dependent directional motion. However, a previously unknown diffusive motion by Kinesin-5 along microtubules was uncovered when monastrol inhibited the motor domain. Small-molecule inhibitors are not only important tools for understanding nanomotors in cells; they are also have potential for serving as tools in the clinic. Induced by human Kinesin-5 inhibitors, mitotic arrest results in apoptosis in some tumor cell lines and human tumor xenograft models. With these promising preclinical studies, ispinesib (SB-715992; Cytokinetics/GSK), SB-743921 from Cytokinetics/GSK, MK-0731 from Merck, filanesib (ARRY-520) (Array BioPharma), and litronesib (LY2523355) (Eli Lilly) have entered into clinical trials. Although second-generation Kinesin-5 inhibitors have had better success, none have been fully developed and marketed as an anti-cancer treatment. The role of specific residues in the L5 pocket (L5, Œ±2, and Œ±3) in human Kinesin-5 has been tested, but not yet been systematically explored. The initial goal of these mutation experiments was to determine which residues had greatest pharmacological importance in drug development. For example, mutations in the KIF11 gene convey resistance of mitotic cell lines to inhibitors such as monastrol and STLC. For example, point mutations in the inhibitor binding pocket, R119A, D130A, L132A, I136A, L214A and E215A confer resistance to monastrol, while R119A, D130A and L214A mutations confer resistance to STLC. In contrast to the loss-of-function experiments, a gain-of-function experiment using Drosophila Kinesin-5 showed that all L5-directed inhibitors do not allosterically communicate in the same way within the Kinesin-5 motor domain. A second purpose of mutational studies is to understand how drug resistance in cells is conferred from only changing one residue. These changes in the inhibitor-binding pocket are correlated with structural modification, or twist, of the central beta-sheet of the Kinesin-5 motor domain. In this manner, the L5 loop may be able to directly control nucleotide binding and beta-sheet twist can manipulate the adjacent microtubule-binding site. This may explain how tumor cells rapidly can become drug-resistant to KIF11 inhibitors. Human mutations KIF11 mutations have been widely described in cancer, and many trials with KIF11 inhibitors are ongoing. Clinical significance Germline mutations in KIF11 cause Microcephaly with or without chorioretinopathy, lymphedema, or mental retardation (MCLMR). This syndrome is observed as an autosomal dominant disorder with variable expressivity but can also be sporadic. It is characterized by mild-to-severe microcephaly, often associated with developmental delay, ocular defects and lymphedema, usually on the dorsum of the feet. Phenotypic evaluation of patients (n = 87) revealed microcephaly in 91%, eye anomalies in 72%, intellectual disability in 67% and lymphedema in 47% of the patients. Unaffected carriers were rare (4 out of 87: 5%). Family history is not a requisite for diagnosis; 31% (16 out of 52) were de novo cases. All inherited cases, and 50% of sporadic cases of MCLMR are due to germline KIF11 mutations.

This enzyme, found in both the cytosol and peroxisomes, binds to specific epoxides and converts them to the corresponding diols. A different region of this protein also has lipid-phosphate phosphatase activity. Mutations in the EPHX2 gene have been associated with familial hypercholesterolemia.  Tissue distribution  While most highly expressed in the liver, sEH is also expressed in other tissues including vascular endothelium, leukocytes, red blood cells, smooth muscle cells, adipocytes and the kidney proximal tubule. In the human brain, the enzyme is distributed widely, mostly in neuronal cell bodies, as well as in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes .  Catalyzed reactions  Reactions catalyzed by soluble epoxide hydrolase The form of sEH in the intracellular environment is a homodimer with two distinct activities in two separate structural domains of each monomer: the C-terminal epoxide hydrolase activity (soluble epoxide hydrolase: EC 3.3.2.10) and the N-terminal phosphatase activity (lipid-phosphate phosphatase: EC 3.1.3.76). sEH converts epoxides, or three membered cyclic ethers, to their corresponding diols through the addition of a molecule of water. The resulting diols are more water-soluble than the parent epoxides, and so are more readily excreted by the organism. The C-term-EH catalyzes the addition of water to an epoxide to yield a vicinal diol (reaction 1). The Nterm-phos hydrolyzes phosphate monoesters, such as lipid phosphates, to yield alcohols and phosphoric acid (reaction 2). The C-term-EH hydrolyzes one important class of lipid signaling molecules that includes many epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) that have vasoactive, anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. sEH also appears to be the hepoxilin hydrolase that is responsible for inactivating the epoxyalcohol metabolites of arachidonic acid, hepoxilin A3 and hepoxiin B3.  Discovery  The sEH was first identified in the cytosolic fraction of mouse liver through its activity on epoxide containing substrates such as juvenile hormone and lipid epoxides such as epoxystearate. The soluble EH activity was shown to be distinct from that of the microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH) previously discovered with a different substrate selectivity and cellular localization than the mEH. Studies using a lipid epoxide as a substrate detected this activity in the soluble fraction of multiple organs, though at a lesser amount than in liver and kidney. The enzyme activity was detected in rabbits, mice and rats, and humans, and it is now believed to be ubiquitous in vertebrates. The proposed enzyme was first named cytosolic epoxide hydrolase; however, after its discovery inside the peroxisomes of some organs, it was renamed soluble epoxide hydrolase or sEH.  Function  sEH has a restricted substrate selectivity, and has not been shown to hydrolyze any toxic or mutagenic xenobiotics. Conversely, the sEH plays a major role in the in vivo metabolism of endogenous lipid epoxides, such as the EETs and squalene oxide, a key intermediate in the synthesis of cholesterol. EETs are lipid signaling molecules that function in an autocrine and paracrine manner. They are produced when arachidonic acid is metabolized by cytochrome p450s (CYPs). These enzymes epoxidize the double bonds in arachidonic acid to form four regioisomers. Arachidonic acid is also the precursor of the prostaglandins and the leukotrienes, which are produced by cyclooxygenases and lipoxygenases, respectively. These lipids play a role in asthma, pain, and inflammation and are the targets of several pharmaceuticals. The EET receptor or receptors have not been identified, but several tools for the study of EET biology have been developed, these include small molecule sEH inhibitors, EET mimics and sEH genetic models. Through the use of these tools, as well as the EETs themselves, the EETs have been found to have anti-inflammatory and vasoactive properties. Several disease models have been used, including Ang-II induced hypertension and surgical models of brain and heart ischemia. In vitro models such as isolated coronary rings and platelet aggregation assays have also been employed. The proposed role of sEH in the regulation of hypertension can be used as a simple model of sEH function in the kidney. Here the EETs are vasodilatory, and can be thought of as balancing other vasoconstrictive signals. sEH hydrolyzes the EETs to form the dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs). These molecules are more water-soluble and are more easily metabolized by other enzymes, so the vasodilatory signal is removed from the site of action through excretion, tipping the balance of vasoconstrictive and vasodilatory signals towards vasoconstriction. This change in the lipid signaling increases vascular resistance to blood flow and blood pressure. By reducing sEH epoxide hydrolase activity, and thereby shutting off the major route of metabolism of the EETs, the levels of these molecules can be stabilized or increased, increasing blood flow and reducing hypertension. This reduction in sEH activity can be achieved in genetic models in which sEH has been knocked out, or through the use of small molecule sEH inhibitors. This simplified model is complicated by a number of factors in vivo. The EETs display different properties in different vascular beds. The DHETs are more readily excreted, but they have yet to be fully characterized, and may possess biological properties themselves, complicating the balance of signals described in the simplified model. There are epoxides of other lipids besides arachidonic acid such as the omega three docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) epoxides. These lipid epoxides have been shown to have biological effects in vitro in which they inhibit platelet aggregation. In fact, in some assays they are more potent than the EETs. Other epoxidized lipids include the 18-carbon leukotoxin and isoleukotoxin. The diepoxide of linoleic acid can form tetrahydrofuran diols, sEH metabolizes the biologically active epoxyalcohol metabolites of arachidnoic acid, hepoxilin A3 (8-hydroxy-11S,12Sepoxy-(5Z,8Z,14Z)-eicosatrienoic acid) to trioxilin A3 (8,11,12-trihydroxy-(5Z,9E,14Z)-eicosatrienoic acid) and hepoxilin B3 (10-hydroxy-11S,12Sepoxy-(5Z,9E,14Z)-eicosatrienoic acid) to trioxlin B3 (10,11,12-trihydroxy-(5Z,9E,14Z)-eicosatrienoic acid. These trihydroxy products are generally considered to be inactive and the sEH pathway is generally considered to limit the actions of the hepoxilins. The phosphatase activity of sEH has been shown to hydrolyze in vitro lipid phosphates such as terpene pyrophosphates or lysophosphatidic acids. Studies suggest a potential role of sEH in regulating cholesterol biosynthesis and metabolism in the brain. If the N-terminal domain of sEH is regulating cholesterol metabolism, it emplies that higher levels of its phosphatase activity could potentially increase brain cholesterol concentrations . However, its biological role is still unknown.  Clinical significance  Through metabolism of EETs and other lipid mediators, sEH plays a role in several diseases, including hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy, arteriosclerosis, brain and heart ischemia/reperfusion injury, cancer and pain. Because of its possible role in cardiovascular and other diseases, sEH is being pursued as a pharmacological target, and potent small molecule inhibitors are available. Because of the implications to human health, sEH has been pursued as a pharmaceutical target and several sEH inhibitors have been developed in the private and public sectors. One such inhibitor, UC1153 (AR9281), was taken to a phase IIA clinal trial for treatment of hypertension by Ar√™te Therapeutics. However, UC1153 failed the clinical trial, due in large part because of its poor pharmacokinetic properties. Since this trial, a different sEH inhibitor, GSK2256294, developed for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by GlaxoSmithKline has entered the pre-recruiting phase of a phase I clinical trial for obese male smokers. EicOsis designs and applies sEH inhibitors towards treating chronic pain in humans, companion animals and horses. The inhibitor EC1728 has been shown to successfully treat equine laminitis and alleviate inflammatory pain in dogs and cats and is currently undergoing clinical trials in horses. The sEH inhibitor EC5026 has been selected as the therapeutic for diabetic neuropathy and recently entered Phase 1 clinical trials. Thus, interest continues in sEH as a therapeutic target. Another drug described as a small-molecule thrombolytic with multiple mechanisms of action, SMTP-7, has been found to act as a sEH inhibitor, but is still at early experimental stages. One indication of the possible therapeutic value of sEH inhibition comes from studies examining physiologically relevant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of sEH in human populations. The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) and the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) studies both associated SNPs in the sEH coding region with coronary heart disease. In these studies, two nonsynonymous SNPs were identified, R287Q and K55R. R287Q changes the arginine in position 287 in the most frequent allele to glutamine, while K55R changes the lysine in position 55 to an arginine. R287Q was associated with coronary artery calcification in African American population participating in the CARDIA study. The K55R allele is associated with the risk of developing coronary heart disease in Caucasians participating in the ARIC study, where it was also associated with a higher risk of hypertension and ischemic stroke in male homozygotes.

Bruce Ozella (born November 10, 1958) is an American cartoonist, best known for his revival of Popeye in 2012. After study at Boston's New England School of Art & Design, Ozella worked as a graphic designer and illustrator in Boston for more than 30 years, producing advertising concepts, brochures, cartoons, flyers, magazine and newspaper ads, pamphlets, posters, programs and public relations materials. Comic books In 2011-12, for IDW, writer-artist Roger Langridge scripted a four-issue Popeye miniseries, with Ozella illustrating issues #1 and #4. Shaun Manning, writing for Comic Book Resources, noted: :Langridge is working with newcomer artist Bruce Ozella for the series, an artist whose appeal once again rests in evoking the classic Popeye strips of yore. Asked what Ozella's style brings to a series like Popeye, Langridge said simply, \\"You mean apart from his uncanny ability to draw like E. C. Segar? I'm not sure you need anything else!\\"Manning, Shaun. \\"Roger Langridge Scraps with Popeye\\". Comic Book Resources, January 18, 2012.

The Popeye miniseries, co-edited by IDW founder Ted Adams and designer Craig Yoe, was launched in April 2012. Critic PS Hayes commented: :Langridge writes a story with a lot of dialogue (compared to your average comic book) and it's all necessary, funny, and entertaining. Bruce Ozella draws the perfect Popeye. Not only Popeye, but Popeye's whole world. Everything looks like it should, cartoony and goofy. Plus, he brings an unusual amount of detail to something that doesn‚Äôt really need it. You'll swear that you're looking at an old Whitman Comics issue of Popeye, only it‚Äôs better. Ozella is a great storyteller and even though the issue is jam packed with dialog, the panels never look cramped at all.\\"Review: Popeye #1\\", Geeks of Doom, April 25, 2012.

It‚Äôs exactly in Segar's style, with the rounded heads, wiggly lines radiating out of people‚Äôs heads, and gruff expressions. Bluto just radiates menace, and his assistant looks like a huge slab of beef just ready to attack. He‚Äôs got a fun sense of motion for his characters, with Popeye's arms whirling around like a windmill, or the way that he leaps and bounds through the air.

The film focuses on the extraordinary human-animal bond between Circus Flora founder, Ivor David Balding, and Flora an endangered African elephant, and their journey to find her a permanent home that leads them to The Elephant Sanctuary (Hohenwald). The film provides insightful research footage to further discussion of the human-animal bond as part of anthrozoology (human‚Äìanimal studies), a new academic field that examines the relationships between non-human and human animals. Synopsis Where does an elephant go after a life in the circus? Sixteen years have passed since circus producer Ivor David Balding adopted Flora, the orphaned baby African elephant he lovingly raised as part of his family and made the star of his show. As Flora approaches adulthood, he realizes that she is not happy performing. Ultimately, David must face the difficult truth that the circus is no place for Flora. She needs to be with other elephants. The road to Flora‚Äôs retirement, however, is a difficult and emotional journey which tests their bond in unexpected ways. Ten years in the making, One Lucky Elephant explores the consequences of keeping wild animals in captivity, while never losing sight of the delicate love story at its heart.

The Derby Day is a large oil painting showing a panoramic view of The Derby, painted by William Powell Frith over 15 months from 1856 to 1858. It has been described by Christie's as Frith's \\"undisputed masterpiece\\" and also \\"arguably the definitive example of Victorian modern-life genre\\". William Powell Frith, R.A., (1819‚Äì1909) The Derby Day: the 'first study' for the celebrated painting. Christies, 2013. Retrieved 19 April 2013. Partially archived here. The original version is in Tate Britain in London. As with many of Frith's works, he painted a second version many years later, which is now in the Manchester Art Gallery. A much smaller but well-finished oil study was sold in 2011. The painting The painting measures by and gives a satirical view of Victorian society. It includes three main scenes, during the annual spectacle of the Derby, when large numbers of Londoners left town for the day to visit the races on Epsom Downs Racecourse, presenting a cross-section of society in a contemporary saturnalian revel. Earlier pictures of the Derby crowds were drawn by illustrators such as John Leech or Dickie Doyle. On the left, near the private tent of the Reform Club, rich city gentlemen in top hats surround the table of a thimble-rigger who is busy cheating them out of their money. To the right, one stands with his hands in his empty pockets, and shirt gaping, having gambled away his pocketwatch, its curb chain and his shirt-studs. In Frith's 1895, My Autobiography and Reminiscences, the painter- turned-memorialist leaves a charming account of his encounter with a thimble- rig team (operator and accomplices): > \\"My first visit to Epsom was in the May of 1856 ‚Äî Blink Bonnie's year. My > first Derby had no interest for me as a race, but as giving me the > opportunity of studying life and character it is ever to be gratefully > remembered. Gambling-tents and thimble-rigging, prick in the garter and the > three-card trick, had not then been stopped by the police. So convinced was > I that I could find the pea under the thimble that I was on the point of > backing my guess rather heavily, when I was stopped by Egg [Frith‚Äôs > companion], whose interference was resented by a clerical-looking personage, > in language much opposed to what would have been anticipated from one of his > cloth. 'You,' said Egg, addressing the divine, 'you are a confederate, you > know; my friend is not to be taken in.' 'Look here,' said the clergyman, > 'don't you call names, and don't call me names, or I shall knock your d ‚Äî d > head off.' 'Will you?' said Egg, his courage rising as he saw two policemen > approaching. 'Then I call the lot of you ‚Äî the Quaker there, no more a > Quaker than I am, and that fellow that thinks he looks like a farmer ‚Äî you > are a parcel of thieves!' 'So they are, sir,' said a meek-looking lad who > joined us; 'they have cleaned me out.' 'Now move off; clear out of this!' > said the police; and the gang walked away, the clergyman turning and > extending his arms in the act of blessing me and Egg.\\" Further left, a young country man in smock is being held back by his woman to prevent him from joining in. In the centre, an acrobat is ready to perform with his son, but the attention of the thin young boy has been distracted by a lavish picnic banquet that is being laid out. Spectators throng behind, drinking champagne in their carriages, with the racecourse grandstand visible in the background. At the far right, a well-dressed man leans against the carriage of his young mistress. Echoing her position, a high class prostitute in brown riding clothes is on the extreme left, one of many seen that could be seen each day riding in Hyde Park. To the right, a thief can be seen stealing a gold watch from a man with his hands in his pockets. Also visible are a group of musicians, and a group of beggars, and street vendors selling their wares. Detail from the Manchester version (lower right corner) The Royal Academician John Evan Hodgson noted: Research by Dr Mary Cowling indicates that Frith depicted individuals from nearly one hundred distinct social types from the finely graduated class system in Victorian England, each distinguished by its particular clothing and physical appearance. Frith believed in physiognomy, so each individual bears the features thought to be typical of his or her social position and character. Background Life at the Seaside (also known as Ramsgate Sands) After the success of his earlier work, Life at the Seaside (also known as Ramsgate Sands), Frith was keen to find another contemporary piece. He visited Epsom in May 1856 with Augustus Egg and made an initial sketch. Frith was commissioned to paint a five- or six-foot canvas by the chemist Jacob Bell, for a fee of ¬£1,500. He also sold the right to sell copies of the painting, and one of his studies, to art dealer Ernest Gambart for another ¬£1,500. The work took nearly two years to complete, with different arrangements tried out on two large sketches and a further visit to the racecourse before the large work was completed. Frith used many live models for the painted figures, but also drew inspiration from photographs of Epsom racecourse and of groups of people. He hired an acrobat and his son from a pantomime in Drury Lane, and a jockey named Bundy, and commissioned Robert Howlett to take photographs of unusual groups of people. The 1896 edition of the boys' annual Chums includes an anecdote (page 117) about the boy acrobat who sat as a model for Frith: \\"This youth had a kind of idea that sitting meant turning head over heels; and every now and then Mr. Frith had to stop him from actually turning a somersault among his casts and drapery.\\" The Chums article also relates how the young boy was impressed with the lavatory in Frith's house, exclaiming to his father: \\"Oh, father, such a beautiful place ‚Äì all mahoginy (sic) and a chany (sic) basin to wash in.\\" Reception The painting was first exhibited at the Royal Academy exhibition in 1858, where it became so popular that a rail was needed to protect it from the thronging crowds (only the second time that a rail was installed at the Royal Academy exhibition: the first was in 1822 for David Wilkie's The Chelsea Pensioners reading the Waterloo Dispatch). The painting was bequeathed to the National Gallery by Jacob Bell in 1859 and but later transferred to the Tate Gallery. Frith was commissioned to paint a second version for James Gresham of Stretford in 1893-94, which has been held by Manchester Art Gallery since 1896.

Background and career  Metzler was born in Milwaukee County on February 18, 1864, and received his education in public schools. He worked in the auditing department of the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railway from 1883 to 1890; from 1891 to 1894 held a similar position with the Milwaukee, Lake Shore and Western Railway, and from 1896 to 1903 worked as an independent bookkeeper.

In the fall general election of that year, however, he was elected to the Assembly, with 1,411 votes to 1,209 for Socialist Jacob Hunger and 627 for Democrat William Biesel, succeeding fellow Republican George Rankl.

The company opened its first restaurant in West Midtown, Atlanta in 2008, and has since opened three additional locations, one in the Buckhead area of Atlanta, one in Birmingham, Alabama, and one in Nashville, Tennessee. The restaurant has been generally well- received by food critics for its ambiance and food, though there has been criticism that the restaurant is \\"overdone\\". It has been credited as increasing competition among hamburger restaurants in Atlanta. History Richard Blais collaborated with Barry Mills in creating FLIP burger boutique's menu. Barry Mills conceived the restaurant's concept as wanting to expand the definition of a what he thought was a hamburger. He sought inspiration from the new growth of hamburger eateries in Los Angeles and New York City, yet disliked their approaches, thinking it would hinder innovation‚Äîbeing bound to a traditional diner-style burger. FLIP opened an outlet at The Summit in Birmingham, Alabama on December 19, 2010. Ron Stewart, one of the owners of the first Atlanta franchise, was born and raised in Birmingham. The company then opened an outlet on October 19, 2010 in Buckhead, Atlanta, at the Tuxedo Festival Shopping Center. Mills used architecture firm ai3 to design the interior of the restaurants. The chain hoped to open a location in Washington, D.C. in the Penn Quarter in early 2010, but was unable to negotiate a lease. New York City and Miami have also been noted as potential sites for new outlets. Mills has stated that although its prices would rise, the chain should be able to expand throughout the United States. Critical reception FLIP burger boutique has been generally well-received by food critics. For example, Food & Wine journalist Dana Cowin wrote that \\"Richard Blais's 'burger boutique' is mod, ambitious and delicious.\\" Wine & Spirits writer Krista Reese praised the pricing of the menu and its unique ingredients. And The Atlanta Journal-Constitution described the menu as \\"fun\\", allowing Blais to \\"play with the whimsical goofiness that makes him, well, him.\\" ' The architecture and the atmosphere of the chain's restaurants have also been lauded. However, there are also negative reviews. Creative Loafing in December 2010 called the food at FLIP's Buckhead location \\"overly salty, overly sweet, overly complicated, overcooked, overfried and just overdone,\\" with \\"fried sides that tasted of leadened fried bread\\". Critic Jennifer Zyman noted: \\"each burger tastes as if someone said, 'Dude, let's figure out a way to cram a bunch of crap on one plate so the diner can't identify a single ingredient.'\\" Furthermore the newspaper remarked that the decor, as a \\"carbon copy\\" of the original Westside location, \\"except slightly larger,\\" was \\"somehow less cool as a result.\\" In the same month, Christian Lauterback in Knife & Fork called the Buckhead location \\"silly and expensive.\\" Lauterbach characterized FLIP's approach as \\"heaping on garnishes and condiments and finishing everything with sugar\\" to ensure that patrons \\"can't taste anything.\\" She also criticized a \\"stupefyingly bad\\" osso bucco burger with marrow-naise and gremolata.Knife & Fork in Oxford American magazine, quoted by Cliff Bostock in \\"Christiane fries Flip, praises Cafe Q and Sufi's\\", Creative Loafing, December 30, 2010 See also * List of hamburger restaurants References External links * Official website Category:Regional restaurant chains in the United States Category:Restaurants in Birmingham, Alabama Category:Restaurants in Atlanta Category:Restaurants in Nashville, Tennessee Category:Restaurants established in 2008 Category:2008 establishments in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Hamburger restaurants ","title":"FLIP Burger Boutique"},{"id":"34520813","text":"Anatrachyntis lunulifera is a moth in the family Cosmopterigidae.

K. Skvortsov rather than a species itself. William Hooker, 1840. This willow is a branching shrub which forms dense thickets that grow to about tall, but is known to reach . Along with S. pulchra and S. alaxensis, it is the tallest willow in the Arctic Archipelago.G.W. Argus, C.L. McJannet and M.J. Dallwitz (1999 onwards). Salix richardsonii. Salicaceae of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago: Descriptions, Illustrations, Identification, and Information Retrieval. Version: 2 November 2000. The stems of this species have smooth, hairless bark, but the young twigs are very hairy. The wood becomes brittle as it ages. This species is dioecious, with male and female reproductive structures on separate individuals. The inflorescence is a catkin. The catkins appear before the leaves in the spring. The flowers of S. richardsonii are typically pollinated by bees. The seeds are viable for only a short period of time and germinate immediately upon contact with the moist substrate. Natural hybrids can be formed with other willows, such as S. barclayi and S. calcicola, with the hybrid Salix calcicola √ó S. richardsonii reportedly found on Southampton Island. This common willow can be found growing along streams and in other moist areas in the Arctic and above the timberline. It also grows in spruce forests and woodlands and areas that have recently burned. It grows on floodplains and other habitats that flood periodically. It grows on pingos and the open tundra. This species stabilizes eroding streambanks, and it can easily colonize disturbed areas and bare sites where debris has been cleared. It is fire-tolerant, resprouting easily after much of its aboveground mass has been burned. This plant provides food for many animals, such as moose, caribou, and beavers. The thickets provide cover, and beavers use the branches to build their dams. Thickets of the plant on streambanks allow the water to undercut the bank, providing overhangs for fish to hide under. Native Americans used parts of willows, including this species, for medicinal purposes, basket weaving, to make weapons such as bows and arrows, and for building animal traps. The bark was boiled to make broth, which was used to treat sore throats and tuberculosis (see Salicylic acid).

After winning 95.3 MHz in 1998 December, the Auto Club hired staff and built up a studio. Broadcast started in April 1999. Oszk√°r Heged≈±s, president of the HAC, was the first to speak on the air. This made the Hungarian Auto Club the first of the European auto clubs broadcasting 24 hours a day. After some two years on the air, the leadership of the HAC decided to sell the company for undisclosed reasons. HAC raised the equity of Klubr√°di√≥ by 145 million forints and immediately sold 100 million forints worth of shares to Monogr√°f Rt. in October 2001, not long before the 2002 elections in Hungary.Klubr√°di√≥ ‚Äì ismert √ºzletemberek vett√©k √°t ‚Äì Kreat√≠v, 2001. okt√≥ber 31. Monogr√°f Rt. was founded in 2001 September, one month prior to gaining controlling stake in Klubr√°di√≥. The headquarters of Monogr√°f was in the same building as the publisher of the left-wing weekly 168 √≥ra. Monogr√°f, whose ownership at that time had close ties to the SZDSZ party, acquired Klubr√°di√≥ from the Hungarian Auto Club, even though other bidders offered more. In the second half of 2002, the consortium gained 100% ownership in Klubr√°di√≥. With this change, the original Klubr√°di√≥ owned by the actual Aut√≥ Klub (HAC), together with the traffic radio format in Hungary, disappeared after having the approval of the media authority (ORTT). Only the name and frequency remained whereas the format and the programs offered were completely changed. This way the program structure of the station became completely different from the one presented and approved in the 1998 tender. However, since Auto Klub offered many public service broadcasts in the tender, such as frequent traffic news, the license fee for the station was considerably less than that of a commercial radio. The ORTT in 2001 approved the change, enabling the new opinion and news profile of Klubr√°di√≥. The Orb√°n- government's delegates had the minority in ORTT at the time. Since the departements are staffed based on the election mandates and Fidesz - KDNP holds 67% of the parliamentary majority, it is not surprising that all state departements, including the ORTT had Fidesz - KDNP majority in 2011. The licence awarded for the frequency had a duration of twelve years and expired in February 2011. 1998‚Äì2010: Decade of Independence Klubr√°di√≥ had its first broadcast with the new format on December 10, 2001. Klubr√°di√≥ provides a live internet broadcast on its website 24 hours a day. Many programs are also downloadable in mp3 format. In 2007 Klubr√°di√≥ have attempted to perform a live broadcast from Debrecen, but protesters demonstrating against the allegedly biased coverage of Klubr√°di√≥ have caused the station to interrupt its programming. Lajos K√≥sa, the mayor of Debrecen condemned the ‚Äûextreme opinions‚Äù of both the demonstrators and of Klubr√°di√≥.N√©pszabadsag K√≥sa: a Klubr√°di√≥ √©s az ellene t√ºntet≈ëk egyar√°nt a sz√©ls≈ës√©get k√©pviselik 2007. j√∫nius 29. In 2009 there was a tender in which Danubius and Slager radio owned by UK and US companies respectively, have participated. The ORTT at the time, dominated by MSZP and SZDSZ members awarded the frequency to two startups, dislodging the previous owners. Klubr√°di√≥ (a staunch supporter of both MSZP and SZDSZ) have supported that decision. An anchor of the station, Gy√∂rgy Bolg√°r have said on Klubr√°di√≥ that, the company who is willing to pay the most amount of money for a frequency should be proclaimed the winner.Bolg√°r Gy√∂rgy: Aki a legt√∂bbet aj√°nlja, az√© a frekvencia Gy√∂rgy Bolgar's words on the issue of Danubius and Slager However, it turned out to be later that the cited sentence was cut out of its context. In 2005, Socialist Prime Minister, Ferenc Gyurcs√°ny took on the role of host in Klubr√°di√≥. PM Gyurcs√°ny anchored the 500th edition of Kontra, one of Klubr√°di√≥'s prime-time shows hosted by J√≥zsef Orosz.Gyurcs√°ny Ferenc mƒ¶sorvezet≈ë lesz Apart from PM Gyurcs√°ny, other well- known personalities hosted the show, for example Istv√°n Szab√≥ Academy Awarded director and Ibolya D√°vid, then-president of MDF. Anchorman Mr. Orosz also invited President Mr. Orb√°n of Fidesz, but he did not even respond. In 2010, Ferenc Vicsek became the editor-in-chief for Klubr√°di√≥, saying he will introduce a few non political programs as well.Kir√∫gt√°k a Klubr√°di√≥ f≈ëszerkeszt≈ëj√©t ‚Äì Index, 2010. j√∫nius 2. In 2007 G√°bor Rudas, and √Åkos Ablonczy, both in management positions, left Klubr√°di√≥. The press cited stagnant listenership as the reason of their departure.Lel√©ptek a f≈ën√∂k√∂k a Klubr√°di√≥t√≥l Andr√°s Arat√≥ gained more and more control in the company after that point. Today, he is considered to be both the owner and the manager of Klubr√°di√≥. Klubr√°di√≥ often uses unidentified callers in some of its programming for saving their anonymity on call-in programs. In addition, callers always have the right to reveal their identity. A case became controversial after an unidentified caller falsely accused the Kruchina brothers of various violent acts allegedly committed on 2007 March 15, when they were in Germany.Bolg√°r √∫r √©s a megvil√°g√≠t√°s The claims of the caller were repeated multiple times on Klubr√°di√≥ but when a reporter for index.hu, Tam√°s Bodoky have asked Bolg√°r for the contact information of the caller, Bolg√°r refused. The Kruchinas, with the help of Bodoky, then turned to ORTT, the data ombudsman, Attila P√©terfalvi, and sued Klubr√°di√≥ in court. Klubr√°di√≥ and the unidentified caller finally had to pay damages exceeding two million forints for libel.Joger≈ës: pert nyertek a Kruchina testv√©rek a Klubr√°di√≥val szemben In connection with the case it was alleged that Klubr√°di√≥ uses organized callerspert nyertek a Kruchina testv√©rek a Klubr√°di√≥val szemben to make various questionable statements, which would lead to larger legal exposure if said by a radio host. 2010--2013: Battle for Independence and Broadcast License Points achieved in the tender for 95,3 MHz, Klubr√°di√≥ received the fewest points on the so-called objective criteria and it could not overcome this disadvantage, even though it received maximal points in subjective categories, which were subject to The parliamentary elections of 2010 caused a serious impact on the run of Klubr√°di√≥. The commercial station lost its financial integrity because many companies and agencies stopped advertising in Klubr√°di√≥ for fearing of political consequences, and it almost went bankruptcy. After the victory of the right-wing party Fidesz securing the 2/3 majority in Parliament, Klubr√°di√≥ became the number one enemy in the eye of the ruling party. In addition, in February, 2011, the broadcast license of Klubr√°di√≥ expired but it continued broadcasting anyway due to temporary licenses, which were granted on a regular basis. Three tenders for three Budapest frequencies were advertised in mid-2011 with identical terms and conditions. Klubr√°di√≥ have only submitted a tender offer for one of them, without providing a reason as to why it did not consider the others viable. The tender was preceded by intense lobbying for Klubr√°di√≥; various pressure groups tried to ensure that tender invitation is construed in such a way that only Klubr√°di√≥ could win.Klubr√°di√≥ case Klubr√°di√≥ had issued several suggestions in open hearings before the tender was finalized. First, Klubr√°di√≥ suggested that the frequency should be based on the premise of public service frequency, where the license fee might be zero forints. If the frequency were to be a commercial frequency, Klubr√°di√≥ have suggested a license fee of 6 million forints. A Klubr√°di√≥ √ºgy√©ben tudatos politikai provok√°ci√≥ folyik During the actual tender, Klubr√°di√≥ itself have offered to pay 55 million forints for the frequency, almost ten times of its original suggestion. This resulted in claims that the original Klubr√°di√≥ suggestions were provocative.Klubr√°di√≥, a case of pre-meditated political provocation However, according to the tender, the would-be winner of 95,3 MHz should be broadcasting mainly music and local news that implied the possible loss of Klubr√°di√≥ knowing a talk and news station would not have a chance to be in accordance with the new premises. After closing the tender, Autor√°di√≥ gained first place for 95,3 MHz with 66 points, because Klubr√°di√≥ refused to bid for the other two frequencies with identical terms, this raised the possibility of losing a Budapest frequency.Elvesz√≠tette f≈ëv√°rosi frekvenci√°j√°t a Klubr√°di√≥ ‚Äì Origo, 2011. december 20. Klubr√°di√≥ came in second with 65 points, the pressure intensified to achieve overturning the decision. In Hungary, all tender decisions are subject to legal review, and when the management of Klubr√°di√≥ launched a suit for the frequency, a court case began. Klubr√°di√≥ did not argue that they should have received more points, rather they claimed that the winner's offer was ‚Äûunrealistic‚Äù and should have been disqualified. Klubr√°di√≥ added that they judged all bids over 53 million were ‚Äûunrealistic‚Äù.‚Äù√°ll√°spontjuk szerint m√°r a p√°ly√°zati felh√≠v√°sban szerepl≈ë koncesszi√≥s d√≠j nagys√°grendje, az √©vi minimum 53 milli√≥ forint meghat√°roz√°sa is irre√°lis volt. ‚ÄûVisszat√°madt a Klubr√°di√≥ The argument would also disqualify Klubr√°di√≥'s own bid of 55 million forints of yearly broadcasting fee. While the court case was still in progress, there were reports of more outside pressure trying to ensure Klubr√°di√≥'s gain of the frequency. Klubr√°di√≥ and the mainstream media also attacked the winners of the tender Autoradio for being a startup company without relevant experience in broadcasting, founded in early 2011, even though Monogr√°f Rt, the owner of Klubr√°di√≥ was just a month older at the time it acquired Klubr√°di√≥. Klubr√°di√≥ offered near the minimum amount at the 2011 tender for the 95,3Mhz frequency, only 4% more than the absolute minimum, the low monetary offer was the largest contribution to Klubr√°di√≥'s Failure Since the results of the other tenders (invited with identical terms and conditions as 95.3Mhz) were not attacked in court, the winner, Juventus radio was given the green light to start broadcasting on the 1st of February on 103,9 MHz. Juventus has to pay a yearly license fee of 52 million forints for using that frequency.A R√°di√≥1 hely√©n sz√≥lhat a Juventus R√°di√≥ Klubr√°di√≥ submitted only a bid for a single one of three identical tenders, raising concerns that it was just a try in order to lose the bidding on purpose. Klubr√°di√≥'s financial offer was also inferior to other tender participants, as well as conditions offered. After the results of Klubr√°di√≥'s second place were announced, an intense media campaign was immediately launched by Klubr√°di√≥. According to The New York Times, \\"The clash has become emblematic of what critics call a bald attempt by the Orb√°n government to tighten its grip on the news media, the judiciary, the central bank and education, and the inability of the European Union, which Hungary joined in 2004, to restrain a government not cleaving to the bloc‚Äôs democratic standards.\\" (March 19, 2013) For two years, Hungary's news media council, which hands out radio frequencies and is stacked with Mr. Orb√°n's supporters, refused to renew Klubr√°di√≥'s long-term frequency, despite three court rulings in the station's favor. Instead, it initially awarded Klubr√°di√≥'s frequency to an unknown broadcaster that then mysteriously disappeared. Klubr√°di√≥ has been still operating and on the air every day on the Budapest frequency as of January 2012, and the station owns several other frequencies countryside. The court case launched by Klubr√°di√≥ had the effect of slowing the transition down because Autoradio cannot sign the broadcast contract until the case has been resolved. Until then, Klubr√°di√≥ can broadcast upon temporary licenses (because its original frequency expired in 2011 February) In advertisements aired on Klubr√°di√≥, the station said that it would continue broadcasting on the internet and other frequencies if it lose the Budapest frequency. Experiencing the political pressure and administrative measures against Klubr√°di√≥, even Secretary Hillary Clinton of the US found it important to identify Klubr√°di√≥ with the freedom of press in Hungary, and the corresponding authorities of the EU condemned the actions against Klubr√°di√≥ directed by the ruling right-wing party. Hungary's democratic regression is also causing alarm within the European Union and EU member states. The country's parliament recently passed constitutional amendments limiting the powers of the constitutional court in a move which observers believe will undermine democratic checks and balances, and enhance the authoritarian drift under Orb√°n. If Klubr√°di√≥ had offered HUF 8 millionA little more than US$ 35,000 more per year, it would have won the 95,3 frequency. Klubr√°di√≥ previously had to collect more than HUF 120 million from donations through a fundraising campaign in order to maintain its running; at the same time, advertisers either withdrew or refused putting ads on a so- called liberal Klubr√°di√≥ for fearing of the political consequences that were apparent after the latest elections. Meanwhile, Klubr√°di√≥ lost its frequencies and licenses in countryside.Ha a Klubr√°di√≥ 8 milli√≥val t√∂bbet aj√°nl, elnyeri a frekvenci√°t If Autoradio cannot pay the amount it offered to pay, or the signing of the contract with this company fails for any reason, the frequency will go to the second placed participant, Klubr√°di√≥. After press attacks on Autoradio, the winner of the tender intensified, the firm announced a plan to a sell the frequency, and that they started talks with several radio companies including Klubr√°di√≥.M√°ris eladn√°k a Klub R√°di√≥ frekvenci√°j√°t Autoradio is reportedly asking HUF 200 million for the frequency enabling Klubr√°di√≥ to continue owning the frequency regardless of the court case if it raises the money.
