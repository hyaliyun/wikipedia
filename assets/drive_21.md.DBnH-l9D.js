They engage in processes such as negotiation, mediation, conciliation, and arbitration ‚Äì drawing on international law and norms. The objective is to move a violent conflict into non-violent dialogue, where differences are settled through conflict transformation processes or through the work of representative political institutions. Peacemaking can occur at different levels, sometimes referred to as 'tracks'. \\"High level\\" (governmental and international) peacemaking, involving direct talks between the leaders of conflicting parties, is sometimes thus referred to as Track 1. Tracks 2 and 3 are said to involve dialogue at 'lower' levels‚Äîoften unofficially between groups, parties, and stakeholders to a violent conflict‚Äîas well as efforts to avoid violence by addressing its causes and deleterious results. Peacemakers may be active in all three tracks, or in what is sometimes called multi-track diplomacy.  Nobel Peace laureates  The most prominent (and sometimes most controversial) peacemakers are the Nobel Peace laureates. 96 individuals and 20 organizations have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize since 1901 as a recognition of their remarkable contributions to peace.

He was born in the parish of Doon, at the foot of the Slieve Phelim hills in East Limerick, and was possibly a relatively wealthy landowner before becoming a rapparee. Under his expert guidance in 1690, Patrick Sarsfield and 500 Jacobite troops blew up the Williamite siege train at Ballyneety, Co. Limerick. One eyewitness account says that Galloping Hogan was given the honour of lighting the fuse. The Williamite war continued until the Treaty of Limerick was signed in October 1691. But Galloping Hogan refused to accept the Treaty and carried on the struggle for a further six months finally leaving Ireland with the last contingent of Wild Geese to sail from Cork in late Spring, 1692. Years later he ended his career as a senior officer in the Portuguese army. Galloping Hogan left Ireland for France where he became a General in the French Army. In 1706 he was forced to leave France because of killing a fellow officer in a duel in Flanders. He fled France for Portugal where he continued his military career. In May 1712, he contributed to the victory of the Portuguese Army against the Spanish at the Battle of Campo Maior. He remained in Portugal until his death and reared a distinguished family whom descendants of which still live in Portugal to this day. The story of Galloping Hogan is just one of the 14,000 soldiers who left Ireland in 1691 and spread their wings as far afield as Cuba and South America. This Exodus is commonly known as the Flight of the Wild Geese.

It was produced by Leonard Rosenman. Her first and only album until the release of The Soul of All Natural Things in 2014, it was all but completely ignored when originally released on Kapp Records in 1970. Discouraged by the lack of commercial attention and the label's reluctance to promote the album, Perhacs returned to her career as a dental hygienist.https://www.npr.org/2014/03/05/283049017/the-legend-of-linda- perhacs-a-most-unlikely-rock-star In the 30 or so years that followed, the album gradually developed a cult following. Folk label the Wild Places, which first reissued the album from a vinyl source in 1998, spent two years attempting to find Perhacs before contacting her in 2000, leading to a reissue of Parallelograms on CD and double LP in 2003. The reissue was sourced from tapes in Perhacs' personal collection, vastly improving on the sound quality of the original pressing, and added six bonus tracks of various demos and session outtakes. Sunbeam Records again reissued the album in 2008, adding two bonus tracks, the previously unreleased 1978 song \\"I Would Rather Love\\" and an excerpt of a 2005 BBC interview. Parallelograms was reissued again on vinyl by both Mexican Summer and Sundazed Records in 2010, and by Anthology Recordings in 2014.https://www.discogs.com/Linda-Perhacs-Parallelograms/master/129395 The song \\"Hey, Who Really Cares\\" was written as the theme song for the short-lived 1970 ABC drama Matt Lincoln, starring Vince Edwards, which ran for a half- season. Perhacs co-wrote the song with composer Oliver Nelson, who had been making music for numerous television shows at the time. The song was recorded for the show by the band God's Children, a short-lived collaboration between Ray Jimenez and Willie Garcia, previously both members of Thee Midniters, and released by Uni Records as a single under the title \\"Hey, Does Somebody Care.\\" \\"Hey, Who Really Cares\\" was covered by R&B; group the Whispers on its 1971 debut album, The Whispers' Love Story, and that version was later sampled by US hip hop artist the Notorious B.I.G. in his song \\"Niggas Bleed\\", released on his posthumous 1997 album Life After Death. The Perhacs recording was itself sampled by UK hip hop artist Lowkey in his song \\"Who Really Cares\\", which appeared on his 2009 compilation album Uncensored. The song \\"If You Were My Man\\" was featured in the 2007 film Daft Punk's Electroma. The song \\"Chimacum Rain\\" was sampled by Prefuse 73 on the track \\"Rain Edit (Interlude)\\" from the 2005 album Surrounded by Silence, and by Jadakiss on his song \\"Rain\\", released on his 2015 Top 5 Dead or Alive album.

Upon the crannog there are the remains of walls and several buildings. These remains are not unlike those of other fortified islands found throughout the Outer Hebrides, and it is likely that D√πn Anlaimh dates from the late Middle Ages. According to local tradition on Coll, the fort was once the home of a Norse chieftain who was defeated in battle somewhere nearby. The early 20th century antiquary Erskine Beveridge considered it as one of the four most interesting fortifications, on Coll (along with D√πn an Achaidh, D√πn Dubh, and D√πn Morbhaidh). The site of D√πn Anlaimh is located at . The RCAHMS classifies the site as a 'crannog' and an 'island dwelling'. Description Loch nan Cinneachan and Loch Anlaimh on an 1881 Ordnance Survey map. On this map, D√πn Anlaimh appears as \\"Eilean nan Cinneachan\\". =Analysis of the island= D√πn Anlaimh is a small artificial island located in Loch Nan Cinneachan on Coll (grid reference ).. The loch lies directly north of Loch Anlaimh which also has an artificial island within it. Confusingly, D√πn Anlaimh sometimes appears as \\"Eilean nan Cinneachan\\" on maps (see OS map pictured left) and the island in Loch Anlaimh is known as \\"Eilean Anlaimh\\". According to the 20th century antiquary Erskine Beveridge, the two lochs probably were joined at one time, and that this would explain why D√πn Anlaimh is not located within Loch Anlaimh. Beveridge also thought the names of the lochs were suggestive. According to him, the Gaelic Loch nan Cinneachan and Eilean nan Cinneachan mean loch and island of the \\"\\" or \\"gentiles\\". During the early Middle Ages the pagan Vikings were sometimes styled as \\"Gentiles\\" within the Irish Annals. The Gaelic personal name Anlaimh can also be linked with the Norsemen as it is a Gaelicisation of the Norse personal name Anlaf.. The island upon which D√πn Anlaimh occupies is roughly oval, almost circular in plan, and was about water level when visited by the RCAHMS in 1975. The RCAHMS recorded the dimensions of the island at about on the north-south axis and about on the east-west axis. In 1995, Mark W. Holley surveyed the site and measured it at the base of the island. The island is composed of about 80% medium-sized boulders and 20% large boulders. The island is situated on the north end of Loch nan Cinneachan and is connected to the east shore by a partly submerged causeway. Holley noted that the causeway had two defensive features. One was a 25 degree bend at the middle of the causeway; and the other was a rocking stone which tilts when under pressure. Holley recorded the depth of the loch around the island at to deep, with the deeper water on the western side. He noted that the surrounding water-bed was heavily silted, concealing the bottom; at least deep.. =Analysis of the ruins= According to the RCAHMS, it is difficult to estimate the age of the remains of D√πn Anlaimh. The ruins seem to resemble later fortified islands found in the Outer Hebrides, and it is likely that those of D√πn Anlaimh date to the mediaeval period. Although the site has no recorded history, the local tradition concerning D√πn Anlaimh appears to support the view that it was occupied in the Late Middle Ages. The remains of on a dry-stone enclosure are sometimes visible on the stony part of the island. The north part of the outer face of these remains stand at a maximum of about . A small inlet, located in the south-west corner of the island, may indicate the site of a boat landing. The island's summit is about above the level plane of the island, and is heavily overgrown with vegetation. The summit is also the site of the remains of three round-angled conjoined buildings that are rectangular in shape. All three buildings are aligned north-south, with their long axis parallel to the shore closest. The two main buildings are situated in a linear plan, aligned north-south. The walls of both structures are of dry-stone construction and are on average about thick; standing to a maximum height of . Building A is long and wide, with a doorway about wide located on the north end of the west side wall. Building B is long and wide internally. Building C is a smaller building which abuts the west wall of the main range. It lies adjacent to the entrance doorway of building A. It is long from the north-east to south-west corner, and transversely. The walls are on average thick. The entrance to the building is located on south- west end wall.. Like several other crannogs on Coll--such as those of Loch Anlaimh, Loch an Duin, and Loch Cliad--D√πn Anlaimh appears to have defensive features, in form of a bending causeway, incorporated within it. If the curving causeways of these crannogs were meant to lie under several feet of shallow water, these bends would have served to impede the advancement of enemies unaware of the correct route.. Tradition of Anlaimh of D√πn Anlaimh Location of duns, hillforts, and crannogs, on Coll. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, several Coll traditions were published which concerned several fortifications (hillforts, duns, and crannogs) on the island--one of which was D√πn Anlaimh. One such tradition was collected by Rev. John Gregorson Campbell, a former parish minister of Tiree, and published in 1895 Campbell's version runs as follows: According to Beveridge in 1903, the forts mentioned within this tradition are D√πn Anlaimh, D√πn Beic at Totronald, and D√πn Dubh. The Iain Garbh mentioned was a son of Lachlann Bronnach, chief of the Macleans of Duart (d. after 1472). Iain Garbh (b. c.1450) is claimed to be the ancestor of the Macleans of Coll.. Beveridge also made note of traditions of another battle fought near Grishipol, in which Iain Garbh and his followers defeated a force led by his step-father Gilleonan, chief of the MacNeils of Barra. Beveridge reasoned that this particular battle against the MacNeils probably took place around 1470-1480;. and wondered if there could be some sort of confusion between this conflict with the MacNeils and that of the Norsemen. D√πn Anlaimh on Loch nan Cinneachan, in 2006. In 1903, without prior knowledge to Campbell's tradition, Beveridge published another version of the 'Norsemen tradition' quoted above; one in which he had obtained viva voce. According to Beveridge, the events within this version of the tradition were said to have taken place at the precise date of 1384. However, he conceded that this date was calculated by the fact that when the Macleans of Coll sold their estate on the island in 1854, it was believed that they had owned their lands there for exactly 472 years. Beveridge also noted that the first historical connection between any Maclean and the island of Coll appears in a charter of confirmation, dated 1495, which states the Macleans were granted a charter to the island in 1409.. Beveridge's version of the tradition runs as follows: A version very similar to Beveridge's appears in the 1906 monograph written by Rev. Dugald MacEchern which was published in 1922.. MacEchern acknowledges the work of Beveridge and his version runs as follows: The tradition of D√πn Anlaimh has led some modern historians and scholars to regard the defeated Anlaimh as a possible progenitor of the MacAulays of North Uist, a family who are traditionally said to have settled on Uist after emigrating from the Inner Hebrides.. . via Google Books. via Google Books See also *D√πn an Achaidh, another dun on Coll traditionally linked to an Amlamh, or Olaf *Scotland in the Late Middle Ages Notes D√πn Anlaimh in 1905.

In the 1960s and 1970s a 2.6 litre straight-six petrol engine of Rover design was available as a option in the long wheelbase versions.6-cylinder engines have been used for Land Rover vehicles built under licence. Land Rover has also used various 4-cylinder, V8 engines and V6 engines developed by other companies, but this article deals only with engines developed specifically for Land Rover vehicles. Initially the engines used were modified versions of standard Rover car petrol engines, but the need for dedicated in-house units was quickly realised. The first engine in the series was the 1.6-litre petrol of 1957, and this design was improved, expanded and modified over several versions, culminating in the 300Tdi of 1994, which ceased production in 2006. Over 1.2 million engines in the series have been built.Based on minimum estimate from production figures accumulated from sources listed below, mainly Taylor (1988) and Dymock (2006) From 1998 the Td5 engine was fitted to Land Rover products. Whilst this 5-cylinder turbodiesel was unrelated in any way to the 4-cylinder designs and was originally intended for use in both Rover Cars and Land Rover 4√ó4s it only reached production in its Land Rover form.Robson, 2003, p.142 It was produced between 1998 and 2007, and 310,000 Td5s were built.Gould, 2007, p.127 Production of these engines originally took place at Rover's satellite factory (and ex-Bristol Hercules engine plant) at Acocks Green in Birmingham whilst vehicle assembly took place at the main Rover works at Solihull. After Land Rover was created as a distinct division with British Leyland in 1979 production of Rover cars at Solihull ceased in 1982. A new engine assembly line was built in the space vacated by the car lines and engine production started at Solihull in 1983.Gould, 2007, p.93 The engine line at Solihull closed in 2007 when Land Rover began using Ford and Jaguar engines built at Dagenham (diesel engines) and Bridgend (petrol engines). Some Land Rover engines have also been used in cars, vans and boats. This article only covers engines developed and produced specifically for Land Rover vehicles. It does not cover engines developed outside the company but used in its products, such as the Rover V8, the Rover IOE petrol engines or the current range of Ford/Jaguar-derived engines. The engines are listed below in the chronological order of their introduction. Description and specifications2-litre diesel= Throughout the 1950s there was an increasing demand for a diesel- engined Land Rover.Dymock, 2006, p.92 Diesel technology had improved, making small-capacity high-speed engines practical. Diesel power had also become prominent in industrial and agricultural uses throughout the world, and fleet users of Land Rovers were often in the situation where their Land Rovers were the only petrol-engined vehicles in their fleet, making spares, servicing and fuel supply more complex.Taylor, 1988, p.30 The Rover Motor Company was in talks with Standard-Triumph in 1954, with the possibility of a merger. Standard were Britain's pioneers of road-going small diesel engines with the 20C engine fitted to Ferguson tractors and the Standard Vanguard car (Britain's first diesel car). Rover engineers were able to study Standard's diesel designs as part of these. The merger was called off, but Rover had gained vital experience and knowledge in developing small diesel engines.Robson, 2003, p.33Taylor, 1988, p. 31 The result was a wet-liner 4-cylinder engine. Fuel injection equipment was from CAV, and the engine used Ricardo's Comet swirl chambers, but with Rover-developed dimples to produce quieter and smoother running. Heater plugs were fitted to each combustion chamber to improve starting. The engine was launched in the Land Rover in 1957. The vehicle had to have an extra let into the chassis in the engine bay to enable the new engine to fit.Taylor, 1988, p.32 The engine's power output and speed range was close enough to the existing petrol engine to allow the same transmission unit to be used on all vehicles.Taylor, 1988, p.29, quoting Rover brochureRobson, 2003, p.38 Used in: Land Rover Series I and Series II =2.25-litre petrol (Engine Codes 10H, 11H and 13H)= The Series II Land Rover launched in 1958 was larger, heavier and more complex than the original, and there was an ever-present need for higher powered engines.Taylor, 2007 Also, the Rover petrol engines in use at the time, with the archaic Inlet- Over-Exhaust valve layout and were approaching the age of 20 years in design terms. A new, larger petrol engine specifically developed for the Land Rover was needed.Taylor, 1988, p.35 The existing 2-litre diesel engine was used as a basis, but with a radically changed internal structure.Robson, 2003, p. 37 The new engine was a ‚Äòdry-liner' type, and a wider bore was used to improve low- speed torque output.Dymock, 2006, p. 96 Despite the numerous changes the petrol engine could use the same machining line as the diesel, establishing a design commonly used between Land Rover's petrol and diesel engines that would survive for decades. The 2.25-litre petrol was the most popular engine option right up to the mid-1980s and established a worldwide reputation for reliability and longevity.Hodder, 2000, p. 120 The engine's relatively low compression ratio and general strong design made it tolerant of poor quality fuel and oil as well as infrequent servicing. With proper maintenance these engines can easily survive more than of service. This was partly due to the commonality between petrol and diesel versions making the petrol version somewhat over-engineered for the job; they retained the extraordinary strength characteristics of the diesel while being much less stressed. The only major change to the design was the fitting of a 5-bearing crankshaft in 1980, which improved bottom-end strength and refinement.Hodder, 2000, p. 119-applies to mileage life and crankshaft modification Despite its utilitarian origins, the 2.25-litre petrol is a quiet, smooth-running engine, and this enabled Rover to fit it to their P4 saloon car as the Rover 80.Dymock. 2006, p. 96 Various power outputs were available for this engine depending on the compression ratio and the amount of emissions regulation equipment fitted.USA magazine 'Popular Imported Cars' quoted for an emissions-controlled engine in a Jan. 1974 test.Dymock, 2006 quotes as much as in a few instances.Robson, 2003, p.38 Used in: Land Rover Series II, Series III, and Ninety/One Ten/127; also Rover P4 80Dymock, 2006, p. 128 =2.25-litre diesel (Engine Code 10J)= The Series II Land Rover was a sales success, but there was still room for improvements. In 1962 the slightly altered Series IIA was launched. As well as some suspension and steering system changes, the biggest update was an improved diesel engine.Taylor, 1988, p.40 This shared many parts with its petrol- fuelled sibling, including the block, valve gear, cooling systems and lubrication systems.Taylor, 1988, p.40-41 A forged crankshaft was used for added strength, and different pistons were needed.Land Rover Series III Workshop Manual, p. 04-1 details shared components and differences The cylinder head used the same basic casting, but was very different internally, being in essence an updated version of that used on the original 2-litre engine, to which the new diesel bore a strong external resemblance. Like the 2.25-litre petrol, the 2.25-litre diesel was a dry-liner design. It was built on the same production line as the petrol engine and the flexibility of the basic design was much in evidence- for example, where the diesel engines had their fuel injector pumps, the petrol engine had its distributor fitted. Although it offered a modest improvement in power and a useful jump in torque, the main benefit of the new diesel engine was that it was much quieter and more efficient than the older unit.Taylor, 1988, p. 41 It also proved to be much more reliable in service. Like the petrol engine, the diesel was upgraded to a 5-bearing crankshaft in 1980. The engine was fitted to the Austin FX4 Black Cab between 1982 and 1985. FX4s fitted with the engine were designated 'FX4R' ('R' for 'Rover'). In this application the engine gained a reputation for very short service life and unreliability. This was caused by the significantly greater times spent at idle speed in the Black Cab than in the Land Rover. Solihull engineers had warned Carbodies, builders of the FX4R that this would cause problems as at idle speed the engine's oil pressure dropped, causing the automatic tensioner unit for the timing chain to not operate fully. At the high number of hours spent at idle speed (taxi drivers tended to leave the engines idling for long period whilst waiting for passengers or when off-duty as well as all the time spent in stationary traffic in London) this caused the timing chains to stretch, causing incorrect fuel injection timing which greatly reduced engine life. The 10J engine was also adapted into a marine engine by Mercury of the USA and sold under the Mercruiser 165 name.Dymock, 2006, p. 98 Used in: Land Rover Series II, Series III, and One Ten; also Carbodies FX4 (also called Austin FX4) and sold as a Mercury marine engine. There is also evidence of the 10J engine being offered as a conversion for Volga saloon cars by a Belgium-based company.Taylor, 1988, p.53 =2.5-litre diesel engine (Engine Code 11J, 12J, 13J, 14J and 15J)= Land Rover's radically updated product line was launched in 1983. Initially only the long-wheelbase One Ten was available and it was sold with the same engine line-up as the preceding Series III model- 2.25-litre petrol and diesel engines and the 3.5-litre Rover V8.Dymock, 2006, p. 124 However, Land Rover planned a series of rolling improvements.Hodder, 2000, p. 40 Launched shortly before the short-wheelbase Ninety model in 1984 was a 2.5-litre diesel engine. This was little more than an updated version of the existing diesel unitTaylor, 1988, p. 76 + 78 (at this time 22 years old). The stroke was lengthened to improve torque, and an updated cylinder head was used to reduce noise and emissions. A more modern injector pump improved fuel economy and an improved glow plug system improved cold-starting performance. The most significant change was the swapping of the chain-driven camshaft for one driven by a fibre toothed belt, which also drove the repositioned injector pump.Land Rover Workshop ManualTaylor, 1995, p.18 The drive vacated by the injector pump was used to power a vacuum pump for the brake servo system. To reduce engine weight, extensive use of aluminium castings was made for the cambelt case, vacuum pump, rocker cover and other parts.Taylor, 1988, p. 76 Other small improvements were made such as the fitment of a spin-on cartridge oil filter instead of older, harder-to-change element type and the fitting of under-piston oil jets. In the mid-1980s Land Rover was part of the Land Rover Group, responsible for production of the Freight Rover van. The 2.5-litre diesel was fitted to the Freight Rover 300series and the FX4 taxi (the engines for these applications had slight design changes, such as higher-mounted injector pumps and non-waterproof cambelt cases. They received the designations 14J and 15J respectively. Being fitted with a timing belt rather than a chain the 15J engine suffered none of the reliability problems in the FX4 that its 10J predecessor had encountered (see above)). The engine became a special-order only option after the introduction of turbodiesel engines (see below) but remained in production (and popular with military and some commercial buyers) until 1994.Robson, 2003, p. 98-99 The British Army used this engine in the vast majority of the 20,000 Land Rovers it bought between 1985 and 1994.Dymock. 2006, p.198 A manufacturing flaw with pistons combined with Army maintenance practises (such as a tendency to over-fill the sump with oil) caused the engines to over-breathe and ingest their oil, leading to piston failure. Late military-spec engines had a centrifugal separator in the breather system, allowing excess oil to drain back to the sump. These engines were designated 13J.Robson, 2003, p. 98Dymock, 2006, p.129 and 11J (ref Land Rover Defender Military 110 1991 Supplementary Parts Catalogue). These later, modified engines were the first in their class (small capacity high-speed diesels) to pass the Ministry of Defence's arduous 500-hour durability trial. Used in: Land Rover Ninety/One Ten/127, and Defender; also Freight Rover 300 and Carbodies FX4 (also called Austin FX4). =2.5-litre petrol engine (Engine Code 17H)= At the launch of the Ninety Land Rover had insisted that there would not be a 2.5-litre development of the petrol engine.Taylor, 1988, p.82 However, buyer demand and economics made the change inevitable. The larger petrol engine was launched in 1985 (having been developed under the codename 'Project Harrier') and, like its 2.25-litre predecessor it had much in common with the diesel engine.Robson, 2003, p.88‚Äîconfirms initial denial of 2.5-litre petrol and describes petrol/diesel parts commonality The block was identical, as were most ancillary parts. The key difference was that the petrol engine retained its timing chain,Hodder, 2000, p.114 since it lacked the need to drive an injector pump. The cylinder head was adapted to use unleaded fuel. As before, the engine was smooth and refined, and provided the Land Rover with adequate road performance.Robson, 2003, p.88 However, as fuel prices rose and diesel engines improved sales of the petrol engines fell, especially in Europe. It remained a popular option in Africa and other areas where fuel prices or the simplicity of the engine made it an attractive option. It remained available until 1994; although by this time sales had dwindled to almost nothing in the face of a new generation of refined diesel engines.Taylor, 1995, p.33Robson, 2003, p.78 By this time buyers were limited to those with specific reasons to buy petrol-engined vehicles- for example several police forces in the UK bought fleets of 2.5 petrol Defenders in the mid-1990s because a diesel-engined vehicles would have caused maintenance and logistical problems when operated alongside the fleet of standard patrol cars, all of which were petrol fuelled.Dymock, 2006, p.128 Used in: Land Rover Ninety/One Ten/127 and Defender =Diesel Turbo (Engine Code 19J)= Land Rover's global sales collapsed during the early 1980s.Taylor, 1988, p.71 This was mainly due to foreign competition offering larger, more powerful, more comfortable vehicles. Land Rover suffered from poor build quality and materials during the 1970s and by 1983 the then-current Series III model was distinctly outdated, despite recent improvements.Hodder, 2000, p.84 Land Rover decided to focus the sales of its Ninety/One Ten/127 range on the UK and Europe, for which it required a diesel engine with significantly better performance than the 2.5-litre type then in production. Project Falcon was started in 1984 to develop a turbocharged version of this engine.Hodder, 2000, p.49 The resulting engine was Land Rover's first production turbodiesel and their first engine to be given a marketing name- the Diesel Turbo,Taylor, 1988, p.84 a name given to differentiate it from the VM Motori-built turbodiesel then being used in the Range Rover, which was sold as the 'Turbo D'.Taylor, 1995, p.26 The Diesel Turbo, although essentially the same as the 2.5-litre diesel, had numerous additions and modifications to allow it to cope with the stresses of turbocharging. New pistons with Teflon-coated crowns and Nimonic steel exhaust valves were used to withstand higher combustion temperatures. The crankshaft was cross-drilled for improved strength and cooling. The block was modified to allow an oil feed/drain system to the turbocharger, and the cooling system was improved with an 8-bladed viscous fan and integral oil cooler. The engine was fitted with a high-capacity breather system to cope with the greater volumes of gas flow through the engine.Dymock, 2006, p.132-covers all engineering changes/development of this engine Despite the inherent age of the design, it performed well in tests against its rivals and provided the vital blend of performance and economy the Land Rover had needed for many years. It was the first diesel model to match the petrol engine's 4-ton towing limit and the first to be able to exceed the UK national speed limit of .Taylor, 1988, p.85 However, early engines suffered several failures. Most serious were failed main and big-end bearings and splits or cracks in the block.Dymock, 2006, p.132 In 1988 a new block and an improved design of bearing and bearing cap was fitted which solved these issues. The engine's higher internal temperatures meant that the cooling system also had to be maintained to a much higher standard than the earlier engines. Further changes were made in 1989, this time to the breather system to prevent oil being drawn into the air filter. Despite these issues, the Diesel Turbo was a strong seller. It was the standard engine for the UK and European markets and Land Rover's sales increased after its introduction.Taylor, 1988, p.89 Time has shown that these engines can turn in long service lives if maintained as required‚Äîlike many early turbodiesels, a lack of maintenance causes failure.Hodder, 2000, p.125-6Robson, 2003, p.79 Used in: Land Rover Ninety/One Ten/127 and Land Rover Llama prototype. = 200Tdi (engine code: 11L, 12L, 13L and 14L) = In 1989 Land Rover had launched the Discovery its Range Rover- based family 4√ó4 that quickly became Europe's top-selling 4√ó4.Dymock, 2006, p.162 One of the key reasons for its success was its ground-breaking turbo- diesel engine. The 200Tdi was one of the first mass-produced small-capacity (i.e., not a lorry engine) direct-injection diesels,Hodder, 2000, p.67 with the attendant improvements in power and efficiency that system brings. Developed under the codename Gemini, the 200Tdi was planned from the start to be used on all Land Rover's products. For production reasons, it had to be machined on the existing machinery, so used the same block and crankshaft as the existing 2.5-litre diesel engines. It also used many ancillary parts used on the older engines.Dymock, 2006, p.142Hodder, 2000, p.68 However, it was a true break with the past. An aluminium alloy cylinder head reduced weight and noise, a new Bosch injection system gave improved running characteristics and better starting performance. An intercooler boosted power and efficiency further. Lessons learnt from the Diesel Turbo were included, such as the fitment of an inertial separator in the breather system to remove oil before crankcase gases were returned to the air intake. Initially turbocharged and naturally aspirated diesel versions and a carburettor-fed petrol version were to be produced. The direct-injection system meant that only machining of the injector sockets was needed to allow the fitment of spark plugs. However, the performance and economy of the turbodiesel version was such that the other variants were not produced. The 200Tdi was launched in the Discovery in 1989. It was then fitted to the utility Land Rover (renamed the Defender) in late 1990.Robson, 2003, p.96 For this application the engine was slightly de-tuned and, whilst in the Discovery the 200Tdi used all-new components, packaging restraints in the Defender meant that the 200Tdi in this role shared many exterior parts (such as the timing belt system and case) with the Diesel Turbo. Most obviously the turbocharger was retained in the Diesel Turbo's high mounting position on top of the manifolds in the Defender, rather than being tucked under the manifolds in the original Discovery version.Dymock, 2006, p.134 In 1992 the engine was fitted to the Range Rover. In the Range Rover it has a 14L engine number. Although the older petrol and naturally aspirated diesel units were theoretically still available, the 200Tdi had better performance and economy than any of them, and so dominated the sales figures.Robson, 2003, p.99 It is still highly regarded by Land Rover enthusiasts and has established itself as a powerful and long-lived unit that with proper maintenance can exceed of use.Hodder, 2000, p.127Robson, 2003, p.98 Used in: Land Rover Defender, Discovery and Range Rover = 300Tdi (engine code: 16L and 20L) = Although the 200Tdi engine had been an undoubted technological and sales success, it had certain limitations and flaws that needed to be rectified. Despite the numerous differences, it was still in essence a direct-injection version of the older Diesel Turbo engine. It was also considered rather raucous and unrefined, especially for use in the Discovery and Range Rover models.Robson, 2003, p.106 A special version of the engine had to be produced to fit the Defender, and problems with weak head gasket had been identified.Hodder, 2000, p.114 + 127 The British Army (and some other military buyers) had not opted for the 200Tdi because it could not be fitted with a 24-volt generator for powering radio equipment- instead the Army continued to buy vehicles with 2.5-litre naturally aspirated diesels. Upcoming European diesel emissions regulations (Euro I) meant that Land Rover would be forced to radically alter the engine anyway. The resulting development project (coded Romulus) produced the 300Tdi engine. Although externally very similar to the Discovery/Range Rover version of its predecessor, 208 changes were made. These included modifications to the block, cylinder head, fuel injector system and ancillary systems. The crankshaft, pistons and connecting rods were significantly altered over the 200Tdi.Robson, 2003, p.107‚Äîcovers number and nature of design changes The most obvious external changes were the fitting of a rubber acoustic cover over the engine to reduce noise and the change to a single serpentine belt to drive the ancillaries instead of the multiple V-belts of the older engines. Emissions regulation included the fitting of an exhaust gas recirculation system. Power and torque outputs remained the same, and the engine had been specifically designed to be compatible with all the models in the Land Rover range without any changes. This meant that the Defender engines were fitted in the same tune as the Discovery/Range Rover engines. The 300Tdi was noticeably smoother and quieter than the 200Tdi, but was generally found to not be quite as economical in real-world use.Hodder, 2000, p.128 It turned out that the Euro I emissions regulations were not as severe as Land Rover anticipated, and so the 300Tdi was able to remain in production until the introduction of the Euro III rules. When fitted to vehicles with an automatic transmission, power was increased to to make up for the power losses in the transmission. These engines (designated 23L) had Bosch Electronic Diesel Control systems, where the mechanical injector system was controlled by a drive-by-wire electronic throttle to reduce emissions.Dymock, 2006, p.172 The 300Tdi was replaced in 1998 by the 5-cylinder Td5, bringing to an end the line of Land Rover 4-cylinder engines that can be traced back to 1957. The Td5 engine was loosely based on the Rover Group's L-series diesel engine. The 300Tdi remained in production in Brazil, and was offered as an option on rest of world (non-UK/Europe) models. Following Ford's acquisition of Land Rover in 2000, the engine was used in Brazilian-built Ford pick-up trucks as well. Increasingly restrictive emissions laws worldwide and falling sales led to production of the 300Tdi ending in 2006. A much-modified 2.8-litre version was built by International Engines in Brazil until 2010, and was available as an after-market fitment to Land Rovers through specialist converters.Dymock, 2006, p.140 International then became MWM International Motores and a further update of the 300Tdi design was launched as the 3.0 Power Stroke. Although based around the same block and basic architecture as the 300Tdi the Power Stroke has major differences such as electronic common rail injection and new crossflow cylinder head with Overhead camshaft. Used in: Land Rover Defender, Discovery, and Range Rover \\"Classic\\"; also various Brazil-assembled Ford pickup trucks. = Td5 (engine codes: 10P, 15P and 16P)= By the mid-1990s the Rover Group was looking to rationalise its engine ranges and produce new designs that would be able to meet emissions legislation for the foreseeable future. The recently released K-Series petrol engine range would be extended to cover that sector, but Rover had no in-house diesel engines suitable for both its cars and its 4√ó4s. The 300Tdi could not be fitted to any of the car range and was about to fall foul of the upcoming Euro III emissions standards. The existing L-Series 2-litre diesel was not suitable for use in Land Rover products and could not be developed into such a unit. It was decided to design a new diesel engine family that could be produced in various capacities and states of tune suitable for all of Rover's needs. The development was codenamed Project Storm and design responsibility was given to Land Rover who were to build the engines. The result was a range of engines using the L-Series as a base‚Äîthe bore/stroke dimensions were the same and the Storm engine used the same piston and connecting rod assemblies. The Storm utilised Electronic Unit Injection by Lucas (at the time this technology was rare on small-capacity engine, being used only on large commercial vehicles) and a cross-flow aluminium alloy cylinder head on a cast-iron block. The designers had aimed at increasing servicing intervals so the engine incorporated both conventional and centrifugal oil filters. The electronic systems included an 'anti-stall' system to allow heavy loads to be started from rest at idle speed and two programmed operating modes for road and off-road use. The overhead camshaft (operating both valves and the unit injectors) was driven by a duplex chain assembly. The Storm design encompassed 4-, 5- and 6-cylinder engines (of 2, 2.5 and 3 litres respectively). In the event the takeover of the Rover Group by BMW, who brought their own range of diesel engines, made the Storm engine largely redundant.Robson, 2003, p.143 Only the 5-cylinder version made it to production as the powerplant for the Defender and the new Discovery Series II as the 'Td5' in 1998. Offering more power and greater refinement than the 300Tdi the Td5 greatly improved the appeal of the Discovery but caused concern amongst many operators of the Defender due to its electronic engine management systems which were considered to be less reliable and more difficult to repair 'in the field' than the mechanical injection systems used on previous Land Rover diesel engines. In deference to these concerns (including those voiced by the British Army) Land Rover kept the 300Tdi in production for fitment to special-order vehicles (see above). It transpired that the Td5's electronics were highly reliable. Early engines suffered two isolated mechanical failures‚Äîsudden and complete failure of the oil pump drive and 'cylinder head shuffle' caused by weak retaining studs. Both these faults were fixed within 2 years of the engine starting production and the Td5 is now considered highly reliable. In 2002 the engine was improved to reach Euro 3 antipollution stage, and an EGR Valve system was introduced. Electronics were also updated to improve the low-speed throttle response which had been prone to producing a jerky power delivery in off-road or towing situations. The engine has proved itself on numerous expeditions in hostile terrain (including Land Rover's own G4 Challenge).Dymock, 2006, p.264 The engine's mechanical strength and electronic control systems makes the Td5 much more tuneable than the older engines. Numerous aftermarket companies produced tuning upgrades offering as much as . The Td5 was replaced in the Discovery by the AJD-V6 unit in 2004 and the Ford ZSD-424 in the Defender in 2007. Production of the Td5 at Solihull ceased that year making it the last Land Rover-designed-and-built engine.Dymock, 2006, p.182 Used in: Land Rover Defender and Land Rover Discovery. Santana engines In 1956, the Rover Company held talks with Spanish engineering company 'Metal√∫rgica de Santa Ana S.A.' (later to be renamed Santana Motor) with the aim of starting Land Rover assembly in Spain. Under the terms of the agreement Santana would initially build Land Rovers from Complete Knock Down kits shipped from Britain, but locally manufactured content would gradually be increased until the entire vehicles were built from scratch in Spain. Santana would also have exclusive sales rights in Spain, South America, Central America and North Africa, selling both Santana- and Land Rover-badged vehicles in these markets where necessary. Production at Santana started in 1958. From 1962 Santana began to improve and modify the Land Rover design to meet the demands of its own markets. These were the common demands of more power, better ride comfort and improved refinement. To this end Santana produced several unique versions of the Land Rover engine designs it had rights to. These included six-cylinder versions of the 2.25-litre petrol and diesel engines in the late 1960s and a turbocharged version of the 2.25 diesel in 1982. In the early 1980s when Land Rover was looking for ways to improve its engine range, especially its diesels, the Santana engines were looked at. The 6-cylinder version was considered too large and heavy for the Range Rover but a turbocharged 5-cylinder variant was considered since it provided an ideal blend of power, weight and size. The 2.25TD was studied to provide development information for the Diesel Turbo engine. In the end production reasons meant that Land Rover favoured a diesel version of the Rover V8 instead. When that engine did not reach production Range Rover diesel engines were bought-in from VM Motori.

He has been president and chief executive officer of Public Radio International (PRI) and senior vice president at WNET/Thirteen in New York City, the flagship producer for the PBS television network.  Biography  Salyer was elected president and chief executive officer of the Salzburg Global Seminar in September 2005. Founded in 1947 by a young Austrian studying at Harvard University who wanted to create a \\"Marshall Plan of the Mind,\\" Salzburg facilitates cross-sector development of strategic solutions, conducts international leadership development programs for rising stars in government, business, NGOs and academe, and offers model curricula and content to policy and education networks worldwide. Though an American organization, Salzburg's program is centered at the historic Schloss Leopoldskron on the southern outskirts of Salzburg.  Professional career  Prior to assuming the Salzburg presidency, Salyer served as president and chief executive officer of Public Radio International (PRI). Under his leadership PRI became a leading developer and distributor of programs with a global perspective, and a leader in using digital technology to reach younger audiences. His vision defined PRI's mission: to help Americans understand their diverse, interdependent world. Salyer played a leadership role in designing and launching such ground-breaking programs as: Marketplace, the business program with the largest audience in U.S. radio or television; PRI's The World, the only daily international news hour produced for the American market; and Studio 360, the pre-eminent arts and culture magazine on public radio. He brought global news to American listeners by forging an expansive partnership with the BBC World Service to make its 24-hour news channel available to PRI's 800+ stations nationwide. Salyer also co-founded Public Interactive, LLC, the leading force in public broadcasting enabling on-line community and audience interaction, and chaired its Board from 1999 to 2005. PRI recently reached agreement with NPR to extend Public Interactive's tools and services to all public stations in the United States. Salyer also served for nine years as a vice president and then as senior vice president at WNET/Thirteen in New York City, the flagship PBS producer, where he led departments responsible for national program development, international co-production, education, and communications. As head of the station's Education Division, he formed in 1983 an experimental design department, the WNET Learning Lab, which pioneered early computer-based, interactive media instruction. Before joining public broadcasting, Salyer directed the Population Council's Public Issues Program, and was the youngest person ever appointed to a presidential commission (age 19), serving while still an undergraduate at Davidson College as a member of the Commission on Population Growth and the American Future. Salyer's recent board service includes Internews US and EU Boards, Salzburg Global Seminar, Lloyd N. Cutler Center for the Rule of Law Advisory Board, Guidestar USA, Inc., Davidson College, MacPhail Center for Music, Public Interactive, LLC and Public Radio International.  Salzburg Global Seminar  After joining the Salzburg Global Seminar in September 2005, Salyer initiated a strategic review of the institution's mission, goals, strategy, measures of success, financial sustainability and governance. The resulting strategic plan guided Salzburg's emergence as a reinvigorated institution ‚Äì encouraging a cross-cutting focus on issues and outcomes, attracting new financial support, and creating a platform on which its 25,000 Fellows in 160 countries can engage and collaborate. Programs launched and personally led by Salyer include multi-year initiatives on \\"Strengthening Independent Media\\" and \\"Optimizing Institutional Philanthropy\\", supported respectively by the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation and by the Heron and Kellogg Foundations. Both initiatives brought together leading donors and thought leaders from all parts of the world to accelerate innovation in areas of particular promise. Salyer proposed and co- founded with his wife, Susan Moeller, Professor at the Merrill School of Journalism at the University of Maryland, the Salzburg Academy on Media and Global Change. Since 2007, each summer, the Salzburg Academy has brought together students and faculty from five continents with leading journalists and media entrepreneurs. During their residency in Salzburg, the participants analyze media practices on a comparative basis, create case studies and curricular modules, conduct research, and test new media concepts. Recent journalists in residence at the Academy have included Pulitzer Prize-winner Dana Priest of the Washington Post, Charles Sennott of the 'Global Post', Will Dobson of National Public Radio, Lucio Mesquite of BBC Monitoring and Robin Wright of The New Yorker. With Salyer's encouragement, a \\"Writer in Residence\\" program was established with the world-renowned Salzburg Festival, bringing leading novelists and essayists to Schloss Leopoldskron for readings, lectures and discussions in August of each year. Participants have included Nobel Prize Winner Orhan Pamuk and Pulitzer Prize Winners Richard Ford and Jeffrey Eugenides. In 2012, Salyer organized an annual program on private and public international law and public service - the Salzburg Cutler Fellows Program - for faculty and students from eleven of the top U.S. law schools (Chicago, Columbia, Duke, Georgetown, Harvard, Michigan, NYU, Penn, Stanford, UVA, Yale). Held at the U.S. Institute of Peace in Washington, 55 Cutler Fellows produce papers on topics at the leading edge of international law. Their ideas are presented to and critiqued by a panel of leading judges, academic experts and practitioners and selected Cutler Fellows are invited to participate subsequently in Salzburg Global seminars corresponding to their fields of interest. The Cutler Fellows and an annual Cutler Lecture at the US Supreme Court are part of an expanding Lloyd N. Cutler Center for the Rule of Law, founded in 2007 at the Salzburg Global Seminar by Salyer and B. Thomas Mansbach, who chairs the Cutler Center Advisory Board. Cutler Lecturers have included Richard Goldstone, Harold Koh, Anne-Marie Slaughter, Helena Kennedy, Stephen Breyer, Eric Schmidt, John Bellinger Alberto Ibarguen and James Thornton. From 2018-2020, Salzburg Global Seminar in partnership with the Salzburg Festival have together organized exhibits and symposia to mark the 100th Anniversary of theatre impresario Max Reinhardt's purchase of historic Schloss Leopoldskron in 1918. To celebrate the Centennial of Reinhardt's co- founding in 1920 of the Salzburg Festspiele, Salzburg Global plans an international seminar on the future of festivals across the world.  Education  Salyer has received numerous awards and fellowships, including Distinguished Service Award from Davidson College (1997); U.S.-Japan Leadership Fellow (1996); British-American Fellow (1990); Root-Tilden Scholar, New York University School of Law (1976‚Äì79); Administrative Fellow, Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University (1974‚Äì75); Salzburg Fellow (1974); Thomas J. Watson Fellow (1974); Dana Scholar, Davidson College (1970‚Äì72); North Carolina Leadership Fellow (1969‚Äì72). He is a graduate of Davidson College from which he was awarded an honorary doctor of laws degree in 2003, and of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.

The missile was known as the \\"RB-304\\" during development and early service years. While interest in guided anti-ship missiles was subdued in the 1950s, it was not entirely extinct. In 1949, the Swedish government placed a request for a radar-guided, air-launched anti-ship missile. The request materialized as the SAAB \\"Robot-Byr√•n (RB) 04\\", which was first test launched by a Saab 29 Tunnan fighter in early 1955. The early versions of the missile suffered teething problems in regards to the two targeting modes, which were area attack, for striking a big group of ships (like an invasion fleet), and select targeting, where the missiles home in on a single vessel. In the area attack the missile would only target a ship in the group if they were within 1,000 meters of another vessel, this was also in the early electronic age, and changes in this distance required hardware modifications in a workshop. :*RB-04C: The initial production version, the \\"RB-04C\\", entered service with Swedish Air Force A 32A Lansen attack aircraft in 1959. The RB-04C had a canard configuration, with short triangular cruciform fins around the nose, and two wide wings with fins attached to the wingtips. The RB-04C had a boost- sustain solid rocket motor and a SAP warhead that could be fitted with a contact or proximity fuse. :*RB-04D: Further development of the C version. Longer range rocket engines and maintenance free thermal batteries where the main improvements. Introduced in the late 1960s. :*RB-04E: Further development of the D version to suit the new AJ37 Viggen strike aircraft. The missile had a shorter wingspan and improved guidance system and new monopulse radar seeker, which allowed sea-skimming approaches. This version was highly resistant to ECM and would automatically lock on especially powerful jamming signals. Robot 04 on A32A Lansen Many components of the missile were reused when the RBS-15 was developed, including the main body and warhead, although the motor and main wings were the most obvious external changes. The missile has never seen combat; the closest thing it has come to being used was during the \\"Whiskey on the Rocks\\" incident in 1981, when a Soviet (NATO code Whiskey Class) submarine ran aground outside the naval station in Karlskrona. Swedish AJ37 Viggens with RB-04E's mounted under their wings, taken from top secret storage bunkers, stood on high alert for a possible Soviet incursion. On one occasion, when a Soviet rescue operation seemed to be underway, aircraft were scrambled with the intent to intercept Soviet ships.

This monumental work was published in thirteen folios and provided a wealth of detail covering ancient and modern cartographers and geographers, together with astronomical and historical data. These maps were engraved in a bold style and printed on fine white paper, the more important ones spread over two sheets, allowing for great detail. The first part comprises an introduction to geography with engravings of globes, wind roses, and cosmographic systems through the ages from Ptolemy, Copernicus and Tycho Brahe to Descartes. The second part deals exclusively with the earth, starting with a map by Ptolemy, and two modern maps, each covering a hemisphere, followed by two double-page maps of Europe, Asia, Africa, North and South America, ending with maps of the North and South Pole. The third part deals with hydrography - the oceans, rivers, lakes and deltas. Here are to be found maps of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, the Bosporus, Gulf of Venice and rivers such as the Niger River, Amazon River, Rhine, Danube, and Volga.

For the history of the region, see History of Pomerania. S≈Çonowice is served by the S≈Çonowice (PKP station), which had been built in the 19th century to serve the estate of Gro√ü Schl√∂nwitz, then the property of the von Blumenthal family, who inherited it from Valeska von Krockow, wife of Herrmann von Blumenthal. During the 1930s the estate was 90% owned by Professor Albrecht von Blumenthal, 10% by his brother Robert, who resided there. The estate became an outpost of the secret education of pastors for the Nazi- opponent fraction of the united Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union, represented by the Confessing Church and its brethren councils, persecuted by the Nazis during the struggle of the churches. After the Gestapo had closed the preacher seminary in Stettin-Finkenwalde in autumn 1937, in December the same year the brothers Albrecht and Robert von Blumenthal permitted its lecturer, the Protestant pastor and theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer, to use the local vicarage as an illegal seminary (Sammelvikariat). The pastors of Gro√ü Schl√∂nwitz and neighbouring villages supported the education by employing and housing the students as vicars in their congregations.Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Pfarrer, Berlin-Charlottenburg 9, Marienburger Allee 43: Begleitheft zur Ausstellung, corr. a. ext. ed., Kuratorium Bonhoeffer Haus (ed.), Berlin: Erinnerungs- und Begegnungsst√§tte Bonhoeffer Haus, ¬≤1996, p. 51. No ISBN. In summer 1939 the seminary could move to Sigurdshof, an outlying estate (Vorwerk) of von Kleist family in Wendisch Tychow. There the Gestapo shut down the seminary in March 1940. The manor house of Gro√ü Schl√∂nwitz burned down by chance in 1939. The place after the war lies in Poland. It was overtaken by communists who incorporated the estate into the Sysewice Agricultural State Kombinat (German: Zitzewitz Kombinat). The Vicarage and church are still to be seen; the latter, now Catholic, contains a painting of Dietrich Bonhoeffer as a Christ-figure.

She wrote a book of reminiscences about her father, and in conjunction with her aunt, Georgina Hogarth, she edited the first collection of his letters.\\"The Letters of Charles Dickens\\" on Project Gutenberg Childhood Mamie Dickens was born at the family home in Doughty Street in London Lucinda Hawksley website and was named after her maternal aunt Mary Hogarth, who had died in 1837. Her godfather was John Forster, her father's friend and later biographer. Mary was nicknamed \\"Mild Glo'ster\\" by her father.Peter Ackroyd Dickens Published by Sinclair-Stevenson (1990), p. 452. In December 1839 the Dickens family moved from 48 Doughty Street to 1 Devonshire Terrace. Of her childhood here she later wrote: > \\"I remember that my sister and I occupied a little garret room in Devonshire > Terrace, at the very top of the house. He had taken the greatest pains and > care to make the room as pretty and comfortable for his two little daughters > as it could be made. He was often dragged up the steep staircase to this > room to see some new print or some new ornament which we children had put > up, and he always gave us words of praise and approval. He encouraged us in > every possible way to make ourselves useful, and to adorn and beautify our > rooms with our own hands, and to be ever tidy and neat. I remember that the > adornment of this garret was decidedly primitive, the unframed prints being > fastened to the wall by ordinary black or white pins, whichever we could > get. But, never mind, if they were put up neatly and tidily they were always > excellent, or quite slap-up as he used to say. Even in those early days, he > made a point of visiting every room in the house once each morning, and if a > chair was out of its place, or a blind not quite straight, or a crumb left > on the floor, woe betide the offender.\\"Dickens, Mary Charles Dickens by His > Eldest Daughter Cassell & Co, London (1885) She and her younger sister Kate were taught to read by their aunt, Georgina Hogarth, who was now living with the family. Later they had a governess. In her book Charles Dickens by His Eldest Daughter (1885), she described her father's method of writing: > \\"As I have said, he was usually alone when at work, though there were, of > course, some occasional exceptions, and I myself constituted such an > exception.... I had a long and serious illness, with an almost equally long > convalescence. During the latter, my father suggested that I should be > carried every day into his study to remain with him, and, although I was > fearful of disturbing him, he assured me that he desired to have me with > him. On one of these mornings, I was lying on the sofa endeavouring to keep > perfectly quiet, while my father wrote busily and rapidly at his desk, when > he suddenly jumped from his chair and rushed to a mirror which hung near, > and in which I could see the reflection of some extraordinary facial > contortions which he was making. He returned rapidly to his desk, wrote > furiously for a few moments, and then went again to the mirror. The facial > pantomime was resumed, and then turning toward, but evidently not seeing, > me, he began talking rapidly in a low voice. Ceasing this soon, however, he > returned once more to his desk, where he remained silently writing until > luncheon time. It was a most curious experience for me, and one of which, I > did not until later years, fully appreciate the purport. Then I knew that > with his natural intensity he had thrown himself completely into the > character that he was creating, and that for the time being he had not only > lost sight of his surroundings, but had actually became in action, as in > imagination, the creature of his pen.\\" In 1855 Charles Dickens took his two daughters to Paris. He told his friend Angela Burdett-Coutts that his intention was to give Mary (then aged 17) and Kate (aged 16) \\"some Parisian polish\\". While in France they had dancing lessons, art classes and language coaching. They also had Italian lessons from the exiled patriot Daniele Manin.Mary 'Mamie' Dickens on 'Spartacus Educational' website She appeared in a number of amateur plays directed by her father, including Wilkie Collins's The Lighthouse in which Charles Dickens also acted along with Collins, Augustus Egg, Mark Lemon and Georgina Hogarth. The production ran for four nights from 16 June 1855 at Tavistock House, Dickens's home, followed by a single performance on 10 July at Campden House, Kensington.The Lighthouse website In January 1857 she appeared in The Frozen Deep, again written by Collins and performed at Tavistock House before the Duke of Devonshire, Lord Lansdowne, Lord Houghton, Angela Burdett-Coutts and Edward Bulwer-Lytton.'Charles Dickens' by Una Pope Hennessy Published by Chatto & Windus, London (1945) pg 360 In 1857 Dickens was visited at Gads Hill Place by Danish author and poet Hans Christian Andersen, who was invited for two weeks but who stayed for five. Andersen described Mary as resembling her mother.Ackroyd, pg 782 Author Peter Ackroyd described her as being \\"...amiable, somewhat sentimental, but high-spirited and with a love for what might be called the life of London society. She seems to have attached herself to her father with an almost blind affection; certainly, she never married and, of all the children, she was the one closest to him for the rest of his life.\\"Ackroyd, pg 877 After her parents separated in 1858 Mary Dickens and her aunt Georgina Hogarth were put in command of the servants and household management. She did not see her mother again until after her father's death in 1870.Henessey, pg 392 Of her father's alleged affair with the actress Ellen Ternan, which has been stated as the reason for the break-up of Charles Dickens' marriage, biographer Lucinda Hawksley wrote: Katey and their father Charles Dickens at Gads Hill Place c.1865 > \\"For Katey and Mamie, the knowledge that their father was sexually attracted > to a girl their own age must have been utterly distasteful. Children are > never happy to think about their parents' sex life and, in the nineteenth > century, sex was a subject seldom discussed between the generations.... In a > little over fifteen years, Catherine had given birth to ten children, as > well as suffering at least two miscarriages. It is no wonder she did not > have the energy of her childfree younger sister; nor that she lost the slim > figure she had possessed when Charles married her. Towards the end of their > marriage he had often made cruel jokes about her size and stupidity while > praising Georgina to the hilt as his helpmeet and saviour. Both Katey and > Mamie ‚Äì by dint of being female ‚Äì would undoubtedly have cringed at the way > their father spoke about their mother and the way he made no secret of > preferring the company of her sister, of Ellen and, for that matter, almost > any other young attractive woman.\\"Hawksley, Lucinda Katey: The Life and > Loves of Dickens's Artist Daughter Published by Doubleday, (2006) Because Mary and Katey decided to stay with their father rather than with their mother they experienced a certain amount of social coldness. A relative of their mother wrote, \\"... they, poor girls, have also been flattered as being taken notice of as the daughters of a popular author. He, too, is a caressing father and indulgent in trifles, and they in their ignorance of the world, look no further nor are aware of the injury he does them.\\"Backroom, pg 842 When Dickens decided to burn all his letters in 1860 in the field behind Gads Hill Place it was Mary and two of her brothers who carried them out of the house in basketfuls. These included correspondence from Alfred Tennyson, Thomas Carlyle, Thackeray, Wilkie Collins and George Eliot. Mary asked her father to keep some of them, but he refused, burning everything.Ackroyd, pg 882 In 1867 Mary was asked to name and launch a new ship at Chatham Dockyard, where her grandfather John Dickens had previously worked. She became a local celebrity in Kent, being the first woman there to be seen in public riding a bicycle.Hawksley, Lucinda Dickens Charles Dickens Andre Deutsch (2011) pg 33 Mary Dickens became the official hostess at Gads Hill Place in Kent, Dickens's country home, staying with her father for the rest of his life. Her portrait was painted by John Everett Millais. She never married, although it is believed she received a proposal of marriage, which she refused because her father disapproved of the suitor. As a result, she suffered a prolonged bout of depression. However, Charles Dickens had hoped she would eventually marry and have children. In 1867 he wrote to a friend that Mary had \\"not yet started any conveyance on the road to matrimony.\\" But he hoped that she still might, \\"as she is very agreeable and intelligent\\". He had suggested to her that his friend Percy Fitzgerald would make a good husband, but Dickens later wrote, \\"I am grievously disappointed that Mary can by no means be induced to think as highly of him as I do\\". Later years Georgina Hogarth and Mamie Dickens After her father's death she lived with her brother Henry Dickens and her aunt, Georgina Hogarth;The Family Tree of Charles Dickens by Mark Charles Dickens Published by the Charles Dickens Museum (2005) In his will her father had written, \\"I give the sum of ¬£1,000 free of legacy duty to my daughter Mary Dickens. I also give to my said daughter an annuity of ¬£300 a year, during her life, if she shall so long continue unmarried; such annuity to be considered as accruing from day to day, but to be payable half yearly, the first of such half yearly payments to be made at the expiration of six months next after my decease.\\" Georgina Hogarth found living with Mary difficult, complaining that she was drinking too much.Georgina Hogarth on Spartacus Educational With her aunt she edited two volumes of Dickens's letters, which were published in 1880. Later she seems to have embarrassed or angered her family, who largely cut themselves off from her. Much of her life after her father's death in 1870 remains unknown, but after leaving her aunt's she lived for a period with a clergyman and his wife, Mr and Mrs Hargreaves, in Manchester, a \\"scandal\\" which was kept a secret by her family.Hawksley, pg 34 Later she lived alone in the country. Mary Dickens went on to write My Father as I Recall Him (1886),The Children of Charles Dickens and a novel, Cross Currents (1890). On Mary's death her aunt, Georgina Hogarth, wrote to Connie Dickens, the widow of Edward Dickens: > \\"My love for Mamie as you know was most true and tender ‚Äì so was her > sister's and Harry's ‚Äì But the loss ‚Äì out of our lives ‚Äì is not so great as > it would have been years ago ‚Äì For it is a long time since she ceased to be > my companion.

Forsythe has an important place in the history of college athletics in the U.S. state of Florida as the first head coach of the team now known as the University of Florida Gators. He had previously been the last football coach at Florida State College, now Florida State University, before it was reorganized as a school for women. Early years Forsythe was born in Brevard, North Carolina. He claimed to have been at the first instance of the \\"Big Thursday\\" Clemson‚ÄìSouth Carolina rivalry in Columbia, South Carolina in 1896.

Moreover, he played every minute of those eighteen games, providing a remarkable example of athletic stamina and resilience.Wiley Lee Umphlett, Creating the Big Game: John W. Heisman and the Invention of American Football, Greenwood Press, Westport, Connecticut, p. 67 (1992). As was typical in the early 1900s, Forsythe played both offense and defense. Teammates on the line included Vet Sitton, Hope Sadler, and O. L. Derrick.  Coaching career  Forsythe became an assistant coach for the fledgling football team of Florida State College (now Florida State University) in 1903.Ric A. Kabat, \\"Before the Seminoles: Football at Florida State College, 1902‚Äì1904,\\" Florida Historical Quarterly, vol. LXX, no. 1, p. 35 (July 1991). Florida State College's head coach, W. W. Hughes, planned to use Forsythe as a fullback in a game against the University of Florida in Lake City (one of the predecessor institutions of the modern University of Florida, previously known as Florida Agricultural College), creating a controversy between the teams.Kabat, \\"Before the Seminoles,\\" p. 34. For the 1904 season, the third and last for FSC's football team, Hughes transferred all coaching duties to Forsythe. The reason for this is unknown, but Hughes, who was also a Latin professor, may have taken on increased academic duties. Forsythe played on top of his coaching duties, and was probably paid. Under Forsythe, the FSC football team defeated the University of Florida at Lake City, and after defeating Stetson College (now Stetson University), FSC was declared \\"champion of Florida\\" by The Florida Times-Union newspaper of Jacksonville. In 1905 the Florida Legislature passed the Buckman Act, which reorganized higher education in Florida. The University of Florida in Lake City was merged with three other institutions to form the new \\"University of the State of Florida\\", a school for white men in Gainesville. Florida State College became the Florida Female College, a school for white women, and a number of its former male students transferred to the new men's university.Kabat, \\"Before the Seminoles,\\" p. 37. With the ending of FSC's football program, Forsythe coached the University School for Boys prep team in Stone Mountain, Georgia for a year.\\" The University of the State of Florida opened in Gainesville in 1906, and in May, Forsythe was hired to be the school's first football coach and director of athletics.Florida Agricultural College in Lake City, Florida and the East Florida Seminary in Ocala were two of the four predecessor institutions of the modern University of Florida, and both fielded football teams as early as 1899. Although the modern University of Florida traces its lineage to these college, it does not recognize the football games played by its predecessor schools as part of its football record.

They were top idols for a good part of the eighties in Japan. When the band broke up, he turned to acting. His first main role in film was as a Zen monk in comedy directed by Masayuki Suo.

His breakthrough on the international stage came with the 2008 film directed by Y≈çjir≈ç Takita. He played cellist-turned-mortician protagonist in this dramatic film which received the Best Foreign Language Film award at the 81st Academy Awards, as well as six acting awards for Motoki.
