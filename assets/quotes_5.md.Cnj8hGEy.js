Early years He was born in 1914 in the Central Anatolian town of Kayseri, located at the foothills of Mt. Aergus (the volcano Erciyes). He won a state scholarship to study natural sciences abroad, as part of Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk's plans of modernizing the newly formed Republic of Turkey. He started his undergraduate studies in Natural Sciences at Berlin University in 1934, and subsequently completed his doctorate at Bonn University in 1938 under the supervision of Hans Cloos, thus becoming the first native of Turkey with a doctorate degree in geology in the Republic of Turkey. Ketin returned to Turkey in 1938, and started his career as assistant professor at the Geological Institute of Istanbul University. Scientific career Through a faithful coincidence, the long-dormant North Anatolian fault awoke to activity, first gently with the Tercan quake of 21 November 1939, but then violently with the great Erzincan catastrophe of 28 and 29 December 1939, which claimed the lives of some 45,000 people. Ketin rushed to the field with many other geologists, Turkish and foreign, to map the surface breaks and the fearful damage. After Ketin published his paper on the North Anatolian fault, its importance was acknowledged when he was awarded the coveted Gustav- Steinmann-Medaille, the highest distinction the Geologische Vereinigung e.V. gives, in the journal, in which Ketin's paper had been published.Yaltirak C.; Aksu A.E., 2002, Memorial to Ihsan Ketin (1914‚Äì1995), Marine Geology, Volume 190, Number 1, 15 October 2002, pp. 1‚Äì3(3) Sengor, A.M.C.

In 1953, Ketin accepted a new position, the chair in General Geology in the Faculty of Mines at Istanbul Technical University. In 1953, he published his well-known comparison of the San Andreas and North Anatolian faults. Ketin contributed four major papers to the International Tectonic Map of Europe, published in 1960, in which he portrays Turkey as a dominantly asymmetric orogen, accreted from north to south. His tectonic and kinematic views formed the basis for many large-scale tectonic models in Turkey. Ketin retired from active teaching in 1983, but remained in the Department of Geology as professor emeritus until his death in 1995.

It is located by the mouth of the River Tyne, east of Tyninghame, and west of Dunbar. There was a manor at Tyninghame in 1094, and it was later a property of the Lauder of The Bass family. In the 17th century, it was sold to the Earl of Haddington. The present building dates from 1829 when the 9th Earl of Haddington employed William Burn to greatly enlarge the house in the Baronial style. In 1987 the contents of the house were sold, and the house was divided into flats. The house is protected as a category A listed building, and the grounds are included in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland, the national listing of significant gardens. History There was a manor on the lands in 1094, when it was mentioned in a charter of Duncan II of Scotland to the monks of St Cuthberts. From 1250 into the 16th century Tyninghame was held by the Bishops of St Andrews. It was leased to the Lauder family as a winter residence. The Lauders owned The Bass and lived there in the summer. In 1617 the Dowager Lady Bass, Isabella Hepburn (widow of George Lauder of The Bass (died 1611)) made additions to the house.Hannan, p.182 Earls of Haddington In 1628 when Thomas Hamilton, 1st Earl of Haddington received that title in exchange for that of Earl of Melrose he acquired Tyninghame by purchase. His son was killed in an explosion at Dunglass Castle in 1640, and by 1669 the 5th Earl had inherited the property. He married Margaret Leslie, 8th Countess of Rothes, daughter of the Duke of Rothes, and lived mainly on his wife's estate. His son, the 6th Earl, took up residence at Tyninghame following his marriage to Helen Hope around 1700. The couple found the estate in poor condition and set about renovating and replanting. His wife is largely responsible for the layout of the parks which survives today, including avenues, plantations, and the Binning Wood. She named the wood after their son. Inspired by his wife to become a noted agricultural improver, the Earl wrote a book, A Treatise on the Manner of Raising Forest Trees, published in 1761. In 1791 Charles, the 8th Earl, renovated the house, but these were superseded by the works carried out by the 9th Earl. In 1828 he commissioned William Burn to redesign the house in the Scots Baronial style. Burn made only limited alterations to the plan of the house but totally altered the elevations, refacing most of the building in red sandstone, and adding turrets and other details. The original 17th-century masonry can be seen on the south facade. The 9th Earl also carried out further plantings in the parks and erected an obelisk in 1856 to commemorate the work of the 5th Earl. On the death of the 9th Earl in 1858, the estate was inherited by a cousin, George Baillie of Mellerstain. His son, the 11th Earl, carried out further plantings in the 1880s, including the Walled Gardens. Formal gardens, including Lady Haddington's Secret Garden, were established by the 12th Earl and his wife in the 20th century. The house was featured in Country Life on 7 August 1975, and in Scottish Field in August 1953. After the 12th Earl died in 1986, the 13th Earl chose to retain Mellerstain House near Duns, Scottish Borders as his main residence, and Tyninghame was sold the following year. The bulk of the contents were auctioned by Sotheby's in a two-day sale at the house, on 28‚Äì29 September 1987. The house was then divided into apartments by country house developer Kit Martin.

Storing variables in the database (and on other machines on the network) is designed to be simple, requiring no libraries and using the same commands and operators used for working with variables in RAM as with data in persistent storage. Overview There have been several revisions to the MUMPS language standard between 1975 and 1999. The basic language structure has remained constant. The language standard can be viewed at The Annotated M(UMPS) Standards, with examples of use in the online book M(UMPS) by Example. MUMPS was early used for multi-user and multi-tasking work. Today, a PC running MUMPS can behave much as a large minicomputer of former years. Early versions of MUMPS did not require large memory or disk capacities and so were practical on smaller machines than some other systems required. Whitespace In MUMPS syntax, some spaces are significant; they are not merely whitespace. Spaces are used as explicit separators between different syntax elements. For example, a space (called ls in the formal MUMPS standard) separates a tag on a line from the commands that make up that line. Another example is the single space that separates a command from the arguments of that command. If the argument is empty, the command is considered to be \\"argumentless\\". This means this a context in which a pair of spaces has a different syntactic significance than a single space. One space separates the command from its argument, and the second space separates this command from the next command. However, extra spaces may always be added between commands for clarity because in this context the second and more spaces are not syntactically significant, up to the line length limit in an implementation. The end-of-line characters are syntactically significant, as they mark the end of line scope for IF, ELSE, and FOR commands. In contrast to other languages, carriage returns and linefeeds are not the same as white space; they are terminators of a line. Where some languages have a requirement to put semicolons at the end of commands, MUMPS uses the space or line-terminator to end the command. While other languages have larger ways of grouping commands, such as statements and blocks, MUMPS does not have these, only the line scope. Unlike Fortran and some other languages which had fixed-length lines, lines have variable length up to the limit of the implementation. There is no explicit way to extend or continue a line. Procedures ‚Äì MUMPS routines A typical M procedure (a \\"routine\\" in MUMPS terminology) is analogous to a source file in C (in that the subroutines and functions relevant to a particular task or category are grouped together, for instance) and consists of lines of MUMPS code. Line labels can be used to create memory resident subroutines within the routine by starting the line with a label instead of whitespace. The same subroutine can be used from outside the parent routine's scope by referencing the label and routine name separated by a caret character (as in \`SUBRTN^ABC\`). A routine file might look like this (for a routine called 'sampleproc'): sampleproc(z) ; a sample routine write \\"This is a sample procedure\\",! new a,b,c dosets set a=10,b=20,c=30 do subproc(b) if z set c=a+c+z quit c subproc(y) set a=(a+y)*2 quit In this case, labels have been attached to the first, fourth, and eighth lines, creating subroutines within the parent routine. The fifth line makes a subroutine call within the same routine, to a subroutine called 'subproc'. It is also possible for any other program to call that subroutine by fully specifying it, as \`do subproc^sampleproc(argument)\`. Even though the fourth line appears to be a continuation of the subroutine 'sampleproc()', it can still be called from other routines with \`do dosets^sampleproc\`, and execution will continue with the first part of sampleproc() ignored. Even though sampleproc is defined as needing an argument, dosets is not, so you would not pass any arguments to dosets. MUMPS also allows the programmer to jump to an arbitrary line within a subroutine. \`do sampleproc+3^sampleproc\` is equivalent to \`do dosets^sampleproc\`. Variables and datatypes MUMPS does not require declaration of variables, and is untyped: all variables, including numbers, are effectively strings. Using variables in a numeric context (e.g., addition, subtraction) invokes a well-defined conversion in case the string is not a canonical number, such as \\"123 Main Street\\". MUMPS has a large set of string manipulation operators, and its hierarchical variable management system extends to both RAM-based and disk-based variables. Disk resident (i.e., database) variables are automatically stored in hierarchical structures. Most implementations use caching, node indexes and name compression to reduce the time and space cost of disk references. All variables are considered to be sparse arrays. In a MUMPS context, this means that there is no requirement for sequential nodes to exist ‚Äî \`A(1), A(99)\` and \`A(100)\` may be used without defining, allocating space for, or using any space for nodes 2 through 98. Indeed, one can even use floating-point numbers and strings (\`A(1.2)\`, \`A(3.3)\`, \`A(\\"foo\\")\`, etc.), where the subscript names have some meaning external to the program. The access function \`$ORDER ( A(1.2) )\` returns the next defined key or subscript value, 3.3 in this example, so the program can readily manage the data. Subscripts are always returned (and usually stored) in sorted order. Given their sorting and naming features, it's not uncommon for subscripts and variable names to be used as data stores themselves, independent of any data stored at their locations. This feature is often used for database indexes. E.g., \`SET ^INDEX(lastname,firstname,SSNumber)=RecordNum\`. Global variables ‚Äì the database The MUMPS term globals does not refer strictly to unscoped variables, as in the C tradition. MUMPS Globals are variables which are automatically and transparently stored on disk and persist beyond program, routine, or process completion. Globals are used exactly like ordinary variables, but with the caret character prefixed to the variable name. Modifying the earlier example as follows: SET ^A(\\"first_name\\")=\\"Bob\\" SET ^A(\\"last_name\\")=\\"Dobbs\\" results in creation of a new disk record, which is immediately inserted within the file structure of the disk. It is persistent, just as a file persists in most operating systems. Globals are stored in structured data files by MUMPS, and accessed only as MUMPS globals. MUMPS has a long history of cached, journaled, and balanced B-tree key/value disk storage, including transaction control for multiple file transaction 'commit' and 'roll-back' at the language/operating system level. Real-world databases can often grow unpredictably (such as having 20 patients with a last name of 'Anderson' before you get any with surnames starting with 'B'), but modern MUMPS implementations are designed to structure the database efficiently as it grows. For all of these reasons, one of the most common MUMPS applications is database management. MUMPS provides the classic ACID properties as part of any standard MUMPS implementation. FileMan is an example of a DBMS built with MUMPS. The InterSystems Cach√© implementation allows dual views of selected data structures‚Äîas MUMPS globals, or as SQL data‚Äîand has SQL built in (called M/SQL). Variable scoping Since MUMPS's global variables are stored on disk, they are immediately visible to and modifiable by any other running program once they are created. RAM-based variables, called locals are only visible inside the currently running process, and their value is lost when the process exits. The scope of local variables is determined by using the '\`new\`' command to declare the variable. Declaration is optional - an undeclared variable is in scope for all routines running in the same process. A declared variable is accessible at the stack level it was declared, and remains accessible as long as that stack level exists. This means that a called routine has access to the variables available in its calling routine. Using the '\`new\`' command, a routine can redeclare variables its caller might have created, and thus prevent itself from modifying them. It cannot prevent routines it calls from modifying its own variables, so good MUMPS programming practice is to have every routine 'new' the variables it uses. Multi-user, multi-tasking, multi-processor MUMPS allowed multi-user operation at a time when memory was measured in kilobytes, processor time was scarce, and processors themselves were considerably slower than those found today. Many MUMPS implementations included full support for multi-tasking, multi-user, multi-machine programming even when the host operating system itself did not. For instance, a single PC running MUMPS under MS-DOS and equipped with multiple RS232 ports, behaved as a large minicomputer serving multiple ASCII terminals, with proper data sharing and protection. The following code demonstrates how to alter data on other computers on the network: SET ^\\"DENVER\\"A(\\"first_name\\")=\\"Bob\\" SET ^\\"DENVER\\"A(\\"last_name\\")=\\"Dobbs\\" which gives A a value as before, but this time on the remote machine \\"DENVER\\". Another use of MUMPS in more recent times has been to create object databases. The InterSystems Cach√© implementation, for instance, includes such features natively. MUMPS can generate text in HTML or XML format as well, and can be called via the CGI interface to serve web pages directly from the database. It can also be used as a backend for web applications using AJAX background communication.

It was established in 1890, and is the oldest library organization in the State of New Jersey. The NJLA began in 1890 with 39 members, and currently has over 1,700. The organization states on its website that it \\"advocates for the advancement of library services for the residents of New Jersey, provides continuing education & networking opportunities for librarians\\", and \\"supports the principles of intellectual freedom & promotes access to library materials for all\\". History 1890 ‚Äì 1950 On December 29, 1890, 39 charter member libraries formed the New Jersey Library Association and elected their first president, William Prall.Kent 1980, Page 42 Prall, a New Jersey State Assembly member from Passaic County, served as president from 1890‚Äì1891. He had previously introduced the state library law in 1884.Kent 1980, Page 43 The original purpose of the organization was \\"to instill in the minds of assistants a love of work in which they are engaged\\". The organization helped to promote state legislation benefiting libraries, and successfully pushed forward passage of the state Traveling Library Law for rural librarians in 1899.Kent 1980, Page 46 It helped promote the law which established the New Jersey Public Library Commission in 1900. In 1905, the organization helped to set up a summer school for librarians, and in 1922, assisted in the establishment of a \\"graded summer school for library service\\".Kent 1980, Page 45 The organization's publication New Jersey Libraries has appeared continuously in various formats since 1911.Kent 1980, Page 50 In 1927, the NJLA assisted the Public Library Commission in forming a library school at the Douglass College, then known as New Jersey College for Women. 1950 ‚Äì present The NJLA was officially incorporated on April 19, 1951, and structured with an Executive Board to oversee operations.Kent 1980, Page 52 The NJLA has published several studies on the services offered by public and county libraries, including the reports Library Service for the People of New Jersey in 1953, Libraries for the People of New Jersey, or Knowledge for All in 1963,Kent 1980, Page 48 and Interim Goals for a New Jersey Library Development Program in 1977. The Grievance Committee was established by the organization in 1962 to investigate grievances of librarians and maintain professional standards.Kent 1980, Page 44 The Intellectual Freedom Committee was established in the same year, and acts against censorship. The Intellectual Freedom Committee has presented testimony before New Jersey state committees, in opposition to legislation regulating obscenity and pornography. In October 1976, the association passed a resolution that all \\"future publications and official documents of NJLA avoid terminology which perpetuates sex stereotyping, and that existent publications and official documents, as they are revised, be changed to avoid such terminology\\".Kent 1980, Page 54 In 1991, the organization sponsored Books for Kids, a statewide program which encourages children to read by themselves. The NJLA supported the American Library Association's position in challenging the 2001 Children's Internet Protection Act, which mandates public libraries install pornography filters on computers with Internet access in order for the libraries to receive federal funding. The Act was upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States in a 2003 decision. \\"Obviously we feel it's a very difficult decision to implement. There's no guidance on how to implement it. There's a lot of confusion about what's going to happen and what requirements would have to be followed if federal funds were obtained,\\" said NJLA executive director Patricia Tumulty in a statement about the decision to The Star- Ledger. Tumulty said that the law would disproportionately affect libraries with less available funding. In 2002, the NJLA and corporate sponsor, the Verizon Foundation, started the nonprofit charity program New Jersey Reads to encourage literacy among the 2 million people in New Jersey who have trouble reading. New Jersey Reads was started with US$325,000 in funding from Verizon. In 2003, the NJLA organized a seminar for approximately 150 librarians, educating them on how to protect readers' privacy in light of the USA PATRIOT Act. \\"We are grappling with this ‚Äì we are a country at war and everyone wants to be patriotic, but they're forgetting the First Amendment,\\" said one librarian who attended the convention. The association organizes the One Book New Jersey program, and chooses one book for each age group to promote literacy. In 2003, then-First Lady Dina Matos McGreevey was the spokeswoman for One Book New Jersey. One Book New Jersey was developed by the NJLA and the New Jersey State Library. Recognition In 1977, the American Library Association presented the NJLA with the annual Grolier Award, which recognizes the \\"best public relations program promoting public library use\\". In its entry describing the association in the Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science, the encyclopedia notes: \\"Whatever will be accomplished, it may be prophesied without fear or contradiction that the NJLA will stand in the front row when a tally is taken of effective and steadfast library supporters.\\" See also * American Library Association * List of library associations * New Jersey State Library * New Jersey Digital Highway Notes References * External links *New Jersey Library Association Category:Organizations established in 1890 Category:Organizations based in New Jersey Category:Trenton, New Jersey ","title":"New Jersey Library Association"},{"id":"17634664","text":"UMTS Forum is an open cross sector and independent organization founded on 16 December 1996 in Z√ºrich, Switzerland, as a non-profit association under Swiss law with the aim to enhance the modular 3G/UMTS concept, which takes full regard of the trend of convergence of existing and future information networks, devices and services, and the potential synergies that can be derived from such convergence.

Biography Mailla was born at Ch√¢teau Maillac on the Is√®re. After finishing his studies, he joined the Society of Jesus in 1686, and, in 1701, was sent on a mission to China as a member of the Jesuits. In June, 1703, Father Mailla arrived in Morocco and thence set out for Canton where he acquired a thorough knowledge of Chinese language and writing. He devoted himself particularly to the study of Chinese historical works. When the Kangxi Emperor entrusted the Jesuit missionaries with the cartographical survey of his empire, the provinces of Henan, Zhejiang, and Fujian, and the Island of Formosa, fell to the lot of Mailla along with Jean-Baptiste R√©gis and Roman Hinderer. When the work had been completed, the emperor conferred on Father Mailla the rank of mandarin as a mark of his satisfaction. When Father Mailla died, in his seventy-ninth year, in Beijing, China, he was buried at the expense of the Qianlong Emperor, many people being present at the obsequies. Works When he was fifty years old he began the study of the Manchu language, and made such progress that he was able to translate into French the \\"Thoung-kian-kang- mou\\" (),Chinese Literature: Tongjian gangmu ÈÄöÈëëÁ∂±ÁõÆ Zhu Xi's extract from the great Chinese annals,Yves Camus, \\"Jesuits‚Äô Journeys in Chinese Studies\\" \\"An Historical and Descriptive Account of China: Its Ancient and Modern ...\\", by Hugh Murray, John Crawfurd, Peter Gordon. 1843. Page 37. On Google Books which on the orders of the Kangxi Emperor had been translated into the Manchu language. He finished the translation in several volumes in the year 1730, and in 1737 sent it to France, where it lay for thirty years in the library of the college at Lyon, Fr√©ret, who purposed publishing it, having died. After the suppression of the Jesuit order, the college authorities gave the manuscript to the Abb√© Grosier on condition that he would see to the publication of the work. Not long after, the work appeared under the title: \\"Histoire g√©n√©rale de la Chine, ou Annales de cet Empire; traduit du Tong-kien-kang-mou par de Mailla, Paris, 1777-1783\\",Mailla's spelling, Tong-kien-kang-mou, is given by numerous sources, e.g. Alfred Owen Aldridge, \\"The Dragon and the Eagle: The Presence of China in the American Enlightenment\\", Wayne State University Press, 1993, (Partial view on Google Books) , page 18. The 1907 Catholic Encyclopedia misspells it as Tong-kiere-kang-mou (sic). in 12 volumes, with maps and plans. In 1785 a thirteenth volume followed. Besides Grosier, the Orientalists Deshauterayes and Colson were mainly responsible for the publication. Translator Mailla is also the first European scholar to whom we owe a detained knowledge of the Shujing, the classic historical work of the Chinese, most of its books being included in his translation. Mailla, also, in order to promote the work of the mission, compiled some edifying books in Chinese; the most important being lives of the saints, and meditations on the Gospels of the Sundays throughout the whole year. In Lettres √©difiantes there are some letters from him on the persecution of the Christians which took place in China during his time. Significance Being based on the Confucian orthodox text of Zhu Xi, Mailla's Histoire g√©n√©rale gives an idealised account of Chinese imperial history, which should also be read in context of the Rites controversy. For the time being it remained a sole source on Chinese history available in Europe. As a result, eighteenth-century Enlightenment leaders discussed China as an example of an ideal secular monarchy, a biased vision supported by Voltaire and opposed by Montesquieu.

The Battle of Romania is covered by the blue area. The Battle of Romania in World War II comprised several operations in or around Romania in 1944, as part of the Eastern Front, in which the Soviet Army defeated Axis (German and Romanian) forces in the area, Romania changed sides, and Soviet and Romanian forces drove the Germans back into Hungary. In the First Jassy‚ÄìKishinev Offensive, the Soviet Army attacked into Romania from the northeast, through the territory of present-day Moldova. Named after the two major cities Ia»ôi (Jassy) and Chi»ôinƒÉu (Kishinev) in the area, a series of military engagements took place between 8 April and 6 June with the objective of cutting off vital Axis defensive lines in Northern Romania, facilitating a subsequent advance by the Red Army into the entire Balkan region. Soviet forces failed to overcome German defenses in the region and the offensive operation ultimately failed, mainly due to the poor combat performance of Soviet troops and the effectiveness of German defensive preparations. The second major attack of the offensive, between 20 August and 29 August, was a Soviet victory.United Center for Research and Training in History, Bulgarian historical review, p.7 The German Sixth Army was encircled by the initial Soviet onslaught and was destroyed for the second time. On 23 August, King Michael of Romania led a coup d'√©tat against Prime Minister Ion Antonescu; the new government surrendered to the Allies and declared war on Germany. Romanian historian Florin Constantiniu claims this shortened World War II in Europe by six months. Constantiniu, Florin, O istorie sincerƒÉ a poporului rom√¢n (\\"An Honest History of the Romanian People\\"), Ed. Univers Enciclopedic, Bucure»ôti, 1997, The Axis front collapsed. In the north, the German Eighth Army retreated to Hungary with heavy losses. Elsewhere, many Germans were cut off and captured, such as the large security and anti-aircraft force posted at the Ploie»ôti oil field. Other fragments of the German forces fled toward Hungary as best they could, fighting the Romanians and Soviet forces, which stormed through the Carpathian Mountains. (Several passes through the mountains were held by Romanian troops.) The Soviet victory in Romania caused Bulgaria to withdraw from the Axis on 26 August, and allowed Soviet forces to invade it on 8 September. By 24 September, nearly all of Romania was under Allied control. Historian David Glantz asserts that the Soviets launched a First Jassy‚ÄìKishinev Offensive in this area between 8 April and 6 June. This attack failed.Glantz, pp. 371-376  References  Romania Romania Romania Category:Military history of Romania during World War II Romania Category:Romania‚ÄìSoviet Union relations Romania Romania Category:German‚ÄìRomania military relations fi:Romanian taistelu ","title":"Battle of Romania"},{"id":"17634971","text":"Shorncliffe Camp can refer to: * Shorncliffe Redoubt ‚Äì a British Napoleonic earthwork fort * Shorncliffe Army Camp ‚Äì a large military establishment in Cheriton, Kent, UK * Folkestone West railway station ‚Äì a British railway station opened in 1863 as \\"Shorncliffe Camp\\" ","title":"Shorncliffe Camp"},{"id":"17634990","text":"Edward Joseph \\"Ted\\" Flemming (30 October 1902, date of death unknown) was an Australian rules footballer who played 229 games for West Perth in the WAFL/WANFL from 1922 to 1938.

Established in 1794, it later served as a staging post for troops destined for the Western Front during the First World War. History Map dated 1801 showing Shorncliffe Redoubt on the left and the camp ground on the right The camp was established in 1794 when the British Army bought over 229 acres of land at Shorncliffe; it was then extended in 1796 and 1806. It was at Shorncliffe that in 1803 Sir John Moore trained the Light Division that fought under the Duke of Wellington in the Napoleonic Wars. In 1890 hutted camp facilities were replaced with permanent facilities known as Moore Barracks, Napier Barracks, Ross Barracks, Royal Engineers Barracks (later known as Burgoyne Barracks) and Somerset Barracks. Risborough Barracks were established by 1910. Shorncliffe was used as a staging post for troops destined for the Western Front during the First World War and in April 1915 a Canadian Training Division was formed there. The Canadian Army Medical Corps had general hospitals based at Shorncliffe from September 1917 to December 1918. The camp at that time composed five unit lines known as Moore Barracks, Napier Barracks, Risborough Barracks, Ross Barracks and Somerset Barracks. On three occasions there were German air raids which killed soldiers on the camp. During the Second World War Shorncliffe was again used as a staging post and Queen Mary visited the camp in 1939. From 1967 the camp was home to the Junior Infantryman's Battalion (JIB) and later, the Infantry Junior Leaders Battalion (IJLB) until the dissolution of junior soldier recruitment in 1991. The Royal Gurkha Rifles have been based at Sir John Moore Barracks, Shorncliffe since 2001. 2 (South East) Brigade was also based in Sir John Moore Barracks until January 2015. In November 2016 Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon announced in the House of Commons that Somerset Barracks is to close. The Shorncliffe System The units stationed here during the Napoleonic wars greatly affected military history from this point onward. The light infantry trained at Shorncliffe were a new breed of soldier more akin to the soldiers of the modern British Army than their contemporaries. Using the \\"Shorncliffe Method\\", devised by Lt-Col Kenneth Mackenzie, the soldiers were taught to think for themselves and act on initiative. A high proportion of them were literate, which was unusual for the time. Moreover, in an age when many officers received no training, the light infantry officers drilled with the men. Their battlefield tactics were the embryonic emergence of current military manoeuvres, often fighting in skirmish formation ahead of the British main battle line.David Gates, ‚ÄòMackenzie, Kenneth (later Sir Kenneth Douglas, first baronet) (1754‚Äì1833)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004.

Louis-Nicolas Bescherelle (; 10 June 1802, in Paris ‚Äì 4 February 1883, in Paris) was a French lexicographer and grammarian. With help from his brother Henri (1804 - 1887), he wrote Le V√©ritable Manuel des conjugaisons ou la science des conjugaisons mise √† la port√©e de tout le monde (Paris: D√©p√¥t central des publications classiques, 1842), a reference guide to French verb conjugation, in 1842. Louis-Nicolas, this time working alone, followed up six years later with L'Art de conjuguer, ou Simples mod√®les de conjugaisons pour tous les verbes de la langue fran√ßaise (Paris: Librairie eccl√©siastique et classique de √âdouard Tetu et Cie, 1848). This covered much the same ground as Le V√©ritable Manuel, but with a simpler and clearer presentation: 215 model conjugations set out in table form, followed by an alphabetical list of around 6,500 verbs keyed to the models. While the Le V√©ritable Manuel enjoyed considerable success, it was L'Art de conjuguer that became the staple for students of French. It went through scores of editions under this title until the 1990s, when it was renamed Bescherelle: La conjugaison pour tous in France (it continued to be published as L'Art de conjuguer in other Francophone territories, notably Quebec). The most recent edition was published by √âditions Hatier in 2012. A new edition has been announced for 2019. The book became so important that his last name is used as a noun to refer to any French conjugation book (\\"a Bescherelle\\").

Plants and Wildlife The Pacific Northwest climate allows for many diverse species of plants and animals to thrive. Along with the flora and fauna indigenous to Oregon in general, the ones that are more specific to Yamhill county are categorized as wildlife species of the northwest region. This list contains animals in four different categories including amphibians, birds, mammals, and reptiles. Surprisingly enough, Wolverines have also recently been discovered in the Oregon territory as well, though their populations seem to be very small. Oregon Conservation Efforts The ODFW in Yamhill county is taking necessary steps toward the conservation of some of the indigenous plant and animal species. Some of the plants and animals listed on the endangered species are: the marbled murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus), the Northern Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis caurina). Some of the endangered plants are, the Willamette daisy (Erigeron decumbens var. decumbens), the Kincaid's Lupine (Lupinus sulphureus ssp. Kincaidii), and the Nelson's Checker-Mallow( Sidalcea nelsoniana ), to name a few.

It is relatively level with a gradual incline, until the last 100 m which is decidedly steeper. The rock sits at the end of the path, just over the incline. The Erratic Park area also provides a venue for participating in some of the more popular hobbies related to the area. The hobbies include birding, butterfly collecting, photography, and geocaching. Birding Birdwatchers will find a lot of resources for their hobby in Yamhill county. There are a number of bird watching sites in Yamhill county, and Erratic is one of them. For a complete list of popularly viewed Oregon birds, see the Oregon Birds checklist online. For more information on additional connection opportunities and notifications on rare bird alerts, more information is online. Butterfly collecting Butterfly collectors will find many different species of butterflies in the Erratic area. Some of the species include, swallowtails (Papilioninae), parnassians (Parnassiinae), whites (Pierinae), sulphurs (Coliadinae), and more. A butterfly species, the Fender's blue butterfly, can also be viewed in this area. It is, however, on the endangered species list, so should not be collected. A large collection of indigenous Oregon butterflies can be seen at the Jackson Bottom Wetlands Preserve to serve as a documentation of everything Oregon has to offer. Collection of animals and plants is not permitted within Oregon's state parks. Photography The opportunities for photography vary from nature-focused to landscape. Geocaching Tanglebox Geocaching is an outdoor recreational treasure hunt. Cache availability and sizes are dependent on those who place and maintain them.

She became the Ukrainian Girls' (under 20) champion at 15 years. Many of her chess skills have been self-taught, although in 2000‚Äì2002, she studied chess in the Kharkiv sports school of Olympic reserve. During this period, her coach was International Master Artiom Tsepotan. Afterwards she received more coaching at a specialist facility in Kramatorsk. National success At the national Ukrainian Women's Championship, her progress and achievements have been noteworthy. In 2003 (Mykolaiv) and 2004 (Alushta), she finished in fourth and sixth places respectively, thereafter becoming the champion at Alushta in 2005, and outperforming top seed Tatjana Vasilevich along the way.

The Swan Boats have been in operation since 1877, and have since become a cultural icon for the city. They operate beginning the second weekend of April and ending the third weekend in September. History Robert Paget first created the Swan Boats in the Public Garden in 1877, after seeing the opera Lohengrin with his wife Julia Paget. Inspired by the knight's gallant rescue of the damsel by riding a swan across the lake, Paget decided to capitalize on the recent popularity of the bicycle and combine the two, designing a two-pontooned boat with two wooden benches and a brass seat on top of a paddlebox concealed by a swan. The driver would sit inside the swan and pedal passengers around the pond. Swan boats have since operated every year until 2020, when they stayed closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Massachusetts.Swan Boats Will Not Operate This Year For First Time In Its History  Current design  To this day, the design for the Swan Boat has changed very little. The boats have been periodically replaced throughout the years, and the current fleet operates with six boats. Each boat has kept the original design, with two pontoons, a brass seat atop a paddlebox concealed by a fiberglass swan, and wooden benches for passengers. However, more rows of benches have been added over the years. Five of the boats have six rows, each row holding about three to four adults, and the oldest boat has five rows, which seat two to three adults each. The boats range in age from roughly twenty to over ninety years old. The oldest boat in operation was built in 1918,http://www.swanboats.com/history and the newest was built in 1995.  Current operation The Swan Boats operate in the same pond in the Public Garden in which they have operated for over 140 years. A Swan Boat ride is a peaceful experience, usually lasting about 12‚Äì15 minutes. Each boat is powered solely by a driver, often a high school or college student, who pedals the boat like a bicycle. The boats are steered by pulling one of two ropes connected to a series of pulleys and a rudder. The Swan Boats remain a Boston tradition and symbol of the city. The Swan Boats are famed for their appearance in the stories of Make Way For Ducklings and The Trumpet of the Swan, and are often noted in tourist guides and other books about the city. In 1954 service was interrupted during the summer for the first time, when city officials drained the lake after 30 ducks died due to an infection.

The house is built of coursed squared gritstone and ashlar with grey slate and stone slate roofs. A central 2-storey block is flanked by a tower at one end and a 3-storey wing at the other. A gatehouse which stands some to the south of the main buildings is also Grade I listed, whilst the two weirs over Ripley Beck (and the bridges that straddle them) are grade II listed and the grounds and gardens are also listed at grade II. The castle has been the seat of the Ingilby baronets for centuries.  History  Sir Thomas Ingleby (c. 1290-1352) married the heiress Edeline Thwenge in 1308/9 and acquired the Ripley Castle estate with its medieval manor house as her dowry. His oldest son, also called Thomas (1310‚Äì1369), saved the king from being gored by a wild boar whilst on a hunting expedition and was knighted in return with the boar's head symbol as his crest. Sir John Ingleby (1434‚Äì1499) inherited the estate from his father at the age of five and built the castle gatehouse, before becoming a monk at Mount Grace Priory, near Northallerton, and later the Bishop of Llandaff. His son Sir William Ingleby was raised by his deserted mother. Sir John's grandson, Sir William Ingleby (1518‚Äì1578), was High Sheriff of Yorkshire in 1564‚Äì65. Sir William added the tower to the building in 1548. Two of his sons were fervent Catholics on the run from the authorities. Francis, a priest, was caught, sentenced and hanged, drawn and quartered in York in 1586; David escaped to die on the Continent. Sir William Ingleby (1546‚Äì1618) was knighted by James VI of Scotland when the king was en route to his coronation as James I of England in 1603.John Nichols, The Progresses, Processions, and Magnificent Festivities of King James the First, vol. 1 (London, 1828), p. 82. Later that year he captured one of the fugitive brothers of the Earl of Gowrie at Kirkby Malzeard.HMC Salisbury Hatfield, vol. 15 (London, 1930), pp. 376-7. In 1605 he was involved in the Gunpowder Plot, allowing the plotters to stay at Ripley whilst they procured horses. One of the conspirators, Robert Winter was his nephew. Ingleby was arrested and charged with treason, but acquitted. Sir William Ingleby (1594‚Äì1652) supported Charles I during the Civil War, and was made Baronet Ingleby in 1642. He fought at Marston Moor in 1644, when the King's forces were totally routed, making his escape to Ripley and hiding in a priest hole while Oliver Cromwell billeted himself there for the night. His son, yet another William, 2nd Baronet (1620‚Äì1682) was very religious and managed to get the family‚Äôs entire fortune captured by rebels. On the death of the 4th Baronet in 1772 the baronetcy became extinct but was revived in 1781 for his illegitimate son John (1758‚Äì1815). Ripley Castle in 2008 Sir John undertook a major rebuild of the castle in 1783‚Äì86 by William Belwood but got into debt and fled overseas in 1794 for several years whilst timber from the estate was sold to raise money. He was High Sheriff for 1782‚Äì83 and MP for East Retford from 1790 to 1796. His son William (1783‚Äì1854) was a great eccentric, drinker and gambler and Member of Parliament (MP) for East Retford from 1807 to 1812 and High Sheriff in 1821. He adopted the surname of Amcotts- Ingilby (his mother was Elizabeth Amcotts) and demolished and rebuilt the village of Ripley, complete with a Continental-style h√¥tel de ville. Having no heir he left the Ripley estate to his first cousin, Henry John Ingilby. The baronetcy was extinguished a second time. Henry was created 1st Baronet Ingilby of the third creation in 1866. Ripley then descended to the present 6th Baronet. The castle is still privately owned but open to the public for guided tours. The Yorkshire Television children's series The Flaxton Boys (1969‚Äì1973) used Ripley Castle as the fictional Flaxton Hall. It was used in the 1976 Disney film Escape from the Dark, as the home of Lord Harrogate, played by Alastair Sim. The BBC Television series Gunpowder (2017) used the castle as a location.

The band was formed in 1994 after splitting from Nar Mataron, and was soon signed to Black Lotus Records, with whom they released four studio albums. Moving through numerous line-ups, the band has seen influences from other genres of music, including a traditional black metal release and songs featuring elements of melodic black metal and industrial music. In 2007, the band signed with Season of Mist, with whom they released their most recent album. The current line-up includes founding member bassist Kaiadas, former DHG vocalist Vicotnic, and drummer Warhead. The band has been labeled as part of the National Socialist black metal scene, although it is not typically labeled as such. The connection to the scene is drawn chiefly due to the activities of Kaiadas, real name Giorgos Germenis, who was formerly a member of the National Socialist black metal band Der St√ºrmer and who held a seat in the Greek parliament as a member of the far-right and neo-fascist criminal organization Golden Dawn. The band also, in 2017, performed at the festival Asgardsrei. History Naer Mataron was formed in 1994 from Nar Mataron. Nar Mataron had formed earlier that year, and after the release of two demos, Tales of the Twelve Gods and The Awakening of Ancient Greece, the band split in two. The vocalist, Lord Alatoth, carried on with Nar Mataron, while guitarist/bassist Morpheas, with fellow Naer Mataron member Kaiadas, formed Naer Mataron, leading to accusations from Lord Alatoth that Naer Mataron had stolen his songs and band name. Naer Mataron refers to this early period in its history by saying there were \\"line up changes and personal conflicts\\" before its first release. Morpheas took on vocal duties, and the band's first promo, \\"The Great God Pan\\", was released in 1997, leading to a deal with Black Lotus Records. Before the release of the band's first album the following year, Aither joined the band as the vocalist/drummer, and then Aither and Morpheas each left the band. Naer Mataron's first full-length album, Up from the Ashes, featured Efialtis on vocals, Kaiadas on bass and Lethe (session) on drums. Aither subsequently rejoined the band as vocalist, appearing on the 2000 release Skotos Aenaon (which translates from Ancient Greek as \\"endless darkness\\"), and then took on drumming duties (moving Lethe to keyboards) when Morpheas returned to the band. Despite the line-up changes, Naer Mataron remained extremely active in terms of performances, and opened for several major black metal acts, including Mayhem and Rotting Christ. In 2001, the band produced a 7\\" vinyl EP named A Holocaust in Front of God's Eyes in a one-off deal with Aphelion Productions. The release was limited to 500 copies, and the band intended it to be \\"old school black metal\\", in contrast with their usual style. This was followed by 2003's River at Dash Scalding, recorded at Praxis Studio, featuring faster and heavier drum work from official drummer Warhead. Warhead has been credited as \\"the fastest drummer on the continent\\", and has been described by the band as \\"an inspiration\\" with \\"inexhaustible talent\\". The album was given 2.5 out of 5 by Eduardo Rivadavia of Allmusic, who said that \\"Naer Mataron are bound to convert a few additional fans to their cause, but casual metal fans are likely to emerge from this aural lambasting somewhat nonplussed.\\" Following the release, Naer Mataron performed with bands including Rotting Christ and Gorgoroth. 2004 saw several releases. Aghibasiin- Lessons on How To Defeat Death was a collection of demos and unreleased tracks compiled by Shadow Face Records, limited to 1000 copies, while Up from the Ashes and River at Dash Scalding both saw limited edition rereleases. 2004 also saw performances with Dissection, and the headlining of the Winter Storm Festival in Bulgaria. In early 2004, Nordvargr, who had previously written music for River at Dash Scalding, joined the band. The band then recorded Discipline Manifesto, both in Athens, Greece and Oslo, Norway. Released by Black Lotus Records, the album was described as \\"amazing, absolutely amazing\\" by Vampire Magazine, with the atmosphere, vocals and music all being praised. In May 2006, Morpheas left the band and moved to Norway, and was replaced by DHG's Vicotnik, who had previously worked with the band on Discipline Manifesto. In March 2007, it emerged that the band had signed with Season of Mist, and Naer Mataron was quote by Blabbermouth.net as saying\\\\- > The last period was really victorious for NAER MATARON. We composed the > harshest and most extreme music we ever had for our new album. So the next > big step was taken, as we are now proud to announce our signing to Season of > Mist. We are more strong and enthusiastic than ever before and feel that we > are also supported henceforth in the same spirit. To this point, we wish to > extend our salute to the hordes that supported our black metal war machine > throughout the last 13 years and especially thank Michael and Season of Mist > for giving us the chance to deliver what will be the most extreme and > uncompromising work of NAER MATARON to date. Naer Mataron's first release with Season of Mist, Praetorians, was released in 2008. The album was received positively, with Roel De Haan of Lords of Metal saying it \\"is tightly executed, has an icy production, the works\\", but that the album is lacking punch and truly memorable moments\\", giving the album a score of seventy out of one hundred. The current line-up is Kaiadas on bass, Warhead on drums, Nordvargr as producer, Vicotnik as vocalist and Indra on guitars. Since the Greek legislative election of May 2012, Kaiadas, or Giorgos Germenis from his real name, has been elected as a member of the Greek Parliament with the nationalist far-right Golden Dawn party. He was taken to custody in January 2014 on charges of joining and directing a criminal organization. He was released in the summer of 2015. Musical style Naer Mataron play extreme black metal with strong lyrical influences from Greek mythology, which has led to their style being referred to as \\"Hellenic Black Metal\\". The band's music uses instruments standard to black metal- with guitars, bass guitars, drums and keyboards all used.

I think I remain to this day an unbelieving Anglican. None of this is rational, or particularly logical. It is how religion happens: a heap of childhood influence, a questing mind as the search begins, a failure to find new or surprising answers, a sound respect for the minds that once shaped doctrine and then the settling for a quiet and untroubled agnosticism. It is merely a timid temperament that inhibits me from declaring a bold, defiant atheism. Mine has been an outlook evolved from its time, growing from a particular period of history of absolutes and certainties. Everything shifted for devoutly held faith when schools began teaching comparative religion. From then on, the game was up.

If we do this, we are forced to the conclusion that, in a behavioural sense, religious activities consist of the coming together of large groups of people to perform repeated and prolonged submissive displays to appease a dominant individual. The dominant individual takes many forms in different cultures, but always has the common factor of immense power. [...] If these submissive actions are successful, the dominant individual is appeased. [...] The dominant individual is usually, but not always, referred to as a god. Since none of these gods exist in a tangible form, why have they been invented? To find the answer to this we have to go right back to our ancestral origins.\\" Desmond Morris, The Naked Ape, pp. 178‚Äì179, Jonathan Cape, 1967.\\"Man's evolution as a neotenous ape has put him in a similar position to the dog's.

Like real parents they would both protect, punish and be obeyed. [...] These ‚Äî the houses of the gods ‚Äî the temples, the churches and the cathedrals ‚Äî are buildings apparently made for giants, and a space visitor would be surprised to find on closer examination that these giants are never at home.

ÔºàÂÆãÂêõÊ¶ÆÔºâ He had taken Dominique Parrenin's place as head of the school in which Manchus were taught Latin, to act as interpreters in Russian affairs.

Works His works are numerous. Among them is \\"Trait√© de l'Astronomie Chinoise\\" in the \\"Observations math√©matiques\\", published by √âtienne Souciet (Paris, 1729‚Äì1732).

History A commission on national education was appointed on 30 December 1958 which recommended the four years of education from grade IX to XII as part of the intermediate and secondary education curricula thus forming the Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education in Hyderabad in 1961. The move came as part of the West Pakistan Intermediate and Secondary Education Ordinance, 1961 (alternatively for East Pakistan, it was the East Pakistan Ordinance No. XXXIII of 1961). The ordinance was further amended in Act no. XVI of 1962 and Act no. XVII of 1977. Under the acts, it was responsible for the organization to regulate, supervise, control and develop the levels and status of Intermediate and Secondary level public examinations in educational institutions. The board started acting under the guidance of Dr G. A. Jafri, appointed as the board's chairman. Soon afterwards, the board was further bifurcated into a board for Sukkur and recently for Mirpur Khas. Administration The board is run by a group of directors who appoint a chairperson (currently Dr Muhammad Memon), a secretary (currently ) and a controller (Dr.Masroor Ahmed Zai). Organisation As an organisation, the board has developed in the recent years a 202 members strong staff and is equipped with offices in Latifabad U8. The board also owns a stadium in Latifabad used for league, inter-club and -city hockey tournaments. But sporting events The District Hockey Association (DHA) for the Hyderabad District, Pakistan had allocated a budget of 1.6 million rupees for renovations for the betterment of hockey arenas but were reluctant to give the board their share. However, recent endeavours towards bringing the National Hockey Championship back to Hyderabad have been welcomed by quite a few government officials. Recently enough the 54th National Hockey Championships were brought to the stadium and the DHA officials pronounced better conditions.

DeSmogBlog opposes what it describes as \\"a well-funded and highly organized public relations campaign\\" that it says is \\"poisoning\\" the climate change debate. The site was co-founded by James Hoggan, president of a public relations firm based in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Content Mission and audience The blog was co-founded in January 2006 by James Hoggan, president of the public relations firm Hoggan and Associates. In a February 2007 interview with the Vancouver Sun, Hoggan conveys his anger at industry interests who he believes mislead the public about the scientific understanding of global warming. He referred to this alleged misrepresentation of the facts as, \\"public relations at its sleaziest\\". Hoggan used his public relations skills to start a blog that would \\"clear the PR pollution that clouds the science of climate change\\" and expose organizations and individuals which he considered to be unethical. DeSmogBlog says it reports on the credibility of experts who appear to misrepresent the science of global warming in the media by investigating their scientific background, funding sources, and industry interests. The site originally targeted a Canadian audience but is now involved in global climate change coverage. Contributors to the site assist in researching organizations that the site's staff believe are phony, grassroots organizations, or astroturf groups sponsored directly or indirectly by industries seeking to thwart climate change-related legislation. Organizations alleged by the blog to be astroturfs include Friends of Science, Natural Resources Stewardship Project, Global Climate Coalition, and International Climate Science Coalition. Individuals that the site has identified as pushing an anti-climate change point of view are listed in the site's \\"Denial Database\\", with accompanying information about their industry affiliations and professional biographies. In a Financial Post column, Canadian environmentalist Lawrence Solomon stated that the organization was, in Solomon's words, \\"specifically created for the purpose of discrediting skeptics.\\" In a 2007 report in The Globe and Mail, Hoggan stated that the most frequent visitors to the site came from Calgary, Ottawa, and Washington D.C. Notable issues or media mentions In one instance, the site responded to a 2006 open letter opposing the Canadian Government's climate-change plans, claimed to be signed by \\"accredited experts in climate and related scientific disciplines\\", by analyzing the list of the signatories. The site concluded that those checked had few peer-reviewed publications on the topic and/or had fossil-fuel industry connections. DeSmogBlog has criticized Financial Post editor and columnist Terence Corcoran, claiming he impedes progress on climate change and environmental protection legislation in Canada. In turn, Corcoran has criticized Hoggan and his website, accusing both of serving the interests of large corporations hoping to make money on emissions trading. The blog has been referenced in The Guardian by George Monbiot, who most recently cited a study by the website showing that in 2008 \\"the number of internet pages proposing that man-made global warming is a hoax or a lie more than doubled\\". In another column, Monbiot noted that DeSmogBlog posted a video critical of Anthony Watts's blog Watts Up With That that Watts had deleted from YouTube for copyright reasons. Monbiot has also mentioned DeSmogBlog's efforts to expose efforts by oil, coal, and electricity companies to manipulate media views on climate change. Heartland Institute documents In February 2012, DeSmogBlog posted a number of internal documents purportedly from The Heartland Institute, a libertarian think tank. According to a statement posted on the Heartland Institute website, \\"Some of these documents were stolen from Heartland, at least one is a fake, and some may have been altered ... the authenticity of those documents has not been confirmed.\\" Days after the document posting, blogger and journalist Megan McArdle wrote on The Atlantic website of a comment to a blog post that suggested that one of the documents, a memo titled \\"2012 Heartland Climate Strategy,\\" was likely a fake based on the document being a scan which included metadata with a US west coast time zone. DeSmogBog responded that they had \\"no evidence supporting Heartland's claim that the Strategic document is fake\\" and then included a number of references to McArdle's first piece on the topic. McArdle then said of the DeSmogBlog response that \\"The first two links are to my post, and they are an egregious misrepresentation of what I said,\\" and goes on to note that \\"the stubborn willingness to ignore obvious problems becomes the story.\\" On February 20, 2012, Peter Gleick issued a statement in the Huffington Post explaining that he had received an anonymous document in the mail that seemed to contain details on the climate program strategy of The Heartland Institute. He admitted to soliciting and receiving additional material from the Institute \\"under someone else's name,\\" calling his actions \\"a serious lapse of my own and professional judgment and ethics.\\" Founder and staff The site's co- founder, James Hoggan, is President of the Vancouver-based public relations firm James Hoggan & Associates, chair of the David Suzuki Foundation, a trustee of the Dalai Lama Center for Peace and Education, and an executive member of the Urban Development Institute. He is the author (with Richard Littlemore) of the 2009 book Climate Cover-Up: The Crusade to Deny Global Warming (), which criticizes global warming denial and conspiracy theories. The sources do not identify the site's other co-founder. The website names John Lefebvre as a benefactor. Frequent contributors to the blog include Ross Gelbspan and Richard Littlemore. Littlemore is a science writer who formerly worked for the Vancouver Sun. The site's project manager was Kevin Grandia, who left to become the Director of Online Strategy at Greenpeace . As of 2018 the site is now managed by Brendan DeMelle. Awards The site was recognized in December 2007 by three British Columbia chapters of the Canadian Public Relations Society, the Vancouver, Victoria (CPRS-vi) and Northern Lights in Prince George, with an award for demonstrating \\"The highest ethical and professional standards while performing outstanding work\\". In a CPRS press release which accompanied the award, Hoggan stated that the site had been viewed by 520,000 people over its history, had been cited as a source by 24 media outlets, and mentioned in more than 4,500 other blogs. According to the press release, the blog was selected for the award by a panel of journalists and public relations professionals in Victoria, Vancouver, and Prince George. DeSmogBlog was also listed by Time magazine as one of the \\"best blogs of 2011\\" in June 2011.

During the Thirty Years' War several Imperial states established military tribunals modelled on the jurisdiction of the Swedish Army. In Brandenburg-Prussia, justice was dispensed by special Auditeur attorneys through three official channels. After the Prussian-led Unification of Germany, the German Empire with effect from 1 October 1900 established a particular court-martial jurisdiction () to try soldiers of the German Army, with the Reichsmilit√§rgericht (RMG) in Charlottenburg as the supreme court. In Prussia it replaced the Generalauditoriat agency, while the Kingdom of Bavaria retained the right to pass judgements to members of the Bavarian Army by a separate (the 3rd) senate. The presiding judge in the rank of a general or admiral was appointed directly by the German Emperor. During World War I, German military law enabled military courts to try not only soldiers but also civilians held to have violated the military law. Especially well-known is the case of Edith Cavell, an English nurse who was court- martialled and executed in German-occupied Brussels in 1915 for having helped British POW's escape - which was indeed a capital offence under the German military law of the time. Cavell also stood charged with perfidy for having supposedly used the legal protection provided by her position in the International Red Cross as a cover for belligerent activity during wartime.  During Nazi Germany  Memorial plaque in front of the former Reichskriegsgericht building In the post-World War I Weimar Republic (1919-1933), separate courts-martial including the RMG were abolished by Article 106 of the Weimar Constitution, but were revived by the Nazi government after they seized power during the Machtergreifung, enacting a special law on 12 May 1933. Initially the Reichsgericht in Leipzig, from 1 December 1934 the \\"People's Court\\" (Volksgerichtshof) in Berlin, acted as final appellate court, until the Reichskriegsgericht (RKG) was established as high court of the Wehrmacht armed forces by another directive with effect from 1 October 1936. The Reichskriegsgericht was based in the former RMG building on Witzlebenstra√üe in the Charlottenburg district of Berlin. A directive on a special criminal law of war was already enacted on 17 August 1938 by OKW chief Wilhelm Keitel at the behest of F√ºhrer Adolf Hitler. From the beginning of World War II the court convicted not only Wehrmacht members but also POW's and civilians in the area of operations. The Reichskriegsgericht acted as the first and last resort for 44 criminal offenses under penalty of death, such as: * High treason (Hochverrat), * State treason (Landesverrat), primarily espionage * War treason (Kriegsverrat), a diffuse term applied to all kind of actions that may affect the military strength like * Subversion of military strength (Wehrkraftzersetzung), which encompassed even critical statements * Conscientious objection (Kriegsdienstverweigerung) and desertion (Fahnenflucht). With the arms buildup and continued warfare, the number of Wehrmacht courts-martial increased to over 1,000. On 13 May 1941 Hitler had Keitel pass a directive, according to which any Wehrmacht officer had the authority to execute accused civilians in the area of Operation Barbarossa and the Eastern Front without trial. Against the laws of war, the official repeal of criminal prosecution led to widespread hostage-taking, mass executions, burning and looting by German forces. On March 8, 1945, Chancellor Adolf Hitler authorized the use of Fliegendes Sonder-Standgericht (Flying Courts- Martial) to try German armed forces in the field. The use of \\"flying\\" refers to their mobility and may also refer to the earlier \\"flying courts martial\\" held in Italian Libya. Italian military judges were flown by aircraft to the location of captured rebels where the rebels were tried in a court martial shortly after capture. Between 1939 and 1945 the Reichskriegsgericht in Berlin was responsible for over 1,400 executions including those by the Red Orchestra. In 1943 the court was transferred to Torgau, where it was based until the end of the war. In 1951 the building became the temporarily base of the Berlin Kammergericht (appellate court), since 2005 it is a private estate. After the German Instrument of Surrender, Nazi courts martial were not abolished by the Allied Control Council until 20 August 1946. In 2002 and 2009 the German Bundestag parliament has finally passed bills to suspend the verdicts against Wehrmacht for desertion and homosexual activity as well as against \\"war traitors\\".  Current law  Since 1949, the Federal Republic of Germany has no special military courts. Criminal acts committed by soldiers are tried in ordinary criminal courts by civilian judges. Article 96 paragraph 2 of German Basic Law (Grundgesetz) allows the government to create specialised military courts in case of war and for soldiers sent abroad, subject to a federal law. Such a law has not been passed. Smaller offences are being handled by disciplinary courts which are attached to the administrative court system. They may only pronounce disciplinary punishments, but no criminal sentences (e.g. no imprisonment, except 21 days of detention in the watch room).

Life Very little is known about Van der Voort's early life. He was born in Antwerp; his father was Pieter van der Voort, a painter. It is thought he studied with Cornelis Ketel. As a young man he was praised by Karel van Mander. In 1606 his brother Hans, a tailor, bought three parcels on which two houses were built. Hans moved into the one on the corner, and Cornelis in the one next to it.Meischke, R. (1956) Het Rembrandthuis. In: Jaarboek Amstelodamum, p. 4. Only a few years later Cornelis sold the house; in 1639 Rembrandt and his wife Saskia van Uylenburgh moved in. Today it is the Rembrandt House Museum. Around 1613 he was a member of the schutterij and painted a few schuttersstukken. At some time (before 1620) he inherited the house on the corner of the Sint Antoniesbreestraat from his brother. Van der Voort probably had seven children and married twice: in 1598 with Geertrui Willems, who died in 1609, and in 1613 with Cornelia Brouwers. He died in Amsterdam and was buried on 2 November 1624. In August 1625 his inventory was sold. In 1626 his art business was taken over by Hendrick van Uylenburgh. His widow moved to Leiden. Van der Voort painted full-length portraits in contemporary interiors: e.g. of Jan Cornelisz. Geelvinck as one of the regenten of a hospital, of Joan Huydecoper and his late wife and of Nicolaes Tulp. His work was in great demand and held in high esteem. In 1619 Van der Voort was the head of the Guild of St. Luke. He had a strong influence on the early portraits of Rembrandt, as well as the work of Nicolaes Eliasz. Pickenoy and Thomas de Keyser. His own students included David Bailly, David Bailii biography in De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen (1718) by Arnold Houbraken, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature who copied his collection of paintings, Pieter Luyx, Dirk Harmensz. and probably Pieter Codde.

Legal basics and responsibilities New Reichsmilit√§rgericht building (left), postcard, After the Prussian-led Unification of Germany, the German Empire with effect from 1 October 1900 had established a particular court- martial jurisdiction () to try soldiers of the German Army, with the Reichsmilit√§rgericht (RMG) as the supreme court. The presiding judge in the rank of a general or admiral was appointed directly by the German Emperor. From 1910, the court had its seat in a newly erected prestigious building in Charlottenburg. During World War I, German military law enabled military courts to try not only soldiers but also civilians held to have violated the military law. In the post-war Weimar Republic (1919-1933), the separate jurisdiction for military personnel was abolished by the law of 17 August 1920, based on Article 106 of the Weimar Constitution. After the Nazi seizure of power in 1933, courts-martial were reinstated by law of May 12, with effect from 1 January 1934. During the German re-armament and the deployment of the Wehrmacht armed forces, the Reichskriegsgericht was re-established as supreme court on 1 October 1936. According to the Wartime Criminal Code of Procedure (Kriegsstrafverfahrensordnung, KStVO) enacted by Hitler and Wilhelm Keitel on 17 August 1938, the RKG had jurisdictional competence over acts of high treason, treason, and aiding the enemy (Kriegsverrat); if the defendant was not directly liable to prosecution by his commander-in-chief. The court also had sole responsibility for all legal proceedings against highest-ranking Wehrmacht officers. Commemorative plaque to the conscientious objectors and members of the Resistance sentenced at the Reichskriegsgericht For all severe cases of Wehrkraftzersetzung (\\"undermining military force\\") according to Wartime Special Penal Code (Kriegssonderstrafrechtsverordnung, KSSVO), the RKG was the first and last instance. By this accusation, the court sentenced numerous conscientious objectors to death. By ordinance of 18 May 1940, proceedings against civilians were handed over to Sondergericht courts; from 29 January 1943, the \\"People's Court\\" (Volksgerichtshof) had exclusive jurisdiction over all accusations of public Wehrkraftzersetzung and intentionally evading military service. The President of the Reichskriegsgericht was able to affirm or to set aside a judgement; as was Hitler in his capacity as commander-in-chief of the Wehrmacht.

Life He was the son of John Budge, and was a native of Devon. He was educated at Saffron Walden, Essex, and was admitted at Christ's College, Cambridge, on 14 March 1820, when twenty years old. In 1824 he took the degree of B.A., and in the same year was ordained deacon by the bishop of Exeter. After holding several curacies in the west of England, he was instituted in 1839 to the small living of Manaccan, Cornwall, and remained there until 1846, when he was appointed by the bishop of Exeter to the more valuable rectory of Bratton Clovelly, North Devon. He died at his rectory on 3 Aug. 1865, aged 65. At his death his family was left without any provision for their support. In the hope of raising some money for their necessities, the Rev. R. B. Kinsman, the vicar of Tintagel, published, in 1866, a collection of Posthumous Gleanings from Budge's study and from the essays which he had contributed to the Saturday Review. Budge was a learned theologian and a skilled geologist. For Edward Pusey's Library of the Fathers he translated the Homilies of St. John Chrysostom on the Statues, and his scientific knowledge was shown in the numerous articles which he supplied to the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall, and to the Royal Institution of Cornwall, on the geology of the Lizard district. To the Rev. H. A. Simcoe's periodical of Light from the West he furnished a series of articles setting forth the reflections of the Christian Naturalist, which was published in 1838 in a volume bearing that title. A compilation from his pen The Mirror of History was issued in 1851. He published many visitation and other sermons.

In 1963 they broke into a secret government bunker, Regional Seat of Government Number 6 (RSG-6) at Warren Row, near Reading, where they photographed and copied documents. The RSGs were to include representatives of all the central government departments, to maintain law and order, communicate with the surviving population and control remaining resources. The public were virtually unaware what the government was planning for the aftermath of a nuclear war until it was revealed by Spies for Peace. They published this information in a pamphlet, Danger! Official Secret RSG-6. Four thousand copies were sent to the national press, politicians and peace movement activists and copies were distributed on the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament's Easter march from Aldermaston. The pamphlet said it was \\"about a small group of people who have accepted thermonuclear war as a probability, and are consciously and carefully planning for it. ... They are quietly waiting for the day the bomb drops, for that will be the day they take over.\\" It listed the RSGs and gave their telephone numbers. Most of the pamphlet was about RSG-6, which Spies for Peace described in detail. They said that \\"RSG-6 is not a centre for civil defence. It is a centre for military government\\", and they listed the personnel who were to staff it. The pamphlet described emergency planning exercises in which RSG-6 had been activated, including a NATO exercise in September 1962, FALLEX-62. Spies for Peace asserted that the exercise demonstrated the incapacity of the public services to cope with the consequences of nuclear attack and that the RSG system would not work. The exercise, they said, \\"proved once and for all the truth of the 1957 Defence White Paper that there is no defence against nuclear war.\\" In a hint at the source of their information, Spies for Peace said that FALLEX-62 \\"convinced at least one occupant of one RSG at least that the deterrent is quite futile\\". The pamphlet claimed that at the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis, a month after the NATO exercise, RSG-6 was not activated. The authors objected strongly to the fact that the RSG network had not been publicly debated, that its staff were unelected and that they would have military powers.Danger! Official Secret RSG-6, Committee of 100, July 1963 The 1963 Aldermaston issue of the CND bulletin Sanity included the Spies for Peace revelations and several hundred demonstrators left the Aldermaston route and headed for RSG-6 where they set up a picket. Spies for Peace made front page news but the press was later advised by an official \\"D-Notice\\" from saying any more about the matter. The police tried to prevent any further distribution of the information but failed to do so. RSGs in Cambridge and Edinburgh were also picketed. Although several people were arrested, the original spies were not identified or caught. After Nicolas Walter died, it was revealed in 2002 by his daughter Natasha Walter that her father was one of the Spies for Peace. It was revealed in 2013 with her consent, again by their daughter, that Ruth, Walter's wife, was also a member of the group.

He is the founder of what is now Folsom, California. Folsom's controversial purchase of Rancho Rio de los Americanos from the heirs of a San Francisco merchant William Alexander Leidesdorff remained tied up in litigation for many years, eventually reaching the Supreme Court of California after Folsom's death.William Alexander Leidesdorff: First Black Millionaire, American Consul and California Pioneer, by Gary Palgon, Published by Lulu.com, 2005 Early life Joseph Folsom was born on Monday, May 19, 1817 in Meredith, New Hampshire. He was the fourth child of Abraham Folsom and Mary Libbey. Descendants of a family that first arrived at Hingham, Massachusetts in the seventeenth century, and subsequently moved on to Exeter, New Hampshire, Abraham Folsom and his wife lived in a home near the northwest corner of Lake Winnipesaukee. Joseph had 5 siblings: Sally T. Folsom, George C. Folsom, Decatur A. Folsom, Charles P. Folsom, and Frank C. Folsom. Abraham Folsom died on Saturday, February 28, 1824, at the age of 46. Joseph was only 6 years old at the time of his father's death. Shortly after, the family moved southwest to Northfield, New Hampshire. Early military career In June 1836, at the age of eighteen, Joseph became a cadet at the Military Academy at West Point. Four years later, in June 1840, he graduated with honors. On November 3, 1840, he held the rank of Second Lieutenant in the 5th infantry of the U.S. Army. He served under the command of General William J. Worth in Florida during the Second Seminole War. In 1844, he returned to the Academy at West Point where he served as an Instructor of infantry tactics for two years. California In the Autumn of 1846, Lieutenant Folsom left West Point for California with the First Regiment of New York Volunteers, under the command of Colonel Jonathan D. Stevenson. They sailed for six months before arriving at a port in Yerba Buena (early San Francisco) in March 1847. He was promoted to the rank of Captain and held the position of Staff-officer in the Quartermaster's department. Folsom received orders from General Stephen W. Kearny to inspect San Francisco Bay to select an area for the Army's Military Depot. He was also the first Collector of the Port of San Francisco under American rule from 1847 to 1849. Folsom invested in real estate by purchasing land owned by William Alexander Leidesdorff from Leidesdorff's mother Anna Maria Spark for $75,000 - a controversial purchase which was mired in litigation for years. Increasing land values in California made Captain Joseph Libbey Folsom a millionaire. In 1854, he chose an area of land near Sacramento, which he named \\"Granite City\\". In 1855, Joseph Folsom hired Theodore Dehone Judah, an engineer, to survey the area and map out the town. Folsom chose to name the streets of his town after the names of his friends, family, and other important people in California. He became the second president of the Sacramento Valley Railroad. Joseph Folsom suffered from neuralgia, a painful nerve condition, and had symptoms of pneumonia. He died suddenly at the age of thirty-eight of renal failure while visiting friends at Mission San Jos√© (now Fremont, California) on Thursday, July 19, 1855. In February 1856, the executors of Folsom's estate: Halleck, Peachy, and P. Warren Van Winkle changed the name of Granite City to Folsom, in his honor.

As an ordinary court according to the German Courts Constitution Act (Gerichtsverfassungsgesetz), it deals with criminal and civil cases, superior to the local Amtsgerichte and the Landgericht Berlin. Its name differs from other state courts for historic reasons; there are no other courts called Kammergericht in Germany. History A Kammergericht was first mentioned in 1468, when it adjudicated in the chambers () of the prince-electors of Brandenburg. According to the Privilegium de non appellando granted by the Holy Roman Emperor, the Brandenburg subjects were prohibited from appealing to the Imperial authority. Therefore, the Kammergericht acted as supreme court in the Imperial estate ruled by the Hohenzollern electors. Collegienhaus As the appellate court of Brandenburg-Prussia and the Kingdom of Prussia from 1701, it was since 1698 based in the central C√∂lln quarter of Berlin. In 1735, under the rule of King Frederick William I, it moved to the newly erected Baroque Collegienhaus in the Friedrichstadt district (in present-day Kreuzberg). It then housed the supreme courts and judges of the different territories ruled in personal union by the royal House of Hohenzollern, without formally merging the different juridical systems. By this concentration in one locality the later unification of the juridical systems was prepared. The Collegienhaus is today part of the Jewish Museum Berlin. From the 18th century, the Kammergericht gained a reputation as independent authority in notable lawsuits such as Miller Arnold vs. Count of Schmettau (see Historic Mill of Sanssouci) or in the trial of Johann Heinrich Schulz. After the Greater Poland Uprising of 1846, numerous Polish insurgents, among them Ludwik Mieros≈Çawski and Karol Libelt, were tried at the Kammergericht, but amnestied by King Frederick William IV during the 1848 revolution. After German unification and the establishment of the uniform term Oberlandesgericht for a state supreme court by the German Empire in 1877, the Kammergericht kept its name. Kleistpark building Plenary hall In 1913, it moved to its present location in a newly erected Neo-Baroque building in the former Botanical Garden, laid out by Johann Sigismund Elsholtz in 1679, which had been relocated to the Dahlem and Lichterfelde in 1898. The premises in the present-day Sch√∂neberg district were renamed Heinrich-von-Kleist-Park on the occasion of Kleist's 100th death anniversary on 21 November 1911, and became colloquially known as Kleistpark. In August 1944 the Kleistpark building was the site of the show trial conducted by the People's Court (Volksgerichtshof) under Judge Roland Freisler against the surviving conspirators of the 20 July plot. A few months later the court had to leave the building and cede it to the Allied Control Council. On 18 October 1945, the International Military Tribunal (IMT) of the Nuremberg trials held its constituent meeting here. The building remained the official seat of the Council, though its meeting discontinued after the Soviet representatives left in protest in March 1948. On 3 September 1971, the Four Power Agreement on Berlin was signed here. The Kammergericht was based at the former Reichskriegsgericht in Charlottenburg during the Cold War era, until it moved back to its former location in 1997. Extensively restored, the Kammergericht building today is also the seat of the constitutional court of Berlin (Verfassungsgerichtshof) and the state's Attorney General (Generalstaatsanwalt).

It is located in the southern part of the county, approximately halfway between Amissville and Washington. Laurel Mills is located along the Thornton River in Rappahannock County on Route 618 (Laurel Mills Road), between Viewtown and Rock Mills. A post office was established at Laurel Mills at least as early as 1847 with Cornelius Smith as postmaster. This post office may have been moved from Newby's Crossroads, which was located about 1/2 mile east of Laurel Mills. The post office at Newby's Crossroads was established in 1814, and apparently ceased to exist between 1835 and 1847. and Accompanying four photos and Accompanying map A sawmill and a gristmill were known to operate at the Laurel Mills location even earlier. The sawmill was known as Baker's Mill and the gristmill was known as Roberts' Mill and may have been there previous to the American Revolution. This Roberts Mill may have been owned by either William Roberts (abt 1738-bef 1810) or his father John Roberts (abt 1703-abt 1802). The Laurel Mills store Laurel Mills has a cohesive collection of mid-to-late-19th-century architectural resources associated with the Rappahannock Woolen Mills. The structures in the village represent the Greek Revival, Queen Anne, Italianate and Gothic Revival architectural forms. A group of three workers' houses dating to approximately 1840 features several common -story wood-framed houses with stone foundations, while the impressive mill ruins of the Rappahannock Woolen Mills Company represent early 20th- century industrial architecture. An old, red-frame general store continues to serve the neighborhood, offering groceries and other necessities as well as self-service fuel. The mill owner's large dwelling was located on a bluff overlooking the village below. This old mansion has a turret and wide porches, and is today a bed and breakfast. The compact village took advantage of local geographical features, including the Thornton River, which provided water power to run the mill. Laurel Mills appears today much as it did when the mill closed in 1927, with its buildings lining a single road that follows the topography, curving sharply near the western edge of the district at the bluff. Across the Thornton River on a hill once stood the historic mansion of \\"Laurel Hill.\\" This mansion was built in the early 19th century by Major John Roberts, who served in the Revolutionary War and son of the aforementioned William Roberts, and whose family owned much land in the area, particularly on Battle Mountain and Battle Run which are to the east of Laurel Mills. \\"Laurel Hill\\" was home to this branch of the Roberts family until about 1850, when it was sold to the family of Puller Alexander Hughes. Unfortunately the mansion burned down in 1915 due to a defective flue in a modern kitchen which had been added to the structure. The Laurel Mills Historic District, covering the remains of the mill and other structures in the community, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.

Tlatelolco (, ) (also called Mexico Tlatelolco) was a prehispanic altepetl or city-state, in the Valley of Mexico. Its inhabitants were known as Tlatelolca. The Tlatelolca were a part of the Mexica, a Nahuatl-speaking people who arrived in what is now central Mexico in the 13th century. The Mexica settled on an island in Lake Texcoco, founding the altepetl of Mexico-Tenochtitlan on the southern portion of the island. In 1337, a group of dissident Mexica broke away from the Tenochca leadership in Tenochtitlan and founded Mexico-Tlatelolco on the northern portion of the island. Tenochtitlan was closely tied with its sister city, which was largely dependent on the market of Tlatelolco, the most important site of commerce in the area.Matos Moctezuma, Eduardo. \\"Tlatelolco\\". The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Culture, vol. 3, pp. 230-31. History Defeat of the Tlatoani of Mexico-Tlatelolco, Moquihuix, in 1473, according to Codex Telleriano-Remensis. Barrios of pre-conquest Tlatelolco over modern map In 1337, thirteen years after the foundation of Tenochtitlan, the Tlatelolca declared themselves independent from the Tenochca and inaugurated their first independent tlatoani (dynastic ruler). Under the king Quaquapitzahuac (1376-1417), the first two stages of the Main Pyramid of Tlatelolco were constructed. Under Tlacateotl (1417-1428), the Tlatelolca assisted the Tenochca in the war against the Tepanec empire, dominated by Azcapotzalco. Shortly thereafter, the first war between the Tenochca and Tlatelolca erupted. Also during Tlacateotl's reign, the third stage of the Main Pyramid was constructed. Under Quauhtlatoa (1428-1460), the Tlatelolca conquered the city-state of Ahuilizapan (now Orizaba, Veracruz), and fought against the people of Chalco along with the Tenochca. The fourth and fifth stages of the Main Pyramid were constructed in this period. The ruler Moquihuix (1460-1473) constructed the sixth stage of the temple, but in 1473, in the Battle of Tlatelolco, he was defeated by the Tenochca tlatoani Axayacatl, and Tlatelolco was made subject to Tenochtitlan. Itzcuauhtzin ruled Tlatelolco during a period in which it was almost completely incorporated into Tenochtitlan.Le√≥n-Portilla, M. 1992, 'The Broken Spears: The Aztec Accounts of the Conquest of Mexico. Boston: Beacon Press, During Cort√©s's siege of Tenochtitlan, the Mexicas would retreat to Tlatelolco, and even achieve a successful ambush against the Spanish conquistadores and their allies, but would ultimately fall along with the rest of the island to Spain. After the completion of the two-year Spanish Conquest of the Aztec Empire in 1521, the Spanish conquerors established the ruins of Mexico-Tenochtitlan as the Spanish capital of New Spain. The remnants of the indigenous populations of Tenochtitlan and Tlatelolco following the conquest were administered by indigenous elites in the incorporated Indian towns of Santiago Tlatelolco and San Juan Tenochtitlan. Tlatelolco remained an important location in the colonial era, partly because of the foundation there, of the school for elite indigenous men, the Colegio de Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco, which was the first school of higher learning in the Americas. Today its remains are located within Mexico City. In the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, archeological excavations have taken place at the Tlatelolco (archaeological site) in what is now part of Mexico City. The excavations of the prehispanic city-state are centered on the Plaza de las Tres Culturas, a square surrounded on three sides by an excavated Aztec site, a 17th-century church called Templo de Santiago, and the modern office complex of the Mexican foreign ministry. In February 2009, the discovery of a mass grave with 49 human bodies was announced by archaeologists. The grave is considered unusual because the bodies are laid out ritually.

Under the name \\"Mr Magic\\" he presented the show Magicland on WMC-TV in Tennessee from 1966 until his retirement in 1989. Dick performed tricks and illusions, juggled clubs and scarves, and is often remembered for his signature magician's finger exercises.Williams, Richard (1994). Lights! Cameras! Magic! (SPS Publications): pgs 49 & 86. Life and career Williams was born on 17 July 1927. He spent his early life in Kansas and began learning magic at the age of seven from a \\"Gilbert\\" magic set, which he had received as a Christmas present. He remained so keen on magic and became so proficient that his local magic club, the \\"Wizards of Wichita\\", later made an exception to its minimum age rule and allowed him to join when he was 13 rather than the usual lower limit of 18. During the second world war he performed with the club at military bases. He joined the US Navy in 1945 and served on the battleship USS West Virginia. He began his broadcasting career at the age of 17, when he won a voice contest and got a job as an announcer with a local radio station, KAKE. He worked there several years before transferring to KEDD-TV in 1955.Frodsham, Charles. \\"History of UHF Television (Wichita),\\" 2013.

Dick was a TV weatherman and performed over 300 magic shows on KGNC, now KAMR/NBC affiliate, in Amarillo, TX. In 1965, Williams joined WMC-TV, the NBC affiliate in Memphis, Tennessee, as a staff announcer and weatherman (over 7000 weathercasts by 1989). After hearing about his magic show in Texas, the WMC-TV management also asked him if he would start a similar show in Memphis. He agreed on the basis that he thought the show would run for about a year. Magicland was a weekly half-hour live-audience magic series for children and first aired on WMC-TV in 1966. Against Williams expectations, the show remained popular for 23 years until his retirement in 1989. In total, 1200 episodes were produced.

E. Bowkett.Darnell, Maxine. Attaining the Australian Dream: The Starr-Bowkett Way Popular in Australia from the late 19th century until the early to mid 20th century, and possibly an inspiration for modern micro- credit movements, they no longer exist in any form. Origins Dr. Thomas Edward Bowkett was a London surgeon, and a vocal proponent of a number of progressive and unionist ideas. His scheme to provide \\"mechanics\\" with a means to become landholders, and thus have a greater influence on government, was first proposed during a series of lectures and articles in 1843. In 1862 Richard B. Starr made some changes to Dr. Bowkett's scheme, including a slightly increased subscription fee and shorter subscription time, among others. The changes made the scheme more palatable to potential subscribers and Starr promoted his now copyrighted system aggressively. The Starr changes also made running a Starr-Bowkett Society profitable for management. Logistics of loans A registered society is formed with a limited number of memberships available. New members are assigned a number and select the amount of loan they wish to apply for. Members then pay a monthly subscription for a set time period - e.g. 200 months. The amount paid each month is based on the amount of the proposed loan, generally 0.25% of the loan. Once the society has accumulated sufficient funds from subscriptions, ballot meetings are begun and held on a monthly basis. Loan recipients are chosen by a lottery. Once a member has received a loan, they pay it back, along with any amount still owing on their original subscription commitment. Once all members have had the opportunity to take out a loan, the society is closed and the original capital returned to its members. History There were concerns over the lottery system involved in the scheme, which was carried out in full view of all members and therefore open to physical abuse to change those who received the funds. That, and the actions of some unscrupulous society managers, led governments in the United Kingdom to outlaw Starr-Bowkett societies there. However, they had spread to the Australian colonies, and became a popular option for a burgeoning middle class to afford their own homes.Darnell, Maxine.

It began on the island's largest city, also called Hvar, but spread to the entire island. Background The Venetian Republic ruled Dalmatia and its majority Croatian population since 1420 and appointed a Venetian noble (called Count) to head the city communes, thus removing the most important autonomous right of the local population. The local noble councils of the cities, however, still held authority in governing most local matters. As early as the 15th century, the citizens of the city of Hvar formed the so-called citizen's councils and demanded some government offices as well as authority in the government. The blunt refusal of these repeated demands was the first cause that sparked the rebellion. The second was the appalling behavior of noblemen towards the citizen's women, which included rape. Their husbands and fathers were unable to prevent or punish the offenders. Another cause was the rise of wealthy citizens' families that desired greater influence. In order to secure their power, local nobles instituted a law which prohibited the election into the ruling council of anyone whose father or grandfather was not its member. This legalized oligarchy proclaimed itself a god's institution, and passed criminal laws that greatly discriminated the ordinary citizens. The nobility went by the Medieval principle of intimidation, by which ordinary people were more likely to commit crimes, and that evil people, who were going to commit them anyway, could only be intimidated into obedience. This made it seem as though all ordinary citizens were potentially evil, and should be treated with that in mind. The legal discrimination was another deciding factor in the Rebellion. Rebellion The immediate cause for the uprising was the inhumane behavior of several of the nobles, which included rape of the citizens' women. An all-out revolt quickly gripped the island, led by Matija Ivaniƒá,Cultural History of Croatia by Zvane CrnjaInternational Dictionary of Historic Places: Southern Europe by Trudy Ring, Robert M. Salkin, Sharon La Boda a prominent citizen of Hvar. With a contingent of armed citizens, Ivaniƒá broke into the city and attacked the nobles. He executed some and burnt their houses, while incarcerating others. He demanded of the Hvar Prince equality in taxation and criminal law. Having gathered 2,000 armed men and 30 galleys for patrolling the coast and preventing the escape of the nobles to Venice, he took control of the island. In the second year he issued a demand to the Venetian Republic, asking for permission to hold a council of all classes in Hvar to create a more just government. The letter held 20 seals and signatures with 60 more prominent citizens voicing their support. At the same time, the citizens accused the nobles of injustices and demanded their punishment. At the beginning of the conflict, the Venetians kept an appearance of neutrality, probably due to their war against the League of Cambrai. They invited both sides to Venice; failing that, and due to the rebellion's significant impact on the whole of Dalmatia, the Venetians decided to energetically pursue its conclusion. Giovanni Navagero (Zuane Navaiero in Venetian) was consequently sent to Hvar, where he succeeded in pacifying the uprising in 1511 by unknown means, while the rebels still held control over the island and did not allow the nobles to return. However, by the end of the same year, there was unrest again against the Venetians in the whole of Dalmatia, which threatened to spread. Therefore, Venice sent Sebastiano Giustiniani,The Rough Guide to Croatia by Jonathan Bousfield from the Giustiniani family, to Hvar in 1512, and he tried to quell the uprising by brute force. He terrorized the citizens under his control, sentenced 69 to exile, and offered a bounty of 400 ducats on Matija Ivaniƒá's head. He was thwarted, though, by a decisive defeat of his troops at the hands of Ivaniƒá's forces near Jelsa, another town on the island. Sebastiano Giustiniani (Sebastian Justiniano in Venetian) was recalled, but the Venetians dispatched 15 war galleys under the command of Vincenzo Capello to end the rebellion. Upon his arrival, Capello managed to destroy all armed galleys of the rebels by October 1514, overcoming their land forces only after a prolonged struggle. Subsequently he hanged 19 leaders of the rebellion on his flagship, and cut off one hand and eye of 10 others. The Hvar Rebellion was destroyed, while Matija Ivaniƒá managed to escape the island and leave Venetian lands. He tried to return to Hvar several times without success, and later moved to Italy to the town of Vieste, where he is mentioned in sources for the last time around 1519. The struggle for the citizens' equality was continued by non-violent means by his son, Ivan Ivaniƒá, and his offspring.

The darkest of the three plays, it is about a teenage girl who tries to support herself and her mother through prostitution. Background See also: Background on Damsels in Distress (plays) page. GamePlan, along with FlatSpin, was originally intended to be part of a pair of plays, both set in the London Docklands, and both using the same cast of seven. Ayckbourn has a flat in the Docklands, where he observed that neighbours do not know each other well and strange things can happen under their noses.Allen, Paul (2004) A Pocket Guide to Alan Ayckbourn Plays London: Faber & Faber The pair of plays was eventually joined by a third, RolePlay, written as an afterthought, and the trilogy, Damsels in Distress, was shown in the Stephen Joseph Theatre's 2001 season.Damsels in Distress history on official Ayckbourn site Like the other two plays, this drew some inspiration from the London Docklands. This play was also a landmark in the progression of Ayckbourn's plays into darker and more contemporary material. Although contemporary subjects had been covered before, such as domestic violence in The Things We Do For Love, the subject of teenage prostitution was a new departure. It was still tame compared to the material now covered by other playwrights, but still arguably a gamble. Characters As part of the Damsels in Distress trilogy, GamePlan was written to use the same seven actors as the other two plays in the series. In this play, the characters are: * Sorrel Saxon, a sixteen-year-old schoolgirl * Lynette Saxon, her mother, forty, former businesswoman, now a cleaner * Kelly Butcher, Sorrel's friend, also sixteen * Leo Tyler, a dapper retired dry cleaner and Sorrel's first client * Dan Endicott, a detective police sergeant, forties * Grace Page, a severe WPC, thirties * Troy Stephens, a tabloid-quality journalist, thirties Sorrel, Lynette and Kelly are the main characters in the play, with the other four making smaller appearances in single scenes. Setting The entire play is set in Lynette Saxon's flat, on the riverside in the London Docklands. As part of Damsels in Distress, the play was written to use the identical set to the other two plays. As with most Ayckbourn plays, it was originally performed in the Round for its original production at the Stephen Joseph Theatre. However, it was adapted for the Proscenium for subsequent performances elsewhere. The play is performed in two Acts. Both acts are divided into three scenes. The play takes place over a period of six weeks.  Synopsis  The play opens at six in the morning with Sorrel Saxon catching her mother, Lynette, smoking. Lynette was a successful businesswoman, until business collapsed in the dotcom crash. She now cleans the offices she once managed (hence the early start and the smoking), whilst her husband ran off with her business partner to live abroad. Lynette mentions that they will not be able to afford the flat much longer, and contemplates moving out of London, in spite of Sorrel's protests. Unknown to Lynette, Sorrel already has her own plan to make ends meet. After Lynette leaves, Sorrel's friend, Kelly Butcher, arrives. She is an unassertive girl who always agrees with Sorrel. Sorrel's idea is to make money as a high- class call girl. Sorrel's researches consists of the internet (in particular the codewords for different services ‚Äì Sorrel intends to be \\"vanilla\\" or straight sex) and the rose-tinted story former classmate, Big Angie, who got chucked out of her school for doing the same. Sorrel seems convinced she knows what she is doing, and (as a result of her earlier experiences) sees sex as no big deal. Sorrel arm-twists Kelly to be her \\"maid\\", meeting the clients and helping if there's any trouble. In the second scene, Sorrel prepares for her appointment with her first client, her plans now well advanced. To make herself untraceable, she has set up a website of lovechicks.co.uk, assumed a business name of \\"Mandy\\", and obtained a mobile phone exclusively for her business. This does not stop her receiving calls from prospective customers requesting disgusting acts. The client is one that Sorrel confidently believes won't cause any trouble. The third scene takes place that evening. Kelly has brought, from her own savings, her maid's outfit, Sorrel's call girl underwear (so tight she can hardly breathe), and contraceptives. Then the client arrives. He is Leo Tyler, a mild-mannered man bearing flowers, tutting at the dirty magazines left for him, and more interested in talking about himself and his late wife. Sorrel's inexperience begins to show when she sprawls over the couch in an unsexy way. When Leo goes to the bedroom, she talks to Kelly about the noises call girls are supposed to make during sex, and starts to show doubts about the act. But with time short before Lynette returns home, this does not stop Sorrel going to the bedroom. Kelly mistakes Sorrel's very bad fake orgasm noises, as Sorrel being attacked, and rushes in with a vase of flowers to brain Leo. With the confusion resolved, Sorrel and Leo carry on. Then Sorrels returns from the bedroom, in tears, hyperventilating. Leo, having evidently had his money's worth, returns to find himself alone in the living room. He quietly places the money on the table, and promptly has a heart attack and dies. Act Two begins later that night. Lynette returns and senses Sorrel has problems, but Sorrel will not answer, nor discuss Lynette's own problems. Eventually, Lynette gives her a sleeping pill. In the middle of the night, Kelly comes back, and she and Sorrel quietly carry out Leo's body (which they hid earlier) and throw him over the balcony into the Thames. Just as they have done so, Lynette appears and asks questions. The two girls giggle helplessly, so she assumes it must be drugs. The next scene takes place two weeks later. Sorrel has aborted her plan and has put it behind her, assuming she and Kelly are in the clear. She has got rid of the website and switched off her \\"work\\" mobile, using it only once when her own mobile runs out of battery. She has just finished the chat when Lynette comes in with a bottle of cheap pink bubbly and announces that she has finally got a job, as a publisher for a small religious book group. But before she can open the bottle, Lynette and Sorrel start another row. But before the row end two police officers arrive at the door: Dan Endicott, who does the questioning, and Grace Page, who contributes Biblical quotations. They are investigating the death of Leo, and through tracing his internet use and where the body was found, they have narrowed down his whereabouts to this flat. When they question Lynette about the mobile number, she insists it's not hers or Sorrel's, but when they ring it, the mobile goes off. Lynette instantly responds by claiming she was the call girl, and Sorrel's attempted confession is ignored. In the final scene, Kelly is helping Lynette and Sorrel pack to move, clearly in advanced stages as boxes now litter the whole flat. Although no-one was arrested (owing to the police failing to pin down exactly how Leo died), word has got round about Lynette's confession. Sorrel explains to Kelly that after being ostracised by her neighbours, Lynette appears to have given up. She has declined the job, and is moving to Doncaster for no better reason than once knowing some people who lived there. A journalist then calls at the door, introducing himself as Troy Stephens, from a magazine (evidently a trashy one) called \\"As It Is\\", which is ironic as he wishes to run a story on Lynette Saxon turning to prostitution to support her daughter. Noticing Lynette's lack of enthusiasm, Troy mentions that a fee, which he shows her on a piece of paper. Lynette suggests she would say yes if they add a zero to the end of the figure. Troy goes outside to check with his office, whilst Lynette gets out the bottle of pink bubbly (left untouched since the police visit) on standby. She says that it probably won't be the answer they want, but there will be other chances. With the bottle ready, the play instantly ends just as the door opens, giving the impression that, whatever happens, the friendship of the three women will survive.

However, the success of RolePlay over the other two productions led to GamePlan being sidelined, along with FlatSpin, until eventually it was shown only once a week, to the disappointment of both Ayckbourn and the cast. However, there were four subsequent professional productions of GamePlan between 2004 and 2008,Arts Archive UK performance listings (continued) as opposed to RolePlay which had only three.Arts Archive UK performance listings of RolePlay Critical reviews Reviews of GamePlan were dominated by the decision of Ayckbourn to write a play on such a different area to his normal territory. Michael Billington of The Guardian wrote: \\"... his 58th and latest play strikes me as unsettling as anything he has written. What the Scarborough audience treated as a robust romp I took to be a cry of despair about the moral depths to which our society has sunk\\".The Guardian review, 30 May 2001 The reviews were, on the whole, supportive of the change of tone. They also generally liked the concept of writing for a repertory company. The opinions of the play itself, however, were more mixed. The reviews were generally favourable of the first half. John Peter, for The Sunday Times, praised the comedy scene where Sorrel tries to get Leo's attention with her unerotic gestures,The Sunday Times review, 3 June 2001, as shown on Ayckbourn site but Michael Billington saw it as \\"the desperate pathos of a schoolgirl seeking to vamp an older man\\". The opinion of the second half was less favourable. Although some reviewers were satisfied with the way Ayckbourn had mixed the comedy and drama,The Daily Telegraph review, 19 June 2001, as shown on Ayckbourn site most were unconvinced the mixture worked in such a dark situation. Jeremy Kingston wrote for The Times: \\"The two policemen are caricatures, and to make one of them prone to long biblical quotes is a pretty desperate attempt to flesh out a character\\", although the same scene was positively received by Dave Windass of The Stage.The Stage review, 7 June 2001, as shown on Ayckbourn site When touring, GamePlan received further reviews as part of the whole Damsels in Distress trilogy. The trilogy as a whole received positive reviews, and GamePlan was generally deemed much stronger than FlatSpin, but most praise was reserved for RolePlay.The Daily Telegraph review of Damsels in Distress, 9 September 2002 This later led to the marginalisation of GamePlan and FlatSpin in favour of this play.

Internally within NATS it is usually known by the initials AC. The Swanwick facility replaces that of the former site at West Drayton. LACC shares the Swanwick site with the London Terminal Control Centre (LTCC), which moved there in 2007. AC-based controllers provide air traffic services mainly within the London Flight Information Region (FIR). This airspace is split into five Local Area Groups (LAGs) which relate to the position of the airspace sector groups within the FIR. All sectors have the R/T callsign \\"London Control\\". Also within the AC Operations room sit the FIR Flight Information Service Officers (FISOs) who provide an information service to aircraft operating within the London FIR as a whole using the callsign \\"London Information\\". 'Swanwick Military' controllers are also based in the AC Operations room.  AC Local Area Groups and Sectors  Each sector is assigned a sector number which is used when co- ordinating the passage of aircraft between each other.

He was a great nephew of Nicholas II, the last Emperor of Russia. Early life Prince Michael Andreevich was born in Versailles, the second child and eldest son of Prince Andrei Alexandrovich of Russia and Donna Elisabetta di Sasso- Ruffo (1886‚Äì1940). He was a grandson of Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich of Russia and Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia and a great nephew of Nicholas II, the last Emperor of Russia. From his father's first marriage he had two siblings, an older sister Xenia and a younger brother Andrew. From his father's second marriage he had one half sister, Olga. Neither Grand Duke Cyril Vladimirovich nor his son Grand Duke Vladimir Cyrillovich (who were heads of the House of Romanov from 1924 to 1992) recognised Michael as a Prince of Russia. Cyril and Vladimir held that the marriage of Prince Michael Andreevitch's parents was not dynastic and that Michael had no succession rights to the Russian throne. They accorded him the title HSH Prince Romanovsky-di Sasso Ruffo.\\" Prince Michael Andreevich was educated at Beaumont College in Old Windsor, and lived with his parents and his grandmother Grand Duchess Xenia in exile at Craigowan Lodge on the Balmoral Estate in Scotland as well as at Frogmore Cottage on the grounds of Windsor Castle. The family later stayed at Wilderness House until Michael was commissioned to serve in the Royal Navy during World War II. During the war Michael served in Australia with the Fleet Air Arm. He moved there permanently following the conclusion of the war and became an aviation engineer. Marriages and later life Prince Michael Andreevich married three times. On 24 February 1953 at Sydney he married Jill Murphy (b. 1921); the marriage was short lived and was dissolved by divorce in September 1953. On 23 July 1954 at Sydney he married Shirley Cramond (1916‚Äì1983). On 14 July 1993 at Sydney he married Giulia Crespi (b. 1930). Michael had no children from any of his marriages. In 1980 Prince Michael Andreevich became Imperial protector of the Sovereign Order of the Orthodox Knights Hospitaller of St. John of Jerusalem which was formerly under the protection of his father Prince Andrei and uncle Prince Vasili. In 2006 he was elected Grand Prior. This group is not recognised by the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, or the Associated Orders of St. John. He was also vice-president of the Romanov Family Association.

He was a successful politician, being elected to the Queensland Parliament on several occasions. He held the office of Attorney-General of Queensland and was also the Minister for Mines and introduced many successful law reforms measures in Queensland. In latter life, he took up an appointment as a judge of the Supreme Court of Queensland and went on to become the Chief Justice of that court. Blair took on many civic roles including that of Chancellor of the University of Queensland. His biographer states that Blair was thought of as a \\"dandy\\"Gill, J. C.

Retrieved 2 May 2008 because he wore a white gardenia in his coat buttonhole and a silk handkerchief protruding from his breast pocket. Blair was said to be witty, possess a delightful personality, a gift of speech, and a love of humour, although author Frank Hardy is accused of referring to Blair as \\"venal\\" through veiled references in the book \\"Power Without Glory\\". Early years Blair was born at Coalfalls, Ipswich, Queensland on 16 May 1870. He was the son of Gordon Blair and Julie Blair (n√©e Droughton). He was first educated by his mother but he later attended Ipswich West State School. He later attended Ipswich Grammar School between 1882 and 1888. He read for the preliminary Queensland Bar examinations in Brisbane. Blair lived at Swanwick's in Norman Park at the time and was called to the Queensland Bar on 6 March 1894. Blair shared chambers with the Queensland Attorney General of the time, Thomas Joseph Byrnes. Blair appeared as junior counsel in many significant cases. One of those was the appeal to the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Queensland by Patrick Kenniff and James Kenniff. Both had been convicted of murdering a property owner and a police constable after the homestead they were staying in was burnt to the ground. The appeal did not succeed and Patrick Kenniff was executed soon after and his brother went on to serve a gaol term.Heap, Grenfell, Kenniff, Patrick (1863 - 1903), Australian Dictionary of Biography. Retrieved 1 June 2008 Political career Judge Blair Blair's association with Byrnes led to his interest in politics. Blair contested the 1902 Queensland state election as an independent candidate for Ipswich. He was one of two elected to represent Ipswich in that election. Blair captured the hearts of the electorate by putting up heart shaped signs saying \\"Give Jimmy a vote\\" or \\"In the hearts of the people\\". In the Queensland Legislative Assembly, he opposed Sunday trading for pubs and hotels, restricted hours for bars, prohibition of the sale of tobacco to children and the stringent enforcement against gambling. He also sought the takeover of private schools by the Government and the provision of more scholarships after their takeover. In 1903, at the age of 33, Blair was invited to become Attorney-General of Queensland after Sir Arthur Morgan became Premier of Queensland after the Liberal-Labour coalition victory.Atkinson, Justice R., (28 March 2004), Paper: \\"Scots and the Law in Queensland\\". One of Blair's first acts was to abolish the office of sheriff. This led to the sacking of Arthur Hoey David (also known as author Steele Rudd). This led to many vicious personal attacks on Blair in Steele Rudd's Magazine.Atkinson The office of sheriff was quickly restored when it was realized how much the sheriff actually did. In 1904, Blair additionally became the Minister for Mines. In 1905, Blair introduced the Worker's Compensation Act 1905 (Qld), a major change to workplace safety laws in Queensland. Previous efforts at reform in this area had stalled and this legislation changed the focus from the regulation of safety to instead requiring employers to compensate employees for workplace accidents.Cowan, Paula, Doctoral Thesis: Of the People, By the People, For the People . He introduced the Children's Court Act 1907 (Qld) providing for the first specialized children's courts in Queensland. These courts were a great success. These specialized children's courts continue to exist in modern times. However, he was unable to gather support for changes to mining laws or to education. As joint editor, he published an annotated version of the Workers Compensation legislation in 1906. He also jointed revised the \\"Queensland Police Code and Justices' Manual of the Criminal Law\\" written by Robert Archibald Ranking.Gistitin, Carol E.Ranking, Robert Archibald (1843 - 1912), Australian Dictionary of Biography.

Retrieved 2 June 2008 He lost those offices in 1907 when Sir Robert Philp became Premier, but was eventually re-appointed after Kidston regained the premiership in 1908. A constitutional impasse over the Queensland Legislative Council between the Queensland Governor, Lord Chelmsford, and Kidston as Premier led to a general election. Blair introduced two pieces of legislation that became crucial in the later abolition of the upper house. The first reduced the requirement for a two- thirds majority for a bill to become law in Queensland. After this was passed, a further law change was made that allowed for referendum of the people to be held to make laws had been refused in two consecutive sessions of Parliament. Kidston offered Blair an appointment to the Supreme Court of Queensland in 1908. However, he declined it because it was to be a Northern Queensland appointment and he preferred a Brisbane placement. When Kidston formed a coalition with the Opposition, he removed Blair from his ministerial roles to allow for coalition members to be appointed. Blair went on to lead what became known as the \\"Independent Opposition\\". In 1911 he became president of Tattersall's Club. He held this role until 1922. He married Christina Gibson on 29 February 1912 at St Andrew's Church of England, South Brisbane. They had no children. At the general election in that year, Blair stood as a Government candidate for Ipswich. He was elected and he returned to the ministry as Secretary for Public Instruction and held this office until 1915. In Parliament, he introduced law changes to raise the age of consent from 14 to 17 years of age. He also introduced changes to prevent wills excluding immediate family, as well as introducing rules that restricted corporate ownership of pharmacies to Family Societies. He also changed the criteria for the awarding of secondary school scholarships by making them available to all who qualified, rather than by way of competition. In 1915 Blair lost his seat in parliament at the general election, and he returned to private practice as a barrister. He appeared as junior counsel in the \\"Legislative Council referendum\\" case in which he argued that legislation abolishing the Upper House in Queensland was valid. The Full Court of the Supreme Court of Queensland ruled against the validity of that legislation. However, the High Court of Australia overturned that decision and ruled that it was valid. Blair became a member of the senate of the University of Queensland in 1915 and 1916. Judicial career In 1922, Blair was again offered an appointment as a judge on the Northern Queensland bench. This time he accepted and he and his family moved to Townsville. He subsequently moved to the Central Queensland bench in 1923 which was based at Rockhampton. He was appointed Chief Justice of Queensland on 24 April 1925 on the death of Thomas McCawley. He was reappointed to the senate of the University of Queensland in 1926 and became chancellor in 1927. Blair was knighted in the 1930 New Year Honours. In 1931 Blair heard a civil claim for damages against two former premiers of Queensland, William McCormack and Edward Granville Theodore in relation to the \\"Mungana affair\\".Caine, Neville. \\"Theodore, Edward Granville (1884 - 1950)\\", Australian Dictionary of Biography. Retrieved 2 June 2008 They were both accused of conspiracy in respect of the purchase of two mines in Northern Queensland from the Mungana Mining Corporation. The case achieved public notoriety as Theodore was then the Treasurer of the Australian Government. The trial lasted twenty-days before a jury and had to be held in the Brisbane City Hall because of the number of defendants. It led to a verdict in favour of McCormack and Theodore. In 1939, Blair and a jury held a trial in respect of a large of number of accused who had been part of the League for Social Justice. The accused had invaded the Legislative Council chambers armed with baton, barbed wire and hammers. Blair's biography states that Blair made it clear to the jury that the accused were guilty, but the jury found that they were not. Frank Hardy's novel \\"Power Without Glory\\" uses thinly veiled references to Blair in the novel. Hardy uses the character in the novel to accuse Blair of venality. Blair's biographer dismisses these references as simply gossip. Blair was also to be the president of Queensland Rugby Union. Vice-regal roles Sir James Blair's headstone at Brisbane's Balmoral Cemetery. Blair acted as deputy governor for brief periods whilst chief justice. He also served as Administrator of Queensland pending the arrival of the new governor in April 1932. He was appointed lieutenant-governor of Queensland on 31 May 1933. He was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) on 3 June 1935 in George V's Silver Jubilee King's Birthday Honours. Blair retired as chief justice on 16 May 1940 but remained as lieutenant-governor. Blair was the subject of controversy when Justice Edward Douglas of the Supreme Court published a statement in the Brisbane-based Truth newspaper in 1944 alleging that Blair had suppressed a pension plan for judges. Douglas further alleged that Blair had received a salary as lieutenant-governor and had been given large undisclosed sums of money by the government to suppress pensions for judges. The allegations caused the other judges of the Court to condemn Douglas and lend their support to Blair. It emerged later in the Queensland Parliament that Douglas was mistaken over the pensions issue, that Blair had not received a salary as lieutenant-governor, and that the undisclosed payments were in fact payment for untaken leave. Blair died on 18 November 1944 at the Mater Misericordiae Hospital in South Brisbane. A service was held at St John's Cathedral, Brisbane, and a state funeral proceeded to Bulimba Cemetery (now called Balmoral Cemetery or sometimes called Morningside Cemetery).About Balmoral Cemetery.

Hegna founded the spaghetti western-themed indie rock combo Federale and remains their principal songwriter. In addition, he has played bass with The Brian Jonestown Massacre since 2004. As co-owner of SE Portland's Revolver Studios, Hegna has produced releases from Joel Gion, Matthew J. Tow, and David J. He has also served as engineer for artists and events ranging from acclaimed neo-psychedelia acts The Quarter After and The Richmond Sluts to exurban roots festival Pickathon. His songs, both with and without instrumentation by Federale, have appeared on a variety of film and television soundtracks including The Bad Batch, The Lego Movie, and Breakthrough. He oversaw the music for the Emmy-nominated Super Bowl commercial \\"Halftime in America\\". Early life The native Oregonian spent much of his youth outdoors around the state's varied natural environments ‚Äì the high desert, trout creeks, his grandfather's farm ‚Äì and has said that upbringing helped instill an appreciation for the romanticism of the west. As a teenager, Hegna attended Beaverton High School, where he played bass in the jazz band. His father, Gailen Hegna, has owned and operated Rainbow Recording Studio for more than 30 years. Gailen served as mixer and engineer on recordings for a variety of Portland-area acts including jazz bassist David Jay White, Christian metallers Godspeed, Susan and the Surftones, and 90s Caleb Klauder/Jenny Conlee band Calobo. He also provided additional engineering on the third album (The Blood Flowed Like Wine) of Collin's band Federale. From 1996 to 2001, Hegna attended the University of Oregon's School of Music and Dance. His studies included Electronic Composition within the Future Music Oregon program, and he graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Music Technology. While still attending school, Hegna began playing bass for Cocaine Unicorn, a tambourine- spiked retro-chic combo formed by singer/songwriter Paul Burkhart whose membership included Carl Werner, Dasa Kalstrom, and Ryan Sumner. Willamette Week described their sound as \\"swagger-heavy Anglophile pop ‚Ä¶ ready to ride the garage wave straight to the Strokes' sex, drugs and rock-'n'-roll after- party.\\" After two years in Eugene, during which Burkhart complained the act was labeled \\"a fashion band\\", they relocated to Portland and attracted strong local buzz, though intra-band strife would eventually end the group before they could record a proper album. The Pains of Being Pure at Heart founder Kip Berman was a friend of Burkhart's and wrote the song \\"Hey Paul\\", off of their self-titled debut album, as an \\"homage\\" to Cocaine Unicorn. Brian Jonestown Massacre Since 2004, Hegna has played bass for critically acclaimed psych- rock act the Brian Jonestown Massacre. The band, which gained an unexpected mainstream notoriety following the release of Sundance-Grand-Jury-award- winning documentary Dig, endured regular changes of membership under the volatile leadership of founding singer-songwriter Anton Newcombe. Following the resignation of his band's drummer and bassist, Newcombe posted a note on then-popular social media site Friendster seeking replacements. Cocaine Unicorn drummer Ryan Sumner responded volunteering himself and Hegna for the positions, and the pair drove to Los Angeles for auditions. Though the original drummer ended up returning, Hegna soon became an integral member of their rotating \\"rogues' gallery of past lineups and psychedelic standard- bearers\\". He would accompany the band across the globe and play a key role in their performances. Even at the height of BJM extravagance, when their live sets swelled to include four or five guitars, critics praised \\"Hegna's tight rhythm work\\" as an indispensable grounding element. Once the group scaled back their touring personnel, Hegna's presence served as an increasingly important component as the line-up became, in Newcombe's words, \\"much cleaner and defined\\". Nevertheless, though he has longest continuous tenure with the band of any current BJM member, performances remains fraught with tension. On-stage strife between Newcombe and Hegna nearly ended a June 2018 concert in Brisbane Australia. Other bands While Federale and Brian Jonestown remained his primary groups, Hegna would occasionally lend his talents to high-profile side-projects launched by established artists. In 2010, when Dandy Warhols' founding member Peter Holmstr√∂m first assembled his psych-rock quintet Pete International Airport, Hegna added \\"whistling\\" to the self-titled debut and bass on tour. Austinist thought \\"their straightforward '70s revivalist sound strikes comparisons to The Doors as ... Collin Hegna‚Äôs distorted bass lines float through the air.\\" Hegna would also join a group formed by longtime BJM mainstay/The Out Crowd founder Matt Hollywood. Staffed by musicians with ties to Brian Jonestown or similarly celebrated NW-adjacent psych-garage sensations, Rebel Drones brought together bassist Hegna, guitarist Holmstrom, multi-instrumentalist William (Grails) Slater, and drummer Jason (The Warlocks) Anchondo around frontman Hollywood. Given the star-studded roster's pre-existing obligations, the supergroup proved short-lived. Members inevitably drifted back toward their own projects, and, as Hollywood would later explain, Rebel Drones \\"lost momentum. Everybody in the band had a lot of other things going on, and, eventually, it just ‚Ä¶ wasn't a priority.\\" During Drones' brief mid-2000s tenure, the act did enter Hegna's Revolver studio to lay down material for a potential album. Writing of the \\"nearly forgotten recordings\\" almost a decade later, the Phoenix New Times found \\"its drone ‚Ä¶ delicious and mind-expanding.\\" Although never officially put out, the tracks slowly gathered an online following among the BJM faithful and fans of Hollywood's solo work. One song entitled \\"Drugs\\" has received more than 100K plays on YouTube since it was first uploaded (without corresponding video) seven years ago. Finally, in the summer of 2018, former members announced that Cardinal Fuzz Records would release both digital and (Double LP) vinyl editions of the Rebel Drones sessions entitled Abusing The System. Federale Along with former Cocaine Unicorn members Werner, Kalstrom, and Sumner, Hegna formed Federale in 2005. The band became known for creating evocative, almost-entirely instrumental tunes similar to cinematic scores, which the Seattle Weekly found deserving of comparison to \\"Goblin, Ennio Morricone and Angelo Badalamenti for a sweeping nod to soundtracks of the past\\". The AV Club noted that \\"Federale specializes in making soundtrack music for films that don‚Äôt exist yet, using pedal steel, trumpets, whistling, and all the other orchestral flourishes associated with Italian cinema of the '60s and '70s.\\" Sumner, the drummer credited with originating their cinematic approach, died from a blood clot to the heart during the band's first year. Werner and Kalstrom eventually moved on to other projects as various Portland- area musicians joined the rotating line-up around Hegna. Due to the number of people who contributed to the album, Hegna said at the time that he considered the endeavor \\"primarily a studio project\\" and that he had no ambitions of touring the band. Federale's current line-up includes Rick Pedrosa, Nalin Silva, classical soprano Maria Karlin, orchestral percussionist Brian Gardiner, Colin Sheridan (The High Violets), and Sebastian Bibb-Barrett (The Builders and the Butchers). La Rayar: A Tale of Revenge After playing together for three years, Federale recorded their debut LP La Rayar: A Tale of Revenge, a song-cycle based around the story of an ordinary man (Santiago) spurred toward acts of violence following the slaughter of his family by a Native American tribe. To help convey the underlying storyline, bits of narration were inserted within the otherwise instrumental album. \\"We'll come up with a story line and a cast of characters [and] write a theme for each character,\\" Hegna explained. \\"The different themes and songs tell the story.\\" Marveling at the seriousness with which Federale embraced spaghetti western soundscapes, the Portland Mercury advised listeners to \\"let the whistled melodies, wooden flutes, rattling snare drums, twangy guitars, and trumpets pour in.\\" \\"It's the music to a movie we conceptualized,\\" Hegna said about the record. \\"The movie doesn‚Äôt actually exist, [but] each character in ‚Äòthe movie‚Äô has a theme and the various themes ... are developed and recur through various permutations as the events change and as the characters are affected by what happens in the story.\\" Devil in a Boot In 2009, Federale put out their second album, Devil in a Boot. The band recorded half of the tracks in Hegna's Revolver Studios while utilizing the organic reverb of a vacant Masonic temple for the remainder. As with their debut, the LP's overarching concept focuses upon an average man driven by horrific tragedy to wreak vengeance against the railroad baron who stole his home, murdered his loved ones, and left the protagonist entombed in a shallow grave. \\"The themes of classic westerns are all there in the totalities and timbres,\\" wrote Josiah Mankovsky for The Dropout, \\"solitude and pain, shootouts and feuds, long dusty rides and revenge.\\" Acknowledging the band's debt to Morricone, the Portland Mercury further noted that Federale were \\"respectful in their path, crafting a graceful and stylistic sound that sprawls out as a soundtrack to some hidden western cinematic gem.\\" In 2011, a promotional EP featuring three songs from the album alongside the unreleased track \\"Sarcophagus\\" was sent out with deliveries by Portland's Lonesome Pizza. The Blood Flowed Like Wine By the release of their third full-length, The Blood Flowed Like Wine, Federale songs had already been licensed by various television shows and commercials broadcast nationwide, but opportunities for scoring a nationally released motion picture had thus far eluded them. (\\"Django\\", the sixth track on the album, was originally written in hopes of potential use by Quentin Taurantino for his then-in-production feature Django Unchained.) To that end, though an interior plot does link much of The Blood Flowed Like Wine, the storyline is not highlighted with the prominence of their earlier works, and there is no explanatory libretto or narration. As well, the music expands the Federale sound beyond the spaghetti western-replicating tropes of past albums. Most notably, the group invited KP (Spindrift) Thomas and Alex (Black Angels) Maas to contribute vocals to tracks that formerly would have been instrumental. In contrast with the more collaborative process of past recordings, Hegna largely composed the songs himself by crafting a digital simulation of each part before arranging full orchestration with the Federale regulars, augmented by members of the 45th Parallel chamber ensemble, pedal steel guitarist Paul (Richmond Fontaine, The Decemberists) Brainard, and members of the Oregon Symphony. The Portland Mercury noted approvingly that \\"Federale has expanded to include strings, horns, and a much richer, more orchestral foundation.\\" Writing for the Oregonian, Jason Simms found that the band's familiar backdrops were now laced with Middle Eastern-tinged accents, and praised the \\"mystical, desert feel that ties it all together.\\" All the Colours of the Dark Although Federale had returned to the studio to begin recording new material in the summer of 2013, it would be another four years before their next release. By this time, Hegna had led the act into regular licensing opportunities for television shows and commercials, and his continually expanding vision for the project made All the Colours of the Dark a significant departure from their previous blueprint. Noting that All the Colours of the Dark was Federale's \\"least instrumental release to date\\", the Portland Mercurys reviewer appreciated that \\"this shift broadens the potential directions for the band... but also places new emphasis on lyrics, which ‚Äì at least for right now ‚Äì are not Federale‚Äôs strong suit.\\" The A.V. Club, conversely, looked fondly on the band's progression \\"into pop songwriting, giving you all the emotion of an Ennio Morricone instrumental track with... go-go appeal.\\" In a view that perhaps best summarized the critical consensus, Victoria Segal's three-star review for Mojo acknowledged that \\"All the Colours of the Dark doesn't lack for skills or high drama,\\" but she nevertheless decided the band \\"can't quite shake off a dust cloud of gimmickry.\\"Segal, Victoria. \\"Federale\\", Mojo magazine January 2017: n 278. page 100. Print. If the foundation of their music remained \\"reverb guitar ‚Ä¶ and classic gothic whistling\\", Federale continued to broaden their sonic palate. Preparing for their first major West Coast tour in the fall of 2016, Hegna made a point of showcasing \\"quite a few instruments on stage that you don‚Äôt generally see in a rock band setting ‚Äì pedal steel, whistling, trumpet, operatic vocals, and an army of percussion instruments. We‚Äôve arranged all these songs so that parts interweave and pop in and out of the sonic forefront [for] a pretty immersive live music experience.\\" Soundtracks From the outset, Hegna had been clear about his intentions to create musical accompaniments for motion pictures. \\"You can express yourself more articulately in the context of a film,\\" he told Willamette Week in 2009. \\"[It‚Äôs] a really powerful way to convey emotions.\\" One year earlier, Federale had contributed the score for Portland-based filmmaker Todd E Freeman's indie thriller Pray For Hell. Although that would be Hegna's most extensive cinematic effort for some time, his band continued to appear on various film and television soundtracks including 2014 blockbuster The Lego Movie. \\"War Cry\\", by Hegna and bandmate Carl Werner, can be heard as the film's main protagonist Emmet plummets into an Old West-themed area. Oregon Public Broadcasting deemed the resulting musical flourish \\"a brief, but notable nod to Federale‚Äôs signature sound.\\" \\"Halftime in America\\" Arguably his greatest soundtrack success came producing and engineering the music for breakout Super Bowl commercial \\"Halftime in America\\". Written by Tin House poetry editor Matthew Dickman and directed by David Gordon Green, the 2012 Wieden+Kennedy ad for Chrysler was broadcast during Super Bowl XLVI, which was at the time the most-watched program in the history of American television, with an estimated viewership above 111 million. Portland multi-instrumentalist Alison Ables composed the music. Lydia Van Dreel, associate professor at the University of Oregon's School of Music and Dance, played the French horn during recording sessions at Hegna's Revolver Studios. The spot was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Commercial, and received praise from Ad Week as \\"the one Super Bowl ad that dared to go beyond advertising and join a larger national conversation... with muscle and style.\\" In the two-minute piece, voiceover narration from Clint Eastwood conveys a stirring account of the United States car industry's bounce back after prolonged recessionary struggles. Set against a monochromatic clip montage of average citizens on the job, an elegiac backdrop of organ and horns plays throughout. As one journal described, \\"its quietness evolves into a crescendo as the narrative of the story reaches its climax.\\" The piece was singled out for acclaim by The New Yorker classical music columnist Alex Ross. Writing for his personal website, he explained that he was \\"pulled in not only by the rasp of Clint Eastwood's voice but also by the intriguingly dour score, which avoids the ersatz Coplandisms you might expect in this context... It reminds me a little of J√≥hann J√≥hannsson's music for The Miners' Hymns.\\" The following year, Hegna co-founded Perfect Prescription Sound, a Portland company specializing in composing music for advertising, film, and television. Their clients have included Nike, Adidas, Rockport, Isaac Mizrahi, and the New York Yankees. A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night In 2013, Hegna met Ana Lily Amirpour following a Brian Jonestown Massacre gig just after the young writer-director had finished the script for her feature debut, A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night. As she described her plans for the \\"Iranian vampire Western\\", he explained the music of Federale, and they agreed to collaborate on the upcoming film. \\"When I heard that music,\\" Amirpour said, \\"I knew it was the musical spine of the film. I knew certain sequences were going to be built around those pieces of music; it's almost like scoring the film to the music and not the other way around.\\" After premiering at the 2014 Sundance Festival, A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night was released nationally in November of that year to rave reviews. Several critics praised Armipour's choice of emotionally charged musical selections. \\"The soundtrack to A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night is one of the best in recent memory,\\" wrote Kaleen Aftab for The Independent, \\"[and] at its heart are the spaghetti western-inspired sounds of Federale, the side project of Collin Hegna.\\" In all, Federale contributed five of the 17 songs used. Death Waltz, a niche imprint specializing in soundtracks, would release a double LP featuring music and dialogue from the film. The album was launched with a party at South by Southwest that featured a Federale concert and DJ set from Elijah Wood. The Bad Batch For Amirpour's sophomore effort The Bad Batch, Hegna contributed the title track of Federale's fourth album, All The Colours Of The Dark ‚Äì a \\"scorched-country duet\\", as Willamette Week wrote, that finds the vocal pairing of Hegna and bandmate Maria Karlin approximating \\"a reverse- engineered Lee Hazlewood and Nancy Sinatra.\\" The song so successfully echoed a vintage aesthetic that Katie Rife, in her review of the film for the A.V. Club, mentioned erroneously that the ballad in question \\"was the theme song to the 1972 giallo film All The Colors Of The Dark‚Äîit really sounds like a relic of the era, to be fair ...\\" While critical response to The Bad Batch ended up more mixed than with Amirpour's debut, reviewers once again highlighted its soundtrack ‚Äì \\"the sharpest tool in the movie‚Äôs arsenal,\\" in the words of the Hollywood Reporter ‚Äì as did advertising campaigns promoting the film. In that vein, a well-publicized video for All the Colours of the Dark containing Bad Batch footage was released one day before its theatrical debut, alongside images of the soundtrack's cover artwork.McNally, Darby. \\"Exclusive: Check Out The Bad Batch Soundtrack Art, Video For Federale's 'All the Colours of the Dark'\\", Paste (magazine), 22 June 2007. Retrieved on 7 December 2017. That same year, Hegna again aided Amirpour by composing the music for her \\"Curing Cancer\\" episode of the National Geographic anthology series Breakthrough. Revolver Studio In 2003, Hegna opened Revolver Studios with Federale guitarist Nalin Silva above downtown Portland bar Kelly's Olympian, where Silva serves as booker and venue manager. The pair would relocate the studio to its current SE Portland locale three years later. The studio features a 600-square-foot tracking room, control room, two isolation booths, and an extensive collection of analog and digital recording equipment. Miracle Falls, the shoegaze project of Paul Dillon (former member of Mercury Rev, Longwave (band), Sparklehorse) and Jason \\"Plucky\\" Anchondo (The Warlocks, Spindrift), recorded their self-titled debut at Revolver. In interviews, Dillon has stated that he came to Portland specifically for the studio, and was enthusiastic with his praise. \\"Revolver is the perfect studio for me really. It's in a beautiful old building [that] has a big, live room with high ceilings, old hardwood floors, and natural light during the day, which helps avoid the dissociative 'bunker effect' that can sometimes happen when you're recording.\\" For the Shivas 2012 LP Whiteout, the PDX combo's third album and first on K Records, Hegna live-tracked the recordings on two-inch tape to best approximate the feel of a performance. He recorded, co-produced, and contributed vocals for Matthew J. Tow's 2013 solo debut, The Way of Things. The next year, Royston Vasie recorded their sophomore album Water Colours at Revolver during a five-day session helmed by Hegna. After an extended preparation for Habitual Love Song in his own basement studio, the third album from his Sons of Anarchy-feted folk-rock project Battleme, Matt Brenik came to Revolver with 20 demos. Although he had originally written the songs as piano ballads, he found they were energized in the process of recording with a full band, which included Hegna as bassist for the track \\"Post Is Dead\\". \\"I don't think the song would be the same without that monster bass riff,\\" Brenik told Paste magazine. \\"On the first record, there were only two players... this one was much more of a family affair.\\" Joel Gion, another longtime Brian Jonestown Massacre member, referred to Hegna as his primary collaborator during the creation of his self-titled 2017 release. \\"After listening to me talk about starting to write new songs, Collin offered me free studio time at his studio in Portland,\\" Gion said. \\"Then it suddenly became real before I even knew I was going to be able to do it.\\" Jsun Atoms was similarly effusive when discussing the producer with the press. \\"Collin‚Äôs Revolver Studios is perfect,\\" Atoms told the Britpop News. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve done a lot of work there the last few years.‚Äù \\"Collin Hegna is outright gifted,\\" he continued. \\"To get to work with those guys, I‚Äôm pinching myself each time ‚Ä¶ Having them both as friends that I can bounce ideas off of or collaborate with makes me feel like the luckiest guy in the world.\\" In 2010, The Upsidedown frontman went to Revolver to record that act's third full release, The Town with Bad Wiring. Hegna engineered the star-studded album whose guests included R.E.M.'s Peter Buck. Four years later, Atoms returned to the studio for subsequent band Daydream Machine's debut LP Twin Idols, on which Hegna played piano. \\"The Day That David Bowie Died\\" West Coast indie-rock contemporaries of Federale comprised the majority of Revolver's early clients, but the highest-profile release associated with the studio came from a British modern rock legend spurred by tragic circumstances toward an impromptu recording session. Shortly after sharing a bill with Federale during the northwest leg of his winter 2016 tour, modern rocker David J (Bauhaus, Love & Rockets) happened to be in Portland when he heard the news of David Bowie's 10 January demise. Within 24 hours, he contacted Hegna about using Revolver Studios to record \\"The Day That David Bowie Died\\". Beyond serving as producer and engineer, Hegna was also tasked with finding a set of studio musicians who could play their parts without preparation or notice. He enlisted members of Federale along with Paul Dillon and Dandy Warhols' touring guitarist Nathan Junior. Hegna would sent a demo along to Anton Newcombe, who released it later that year on his own A Records label. The ten-inch debuted at number four on the British vinyl singles chart. It also appears as the first track of J's 2017 double album Vagabond Songs, and David J often cited the recording of that song as a signal inspiration during interviews. \\"It was very pure and spontaneous,\\" he told Creative Loafing. \\"The musicians just heard the song once and did their part [on the] first take ‚Ä¶ it was a very poignant, sad, but joyous ‚Äî tears on the playback ‚Äî beautiful session.\\" References Category:Musicians from Portland, Oregon Category:Living people Category:The Brian Jonestown Massacre members Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Collin Hegna"},{"id":"17636289","text":"Industrial Development Consultants Ltd v Cooley [1972] 1 WLR 443 is a UK company law case on the corporate opportunities doctrine, and the duty of loyalty from the law of trusts. It is also applicable for fiduciary duty of an agent under agency law which states that an agent has a fiduciary relationship with his principal. This is a position which is similar to that of a trustee. Facts Mr Cooley was an architect employed as managing director of Industrial Development Consultants Ltd., part of IDC Group Ltd. The Eastern Gas Board had a lucrative project pending, to design a depot in Letchworth. Mr. Cooley was told that the gas board did not want to contract with a firm, but directly with him. Mr. Cooley then told the board of IDC Group that he was unwell and requested he be allowed to resign from his job on early notice. They acquiesced and accepted his resignation. He then undertook the Letchworth design work for the gas board on his own account. Industrial Development Consultants found out and sued him for breach of his duty of loyalty. Judgment Roskill J. held that even though there was no chance of IDC getting the contract, if they had been told they would not have released him. So he was held accountable for the benefits he received. He rejected the argument that because he made it clear in his discussions with the Gas Board that he was speaking in a private capacity, Mr. Cooley was under no fiduciary duty. He had ‚Äòone capacity and one capacity only in which he was carrying on business at that time. That capacity was as managing director of the plaintiffs.‚Äô All information which came to him should have been passed on. Roskill J, quoted, Parker v.

The judiciary is independent of the other two branches of government and is committed to guaranteeing fair trials and equality before the law. It has broad and effective powers of judicial review. Structurally, the Austrian judiciary is divided into general courts () and courts of public law (). The general courts handle civil and criminal trials as well as non-adversary proceedings such as inheritance cases or legal guardianship matters. The courts of public law supervise the other two branches of government: the administrative court system reviews the legality of administrative acts; the Constitutional Court adjudicates on complaints regarding the constitutionality of statutes, the legality of ordinances, and the conduct of elected officials and political appointees in office. In addition to the court system proper, the judicial arm of Austrian state power includes the state prosecution service (), the prisons () and the correctional officers' corps (). Remand prisons for pre-trial detention or other types of non-correctional custody () belong to the executive branch. The judiciary is assisted by the Ministry of Justice (), a cabinet-level division of the national executive.  Organization  The administration of justice in Austria is the sole responsibility of the federal government. Judges and prosecutors are recruited, trained, and employed by the Republic; courts hand down verdicts in the name of the Republic (). There is no such thing, for example, as an Austrian county court. The court system has two branches: * general courts () try criminal cases and (most) civil cases; * courts of public law () try (some of the) civil cases in which the respondent is a government authority: **the Constitutional Court () tries liability claims against the republic, a province, or a municipality and exercises judicial review of legislation; **a system of administrative courts () exercises judicial review of administrative actions. Judges are independent. Appointments are for life; judges cannot be removed or reassigned without their consent. In courts with more than one judge ‚àí which is essentially all of them ‚àí there has to be a fixed and specific apportionment of responsibilities () to prevent the government from influencing outcomes by hand-picking a judge sympathetic to its perspective. For example, if a litigant files for divorce in a court with multiple judges handling divorce cases, the first letter of their last name decides which judge they are assigned. Judges presiding over trials are professionals. In order to become eligible for appointment to a bench, a prospective judge needs to have a master's degree or equivalent in Austrian law, undergo four years of post- graduate training, and pass an exam. The training includes theoretical instruction and internship-type practical work in an actual courthouse. Appointments to benches are made by the president, although the president can and does delegate most of this responsibility to the minister of justice. Nominations come from within the judiciary; panels of judges suggest candidates for benches with vacancies. There is no military justice in peacetime; members of the military are tried by the regular court system.  Procedure  The seat of the Wels regional court Trials are oral and public. Civil trials are adversarial trials (). The court evaluates evidence brought before it by the parties to the trial but makes no attempt to uncover any additional evidence or otherwise investigate the matter itself. Criminal trials are inquisitorial trials (). The court is actively involved, questioning witnesses brought forward by the parties to the trials, summoning expert witnesses on its own initiative, and generally attempting to determine the truth. Most trials are bench trials, although the bench will often be a panel including one or more lay judges (). Criminal defendants accused of political transgressions or of serious crimes with severe penalties have a right to trial by jury. Pursuant to the European Convention on Human Rights, which has been adopted into the Austrian constitution, but also to Austrian constitutional law preceding it, criminal defendants are protected by the set of procedural guarantees typical for modern liberal democracies. Among other things, defendants * are presumed innocent until proven guilty; * have the right to a speedy trial; * cannot be tried in absentia; * cannot be forced to incriminate themselves; * cannot be tried for transgressions that are not specifically defined to be criminal offenses by statutory law, or that not specifically defined to be criminal offenses by statutory law (\\"nulla poena sine lege\\"); * cannot be prosecuted twice for the same crime, alleged or actual (\\"non bis in idem\\"); * have a right to an appeal. The right to an appeal is taken seriously. Any party to any trial before a general court can file an appeal on facts and law (). If the case is a civil case, the appellate court first checks whether the trial court has committed procedural errors; if yes, it orders a retrial, sending the case back to the trial court. If no, or if the case is criminal, the appellate court conducts what is essentially a retrial itself ‚àí the appellate trial does not merely review questions of law but also questions of fact, assessing evidence and questioning witnesses. In addition to the appeal on facts and law against the verdict of the trial court, an appeal at law ( in civil trials, in criminal cases) can be filed against the verdict of the appellate court. In criminal cases, appeals at law that are not obviously frivolous are also handled in public hearings. A successful appeal at law not just overturns but completely erases the verdict of the appellate court, sending the case down the ladder again. Verdicts of trial courts ‚àí although not of appellate courts ‚àí that result from the trial court's application of an unconstitutional statute or an illegal ordinance can additionally be fought with extraordinary appeals at law to the Constitutional Court.  General courts  The hierarchy of general courts has four levels: district, regional, higher regional, and supreme. For most cases, original jurisdiction lies with one of the district courts; its decision can be appealed to the relevant regional court. Some cases are first tried before the regional court and can be appealed to the higher regional court. Higher regional courts and the Supreme Court do not have original jurisdiction; they exclusively hear appeals. One of the peculiarities of the Austrian judiciary is its strict organizational separation of civil and criminal justice. Courts are divided into civil and criminal chambers; judges spend their days trying either civil cases or criminal cases but never both. In Vienna and in Graz ‚àí the country's two largest cities by a wide margin ‚àí the two chambers of the regional court are actually two completely separate courts, housed in separate buildings. In Vienna, there is a third regional court for trials at mercantile law () and a fourth regional court for cases involving employment and social assistance law (). Normally, original jurisdiction over disputes in these areas of law would lie with the civil regional court. As an additional special case, the higher regional court in Vienna has original jurisdiction over antitrust cases.  District courts  There are currently 115 district courts (). Most judicial districts are coextensive with one of the country's 94 administrative districts, although there are exceptions. Some of the larger administrative districts are partitioned into two of ore judicial districts. The extreme case is the City of Vienna, home to no fewer than 12 separate district courts. In some cases, a district court serving a city also serves part of the surrounding suburbs. In others, two or three very small administrative districts are lumped together into a single judicial zone. District courts are responsible for * civil trials () involving matrimonial and family matters, real estate rental or lease matters, real estate boundary or easement disputes, or trespass to land; * most simple debt collection, foreclosure, and bankruptcy matters; * other civil trials with the amount in dispute not exceeding EUR 15,000, excepting employment and social assistance disputes; * most criminal trials () involving finable offenses or jailable offenses with a jail term of no more than one year; * most non-adversary matters (), for example probate proceedings, adoptions, declarations of death in absentia, or invalidation of lost securities certificates; * most adversary non-trial matters (), including but not limited to child custody disputes, child maintenance and visitation rights disputes, appointments of legal guardians for senile elders or the mentally ill, or expropriation proceedings; * maintaining the land register. Trials before the district court are bench trials decided by a single judge (). Non-adversary proceedings, debt collection, foreclosure, bankruptcy, and land register matters can also be decided by a judiciary clerk (). While there are permanent district judges, there are no district . Criminal trials are prosecuted by a state attorney () attached to the relevant regional court. In minor cases, the public prosecutor can assign a district prosecutor () to substitute for them. The district prosecutor is not necessarily an attorney, however, and cannot act on their own initiative or authority.  Regional courts  Feldkirch regional court There are 18 regional courts () in Austria; their seats are in Eisenstadt, Feldkirch, Graz, Innsbruck, Klagenfurt, Korneuburg, Krems an der Donau, Leoben, Linz, Ried im Innkreis, Salzburg, Sankt P√∂lten, Steyr, Vienna, Wels, and Wiener Neustadt. In Graz and Vienna, the civil and criminal chambers set up as two separate courts, meaning that Graz and Vienna each have a civil regional court () and a criminal regional court (). Regional courts are responsible for * exercising original jurisdiction over all civil and criminal matters not handled by district courts; * hearing appeals on facts and law () against district court decisions; * keeping the company register. In cases for which the regional court has original jurisdiction, the trial is usually a bench trial decided by a single professional judge, but there are several exceptions: * Suits at employment law or social assistance law are decided by a panel of three judges, one professional judge () and two lay judges (). The lay judges are lay judges () and are effectively meant to double as court- appointed disinterested expert witnesses. * Other civil suits can be tried by three-judge panels upon request of the parties if the amount in dispute exceeds EUR 100,000. In cases at mercantile law, the panel consists of two professional judges and one expert lay judge ( here). In other cases, the panel consists of three professional judges. * Criminal trials are held before three-judge panels, four-judge panels, or juries in cases of alleged homicide, sexual assault, robbery, certain types of grand larceny or fraud, and in any case where the alleged crime carries a maximum jail term of more than five years. The specifics are somewhat involved; the following is a rough outline: ** Most of the cases outlined above go before a three-judge panel consisting of one professional judge and two lay judges (). ** In cases of alleged manslaughter, aggravated robbery, rape, membership in a terrorist organization, abuse of official authority, or financial crimes causing more than EUR 1,000,000 in damage, a second professional judge is added to the panel. ** Charges of murder, actual terrorist violence, or armed insurrection are jury trials decided by three professional judges and eight jurors (). The same is true for treason, a number of other political crimes, and all other crimes with minimum jail terms of more than five and maximum jail terms of more than ten years. In criminal trials, some effort is made to prevent panels and juries from being biased or unable to empathize with either defendants or alleged victims. If the crime alleged is a sexual assault or some other violation of a person's sexual integrity serious enough to warrant a panel, then at least one of the judges must belong to the same sex as the alleged victim. If there is a jury, then at least two of the jurors must be of the same sex as the alleged victim. If the defendant is juvenile and the alleged crime is serious enough to warrant a panel, then at least one of the judges must be of the same sex as the defendant and at least one of the judges must be a present or former educator or competent social worker. If there is a jury, at least two of the jurors must be of the relevant sex and at least four must have the relevant job experience. Appeals of district courts decisions to regional courts are decided by three-judge panels: two professional judges and one expert lay judge in trials at mercantile law, three professional judges in all other civil matters and in all criminal cases. Routine company register decisions are made by single judges or by judicial clerks. Attached to every regional court dealing with criminal trials, there is a branch of the state prosecution service () and a prison (). Regional courts and regional-level state prosecutors organize and supervise most of the pre-trial work () in Austria, even in cases in which the main court proceedings () are going to take place in a district court. In many ways, the regional courts are the backbone of the Austrian judiciary.  Higher regional courts  There are four higher regional courts (). They are located in Graz, Innsbruck, Linz, and Vienna. Higher regional courts decide appeals on facts and law () in cases originally tried before regional courts. As a special case, the higher regional court in Vienna decides antitrust disputes. Trials before higher regional courts are bench trials decided by panels of either three or five judges: three professional judges and two expert lay judges in employment and social assistance cases, two professional judges and one expert lay judge in all other civil cases, and three professional judges in all criminal trials. Each higher regional court has a chief public prosecutor's office ().  Supreme Court of Justice  The Palace of Justice, seat of the Supreme Court of Justice since 1881 The Supreme Court of Justice ( or ) hears appeals at law ( in civil trials, in criminal cases) against verdicts of appellate courts. The court also deals with service-related complaints by jurists against the judiciary and with disciplinary complaints against jurists; it acts as the trial court in cases involving certain senior judges and prosecutors, as an appeals court in cases involving lower-level judges and prosecutors, attorneys, and notaries. In addition to its adjudicative responsibilities, the court is charged with running the Republic's official public law library (the ). On the request of the president of the court or the minister of justice, the court produces appraisals of draft legislation presented to the National Council by the government. The court does not have a fixed number of justices; it consists of a president, a vice president, and as many additional members as Court and cabinet deem necessary and appropriate. As of the early 21st century, there are typically between fifty and sixty judges on the court. As of August 2018, there are 61. The court is partitioned into 18 panels () of five members each. One panel exclusively deals with appeals decisions reached by arbitration tribunals; another panel hears to appeals to antitrust verdicts handed down by the Vienna higher regional court, which has specialist exclusive jurisdiction over all Austrian antitrust cases. A third panel handles disciplinary proceedings and other disputes internal to the judiciary. Of the remaining fifteen panels, ten deal with civil cases and five with criminal trials. The responsibility for appointing justices is vested in the president, but the president can and usually does delegate this task to the minister of justice. The court maintains a special personnel committee (German: ) that provides the minister with a shortlist of three candidates in the event of a vacancy. In theory, the minister may appoint any Austrian legally qualified to sit the bench and not excluded by the constitution's rudimentary incompatibility provisions. In practice, the minister dependably picks one of the three candidates nominated by the court. The Supreme Court of Justice convenes in the Palace of Justice in Vienna.  Courts of public law  The Austrian model of separation of powers forbids the administrative and judicial branches of government from interfering with each other. This peculiarity, established during the neo-absolutist years of the Habsburg monarchy, originally meant that subjects could not take bureaucrats to court or otherwise petition the courts to review the legality of administrative acts. The Constitution of 1920 fixes this problem by establishing the Administrative Court and the Constitutional Court, two tribunals that cut across the division. Pointedly called instead of simply , the two tribunals are staffed by lawyer judges and generally behave like courts without technically courts. The terminology used by most modern English-language literature makes the distinction difficult to see; it remains salient in German texts. Broadly speaking, the administrative court system reviews administrative acts, the Constitutional Court reviews legislative acts and judicial demarcation conflicts.  Administrative court system   Constitutional Court  The seat of the Constitutional Court The Constitutional Court ( or ) adjudicates on * liability claims against Austria, its provinces, and its municipalities; * demarcation conflicts between courts, between courts and the administration, and between national and regional governments; * the constitutionality of statutes and the legality of ordinances and other secondary legislation; * the legality of international treaties; * election complaints; * accusations of misconduct in office against certain elected officials and political appointees; * complaints alleging violations of constitutional rights or the rule of law by the executive branch. The Constitutional Court is the only court in Austria with the power of judicial review of legislation. The Austrian method of vesting all power to strike legislation in a single specialist court is called the system of judicial review. Because Austria was the first country to adopt this approach when Hans Kelsen created the Constitutional Court in its modern form with the 1920 Kelsen constitution, the approach is sometimes also called the system. Because the approach has since spread to Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and Belgium, some people call it the approach. Legislation can be challenged before the Constitutional Court by any private person, natural or other. The complaint has to argue that the complainant is being violated in their rights by the piece of legislation at issue, actually and not just potentially. The complaint also has to argue that there is no plausible way for the complainant to get the problem resolved through any other procedure. Depending on the type of the statute, ordinance, or treaty, the court can often also be called upon by the national government, by regional governments, or by groups of national or regional legislators. Legislation can also be challenged by courts that are trying cases for whose outcome it is relevant. Legislation can further be challenged by one of the parties to the a trial, but only after the trial court has handed down its verdict and only if the verdict actually references the piece of legislation in question. Verdicts by administrative trial courts can additionally be challenged on the grounds that they violate the relevant party's constitutional rights in some other way. This possibility lets the Constitutional Court exercise judicial review not just of ordinances but also of individual-scope actions of the executive branch: A citizen who feels violated in their constitutional rights by an administrative decision or assessment files suit in an administrative court. If the administrative court agrees with the complainant, it overrules the administration. If the administrative court does not, the complainant can escalate the matter to the Constitutional Court. If the Constitutional Court agrees with the complainant, it overrules the administrative court, prompting a retrial; it thus potentially also overrules the administration. Unlike the Supreme Court of Justice and the Supreme Administrative Court, the Constitutional Court is not a court of appeals. It only hears cases it has original jurisdiction over, although the way Austria uses general and administrative courts to vet complaints about unconstitutional legislation and other constitutional rights infringements does present something of an edge case. The Constitutional Court consists of fourteen members and six substitute members, appointed by the president on nomination of the cabinet, the National Council, and the Federal Council. In theory, trials before the Constitutional Court are oral, public, and decided by the full plenum. In practice, oral argument and true plenary sessions have become rare because workload is heavy and there are broad exceptions to these general rules; most cases today are decided behind closed doors by panels of either nine or five members. Opinions tend to be concise and academic. Only the actual decision is published; there are no concurring or dissenting opinions.  History   March Constitution  Revolutions of 1848 set Austria on the path from absolute to constitutional monarchy. In its modern form, the Austrian judiciary goes back to the March Constitution of 1849. Throughout the 18th and early 19th century, the Habsburgs had tried to rule as absolute monarchs, holding unrestricted power over their subjects with no constraints due to any kind of feudal social compact and with no interference from any of the estates of their various realms. The Revolutions of 1848 compelled a first step towards constitutional rule. Under intense pressure, Emperor Ferdinand tried to appease the revolutionaries by enacting the Pillersdorf Constitution, a statute that promised increased civil liberties, a limited form of democratic participation in government, and access to independent courts with the power to review administrative acts and halt administrative overreach. Although the document as a whole was fairly short, one of its seven sections was a substantial bill of rights that was modern for the time. The appeasement failed to stem the crisis; Ferdinand had to abdicate. His successor, Franz Joseph succeeded in ending the protests by promulgating the March Constitution, a set of edicts that built on the Pillersdorf Constitution but included a number of additional concessions. The constitution established a number of principles that remain in force until the present day: * The judicial powers and responsibilities of landlords, cities, and ecclesiastical corporations are abolished; all disputes are adjudicated by the State, in courts explicitly created by statutory law and according to procedure explicitly set forth in statutory law. (¬ß20, ¬ß100) * Justices have judicial independence. (¬ß101) * Judiciary and executive are separate powers; court system and bureaucracy cannot squash each other's decisions or otherwise interfere in each other's domains. (¬ß102) * Criminal trials are inquisitorial trials (). While the judge is tasked with actively searching for the truth as opposed to merely refereeing, however, judge and prosecutor are separate entities. The older form of inquisitorial system, in which judge and prosecutor are the same party ( proper in German) is no longer used. (¬ß103) * Trials are oral and public. (¬ß103) * Political trials are jury trials. (¬ß103) Subsequent legislation pursuant to the March Constitution created a court system that also survives, with a few significant but narrow alterations, until this day. Most notably, the outline defined by the constitution was fleshed by the Constitution of the courts ( or ) of 1849 and the Penal Procedure Code ( or ) of 1850: * The court system is a hierarchy with five levels: district, district collegiate, regional, higher regional, and supreme; (¬ß1 GVG, ¬ß8 StPO) ** District courts (); ** District collegiate courts (); ** Regional courts (); ** Higher regional courts (); ** Supreme Court () * District courts are trial courts with single judges handling civil disputes and minor misdemeanors. (¬ß¬ß2‚àí9 GVG, ¬ß9 StPO) * District collegiate courts are trial courts with panels of judges trying more serious transgressions. (¬ß¬ß10‚àí11 GVG, ¬ß¬ß10‚àí13 StPO) * Regional courts are trial courts with panels of judges trying serious crimes, in some cases assisted by juries, but also appellate courts hearing appeals to verdicts of district and district collegiate courts in their respective regions. (¬ß¬ß12‚àí18 GVG, ¬ß¬ß14‚àí16 StPO) * Higher regional courts and the Supreme Court only have appellate jurisdiction. * A professional body of state attorneys () represents the State in court where necessary; most notably, the state attorney's offices act as a professional prosecution service, charging defendants and presenting the case against them before the judge. Regional and higher courts have state attorneys' offices attached to them; the state attorneys working at the regional court level are the backbone of the service. Trials before district courts are usually handled through assistants and proxies. (¬ß29 GVG, ¬ß¬ß51‚àí60 StPO) * Appeals are limited. Verdicts in civil cases can be appealed up only once; verdicts in criminal cases can be appealed up twice. Appeals in point of law and pleas in nullity may still be possible even when regular appeals are exhausted, but the specifics are complicated. (¬ß2 GVG, ¬ß¬ß352‚àí390 StPO) The main differences between the court system of the March Constitution and the court system as it exists today are the district collegiate courts, since abolished, the comparatively wide purview of the state attorneys, since narrowed, and the fact that there is no judicial review. The separation of powers between judiciary and executive was complete; courts could not overrule the bureaucracy just as the bureaucracy could not overrule the courts. The also was no mechanism for courts to squash unconstitutional legislation. The need for a judicial review of laws was simply not felt at the time. In modern Austria, the main seat of power () is the legislature and the Constitutional Court is the monitoring authority acting as a check on it. In the philosophical framework of 19th-century Austria, the imperial court was the main seat of power and was meant to be the monitoring authority.  Return to absolutism  Emperor Franz Joseph spent much of his early reign trying to reassert unqualified sovereignty. Since the March Constitution was () by the crown as opposed to enacted by the people or agreed upon by the empire's constituent crown lands, Franz Joseph felt at liberty to walk back on his promises as soon as he had regained a firm grip on his subjects. The Constitution () was abrogated in 1852 and replaced with a number of \\"constitutional principles\\" () that sounded vaguely progressive but did not actually bind the ruling house to any real degree. Franz Joseph was trying to return to absolutist rule. Jury trials were abolished. A complete rewrite of the Penal Procedure Code in 1853 reintroduced old-style inquisitorial trials. Judges lost their independence. State attorneys continued to exist but lost most of their responsibilities; they were essentially reduced to their function as public prosecutors, and comparatively powerless ones at that. Trials were no longer public. Trials before higher regional courts and the supreme court were no longer oral. On the district level, the separation of powers was abandoned, at least on paper. District courts were merged into district administrative offices, although in practice district judges continued to operate much as they had before. The return to absolutism ultimately failed. The continuing rise of civic nationalism and continuing demands by Austria's Hungarian and Slavic subjects for material autonomy, exacerbated by a series of diplomatic setbacks, kept eroding the cohesion of the empire and the personal authority of the Emperor. By 1861, Franz Joseph was forced to grant a third constitution. Following his defeat in the Austro- Prussian War in 1866, he was forced to give up for good on his desire to remain the sole sovereign and font of law. In the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, the Kingdom of Hungary received near-complete independence. Shortly thereafter, the remainder of the empire received the December Constitution, a fourth and final set of fundamental laws that the Emperor would no longer be able to unilaterally scrap.  December Constitution  As far as civil and criminal jurisprudence was concerned, the December Constitution mostly just resurrected the principles originally stipulated in 1849. Judges regained their autonomy and independence, although state attorneys remained limited to their narrow role as prosecutors. The constitution restored full separation of powers, including on the district level. District courts, accordingly, were detached from district administrative offices again. District collegiate courts, on the other hand, were not; they were simply abandoned. The system of general courts now had the same four rungs it still has today: * District courts (); * Regional courts (now called instead of ); * Higher regional courts (still called ); * Supreme Court (). The December Constitution did more than merely revive suspended institutions, however. One of its parts, the Basic Law on the General Rights of Nationals () was a second bill of rights that was a significant improvement over its 1848 precursor. Other parts of the constitution entrenched the rule of law and made it clear that Habsburg subjects would from now on be able to take the State to court should it violate their fundamental rights. Since regular courts were still unable to overrule the bureaucracy, much less the legislature, these guarantees necessitated the creation of specialist courts that could: * The Administrative Court (), stipulated by the 1867 Basic Law on Judicial Power () and implemented in 1876, had the power to review the legality of administrative acts, ensuring that the executive branch remained faithful to the principle of the rule of law. * The Imperial Court (), stipulated by the Basic Law on the Creation of an Imperial Court () in 1867 and implemented in 1869, decided demarcation conflicts between courts and the bureaucracy, between its constituent crown lands, and between one of the crown lands and the Empire itself. It also adjudicated on financial liability claims raised by crown lands against each other, by a crown land against the Empire, by the Empire against a crown land, or by a person, corporation, or municipality against a crown land or the Empire. Last but not least, the Imperial Court also heard complaints of citizens who alleged to have been violated in their constitutional rights, although its powers were not cassatory: it could only vindicate the complainant by the government to be in the wrong, not by actually voiding its wrongful decisions. * The State Court () held the Emperor's ministers accountable for political misconduct committed in office. The State Court was an oblique and roundabout way of keeping the Emperor himself in check. The Emperor could not be taken to court, but under the terms of the Law on the Responsibility of Ministers () of 1867 he was no longer an autocrat; many of his decrees and injunctions now depended on the relevant minister to countersign them. The double-pronged approach of making the Emperor dependent on his ministers and also making ministers criminally liable for bad outcomes would firstly enable, secondly motivate the ministers to put pressure on the monarch. The statute in question actually predates the Constitution by a few months, but the Constitution conspicuously failed to abrogate it; it also expressly confirmed the legal inviolability of the person of the Emperor himself. The December Constitution thus created the distinction between general courts and courts of public law.  First Republic  The December Constitution remained in force essentially unaltered until the end of the Habsburg Monarchy in 1918. The end of Austria-Hungary was not a collapse so much as an explosion. Hungary broke away from Austria. The Slavic peoples of Austria broke away from the German-speaking heartland, all essentially at the same time, and started establishing the nation states they had been demanding for decades. The German-speaking remnant was demoralized, rudderless, and crippled by partisan strife. The monarchy was discredited and its administration with it. None of the rump state's various legislative bodies had any real authority either. Provincial legislatures had been elected using a system of curia suffrage, meaning they had no democratic legitimacy. The House of Deputies, the lower chamber of the Imperial Council, had been elected democratically, but the last election had been held in 1911. Political left and political right agreed that Austria should become a democratic republic but had fundamentally different ideas regarding many other aspects of their future constitutional framework. In acknowledgment of their questionable standing, the remaining deputies decided to meet not as the House of Deputies but as the Provisional National Assembly. The Assembly would only make decisions that could not be delayed; it would retain as much as possible of the existing body of constitutional law until general elections could be held and a properly legitimized Constituting National Assembly could be convoked. In particular, the Provisional Assembly made no drastic changes to the court system; it mainly updated the system of courts of public law: * The Administrative Court was retained. * The State Court was disbanded. In its original form, it was pointless without a monarch in possession of permanent and unqualified immunity; besides, it had never actually convened. The responsibility for holding top officials accountable was transferred to a special committee of the Provisional National Assembly. * The Imperial Court was renamed to Constitutional Court (). In April 1919, the government transferred the responsibilities of the former State Court to the Constitutional Court and also gave the Constitutional Court cassatory power: from now on, the court could not just the unconstitutionality of an administrative decision, it could actually annul it, sending complainant and defendant back to square one. * A special Election Court () was created to handle complaints regarding the upcoming Constituting Assembly election. The only other significant change involved the Supreme Court: its name was shortened to its modern form. The new, permanent Kelsen constitution of 1920 finally gave the Constitutional Court the power of judicial review. The court was now able to void regulations that violated the law and laws that violated the constitution. It also acquired responsibility for handling election complaints; the Kelsen constitution did not retain the Election Court. Austrian courts other than the Constitutional Court have no power of judicial review to this day; they cannot strike or refuse to apply laws they consider unconstitutional, although they can (and are required to) refuse to apply laws they think have not been constitutionally enacted or promulgated. A court that suspects a statute at issue may be unconstitutional has the right (and the obligation) to refer the matter to the Constitutional Court. The literature calls this approach the system of judicial review. Because Austria was in fact the first country ever to adopt this system and because it has since spread to Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and Belgium, it is also called the \\"Austrian\\" or \\"European\\" model. The Revisions of 1925 and 1929 made no further changes to the court system.

In 1933 she underwent repairs and a complete refit; her mast was shortened to improve stability and her artillery director was removed. In 1939, the ship was used in the film Der letzte Apell as the British scout cruiser Amphion; two additional dummy funnels were added.  Wartime career  During the Invasion of Poland in September 1939, Bremse escorted the auxiliary minelayers Tannenberg and Hansestadt Danzig and in October, she escorted troop transports in the Baltic. She then returned to the artillery school in Kiel until March 1940. In April 1940, during Operation Weser√ºbung, Bremse participated in the attack on Bergen. She was shelled by Norwegian coastal artillery and hit by two 21 cm rounds; she was subsequently repaired in Stavanger.

It includes texts and images by authors and artists, presenting themes on specific countries, literature, art theory or politics, along with interviews, polemics, book and theatre reviews and works of photography on 112 pages.  History  The magazine was founded in 1969 and originally developed as a project by a group of authors from the Vienna 68er-Bewegung. The twenty-year-old writers Peter Henisch und Helmut Zenker initially founded Wespennest as a publication for their own texts, dissociated from the literary magazine Literatur und Kritik, which they found \\"too virtuous\\", and Manuskripte, which they found \\"too avant-garde\\". After the founding authors resigned, other writers including Gustav Ernst and Franz Schuh, worked as editors and co-publishers of Wespennest for many years. In the mid-1980s, Josef Haslinger altered the concept of the quarterly magazine. In addition to German-language literature and essays, it began to publish regular translations of foreign authors who were not well known in the German- speaking world. A collaboration was also formed with the European network of cultural journals Eurozine, which Wespennest helped to found. Walter Famler, the magazine‚Äôs current publisher, expanded the magazine‚Äôs activities at the beginning of the 1990s to include book publishing, coming out with three to five books a year in the series Edition Literatur, Edition Essay and Edition Film. Founded as a literary magazine, Wespennest now includes works on the humanities and social sciences. It regularly publishes critical essays on topics of contemporary art and film, and coverage of political and social events in and outside Austria. The 100th issue, which appeared in September 1995, included further content and design changes by Stefan Fuhrer. Articles appear under the heading Wespennest Portraits, which has included articles on Drago Janƒçar, D≈æevad Karahasan, John Mateer and Meg Stuart. The articles aim to maintain a connection between photographs and text. The magazine is published under a distribution agreement with the Munich-based publishing house C.H. Beck. It aims to provide a literary forum and a critical public for authors, who have included Friedrich Achleitner, Gabriela Adame≈üteanu, Gennadij Ajgi, Sadik Al-Azm, Les Back, Lothar Baier, Colette Braeckman, Alida Bremer, Rudolf Burger, Mircea CƒÉrtƒÉrescu, Peter O.

The forum for European literature has had contributions from Spain, the Netherlands, Greece and Scandinavia, and discusses the literature of Eastern Europe. Four themed issues are published each year, with occasional special editions, such as those about the jazz composer Franz Koglmann, the poet Friederike Mayr√∂cker and the Art Brut artist Adolf W√∂lfli. The magazine was awarded the V.O. Stomps Prize from the city of Mainz in 2003, for \\"outstanding achievements in small- scale publishing activities\\".  Editorial board  Since 2014 Andrea Roedig and Andrea Zederbauer edit the magazine along with Walter Famler, Erich Klein, Jan Koneffke (literature), Tanja Martini (¬´√ºberl√§ufer¬ª), Reinhard √ñhner (photos), and Ilija Trojanow (reportage).

It is a Geological Conservation Review site. Prehistory The location was formed when a melting ice sheet at the end of the last ice age uncovered hardened silt deposited when the area was part of the Wealden Lake. There are traces of Middle Stone Age and Iron Age residents, including a 1st-century A.D. fort guarding against the Roman invasion. Recent history After King James II visited Tunbridge Wells and made the woodland a resort in the 17th century, High Rocks became a tourist attraction which also offered a maze, a bowling green, gambling rooms and cold baths. The Aerial Walk, a series of bridges linking the tops of the crags, was built in the 19th century. A halt served by the local railway was established in 1907, and was used until 1952. The Spa Valley Railway, a heritage railway, now connects the High Rocks pub beyond the High Rocks turnstiles to Tunbridge Wells, Groombridge and Eridge (on the London-Uckfield line of Southern Railway). Geology and geomorphology High Rocks is a key geomorphological site for sandstone weathering features developed on the highest cliffs in the Weald. The Ardingly Sandstone has suffered gentle deformation, and joints have opened out to form spectacular gulls (tension cracks) which are wide enough in places for a person to enter. Open gulls are comparatively rare in Britain, except in the central Weald, and they are nowhere better revealed than in the numerous open passages at High Rocks. The Ardingly Sandstone is friable and poorly cemented, but the surface develops a protective crust and displays a variety of micro-weathering features, notably honeycombing and polygonal cracking. The origin of this cracking is problematic but may relate to freezing and thawing under periglacial conditions during the Pleistocene. This type of cracking is found in Britain only on the sandstone outcrops in the central Weald, and is most strikingly displayed at High Rocks.

Paxton and Tobey are then caught living together by Tobey's parents at their family house in Provincetown. Following a fight between Tobey and her mother, the two separate for the last two weeks of summer break. Tobey, by now deeply in love, is ecstatic to be with Paxton upon their return to school. While out on his motorcycle, Paxton has a chance encounter with a young artist in need of a ride; their meeting is quite sexually charged. The young artist, Eulice (Judy Pace), another Fulton student, entreats Paxton to let her paint him naked. When she is finished, Paxton learns that she only wanted to paint his face, but got him naked for fun. She promises to get nude for Paxton as compensation. After a meal, they retire to a motel that Paxton frequents with his many different conquests. Following his initial escapade with Eulice, Paxton brags to his fraternity brothers that he feels no remorse. While they are on a trip to a cabin, Tobey asks Paxton to move out of his fraternity house and move into an apartment with her. Paxton overreacts; Tobey explains that her father bet her that if she rented an apartment for the two of them Paxton would get cold feet and end the relationship. A bitter fight ensues, but they soon make up. Paxton receives a phone call from Eulice at his fraternity house, and is goaded into seeing her again. While racing over to Eulice's residence Paxton trips and happens upon a hippie-girl, Jan (Maggie Thrett), who is making a flower-collage in the woods. They strike up a conversation, and soon after, Paxton takes Jan to his favorite motel. The two eat some of Jan's \\"magic-brownies\\" and then Jan uses body paint to cover Paxton's back in flowers. As soon as Paxton makes a move, Jan runs for the door. Paxton aggressively attacks her, and then stops and feigns to be homosexual who was abused by a junior high school coach. This exploitative trickery wins her sympathy and they soon become intimate. Again, Paxton brags about his exploits back at his fraternity house. One of his brothers gives him the idea of dating all three girls at the same time. They scheme over some beers, and come up with an elaborate plan for Paxton to trick all three girls into thinking he is seeing each one exclusively. While at a movie which Paxton is watching with Tobey, he is almost discovered by both Eulice and Jan, who spot him from the front; he barely escapes detection. Paxton returns to the Zeta Chi house and walks into a party where brothers are taking advantage of a drunken co-ed. Paxton, hit with a sudden sense of guilt, tries to protect the girl from the brothers' jeers. Paxton, filled with his new-found conscience, rents an apartment for himself and Tobey and goes to her dorm building to surprise her with his new level of commitment. Tobey, obviously very distraught, tells Paxton to follow her into her attic, where she reveals that Eulice, Jan, and she have discovered Paxton's secret infidelity. Tobey caught him after seeing Eulice's painting of Paxton at an art show and tracking down the artist. The three then lock Paxton in the attic and plan to continue sleeping with him constantly to physically wear him out as a punishment. Paxton rebels by going on a hunger strike. After noticing his drop in class attendance, the dean of Willard College sends out a description of Paxton to neighboring colleges, labeling him as a missing student. A nosy dorm mate of Tobey's notices the actions of Paxton's captors and reports them to the assistant dean of Fulton. Meanwhile, Paxton is being worn to physical extremes from a combination of nearly two weeks of malnutrition and being unable to resist the relentless advances of Tobey, Eulice, and Jan. The assistant dean of Fulton, Dean Nazarin (Nan Martin), connects information listed in a missing person's report and information from a nosy student. She then concludes that Paxton is being held in the attic of Fulton's Ford Hall, Tobey's residence. Tobey meets with Dean Nazarin and explains the situation. Although unable to officially condone the actions of the young women, the dean offers a chance for Tobey to carry out Paxton's \\"punishment\\" while turning a blind eye. Meanwhile, Paxton has vivid hallucinations where he accuses his three captors and fantasizes that they are unanimously hated by all of Fulton College while he is shown love and comfort. Failing to make Paxton explain his actions, Tobey finally consents to release him from the attic, and disoriented, he stumbles into an unsuspecting female dorm. He is attacked by the female residents as an intruder and knocked unconscious. An ambulance soon takes him away. Due to intervention from Dean Nazarin, the three girls get out of the scandal without punishment. With the help of Eulice, Paxton is then able to chase down Tobey before she leaves town on a bus, and reconciles with her after a desperate display of love.

The original title was Paxton Quigley's Had the Course. Filming started in February 1968. It was the film debut of John Beck. The title sequence was designed by Sandy Dvore. Music British duo Chad & Jeremy recorded original songs and instrumental backing music for the film. The soundtrack album contains the duo's own version of \\"Paxton's Song (Smoke)\\", which Jones sang in the film. The album was released in the U.S. on Sidewalk Records in 1969, with a CD reissue by Curb Records in 2013. Response Critical Three in the Attic was released to mixed reviews. Roger Ebert gave the film two stars, claiming the film was unable to live up to its promising concept. Ebert did single out Judy Pace's Eulice as one of the film's few highlights. Variety gave the movie a very poor review, noting that even writer Stephen Yafa disowned the picture. Their review claims the film was harmed by amateurish acting, \\"littered with padding optical effects, hampered by uneven dramatic concept, and redundant in its too-delicious sex teasing.\\" The South Building as seen from Cameron Avenue in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.

Due to the film's success, Wilson then signed a seven-picture deal with Universal. Jones was announced for another AIP film called We Outnumber You but the film was never made. In 1974 Samuel Z. Arkoff said the film was AIP's highest grossing to that point. He put this down to \\"the theme of the picture\\" saying Jones \\"should have been a big star but got sidetracked by some... nervous problems.\\" Film location Much of Three in the Attic was filmed at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.

Commissioned Ships and Crafts. BRP Sultan Kudarat was decommissioned on July 5, 2019. Technical details There are slight differences between the BRP Sultan Kudarat as compared to some of her sister ships in the Philippine Navy, since her previous configuration was as a patrol craft escort (PCE), while the others are configured as rescue patrol craft escort (PCER) and minesweepers (Admirable class) ships. Armaments Originally the ship was armed with one Mk.26 3\\"/50 caliber dual purpose gun, three single Bofors 40 mm guns, one Hedgehog depth charge projector, four depth charge projectiles (K-guns) and two depth charge tracks. Changes were made during its transfer to the South Vietnamese Navy, as it appears in photos show the removal of her anti- submarine weapons, and addition of four Mk.10 Oerlikon 20 mm guns. This made the ship lighter and ideal for surface patrols, but losing her limited anti- submarine warfare capability. The same configuration applies when she was transferred to the Philippine Navy up until around 1990‚Äì1991. During its overhaul and refit between 1990 and 1991, the Philippine Navy made some changes in the armament set-up. Some sources claim the loss of its three Bofors 40mm cannons during the 1990‚Äì1991 overhaul and refit period, but photos as of 2009 show the Bofors guns still present. Final armaments fitted to the ship are one Mk.26 3\\"/50-caliber gun (fore), three single Bofors 40 mm cannons (aft), four Mk.10 Oerlikon 20 mm cannons (2 each on bridge wings), and four M2 Browning .50 cal (12.7 mm) caliber machine guns (2 besides main bridge, 2 aft near the lower Bofors gun tub). Electronics Also during the refit the ship's RCA CRM-NIA-75 surface search radar and RCA SPN-18 navigation radar was replaced by a Raytheon AN/SPS-64(V)11 surface search and navigation radar system. Later modifications included the installation of an additional Furuno navigation radar, long range and satellite communications system and GPS system standard to all Philippine Navy ships.

Biography  Friedrich von Rabenau was born in Berlin to the physician Friedrich von Rabenau (1847‚Äì1885) and Wally, n√©e Noebel. He joined the Prussian Army in 1903 as a member of the 72nd Field Artillery Regiment (stationed at Danzig), served in World War I, and remained in the Weimar-German Reichswehr.Biography at Neue Deutsche Biographie In 1936, von Rabenau was assigned by the then head of the general staff, Generaloberst Ludwig August Theodor Beck, to establish (from the Reichsarchiv) the first central archive of the German army, in Potsdam. Well suited to the task, Rabenau strove to prevent ideological falsifications with a scientific diligence in gathering sources that was second to none. His Christian beliefs led him to join the opposition to Nazism early. Von Rabenau was a Rechtsritter (Knight of Justice) in the supradenominational Order of Saint John.Robert M. Clark, Jr., The Evangelical Knights of Saint John: A History of the Bailiwick of Brandenburg; Dallas, Texas: 2003; page 45. As a Protestant Christian and a general, he successfully applied to then Reichsf√ºhrer SS Heinrich Himmler for permission to take over Maria Laach Abbey, which had been seized from Roman Catholic Cardinal Graf von Galen in M√ºnster. Von Rabenau joined no resistance group, though he did act as a conduit between Generaloberst Ludwig Beck and Carl Friedrich Goerdeler, whom he knew from his time as an Abteilungskommandeur (Section Commander) in K√∂nigsberg (now Kaliningrad). In mid-1942 von Rabenau was relieved of his office, transferred to the F√ºhrerreserve (a classification for high-ranking officers who were without billet which was often used by Hitler to push aside officers with whom he was displeased) at his current rank of General der Artillerie (General of the Artillery), and thus sent into premature retirement. He studied protestant theology at the University of Berlin and in 1943 was made Licentiatus theologiae, writing his dissertation on military chaplaincy.Nachlass im Bundesarchiv Von Rabenau was arrested in the aftermath of the plot which culminated in the attempt on Hitler's life on 20 July 1944. On 15 April 1945, without having been charged or tried, General von Rabenau, one of the last inmates remaining in the Flossenb√ºrg concentration camp, was shot on Himmler's specific orders. The execution order was issued by Gestapo Chief Heinrich M√ºller with additional orders to report his death as resulting from a low-flying allied air attack. The Flossenburg Memorial erroneously gives von Rabenau's date of judicial murder as 9 April 1945. He was survived by his wife Eva Kautz and their two daughters.

It was built on the site of the Brighton B Power Station. Predating both the former Brighton A & B stations, the town of Brighton has a long history of association with the electricity supply industry. History Gloucester Road Power Station Brighton was one of the first towns in the UK to have a continuous supply of electricity. In 1882 Robert Hammond established the Hammond Electric Light Company and on the 27 February 1882 he opened the Gloucester Road Power Station. It was set up in the yard of Reed's Iron Foundry, and consisted of a Brush dynamo, driven by a Robey engine. This was used to power sixteen arc lamps on a circuit around the town centre, operating from dusk until 11pm every day. In spring 1883 another dynamo was brought into operation, powered by a Marshall engine, powering a 40 lamp circuit. In 1885 the Hammond Electric Light Company went into voluntary liquidation, and the system was bought by the Brighton Electric Light Company who registered on 16 December 1885. It further extended the system, building a new station on the same site, consisting of three 40-lamp Brush dynamos, powered by a Fowler engine. This station was later extended by another two Brush dynamos and another Fowler engine. By January 1886 the company's system had increased to include 1,000 filament lamps on of circuit, and in 1887, it was decided for the company to provide a day time service. A 16-lamp dynamo and a Hornsby engine were installed to take the day-time load. In the same year, the system was switched from DC to AC, and electricity was generated at 1,800 volts (V) using single-phase Elwell Parker and Mordey alternators. Voltage was reduced to 100 V by Lowrie-Hall transformers mounted on customers' rooftops. By 1887, 34 arc lamps and 1,500 filament lamps were being supplied by five Brush dynamos, on a system of overhead lines. In 1890 the company became the Brighton and Hove Electric Light Company. North Road Power Station The local authority, the Brighton Corporation, had obtained a provisional order allowing them to generate electricity in 1883 but had never the need to exercise it. However, in 1890 it acquired the site for a power station and opened its own municipal North Road Power Station on 14 September 1891. It supplied at 115 V DC, using four Willans-Goolden generating sets, two at 45 kilowatts (kW) and two at 120 kW, provided with steam by three Lancashire boilers. Another two Willans engines driving 240 kW dynamos were added later. In 1894, the Brighton Corporation bought out the Brighton and Hove Electric Light Company. By 1904 the North Road station's capacity was at 5,935 kW, with six Lancashire boilers and ten Babcock & Wilcox boilers, steaming nineteen Willans engines, coupled directly to DC generators. It was decided a larger station would be needed, and the site was chosen at Southwick. When this station was opened in 1906 the old station became less required, and so in 1908 North Road station was closed down. Brighton A Power Station The construction on the Southwick power station commenced in 1904, its site chosen because of its position on the harbour, meaning plentiful supply of water for cooling, and access to seaborne coal. The first phase of the station opened in June 1906, with a generating capacity of 5,470 kW. The station was given various modifications and extensions, and by 1946 it had a capacity of 190 megawatts (MW). By 1961 the station had an installed capacity of 190 MW, comprising 1 √ó 30 MW, 2 √ó 37.5 MW and 1 √ó 50 MW turbo- alternators.CEGB Statistical Yearbook (various dates 1964-1975). CEGB, London. The turbines were supplied with steam from 10 boilers: 4 √ó 160,000 lb/hr (20.2 kg/s), 4 √ó 215,000 lb/hr (27.1 kg/s) and 2 √ó 350,000 lb/hr (44.1 kg/s). The boilers were chain grate, pulverised coal and retort stoker designs. The total steam output was 2,200,000 lb/hr (277.2 kg/s) and the steam conditions at the turbine stop valves were 350/650 psi (24.1/44.8 bar) and 399/454¬∞C. Seawater was used for condensing and cooling. The output, in GWh, of the A station over the period 1961-75 was as follows:CEGB Annual report and Accounts, 1961, 1962 & 1963{ \\"version\\": 2, \\"width\\": 500, \\"height\\": 200, \\"data\\": [ { \\"name\\": \\"table\\", \\"values\\": [ { \\"x\\": 1961, \\"y\\": 126 }, { \\"x\\": 1964, \\"y\\": 249 }, { \\"x\\": 1965, \\"y\\": 311 }, { \\"x\\": 1966, \\"y\\": 237 }, { \\"x\\": 1967, \\"y\\": 180 }, { \\"x\\": 1968, \\"y\\": 164 }, { \\"x\\": 1969, \\"y\\": 100 }, { \\"x\\": 1970, \\"y\\": 72 }, { \\"x\\": 1971, \\"y\\": 72 }, { \\"x\\": 1972, \\"y\\": 63 }, { \\"x\\": 1973, \\"y\\": 9 }, { \\"x\\": 1974, \\"y\\": 16 }, { \\"x\\": 1975, \\"y\\": 2 }, { \\"x\\": 1962, \\"y\\": 202 }, { \\"x\\": 1963, \\"y\\": 293 } ] } ], \\"scales\\": [ { \\"name\\": \\"x\\", \\"type\\": \\"ordinal\\", \\"range\\": \\"width\\", \\"zero\\": false, \\"domain\\": { \\"data\\": \\"table\\", \\"field\\": \\"x\\" } }, { \\"name\\": \\"y\\", \\"type\\": \\"linear\\", \\"range\\": \\"height\\", \\"nice\\": true, \\"domain\\": { \\"data\\": \\"table\\", \\"field\\": \\"y\\" } } ], \\"axes\\": [ { \\"type\\": \\"x\\", \\"scale\\": \\"x\\" }, { \\"type\\": \\"y\\", \\"scale\\": \\"y\\" } ], \\"marks\\": [ { \\"type\\": \\"rect\\", \\"from\\": { \\"data\\": \\"table\\" }, \\"properties\\": { \\"enter\\": { \\"x\\": { \\"scale\\": \\"x\\", \\"field\\": \\"x\\" }, \\"y\\": { \\"scale\\": \\"y\\", \\"field\\": \\"y\\" }, \\"y2\\": { \\"scale\\": \\"y\\", \\"value\\": 0 }, \\"fill\\": { \\"value\\": \\"steelblue\\" }, \\"width\\": { \\"scale\\": \\"x\\", \\"band\\": \\"true\\", \\"offset\\": -1 } } } } ] }The A station was closed on 15 March 1976 with a generating capacity of 53 MW. Brighton B Power Station In the early 1940s it became clear that a large power station was going to be needed to provide electricity for the south east area. The Southwick site was selected by the national power board, the Central Electricity Board. In 1946 Brighton Corporation was ordered to proceed with the construction of the new station, consisting of six 52.5 MW generating sets. The first pile was driven on 25 November 1947. During the construction of the station, on 1 April 1948, the electric supply industry in the United Kingdom was nationalised, and the British Electricity Authority took over responsibility of the site from Brighton Corporation. On 26 June 1950 consent was given for the second section of the station, but it was decided that the last two generating sets would have a capacity of 60 MW, and sets 1 to 4 uprated to 55.5 MW. The station's six units were commissioned from December 1952 to September 1958, and the station had a total generating capacity of 342 MW. The chimneys were 350 feet high and were 32 feet internal diameter at the base reducing to 24 feet internal diameter at the top. The demolition of one of its chimneys was featured in a 2009 advert for EDF Energy. By 1961 the station had an installed capacity of 342 MW, comprising 4 √ó 55.5 MW and 2 √ó 60 MW turbo-alternators. The 55.5 MW machines were decommissioned in 1975. The turbines were supplied with steam from 11 pulverised coal boilers each with a capacity of 320,000 lb/hr (40.3 kg/s) giving a total steam output of 3,520,000 lb/hr (443.5 kg/s). The steam conditions at the turbine stop valves were 900 psi (62.1 bar) and 482¬∞C. Seawater was used for condensing and cooling.

She has been described by Bustle as \\"fiction's most famous fashionista\\". Personal life Becky grew up in Oxshott, Surrey with her Mum and Dad. After attending Bristol University, she moved to London. She first lived with her best friend Susan \\"Suze\\" Cleath-Stuart before she eventually moved to New York City. Prior to moving to New York, she worked as a personal finance expert on a breakfast television program called 'Morning Coffee'. Becky met her future husband, Luke Brandon, CEO of Brandon Communications (a Public Relations firm) during a press conference while she was working as a financial journalist for 'Successful Saving' magazine. She helped him pick out luggage for his girlfriend, Sacha. Becky did not know that Luke had a girlfriend and thought that Luke liked her. She had an angry, tearful confrontation with him where she said that she \\"wasn't a joke.\\" She attracted his attention after she published an article about one of his clients. They appear on television together and they began dating at the end of the first book. Luke and Becky marry in America in the Plaza Hotel on June 22, 2002 and also in England at Becky's parents' house on June 23, 2002. Becky and Luke have a daughter named Minnie Brandon who was born on December 3, 2003. In literature Confessions of a Shopaholic In The Secret Dreamworld of a Shopaholic(also known as Confessions of a Shopaholic in the US), Becky works as a financial journalist. Although she has significant debts, such as an overdraft and credit card debt, nothing stops her from purchasing new clothes, shoes and other things which she purchases impulsively. As a result, her flatmate and best friend, Susan Cleath-Stuart (commonly referred to as Suze) has to keep an eye on her spending. On the other hand, Suze knows that Becky does not have enough money to pay her share of the council tax and even tears up a cheque written by Becky. Becky meets PR mogul Luke Brandon of Brandon Communications. While hiding away in Surrey, Becky discovers her kindly neighbor, Martin and Janice, are facing financial trouble due to an absentminded advice she gave them involving Flagstaff Life's takeover. Her boss, Phillip, Alicia and even everyone talked about it, but she hardly been paying attention and being more focused on doing her nails. Feeling guilty for her culpability in making Martin and Janice to miss out on thousands of pounds in a windfall resulting from a bank takeover, Becky sets out to make things right. She writes an article to \\"The Daily World\\" that exposes Flagstaff Life's duplicity in defrauding their customers. The article is a success, and leads to Becky appearing on a daytime television show, The Morning Coffee. Unfortunately, Becky did not know that the bank was a client of Luke Brandon's PR firm. Luke is angry with her, believing she wrote the article just to get back at him for treating her poorly at Harrods. Becky and Luke square off during her appearance on The Morning Coffee. After successfully convincing Luke about Flagstaff Life's defrauding their customers, he concedes that she was right. He announces that Brandon Communications will no longer be representing that bank. At the end of the first book, Becky is offered a regular spot on a hit morning TV show as a financial advice guru and she helps a caller with her financial problems. Becky finally faces Derek Smeath and asks him to help her with her financial problems. She also begins dating Luke and they spend the night at the Ritz Hotel. The setup of the template is explained in this story...how Becky Bloomwood, a clever and creative girl with an addiction to shopping, gets herself in over her head, but when she makes her comeback, she's often able to help family and friends in the process. When push comes to shove, her loved ones are her treasures, which is why Becky Bloomwood is so beloved. Shopaholic Abroad In Shopaholic Abroad (also known as Shopaholic Takes Manhattan in the US) Becky goes to New York City with her then-boyfriend Luke, leaving Alicia in charge of Brandon Communications in London, to Becky's dismay. She shows up in Manhattan to loads of wonderful TV offers...but before she left for the States, she'd visited Brandon Communications and had a sneaking suspicion she left something behind. Overwhelmed by Barney's, Fifth Avenue, and the discovery of sample sales, she goes overboard, even for her. Meanwhile, Luke is dismayed to find out that some of his investors are a little shaky and he's spending all of his time reassuring them. But when they find out that Alicia has not only tried to take over the company, but stolen Becky's bills and sent them to the Daily World, outing her as a Shopaholic to the fans of Morning Coffee, to whom she gives financial advice. She loses her gig on the TV show and all American TV prospects, and Luke's investors back away entirely. After a huge row in Manhattan, during which Becky refers to his beloved birth mother Elinor as a \\"cow of a mother\\", it seems they've lost each other. However, Becky has one trick up her sleeve...and manages not only to save her reputation, but also Luke's when she exposes Alicia and Ben's plans to Michael Ellis (that leads to not only Alicia and her co-conspirators being fired, but they and Ben face embezzlement charges). She also secured a job in New York as a personal shopper at Barneys...even as Luke begs her to take a job with Brandon Communications London. Shopaholic Ties the Knot In Shopaholic Ties The Knot Becky agrees to let her neighbor Danny Kovitz, a fashion designer who currently lives with (read: sponges off) his brother and who has blown every opportunity that's come his way so far, design her bridesmaid dress for Suze's wedding to Tarquin. Worrying that Luke will take this as pressure to marry, she blithely tells him that she's not prepared to get married for ten years. Danny, after stalling and asking such questions as, \\"Do you need the dress TODAY today?\\" whips together a gorgeous dress and secures a promise from Becky that should she marry, he'll design the dress. Luke isn't fooled for a moment by her \\"ten-years\\" plan and puts an engagement ring inside the bouquet that she catches at Suze's wedding; she is only too happy to accept. Meanwhile, Luke is still determined to win the love of his birth mother, Elinor, and is over the moon about her offer to throw them a wedding at the plaza...despite the fact that Becky's mother had thrown herself and all her friends into wedding preparations immediately after their engagement. Becky spends a good portion of the book trying to tell one or the other that her wedding will be in NYC at the Plaza or in Oxshott at her parents‚Äô home, much to Suze's dismay, Becky can't quite seem to make up her mind: do it at the Plaza and please Luke, and also have the wedding of her dreams, or do it in Oxshott with the family she adores. At the same time, Luke is spending too much time with Elinor's charity‚Äîhe's assigned a member of his staff to work with Elinor full- time on her charity, insisting it will be good PR for Brandon Communications, despite his partner Michael's severe reservations. Becky insists he's being taken advantage of, and that Luke is so desperate to impress Elinor, he won't let himself see it. When Becky finds press of Elinor, claiming total credit for all the work her charity has done, she reluctantly shares the information with Luke. She later confronts his mother for her behavior in the way she mistreated Luke all of his life and will not stand by anymore to let him take it. Elinor is offended and calls Becky out for insulting her, believing her to be unworthy of her son's love. She warns Becky if she turns down the wedding at the Plaza, she will have to pay the fine. Becky refuses to back down and bargains with Elinor in exchange that she writes an apology letter to Luke and confess to her wrongdoing. Suze, in the meantime, is insisting Becky pick a location for her wedding...and gets so upset with Becky's indecision‚Äîshe tells Michael and Suze lamely that \\"it'll work itself out\\"‚Äîand Suze is so fed up and anxious she goes into premature labor. Throwing her entire life to the wind, Becky stays with Suze for the first two weeks of her godson Ernie's life plans her dream wedding to Luke Brandon- one in Oxshott, planned by her own parents, and the other in Manhattan, planned by Luke's cold mother, Elinor. After Luke and his mother have a final confrontation, it seems like Becky's miracle has happened. Meanwhile, Becky must assist Laurel, a longtime client of hers who suspects her ex-husband, Bill, has been stealing her family's antique jewelry collection (including an Emerald pendant her grandmother gave her) and been giving it to his much younger girlfriend, Amy Forrester. She goes undercover and confirms this to Laurel. Becky is able to help her get her jewelry back and force both Bill and Amy to apologize for their wrongdoing. Grateful, she offers Becky anything she wants and she comes up with an idea. Coming up with an exquisite plan that only Becky Bloomwood could come up with, she saves the day for everyone. She and Luke pretend to get married at the Plaza hotel and then flies off in Laurel's private jet to Oxshott to really get married at home. In the process, she sets up Michael with a woman he can truly love, and sets off Danny Kovitz's astronomical career as well. Becky also surprises Luke with a 10-month honeymoon trip around the world after cashing in her New York wedding gifts. Shopaholic On Honeymoon Becky and Luke are in Venice. Luke is furious when he discovers that Becky had bought 12 expensive Murano wine glasses and attempted to remind her that they already have 12 expensive glass dishes they bought the other day that they had sent home. She tries to convince him that she just wanted it to match the wine glasses just in case they host a party. Luke reminds Becky that they need to be careful in their spending while on their honeymoon. They head over to an art museum, which Becky is more than pleased to visit due to it not being like the Guggenheim museum. Shopaholic & Sister The novel commences with newly-wed Becky enjoying her 10-month-long honeymoon around the World. When she visits Milan, Italy, Becky shops while Luke meets a new client. After promising her new husband that she will not buy anything, she explores the city with the intention of purchasing a gift for Luke. Becky purchases a new leather belt, wanting to replace the one she ruined when she was waxing her legs with the hot wax. Her resolve wanes when she encounters the chance to purchase an Angel handbag. Unfortunately, Becky cannot purchase it immediately because there is a wait list. Nathan Temple, a customer at the shop, helps jump Becky to the top of the waiting list because he and the owner are friends. She promises to pay him back someday and gives Luke the new belt. He is pleased with the belief Becky has changed and apologizes for his quick judgment. Upon coming home, she discovers to her disappointment that no one was happy to see her and Luke back, but also her parents appear to be hiding something. While she was away, Suze had found herself a new best friend in Lulu whom doesn't really like Becky and the feelings appear quite mutual. After a confrontation with Lulu, Becky feels more isolated from her best friend since the two women have more in common. Luke comforts her and admits that no one was expecting them back for another month. Becky's problems become worse when two truckloads of her souvenirs show up to their loft and the bills are outrageously expensive. At first, Luke appears to be mildly amused by what Becky has purchased from all over the World. Eventually, it becomes obvious that there is not sufficient space for all of Becky's purchases. She promises Luke that she will arrange things properly. As Beck's new job is not scheduled to commence immediately, Luke orders her to sort everything out in her spare time. Taking the advice of her kindly neighbors, Becky uses eBay in order to sell most of the items to make most of the money back to pay Luke back. She also accidentally sells 20 Tiffany clocks (which was meant as a gift for the Arcodas Group). When Luke discovers Becky's mistake from his co-worker who bought the clocks for a cool 20k pounds, he is cross with her careless attitude and they go days without talking to each other. The Bloomwoods come for a visit and are ready to tell Becky the news. They wanted to wait until she settled back home before revealing important news to their daughter. Becky learns that she has an older half-sister named Jessica because her father had a relationship with another woman named Marguerite. Graham explained that they had a relationship before she met another man named Bill Bertram who was an owner of a grocery store in Cumbria and married him. Excited at the prospect of having a sister, Becky thinks that Jessica will be exactly like her, will share a similar passion for shopping and watching films and even helping her cope with Suze no longer being her friend. Becky is disappointed when she initially meets Jess, who is thrifty, environmentally friendly and a bit standoffish. Jess lacks enthusiasm when Becky gives her a gift. After a heated confrontation with her sister, Becky faces marital problems with Luke whom is displeased with the way she's behaving and having found out that she set him up for a meeting with Nathan Temple. While both of them spend a few days fighting with each other, Becky feels insulted when Luke talks highly of Jess in being more helpful than her. She is angry and in tears, Becky tells him off that she's had a lot of her own problems the last few weeks and he never had time for her. Despite showing compassion for her, Luke maintains he needs time away from Becky and hopes while he's away, she can reassess her behavior. After he leaves, Becky reads from a paper which compiles a list of complaints Luke has with her and concludes that her marriage has fallen apart. She tries to call Suze, but she is too busy with Lulu in planning an outing for their children. Next, Becky attempts to call her parents for comfort, only to remember that they're going on a wellness cruise. After a trip to the supermarket fails to distract Becky from her thoughts, she tries to sleep it off in her first night in the loft alone. Soon she has a nightmare about transforming into her nemesis, Alicia, that makes her realize what she has done. Becky heads to Scully in Northern England to reconcile with Jess and learn how to be thrifty. Jess initially refuses to help out after her behavior in London, but Jim offers her a place to stay at his friend's Bed and Breakfast. While in Scully, Becky befriends Jim's teenaged daughter, Kelly, and she becomes a supporting friend similar to Suze. Learning more from Jim about her sister's past under Bill's harsh upbringing, Becky finally realizes that Jess had been originally right about her being a spoiled brat all her life. After failing to talk to Jess, Kelly suggests that she forgets about her and believes they're nothing alike. Becky almost takes her advice, but Jim convinces her to come with his family up to an environmental meeting. At an environmental meeting, she befriends Robin and other protesters and they like her ideas for more media attention. However, Jess is against it and wants Becky to leave. Robin insists that she stays because he and the other protesters feel that she had better ideas and the meeting is no place for personal family issues. While talking to Jess alone, Becky discovers that she recently had a test done for a blood clot from an accident she had years earlier. Becky is shocked by this, but then recalls that she was told to get tested by Jess if they were related, something that she pushed on the back of her mind. Jess admitted that after learning more about her mother's flirtatious past from her aunt, she was really seeking a DNA test between her and Graham before finding more potential fathers. Becky comes to the conclusion that since there was no DNA test done along with everyone else assuming, she and Jess may not be related and is heartbroken by this. Before leaving, Becky apologizes to Jess for her earlier behavior and admits she was right. Her behavior compounded more problems than solutions and her marriage to Luke finally fell apart. Jess forgives Becky and wishes her the best of luck in saving her marriage. Back at her room, Becky ponders what to do as she packs her bags for the return trip home. Without Suze to help her cope and her parents being away, Becky must find a way to save her marriage on her own. Robin and the other protesters beg Becky to stay and help them, but she refuses and tells them she must return home. Jim tries to convince her to stay and sincerely admits he is concerned about her well being and having a mental breakdown while she's alone in London. He believes by helping the protesters out in getting more media coverage, it could distract her from her problems at home. Becky appreciates Jim's concerns, but remains resolute in returning home to save her marriage to Luke. Before leaving, Jim shows Becky, Jess's rock collection and tells her the story about everything. This made her resentment not only disappear, but also made Becky feel guilty for the way she hurt Jess by insulting her passion in rock collecting. She also comes to the realization that shopping for unnecessary items can be boring as well, but has never admitted it until now. Becky follows Jess to the annual hiking to apologize again, finally realizing that Jess is exactly like her and share the same level of passion in spite of their different hobbies. Unfortunately, she is not only wearing the incorrect footwear for such a long hike, but also inappropriately dressed as well. Becky doesn't follow the trail and gets injured. Luckily for her, Jess has the mental and moral fortitude to help her. Becky reconciles with Jess when she admits to how she had seen the beauty of her rock collection and the passion she holds for them. Jess tries to deny it, but Becky admits that she hides the passion better. She admits when it comes to shopping, Becky has a harder time hiding it when it comes to clothes and other unnecessary items. It was also there Jess finally tells Becky that she was only half to blame for the marriage falling apart and also reveals Luke's part of the damage because he was so busy trying to win over his new clients that he ignored her needs. Jess then asks about Suze, which Becky admits she had found a new friend and her other friend, Danny being to busy that she hasn't got any friends. She discredits that claim and admits that Becky has her as a friend and sister. Jess finally agrees to help Becky learn how to be thrifty and loves the silver Tiffany bean necklace she gave her. At the hospital, she manages to reconcile with Luke, who reveals that he was quite angry with her for having set up a meeting with Nathan Temple behind his back and admits she was originally right about Temple. He promises to work out their marriage together. Becky also reconciles with Suze, whom admits while she still likes having Lulu around, she also misses the fun in being best friends with her. At the end, Becky enjoys being thrifty and learns of her pregnancy. Shopaholic & Baby In Shopaholic & Baby Becky is going through the joys of expecting her first child, complete with shopping for baby and a new home. However, there is only one problem, she is going to Dr. Braine, a family obstetrician who has seen previous Brandon women's pregnancies and which Becky doesn't like going to. During a shopping trip to Bambinos, she overhears a conversation between other women about Venetia Carter, a celebrity obstetrician to whom she wants to go. After convincing Luke to see her, Becky discovers why he is uncomfortable with changing obstetricians. Venetia is his ex-girlfriend from his university days, but Becky doesn't think much of it when she reassures them that she's seeing someone else. She suspects that Luke is having an affair Venetia, particularly after Venetia herself tells Becky as much. After she persuades Becky that she and Luke are seeing each other and their relationship was like Penelope and Odysseus. She asks Luke if he's having an affair with Venetia. He denies this and admits the truth to Becky about his ex-girlfriend. Realizing the truth and feeling bad for wanting to change obstetricians, she apologizes to Luke for her behavior. They agree it's in the best interest of their baby to return to Dr. Braine. During that time, Becky still has issues with Suze's best friend, Lulu, and discovers a couple of photos that reveals her for the hypocrite she is from a PI she hired in secret to keep an eye on Luke and Venetia. During her baby shower, Becky shows Suze the photos of Lulu's own problems with her children and she sees her for who she is. However, Suze refuses Becky's request to publish an article exposing Lulu on the British tabloid \\"The Daily World\\" and prefers to keep the photos safe so she can look at them in secret. Becky learns about Arcodas Group's CEO, Iain Walker, whom is making horrible rumors about Brandon C's reputation and threatening to leave. She later receives photos from the same PI of him being in the company with other women, including her current obstetrician. At first he thought he was photographing Luke, but when Becky points Luke out in the background, the PI got angry at his son. The PI's son defends himself by admitting he had actually been following Iain and Venetia for a while because of possible rumors that they're planning something bad for Brandon Communications. Overhearing this, she suspects that Venetia is helping Iain ruin Brandon C's reputation in her latest attempt to get Luke to leave Becky. She shows the photos of Iain and Venetia together to Luke, but refuses to answer him about where she got them from (possibly feeling bad for suspecting Luke of having an affair with Venetia). Near the end, Luke rebukes Venetia for what she did to Becky and tells everyone about her troublesome nature. Back in college, Venetia feign a pregnancy in her attempt to keep them in a relationship together. Though he was relieved that she wasn't pregnant, Luke was still infuriated with Venetia's behavior and ended their relationship. In a last ditch effort, she tries to convince Luke to leave Becky, calling her a \\"dim-witted little airhead\\" who doesn't deserve him. Furious with the insult, he refuses and tells Venetia off that he loves his wife and there's nothing she can do to change that. Luke states that Becky may shop at times, but he sees her as a caring and intuitive person, whereas he sees Venetia as a lying and manipulative person. In that moment, Becky informs Luke they lost out on the house they were planning to buy and are effectively homeless. Suze offers them her family's unused summer home in Scotland, but the Bloomwoods insist that Luke and Becky stay in their home in Surrey. In the midst of the arguing and being homeless, Becky's water breaks and she goes into labor. Her furious mother, Jane, rebukes Venetia for her mistreatment towards her daughter and orders her out of their lives. Once she's gone, Suze reveals her plans to tell \\"The Daily World\\" about Venetia in the hopes of helping her friends and other pregnant women avoid getting her. During that time, a family member calls Dr. Braine in to assist Paula with Becky's labor. Through her professional and personal woes, Becky happily ends the book a new mum to daughter Minnie. Luke and Becky temporarily move in with her parents after losing out on the home they hoped to buy, while Luke works to save his company. Mini Shopaholic In Mini Shopaholic, Minnie is now 2 years old. There is a major financial crisis, and after Minnie's christening is a bust, Becky decides to throw a surprise party for Luke's birthday. However, many doubt she can keep the party a secret. Meanwhile, Jess and Tom get married in secret in Chile and Janice is trying to get them to have children. Minnie is going off the rails, and their fifth proposed house purchase has fallen through and, as it turns out, Jane is anxious for them to leave, so she can have her house back. Luke and Becky agree that Luke won't buy a new car and, seeing his willingness to sacrifice, Becky agrees to wear every single item in her wardrobe three times before shopping for anything new. Meanwhile, Becky is also trying to persuade Luke to have another baby, but he refuses because of Minnie's increasingly bad behavior. Any old reason is good enough for Becky to want another child; she sees some pom-pom hats and wants them to be known as the children in the pom-pom hats, much as she herself wanted to be known as The Girl in the Denny and George Scarf, or The Girl With the Angel Bag. Becky also faces estrangement from her own parents after an argument she has with them. One such argument involve a disagreement that she had with Graham and Jane while discussing Minnie's behaviour. They both suspect that Becky is being selfish in not accepting responsibility for her own actions that lead to Minnie's bad behavior, that of which she denies. Graham and Jane also thinks she's interfering with their lives by inviting herself when they want privacy with each other. After being fed up with Becky's irresponsibility and inability to deal with her problems, she, Graham and Jane have their first serious row and goes weeks without speaking to each other, even when Jess has to battle Janice for trying to give Tom libido induced teas and other methods to make them have a child. Becky still has issues with Elinor whom wants to see Minnie, but soon she recognizes some similarities between them. She tries to warn Luke that they are behaving similar to his mother in keeping her away from Minnie. He staunchly denies it, admitting that he is furious with Elinor about a comment she made about Annabel before her death and the terrible mistreatment that she gave Becky over the years. She eventually reconciles with Elinor after she insists on helping out with the party, which by now is in shambles. Elinor also finally accepts responsibility for her actions in selfishly abandoning Luke, and in a moment of extreme vulnerability, refers to Annabel as \\"his real mother\\". Becky asks Elinor for help in assessing Minnie's bad behavior and she agrees. Still worried about Minnie's wild behavior, Luke (without consulting Becky) hires Nanny Sue, a nanny with her own TV show, who goes into people's homes and they wind up \\"sobbing on her shoulder and asking, 'Nanny Sue, how can we be better people?'\\" When Becky comes home and finds out what he did, she is infuriated with Luke because he didn't consult with her first about it. She admits that she had been talking to Elinor about similar problems with Minnie. This angers Luke for he didn't want his mother to have anything to do with them after what she did in insulting both Becky and Annabel. Before a fight could break out, Nanny Sue calls them to their senses and makes a surprise assessment. She identifies both Luke's fears with having a second child and his issues with his mother, Elinor. Nanny Sue admits that she secretly went undercover to observe the family's behavior at a mall they went to, even before she was called in to assess Minnie's behavior. Becky and Luke are both shocked by this confession since they didn't know that she had gone undercover beforehand. Luke is relieved when Nanny Sue tells him that she knew he had nothing to do with it because he tried hard not to spoil his daughter. She also admits she must confront Becky as a favor to Graham and Jane, revealing they're the ones who called her. She is nervous when Nanny Sue admitted that she had observed Becky's own behavior in a toy store and suspected she was responsible for Minnie's bad behavior. Her buying designer made clothing, fighting with Minnie for an expensive toy pony that she wanted so bad and her refusal to let go of it, proved Nanny Sue's point. Becky defended herself by admitting she had originally refused to buy it for Minnie and angrily tried to remind her about financial trouble she and Luke are both in. While Nanny Sue agreed, she mentions it didn't excuse for the fact that when she caved in, it further supported her suspicion. She makes Becky see that in her spoiling Minnie too much: she played a serious role in her bad behavior. Nanny Sue is the first person to ask Becky if she's considered the possibility she might have a shopping addiction. Becky tries to deny it, claiming she doesn't have an addiction much to Nanny Sue's amusement. However, Minnie's piped up comments of items do nothing to dissuade anyone of that notion and further humiliates her. Feeling betrayed by her own daughter, Becky finally admits that she does and had a hard time learning when to stop. She also realizes her own inability to take responsibility for her actions is what lead to her relationship with her parents being strained and how her spoiling contributed to Minnie's bad behavior are the real reasons why they've had been banned from previous Christmas Grottos. Ironically, Becky realizes the woman she had been talking to at the mall was Nanny Sue with children of her own and how it was similar to what Elinor and even her own parents had told her that all Minnie really needs is discipline. After she agrees to go to \\"Shopaholics Boot Camp\\" and seek help, Becky and Luke can move forward with the idea of expanding their family...if only they can survive the \\"surprise\\" party, which over two million people in London have found out about, which Becky did try to keep a secret. Now reformed, Becky visits Surrey to apologize to Graham and Jane for her earlier behavior. She realized they were originally right in their assessment, but was in denial because of wanting to give Luke a surprise birthday party. In finally accepting responsibility for herself, Becky reconciles with her parents. Having enough of Janice's behavior, Becky defends Jess and Tom's decision to adopt their first child by telling her off to leave them alone. She is fed up Janice's actions in trying to force them to have a natural child first and that she should support their decision. The latter is offended with Becky for calling her out by demanding her to support her decision to want a natural child first. However, she refuses to back down and stands firm with Janice, bargaining with her to ease up if she allows Jess and Tom to adopt first before having a natural child. At the end of the book, Becky has become aware that Luke is doing business for Sage Seymour (a Julia Roberts-type movie star) and that he wants to take the whole family to Hollywood for three months. Shopaholic To The Stars Becky is in LA still hoping to get a job as a personal dresser for Sage Seymour. However, Luke is adamant in not introducing the two because they only there for a few months before returning to England. He wants her to instead focus on getting Minnie into preschool (which she presumably succeeds) and continue going to her support group at a wellness center for her shopping addiction. Becky eventually gets a job as personal dresser to Sage's rival, Lois Kellerton, upon reading of her credentials as a personal shopper from Barneys New York. Although it seems like a dream come true, she soon discovers the job is not what she thought of originally. Especially when Lois starts making crude comments about both Luke and Sage in her own attempt to ruin them. She encourages Becky to get plastic surgery to change her appearance. She starts to act selfish like Lois and tries to keep the job to herself, neglecting her family in the process. Luke eventually finds out and tells Becky what he thinks. This leads to a fight between them and she once again accuses him for trying to ruin her chances to be a personal dresser to Sage. Luke angrily reminds Becky that she never told him that she got a job as a personal dresser to Lois. She must decide where her loyalties stand with: her client, Lois or her family. Still pondering this, she gets an unusual help from her nemesis, Alicia, whom is feeling guilty for her actions against Luke and Becky. She admits that she is trying to reform after seeing her daughter, Ora, befriend Minnie at preschool. Alicia reveals she secretly helped them get Minnie into one of Hollywood's prestige preschools. She suggests that Becky reconsiders getting plastic surgery while she still can, especially when she shows the scars her previous plastic surgeries that went wrong. Becky keeps her encounter with Alicia a secret from Suze whom is still on edge with her and Luke who is still angry with her for her earlier behavior in trying to ruin his company. Becky also discovers Tarquin has joined a wellness center like her, but Suze is convinced they are frauds in brainwashing him into joining a cult. Investigating this and finally convinced that her family and friends come first, Becky confirms Suze's suspicion the whole time. She warns Tarquin to leave the center and his new friends knowing they have care of their own interest over his. Tarquin doesn't believe Becky, but later regrets it. Whether he takes her warning seriously or not is left unclear. Becky decides not to go through with plastic surgery and gives Lois an ultimatum: accept her as herself or she'll quit. The story ends with a cliffhanger, but Becky promises to return soon. Shopaholic To The Rescue Becky returns with one thing on her mind, get her father, Graham, back to her mother. With Luke, Tarquin and Suze in tow, she must look for clues in how he disappeared in sight. Alicia comes to assist them, but Luke and Suze are still convinced that she's up to no good, given their history. Becky must deal with countless phone calls from her hysterical mother and Janice in England as she goes cross- country to rescue her father.

Early career Inspired by his father John Phantasm (and consequently the music he heard playing at home when he was young), Ford started producing his own music in the studio from the age of 9 but did not begin DJing worldwide until he was 13. Wrapped up in the life of DJing, Ford did not return to the studio until he was 15, which was when he 'wanted to get back into the producing part of it since the music was getting more technical'. Not until then did he start producing under the name of Eskimo. The name was chosen because it bears no connection 'to the product'. At age 17 he released his first album Can You Pick Me Up. Eskimo's music began to show up in the sets of psytrance DJs across the globe. By the time he performed his first live set, his repertoire had trebled. His many remixes from this time - some still unreleased due to copyright wrangles - included Infected Mushroom and Skazi, but it was his unofficial remix of The Prodigy \\"Voodoo People\\" that was most popular. In summer 2004, Eskimo released his second artist album \\"Take A Look Out There\\" which included the well-known \\"Party Pooper\\", a track sampling the police shutting down a free party. November 2005 saw the release of Balloonatic Part One. Balloonatic Part Two followed in September 2006. From 2011 to 2015, Ford was a member of electronic music duo Lets Be Friends, which such singles as \\"Manslaughter\\" and \\"FTW\\". The duo has been inactive since his transition to performing as Joyryde. Joyryde Since 2015, Ford has produced bass-heavy house music, solo, under the name Joyryde. He has released all free downloads so far, such as \\"Flo\\" and \\"Speed Trap\\". In 2016, Joyryde signed onto OWSLA, releasing singles \\"Hot Drum\\" and \\"Damn\\" on the record label in 2016 and releasing \\"I Ware House\\" and \\"New Breed\\" on the label in 2017.

It was also aimed against Friedrich Rittelmeyer and the Christengemeinschaft (Christian Community). In it, he demanded that the German Volk be released from Christianity and called Christian teachings of sin and grace as \\"teachings of inferiority\\".

In a mechanical watch, it indicates that the delicate pivots that hold the balance wheel are mounted in a spring suspension system intended to protect them from damage if the watch is dropped. One of the earliest and most widely used was the Incabloc system, invented in 1934. Before the widespread adoption of shock-resistant balance pivots in the 1950s, broken balance wheel staffs were a common cause of watch repairs. Usage Virtually all mechanical watches produced today are shock resistant. Even divers' watches (according to ISO 6425) must correspond not only with such criteria as water resistance, luminosity, magnetic resistance and strap solidity, but also shock resistance. ISO 1413 shock-resistant standard The International Organization for Standardization issued a standard for shock-resistant watches, which many countries have adopted. ISO 1413 Horology‚ÄîShock-resistant watches specifies the minimum requirements and describes the corresponding method of test. It is intended to allow homologation tests rather than the individual control of all watches of a production batch. It is based on the simulation of the shock received by a watch on falling accidentally from a height of 1 m on to a horizontal hardwood surface. In practice shock resistance is generally tested by applying two shocks (one on the 9 o'clock side, and one to the crystal and perpendicular to the face). The shock is usually delivered by a hard plastic hammer mounted as a pendulum, so as to deliver a measured amount of energy, specifically, a 3 kg hammer with an impact velocity of 4.43 m/s (This will deliver approximately 30 Joules of energy to the watch). The watch must keep its accuracy to +/- 60 seconds/day as measured before the test.

He was a well-known spiritual representative of the Romanian Orthodox Church. Biography Cleopa Ilie (lay name: Constantin) was born in Suli»õa, Boto»ôani to a family of peasants. He was the fifth of ten children born to Alexandru Ilie. He attended the primary school in his village. Afterwards he was an apprentice for three years to the monk Paisie Olaru, who lived in seclusion at the Cozancea hermitage. Together with his elder brother, Vasile, Ilie joined the community at Sihastria hermitage in December 1929. In 1935, he joined the army in the town of Boto»ôani, but returned a year later to the hermitage, where he was anointed a monk on 2 August 1937, taking the name \\"Cleopa\\" (i.e. \\"guide\\") at his baptism. In June 1942, he was appointed to hegumen deputy because of abbot Ioanichie Moroi's poor health. On 27 December 1944, he was ordained a hierodeacon (deacon-monk) and on 23 January 1945 a hieromonk (priest-monk) by the archbishop Galaction Cordun, abbot of the Neam≈£ Monastery at the time. Afterwards he was officially appointed hegumen of the Sihastria Hermitage. In 1947, the hermitage became a monastery and vice-archimandrite Cleopa Ilie became archimandrite on approval of Patriarch Nicodim. Because the Communist secret service was looking for him in 1948, he disappeared into the woods surrounding the monastery, staying there for six months. On 30 August 1949, he was appointed abbot of the Slatina Monastery in Suceava county, where he joined 30 other monks from the Sihastria Monastery community as a result of Patriarch Justinian's decision. There he founded a community of monks with over 80 people. Between 1952 and 1954 he was being chased again by the Securitate and, together with hieromonk Arsenie Papacioc, escaped to the Stanisoara Mountains. He was brought back to the monastery after two years upon Patriarch Justinian's order. In 1956 he returned to Sihastria monastery, where he had been anointed, and in the spring of 1959 he retired for the third time to the Neam»õ Mountains, spending the next five years there. He returned to Sihastria in the fall of 1964, as confessor for the entire community and continued to give spiritual advice to both monks and lay people for the next 34 years. Grave at SihƒÉstria Monastery He died on 2 December 1998 at SihƒÉstria Monastery. Reputation He was a strong defender of the traditional Orthodox lifestyle and had a strong influence over later developments in the Romanian Orthodox church. The current patriarch, Daniel, was one of his disciples along with other current bishops. He would always portray himself as a worthless person and consistently diminished his deeds and suffering during his life. He claimed that while in seclusion in the mountains he lived as a king even though the conditions were extremely severe, food was scarce and shelter was improvised. His views on the importance of ecology and the responsibility of man to love and uphold the natural world as the creation of God went a long way ensuring the involvement of the Romanian Church in embracing ecologist views. He was often sought after for advice by various important persons such as politicians and businessman which he received together with common folk. He preached meekness and thorough understanding of the Bible and Holy tradition. It is through his meekness despite his vast power of influencing the church, as well as his vast knowledge, that made from him an emblem of the church revival after the 1989 Revolution.

His name is sometimes spelled \\"Carl Eduard Marius Levy\\" or, in foreign literature, \\"Karl Edouard Marius Levy\\". Levy graduated 1831 from Copenhagen University in Medicine and surgery. Received the university gold medal in 1830. Licentiat (PhD) degree in 1832. Doctorate degree in 1833. He then embarked on a three-year scientific journey which took him to France, Italy and England. Professor extraordinarius in obstetrics in 1841, professor ordinarius in 1850. He founded the monthly medical journal: Hospitals- Meddelelser.Obituary p125 He also founded the Doctor's Association Den Almindelige Danske L√¶geforening in 1857, which he headed until 1859. He suffered and would die from a heart defect. He was born JewishBiography p255. Translated from: \\"mosaiske Trosbekjendelse\\" but converted to ChristianityBiography p256 in 1840-1841 in order to pursue an academic career. According to his biography, rampant epidemics of childbed fever at the Copenhagen maternity institution tested his ingenuity and determination. Repeated closures of the institution and the creation of interim locales proved fruitless. After a study tour to England and Ireland in 1846 he completely rebuilt and reformed the maternity institution, however with unsatisfactory results.Translated from the biography p 257 (in Danish): \\"Barselfeberens fortsatte voldsomme H√¶rgen i F√∏dselsstiftelsen uafbrudt maatte holde ham i Aande og s√¶tte hans Opfindsomhed og Handlekraft paa Pr√∏ve. Gjentagen Lukning af F√∏dselsstiftelsen og Oprettelsen af interimistiske Hj√¶lpelokaler viste sig frugtesl√∏se, og efter at han ved en Rejse til England og Irland i 1846 havde gjort sig bekjendt med de derv√¶rende vel ansete F√∏dselsstiftelsers Indretning, skred man da under hans Ledelse til en fuldst√¶ndig Ombygning og Reorganisation af vor F√∏dselsstiftelse, men ogsaa kun med utilfredsstillende Resultat. \\" Professor Carl Braun in Vienna said about the Copenhagen hospital, that \\"because this is the most appropriate and noteworthy newly constructed maternity hospital, in which every step has been taken to halt puerperal fever epidemics, we allow ourselves to estimate that in this new building under Levy's direction no puerperal fever epidemics will occur.\\"Semmelweis (1861):187 Professor Levy was an outspoken critic of Ignaz Semmelweis' ideas, that childbed fever was an iatrogenic disease. Semmelweis theorized that decaying matter on the hands of doctors, who had recently conducted autopsies, was brought into contact with the genitials of birthgiving women during the medical examinations at the maternity clinic. Semmelweis proposed a radical hand washing theory using chlorinated lime, now a known disinfectant, and demonstrated dramatic reductions in mortality rates. In a rather infamous concluding remark, . A translation was published in Germany by Gustav Adolf Michaelis in 1850, ( Semmelweis (1861):137, translator Carter's footnote 18 p 137. Professor Levy writes: > These are my impressions of Dr. Semmelweis's experiences; for these reasons > I must judge provisionally that his opinions are not clear enough and his > findings not exact enough to qualify as scientifically founded.Semmelweis > (1861):186 (translated by Carter, possibly from a German translation) The above translation is rather benign compared to the punch in the original Danish quote.the original quote is (in Danish):\\".. at, s√• vidt de endnu foreligge, hans Anskuelser synes for uklare, hans Iagttagelser for flygtige, hans Erfaringer for usikre, til deraf at udlede videnskabelige Resultater.\\", which would translate into: \\".. that insofar as they are laid out [*] his [Semmelweis'] views appears too unclear, his observations too volatile, his experiences too uncertain, to deduce scientific results therefrom.\\" The sentence before *) could perhaps be translated to the meaning \\"I must judge provisionally (that) ..\\" The original text is available (in Danish) as a scanned document as well as in plain text. For more of his criticism, see Semmelweis' ideas rejected as unscientific.

During the Nazi era, he was part of the Confessing Church, and in the 1960s took part in the debate around the demands of Rudolf Bultmann to 'de-mythologize' the New Testament as an advocate of a word-oriented interpretation of the Bible. The Walter K√ºnneth Prize is named after him. Life  Youth and Training  Walter K√ºnneth was the fourth child of minister Lorenz K√ºnneth and his wife, Setta (born Setta Schlupper). Young K√ºnneth grew up in the second ministry location of his father, at Hersbruck. His mother died shortly after his birth, due to an illness connected with the birth. After attending the humanities Gymnasium in Erlangen (where he was especially shaped by the neo-Lutheran theology of Phillip Bachmann and the faculty), young K√ºnneth studied evangelical Theology in both Erlangen and T√ºbingen, from Fall 1920 until 1924, with the last two at T√ºbingen influenced by Karl Heim and Adolf Schlatter. He attained a doctorate under Friedrich Brunstad in Philosophie in 1924, with a work on Richard Rothe's Idea of God. He also joined the Christian student-organization known as Wingolf. Vocational Developments During his time in Practical Seminary and a curacy in Munich (which lasted until 1926), he was ordained (2/15/25) and met his wife Mathilde, born Mathilde Ammon. In 1926, K√ºnneth was chosen as a lecturer (Dozent) for the Apologetischen Centrale at the evangelical Johannesstift Berlin-Spandau, a department of the central committee for internal missions, where his student colleagues from Wingolf, Helmut Schreiner and Carl Gunther Schweitzer, already were employed. The concern in apologetics there was both the current Weltanschauung and religious situation of the Weimar Republic and the emerging Third Reich. Through a collection of materials that were marketed, published, and renumerated, the \\"New Apologetic\\" would give a reckoning for Christian Faith in speech with the modern World : in short, the first evangelical Work Academy was established. In 1927, K√ºnneth left Berlin for Anbach to sit for a second theological exam, and he attained his Lizentiaten with a work over Kierkegaard's \\"S√ºndenbegriff\\". After his official Habilitation in Berlin in 1930, he held private lectures in Theology and Apologetics. By 1932, he had become the leader of the Apologetischen Centrale. K√ºnneth noted, after a search for an angle of Biblical proof, that the Resurrection did not have an adept monographical work. And so came about the often-reprinted Theology of the Resurrection (1933). With Helmut Schreiner, he also published \\"The Nation of God\\", which specifically aimed with missionary intent at their own citizens in Germany. Due to the founding of the Deutsche Kirchen in the course of the year 1933, especially the meeting at the Berlin Sports Palace, the book addressed the themes posed by National Socialism: F√ºhrer-headship, obedience-principle, Jewdom, and the Race Question. After the events of '37, the Centrale was closed and K√ºnneth's work was forbidden, K√ºnneth was also banned from either publishing or teaching throughout the entire Reich. In the following year, however, Hans Meiser gave him a ministerial position at Starnberg. In 1944, he was made the deacon of Erlangen. In '46, he became Honorary Professor of Theology in Erlangen. In '53, he assumed Werner Elerts' chair. In his extensive work after this point, he analyzed the matter of State-ethics in The Great Waste (1947) and Politics between God and the Devil (1954). Engagement with Church Politics Along with the pastor of Dahlemer, Martin Niem√∂ller, and the (at that time) General Secretary of the DCSV (Deutschen Christlichen Studentenvereinigung) Hanns Lilje, K√ºnneth had founded in May 1933 the Young Reformation Movement (Jungreformatorische Bewegung), which opposed the co-opting of the Lutheran Evangelical Church by the Nazi state. K√ºnneth belonged to the \\"Confessing Church\\" and also participated in an illegal Church Test-Commission in Berlin-Spandau, under president Hienrich Albertz. In the spring of '35, he circulated a 200-page reply to the standard work on Nazi race theory, Alfred Rosenberg's Mythus des 20 Jahrhunderts. It was entitled : A Reply to the Myth - The Difference between the Nordic Myth and the Biblical Christ. In this writing, he criticized the anti-Christian ideology of Rosenberg, although he shared some of the same concepts, such as \\"minderwertigen\\", \\"zersetzenden\\", and \\"Weltjudentum\\". Based on its large success (36000 copies in three months) the Gestapo replied by questioning him, closing the Apologetischen Centrale, and banning his works. His works were banned across the entire Reichsgebiet, and his venia legendi to train others was revoked. He published another work which spoke of the betrayal of Luther in connection with Rosenberg, but this was also seized and destroyed. He was appointed to the vicarite of Starnberg in January 1938 by bishop Hans Meiser of Bavaria, and in 1944, accepted a call back to Erlangen. After the war's end, Paul Althaus made him an honorary member of the Faculty there in 1945, and in 1946, he was a member of the Bavarian Land-Synod. K√ºnneth turned down calls to Mainz, Munser and Kiel, but in 1953 took over the teaching chair of Werner Elerts. Unfavorably for his memory, K√ºnneth had during the early Reich period spoken of (limited) cooperation with the Gestapo in the matter of information sharing concerning religious minorities like Jehovah's Witnesses. During the 1960s, K√ºnneth endorsed the death penalty from a theological conviction that opposing it was a sign of moral weakness and national apostasy. Later life In 1961, Mathilde died, the mother of his three children: Irmela, Adolf, and Freidrich-Wilhelm. Three years later, he married Gerda Bwtz from lauban. In 1962, and in 1966, he was awarded medals of honor for service in Bavaria. In 1962, Wartburg Theological Seminary made him an honorary member of faculty. K√ºnneth interpreted Bultmann's challenge to mythologized Christianity as a second Confessional fight, and became the leading member of the group of \\"No Other Gospel\\", along with Peter Beyerhaus, Paul Deitenbeck, Rudolf Baumer, Gerhard Bergmann, and Wilhelm Busch. In March 1966, he founded with Baumer the \\"D√ºsseldorf Declaration\\". In the 1960s, he participated in lectures, panel discussions, and other public offerings and debates with thinkers like Gerhard Ebeling, Joachim Kahl, Heinz Zahrndt, Dorothee Solle, Jorg Zink, Ernst Kasemann, Gunther Klein, and Ernst Fuchs; as an ecclesiastical office holder and confessional Christian, he was an anomaly. In 1981, he received the Order of Maximillian for Art and Knowledge. He died 26 October 1997, and a large crowd attended his funeral and burial at the churchyard of Neustadter. Argumentation with Rudolf Bultmann In the 50s and 60s, K√ºnneth had engaged himself to undertake the struggle against Rudolph Bultmann's demand to \\"de-mythologize\\" the New Testament. In the very center of the controversy stands the Resurrection of Jesus, just as the matter of his person and work (Christology). K√ºnneth attempted to answer Bultmann's contention that the essence of the Gospel was the kernel of mythical truth embedded in the three-tiered, mythical Universe without failing to acknowledge Bultmann's insights. He did agree with Bultmann that > If the resurrection is an event on the plane of history, then it also > participates in all that determines the nature of history. The resurrection > event is then a relative fact in the context of the phenomena and life of > history, stands in continuity with a multitude of other known and unknown > factors belonging to this world, is an element in historical existence and > as such possesses no absolute validity but is subject to conditions and thus > to the uncertainties and probabilities of all history. To insist upon the > historic character of the resurrection has the result of objectifying it, > ... that means... that the assertion of its historicality leads to an > irresistible process of dissolution, which ominously threatens the reality > of the resurrection itself. ( K√ºnneth, The Theology of the Resurrection (St. > Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1965), pp. 24‚Äì25.) His difference with Bultmann can be described: > It is important now to notice the strategic point of difference between > K√ºnneth and Bultmann : K√ºnneth is able to avoid objectifying apologetics and > rationalizations without demythologizing. He is able to achieve much the > same end by adopting something' like Barth's insistence that though the > event of the resurrection truly occurred in our world, it \\"transcends\\" > historical causality and thus is (fortunately or unfortunately) undetectable > by the historian's methods. (from Robert M. Price, \\"Risen Indeed?\\") K√ºnneth believed that although Bultmann was correct that empirical evidence could never decide the matter of the Resurrection (an event which was the Ur- Wunder of God, the prime miracle), and that Bultmann was also correct that saying so would destroy the transcendent content of the Ur-Wunder, still Bultmann had destroyed the Gospel by implying that Christ's victory over our time world of death and sin was a purely mythical one, with no implications for sinful creatures trapped in an immanent world. Theologie der Auferstehung (Theology of the Resurrection ‚Äì 1933) [All footnotes are from the Concordia edition of 1965, St. Louis]. K√ºnneth begins by noting that \\"the bankruptcy of a secularized theology in the face of the resurrection is (of course) largely due to Schleiermacher\\", who maintained that the spiritual presence of Jesus and his influence on the disciples he left behind was not contingent on any news of the facts of Christ's resurrection (p. 16). Ritschl added to the confusion by approaching from the other direction: the qualities of the exalted Christ are already contained in his existence in time. K√ºnneth sees this as enormously over-simplistic, and notes wryly, of those who conclude that Christ's resurrection was largely a \\"vision\\" of the fervent would-be apostles, that Jesus himself taught that visions from beyond the grave would not alter the religious experience of men (the parable of Lazarus and Dives, Luke 16:29ff). K√ºnneth argues that \\"the resurrection of Jesus cannot be cut out of\\" the Christian kerygma/message (p. 36) [either to dispose of it or to explain it]: for that would leave us merely with matters for psychic or sociological investigation, however inadequate, scientifically, these explanations would be to account for the duration, intensity, and persistence of the Christian faith (and here, one cannot help but think of William James's Varieties of Religious Experience). To imagine Dogma to be what Matthew Arnold took it to be, the Aberglaube, or added Belief above and beyond the Facts, would be to imprison Christianity forever within the continuum of space and time, which for K√ºnneth, is subject to uncertainty and mortality and subjectivity. This, in fact, is just what Adolf Harnack had done in Germany, as Arnold was writing in England : Dogma was interpreted, via Higher Criticism, to be a Greek addition to the pure New Testament. K√ºnneth's reply to Harnack's cultured successors is to explain Aberglaube neither in pietistic terms of a natural Jesus, nor in Bultmann's existential manner of essential myth. His apologetic for the Resurrection, then, is dogmatic and historical at once : he appeals to the Jewish materialistic understanding of the totality of death in judgement, as well as the philosophical inadequacy of ethic-moral explanations that presume upon the immortality of the soul. K√ºnneth absolutely accepted an empty tomb, but he thought that most modern problems with the Resurrection began as dogmatic misconceptions. K√ºnneth would have accepted few of the modern Church's efforts to defend the Resurrection, whether in Van Til's presuppositions, retreatist Pietism that avoids debating the central fact of the religion, or liberal accommodations to the spirit of free inquiry. He might even have disagreed with Alvin Plantinga's formulation of the Resurrection as something that is \\"plausible might have happened\\". K√ºnneth seemed to have believed that Time itself was without any meaning unless it had, as its absolute reference point, the unleashing of the exalted Christ out of the tomb. The liberal retreat into the immanent plenum of sensory experience (with its related Christology of Christ as purely an outstanding \\"servant of God\\"), was as unacceptable as Bultmann's accidental denigration of transcendent Truth into something purely mythical (totally ahistorical). Theologie der Auferstehung was his manifesto on the subject, and he updated it many years later, with a chapter on eschatology and the aeon of aeons, as well as more arguments aimed at Bultmann. He also included a new, need discussion on the nature of Time (something Augustine had noted as problematic long ago), in which (predictably) he rejected the dichotomy between eternity and earthly time: \\"This positing of an exclusive antithesis between time and eternity makes impossible any union of the eternal God with temporal man\\" (p. 182). Theologie der Auferstehung is tightly argued, copiously footnoted, and conceived with vision : it is no accident that he shares an affinity with Eastern theology on this point (regardless of their emphasis on the Incarnation), noting that the Evangelical Churches in Russia have \\"a profound grasp of the Easter Act of Jesus Christ\\" (p. 19). Moltmann may have emphasized the cross, and the Catholic Church the Incarnation, but it is true to assert that for K√ºnneth, the Resurrection is the Archimedean point of eschatology, the meaning of time, history, miracles, dogma, and all else beside. Anything else, he believes, undercuts the early Christian emphasis on Jesus as the risen Kyrios (Lord), who is \\"risen indeed!\\". This reprinted \\"monograph\\" on the Resurrection was also a reaction to Paul Althaus' doctrines, which he partly agreed with, but who had criticized the original edition, and to whom K√ºnneth respectfully responded. Arguing from (for him) the reliable witness of Scripture, dogmatically defended, the decisive question for K√ºnneth becomes whether or not the Resurrection appearances of the Risen One were basically of the same nature as the prophetic visions of the Spirit in the Old Testament, which he defined as \\"an emerging reality which lays hold of man, and is accompanied at the same time by adutions which communicate new knowledge.\\" (p. 82) This was Rudolph Otto's view, he notes, in Aufsatze, das Numinose betreffend. In the place of Yahweh, walking and eating, appears the risen Lord, bearing in his veiled garb, \\"the marks of the Pilgrim God\\" (citing E. Fascher, Deus Invisibilis, 1931). K√ºnneth argues for a formal similarity between Old Testament theophany and New Testament opthe. However, noting that the early Church did not place the visions of martyrs on a par with the appearances to the disciples, and insisting that the Resurrection is sui generis among the miracles of God, he cites his old teacher Schlatter: > If the disciples had considered their faith in Jesus to be the product of > movements within their own souls, then instead of the Church there would > have been a body of mystics busy creating in themselves the ecstatic state > by means of which the Christ becomes visible also to them. Geschichte des > Christus, 520/523 Building his case he continues: \\"The Risen One is neither a fantasy, nor a theophany, but the appearance of a new, living mode of existence. The appearance expresses the connection between life beyond death and life within history...the Risen One is in fact precisely not God himself in some sort of disguise, but Jesus of Nazareth, raised and exalted by God.\\" (p. 85). Neither are the appearances repeatable, as prophetic visions were. Nor could the receiver of the vision carry out the task, but fail to communicate the content of the vision, as in the Old Testament. Nor was the form of the vision, and its content, a matter of indifference, so long as the prophetic task was communicated. K√ºnneth argues that this was the reason the Church attached importance enough to the receivers of the appearances to make them eligible to be Apostles, especially proven in the case of Saint Paul. An Apostle had to have eaten and broken bread with the Risen One, or in Paul's case, been confronted on the road to Damascus, an ophthe seondarily attested by supporting visions to other Christians (as requiring a second witness, being an exception that proved the rule). These revelations were not full, however. Though unique, they were proportioned on the scale the revealing made necessary (p. 87). The reality of the Resurrection is one thing, and its appearance to something else, just as the disciples still await the full, unmediated revelation. This was the paradox and the tension of the primitive Christian experience, which created the nature of the Ekklesia, such as it was and is. \\"The Risen One reveals in the appearances his glorified existence\\" (p. 87). Central to this is corporeality, of a kind which prohibits both spiritualizing and materializing. K√ºnneth rejects the classic Lutheran commentator Quenstadt's definition of Christ's new body: \\"reproductio sive reparatio of precisely the same body as was destroyed by death, ex atomis sue particulis illius corporis hinc inde disiectis atque dissipatis\\"(p. 88), just as he rejects Bultmann's mythical Christ. The appearances point to a soma tes doxes (Phil. 3:21) and soma pneumatikon (I Cor. 15:42), developed by Paul. The apostleship does not hinge upon Jesus' calling of the disciples while alive, but upon Christ's appearances to the disciples, among whom James and Peter were chosen first of all, a significance the early Church did not miss. \\"Paul sees the diakonis (Acts 20:24) and the apostole to world mission (Rom.1:5/Gal1:1) as received directly from the Christ who has risen and appeared to him. Accordingly he knows himself to be an ambassador, a leitourgos, a doulos of the Lord (Rom15:16/Gal1:10, p.90). The Ascension itself is the last, specially significant appearance of \\"the Risen One\\", and not a parallel miracle to the Resurrection. Even the empty tomb is subordinated to the Resurrection: that the tomb was empty was part of the Gospel, entailed by the appearance corporeal of the glorified body of the Risen One. The inverse of this would not have been necessarily true, and so the empty tomb is implied, but not emphasized: an empty tomb alone could have indicated many various things. Emil Brunner's note that Paul does not mention the empty tomb does not entail a conflict between Paul's Gospel and the original apostles (p. 92). Again, K√ºnneth defends the extreme middle : the Church becomes increasingly focused on an empty tomb (as the original witnesses die off), yes, but \\"the decisive question remains open, how far an essential concern of the primitive Christian Church is expressed precisely in this tendency\\". Therefore, \\"according to the church tradition about the resurrection event handed down by Paul in I Cor 15:1ff, a difference between the experience of Paul and of the original apostles seems impossible\\". K√ºnneth understood that the dogmatic theologian, \\"of all people\\", had to be willing to make his views on the Resurrection event precisely and definitively known (p95). For him, the empty tomb was a sign, interpreted by the ophthe to the apostles. The empty tomb expresses Resurrection's \\"face towards history\\" (p97), proof that its power touches the vale of tears of matter undergoing history. Yet, God's power is not bound to or by the substratum of Creation. The Resurrection touches history, and lives within it, but is not conditioned by it. In this, he concurs with Bultmann, although he disagrees with Emil Brunner that one cannot make dogmatic, plausible, and adequate statements about what happened in the Resurrection Ur-Wunder. \\"It will no longer do to speak vaguely and obscurely about it, as Albert Scweitzer rightly accuses theology of doing\\" (p95). Christology, then, is not the disinterested description of given, immanent facts, nor the intellectual clarification of religious experience. \\"Christological knowledge is characterized by the standpoint of faith, appears as a function of faith, and is meaningful only in the situation of faith\\" (p112). K√ºnneth declines to embrace (fully) both Logos Christology (Christ the human as pre-existent) and Spirit Christology (Christ as a man divinized by his flawless good deeds and pure religious nature). Nor does he believe that the new, paradox Christology of his day does anything more than restate the problem more eloquently: \\"it does not take us beyond the balanced static relationship between the historic man and the reigning Christ, beyond the basic starting point of the two-nature doctrine\\" (p116). Nor does he appeal to the \\"faith-community\\" alone, which leaves Faith without a decisive content. He is acutely aware that, from a Christian standpoint, \\"heresy\\" is \\"that which exalts a partial truth into the thing that matters most\\" (p117). Christology is Resurrection Christology. K√ºnneth believes that the Son has no part in either time-bound humanity, nor divine majesty : the transcendent Son belongs with God, but is at the same time in subordination to God. Jseus does not share power, rank and dignity with the Father. He is essentially homogenous with the divine image, which distinguishes him from man and connects him with God. But he does not share divine majesty until after the Resurrection, when the Father exalts the Son (later on in his treatise, K√ºnneth discusses the aeon of aeons, in which the Son returns the dominion to the Father). K√ºnneth goes so far as to say \\"we have to consider whether the post-Easter situation may not have led Paul to a profounder and more universal Christological knowledge than was possible to Jesus before his resurrection\\" (p120 - John 1:1, 8:58, 17:5,24; Phil 2:5ff). Pre-existence refers to the Sonship, not the archonic majesty of the Father [one might rightly note, in this, a sympathy towards the Orthodox rejection of Filioque in the Creed]. Christ's pre-existence in the precondition of his one-day receiving the Kyrios. The Pauline concept of kenosis does not mean that the Son emptied himself of majesty, which he did not yet possess, in fact. The true humiliation is in the change of the status of the Son in relation to both his Father, and to the world. The Son becomes sin, placing himself as a servant under both man and God, and in a position of condign and transferent punishment from the Father. \\"His exposure to the creaturely and sin-riddled character of human existence raises for the Son the question what is the real will of God and gives birth to the inner struggle for insight into God's plan\\" (p123). He cites I Cor. 15:45‚Äì47: \\"The second man is from heaven\\", noting that he disagrees with his contemporary, Paul Althaus on precisely this point : Jesus receives majesty in Matthew 28:18, not before. Nevertheless, it is true and certain that the Son possesses divine Being and Essence, as Althaus insists (Phil2:6). The Messiah is \\"he who is on his way to Resurrection\\" (p127). To sum up, the Resurrection is grounded in the obedience of the life and death of Jesus, the servant of God who is also the pre-existent Son. The historical memory and reality of Christ protects against cultic excess and also helps form living pictures of God for those who following, must live by faith (p124). Extra-Calvinisticum Quoting William Placher, Domestication of Transcendence, Louisville, 1996, (p. 66) : \\"In the famous extra- Calvinisticum, Calvin insisted, against Luther, that something of God's infinity remained uncaptureable in God's finite self-revelation in Jesus Christ...this does not imply, I think, that what we know of God is false, but only that, while true as far as it goes, it is necessarily limited to our finite capacities. Calvin's real concern here seems to have been to preserve the reality of the Incarnation, which appeared to him threatened by a view in which even Christ's humanity took on divine infinity and thereby ceased to be really human.\\" [2.13.4 and 4.17.30 are the relevant passages in the Institutes]. If we accept that the extra-Calvinisticum's motto, Finitum non- capax infinitum (the finite is not capable of the infinite), is a sound insight, it would appear that K√ºnneth is adjusting or even giving up a strictly Lutheran view on the subject, while simultaneously providing a new and better explanation for the significance and resolution of the Lutheran and Calvinist debates over the presence of the body of Christ. In separating the issue from the Eucharist, and in essentially coming down on the side of Calvin's principle, K√ºnneth has driven a wedge into dogmatic discussions of God that would prohibit such discussions apart from the doctrine and the historical reality of the Resurrection : in fact, he has conjoined them in the person and work of the Son, the bearer of both the infinite (in latent, pre- existent, and divinely right form) and the finite, through the vehicle of servanthood to both God and man. It is important to remember that for K√ºnneth, Christ assumes our mortality in more than the fashion of \\"putting on the clothes of our flesh\\" (the Gnostic view of appearances), but that he is not half-human, nor is Jesus subordinated to \\"time-bound humanity\\" : he is the transcendent Son. For K√ºnneth, steering a path between Gnosticism on the one hand, and empirical Liberalism on the other, does not mean accepting the neo- Orthodoxy of the paradox theologians. If we accept Placher's \\"post-liberal\\" reasoning on the subject, the answer as to how he does this is that he returns to the issue of the extra-Calvinisticum : that is, he returns to a wrestling with Christology that accepts the Nicene Creed, but that (unlike Logos Christianity), is unwilling to interpret the difficult Pauline passages about the Recapitulation and the relationship between the Father and the Son solely in light of a simplistic and literal reading of the first chapter of John.

Notation regarding CW complexes Let X be a CW complex and denote by \\\\mathcal{X} its set of cells. Define the incidence function \\\\kappa:\\\\mathcal{X} \\\\times \\\\mathcal{X} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{Z} in the following way: given two cells \\\\sigma and \\\\tau in \\\\mathcal{X}, let \\\\kappa(\\\\sigma,~\\\\tau) be the degree of the attaching map from the boundary of \\\\sigma to \\\\tau. The boundary operator is the endomorphism \\\\partial of the free abelian group generated by \\\\mathcal{X} defined by :\\\\partial(\\\\sigma) = \\\\sum_{\\\\tau \\\\in \\\\mathcal{X}}\\\\kappa(\\\\sigma,\\\\tau)\\\\tau. It is a defining property of boundary operators that \\\\partial\\\\circ\\\\partial \\\\equiv 0. In more axiomatic definitions one can find the requirement that \\\\forall \\\\sigma,\\\\tau^{\\\\prime} \\\\in \\\\mathcal{X} : \\\\sum_{\\\\tau \\\\in \\\\mathcal{X}} \\\\kappa(\\\\sigma,\\\\tau) \\\\kappa(\\\\tau,\\\\tau^{\\\\prime}) = 0 which is a consequence of the above definition of the boundary operator and the requirement that \\\\partial\\\\circ\\\\partial \\\\equiv 0. Discrete Morse functions A real-valued function \\\\mu:\\\\mathcal{X} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R} is a discrete Morse function if it satisfies the following two properties: # For any cell \\\\sigma \\\\in \\\\mathcal{X}, the number of cells \\\\tau \\\\in \\\\mathcal{X} in the boundary of \\\\sigma which satisfy \\\\mu(\\\\sigma) \\\\leq \\\\mu(\\\\tau) is at most one. # For any cell \\\\sigma \\\\in \\\\mathcal{X}, the number of cells \\\\tau \\\\in \\\\mathcal{X} containing \\\\sigma in their boundary which satisfy \\\\mu(\\\\sigma) \\\\geq \\\\mu(\\\\tau) is at most one. It can be shownForman, Robin: Morse Theory for Cell Complexes , Lemma 2.5 that the cardinalities in the two conditions cannot both be one simultaneously for a fixed cell \\\\sigma, provided that \\\\mathcal{X} is a regular CW complex. In this case, each cell \\\\sigma \\\\in \\\\mathcal{X} can be paired with at most one exceptional cell \\\\tau \\\\in \\\\mathcal{X}: either a boundary cell with larger \\\\mu value, or a co-boundary cell with smaller \\\\mu value. The cells which have no pairs, i.e., whose function values are strictly higher than their boundary cells and strictly lower than their co-boundary cells are called critical cells. Thus, a discrete Morse function partitions the CW complex into three distinct cell collections: \\\\mathcal{X} = \\\\mathcal{A} \\\\sqcup \\\\mathcal{K} \\\\sqcup \\\\mathcal{Q}, where: # \\\\mathcal{A} denotes the critical cells which are unpaired, # \\\\mathcal{K} denotes cells which are paired with boundary cells, and # \\\\mathcal{Q} denotes cells which are paired with co-boundary cells. By construction, there is a bijection of sets between k-dimensional cells in \\\\mathcal{K} and the (k-1)-dimensional cells in \\\\mathcal{Q}, which can be denoted by p^k:\\\\mathcal{K}^k \\\\to \\\\mathcal{Q}^{k-1} for each natural number k. It is an additional technical requirement that for each K \\\\in \\\\mathcal{K}^k, the degree of the attaching map from the boundary of K to its paired cell p^k(K) \\\\in \\\\mathcal{Q} is a unit in the underlying ring of \\\\mathcal{X}. For instance, over the integers \\\\mathbb{Z}, the only allowed values are \\\\pm 1. This technical requirement is guaranteed, for instance, when one assumes that \\\\mathcal{X} is a regular CW complex over \\\\mathbb{Z}. The fundamental result of discrete Morse theory establishes that the CW complex \\\\mathcal{X} is isomorphic on the level of homology to a new complex \\\\mathcal{A} consisting of only the critical cells. The paired cells in \\\\mathcal{K} and \\\\mathcal{Q} describe gradient paths between adjacent critical cells which can be used to obtain the boundary operator on \\\\mathcal{A}. Some details of this construction are provided in the next section. The Morse complex A gradient path is a sequence of paired cells :\\\\rho = (Q_1, K_1, Q_2, K_2, \\\\ldots, Q_M, K_M) satisfying Q_m = p(K_m) and \\\\kappa(K_m,~Q_{m+1}) eq 0. The index of this gradient path is defined to be the integer : u(\\\\rho) = \\\\frac{\\\\prod_{m=1}^{M-1}-\\\\kappa(K_m,Q_{m+1})}{\\\\prod_{m=1}^{M}\\\\kappa(K_m,Q_m)}. The division here makes sense because the incidence between paired cells must be \\\\pm 1. Note that by construction, the values of the discrete Morse function \\\\mu must decrease across \\\\rho. The path \\\\rho is said to connect two critical cells A,A' \\\\in \\\\mathcal{A} if \\\\kappa(A,Q_1) eq 0 eq \\\\kappa(K_M,A'). This relationship may be expressed as A \\\\stackrel{\\\\rho}{\\\\to} A'. The multiplicity of this connection is defined to be the integer m(\\\\rho) = \\\\kappa(A,Q_1)\\\\cdot u(\\\\rho)\\\\cdot\\\\kappa(K_M,A'). Finally, the Morse boundary operator on the critical cells \\\\mathcal{A} is defined by :\\\\Delta(A) = \\\\kappa(A,A') + \\\\sum_{A \\\\stackrel{\\\\rho}{\\\\to} A'}m(\\\\rho) A' where the sum is taken over all gradient path connections from A to A'. Basic Results Many of the familiar results from continuous Morse theory apply in the discrete setting. The Morse Inequalities Let \\\\mathcal{A} be a Morse complex associated to the CW complex \\\\mathcal{X}. The number m_q = \\\\mathcal{A}_q of q-cells in \\\\mathcal{A} is called the q^{th} Morse number. Let \\\\beta_q denote the q^{th} Betti number of \\\\mathcal{X}. Then, for any N > 0, the following inequalitiesForman, Robin: Morse Theory for Cell Complexes , Corollaries 3.5 and 3.6 hold :m_N \\\\geq \\\\beta_N, and :m_N - m_{N-1} + \\\\ldots \\\\pm m_0 \\\\geq \\\\beta_N - \\\\beta_{N-1} + \\\\ldots \\\\pm \\\\beta_0 Moreover, the Euler characteristic \\\\chi(\\\\mathcal{X}) of \\\\mathcal{X} satisfies :\\\\chi(\\\\mathcal{X}) = m_0 - m_1 + \\\\ldots \\\\pm m_{\\\\dim \\\\mathcal{X}} Discrete Morse Homology and Homotopy Type Let \\\\mathcal{X} be a regular CW complex with boundary operator \\\\partial and a discrete Morse function \\\\mu:\\\\mathcal{X} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}.

Rittelmeyer came to prominence in the early 20th century as a leading academic liberal theologian and priest in Germany and wrote several books that advocated a socially engaged \\"Christianity of deeds\\" (Tatchristentum). During the First World War he eventually became one of the most high-profile clergymen in Germany to publicly oppose the war. From the 1910s his thinking was gradually influenced by the philosopher Rudolf Steiner, and in 1922 a group of mainly Lutheran priests and theology students led by Rittelmeyer founded The Christian Community as an ecumenically oriented Christian community inspired by Steiner's writings; The Christian Community is primarily a liturgical community with only a loose common basis of faith, and for that reason rejects Christian dogmas. Rittelmeyer saw it as a continuation of the liberal Christian tradition of which he was the foremost representative in Germany in the early 20th century. Life Rittelmeyer grew up in Frankish Schweinfurt as the son of a Lutheran priest. From 1890 Rittelmeyer studied philosophy and Protestant theology at the University of Erlangen and the University of Berlin. Among his teachers were Adolf von Harnack and Julius Kaftan, and later Oswald K√ºlpe, who encouraged him to write his dissertation on Friedrich Nietzsche. In 1903 he defended his doctoral dissertation in Lutheran theology at the University of Leipzig. He also went on a study trip to meet theologians and socially-engaged ministers of the time, as well as members of the Moravian Church. From 1895 to 1902 he was a priest at the St.-Johannis-Kirche in W√ºrzburg, from which in 1903 he took up the preachership of Heilig-Geist- Kirche in Nuremberg. There he married Julie Kerler on 5 April 1904. Rittelmeyer worked and closely collaborated with Christian Geyer (1862‚Äì1929), the head preacher of the Sebalduskirche, and the pair produced two joint volumes of sermons.Gott und die Seele and Leben aus Gott Around 1910 they both led discussions with the Bavarian church council on a liberal interpretation of the Bible and the denomination. In 1916 Rittelmeyer was sent to the Neue Kirche in Berlin, working as preacher there. At first gripped by nationalist enthusiasm, he soon came to oppose the First World War and with 4 other Berlin theologians signed a proclamation of peace and understanding on the occasion of Reformation Day (October 1917).cf. Martin Greschat, Christentumsgeschichte II, S. 212, Stuttgart/Berlin/K√∂ln 1997 The Nuremberg school teacher Michael Bauer in 1910 enabled Rittelmeyer to have his first encounter with Rudolf Steiner, the founder of anthroposophy. Rittelmeyer described the encounter and discussed Steiner's personality and work in his Meine Lebensbegegnung mit Rudolf SteinerFriedrich Rittelmeyer: Meine Lebensbegegnung mit Rudolf Steiner, Stuttgart 1928 (Rudolf Steiner Enters my Life). In the Christengemeinschaft he established in September 1922, Rittelmeyer acted as its first Kultushandlungen (Priesterweihe der Begr√ºndenden und Altarsakrament). He was the first \\"Erzoberlenker\\" of the \\"Movement for Religious Revival\\" (another term for the Christengemeinschaft) and from its base in Stuttgart was its leading envoy right up to his death. Under National Socialism, he carried out a permanent balancing act: between critical intellectual discussion with Nazism in numerous publications on the one hand and his task of enabling a survival strategy for the Christengemeinschaft (for which he felt responsible) on the other.In more detail see the corresponding chapter in Gerhard Wehr: Friedrich Rittelmeyer, Stuttgart 1998 References External links * Claudia Becker: Versuche religi√∂ser Erneuerung in der Moderne am Beispiel des evangelischen Theologen FR Digital Dissertation, FU Berlin 2000 Category:1872 births Category:1938 deaths Category:People from Dillingen an der Donau Category:People from the Kingdom of Bavaria Category:German Protestant clergy Category:Anthroposophists ","title":"Friedrich Rittelmeyer"},{"id":"17637438","text":"The Larche ringlet (Erebia scipio) is a member of the subfamily Satyrinae of the family Nymphalidae.\\"Erebia Dalman, 1816\\" at Markku Savela's Lepidoptera and Some Other Life Forms It is a high-mountain butterfly found in the Alps of France and Italy.

Located about 15 km southwest of the town of Wadi as-Seer, it has a population of about 6000 people, mostly members of the Abbadi tribe. It is located on hills with high and medium altitude, in an area with many springs and famous for its olive trees and other forest trees. About 0.5 km south of the town stands the archaeological site known as Al-Iraq, dominated by a partially restored palace known locally as Qasr Al-Abd, literally \\"Palace of the Servant\\", perhaps in connection to the name etched in the nearby caves, believed to be the name of the owner of the ancient estate. There are many caves in the hills which were inhabited during the Copper Age. Iraq Al-Amir is a stop on the Jordan Trail. It is a side trip of Region 3, Salt to Wadi Zarqa (84.4 km). It is 22.3 km from Salt or 15.2 km from Fuheis. From Iraq Al-Amir, the trail makes its way to Husban (19.5 km away). Qasr al-Abd Castle of Iraq al Amir Qasr Al-Abd is one of the most important Hellenistic ruins in Jordan, especially because most of the Hellenistic ruins were built over in Roman times and again later on. The first known written description of the castle comes down to us from Flavius Josephus, the Romano-Jewish historian. His description goes back to the site's founding. The castle was used in the Hellenistic and Roman periods. The rectangular building was constructed from white limestone from the surrounding area and measures 18x37.5 metres, rising to about 14 meters. The walls are between 90 centimeters to 3.90 meters thick. Josephus maintained that it was surrounded by a moat and a protective wall. The ground floor of the castle has a north and a south gate, as well as a north and south corridor. On the west side of both gates, there are four rooms. On the east side there are steps leading to the second floor. On the north side there are water tanks and two lobbies. On the east side are seven windows for lighting and ventilation. The upper floor has bedrooms and reception rooms. This part of the castle was unfinished, and was partly destroyed by an earthquake in the fourth century BCE. In the summer of 2018, Qasr Al-Abd was renovated by the Jordanian Ministry of Tourism and Antiques. Several paved pathways were created around the structure and a building now houses a small theatre that plays an animation, narrated in Arabic and subtitled in French. The animation illustrates what is thought to be the original vision for the dwelling, a summer lodge, surrounded by water, to give the illusion of a boat floating in a sea. Women's Cooperative Iraq Al-Amir is home to the Iraq Al-Amir Women's Cooperative. The Iraq Al-Amir Knowledge Station is located a short distance opposite the parking for the cave parking. It is next to the mosque. The cooperative involves women and girls from nearby Wadi Al Seer villages and produces hand-made paper, ceramics and clay pottery, as well as hand-woven fabrics. The fabric is crafted in a traditional manner, using a hand-weaving mill and three looms. History of settlement The area was first settled in the Middle Stone Age (10,000-8000) BCE. The caves dwellings continued to be used throughout the Bronze Age, as well as the first and second parts of the Iron Age. Settlement continued throughout the 5th and 4th centuries BCE, and most flourished into the Hellenistic period, after Alexander the Great conquered the region in 332 BCE. Ptolemy Philadelphus built a city there, transferring population from Tyre in Phoenicia, so that during Hellenistic rule, Iraq al-Amir was known under the Greek name Tyros. The city particularly prospered in the Byzantine period. It was built around the 3rd century BCE, and reused under Byzantine rule before being destroyed by an earthquake. Pieces of Islamic pottery were also discovered at the site, specifically from the Umayyad and Mamluk times.

To the east of the castle stands the associated bath house of Hammam as-Sarah. Background During the Umayyad dynasty, nobles and wealthy families erected small castles in semi-arid regions to serve as their country estates or hunting lodges. For the Ummayad aristocracy, hunting was a favoured pastime and these desert castles became important places of relaxation and entertainment.Petersen, A, Dictionary of Islamic Architecture, Routledge, 2002, p. 239; Meyers, E.M. (ed.), The Oxford Encyclopedia of Archaeology in the Near East, Volume 5, Oxford University Press, 1997, p. 241 In Arabic, these desert castles are known as qusur (pl.)/qasr (sing.). They were often built close to a water source or adjacent such as a natural oasis, and frequently sited along important trading routes, such as the ancient trade routes connecting Damascus with Medina and Kufa.Khouri, R.G., The Desert Castles: A Brief Guide to the Antiquities, Al Kutba, 1988. pp 4-5 Qasr Burqu' is one of the earliest examples of a desert castle. The construction of a qasr typically followed a standard template; the main castle was a rectangular stone structure with an elaborate entrance and other buildings in the complex would include a hammam (bath house), a mosque and walled enclosures for animals. The complex also included a water reservoir or dam. Ettinghausen, R., Grabar, O. and Jenkins, M., Islamic Art and Architecture p 650, Online: The interior rooms of the main castle were ornately decorated with floor-mosaics, frescoes or wall paintings featuring designs that exhibit both eastern and western influences. Most of the desert palaces were abandoned after the Umayyads fell from power in 750, leaving many projects incompleted and others were left to erode.Petersen, A., Dictionary of Islamic Architecture, Routledge, 2002, p. 296 The ruins of these desert castles can be found across the Middle East. While the majority of qasr are situated in modern day Jordan, several qsar are located in Syria, the West Bank and Israel, either in cities (Jerusalem, Ramla), in relatively green areas (Al-Sinnabra, Khirbat al-Minya), or indeed in the desert (Qasr al- Hayr al-Gharbi and Qasr al-Hayr al-Sharqi, Jabal Sais, Hisham's Palace). Teller, M., Jordan,Rough Guides, 2002 p. 200 Castle Mosque 14 meters from Qasr Al-Hallabat The complex of Qasr al-Hallabat is located in Jordan's eastern desert. Originally a Roman fortress constructed under Emperor Caracalla to protect its inhabitants from Bedouin tribes, this site dates to the second and third century AD, although there is trace evidence of Nabatean presence at the site. It was one fort of many on the Roman highway, Via Nova Traiana, a route that connected Damascus to Aila (modern-day Aqaba) by way of Petra and Philadelphia (modern-day Amman). However, by the eighth century, the Umayyad caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik ordered the Roman structures to be demolished in order to redevelop this military site and its neighboring territory to become one of the grandest of all Umayyad desert complexes. Guided by the extant plan, he incorporated a mosque (found 15 meters from the southeast of the main structure), a complicated water system including five cisterns and a considerably large water reservoir, and a bathhouse. Furthermore, situated to the west of the palace remains an enclosed structure probably used for agricultural purposes such as cultivating olive trees and/or grapevines. While only a one-layered stone footprint of the agricultural structure is still standing, three wall sections of the mosque, including the mihrab in the southern wall, remain intact. The main palace is constructed of black basalt and limestone and has a square floor plan with towers at each corner. Grand in stature, the principal structures were further enhanced with decorative mosaics depicting an assortment of animals, detailed frescoes and highly crafted stucco carvings. The site remains to be completely restored. Approximately 1400 meters east of the palace stand the remains of the mosque at Qusayr al-Hallabat. Small in scale, it measures 10.70 by 11.80 meters and is constructed of layered limestone. Inside, two arching riwaqs divide the mosque into three sections. A rounded molding extends the perimeter of the space at the height of 2.10 meters. Similar to Qusayr 'Amra and Hammam as- Sarah, three tunnel vaults support the roof of the structure. Encircling the mosque from the north, west, and east stood a 3.30-meter wide portico. Modern town The nearby modern town of Qasr Al-Hallabat is a municipality consisting of four villages. The area is inhabited by the Bani Sakhr tribe, especially the Al-Othman family.

Hoplitomeryx, also known as \\"prongdeer\\", had five horns and sabre-like upper canines similar to a modern musk deer. Its fossilized remains were retrieved from the late 1960s onwards from reworked reddish, massive or crudely stratified silty-sandy clays (terrae rossae), which partially fill the paleo-karstic fissures in the Mesozoic limestone substrate and that are on their turn overlain by Late Pliocene-Early Pleistocene sediments of a subsequently marine, shallow water and terrigenous origin. In this way a buried paleokarst originated. The fauna from the paleokarst fillings is known as Mikrotia fauna after the endemic murid of the region (initially named \\"Microtia\\", with a c, but later corrected, because the genus Microtia was already occupied). Later, after the regression and continentalization of the area, a second karstic cycle started in the late Early Pleistocene, the neokarst, which removed part of the paleokarst fill.  Description  Life reconstruction of Hoplitomeryx by Mauricio Ant√≥n. Hoplitomeryx was a deer-like ruminant(Leinders 1984) with a pair of pronged horns above each orbit and one central nasal horn. Hoplitomerycids are not the only horned deer; before the appearance of antlered deer, members of the deer family commonly had horns. Another left-over of this stage is Antilocapra of North America, the only survivor of a once successful group related to Bovidae. The diagnostic features of Hoplitomeryx are: one central nasal horn and a pair of pronged orbital horns, protruding canines, complete fusion of the navicocuboid with the metatarsal, distally closed metatarsal gully, a non- parallel-sided astragalus,(Van der Geer 1999) and an elongated patella.(Van der Geer 2004)  Species  The Hoplitomeryx skeletal material forms a heterogeneous group, containing four size groups from tiny to huge; within the size groups different morphotypes may be present. All size groups share the same typical Hoplitomeryx features. The different size groups are equally distributed over the excavated fissures, and are therefore not to be considered chronotypes. The hypothesis of an archipelago consisting of different islands each with its own morphotype cannot be confirmed so far. The tiny and small specimens show insular dwarfism, but this cannot be said for the medium and huge specimens. Skull The situation with several co-existing morphotypes on an island is paralleled by Candiacervus (Pleistocene, Crete, Greece). Opinions about its taxonomy differ, and at present two models prevail: one genus for eight morphotypes, or alternatively, two genera for five species. The second model is based upon limb proportions only, but these are invalid taxonomic features for island endemics, as they change under influence of environmental factors that differ from the mainland. Also in Hoplitomeryx the morphotypes differ in limb proportions, but here different ancestors are unlikely, because in that case they all ancestors must have shared the typical hoplitomerycid features. In Candiacervus as well as in Hoplitomeryx, the largest species is as tall as an elk, but gracile and slender. The large variation is instead explained as an example of adaptive radiation, starting when the Oligocene ancestor colonized the island. The range of empty niches promoted its radiation into several trophic types, yielding a differentiation in Hoplitomeryx. The shared lack of large mammalian predators and the limited amount of food in all niches promoted the development of derived features in all size groups (apomorphies).

A curling house was used to store curling stones, brushes and other equipment used to maintain a curling pond and play the game of curling in Scotland and elsewhere.  Introduction  The houses were often purely functional in character, being relatively small and often located in quite isolated places. Some curling houses were built as part of country estates and were much grander in appearance. A fireplace was sometimes present and this ensured some welcome heat for players, night watchmen, etc.Burns Curling Museum, Mauchline. The construction was of stone, brick or wood as shown by paintings or surviving examples.  Purpose  Curling stones are heavy objects, and in the days of horse transport and poor quality roads it would be easier to store stones at the site of the curling pond. Additionally the ponds needed a certain degree of maintenance to the water supply, dam, weed control, etc. Tools could be stored in the house. Sometimes a watchman was employed during the season to make sure that all was well with the pond, its ice and the curling equipment. Refreshments would be provided, such as the seemingly traditional pies and porter mentioned as being served at the Eglinton flushes.Service (1890), Page 24  Scottish curling houses Image:FingaskCurlingfromILN.jpgA Curling House at Fingask Castle, Pethshire Image:Curling at Eglinton castle, Ayrshire, Scotland.jpgA curling match at the flushes, Eglinton Castle, Ayrshire, in 1860.

Soaring Society of America, November 1983. USPS 499-920 The 1-29 is a development of the Schweizer SGS 1-23 that utilizes a 1-23 fuselage and a newly constructed set of 49.2 foot (15.0 m) span wings. The aircraft was constructed to study the feasibility of producing improved boundary layer laminar flow on a metal-winged sailplane. Only one SGS 1-29 was produced and the project was not pursued further. Background In the mid-1950s the SGS 1-23 was in full production and through successive models was performing very well in competition. By 1957 the development of fiberglass-reinforced plastic affected the production of many sporting goods, such as boats and fishing rods. Schweizer Aircraft thought it was only a matter of time before a fiberglass sailplane was produced. This concern was borne out in 1965, when two German fiberglass sailplanes were entered in the world championships. Schweizer Aircraft evaluated the use of fiberglass for sailplane construction and rejected it for several reasons: * The high cost of demonstrating to the Federal Aviation Administration that this new material could safely be used for aircraft primary structure. * Problems with crash resistance of fiberglass structures in high impact accidents. * The unknown service life of fiberglass. * The high degree of manual labor required to do fiberglass lay-ups at that time and the associated cost. The company decided to concentrate on getting the best performance from the material that it knew best, aluminum. Schweizer created several design studies of new sailplanes in the mid-1950s. These included: *Schweizer 2-27 *Schweizer 7-28 *Schweizer SGS 1-29 Of these, only the SGS 1-29 proceeded to prototype stage. Design and development The 1-29 was constructed using a modified SGS 1-23G fuselage. New wings were built for the aircraft to determine if better laminar flow could be achieved on a metal wing. The wings were all-metal and of constant chord. The wing ribs were identical and created from a single master die to ensure uniformity. The wing features a thick, deep spar to reduce wing flexing and \\"oil-canning\\" that might interrupt laminar flow. The wing was assembled using flush rivets and has balanced top and bottom dive brakes. The aircraft first flew in 1958 and flight testing was reported by Schweizer Aircraft as on-going through 1959. The 1-29 program did yield positive results. The standard production model SGS 1-23H-15 with the same fuselage and wingspan as the 1-29 and a NACA 43012A airfoil, produced a best glide ratio of 29:1. With its laminar flow wing and NACA 63-618 airfoil the 1-29 recorded a 34:1 glide ratio, an improvement of 15%. The 1-29 design was never certified and the sole aircraft that was built is an experimental aircraft in the \\"racing, exhibition\\" class and registered as N3898A. Operational history The 1-29 was flown in at least three US national competitions by Paul A Schweizer, Bill Ivans and Tom Smith. Aircraft on display Once the 1-29 test program was complete, the aircraft was donated to the National Soaring Museum where it is currently listed as being in storage.

Guk and tang are commonly grouped together and regarded as the same type of dish, although tang can sometimes be less watery than guk. It is one of the most basic components in a Korean meal, along with bap (Î∞•, rice), and banchan (Î∞òÏ∞¨, side dishes). In Korean table setting, guk is served on the right side of bap (rice), and left side of sujeo (ÏàòÏ†Ä, a spoon and chopsticks). Guk is a native Korean word, while tang is a Sino-Korean word that originally meant \\"boiling water\\" or \\"soup\\". Tang has been used as an honorific term in place of guk, when it denotes the same meaning as guk as in yeonpo-tang (Ïó∞Ìè¨ÌÉï, octopus soup), daegu-tang (ÎåÄÍµ¨ÌÉï, codfish soup), or jogae-tang (Ï°∞Í∞úÌÉï, clam soup). Generally, the names of lighter soups with vegetables are suffixed with -guk, while heavier, thicker soups made with more solid ingredients used in jesa (ancestral rites) are often referred to as tang. Gamja-guk (potato soup) and gamja-tang (pork back-bone stew) are different dishes; the potato soup can be called gamjeo-tang. Types Guk is largely categorized into four groups of soups, such as malgeun jangguk (ÎßëÏùÄ Ïû•Íµ≠), gomguk (Í≥∞Íµ≠), tojangguk (ÌÜ†Ïû•Íµ≠), and naengguk (ÎÉâÍµ≠). Malgeun jangguk literally means \\"clear (malgeun, ÎßëÏùÄ) soup (guk, Íµ≠) seasoned with a condiment (jang, Ïû•),\\" such as doenjang (soy bean paste) or ganjang, and is served in a bansang (Î∞òÏÉÅ, regular meal table). The main ingredients for malgeun jangguk are meat, fish, vegetables, and seafoods. Gomguk, also called gomtang, refers to either a soup type made by boiling various beef parts such as rib, oxtail, brisket, head, and so forth for a long time, or made with ox bone by the same method. The broth of gomguk tends to have a milky color and to be rich and hearty taste. It can also be made with chicken or pork bone, to produce samgyetang or gamjatang. Tojangguk are based on doenjang broth and ssaltteumul (ÏåÄÎú®Î¨º, leftover water after washing rice for cooking). The taste is usually savory and deep. Naengguk are cold soups usually eaten in summer. These soups are usually clean and tangy, such as with oi naengguk (Ïò§Ïù¥ÎÉâÍµ≠, cold cucumber) and miyeok naengguk (ÎØ∏Ïó≠ÎÉâÍµ≠, cold wakame soup). Kkaetguk (ÍπªÍµ≠, sesame soup), made with chicken and sesame seeds, is thick and serves to replenish and supplement nutrients during hot weather.

They are also called changuk (literally \\"cold soup\\") in pure Korean while the term naengguk is a combination of a Hanja word and a pure Korean word with the same meaning. The first historical record on naengguk appears in a poem written by Yi Gyu-bo (1168‚Äì1241), a high officer of the Goryeo period (918‚Äì1392). Naengguk is referred to as \\"sungaeng\\" in the poem, which literally means sunchaeguk, soup made with sunchae (Brasenia schreberi). Yi praised its clear and plain taste. Naengguk is generally divided into two categories according to taste and ingredients. One group of naengguk is made by mixing chilled water and vinegar to give a sweet and sour taste; examples include miyeok naengguk made with wakame, oi naengguk made with cucumber, pa naengguk made with spring onions, nameul naengguk made with garlic, and gim naengguk made with gim or nori. The other group is made to supplement health and has rich tastes, such as chilled soup made with chicken, sesame, or soy bean. * Miyeok naengguk (ÎØ∏Ïó≠ÎÉâÍµ≠), cold wakame soup * Oi naengguk (Ïò§Ïù¥ÎÉâÍµ≠), cold cucumber soup * Kkaetguk (ÍπªÍµ≠), hearty cold soup made with chicken and ground sesame seeds * Naengkongguk (ÎÉâÏΩ©Íµ≠), made with ground soybeans and can be used for kongguksu * Kongnamul naengguk (ÏΩ©ÎÇòÎ¨ºÎÉâÍµ≠), made with kongnamul Ingredients * Maeuntang (Îß§Ïö¥ÌÉï): a refreshing, hot and spicy fish soup. * Haejangguk (Ìï¥Ïû•Íµ≠): a favorite hangover cure consisting usually of meaty pork spine, ugeoji (Ïö∞Í±∞ÏßÄ dried napa cabbage) coagulated ox blood (similar to blood pudding), and vegetables in a hearty beef broth; legend has it that soon after World War II, the restaurant that invented this stew was the only place open in the Jongno district when the curfew at the time lifted at 4:00 AM * Haemultang (Ìï¥Î¨ºÌÉï): made with various seafood * Haemuljaptang (Ìï¥Î¨ºÏû°ÌÉï), made with seafood and beef offal, once part of the Korean royal court cuisine * Altang (ÏïåÌÉï): can be made with myeongran jeot (Î™ÖÎûÄÏ†ì), salted and fermented Alaska pollack's roe seasoned with chili pepper or fresh roe * Chueotang (Ï∂îÏñ¥ÌÉï): made with Misgurnus mizolepis * Yongbongtang (Ïö©Î¥âÌÉï): made with chicken, carp and softshell turtle * Manduguk (ÎßåÎëêÍµ≠): mandu soup * Wanjatang (ÏôÑÏûêÌÉï): made with wanja (meatball-like jeon) * Gyerantang (Í≥ÑÎûÄÌÉï): soup made with eggs * Ssukkuk (Ïë•Íµ≠): made with ssuk (Artemisia princeps var. orientalis) * Sundaeguk (ÏàúÎåìÍµ≠): made with Sundae (or pork blood sausage) and sometimes it includes fatty pieces of intestine (gopchang), liver, lungs, bits of cartilage, and meat.Jung, Alex \\"5 Korean ways to eat a pig\\" CNN Go. 11 November 2011.

John Herlitz was born to Swedish immigrants in Pine Plains, New York. At 13, he started sending sketches of cars to Chrysler; company officials told him what education they would seek for stylists, and he proceeded to get a bachelor's degree in industrial design from the Pratt Institute. Immediately on graduation in 1964, Herlitz started working for Plymouth, creating the Barracuda SX show car which greatly influenced the 1967 Plymouth Barracuda. Herlitz was then called to the National Guard before returning to Plymouth, where he led the styling of the completely new 1970 Barracuda and 'Cuda. Mr. Herlitz married Joan Elizabeth Neinas on September 20, 1969, and had two sons and two grandchildren. Following the 1970 Barracuda, Herlitz led the styling for the 1971 Plymouth GTX and Plymouth Road Runner. He assumed progressive responsibility in the design studios, working on the styling of progressive generations of vehicles including the K-cars, minivans, and cab forward cars as well as various concept cars. In 1994, Herlitz was named vice president for product design, working directly under former engineer Tom Gale; he was later promoted to senior vice-president for product design. In June 2000, John Herlitz announced his intent to retire from Chrysler. He officially retired from Chrysler in January 2001. In his later years at Chrysler, he helped to establish the Walter P. Chrysler Museum, where his retirement party was held in November 2000. Afterwards, he helped to design a visual arts building in Michigan, served on the Interlochen Center for the Arts' corporate advisory council, and was a judge in some car shows. He died in 2008 from complications after a fall in his winter home in Florida.

The Andrew Mercer Reformatory for Women was the first women's (16 years of age or older) prison in Canada. At various times, the facility was also known as the Mercer Complex, Andrew Mercer Reformatory for Females, and Andrew Mercer Ontario Reformatory for Females.Ontario Archives History Located on King Street West in Toronto, Ontario, it opened in 1872 with the idealistic promise of a \\"homelike\\" atmosphere for its inmates. One of the major tenets of the reformatory was to instill feminine Victorian virtues such as obedience and servility. Work, such as cooking, baking, and cleaning, was also a major part of prison life. According to one superintendent of the reformatory, \\"of all wretched women the idle are the most wretched. We try to impress upon them the importance of labour, and we look upon this as one of the great means of their reformation.\\"McCord Museum The Mercer Reformatory for Women By 1965 three institutions made up what was then referred to as the Mercer Complex: the Andrew Mercer Reformatory for Women in Toronto, the Ontario Women's Guidance Centre, and the Ontario Women's Treatment Centre, both in Brampton at what would become the Vanier Centre for Women in 1970. The Treatment Centre, originally part of the reformatory in Toronto, was set up in 1955 for the treatment of alcoholism, drug addiction and psychiatric disorders. It was relocated to Brampton in 1963 and named the Ontario Women's Treatment Centre, also to become part of the Vanier Centre for Women. The Ontario Women's Guidance Centre opened in 1959 at the same site and concentrated on academic and vocational training. Under the Ontario Female Refuges Act, 1893-1964, any person, including any parent or guardian, could bring before a judge any female under the age of twenty-one years who was deemed unmanageable or incorrigible by the adult person, so that the judge could decide the female's fate. At times the Mercer Reformatory also housed female offenders under age sixteen in a separate part of the building. These separate areas were distinctly known as the Industrial Refuge for Girls from 1880 to 1905 and the Ontario Training School for Girls from 1952 to 1960. Inmates \\"Under the Female Refuges Act, the province of Ontario from 1896-1964 arrested and jailed, without trial or appeal, females from 16 to 35 whom magistrates suspected of undesirable social behaviour -- i.e. promiscuity or having a child out of wedlock.

Retrieved on February 3, 2014. has presented cases related to the abuses inflicted on women in these institutions in many legal forums. Among these cases is that of Velma Demerson and Muriel Walker, two of the many women who were subjected to several involuntary medical procedures by a reformatory doctor, a leading eugenics practitioner searching for evidence of physical deficiencies contributing to the moral defectives of \\"unmanageable women\\". After release she married the father of her child, a Chinese immigrant, which under the citizenship law of that period automatically annulled her Canadian citizenship. Velma was one of the only survivors who, 60 years after her incarceration at the Andrew Mercer Reformatory in 1939, received compensation from the Ontario government. She was 81 by then. In 2004 she wrote a book about the events titled Incorrigible, which is part of the Life Writing Series from Wilfrid Laurier University Press. In 2002 she was awarded the J.S. Woodsworth Prize for anti-racism by the New Democratic Party of Canada. Then Muriel Walker a young woman working on a promising ballet career. She also was jailed under the female refuges act and charged with Incorrigible. Muriel was also subjected to medical experimentation while incarecerated. Senator Kim Pate and CBC helped get her son Robert Burke closure and recognition for his torture as an infant in the Andrew Mercer Reformatory. As a 4 month old child Robert was brutally beaten while being cared for by the matrons of the Andrew Mercer Reformatory.All references can be viewed at, Muriel Walker.com Closure Despite its promising beginnings, the Andrew Mercer Reformatory for Women would become the centre of controversy with allegations of torture, beatings, experimental drugs, and medical procedures, all in the name of reform. In 1964, a grand jury was convened to investigate, and was brought to prominence by The Toronto Daily Star's front-page headline \\"Secret visit to Toronto dungeons: Girls' Jail Shocks Grand Jury\\". The grand jury's conclusions included finding medical care so bad that \\"we could find no one with anything good to say about it.\\" The jury also found that the rehabilitation process was so nonexistent that \\"the name of the institution should be changed to jail, since it is in no sense a reform institution.\\" Dungeon-like basement \\"bucket cells\\" used for solitary confinement were 1.2 metres by just over 2 metres, with no windows or lights. Although the grand jury's report was challenged at the time by the Ontario Minister of Reform Institutions, Allan Grossman, Toronto Star reporter Lotta Dempsey wrote that the paper's files were \\"full of stories of escapes from Mercer, harsh treatment of expectant mothers, riots\\", and more. In early 1969, the reformatory was closed, officially replaced by the Vanier Centre for Women in Brampton, and then demolished later that year. Today, the site where the old reformatory existed is now the Alan Lamport Stadium.

Chemical structure and function The precursor amino acid lysine contains two amino groups, one at the Œ±-carbon and one at the Œµ-carbon. Either can be the location of polymerization, resulting in Œ±-polylysine or Œµ-polylysine. Polylysine is a homopolypeptide belonging to the group of cationic polymers: at pH 7, polylysine contains a positively charged hydrophilic amino group. Structure of Œ±-polylysine Œ±-Polylysine is a synthetic polymer, which can be composed of either L-lysine or D-lysine. \\"L\\" and \\"D\\" refer to the chirality at lysine's central carbon. This results in poly-L-lysine (PLL) and poly-D-lysine (PDL) respectively.Sitterley, G. (2008). Poly-l-lysine cell attachment protocol. BioFiles, 3(8), 12. Œµ-Polylysine (Œµ-poly-L-lysine, EPL) is typically produced as a homopolypeptide of approximately 25‚Äì30 L-lysine residues. According to research, Œµ-polylysine is adsorbed electrostatically to the cell surface of the bacteria, followed by a stripping of the outer membrane. This eventually leads to the abnormal distribution of the cytoplasm causing damage to the bacterial cell that is produced by bacterial fermentation. Œµ-Poly-L- lysine is used as a natural preservative in food products. 369x369px Production Production of polylysine by natural fermentation is only observed in strains of bacteria in the genus Streptomyces. Streptomyces albulus is most often used in scientific studies and is also used for the commercial production of Œµ-polylysine. Œ±-Polylysine is synthetically produced by a basic polycondensation reaction. History The production of Œµ-polylysine by natural fermentation was first described by researchers Shoji Shima and Heiichi Sakai in 1977. Since the late 1980s, polylysine has been approved by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare as a preservative in food. In January 2004, polylysine became generally recognized as safe (GRAS) certified in the United States.GRAS Notice No. GRN 000135 Polylysine in food Œµ-Polylysine is used commercially as a food preservative in Japan, Korea and in imported items sold in the United States. Food products containing polylysine are mainly found in Japan. The use of polylysine is common in food applications such as boiled rice, cooked vegetables, soups, noodles and sliced fish (sushi). Literature studies have reported an antimicrobial effect of Œµ-polylysine against yeast, fungi, Gram- positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria. Polylysine has a light yellow appearance and is slightly bitter in taste whether in powder or liquid form. Polylysine in tissue culture Œ±-Polylysine is commonly used to coat tissue cultureware as an attachment factor which improves cell adherence. This phenomenon is based on the interaction between the positively charged polymer and negatively charged cells or proteins. While the poly-L-lysine (PLL) precursor amino acid occurs naturally, the poly-D-lysine (PDL) precursor is an artificial product. The latter is therefore thought to be resistant to enzymatic degradation and so may prolong cell adherence.  Polylysine in drug delivery  Polylysine exhibits high positive charge density which allows it to form soluble complexes with negatively charged macromolecules. Polylysine homopolymers or block copolymers have been widely used for delivery of DNA and proteins. Polylysine-based nanoparticles have also been shown to passively accumulate in the injured sites of blood vessels after stroke due to incorporation into newly formed thrombus, which offers a new way to deliver therapeutic agents specifically to the sites of injury after vascular damage. Chemical modification In 2010, hydrophobically modified Œµ-polylysine was synthesized by reacting EPL with octenyl succinic anhydride (OSA).Yu, et al, J. Agri Food Chem, 2010 Jan 27;58(2):1290-5. It was found that OSA-g-EPLs had glass transition temperatures lower than EPL. They were able to form polymer micelles in water and to lower the surface tension of water, confirming their amphiphilic properties. The antimicrobial activities of OSA-g-EPLs were also examined, and the minimum inhibitory concentrations of OSA-g-EPLs against Escherichia coli O157:H7 remained the same as that of EPL. Therefore, modified EPLs have the potential of becoming bifunctional molecules, which can be used either as surfactants or emulsifiers in the encapsulation of water-insoluble drugs or as antimicrobial agents.

School of Architecture Main Building, Designed by Jos√© Villagr√°n Garc√≠a in 1952 Patio next to Main Building. Commonly referred to by faculty and staff as \\"Patio de los Pinos\\" History The School is one of the follow- up institutions of the former Academia de San Carlos, the other one being the School of Arts and Design. The Academia de San Carlos offered studies in architecture since 1791, under control of the Royal and Pontifical University of Mexico. In 1910, Porfirio Diaz's government grants autonomy to the university, thus the academy was reorganized as the Escuela Nacional de Arquitectura (National School of Architecture) and the Escuela Nacional de Artes Pl√°sticas (National School of Art). In 1954 the architecture school moved to its current facilities in Ciudad Universitaria as Facultad de Arquitectura. The first postgraduate studies in both architecture and urbanism were opened in 1968. In 1969 the school opened its undergraduate program in industrial design, and in 1985 the undergraduate programs in urbanism and landscape architecture and postgraduate studies in industrial design. Staff and organization The School is run by a dean, currently B.A. Marcos Mazari Hiriart. He is aided by a Technical Council, composed of professors and student and administrative representatives, which makes decisions regarding curriculum, school calendars and schedules, among other tasks. The school includes the four undergraduate programs (architecture, landscape architecture, urbanism and industrial design), and the graduate, specialization and research programs (in architecture, urbanism and industrial design). In addition, the school holds its own architectural office, which develops projects both for the University and for external clients; and a cultural division that manages cultural events, exhibits, publications, lectures, etc. The undergraduate program in architecture is organised within five branches: project; urban-environmental; technology; theory, history and research. Furthermore, the program is spread among 16 partially independent studios or workshops which offer all the mandatory courses. These studios are physically located in eight two story buildings (except for two located in the main building). These workshops originally were conceived to perform long- standing projects and focus on experimentation of different architectural conceptions, depending on the staff that the studio had, the profile of the students was formed.

Club career Although he was taken to Scotland initially by Eddie Turnbull, manager of Aberdeen, Neef was best known for his spell at Scottish side Rangers, whom he signed for in spring 1968. A former German policeman, he was seen as the answer to the clubs problematic goalkeeping position. The manager Davie White had been struggling to find a replacement to Billy Ritchie since his departure in 1967, using Erik Sorensen and Norrie Martin but not settling on either. He made his debut on 19 April 1969 in a league match against Greenock Morton, keeping a clean sheet in a 3‚Äì0 home win. The following season, he became first choice at the club playing 39 games and winning the 1970 League Cup, after keeping out Celtic F.C. in the final. The 1970‚Äì71 season saw him lose his place to new signing Peter McCloy. His appearances were sporadic thereafter. He was part of the 1971‚Äì72 European Cup Winners' Cup squad, but never played. Neef left Rangers to return to West Germany in 1973, having made 48 appearances in total for the club. Death Neef died from throat cancer at his home in Nuremberg on 23 February 2010 . A one-minute silence was held in respect for Neef before a match at Ibrox Stadium on 28 February 2010. Personal life Melanie Neef, Neef's daughter, was an athlete for Great Britain.

UNE was available starting with Ubuntu release 8.04 (\\"Hardy Heron\\"). UNE was also an optional preinstalled operating system on some netbooks, such as Dell Inspiron Mini 10v and the Toshiba NB100, and also ran on popular models such as the Acer Aspire One and the Asus Eee PC. Canonical Ltd., the developers of Ubuntu, collaborated with the Moblin project to ensure optimization for lower hardware requirements and longer battery life. Beginning with version 10.10, Ubuntu Netbook Edition used the Unity desktop as its desktop interface. The classic netbook interface was available in Ubuntu's software repositories as an option. Because Ubuntu's desktop edition has moved to the same Unity interface as the netbook edition, starting with Ubuntu 11.04, the netbook edition was merged into the desktop edition. Installation UNE could be installed in several ways: * by first installing the regular Ubuntu package, then adding the UNE repository and installing the relevant packages. Starting with Ubuntu 10.04, the packages are available on main repositories. * by downloading UNE directly from the Ubuntu server, as either a .iso or .img file and writing the file to a USB stick (using Ubuntu Live USB Creator or UNetbootin) or CD. * an option to install via the Wubi installer is available for the Ubuntu 10.04 \\"Lucid Lynx\\" release. Unity UNE 10.10 running on an Asus Eee netbook Starting with UNE 10.10, the interface was switched to Unity. Due to the desktop version of Ubuntu also being changed to the Unity interface, the netbook edition was rolled into the general Ubuntu distribution starting with Ubuntu 11.04 Natty Narwhal and the netbook edition was discontinued as a separate distribution. Variants Dell Ubuntu Netbook Edition is built specifically for the hardware profile of the Inspiron Mini 9, and is also available for the Inspiron Mini 12. It includes a custom built interface and launcher as well as non-free codecs such as MPEG-4 and MP3. It began shipping on September 22, 2008. EasyPeasy is considered to be among the first UNE-based distributions, with a focus on the usage of proprietary software like Skype by default and also integrating a set of different standard applications and drivers.

He reached Beijing 6 June 1760, joining the Jesuits who were retained at the court of the emperor. Cibot during his many years in China found time to devote to historical and scientific studies. Modesty prevented him from signing many of his essays. His style was somewhat diffuse, and his writings were valued chiefly for their variety and the information which they contained. Works Many of his notes and observations on the history and literature of the Chinese were published in the \\"M√©moires concernant l'histoire, les sciences les arts, les moeurs, les usages, etc., des Chinois: par les missionaires de P√©kin\\" (Paris, 1776‚Äì89, 16 vols.).

Facts Mr Tom Boardman was the solicitor of a family trust.See the case report at [1967] 2 AC 46 The trust assets include a 27% holding in a company (a textile company with factories in Coventry, Nuneaton and in Australia through a subsidiary). Boardman was concerned about the accounts of the company, and thought that to protect the trust a majority shareholding is required. He and a beneficiary, Tom Phipps, went to a shareholders' general meeting of the company. They realised together that they could turn the company around. They suggested to a trustee (Mr Fox) that it would be desirable to acquire a majority shareholding, but Fox said it was completely out of the question for the trustees to do so. With the knowledge of the trustees, Boardman and Phipps decided to purchase the shares themselves. They bought a majority stake. But they did not obtain the fully informed consent of all the beneficiaries. By capitalizing some of the assets, the company made a distribution of capital without reducing the values of the shares. The trust benefited by this distribution ¬£47,000, while Boardman and Phipps made ¬£75,000. But then John Phipps, another beneficiary, sued for their profits, alleging a conflict of interest. Judgment High Court Wilberforce J held that Boardman was liable to pay for his breach of the duty of loyalty by not accounting to the company for that amount of money, but that he could be paid for his services. Court of Appeal Lord Denning MR, Russell LJ and Pearson LJ upheld Wilberforce J's decision and held that Boardman and Phipps had breached his duty of loyalty, which arose as they had become self- appointed agents representing the trust, by putting themselves in a conflict of interest. They were therefore liable for the profits earned. However, they would be able to retain a generous remuneration for the services he performed. On this, Lord Denning MR said (at 1021) House of Lords The majority of the House of Lords (Lords Cohen, Guest and Hodson) held that there was a possibility of a conflict of interest, because the solicitor and beneficiary might have come to Boardman for advice as to the purchases of the shares. They owed fiduciary duties (to avoid any possibility of a conflict of interest) because they were negotiating over use of the trust's shares. The majority disagreed about the nature and relevance of information used by Boardman and Phipps. Lord Cohen said the information is not truly property and it does not necessarily follow that, because an agent acquired information and opportunity while acting in a fiduciary capacity, he is accountable. His liability to account depends on the facts. His Lordship regarded Boardman to be liable because he acquired the information in the course of the fiduciary relationship and because of the fiduciary relationship. The other two members of the majority, Lord Hodson and Lord Guest, opined that information can constitute property in appropriate circumstances and in the current case, the confidential information acquired can be properly regarded as property of the trust. Therefore, Boardman was speculating with trust property and should be liable. The majority agreed unanimously that liability to account for the profits made by virtue of a fiduciary relationship is strict and does not depend on fraud or absence of bona fides, and so Phipps and Boardman would have to account for their profits. However, they were generously remunerated for their services to the trust. Lord Upjohn dissented, and held that Phipps and Boardman should not be liable because a reasonable man would not have thought there was any real sensible possibility of a conflict of interest. This is because there is no possibility the trustee would seek Boardman's advice to purchase the shares and at any rate Boardman could have declined to act if given such request. His Lordship distinguished Regal (Hastings) v Gulliver by restricting Regal Hastings to circumstances concerned with property of which the principals were contemplating a purchase. In the present case, as the purchase of the shares was entirely out of the question, Regal Hastings was said to be inapplicable. Lord Upjohn also agreed with Lord Cohen that information is not property at all, although equity will restrain its transmission if it has been acquired by a breach of confidence. He said unequivocally that knowledge learnt by a trustee in the course of his duties is not property of the trust and may be used for his own benefit unless it is confidential information which is given to him (i) in circumstances which, regardless of his position as a trustee, would make it a breach of confidence to communicate it to anyone or (ii) in a fiduciary capacity.

About the work ‚Äì the Three Duets  Burrows and Fargion are among the most widely travelled of UK performance artists and have gained an international reputation for the intelligence, humour and musicality of their shows. Both Sitting Duet (2002) Sitting on chairs drawn up close to the audience, staring at music and dance \\"scores\\" at their feet, the two men draw us into a silent, unexpected and often funny conversation for two pairs of arms. \\"Working mute, without instruments and almost without technique, the men become immersed in what are basically a series of brisk hand-jives. They barely rise out of their chairs as they perform. But the point of the duet is that they are able to magic their restricted vocabulary into sophisticated dance and music, twisting simple gestures into a variety of shapes and rhythms so that they mesmerise and dazzle.\\" \\"Sometimes imitative, sometimes in counterpoint, they weave a complex, witty, rhythmic tapestry, two strange characters entirely lost in obsessive movement.\\" The judges of the New York Dance and Performance Bessies awarded the 2003 prize, \\"For an extraordinary symphony of upper body gestures performed in extrasensory collaboration in an ordinary setting made tense by the silent musical score, for an intimate production by an unlikely pair of average middle-aged white guys in chairs.\\" Supported by the Arts Council England, the Jonathan Burrows Group, NOTT Dance Festival, Kaaitheater, P.A.R.T.S./Rosas and the Laban Dance Centre London. The Quiet Dance (2005) At the heart of this work is a love of rhythmic form and the quiet intensity of communication this allows them to share with each other and with the audience. \\"The duo rob themselves not only of conventional music, but also of grace. It begins with the deadpan Fargion bellowing \\"Ahhhhhhhhhh!\\" as Burrows stomps across the stage, sinking lower with each step. Then the roles switch, the stomp turns into an angular stagger, and so on. Like all good comedy, it's impeccably timed ‚Äì and, of course, it's not really that \\"quiet\\" at all.\\" \\"During one section, they riff on the verbal shorthand of different dance genres (ballroom, ballet and disco), and we can almost see them partnering each other on a real-life dance floor.\\" Co-produced by Dance 4, Nottingham, Dance Umbrella London, Joint Adventures, Munich, Kaaitheater, Brussels and supported by Arts Council England and the Jonathan Burrows Group. Speaking Dance (2006) Burrows' and Fargion's final part of the trilogy of performances. The last piece continues their exploration into how the relationship between music and dance is perceived, and the fragile but permeable boundaries between the two. \\"As the title suggests, words are the thing here, but not in any conventional sense. There is, at last, music of many kinds, but, rather than move to it, Burrows and Fargion often read out dance notation (\\"Cross! Two, three, four‚Ä¶\\") or the actual names of the notes (\\"A! B flat! D!\\") in time to it.\\" The Telegraph Co-produced by Dance Umbrella, London, supported by the Arts Council England & the Jonathan Burrows Group and with thanks to Dance 4 Nottingham.  Reviews  *\\"A surprisingly endearing conceptual comedy of such unpretentious charm that it seals Burrows and Fargion's status as a sort of Laurel and Hardy of the avant-garde.\\" The Times (The Quiet Dance). *\\"Jonathan Burrows is Britain's Columbus, dance's explorer, a man in quest of new lands and unknown territory.... He is a true original.\\" The Financial Times (The Quiet Dance). *\\"If Einstein ever pondered on dance, the dance in question would have looked something like the work of Jonathan Burrows.\\" The Guardian *\\"When composer Matteo Fargion and dancer Jonathan Burrows perform together, they are like two middle-aged boffins retreating into a garden shed. Both men are in their mid-40s, balding and dressed for comfort rather than style; when they collaborate on stage, they could almost be following an obsessively drawn up list of tasks ‚Äì phrases of material to be analysed, details of performance to be perfected, ideas to ponder. Like all the best boffins, Burrows and Fargion mix their idiosyncrasies with passion and a kind of genius. The joy of these duets is that they deliver dance and music in ways we never expect.\\" The Guardian, 8 Jan (Three Duets). *\\"Absurdist self-indulgence you'll be thinking, but what you see is revelation and joy.\\" *\\"Several times during their opening performance at Sadler's Wells, on Friday evening, Jonathan Burrows and Matteo Fargion almost reduced each other to fits of giggles. And these were among the loveliest moments. Timing being the secret of comedy, and them both having an acute sense of humour, their creation is as much like very clever vaudeville as high art, a brilliantly precise device constructed to amuse and satisfy, performed by a double act as cherishable as Laurel and Hardy or Morecambe and Wise.\\" The Telegraph, 8 January (Three Duets). *One of the funniest and most ingenious dances seen in New York in a long time.\\" The New York Times (Both Sitting Duet).  Influences and influenced  The critic Judith Mackrell has described aspects of Burrows' style as emanating from the influences of folk-dance, classicism and more weighted postmodern dance movement. Burrows describes Riverside Studios, run by David Gothard as influential in his early career. Gothard drew together important artists and Burrows would see Samuel Beckett and Dario Fo around the theatre, and John Cage and Merce Cunningham duets were performed there. After seeing them in the early 1980s, American post modern dance, especially the Judson Church generation of choreographers from New York, such as David Gordon, Steve Paxton, Trisha Brown, and Lucinda Childs and also Douglas Dunn and their Contact improvisation began to influence his thinking. He also began performing for Rosemary Butcher. He also lists Bronislava Nijinska, specifically Les Noces. Burrows' long-time colloborator Matteo Fargion studied composition with the composer Kevin Volans. Burrows consequently chose also to study with Volans, and the ideas which came out of this time are still important to Burrows' work, and a source of connection between Burrows and Fargion. Both Sitting Duet is the translation of a score of a piece of music by American composer Morton Feldman, an important figure in music, and with whom Volans was friends. Burrows learnt traditional English Morris dancing at White Lodge Royal Ballet School, and both he and critics have named this as another possible source of influence in his style. Burrows has commented that he looked for a new way of moving that he could manage better than ballet. He met this desire in contact improvisation and release work, but also in folk dances, such as the Bampton Dancers of Oxford. Burrows comments, \\"I like the traditional men's dances from England. The dancers had this weird quality of absurdity mixed with profound dignity.\\" Burrows has through his work and teaching and mentoring, been an influence on other successful choreographers.

In 1811, he was employed as factor by the Sutherland Estate in a joint (but subordinate) position with William Young. The estate had started some clearances, integral to their program of agricultural improvements. Whilst clearances in 1812 went reasonably smoothly, in 1813 Sellar failed to successfully negotiate with angry resistance in the Strath of Kildonan. A state of confrontation existed for more than six weeks and concessions ultimately had to be made by the estate to defuse the situation. In 1814, Sellar had the job of clearing some of the residents of Strathnaver. His actions here gave rise to a number of charges brought by the Sheriff- substitute Robert McKid, who was an enemy of Sellar's. The most serious of these was culpable homicide. Sellar was acquitted at his trial in April 1816, but has remained as the focus for much of the anger and indignation arising from the clearances. Sellar and Young were replaced by a new factor later in 1817, and Sutherland estate continued with even larger clearances, particularly in 1818-1820. Sellar remained on the Sutherland estate as a tenant sheep farmer, becoming successful and well respected by others in the sheep and wool sector. In 1838 Sellar bought a sheep farm at Morvern in Argyll, thereby becoming a landowner. Sellar was keen to express his opinions on the management of the Highlands, writing highly emphatic letters on the subject. He never deviated from his view that the Highland clearances were the correct course of action. As a lawyer he had had a very confrontational manner, clearly enjoying dispute and, by his own admission, being too willing to break someone in the courts. His precise view of the law is, in the eyes of some historians, his most believable defence against the charges on which he was tried - that he would always follow the process of law precisely. Early life and career Patrick Sellar was born in Elgin in Morayshire, in December 1780. This low-lying coastal agricultural area was at the forefront of agricultural experiment in northern Scotland, and Sellar's family was involved in agricultural improvement in the Northeast of Scotland between 1760 and 1800. Sellar's father, Thomas, was the son of a Banffshire stonemason who, in the more accessible Scottish education system, was able to send Thomas to Edinburgh University to study law. Thomas then returned to Elgin as a trained solicitor and found work in the country estates of the region. He soon became the leading solicitor of the area, building up a fine reputation and a status much advanced from his father's lowly origins. Patrick Sellar also studied law at Edinburgh. He then trained in his father's law practice, engaged in work for landowners who were improving and rearranging their farmlands, putting in drainage and building new farm buildings - especially on the cereal farms. Here Sellar saw in operation the theories he had learnt at Edinburgh University. The ideas of Adam Smith and Dugald Stewart were becoming dominant when the younger Sellar was a student. Given this educational environment, Sellar came to think of himself as a man of science and a product of the enlightenment. His father's business provided some degree of training for the factors on the Seafield estate, a major client of Thomas's law firm. Among these trainees were Cosmo Falconer and Robert Mackid, both of whom Patrick encountered when he moved to Sutherland. Patrick Sellar was clearly influenced by the upwardly mobile story of his family; his grandfather had been a cottar in the hills of Banff but was cleared by an improving landlord. Patrick interpreted this as a moral tale (which he was known to share with others): the shock of eviction setting his family on the path of self-improvement. Move to Sutherland The Sellar family were involved in the building of a harbour at Burghead, Thomas as an investor and Patrick carrying out legal work. As the building work finished in 1809, some of the investors travelled on the harbour's new packet service to Dunrobin Bay in Sutherland. Patrick Sellar accompanied the group, which included William Young. Young was 16 years older than Sellar, and had an impressive practical record of agricultural improvement in Morayshire. The two of them were looking for new business opportunities; Young was hoping to persuade Lord and Lady Stafford, owners of the Sutherland Estate, to invest in this new shipping service for Sutherland, which they did. Although, on a clear day, the hills of Sutherland are visible from the coast of Moray, Young and Sellar had never been there before. They were surprised to see the antiquated, unimproved farming techniques which contrasted with the modernised farms in their home county. They soon made contact with the Staffords. To prove the seriousness of their interest in Sutherland, Young and Sellar took a lease (in Sellar's name) for Culmaily, a farm in the Southeast of the estate. They agreed to pay above the rent that was usual in the area - causing concern among the neighbouring tenants. They then set about using this property as a model for modern agricultural improvement. An up-to-date drainage scheme was installed, though some marshy areas were used to grow flax (which had not previously been grown in Sutherland). A lint mill was erected to process the flax, as was a new house and other agricultural buildings. The drainage resulted in greatly increased crops of potatoes, oats and wheat. The reorganisation of the farm involved the eviction of 213 people out of a total of 253 who had previously lived and worked there. Young and Sellar expected them to be employed in industries being set up elsewhere on the estate. Whilst applying their energies to demonstrating their methods, the pair offered much free advice on improvement to Lady Stafford, which she was keen to hear. This happened at a key moment for the estate, which had recently started on a large program of improvement. The Sutherland estate In 1809, when Patrick Sellar first visited the county of Sutherland, the Sutherland estate was the major landowner in the county. Some purchases between 1812 and 1816 increased the holding, calculated on rental value, to 63% of the county. It was managed from Dunrobin Castle, with the estate factor usually taking one of the farms in the immediate vicinity of the castle. Whilst Lady Stafford was a child, her guardians had made some modest progress at improving the rental income by modernisation. Some tenants were cleared in 1772 and some of the tacksmen were removed at about that time. The establishment of fishing villages and the introduction of sheep, though considered, were not done due to a lack of the necessary capital to invest in these changes. This shortage of money continued in the early years of the Stafford's marriage, however, in 1799 some clearances were carried out, together with rent increases. Then, in 1803, her husband inherited the huge fortune of the Duke of Bridgewater. This made Lord Stafford arguably the richest man in Britain and he was happy to channel a large part of that wealth into his estates in Sutherland, one of the poorest parts of the country. Despite the conventions of the day, much of the Sutherland estate's decision-making was delegated to Lady Stafford by her husband. She was impatient for progress. Most of the leases on the estate did not expire until 1807, but planning got underway immediately. The plans centred around establishing large sheep farms in the interior, eliminating the tacksman class, and establishing alternative occupations for the displaced tenants, housing them in crofts on the coast. These included fishing, for which harbours and villages had to be built, new coal workings at Brora and associated salt pans. The estate went through a sequence of factors: David Campbell was hired in 1802, but Lady Stafford was critical of his lack of progress. He left in 1807. The replacement was Cosmo Falconer. After Young and Sellar's arrival in 1809 and their frequent advice to Lady Stafford, Falconer's position was being steadily undermined. Eventually, in August 1810 he tendered his resignation, with effect from Whitsun 1811. Appointment as factor After Falconer's resignation, William Young and Patrick Sellar were appointed in the position of factor, as a joint role. From the outset, this arrangement was poorly defined. Sellar had a sequence of letters with Lady Stafford over this, trying to establish an equal status with Young. His persistence led her to consider terminating his employment when he had just taken up his duties. Lady Stafford's frustration over her new employee is evidence of Sellar's poor interpersonal skills. The conclusion was that Young had the senior position and was responsible for 'progressive improvements' on the estate, whilst Sellar collected rents, kept accounts, drafted leases, ensured tenants complied with the terms of their leases and enforced the protection of plantations and game on the estate. Clearances The first clearances under the factorship of Young and Sellar were in Assynt in 1812, under the direction of Sellar, establishing large sheep farms and resettling the old tenants on the coast. Sellar had the assistance of the local tacksmen in this and the process was conducted without unrest - despite the unpopularity of events. However, in 1813, planned clearances in the Strath of Kildonan were accompanied by riots: an angry mob drove prospective sheep farmers out of the valley when they came to view the land, and a situation of confrontation existed for more than 6 weeks, with Sellar failing to successfully negotiate with the protesters. Ultimately, the army was called out and the estate made concessions such as paying very favourable prices for the cattle of those being cleared. This was assisted by landlords in surrounding districts taking in some of those displaced and an organised party emigrating to Canada. The whole process was a severe shock to Lady Stafford and her advisers, who were, in the words of historian Eric Richards, \\"genuinely astonished at this response to plans which they regarded as wise and benevolent\\". Further clearances were scheduled in Strathnaver taking effect at Whitsun, 1814. These were complicated by Sellar having successfully bid, in December 1813, for the lease of one of the new sheep farms on land that it was now his responsibility, as factor, to clear. In later years, Sellar claimed that he had bid for this lease on the spur of the moment. In his role as factor, he was legally precise in issuing the required notices of eviction to those being resettled, doing this in January 1814 in conjunction with rent collections. In March, Sellar's shepherds started to burn the heather on the hillsides that would soon make up his sheep farm. This was a standard management technique to promote new grass growth to feed sheep. It caused consternation among the outgoing tenants, as it deprived their cattle of food, so putting them in poor condition for their imminent sale. A further problem was that Young was slow in organising the setting out of the new coastal lots, and in March and April, those under notice of eviction had no details on where they were to go: each needed time to build a house. At Young's request, Sellar made concessions to some tenants, allowing them to stay in their properties a little longer - but this just created confusion among those evicted. The delay was a problem for Sellar - his newly purchased flock of sheep was temporarily housed at his farm at Culmaily, but were short of food due to the level of overstocking and started to die. Some tenants moved in advance of the date in their eviction notice - others stayed until the eviction parties arrived. As was normal practice, the roof timbers of cleared houses were destroyed to prevent re-occupation after the eviction party had left. On 13 June 1814, this was done by burning in the case of Badinloskin, the house occupied by William Chisholm. Accounts vary, but it is possible that his elderly and bedridden mother-in-law was still in the house when it was set on fire. In James Hunter's understanding of events, Sellar ordered her to be immediately carried out as soon as he realised what was happening. The old lady died 6 days later. Eric Richards suggests that the old woman was carried to an outbuilding before the house was destroyed. Robert Mackid Sellar had made an enemy of the sheriff-substitute of Sutherland, Robert Mackid, by catching him poaching on the Sutherland estate. This incident in the winter of 1813-1814 was actually a second offence - Sellar had warned Mackid about poaching in the spring of 1811. Lady Stafford decided to deal with the embarrassment of the county's law officer breaking the law by declaring an amnesty for 24 poachers, with Mackid's name included. Mackid now intended to discredit Sellar in any way he could. Sellar's precise view of the law meant he felt Mackid had no right to his legal position. The two were now implacable enemies. The trial Sellar was charged by Mackid with culpable homicide and arson. As the trial approached, the Sutherland estate was reluctant to assist Sellar in his defence, distancing themselves from their employee. He was acquitted of all charges at his trial on 23 April 1816. The estate were hugely relieved, taking this as a justification of their clearance activity. (Robert Mackid became a ruined man and had to leave the county, providing Sellar with a grovelling letter of apology and confession.) Dismissal and famine William Young was keen to relinquish his role on the Sutherland Estate. After an extensive review of the estate over the summer of 1816 by James Loch, Young's resignation was accepted. This left the problem of Sellar, and now Loch was prepared to lay out the deficiencies of Sellar's personality for the role of estate factor to the Staffords. To some extent, this put Sellar in the role of scapegoat for all the problems on the estate, rather than just those of Sellar's own creation. The intended replacement was Frances Suther as factor, but he was not immediately available, so Sellar remained in post until Whitsun 1817. The winter of 1816/17 was severely affected by famine (as was much of Western Europe). As factor, Sellar was responsible for buying relief supplies for the tenantry. Rent collections fell as the famine struck. Sellar's plans for purchase of supplies were regarded as over-generous by the estate, so there was great hardship in many parts of Sutherland. Sellar started advocating emigration of the impoverished population and eventually Loch started to adopt the same thinking. It could be considered paradoxical that Sellar was working hard to provide famine relief to the tenants of the interior regions who he believed should be removed to provide a more economically rational method of management of the estate. The famine relief was provided as a loan to tenants, and Loch became depressed that it was unlikely that this would ever be paid off. Sellar as sheep farmer Sellar remained as the tenant of the new sheep farm in Strathnaver, Rhiloisk. The delays in moving his stock into Strathnaver in 1814 had cost him dearly. However, the death of Sellar's father in August 1817 meant that he inherited a rental of about ¬£1,000. With this extra income available, he applied his enormous energy to sheep farming and soon became much respected in the industry. He was a major tenant of the Sutherland estate, and he continued an extensive correspondence with them over the details of his tenancy. Further clearances added to his property in 1819, but he was specifically forbidden to take any part in the clearance activity. Sellar died in Elgin, Moray in 1851 and is buried in Elgin Cathedral. Family Sellar had a number of children with his wife Ann Craig of Barmakelty including: * Thomas Sellar, a merchant in New Orleans * Patrick Plenderleath Sellar, a farmer * William Young Sellar (22 February 1825 ‚Äì 12 October 1890), a Scottish classical scholar * Robert Sellar (1828‚Äì1900) who became an Australian merchant * John Alexander Sellar, a merchant in London * David Plenderleath Sellar, an American merchant * Alexander Craig Sellar MP (17 October 1835 ‚Äì 16 January 1890), a Scottish lawyer and Liberal politician.

It was first described to science in 2007, and is one of four species in the genus Malo.Gershwin, L. (2007). Malo kingi: A new species of Irukandji jellyfish (Cnidaria: Cubozoa: Carybdeida), possibly lethal to humans, from Queensland, Australia. Zootaxa 1659 55-68. It has some of the world's most potent venom, even though it is no bigger than a human thumbnail.Malo kingi. Science Channel. As an Irukandji, it can cause Irukandji syndrome, characterized by severe pain, vomiting, and rapid rise in blood pressure. It is named after victim Robert King, a tourist from the United States swimming off Port Douglas, Queensland, who died from its sting.  Anatomy and appearance  M. kingi are Irukandji jellyfish. They are sometimes halo banded, meaning they have halo-like rings encircling their tentacles. They are bell-shaped with light purple nematocyst warts. The bell is transparent, colourless and has height of 31 mm. They also have a frown-shaped rhopaliar niche ostium, perradial lappets that have two rows of warts, palmate velarial canals, and two median lensed eyes. Its primary tentacular cnidae are club shaped. The rhopaliar horns are short, broad, and curved.  Range  M. kingi are local to Queensland, Australia. A very small number of M. kingi are found during the year in late summer and early winter. Non-halo form M. kingi are found more often than the ones with a halo form.  Toxicity  M. kingi are small and inconspicuous, but extremely venomous. This makes it hard for potential victims to see them before they are stung. The death of Robert King is the only proof of their venom being deadly. There have been other incidents of them stinging people. Lisa-Ann Gershwin, an Australian marine stinger advisor, was stung while studying M. kingi. She was stung on both hands, which blistered badly. A week later several layers of her skin peeled off. According to Gershwin, a young girl was also stung and experienced nausea, severe pain, and discomfort. Since there have been different outcomes for people that have been stung, scientists believe that as a M. kingi matures its venom becomes stronger. They also believe that the non-halo forms may be less venomous.  Death of Robert King  In 2002 U.S. tourist Robert King went to Queensland, Australia. While snorkeling he was stung by a M. kingi. King died due to jellyfish sting-induced hypertension and intracranial hemorrhage. His death brought awareness of M. kingi and led to more research being done on them. The species was named in his honor.

It is part of the 56th Operations Group at Luke Air Force Base, Arizona, where it trains pilots on the Lockheed Martin F-35A. History World War II Initially established under Third Air Force in early 1942 as a fighter squadron at Baer Field, Indiana, flying some antisubmarine patrols in the Gulf of Mexico. Deployed to the European Theater of Operations in June 1942 without aircraft as its P-40s and P-39s were deemed unsuitable for use against German aircraft in long-range bomber escort duties. Was re-equipped with RAF Supermarine Spitfire Vs and its pilots and technicians spent a two-month period undergoing intensive training in flying and fighting with RAF pilots in the British aircraft from airfields in southeast England. The squadron flew its first combat mission on 18 August 1942, when it attacked enemy positions in occupied France. Assigned to the new Twelfth Air Force and deployed to Gibraltar in November 1942 as part of the Operation Torch invasion forces, initially operating from former Vichy French airfields in Algeria. Advanced east across Algeria and Tunisia during the North African Campaign, supporting the Fifth United States Army which halted Field Marshal Rommel's advance on allied positions. 308th FS, May 1944, P-51D-5-NA Mustang 44-13524 in foreground Spitfires from the squadron provided support for Allied Forces as the Invasion of Italy began with the capture of Sicily, and later the landings by Allied forces in Fascist Italy, moving north supporting the Fifth Army during the Italian Campaign. As Allied bomber forces operating from Italy began the strategic bombing of Axis petroleum and communications facilities in central Europe and the Balkans, the squadron was re-equipped with the North American P-51 Mustang to replace the shorter-ranged Spitfire. In August 1944, the P-51's were involved in the invasion of Southern France. In December 1944, the first destruction of a German jet fighter by a 308th P-51 occurred, eventually operating from the Po Valley in Northern Italy at the end of the European War in May 1945. By war's end, the squadron had earned two Distinguished Unit Citations and was involved in eight campaigns The squadron was largely demobilized during the summer of 1945 in Europe, a skeleton force returned to Drew Field, Florida in August, inactivating largely as an administrative unit in November. Reactivated from elements of several inactivating organizations in Germany in August 1946, Performed occupation duty and operating early-model P-80A Shooting Star jets from former Luftwaffe jet-capable airfields at Giebelstadt and Kitzingen. Returned to the United States in June 1947 without personnel or equipment which remained in Germany.

F-100D s/n 56-3397 in a revetment, Tuy Hoa AB, Vietnam, with a munitions jammer loading a M117 bomb Assigned to Strategic Air Command at Langley Field, Virginia as a fighter-escort squadron, equipped with straight-winged Republic F-84E Thunderjets. Assigned to Turner Air Force Base, Georgia with mission of long-range escort of Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombers, later Boeing B-50 Superfortresses and Convair B-36 Peacemakers as newer aircraft came into operation by SAC. Relieved from assignment to SAC and made non-operational in 1957 with phaseout of B-36 and end of SAC escort fighter concept. On 1 April 1957 the parent 31 SFW was transferred back to Tactical Air Command and moved to George Air Force Base, California. Trained in tactical air support of ground forces, deploying to NATO bases for operational exercises. Reassigned to Homestead Air Force Base, Florida after the Cuban Missile Crisis, late 1962 to provide air defense of South Florida. On 8 February 1964 the 308th Fighter Squadron flew a non-stop mission from Homestead to Cigli Air Base, Turkey. The 6,600-mile trip required eight in- flight refuelings and set a new record for the longest mass flight of jet aircraft to cross the Atlantic. The flight also led to the wing receiving the Tactical Air Command Outstanding Fighter Wing Award for 1964, the second consecutive year it won that prestigious award. Was deployed to Southeast Asia, 1964 as part of advisory forces operating against North Vietnamese and National Liberation Front forces in South Vietnam. For its efforts in Southeast Asia from 16 December 1966 to 15 October 1970, the 308th was awarded the Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross with Palm. The 308th Fighter Squadron also won the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award with Combat \\"V\\" Device. Reassigned back to TAC at Homestead in 1970, as part of re-establishment of 31st TFW upon its return from duty in Southeast Asia. Equipped with McDonnell F-4E Phantom IIs. Was deployed to Thailand, July 1972, engaging North Vietnamese forces in northern South Vietnam in response to the communist spring offensive. Returned to the United States in the late fall, 1972. For the next 20 years, performed routine training and tactical deployments from Homestead AFB. At the end of 1986 the squadron and wing changed tail codes from ZF to HS which better matched the squadrons location in Homestead. Upgraded to the General Dynamics F-16A Fighting Falcon in 1988, upgrading to receive Shaw AFB block 25s in August 1990. With the Gulf War build up and the 363rd TFW at Shaw AFB deploying to Saudi Arabia meant no more block 25s were available. With some F-16A/B block 15s still in service for the 308th TFS, it continued to operate both types. Modern era General Dynamics F-16A Block 15Q Fighting Falcon AF Serial No. 83-1080 of the 308th FS, about 1988. When Desert Storm ended it was decided to convert the 31st TFW to block 40 F-16s instead. Up to this point about ten block 25s had reached the 308th FS and had been pained in 'Emerald Knight' markings. They were all sent to other units. Neither of the 31st TFWs other sister squadrons flew the block 25. In March 1991 the 308th began conversion to the block 40 version of the F-16. On 1 October 1991 the word 'Tactical' was dropped and unit became the 308th Fighter Squadron. By early 1992 the conversion to block 40 F-16s with the general purpose role was complete. Moved to Moody AFB, Georgia in late August 1992 when Hurricane Andrew threatened South Florida. It was to be a temporary move to Moody, but Homestead was so heavily damaged it was never re-opened for any of the 31st FW squadrons After destruction of Homestead AFB, was reassigned permanently to the 347th Operations Group at Moody. At this point the 'HS' tail code began to be replaced with a 'MY' tail code. In fact some block 40 F-16s were delivered right from the factory to the 308th Fighter Squadron's new home base. It deployed to Saudi Arabia from, March‚ÄìJune 1995 in support of Operation Southern Watch. On 1 April 1994 the unit reassigned to Luke Air Force Base, Arizona where it became a training unit. Training by the 308th FS is not a typical syllabus as the 308th FS is the main training hub for turning out instructor pilots. The 'Emerald Knights' mission is to ' Train . . . F-16 pilots and deploy combat ready airmen...' The role of training instructor pilots is not exclusive and the 308th FS still has classes of crew which are new to the Viper. The 308th ranks tenth as the most highly decorated unit in Air Force history among the 152 fighter squadrons that were ever active. With a long and distinguish service record dating from 1942, it has service around the world from Southeast Asia to Europe. Fighter Training The 308th (\\"Emerald Knights\\", Tailband: Green & White (checkerboard)), flew Block 42 F-16C/Ds conducting F-16 Fighting Falcon training for active duty USAF pilots. On 25 June 2015 the unit inactivated. On 5 December 2018, the USAF reactivated the 308th Fighter Squadron as an F-35A Lightning II training unit, primarily training F-35 crew for the Royal Danish Air Force and Royal Netherlands Air Force at Luke Air Force Base.https://www.airforce- technology.com/news/usaf-308th-fighter-squadron-luke-afb/ Lineage * Constituted as the 308th Pursuit Squadron (Interceptor) on 21 January 1942 : Activated on 30 January 1942 : Redesignated 308th Fighter Squadron on 25 May 1942 : Redesignated 308th Fighter Squadron, Single Engine on 20 August 1943 : Inactivated on 7 November 1945 * Activated on 20 August 1946 : Redesignated 308th Fighter Squadron, Jet on 15 June 1948 : Redesignated 308th Fighter- Bomber Squadron on 20 January 1950 : Redesignated 308th Fighter-Escort Squadron on 16 July 1950 : Redesignated 308th Strategic Fighter Squadron on 20 January 1953 : Redesignated 308th Fighter-Bomber Squadron on 1 April 1957 : Redesignated 308th Tactical Fighter Squadron on 1 July 1958 : Redesignated 308th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron on 9 October 1980 : Redesignated 308th Tactical Fighter Squadron on 1 October 1986 : Redesignated 308th Fighter Squadron on 1 November 1991 : Inactivated on 25 June 2015 * Activated on 30 November 2018 Assignments * 31st Pursuit Group (later 31st Fighter Group), 30 January 1942 ‚Äì 7 November 1945 * 31st Fighter Group (later 31st Fighter-Bomber Group, 31st Fighter Escort Group), 20 August 1946 (attached to 31st Fighter-Escort Wing after 27 July 1951) * 31st Fighter-Escort Wing (later 31st Strategic Fighter Wing, 31st Fighter-Bomber Wing, 31st Tactical Fighter Wing), 16 June 1952 : Attached to Alaskan Air Command, 5 December 1956 ‚Äì 7 January 1957 : Attached to Unknown, 15‚Äì21 August 1958, 22 August 1958 ‚Äì 19 January 1959, 11 July-c.

The instrument was created in 2008 by Dutch luthier Yuri Landman for guitar player Laura-Mary Carter of Blood Red Shoes.Article on modernguitars.com Technical information The string set up of the guitar is 1 bass string, 3 wound guitar strings for the chords and a cluster of 3 unwound strings tuned off-key unison, causing a rapid vibrating tone. Each group of strings has its own individual output for three amplifiers to preserve tonal interference. The sound simulates three musicians at once; a bass player, a rhythm guitarist and a solo guitarist or a Greek electric bouzouki. The instrument also is fitted with a so-called tailed bridge (as on a Fender Jaguar) to increase overtone possibilities. The electronics contain switches to change the 3-way system to stereo or mono if fewer amplifiers are available. Landman handed over his prototype to Carter before their sold out gig on May 19, 2008 in the venue Doornroosje in Nijmegen, Holland.Youtube clip of Doornroosje where Steven and Laura mention the instrument This is the first guitar created by Landman which is put in serial production. The reproductions have a red or blank body.http://www.hypercustom.com www.hypercustom.com Springtime II A few months after the first Springtime, Landman built the Springtime II on specifications made up by Lou Barlow.Picture of Barlow's alternate Springtime Barlow's version has eight tuning pegs, two of them unused, but available for an alternative seven or eight string set up. The other six employ the strings for the instruments in four positions similar to a bass guitar, but the upper two positions are double coursed strings. Because of this the instrument remains a six string guitar. Also the pickup configuration is different and four single coils are present instead of three. The lowest positioned pickup is left out and a regular bridge and neck pickup are placed aside of the rotated pickup duo. The velcro tape to mute undesired string resonance from the tailed bridge is also not present on this version. Mauro's Springtime with 5 pickups instead of 3 Also other alternate versions of the Springtime exist. For Mauro Pawlowski of dEUS Landman made an alternate version with nine tuning pegs and an additional pick up in the tail to explore the possibilities of creating third bridge sounds. This pick up has a separate output. Also a fifth pick up was added, similar to the bridge pick up present at Barlow's version. Also a red version for Meric Long of The Dodos is made with an alternate pickup and string configuration. A red Springtime was used by Placebo frontman Brian Molko in 2008, while he was in the studio for recording Battle for the Sun. On the Battle for the Sun bonus DVD, Molko is seen experimenting with the Springtime and discussing its possible uses with producer David Bottrill.

Its name comes from the Latin 'defensa' (fenced) referring to land that was fenced, and usually destined for pasture.Fra. Paleo (2010) Dehesas may be private or communal property (usually belonging to the municipality). Used primarily for grazing, they produce a variety of products, including non-timber forest products such as wild game, mushrooms, honey, cork, and firewood. They are also used to raise the Spanish fighting bull and the Iberian pig. The main tree component is oaks, usually holm (Quercus ilex) and cork (Quercus suber). Other oaks, including melojo (Quercus pyrenaica) and quejigo (Quercus faginea), may be used to form dehesa, the species depending on geographical location and elevation. Dehesa is an anthropogenic system that provides not only a variety of foods, but also wildlife habitat for endangered species such as the Spanish imperial eagle.Joffre et al. (1999); Huntsinger et al. (2004); McGrath (2007) By extension, the term can also be used for this style of rangeland management on estates. Nature Dehesa in Extremadura, Spain The dehesa is derived from the Mediterranean forest ecosystem, consisting of grassland featuring herbaceous species, used for grazing cattle, goats, and sheep, and tree species belonging to the genus Quercus (oak), such as the holm oak (Quercus ilex sp. ballota), although other tree species such as beech and pine trees may also be present. Oaks are protected and pruned to produce acorns, which the famous black Iberian pigs feed on in the fall during the montanera.Parsons (1962) Ham produced from Iberian pigs fattened with acorns and air-dried at high elevations is known as Jam√≥n ib√©rico (\\"presunto ib√©rico\\", or \\"pata negra\\" in Portuguese), and sells for premium prices, especially if only acorns have been used for fattening. In a typical dehesa, oaks are managed to persist for about 250 years. If cork oaks are present, the cork is harvested about every 9 to 12 years, depending on the productivity of the site. The understory is usually cleared every 7 to 10 years to prevent the takeover of the woodland by shrubs of the rock rose family (Cistaceae), often referred to as \\"jara\\", or by oak sprouts. Oaks are spaced to maximize overall productivity by balancing light for the grasses in the understory, water use in the soils, and acorn production for pigs and game.Joffre et al. (1999) There is debate about the origins and maintenance of the dehesa, and whether or not the oaks can reproduce adequately under the grazing densities now prevailing. Importance and economic context A dehesa in the Montes de Toledo The dehesa system has great economic and social importance on the Iberian Peninsula because of both the large amount of land involved and its importance in maintaining rural population levels. The major source of income for dehesa owners is usually cork, a sustainable product that supports this ancient production system and old growth oaks.McGrath (2007) High end black iberian pigs and sale of hunting rights also represent significant income sources. Periodic hunts in the dehesa are known as the monteria. Groups attend a hunt at a private estate and wait at hunting spots for game to be driven to them with dogs. They usually pay well for the privilege, hunting wild boar, red deer and other species. The area of dehesa usually coincides with areas that could be termed \\"marginal\\" because of both their limited agricultural potential (due to the poor quality of the soil) and a lack of local industry, which results in isolated agro- industries and very low capitalization.  Extent  Dehesa covers nearly 20,000 square kilometers on the Iberian Peninsula, mainly in: ;Portugalhttp://ga2014.fsc.org/opinion-analysis-74.the-dehesas-and-cork- production-today-and-its-alliance-with-fscFrancisco Manuel Parejo Moorish, 2010 *Alentejo *The Algarve ;Spain *C√≥rdoba *Extremadura *Salamanca *Sierra Morena **Sierra Norte de Sevilla **Sierra de Aracena See also * Caba√±eros National Park * List of types of formally designated forests * Satoyama * Silvopasture * Wood pasture References  Notes   Bibliography  * Fra.

Canada's boreal forest is a vast region comprising about one third of the circumpolar boreal forest that rings the Northern Hemisphere, mostly north of the 50th parallel.State of Canada's Forests: 2004-2005, The Boreal Forest, Canadian Forest Service, , p. 43 Other countries with boreal forest include Russia, which contains the majority, the United States in its northernmost state of Alaska, and the Scandinavian or Northern European countries (e.g. Sweden, Finland, Norway and small regions of Scotland). In Europe, the entire boreal forest is referred to as taiga, not just the northern fringe where it thins out near the tree line. The boreal region in Canada covers almost 60% of the country's land area.Canadian Boreal Initiative online, http://www.borealcanada.ca/boreal-did- you-know-e.php ; State of Canada's Forests: 2004‚Äì2005, p. 43. The Canadian boreal region spans the landscape from the most easterly part of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador to the border between the far northern Yukon and Alaska. The area is dominated by coniferous forests, particularly spruce, interspersed with vast wetlands, mostly bogs and fens. The boreal region of Canada includes eight ecozones. While the biodiversity of regions varies, each ecozone has a characteristic native flora and fauna.State of Canada's Forests: 2004‚Äì2005, p. 45, Map \\"Canada's Boreal Forest\\" inside back cover The boreal forest zone consists of closed-crown conifer forests with a conspicuous deciduous element (Ritchie 1987).Ritchie, J.C. 1987. Postglacial Vegetation of Canada. Cambridge Univ. Press, Cambridge, UK. 178 p. The proportions of the dominant conifers (white and black spruces, jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.), tamarack, and balsam fir) vary greatly in response to interactions among climate, topography, soil, fire, pests, and perhaps other factors. The boreal region contains about 13% of Canada's population. With its sheer vastness and forest cover, the boreal makes an important contribution to the rural and aboriginal economies of Canada, primarily through resource industries, recreation, hunting, fishing and eco-tourism. Hundreds of cities and towns within its territory derive at least 20% of their economic activity from the forest, mainly from industries like forest products, mining, oil and gas and tourism.State of Canada's Forests: 2004‚Äì2005, p. 55. The boreal forest also plays an iconic role in Canada's history, economic and social development and the arts.State of Canada's Forests: 2004‚Äì2005, p. 48. Overview Location and size The Canadian boreal forest is a very large bio-region that extends in length from the Yukon-Alaska border right across the country to Newfoundland and Labrador. It is over 1,000 kilometres in width (north to south) separating the arctic tundra region from the various landscapes of southern Canada. The taiga growth (as defined in North America) along the northern flank of the boreal forest creates a transition to the tundra region at the northern tree line. On the southern flank, the mountainous terrain in British Columbia that continues into the foothills of the Rockies in central Alberta makes it difficult or impossible to identify a transition zone between the northern alpine boreal forest and the montane and temperate rain forests further south. However, across the Prairie Provinces, a band of aspen parkland clearly marks the change from boreal forest to grassland. In Central Canada, a transition from northern boreal forest to the deciduous woodlands of Southern Ontario can be found in the southeastern boreal shield region of Central Ontario and western Quebec. It consists mainly of mixed coniferous and broad- leaf woodlands Canada's boreal forest is considered to be the largest intact forest on earth, with around three million square kilometres still undisturbed by roads, cities and industrial development. Its high level of intactness has made the forest a particular focus of environmentalists and conservation scientists who view the untouched regions of the forest as an opportunity for large-scale conservation that would otherwise be impractical in other parts of the world. General forest ecology The Canadian boreal forest in its current form began to emerge with the end of the last Ice Age. With the retreat of the Wisconsin Ice Sheet 10,000 years ago, spruce and northern pine migrated northward and were followed thousands of years later by fir and birch.State of Canada's Forests, 2004-2005, pp. 46-47. About 5,000 years ago, the Canadian boreal began to resemble what it is today in terms of species composition and biodiversity. This type of coniferous forest vegetation is spread across the Northern Hemisphere. These forests contain three structural types: forest tundra in the north, open lichen woodland further south, and closed forest in more southern areas.Archibold, O. W. 1995. Ecology of World Vegetation. London: Chapman and Hall. White spruce, black spruce and tamarack are most prevalent in the four northern eco-zones of the Taiga and Hudson Plains, while spruce, balsam fir, jack pine, white birch and trembling aspen are most common in the lower boreal regions. Large populations of trembling aspen and willow are found in the southernmost parts of the Boreal Plains.\\"Canada's Boreal Forest\\", Forest Products Association of Canada, map, inside front cover. One dominant characteristic of the boreal is that much of it consists of large, even-aged stands, a uniformity that owes to a cycle of natural disturbances like forest fires, or outbreaks of pine beetle or spruce budworm that kill large tracts of forest with cyclical regularity.Ludwig, D., D. D. Jones, and C. S. Holling. 1978. Qualitative analysis of insect outbreak systems: the spruce budworm and forest. Journal of Animal Ecology 47: 315‚Äì332. For example, the many stands of white spruce, black spruce, and balsam fir are vulnerable to the cyclical outbreaks of a species of the spruce budworm, the Choristoneura fumiferana.Swaine, J.M.; Craighead, F.C.; Bailey, J.W. 1924. Studies on the spruce budworm Cacoecia fumiferana Clem. Can. Dep. Agric., Ottawa ON, Tech. Bull. 37 (N.S.).Balch, R.E.; Webb, F.E.; Morris, R.F. 1954. Results of spraying against spruce budworm in New Brunswick. Can. Dep. Agric., For. Biol. Div., Ottawa ON, Bi-mo. Progr. Rep. 10(1). Since the melting of the great ice sheet, the boreal forest has been through many cycles of natural death through fire, insect outbreaks and disease, followed by regeneration. Prior to European colonization of Canada and the application of modern firefighting equipment and techniques, the natural burn/regeneration cycle was less than 75 to 100 years, and it still is in many areas.\\"The Nature of Forest Fires,\\" State of Canada's Forests, 2003-2004, , p. 47. Terms like old growth and ancient forest have a different connotation in the boreal context than they do when used to describe mature coastal rain forests with longer-lived species and different natural disturbance cycles. However, the effects of forest fires and insect outbreaks differ from the effects of logging, so they should not be treated as equivalent in their ecological consequences. Logging, for example, requires road networks with their negative impacts,Forman, R. T. T., D. Sperling, J. Bissonette, A. P. Clevenger, C. D. Cutshall, V. H. Dale, L. Fahrig, R. France, C. R.

Washington: Island Press. and it removes nutrients from the site, which may deplete nutrients for the next cycle of forest growth. Fire, on the other hand, recycles nutrients on location (except for some nitrogen), it removes accumulated organic matter and it stimulates reproduction of fire-dependent species.Rowe, J. S. and G. W. Scotter. 1973. Fire in the boreal forest. Quaternary Research 3: 444‚Äì464.Heinselman, M. L. 1981. Fire and succession in the conifer forests of northern North America. pp. 374‚Äì405. In D. C. West, H.H. Shugart, and D. B. Botkin (eds.) Forest Succession: Concepts and Applications. New York: Springer-Verlag.True facterino Ecosystems Typical upland taiga in Quebec Canada's boreal region can be divided into seven ecozones. These seven can be divided into two main groups. The northern regions of the boreal forest consists of four eco-zones ‚Äì Taiga Cordillera, Taiga Plains, Taiga Shield and Hudson Plains ‚Äì that are the most thinly treed areas where the growing season and average tree size progressively shrinks until the edge of the Arctic tundra is reached.State of Canada's Forests: 2004-2005, p. 40. The southern tier of the boreal meanwhile consists of three other ecozones that form the largely uninterrupted or continuous forest in stretching as far south as Lake Superior in Ontario (as the Central Canadian Shield forests ecoregion) and the Manitoba-North Dakota border. These three southern zones are the Boreal Shield, at 1,630,000 square kilometres the largest of the eight zones, the Boreal Plains and Boreal Cordillera.State of Canada's Forests: 2004-2005, Map \\"Canada's Boreal Forest\\", inside back cover. A typical ecoregion of this southern tier would be the Eastern Canadian Shield taiga that covers northern Quebec and most of Labrador. Within the boreal region, there are about 1,890,000 square kilometres that are between 80% to 100% forested and another 650,000 square kilometres with 60% to 80% forest cover.State of Canada's Forests: 2004‚Äì2005, Map \\"Canada's Boreal Region\\", inside back cover Forest species The Calypso orchid grows in the shade of boreal forest. Most trees native to the Canadian boreal are conifers, with needle leaves and cones. These include: black spruce, white spruce, balsam fir, larch (tamarack), lodgepole pine, and jack pine. A few are broad-leaved species: trembling and large-toothed aspen, cottonwood and white birch, and balsam poplar.Archibold, O. W. 1995. Ecology of World Vegetation. London: Chapman and Hall. Chapter 8. There are large areas of black spruce, a species which is tolerant of shallow soil, permafrost and waterlogged substrates, although as a consequence they have relatively low biological productivity.C. Michael Hogan. 2008. Black Spruce: Picea mariana, GlobalTwitcher.com, ed. Nicklas Stromberg, November 2008 . Owing to the short growing season, generally infertile soils, generally shallow soils, and frequent waterlogging, most of these forest types are slow-growing species, which generally tend to predominate in stressed habitats.Keddy, P.A. 2007. Plants and Vegetation: Origins, Processes, Consequences. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. 666 p. Similarly, many of the understory shrubs are in the Ericaceae, a family known to tolerate acid, infertile and flooded habitats: examples include Labrador tea, sheep-laurel and blueberry. Since nutrient levels are so low, overall, the productivity of forest trees is highly dependent on the rate at which mineral elements such as nitrogen and phosphorus are recycled by litterfall and decomposition. After logging, the loss of nutrients may convert forested areas into shrub barrens dominated by shrubs such as sheep- laurel.Weetman, G. F. 1983. Forestry practices and stress on Canadian forest land. pp. 260‚Äì301. In W. Simpson-Lewis, R. McKechnie, and V. Neimanis (eds.) Stress on Land in Canada. Ottawa: Lands Directorate, Environment Canada. Many of the plant species are fire-dependent, since fire removes neighbouring plants, and recycles nutrients locked in organic matter. Although there are rather few species of trees in the boreal forest, there is a considerable diversity of other kinds of plants. An accurate summary is difficult, since most compendia on plants are organized by political, rather than ecological boundaries; one exception addresses the flora of the Hudson Bay Lowland,Riley, J.L. 2003. Flora of the Hudson Bay Lowland and its Postglacial Origins.NRC Research Press, Ottawa, Canada. 236 p. but much of this area is not forested. One portion of the boreal forest can be used to illustrate plant diversity; consider the Flora of the Yukon.Cody, W.J. 1996. Flora of the Yukon Territory. NRC Research Press, Ottawa, Canada. 643 p. In this western part of the boreal forest, there are, for example 127 species of grass (Poaceae), 118 species of Asteraceae, 115 species of sedge (Cyperaceae), 93 species of crucifer (Brassicaceae), 52 species of Rosaceae, 37 species of Saxifragaceae and 36 members of the snapdragon family (Scrophulariaceae). Overall, the flora has 1112 species ‚Äì there are even 15 species of orchids. A Sphagnum bog with spruce trees on a forested ridge in Quebec Inland water and wetlands Canada's boreal landscape contains more lakes and rivers than any comparably sized landmass on earth. It has been estimated that the boreal region contains over 1.5 million lakes with a minimum surface area of 40,000 square metres as well as some of Canada's largest lakes. Soft water lakes predominate in central and eastern Canada and hard water lakes predominate in Western Canada. Most large boreal lakes have cold water species of fish like trout and whitefish, while in warmer waters, species may include northern pike, walleye and smallmouth bass.\\"Boreal fresh waters\\", State of Canada's Forests 2004‚Äì2005, pp. 70‚Äì71 The boreal forest also has vast areas of wetland, particularly bogs and fens.National Wetlands Working Group. 1988. Wetlands of Canada.Jesse Graham Likes to party Canada Committee on Ecological Land Classification, Environment Canada. 452 p. Two wetland areas, the Hudson Bay Lowland and the Mackenzie River basin, are among the ten largest wetlands in the world.Fraser, L.H. and P.A. Keddy (eds.). 2005. The World's Largest Wetlands: Ecology and Conservation. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. The boreal forest wetlands provide wildlife habitat (particularly for migratory birds), they maintain water flow in rivers, and they store significant amounts of carbon that otherwise would be released to the atmosphere.Vitt, D.H., L.A. Halsey and B.J. Nicholson. 2005. The Mackenzie River basin. Pp. 166-202 in L.H. Fraser and P.A. Keddy (eds.). The World's Largest Wetlands: Ecology and Conservation. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. Deforestation Sheep laurel grows in clearings and shallow soils. It can form extensive shrub barrens after logging. In contemporary times, the boreal forest has suffered little deforestation, defined as the permanent conversion of forest area to non-forest due to activities associated with agriculture, urban or recreational development, oil and gas development, and flooding for hydroelectric projects. In Alberta, the province with the largest oil and gas industry, more trees are cut for agriculture or oil and gas exploration than for timber.State of Canada's Forests 2004-2005, p. 40 In eastern Canada, over 9,000 square kilometres of peatlands and forest have been flooded over the past four decades for hydroelectric projects. , Canada as a whole has 91% of the forest cover that existed at the dawn of European settlement. More deforestation has occurred outside the boreal region, in more southerly areas of the country. The forest sector annually harvests approximately ¬Ω of 1% of the region. However, this is not considered deforestation by some, given that provincial laws are meant to ensure that areas harvested by the forest sector are replanted or regenerated naturally. However, the resulting road network from logging has effects that persist long beyond the period of harvest; indeed, one can make the case that road construction is one of the most harmful and persistent effects of logging. The Canada warbler nests on the ground in boreal forests. Wildlife There may be as many as five billion landbirds, including resident and migratory species. The Canadian boreal region contains the largest area of wetlands of any ecosystem of the world, serving as breeding ground for over 12 million waterbirds and millions of land birds, the latter including species as diverse as vultures, hawks, grouse, owls, hummingbirds, kingfishers, woodpeckers and passerines (or perching birds, often referred to as songbirds).\\"Birds in Canada's Boreal Forest: New paradigms for paradise found\\", State of Canada's Forests 2005-2006, p. 72 It is estimated that the avian population of the boreal represents 60% of the landbirds in all of Canada and almost 30% of all landbirds in the United States and Canada combined.Peter Blancher, \\"Importance of Canada's Boreal Forest to Landbirds\\", Canadian Boreal Initiative and Boreal Songbird Initiative, May 2003, p. ii, Many of the wildlife species, are, like the forests, dependent upon natural disturbance from fire and insect outbreaks. For example, at least three species of warbler (Cape May warbler, bay-breasted warbler and Tennessee warbler), have distributions and abundance related to spruce budworm outbreaks.Cadman, M.D., P.F.J. Eagles, and F.M. Helleiner. Atlas of the Breeding Birds of Ontario. University of Waterloo Press, Waterloo. p. 376 The black-backed woodpecker shows a preference for burnt over forests, where it forages for insects burrowing in the dead trees that remain standing.Cadman, M.D., P.F.J. Eagles, and F.M. Helleiner. Atlas of the Breeding Birds of Ontario. University of Waterloo Press, Waterloo. p. 244 Fireweed, as the name suggests, is a plant that similar thrives in recently burned areas. Blueberries and huckleberries are also stimulated by fires, probably benefiting from the removal of shade, and the nutrients released in ashes. The resulting berries are an important food source for boreal forest animals. Few species of boreal wildlife are classified under government conservation regimes as being at risk of extinction. However, the decline of some major species of wildlife is a concern. Boreal woodland caribou, whose lichen-rich, mature forest habitat spans the boreal forest from the Northwest Territories to Labrador, is designated as a threatened by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada. The Newfoundland population of marten is threatened by habitat loss, accidental trapping and prey availability.\\"Forest Associated Species at Risk\\", State of Canada's Forests 2004‚Äì2005, pp. 77‚Äì79; http://www.newfoundlandmarten.com/page.php?pid=21  Boreal life cycles  Natural regeneration The particular mixture of tree species depends upon factors including soil moisture, soil depth, and organic content. Upland forests can be closely mixed with forested peatlands. The resulting conifer forests are produced by and dependent upon recurring disturbance from storms, fires, floods and insect outbreaks. Owing to the accumulated peat in the soil, and the predominance of coniferous trees, lightning-caused fire has always been a natural part of this forest. It is one of many ecosystems that depend upon such recurring natural disturbance.Keddy, P.A. 2007. Plants and Vegetation: Origins, Processes, Consequences. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. 666 p. For example, fire dependent species like lodgepole and jack pine have resin sealed cones. In a fire, the resin melts and the cones to open, allowing seeds to scatter so that a new pine forest begins (see also fire ecology). It has been estimated that prior to European settlement, this renewal process occurred on average every 75 to 100 years, creating even-aged stands of forest. Fire continues to cause natural forest disturbance,\\"Fire in the Forest\\", State of Canada's Forests, 2003‚Äì2004, p. 47 but fire suppression and clear-cutting has interrupted these natural cycles, leading to significant changes in species composition.Carleton, T. J. and P. MacLellan. 1994. Woody vegetation responses to fire versus clear- cutting logging: a comparative survey in the central Canadian boreal forest. Ecoscience 1: 141‚Äì152. Boreal vegetation never attains stability because of interactions among fire, vegetation, soil‚Äìwater relationships, frost action, and permafrost (Churchill and Hanson 1958, Spurr and Barnes 1980).Churchill, E.D.; Hanson, H.C. 1958.

Wildfires produce a vegetation mosaic supporting an ever-changing diversity of plant and animal populations (Viereck 1973).Viereck, L.A. 1973. Wildfire in the taiga of Alaska. Quaternary Res. 3:465‚Äì495. In the absence of fire, the accumulation of sphagnum peat on level upland sites would eventually oust coniferous vegetation and produce muskeg. Fire effects Fireweed is a native wildflower that grows after forest fires. Despite today's sophisticated and expensive fire-spotting and fire- fighting techniques, forest fires in Canada still burn, on average, about 28,000 square kilometres of boreal and other forest area annually. That average annual burn area is equivalent to more than three times the current annual industrial timber harvest. It can be many more times that in intense fire years.\\"Disturbances and Renewal in the Forest\\", State of Canada's Forests, 2003-2004, p. 74 However, although logging also removes trees, fire is not the same as logging, since fire has been a part of coniferous forests for millennia. Fire not only stimulates regeneration of many plant species, it recycles phosphorus and removes accumulated organic matter. Fire is increasingly used as a management tool to maintain forest health in some parts of North America (see fire ecology). Different parts of the boreal have different burn cycles. The drier western region, which receives lower average rainfall, had higher natural fire frequencies. Hence, more area is burned annually on average in the west than in central and eastern Canada.State of Canada's Forests 2003-2004, p. 69 When natural burn cycles are interrupted by fire suppression, natural renewal is obstructed and species composition is changed. In addition, fire suppression causes fuel loads to increase so that fires, when they do occur, become more intense. One can argue that fire suppression actually creates a positive feed back loop, where ever more expensive fire suppression generates the conditions for ever larger fires. The negative effects of fire suppression are still under study, and not fully measured, but they need to be considered when making decisions about the future health of boreal forests.  Economic activities  Region-wide planning Because parts of the boreal forest region are found in nearly every province and territory in Canada, there has not been much in the way of coordinated planning to develop the region. Prime Minister Diefenbaker talked of his \\"northern vision\\" but little was done to see it come to pass. A proposal was authored by Richard Rohmer in 1967 called Mid-Canada Development Corridor: A Concept and was discussed by officials and politicians but was never implemented. In 2014, John van Nostrand attempted to revive the concept.http://thewalrus.ca/if-we-build-it-they-will-stay/ In the absence of a nationwide plan, private industry and the provinces have pursued development in particular products or certain regions. These include the Athabasca Oil Sands in Alberta, the Ring of Fire (Ontario), and Quebec's Plan nord. Land ownership Forest land in Canada is largely Crown land. Over 90% of the boreal forest is provincial Crown land; another 5% is federally controlled and includes national parks, First Nations reserves and national defence installations.State of Canada's Forests 2004‚Äì2005, p. 49 Industrial activity A skidder is used to clear forest and move logs. About 1,400 communities within the Boreal region rely on resource industries for at least part of the livelihood and stability. Many of these communities were carved out of the forest to support a sawmill, pulp and paper mill, mine or railway maintenance facility. Boreal forestry activities support almost 400,000 direct and indirect jobs across Canada. Forestry, pulp and paper, mining, and oil and gas exploration and development are the largest industries along with tourism, trapping, recreation, light manufacturing and the services to support industry and communities. The forest products sector is one of Canada's largest export industries, representing approximately 3% of GDP, with about half of the annual wood harvest coming from the boreal forest.State of Canada's Forests 2004-2005, p. 57 Roughly one quarter of the boreal forest is managed for industrial forestry. The remaining three-quarters is either in parks, conservation areas, model forests or is considered non-timber-productive, generally defined as unsuitable for managed forestry or inaccessible. As recently as 2003, it was estimated that the annual harvest in the boreal was about 7,500 square kilometres per year, equivalent to about 0.2% of the total Canadian boreal forest.State of Canada's Forests 2004-2005, p. 48 The sharp downturn in the market for lumber because of the collapse of the housing market in the United States that began in 2006, coupled with import tariff and tax barriers, have knocked the bottom out of Canada's forest industry. In Ontario, Canada's most populous province, where most forestry activity is in the boreal, government statistics suggest that the harvest declined 18% from 2005 to 2006.Natural Resources Canada, statistical data, http://canadaforests.nrcan.gc.ca/statsprofile Given the high number of mill closings from 2005 onward, mostly in Ontario and Quebec, it is a trend that most likely persisted through 2007 and 2008.\\"Mill Closures and Mill Investments in the Canadian Forest Sector\\", State of Canada's Forests, 2005-2006, pp. 46-55. Most of Canada's conventional onshore oil and gas production, including the rapidly expanding oil sands production in Alberta, is located in the boreal region as is Canada's largest uranium producing zone in northern Saskatchewan and Quebec's largest hydroelectric generating facilities in the La Grande watershed. Indigenous participation About eighty percent of the Indigenous population of Canada resides in forested areas ‚Äì including one million in over five hundred First Nations and M√©tis settlements in boreal zones. Of that amount, over 17,000 work in the forest products industry, mostly in silviculture and woodlands operations in the boreal and other forest regions.\\"Aboriginal Partnerships in the Forest\\", State, The State of Canada's Forests, 2007, National Resources Canada, , p. 21; Canadian Boreal Initiative, Borealcanada.ca/boreal-did-you-know-e.php; \\"Aboriginal Issues in Canada's Boreal Forest\\", Summary, National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy. Sustainable development Since the early 1990s, a strong impetus has been created to focus on conserving Canada's boreal legacy and sustainably managing economic activity within the entire region. The Canadian boreal is largely intact and available for multiple uses like timber harvest, recreation and hunting. Forestry companies have come to adopt the management practices known as eco-system based management, which takes into consideration criteria and indicators for sustainability ‚Äì social, economic and environmental. A number of key principles have come to underpin Canadian forestry practices as mandated by forestry legislation, including the obligation for forestry companies operating on public lands to fully regenerate all areas harvested for timber and to consult the public on the preparation of forest management/harvest plans submitted to the relevant provincial authorities. Certification for sustainable forest management As a result of growing public concern with sustainable development and conserving the integrity of the boreal forests, conservation initiatives are progressing on various fronts. The area in national and provincial parks and protected conservation areas is approximately 10% of the total boreal area.\\"Sustainable Forest Management in Canada\\", State of Canada's Forests, 2007, p. 6 Most large forest products companies have certified their boreal forestry operations to one of three third-party, independently audited standards for sustainable forest management: *The Forest Stewardship Council's FSC Boreal Standard; *The Canadian standard CAN/CSA Z809; *The Sustainable Forestry Initiative. Sustainable Forest Management refers to managing a forest ecosystem in a manner that maintains and enhances its long-term health. Protection In July 2008 the Ontario government announced plans to protect 225,000 square kilometres of the Northern Boreal lands. In February 2010 the Canadian government established protection for of boreal forest by creating a new reserve of in the Mealy Mountains area of eastern Canada and a waterway provincial park of that follows alongside the Eagle River from headwaters to sea. A report issued in 2011 by the Pew Environment Group described the Canadian boreal forest as the largest natural storage of freshwater in the world.Pew Environment Group. A Forest of Blue: Canada's Boreal Forest. March 16, 2011  Boreal in culture and popular imagination  The boreal forest is deeply ingrained in the Canadian identity and the images foreigners have of Canada. The history of the early European fur traders, their adventures, discoveries, aboriginal alliances and misfortunes is an essential part of the popular colonial history of Canada. The canoe, the beaver pelt, the coureur des bois, the voyageurs, the Hudson's Bay Company and the North-West Mounted Police, the construction of Canada's transcontinental railways ‚Äì all are symbols of Canadian history familiar to school children that are inextricably linked to the boreal forest. The forest ‚Äì and boreal species such as the caribou and loon ‚Äì are or have been featured on Canadian currency. Another iconic and enduring image of the boreal was created by 20th-century landscape painters, most notably from the Group of Seven, who saw the uniqueness of Canada in its boreal vastness. The Group of Seven artists largely portrayed the boreal as natural, pure and unspoiled by human presence or activity and hence only partly a reflection of reality.\\"The boreal muse of the Group of Seven; Creating a national identity from a palette of boreal colours\\", Canadian Geographic, Jan/Feb 2004, See also *Environment of Canada *La Saline Natural Area References  Citations  * * External links *Map of Canadian Ecozones. *The Alberta Centre for Boreal Studies *Boreal Songbird Initiative *Map of world's largest wetlands.

Developed by John Maynard Smith as a model for chick begging behavior, it has been studied extensively including the development of many modified versions. It was named after a story about Philip Sidney who allegedly, fatally wounded, gave his water to another, saying, \\"thy necessity is yet greater than mine.\\"  The phenomenon  Young birds and other animals beg for food from their parents. It appears that in many species the intensity of begging varies with the need of the chick and that parents give more food to those chicks that beg more. Since parents respond differentially, chicks have an incentive to overstate their need since it will result in them receiving more food. If all chicks overstate their need, parents have an incentive to ignore the begging and give food using some other rule. This situation represents a case of animal signaling where there arises an evolutionary question to explain the maintenance of the signal. The Sir Philip Sidney game formalizes a signalling theory suggestion from Amotz Zahavi, the handicap principle, that reliability is maintained by making the signal costly to produce‚Äîchicks expend energy in begging. Since it requires energy to beg, only chicks in dire need should be willing to expend the energy to secure food.  The game  There are two individuals, the signaler and the responder. The responder has some good which can be transferred to the signaler or not. If the responder keeps the good, the responder has a fitness of 1, otherwise the responder has a fitness of (1-d). The signaler can be in one of two states, healthy or needy. If the signaler receives the good, his fitness will be 1. Otherwise his fitness will be (1-b) or (1-a) if healthy or needy respectively (where a>b). The signaler can send a signal or not. If he sends the signal he incurs a cost of c regardless of the outcome. If individuals maximize their own fitness the responder should never transfer the good, since he is reducing his own fitness for no gain. However, it supposed that the signaler and responder are related by some degree r. Each individual attempts to maximize his inclusive fitness, and so in some cases the responder would like to transfer the good. The case of interest is where the responder only wants to transfer the good to the needy signaler, but the signaler would want the good regardless of his state. This creates a partial conflict of interest, where there would be an incentive for deception. Maynard Smith showed, however, that for certain values of c, honest signaling can be an evolutionarily stable strategy. This suggests that it might be sustained by evolution. Criticisms The empirical study of chick begging has cast some doubt on the appropriateness of the Sir Philip Sidney game and on the handicap principle as an explanation for chick begging behavior. Several empirical studies have attempted to measure the cost of begging, in effect measuring c. These studies have found that although there is a cost, it is far lower than would be sufficient to sustain honesty. Since the actual benefits of food are hard to calculate, the required value of c cannot be determined exactly, but it nonetheless has raised concern. In addition to the empirical concern, there has been theoretical concern. In a series of papers, Carl Bergstrom and Michael Lachmann suggest that in many biologically possible cases we should not expect to find signaling despite the fact that it is an evolutionarily stable strategy. They point out that whenever a signaling strategy is evolutionarily stable, non-signaling equilibria are as well. As a result, evolutionary stability alone does not require the evolution of signaling. In addition, they note that in many of these cases the signaling equilibrium is pareto inferior to the non-signaling one ‚Äì both the chick and parent are worse off than if there was no signaling. Since one would expect non-signalling to be the ancestral state, it is unclear how evolution would move a population from a superior equilibrium to an inferior one. Both of these concerns led Bergstrom and Lachmann to suggest a modified game where honesty is maintained, not by signal cost, but instead by the common interest inherent in interaction among relatives. In their partial pooling model, individuals have no incentive to lie, because the lie would harm their relative proportionally more than it would help them. As a result, they do better by remaining honest.

The engine was intended to power the TVR Griffith and the TVR Chimaera but delays in its production meant that it powered only the TVR Cerbera and the TVR Tuscan Racer. The reason behind the engine's development and production was that in that particular time Rover was bought by BMW and Peter Wheeler the boss of TVR in that time, feared that BMW would drop the Rover V8 engine used in TVRs since the early 80's, so he contracted car engine designer Al Melling to design a brand-new V8 engine to power the TVR Cerbera as well as an engine that TVR could sell to other car manufacturers. The engine itself was designed by engine guru Al Melling along with John Ravenscroft and the then boss of TVR Peter Wheeler. Its production codename was \\"AJP8\\" (A=Al, J=John, P=Peter), with this naming convention being subsequently used by the Speed Six engine's \\"AJP6\\" codename. The Speed Eight featured many aspects found in a racing engine, such as a flat plane crankshaft, a 75-degree Vee angle, a SOHC arrangement operating two valves per cylinder and sequential fuel injection. There were two versions of the Speed Eight engine, one displacing 4.2L and producing , and the other displacing 4.5L and producing . Beyond that, a Red Rose conversion was made available that increased output to when using fuel with a minimum octane rating of 97 RON. The Red Rose upgrade included reshaped intake and exhaust ports, higher compression, and an ECU that can be switched between two sets of fueling and ignition maps (for 95 RON and 97 RON fuel, respectively). The Speed Eight engine has a high specific output for a normally aspirated engine with 83.3 bhp/L for the 4.2L, 93.3 bhp/L for the 4.5L, and 97.7 bhp/L for the Red Rose- specification 4.5L engine. Another notable aspect is the weight of the engine, which is dry. Even though the engine was a strong seller in the Speed Eight Cerbera, TVR dropped it when they stopped production of the Cerbera in 2003. (A special anniversary Cerbera made in 2006 to celebrate the car used the 4.5L version of the engine.) In recent news though, Al Melling is planning to produce a new sports car called the Melling Wildcat which will be powered by an improved 4.7 litre version of the AJP8.

On the album, Flynn is backed by his band the Sussex Wit.  Background  The title of the album is the Middle English word for \\"alarm,\\" used in Shakespeare's stage directions to signify a disturbance occurring offstage, and Flynn \\"quite liked the idea that the noise happening offstage was this album\\". The record was recorded at a studio called Bear Creek near Seattle. In a 2010 interview, Flynn said of the studio, \\"The only thing around was a coffee stand where the girls wore bikinis. It was on a main road through the woods, in the middle of nowhere. That made us feel very English.\\" Reception In her review for Allmusic, critic Katherine Fullton wrote \\"it quickly becomes clear that the Wit's intricate, meandering rhythms and melodies are a fitting complement to Flynn's straightforward delivery, augmenting lyrics that would also function as poetry outside of a musical setting... The tangible intimacy between Flynn and his group makes A Larum not only an introduction, but also captures the gentle, amicable nature that makes them such an inviting and satisfying listen.\\" Peter Hayward of MusicOMH called the album \\"a marvellously accomplished and endearing debut that, while rooted in tradition and most easily described as folk, should have broader appeal beyond the beardy-weirdy set.\\" Writing for Rolling Stone, David Fricke named A Larum as one of \\"Fricke's Picks\\", calling it a \\"dramatic entrance\\" for Flynn and his band, drawing allusions between Flynn and earlier folk artists such as Fairport Convention and Bert Jansch. The song \\"Tickle Me Pink\\" was featured as iTunes free single of the week.

It explores how digital piracy and cultural appropriation within art and popular culture by Internet users influences cultural reproduction within capitalism. It was a Canadian Governor-General‚Äôs Award finalist in the category of non-fiction in 2006.http://www.canadacouncil.ca/prizes/ggla/2006/ig128053119096301686.htm Overview According to Strangelove, the economic system known as capitalism promotes unequal class, race and gender relations. Thus capitalism invariably produces resistance. This resistance takes the form of a contest over the meaning of things and events. Structural changes in the architecture of communication lead to new forms and strategies of resistance. The Empire of Mind identifies characteristics of these structural changes and outlines their implications for resistance to capitalism‚Äôs definitional control over meaning. The Empire of Mind describes a theory of cultural transmission that takes into account a new structure of communication that is not found in the corporate (commercial) media systems of the pre-Internet era. Within this theory of cultural transmission the notion of an empire of mind is used to describe how capitalism operates as 'a violent and controlling system' (p. 10) that \\"tends toward totalization, embracing all before it within its homogenizing logic of social organization\\" (p. 12). While Strangelove describes capitalism as having a tendency towards totalization he also argues that such forces as consumer resistance and competition between corporations has ensured that capitalism has never achieved total control over individuals. The Empire of Mind includes an analysis of culture jamming which provides an example of how Internet-based cultural production subverts dominant symbolic economies and ideologies and paves the way for the emergence of new symbolic economies (belief systems). Culture jamming is presented as one example of the Internet audience's tendency to subvert privately owned meanings. Strangelove makes no claims about the overall potency or potential of culture jamming. Neither does he claim that the Internet heralds the envitable destruction of capitalism. While Strangelove does argue that the Internet is part of a new symbolic economy he makes no predictions as to the future state (dystopic or utopic) of capitalism's belief system. Strangelove provides a scholarly definition of the term empire of mind and applies it within an analysis of new and old media. Given the premise that capitalism operates as a meaning-production system that exercises substantial control over our cultures and minds‚Äîan empire of mind --- the Internet is seen as subverting the dominant flow of meaning within capitalism's symbolic empire.  Related uses of the term \\"Empire of (the) Mind\\"  The notion of an \\"empire of mind\\" (usually seen expressed as an \\"empire of the mind\\") has been found in literature since Alexis De Tocqueville first used it in the following oft quoted passage: > I consider the people of the United States as that portion of the English > people which is commissioned to explore the wilds of the New World; whilst > the rest of the nation, enjoying more leisure and less harassed by the > drudgery of life, may devote its energies to thought, and enlarge in all > directions the empire of the mind. The position of the Americans is > therefore quite exceptional, and it may be believed that no democratic > people will ever be placed in a similar one.Alexis De Tocqueville, Democracy > In America. The phrase an \\"empire of the mind\\" usually denotes imperialism or a specific empire and has been applied to the United States, Britain, India, Iran and ancient Greece. Strangelove's use of the phrase was inspired by Sir Winston Churchill's statement, \\"The empires of the future are the empires of the mind.\\"Winston Churchill, Speech at Harvard University, September 6, 1943. Commentary on the thesis of The Empire of Mind Howard A. Doughty writes that Strangelove \\"seems to have achieved a position of sensible moderation, an attitude toward the driving force of postmodern culture that allows it to be redeemed, rather than replaced. He embraces the liberal virtues of humanistic reformism. While supporting an attack on authoritarianism, sexism and fast food through new communications techniques, he avoids the logocentrism and the allegedly false promises of nineteenth and twentieth-century revolutionary thinkers.\\"Howard A. Doughty, \\"Review of The Empire of Mind: Digital Piracy and the Anti-Capitalist Movement\\", College Quarterly, Spring 2007, vol. 10, issue 2. According to Christopher Moore, Strangelove \\"believes the fundamental empire today is capitalism‚Äôs. It operates, he argues, not just through state systems and the marketplace, but by propagating an empire of the mind that takes capitalism for granted. Capitalism is a meaning-production system, he declares ... The goal of capitalism‚Äôs empire is the commodification of everything.\\"Christopher Moore, The Creators' Copyright Coalition, \\"Book Review: Strangelove‚Äôs Empire\\", 4 November 2006.  Summary of academic reviews  A review of this book by Darren Wershler-Henry in the Canadian Journal of Communication states, \\"There is also an inconsistency between Strangelove‚Äôs criteria for a useful model of the Internet and that for his model of capitalism. \\"Within critical theory,\\" writes Strangelove, \\"philosophical and economic enquiry tends to recreate the Internet in the image of the twentieth century\\" (p. 98). Fair enough, but why does Strangelove rely on a model of capitalism that is every bit as dated?\\"Darren Wershler-Henry, \\"Review of The Empire of Mind: Digital Piracy and the Anti-Capitalist Movement\\", Canadian Journal of Communication, 2008, volume 33, issue 1. A review of this book by Tarleton Gillespie in New Media and Society notes that \\"Strangelove is working very much from within a Marxist, critical theory of communication and society\\" and questions Strangelove's claim that \\"the file-trading of commercial music and film, which he sees as a widespread disregard for the principle of property, is not an aberration, but is in fact the resting state of the Internet.\\"Tarleton Gillespie, New Media and Society, volume 9, issue 3, p. 551. A review in Canadian Literature: A Quarterly of Criticism and Review, by Michael Truscello, notes that Strangelove \\"is quick to point out, repeatedly, that he is not projecting utopian ends for Internet communication; rather, his \\"concern\\" is with what he calls \\"embryonic dynamics,\\" emergent possibilities that may not realize a transformation of the social order for some time. In essence, \\"by simply allowing all voices a forum, the Internet subverts the hegemonic construction of reality.\\" Hegemonic appeals are unsustainable in an environment of \\"unconstrained communicative action,\\" he suggests, and this is \\"the heart of the Internet's most probable long-term social effect.\\"Michael Truscello, \\"Review of The Empire of Mind: Digital Piracy and the Anti- Capitalist Movement\\", Canadian Literature: A Quarterly of Criticism and Review, Winter 2007, volume 195. A review in The Communication Review by Scott Uzelman notes that the \\"empire of mind\\" as defined by Strangelove \\"standardizes beliefs and wants that are \\"engineered\\" or \\"programmed\\" by capitalism and \\"constructed through the corporate media which acts as a propaganda tool for the elite.\\"\\" Yet the reviewer contends that \\"'capitalism is not reducible to a belief system\\".Scott Uzelman, \\"Book Review: Exploring Possibilities for Mediated Resistance\\", The Communication Review, 2006, volume 9, pp. 155-162. A review in Politics and Culture, by Alex Kashnabish, describes The Empire of Mind as a book that \\"challenges the prevailing assumptions surrounding the Internet and its possibilities\\". Kashnabish writes that this book \\"is at its strongest and most convincing when taking up the analysis of the Internet and its relationship to capitalism‚Äôs symbolic economy as well as in regards to the significant ‚Äì if not insurmountable ‚Äì challenges involved in enclosing the Internet and turning it into fully corporatized space. In both these respects, Strangelove‚Äôs argument is nuanced and persuasive.\\"Alex Kashnabish, \\"Symbolic Subversion: Review of Michael Strangelove, The Empire of the Mind; Digital Piracy and the Anti-Capitalist Movement\\" , Politics and Culture, (2008) Issue #2.

His Endliche Gruppen (finite groups) is an influential textbook in group theory, and he has over 50 doctoral descendants. Life Education Bertram Huppert went to school in Bonn from 1934 until 1945. In 1950, he wrote his diploma thesis in mathematics at the University of Mainz. The thesis discussed \\"nicht fortsetzbare Potenzreihen\\" (discontinuous power series), and was written under the direction of Helmut Wielandt. When Wielandt moved to the University of T√ºbingen in April 1951, Huppert followed him later in the year, and gained his doctorate (as Wielandt's first doctoral student) with the work \\"Produkte von paarweise vertauschbaren zyklischen Gruppen\\" (products of pairwise permutable cyclic groups), in which he showed, among other things, that such groups were supersoluble. This was the first of more than forty further scientific works, not including his books and monographs. The focus of the dissertation was very close to Wielandt's interests at the time, whose 1951 work shows that the product of pairwise permutable nilpotent groups is solvable. Academic career Huppert spent the years 1963/64 as a visiting professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena. In January 1965, he became a professor of pure mathematics at the University of Mainz, where he later became a professor emeritus in 1994. He put a lot of effort into building up the Mainz group theory and abstract algebra research groups. Following an assignment, he wrote a monumental standard text in the theory of finite groups, Endliche Gruppen I. The group around Wolfgang Gasch√ºtz in Kiel provided important contributions in discussions to that volume. Volumes II and III appeared 14 years later in English with co-author Norman Blackburn. In 1984, Huppert founded, together with Gerhard Michler, the first Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft priority programme in Mathematics at the German universities of Aachen, Bielefeld, Essen and Mainz. From 1964 to 1985, Huppert was a member of the editorial board of the Journal of Algebra. Together with Wolfgang Gasch√ºtz and Karl W. Gruenberg, he organised Oberwolfach workshops on group theory over many years, and with Michler the Oberwolfach workshop on representation theory. He was a founding member of the Institute of Experimental Mathematics of the University of Essen and is a member of the Akademie gemeinn√ºtziger Wissenschaften zu Erfurt.

American Religious Identification Survey (ARIS) Previously named the National Survey of Religious Identification in 1990, it was renamed the American Religious Identification Survey (ARIS) in 2001. The survey was originally created as a social experiment to record the response to the \\"What is your religion?\\" question. They found it was necessary to ask a series of questions such as \\"Do you want to have a religious funeral?\\" in order to get a better grasp of the answer to the main question. The 2001 survey intended to replicate the 1990 survey. Data was collected from over 50,000 households over a 4-month period. In 2008 the ARIS again randomly called over 50,000 households and questioned adults about their religious affiliations, if any.

The successor organization is the Jewish Child Care Association. Henry Fernbach designed the asylum building on 77th Street near Third Avenue. The Brooklyn Hebrew Orphan Asylum was constructed in Brooklyn, New York. In 1884 the Hebrew Benevolent Society constructed a large orphanage building at Amsterdam Avenue between 136th and 138th Streets. It was designed by William H.

In 1878, the organization, overwhelmed, agreed to accept only Manhattan children. This led to the formation of the Hebrew Orphan Asylum of the City of Brooklyn. Between 1860 and 1919, some 13,500 children were admitted to the home. Few children, however, were adopted, since most were actually half-orphans, members of a family which one parent (usually the father) had deserted and which the surviving parent could not support. The asylum was used, in effect, as a boarding school.Bogen, Hyman. The Luckiest Orphans: A History of the Hebrew Orphan Asylum of New York City.

It was self-sufficient enough that it was able to survive for a week on its own after it was cut off during the Blizzard of 1888. After a dysentery outbreak in 1898, caused by impurities in the city's water supply, left seven children dead, the building installed its own water filtration system.

Within two years the orphanage population in the city shrank by 3,000 children as women became able to care for their children. By 1920 the orphanage was losing its position to the Pleasantville Cottage School (established 1912), which, unlike the Hebrew Orphan Asylum, was not a large institutional building but a group of cottages in a rural area. The Hebrew Orphan Asylum decided to rebuild on the cottage system on land that it owned in the Bronx; it would raise money to do this by selling the orphanage to the Yankees, who wanted land to build a rival stadium to the Polo Grounds. This deal fell through, the Yankees instead built a stadium in the Bronx, and the Hebrew Orphan Asylum closed in 1941.van Alkemade, Kim.

Early life Shropshire was born in New Orleans, Louisiana in 1877. While living in Jackson, Mississippi, he briefly attended Mississippi A&M;, Millsaps College, and Ward's Business College. After moving to Franklin, Tennessee, to avoid an outbreak of yellow fever, he took a job as an assistant for a local doctor. This experience led him to enroll in the medical school of the University of Tennessee in Nashville. After graduating in 1900, Shropshire began to practice in several small towns. He moved to Birmingham, Alabama in 1903. He completed post-graduate studies at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and the Mayo Clinic. Shropshire also served as the United States Public Health Service representative for Birmingham and the president of the Jefferson County Medical Society. Founding of Civitan International Shropshire was attending a newly organized Rotary club in 1917. He and several of the other Rotarians decided that the club was too focused on increasing the business of its members. They surrendered their Rotary charter and formed an independent service club focused on serving the community and meeting the needs of individuals that could be served person to person, rather than business for business. By serving and creating a healthy-whole community, the businesses would naturally thrive. They held their first meeting on March 17, 1917, with 37 charter members. Shropshire and Eddie Cantor promoting blood donation in 1952.They named the group the \\"Civitan Club.\\" Shropshire was elected president for two successive terms as the club grew to 200 members. He envisioned an international organization of clubs, but the nation's focus on World War I prevented the club from becoming anything more than a local club. With businessmen in other cities asking to form clubs, the International Association of Civitan Clubs was established in 1920; it would later become Civitan International. Shropshire was elected as the first international president for two years in a row; he remains the only individual to serve two terms as international president. After his terms ended, Shropshire continued to actively promote Civitan.

They are used to describe the behavior of charged particles in a Coulomb potential and can be written in terms of confluent hypergeometric functions or Whittaker functions of imaginary argument. Coulomb wave equation The Coulomb wave equation for a single charged particle of mass m is the Schr√∂dinger equation with Coulomb potential :\\\\left(-\\\\hbar^2\\\\frac{ abla^2}{2m}+\\\\frac{Z \\\\hbar c \\\\alpha}{r}\\\\right) \\\\psi_{\\\\vec{k}}(\\\\vec{r}) = \\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2k^2}{2m} \\\\psi_{\\\\vec{k}}(\\\\vec{r}) \\\\,, where Z=Z_1 Z_2 is the product of the charges of the particle and of the field source (in units of the elementary charge, Z=-1 for the hydrogen atom), \\\\alpha is the fine-structure constant, and \\\\hbar^2k^2/(2m) is the energy of the particle. The solution ‚Äì Coulomb wave function ‚Äì can be found by solving this equation in parabolic coordinates :\\\\xi= r + \\\\vec{r}\\\\cdot\\\\hat{k}, \\\\quad \\\\zeta= r - \\\\vec{r}\\\\cdot\\\\hat{k} \\\\qquad (\\\\hat{k} = \\\\vec{k}/k) \\\\,. Depending on the boundary conditions chosen, the solution has different forms. Two of the solutions are :\\\\psi_{\\\\vec{k}}^{(\\\\pm)}(\\\\vec{r}) = \\\\Gamma(1\\\\pm i\\\\eta) e^{-\\\\pi\\\\eta/2} e^{i\\\\vec{k}\\\\cdot\\\\vec{r}} M(\\\\mp i\\\\eta, 1, \\\\pm ikr - i\\\\vec{k}\\\\cdot\\\\vec{r}) \\\\,, where M(a,b,z) \\\\equiv {}_1\\\\\\\\!F_1(a;b;z) is the confluent hypergeometric function, \\\\eta = Zmc\\\\alpha/(\\\\hbar k) and \\\\Gamma(z) is the gamma function. The two boundary conditions used here are :\\\\psi_{\\\\vec{k}}^{(\\\\pm)}(\\\\vec{r}) \\\\rightarrow e^{i\\\\vec{k}\\\\cdot\\\\vec{r}} \\\\qquad (\\\\vec{k}\\\\cdot\\\\vec{r} \\\\rightarrow \\\\pm\\\\infty) \\\\,, which correspond to \\\\vec{k}-oriented plane-wave asymptotic states before or after its approach of the field source at the origin, respectively. The functions \\\\psi_{\\\\vec{k}}^{(\\\\pm)} are related to each other by the formula :\\\\psi_{\\\\vec{k}}^{(+)} = \\\\psi_{-\\\\vec{k}}^{(-)*} \\\\,.  Partial wave expansion  The wave function \\\\psi_{\\\\vec{k}}(\\\\vec{r}) can be expanded into partial waves (i.e. with respect to the angular basis) to obtain angle-independent radial functions w_\\\\ell(\\\\eta,\\\\rho). Here \\\\rho=kr. :\\\\psi_{\\\\vec{k}}(\\\\vec{r}) = \\\\frac{4\\\\pi}{r} \\\\sum_{\\\\ell=0}^\\\\infty \\\\sum_{m=-\\\\ell}^\\\\ell i^\\\\ell w_{\\\\ell}(\\\\eta,\\\\rho) Y_\\\\ell^m (\\\\hat{r}) Y_{\\\\ell}^{m\\\\ast} (\\\\hat{k}) \\\\,. A single term of the expansion can be isolated by the scalar product with a specific spherical harmonic :\\\\psi_{k\\\\ell m}(\\\\vec{r}) = \\\\int \\\\psi_{\\\\vec{k}}(\\\\vec{r}) Y_\\\\ell^m (\\\\hat{k}) d\\\\hat{k} = R_{k\\\\ell}(r) Y_\\\\ell^m(\\\\hat{r}), \\\\qquad R_{k\\\\ell}(r) = 4\\\\pi i^\\\\ell w_\\\\ell(\\\\eta,\\\\rho)/r. The equation for single partial wave w_\\\\ell(\\\\eta,\\\\rho) can be obtained by rewriting the laplacian in the Coulomb wave equation in spherical coordinates and projecting the equation on a specific spherical harmonic Y_\\\\ell^m(\\\\hat{r}) :\\\\frac{d^2 w_\\\\ell}{d\\\\rho^2}+\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{2\\\\eta}{\\\\rho}-\\\\frac{\\\\ell(\\\\ell+1)}{\\\\rho^2}\\\\right)w_\\\\ell=0 \\\\,. The solutions are also called Coulomb (partial) wave functions or spherical Coulomb functions. Putting z=-2i\\\\rho changes the Coulomb wave equation into the Whittaker equation, so Coulomb wave functions can be expressed in terms of Whittaker functions with imaginary arguments M_{-i\\\\eta,\\\\ell+1/2}(-2i\\\\rho) and W_{-i\\\\eta,\\\\ell+1/2}(-2i\\\\rho). The latter can be expressed in terms of the confluent hypergeometric functions M and U. One defines the special solutions :H_\\\\ell^{(\\\\pm)}(\\\\eta,\\\\rho) = \\\\mp 2i(-2)^{\\\\ell}e^{\\\\pi\\\\eta/2} e^{\\\\pm i \\\\sigma_\\\\ell}\\\\rho^{\\\\ell+1}e^{\\\\pm i\\\\rho}U(\\\\ell+1\\\\pm i\\\\eta,2\\\\ell+2,\\\\mp 2i\\\\rho) \\\\,, where :\\\\sigma_\\\\ell = \\\\arg \\\\Gamma(l+1+i \\\\eta) is called the Coulomb phase shift. One also defines the real functions :F_\\\\ell(\\\\eta,\\\\rho) = \\\\frac{1}{2i} \\\\left(H_\\\\ell^{(+)}(\\\\eta,\\\\rho)-H_\\\\ell^{(-)}(\\\\eta,\\\\rho) \\\\right) \\\\,, :G_\\\\ell(\\\\eta,\\\\rho) = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left(H_\\\\ell^{(+)}(\\\\eta,\\\\rho)+H_\\\\ell^{(-)}(\\\\eta,\\\\rho) \\\\right) \\\\,. In particular one has :F_\\\\ell(\\\\eta,\\\\rho) = \\\\frac{2^\\\\ell e^{-\\\\pi\\\\eta/2}\\\\Gamma(\\\\ell+1+i\\\\eta)}{(2\\\\ell+1)!}\\\\rho^{\\\\ell+1}e^{i\\\\rho}M(\\\\ell+1+i\\\\eta,2\\\\ell+2,-2i\\\\rho) \\\\,. The asymptotic behavior of the spherical Coulomb functions H_\\\\ell^{(\\\\pm)}(\\\\eta,\\\\rho), F_\\\\ell(\\\\eta,\\\\rho), and G_\\\\ell(\\\\eta,\\\\rho) at large \\\\rho is :H_\\\\ell^{(\\\\pm)}(\\\\eta,\\\\rho) \\\\sim e^{\\\\pm i \\\\theta_\\\\ell(\\\\rho)} \\\\,, :F_\\\\ell(\\\\eta,\\\\rho) \\\\sim \\\\sin \\\\theta_\\\\ell(\\\\rho) \\\\,, :G_\\\\ell(\\\\eta,\\\\rho) \\\\sim \\\\cos \\\\theta_\\\\ell(\\\\rho) \\\\,, where :\\\\theta_\\\\ell(\\\\rho) = \\\\rho - \\\\eta \\\\log(2\\\\rho) -\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\ell \\\\pi + \\\\sigma_\\\\ell \\\\,. The solutions H_\\\\ell^{(\\\\pm)}(\\\\eta,\\\\rho) correspond to incoming and outgoing spherical waves. The solutions F_\\\\ell(\\\\eta,\\\\rho) and G_\\\\ell(\\\\eta,\\\\rho) are real and are called the regular and irregular Coulomb wave functions. In particular one has the following partial wave expansion for the wave function \\\\psi_{\\\\vec{k}}^{(+)}(\\\\vec{r}) :\\\\psi_{\\\\vec{k}}^{(+)}(\\\\vec{r}) = \\\\frac{4\\\\pi}{\\\\rho} \\\\sum_{\\\\ell=0}^\\\\infty \\\\sum_{m=-\\\\ell}^\\\\ell i^\\\\ell e^{i \\\\sigma_\\\\ell} F_\\\\ell(\\\\eta,\\\\rho) Y_\\\\ell^m (\\\\hat{r}) Y_{\\\\ell}^{m\\\\ast} (\\\\hat{k}) \\\\,,  Properties of the Coulomb function  The radial parts for a given angular momentum are orthonormal. When normalized on the wave number scale (k-scale), the continuum radial wave functions satisfy {Citationfirst=Ji≈ô√≠last=Form√°nektitle=Introduction to quantum theory Ipublisher=Academialocation=Pragueyear=2004edition=2ndlanguage=Czechpages=128‚Äì130}} :\\\\int_0^\\\\infty R_{k\\\\ell}^\\\\ast(r) R_{k'\\\\ell}(r) r^2 dr = \\\\delta(k-k') Other common normalizations of continuum wave functions are on the reduced wave number scale (k/2\\\\pi-scale), :\\\\int_0^\\\\infty R_{k\\\\ell}^\\\\ast(r) R_{k'\\\\ell}(r) r^2 dr = 2\\\\pi \\\\delta(k-k') \\\\,, and on the energy scale :\\\\int_0^\\\\infty R_{E\\\\ell}^\\\\ast(r) R_{E'\\\\ell}(r) r^2 dr = \\\\delta(E-E') \\\\,. The radial wave functions defined in the previous section are normalized to :\\\\int_0^\\\\infty R_{k\\\\ell}^\\\\ast(r) R_{k'\\\\ell}(r) r^2 dr = \\\\frac{(2\\\\pi)^3}{k^2} \\\\delta(k-k') as a consequence of the normalization :\\\\int \\\\psi^{\\\\ast}_{\\\\vec{k}}(\\\\vec{r}) \\\\psi_{\\\\vec{k}'}(\\\\vec{r}) d^3r = (2\\\\pi)^3 \\\\delta(\\\\vec{k}-\\\\vec{k}') \\\\,. The continuum (or scattering) Coulomb wave functions are also orthogonal to all Coulomb bound states :\\\\int_0^\\\\infty R_{k\\\\ell}^\\\\ast(r) R_{n\\\\ell}(r) r^2 dr = 0 due to being eigenstates of the same hermitian operator (the hamiltonian) with different eigenvalues.

In 1862, five years before Confederation, \\"drill associations\\" were set up in Canada as a response to the Fenian Raids and the American Civil War. These early drill associations served to train militia and were open to people over the age of 13. In 1879, the government authorized the creation of 74 \\"Association[s] for Drill in Educational Institutions\\", drill associations that were open to male youth over the age of 14 and which did not entail active service in the military. The Riel Rebellion of 1885 motivated increased support to these youth drill associations. By 1887, they were called the cadet corps and were open to boys over the age of 12. It was not until July 30, 1970 (the result of a change in legislation) that girls were officially permitted to join Government supported cadet corps and squadrons. Until then, girls paraded as \\"Wrennettes\\" supported by the Navy League and Air \\"Cadettes\\" supported by the Air Cadet League. On rare occasions, girls paraded unofficially with army cadets.

The bands are primarily staffed by cadets from their respective organizations. The music program of Cadet Canada supports only three types of marching bands: military bands, bugle bands, and pipe bands. The drum major of these bands use a different command style from their counterparts in the CF, with different commands including countermarch and marktime.

He was associated with the Regionalist art movement. Early life Frederic James was born in Kansas City, Missouri in 1915. His father was master of the Santa Fe Railroad yards. James showed an early talent for painting, and in 1934, the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City accepted one of his watercolors for their Midwestern Exhibition. James attended the University of Michigan and majored in architecture. Upon his graduation, he was awarded an architecture scholarship to the Cranbrook Academy of Art, where he was close friends with Eero Saarinen, Ralph Rapson, and Charles and Ray Eames. Working in a partnership with Saarinen and Rapson, he won a national competition, sponsored by the Museum of Modern Art, to design a national theater in Williamsburg, Virginia, beating out, among others, Philip S. Goodwin and Edward Durrell Stone. Despite his talent, architecture was not James' passion, and the only building he ever designed and built was his home in Kansas City. Art career In 1939, he returned to Kansas City and dedicated himself to becoming a painter. That year, he won the watercolor prize competition at the Kansas City Art Institute. His career quickly gained momentum. In 1940, he had a piece accepted for the International Exhibition of Watercolors at the Art Institute of Chicago and won the Friends of Art Purchase Prize in the Midwestern Artists Exhibition of the Kansas City Art Institute. The Art Institute immediately hired him to teach watercolor classes, and James began a close association with fellow teacher and famed Regionalist artist Thomas Hart Benton. Benton selected 15 of James‚Äô watercolors to be included in a widely publicized exhibition of his students‚Äô work that was held at the Associated American Artists Gallery in New York City in November 1940. James‚Äô art career was put on hold by World War II. He enlisted and was assigned first to Fort Leonard Wood and later to Brazil, never seeing the European or Pacific Theaters of War. Following the war, James returned to Kansas City and resumed his painting and teaching career at the Art Institute. In 1947, he married Diana Hearne. James had vacationed at Martha's Vineyard with Benton‚Äôs family for a few years, and James soon purchased a second home on Martha's Vineyard as well. He also gave up his teaching position to concentrate on painting, and his reputation continued to expand, winning the Purchase Award at the Mid-America Annual Art Show in 1951 and holding a well-received one-man show at the Associated American Artists Gallery in New York in 1952. In 1954, the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art held an exhibition of his work in their main loan gallery. After the mid-1950s, James lost interest in promoting his work on a national stage, but he continued his prolific output, producing many watercolors of rural Missouri and Kansas, especially the Flint Hills of Kansas. In addition to his watercolors, James did murals for the Trinity Lutheran Church in Mission, Kansas; the Overland Park State Bank, and the Kansas and Consumer's Coop Association. He also completed a wild flower series of prints of the New York Botanical Garden. He died in 1985. References Sources * Frederic James: A Painter from Kansas City.

Construction of the jail began in 1840. It is built from limestone from the quarry at Longford on the east side of Lake Couchiching. Five prisoners were hanged at this location: James Carruthers age 48 on 11 June 1873 for the murder of his wife; John Tryon age 47, on Dec 30, 1873 for the murder of Francis Fisher; George O'Neil, 47 years, on Jan 4, 1929, for the murders of Azor Robertson and Ruby Irene Martin; Thomas Wesley Campbell, age 54, on Jan 4, 1932, for the murder of William Campbell, his father; Lloyd Wellington Simcoe, age 18 in 1945 for murder. Others died during incarceration and are believed to be buried in the inner courtyard.

It is included as a subspecies in R. socotranus by some authorities, but in recent times the three golden-winged grosbeak populations are usually considered distinct species.Kirwan & Grieve (2007) Description The males are grey-brown overall with a black bill. The head is brown, with a dark grey mask and white cheeks, and it has large, bright yellow patches on the wings and tail. The females are similar to the males though somewhat duller, and the juveniles are rather streaky and lack the adults' distinctive head pattern. Ecology and status The Arabian Golden-winged Grosbeak is typically found between 1,060 and 2,800 metres ASL in forested wadis and areas of scrub. Its range encompasses Dhofar in Oman, the Mahra of eastern Yemen, and the mountains of northern YemenMartins (1987) to Saudi Arabia. It ranges as far north as Al Hara near Ta'if, where one or two birds were seen on April 26‚Äì27, 1996.Davidson & Kirwan (1996) In southwestern Saudi Arabia it is resident in relict East African Juniper (Juniperus procera) forests. In Yemen it has been recorded in spurge (Euphorbia) scrub and woodland of acacias (Acacia) and junipers (Juniperus), while in the wooded Mahrah it is primarily found in Anogeissus/Commiphora woodland. The fruits of juniper, acacia and spurge species appear to form the bulk of its diet. It appears to be present in low densities throughout its range. The population is estimated at around 9000 individuals, but it is becoming rare due to habitat destruction. Therefore, when it was first evaluated as a distinct species for the 2008 IUCN Red List, it was categorized as a Near Threatened species.BLI (2008a,b) Footnotes References * BirdLife International (BLI) (2008a) Arabian Grosbeak Species Factsheet.

Whilst at New College, he was a member of the team that won the second series of University Challenge. Immediately after leaving Oxford in 1966, he became a lecturer in philosophy at Reading University, remaining there until 1974, when he joined the UK Civil Service as a Direct Entry Principal. Montagu served over the next 30 years in a number of government Departments, including Health and Social Security, the Cabinet Office, Transport and Social Security. He was involved, as a civil servant, in a number of key policies for both Labour and Conservative governments, including the establishment of executive agencies, major pension reforms and the privatisation of the railway. In 1997 he was appointed Chairman of the Inland Revenue through an open competition. Over the next seven years, Montagu led the Inland Revenue through the greatest changes in its history, as it became a social department responsible for paying out what had previously been social security benefits and led the rest of Whitehall in the development of electronic services. He changed the culture of the Department, making it more outward-facing and responsive to its customers, and took a particular interest in diversity, for which he was appointed the Civil Service Diversity Champion. Montagu also chaired the Civil Service Benevolent Fund. During his time the Revenue won numerous awards for its achievements in this field. In his last year as Chairman, Montagu became embroiled in two controversies, the first when the systems installed by IT firm EDS for the new tax credits system failed to work (EDS subsequently paid nearly ¬£100m compensation for this failure ), and the second over the joint sale, with Customs, of the Revenue's estate to a company headquartered in Bermuda. This decision, required by the Treasury as part of the 1998 public spending settlement, was based on legal advice that to have excluded the company would have been illegal under European law; it was subsequently described by the National Audit Office as a model for other departments and a commercially sound deal [\\"PFI: the STEPS Deal\\" HC: 530 2003-2004 ]. Since retiring in 2004, Montagu has been associated with a number of commercial activities, mainly in the pensions and insurance field and on PricewaterhouseCoopers' Advisory Board, and with higher education. He also developed and facilitated governance workshops for Ministers and civil servants in a number of developing countries. He is currently (since February 2012) Chairman of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Chairman of Council at Queen Mary, University of London (since August 2009), and was previously Chair of the Committee of University Chairs (from 2011 -2014).

He first transmitted these to his teacher Karma Chakm√© (, 1613-1678), the illustrious Buddhist scholar of the Kagyu school, who wrote them down. The collection of his revelations fill thirteen Tibetan volumes and are the basis of one of the main practice traditions of the Palyul lineage, a major branch of the Nyingma school of Tibetan Buddhism. He was considered to be a reincarnation of Palgyi Senge of Shubu, one of the ministers the 8th- century Tibetan King Trisong Detsen sent to invite Padmasambhava to Tibet. He recognized Kunzang Sherab as the Lineage Holder of the Namch√∂ terma. Loden Chegse, one of Padmasambhava's eight emanations, had a vision which helped him learn to read and write. At age 7, his Dakini visions helped focus on reliance upon the lama. At age 10, after a vision and with a Dharma Protector's help, he met his root lama Karma Chagme. Karma Chakm√© recognized him as manifestation of Padmasambhava, Senge Dradok. Mingyur Dorje revealed the Namch√∂ treasures at age thirteen, which were written down with Karma Chakm√©'s help while they stayed in retreat together for three years.

It was created by fitting parameters of a mathematical model of the magnetic field to measured magnetic field data from surveys, observatories and satellites across the globe. The IGRF has been produced and updated under the direction of the International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy (IAGA) since 1965. The IGRF model covers a significant time span, and so is useful for interpreting historical data. (This is unlike the World Magnetic Model, which is intended for navigation in the next few years.) It is updated at 5-year intervals, reflecting the most accurate measurements available at that time. The current 13th edition of the IGRF model was released in December 2019 and is valid from 1900 until 2025. For the interval from 1945 to 2015, it is \\"definitive\\", meaning that future updates are unlikely to improve the model in any significant way.

The title is made up by Shokof, similar to many other titles of works. It is an original conceptual film about the residents of different stories in a building viewed completely through a glass elevator. Shot on location in Berlin, Germany in 2004, the film is 60 minutes long and was initially supposed to be shot \\"uncut\\" and digitally. The music score for the film is composed by Tom Dokoupil. The film was screened in BAPFF film festival in Berlin, Germany, in 2005 and at the New York International Independent Film Festival on March 4, 2007.http://www.bapff.de/site/filmven.php?lang=enghttp://www.nyfilmvideo.com/2007/la- march/schedule/la-march-2007-schedule.html Plot The stories of the people living in this building are told as camera tilts constantly up and down the 5 story building while we see the actions through the glass elevator of the building. The scenes are homages from Tati, to Buster Keaton, Hitchcock, to Bu√±uel, and finally ends with Tarantino's suitcase effect. There is a Gangster story on the fifth floor, in which a thief has stolen a suitcase from the gangsters who now know where he lives. The thief's girlfriend falls in love with the boy in the third floor who is actually an undecided homosexual who in turn falls in love with the man on the second floor, and together they beat up the boxer who helps the gangsters on the first floor. Eventually their lives interrelate to one another as they are seen appearing and disappearing in and out of the elevator. As the film continues, new stories unfold connecting the lives of the residents further and more hilariously to one another.

It exists primarily to promote and coordinate the work of translating, producing, and disseminating Bibles among Catholic laity for devotional purposes. The Federation also encourages the formation of small study groups for Bible reading as well as the creation of educational tools for use in these settings. First organized under the name The World Catholic Federation for the Biblical Apostolate in 1969, the Federation shorted its name in 1990 at its fourth Plenary Assembly held in Colombia. With the support of Cardinal Augustino Bea, its establishment was made possible by several provisions concerning lay access to Bibles that were contained in Second Vatican Council documents, especially Dei verbum. That document called for \\"easy access\\" to the Bible for \\"all the Christian faithful\\" and opened the way to cooperation with the Interconfessional United Bible Societies, particularly in the work of translation. In 1972 the Federation moved its headquarters from Rome to Stuttgart and in 1986 began publishing the quarterly Bulletin DEI VERBUM. In 2009 the General Seceretariat was moved from Stuttgart to Sankt Ottilien in Germany. Every six years the Federation holds a Plenary Assembly. The first was held in Austria in 1972 and the most recent from 19 to 23 June 2015 in Nemi. In 1985 the Federation adopted its Constitution which was approved by Rome in accordance with the norms of Canon Law. The Constitution was revised to its present form at the fifth Plenary Assembly held in Hong Kong in 1996 and approved by Rome the following year. The last revision was voted during the Plenary Assembly in Nemi. The Plenary Assembly is the highest decision- making authority within the Federation and is presided over by the General Secretary and an Executive Committee. The General Secretary is elected by the Executive Committee for a six-year renewable term. The Executive Committee consists of three ex officio members, including the General Secretary, as well as six voting members. Of this latter group members are drawn from each of the Federation's four sub-regions: Africa, the Americas, Asia/Oceania, and Europe/the Middle East. Jan J. Stefan√≥w SVD has been General Secretary since January 2014. The appointment of Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle of Manila as its President was confirmed by the Vatican on March 5, 2015.

Biography Born 1936 in Chard, Somerset, in England, to Rev. Cyril Owen Hunwick, a Methodist minister and his wife (whom he married in 1929) Doris Louise Miller. In 1938 they moved to Horsham, Sussex, where John first went to school. In 1942 the family moved to Ramsey, Huntingdonshire (now Cambridgeshire). In 1945 they moved to Bridport, Dorset, and in the following year John entered Grammar School, where he began to learn French and Latin. In 1950, he was sent to Kent College, a Methodist boarding school in Canterbury. While he was there the family moved to Shrewsbury, Shropshire. When John left Kent College, at age 18, he was drafted into the army, his home town being Shropshire, he had to join the local regiment, The King's Shropshire Light Infantry. Soon he was selected as a potential officer candidate and sent off to train at a Light Infantry camp near York. In February 1955 he was selected for full officer training, and spent four months at an officer training camp near Chester, ending up as a 2nd Lieutenant. He was given options of how and where to serve, and rather than joining his home regiment, partly involved in anti-Mau Mau fighting in Kenya, he volunteered to serve in the Somaliland Scouts, a force in what was then British Somaliland, whose regular soldiers were Somalis and its officers British. He sailed to Aden and then flew to Hargeisa in September 1955. In Somaliland his service took him first to Burao, then to Company A in Ainabo, which later moved to Hargeisa and later to Adedle. In September 1956 he attended the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), University of London. There he spent three years studying Arabic, with some courses in Islamic history and culture with professors such as Bernard Lewis, Peter Holt and Ann Lambton, while his primary teacher of the language was Marsden Jones. In 1959 he graduated with a 1st-Class Honours degree in Arabic. Early in 1960 John took a position teaching Arabic at the University of Ibadan, Nigeria (then called University College, a branch of the University of London), a few months later he was offered a \\"Lectureship\\" in Arabic, which he readily accepted. He remained at the University of Ibadan till 1967, during his time there he established a Department of Arabic and Islamic Studies, he also helped establish a Centre of Arabic Documentation for the microfilming of Arabic manuscripts, and at the same time began a journal, the Research Bulletin, to publish information on the microfilmed manuscripts and articles about the manuscript tradition. In 1967 John took a temporary Lectureship at SOAS to teach Arabic. He taught there for two academic years. Early in 1969 he was offered the position of Associate Professor in the Department of History at the University of Ghana in Legon. By then he had already begun research into historical aspects of Islam in Africa, beginning with interest in the Timbuktu tradition and the Songhay empire. While in Ghana he began teaching a year-long undergraduate course in the history of the Islamic empire from the life of the Prophet through to the 16th century in North Africa. In his first years there he also worked on his Ph.D. thesis, editing and translating with commentaries and introduction the replies of al-Maghili to questions put to him by Askiya al-hajj Muhammad of Songhay, using manuscripts Hunwick had first started studying when at the University of Ibadan. The thesis was presented and approved at SOAS in 1974, and eleven years later became the basis of his published book Shari'a in Songhay, the first of his books and public lectures. In 1981 he began his tenure at Northwestern University, holding a joint appointment in the Department of Religion and taught the social and intellectual history of Islamic Africa. As well as writing many books, he edited Religion and National Integration in Africa, and was a founder-editor of Sudanic Africa: a Journal of Historical Sources. He is former director of the Fontes Historiae Africanae project of the International Academic Union, and has received awards from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the American Council of Learned Societies, and the Fulbright Commission.

History  Mihara Castle was constructed in 1582 by Kobayakawa Takakage, who built this castle to protect the M≈çri clan's coastline.Mihara - Britannica Online Encyclopedia Takakage constructed the castle on the coast, and connected it to two small islands, thus giving the castle its nickname- Ukishiro (floating castle). It had three baileys, thirty-two yagura, and fourteen gates. The tenshu (keep) was never constructed, though its foundation was completed, and is believed to be the largest ever constructed. After Toyotomi Hideyoshi conquered Ky≈´sh≈´, Takakage was rewarded for being a loyal follower by being given land in Chikuzen, Chikugo, and Bizen. As a result, he moved to Najima Castle. However, he returned to reside at Mihara Castle following his 1595 retirement, and died there in 1597. During the Meiji Restoration, Mihara Castle avoided the destruction that most Japanese castles suffered during this era, due primarily to the fact that it became an Imperial Japanese Naval base. However, many of the stone walls were torn down and all buildings demolished when Mihara Train Station was built in the castle in 1894 following the decommissioning of the naval base. It was further demolished in 1975, when a shinkansen station and track split what remained in half. Today The ruins are preserved in a park, though the shinkansen inhibits traveling around the castle.The Cultural and Historic CROSSROADS of Japan / Map Search The base of the tenshu still stands and it is possible to stand on it and get a good view of Mihara City.

He commanded an Ohio regiment and, frequently, a brigade, during the war, and played a role in the defense of Culp's Hill during the July 1863 Battle of Gettysburg. Early life and career Candy was born in Lexington, Kentucky. He joined the United States Army on May 14, 1850, as an enlisted man with the rank of private and subsequently served in a wide variety of garrisons and outposts. He served under Richard S. Ewell in the 1st Dragoons. He was promoted to corporal in March 1853. Candy was honorably discharged in May 1855. Candy resumed his military career in January 1856 as a private in the 1st U.S. Infantry. In May 1856, he was promoted to sergeant. By the eve of the Civil War, he was a sergeant major. Discharged from the regular army on January 1, 1861, Candy became a volunteer clerk in the Department of the Ohio.Pfanz, pp. 223-24. Civil War service Following the outbreak of the Civil War and the firing on the Union garrison at Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor, Candy was appointed on September 21, 1861, as a captain and assistant adjutant general of volunteers. He served on the staff of Charles Pomeroy Stone at the time of the Battle of Ball's Bluff. Candy resigned his staff position on December 3, 1861. He was commissioned colonel of the 66th Ohio Infantry on December 17 of that year.Eicher, p. 162. Candy led his regiment under Nathaniel Banks in what became II Corps of John Pope's Army of Virginia, serving in John W. Geary's brigade of Christopher C. Augur's division. When Geary was wounded in the Battle of Cedar Mountain, Candy succeeded to brigade command. Banks's corps missed the Second Battle of Bull Run, and Candy was absent when the corps--newly dubbed XII Corps, Army of the Potomac--fought in the Battle of Antietam. XII Corps was in reserve during the Battle of Fredericksburg, but it participated in Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside's Mud March. Candy next saw action leading the First Brigade of Geary's Second Division, XII Corps, at the Battle of Chancellorsville. He commanded the same brigade at the Battle of Gettysburg, arriving on the Baltimore Pike, behind the Union right, late on the first day of the fight (July 1, 1863). Late in the day, Geary led the brigades of George S. Greene and Candy to Little Round Top to protect the Union left flank. The brigade returned to the right early the next day and took part in the defense of Culp's Hill. Candy's brigade was in reserve, except when Geary--trying to go to the relief of the left flank of the army--got lost and took it and the brigade of George A. Cobham, Jr., down the Baltimore Pike in the wrong direction.Pfanz, p. 130; Greene, pp. 169-203. When XII Corps was transferred west under the command of Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker later in 1863 to relieve the Army of the Cumberland besieged at Chattanooga, Candy was transferred with his brigade. It fought at the Battle of Wauhatchie. Candy was injured early in the Battle of Lookout Mountain, and he also missed the Battle of Ringgold Gap. When XII Corps and XI Corps were combined into Hooker's XX Corps of the Army of the Cumberland, Candy became commander of a brigade in Geary's second division. He led it in Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman's Atlanta Campaign until August 4, 1864. Candy was mustered out of the volunteer service on January 14, 1865, and he received a brevet appointment as a brigadier general on March 13, 1865.Pfanz, p. 224. Postbellum career After the war, Candy served as chief clerk in the Quartermaster General's office of the War Department. From 1888 to 1906, he was commissary of subsistence for the Southern Branch of the National Home for Disabled Soldiers. Candy died in Dayton, Ohio.

It was built in 1926 as the Belcrest Hotel, designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1983, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. It is significant as an early example of the apartment hotel development concept in Detroit, and a major early work of architect Charles N. Agree. History The Belcrest Apartment Hotel was built in 1926 as a residential hotel, catering to wealthy tenants.The Belcrest from Detroit1701.org The building exemplified what was, at the time, a novel style of living arrangement: an apartment building that offered amenities normally associated with a hotel. Daily maid service and a restaurant on the premises set this apart from a conventional apartment building. The building was developed by Jacob Singer and Max Hamburger, who hired Charles N. Agree as both architect and general contractor for the building. In 1929, Singer and Hamburger signed an agreement to make the Belcrest a part of the Albert Pick hotel chain. Architecture The Belcrest The Belcrest is a twelve-story, T-shaped apartment building, constructed of concrete and steel and sheathed with brick and terra cotta.The Belcrest from the state of Michigan Three projecting bays surround the base of the T, emphasizing the vertical, and extend up through the cornice to end in an ornamented gable. The three bays have elaborate detail on the twelfth floor, containing alternating bands of brick and terra cotta, round-arched masonry window openings, and terra cotta diaperwork. Terra cotta cornices on the third, eleventh, and top floors emphasize the horizontal. The grey and cream second-floor cornice is further embellished with dentils, rope molding, and acanthus leaf molding. The tan and dark brown eleventh-floor corniceline has green highlights, and breaks at terra cotta balconets beneath the twelfth-floor windows. The tan twelfth floor cornice is molded into the form of a series of arches and acanthus leaf brackets, topped with an acanthus leaf molding. A gabled single story entry foyer echoes the form of the twelfth floor gables. The entryway is reached through original wrought iron entry gates.

With his body covered by black and white stripes and highlighted by a glowing aura, he became Zebra-Man. He went on a crime spree where he encountered Batman and Robin. During the first fight, Batman was accidentally irradiated by the same energy. Without an inhibitor belt, Batman was out of control with his diamagnetism causing Robin to go on without him. Batman soon took advantage of the diamagnetism and used it to attract Zebra-Man to himself and then attract both of them to Gotham City Police Department.Detective Comics #275. DC Comics.

Solar Entertainment had acquired the rights to the PBA after a highly publicized bidding war with major broadcaster ABS-CBN, and aired games on several channels, including Basketball TV, the Radio Philippines Network (which Solar was operating), and later the ABS-CBN-owned Studio 23. PBA telecasts moved to AKTV after Solar's contract ended in 2011. History Bidding process The Associated Broadcasting Company (ABC) had broadcast PBA games since 2004 on its VHF Channel 5, succeeding the failed NBN and IBC consortium which left the league in debt. ABC's current contract would expire at the end of the 2007-08 season, so the league began to accept bids for the next contract. ABC, the ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation (through ABS-CBN Sports), and the Solar Entertainment Corporation emerged as frontrunners. ABS- CBN has served as the official broadcaster of UAAP basketball games since 2000. As part of its bid for the contract, ABS-CBN organized a charity exhibition game which aired on Studio 23, featuring PBA alumni from the Ateneo Blue Eagles and the De La Salle Green Archers. Solar Entertainment had recently begun a partnership with RPN to provide programming for the network, primarily in response to a carriage dispute with ABS-CBN-owned cable provider SkyCable; which saw 6 of its networks (including its sports channels Solar Sports and Basketball TV) pulled from its systems in January 2008. However, ABC was reported to be piqued at the way the league was handling the bidding practice, hence it backed out of the bidding process. ABC had paid ‚Ç±70 million to air the 2007-08 season, its last. The backing out of ABC narrowed down the field to two possible broadcasters; ABS-CBN (who would broadcast games on its main network and Studio 23), and Solar Entertainment (who would air games on Basketball TV and RPN, which Solar then operated under the on-air brand C/S 9). GMA Network was also reportedly planning to bid but backed out; it however denied that they offered a bid. Another bidder eventually came into force, the Makisig Network; which would air the games on Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation's DZTV-TV. However, it was reported that both ABS-CBN and Solar submitted identical bids to the PBA Board: ‚Ç±160 million for the first year, ‚Ç±168 million for the second and ‚Ç±170 million for the third year (compared to ABC's ‚Ç±70 million for its fifth year). PBA Chairman Tony Chua of Red Bull Barako pushed the board to come out with a decision as soon as possible; former PBA chairman Ricky Vargas of the Talk 'N Text Phone Pals, a supporter of the ABS-CBN bid, said that money should not be a deciding factor. Also, Chua announced that Nielsen Media Research would research the comparative reach, demographics and audience share of both bids and present their findings to the PBA board. After receiving Nielsen's data, another provider, Mind Shares, was consulted. By this time, the bids were now slightly different: Solar's bid was ‚Ç±31 million greater than the amount ABS-CBN offered for the first three years of the contract, while ABS-CBN offered a four-year package with the option to sign a three-year contract-extension at the end of the initial deal, with Solar a straight-up three-year deal. ABS-CBN backed out its bid after receiving a solitary vote in the 9-member board. However, Solar Sports didn't automatically clinch the bid outright since the league was \\"insisting on a lockout to protect business interests of its team members\\". It was revealed that, according to Mind Share, if the PBA aired on RPN, it would rate 7.9%, while if it aired on Studio 23, it would rate 1.8%, \\"without taking into consideration the tremendous cross-promotions boost that would immediately impact on ratings under an ABS-CBN partnership.\\" This caused Solar Sports to be the de facto front-runner. Solar and the PBA On May 27, 2008 the PBA announced that Solar Sports had won the rights with a deal reportedly worth ‚Ç±508 million. Aside from live games aired on RPN, Solar would provide additional coverage on its Basketball TV cable channel. The return of the PBA to RPN dates back to the inaugural season of the PBA in 1975 when games were broadcast on KBS. During an October 15, 2010 double-header during the Philippine Cups' elimination round, Solar's satellite equipment experienced multiple faults, including alleged problems with the encoder and power amplifier. These technical problems caused intermittent interruptions to the telecasts, and forced a game between the Meralco Bolts and the Talk 'N Text Tropang Texters to be aired on Basketball TV the next day on tape delay. The technical problems resulted in commissioner Chito Salud issuing a ‚Ç±3,000,000 fine to Solar for not broadcasting a game live, a condition of the network's contract with the league. In a meeting with the PBA's board, Solar also promised that it would take steps to improve the quality of its telecasts and prevent such issues from occurring in the future.PBA board to discuss issues on TV coverage, Rey Joble, GMANews.tv, November 8, 2010PBA, SolarTV vow better TV coverage of games, Rey Joble, GMANews.tv, November 9, 2010 Move to Studio 23 In December 2010, Solar Entertainment announced that they would be seeking a new broadcast television partner for its PBA coverage due to a planned relaunch of the Solar TV network, with a new lineup aimed more towards women (resulting in the dropping of all other sports programming from its lineup).Solar drops PBA for ‚Äòfeminine‚Äô programs , Musong R.

Ikonboard History Early years Ikonboard was originally developed by Matt Mecham, with the first release being Ikonboard 0.9 beta in September 1999. Originally much of the development took place on ikondiscussion.com (no longer active) until it suffered a server crashIkonboard.com in March 2001 regarding server crash. in March 2001 and it was initially thought everything might have been lost, including early work on version 3. As a result, they switched to Ikonboard.com, and by April 2001 the majority had been recovered. During ownership of Jarvis Entertainment Group (JEG)  In late April 2001 Ikonboard officially joined the Jarvis Network.Ikonboard joins the Jarvis networkJEG announcement of it acquiring Ikonboard At this point the latest available release was 2.1.8, with 3.0 in beta development. Matt Mecham sold Ikonboard to the Jarvis Entertainment Group for 50,000 shares of common stock in the publicly traded company, but said in a 2002 interview that he was unable to sell any of the shares. Soon after the release of 3.0 Mecham stopped developing Ikonboard, and departed to work on Invision Power Board. It is believed that Mecham had been paying for the domain during the time JEG owned Ikonboard. A year after his departure the DNS was altered to point to a holding page which redirected users to other software,Ikonboard.com Domain under dispute (WayBackMachine February 2003) during this time there was a legal dispute over the domain ownership. After the departure of Matt Mecham, owner of JEG made a public request for individuals to staff and develop Ikonboard. As a result, a group of individuals emerged with separate development and support teams formed. Amongst the others to later emerge were Sly, Camil, Quasi and these along with the others were seen as the 'second set' of coders. On June 12, 2002 Ikonboard 3.1 was made Ikonboard.com upon releasing 3.1 with plans for PHP versions being announced at the same time. Initially the release represented small bug fixes to Mechams' 3.0.x series. In October 2003 chairman (and CEO) of JEG John Jarvis was forced out of JEG.JEG Management list prior to departure and indicating approximate date of change. During ownership of Westlin Corporation In February 2004 the company changed its name to Westlin Corporation.The Westlin site after the company changed name from JEG. The departure of the second set of coders was fairly low profile, with many of them departing to work on their own project Infinite Core Technology. In summer 2005 it emerged that former JEG chairman John Jarvis was taking legal action against Westlin, to regain ownership of Ikonboard amongst other things. During much of September that year the sites' server was down. Westlin declined to comment on the outage, prompting several staff members to quit. In October 2005, with Westlin still declining to talk to the support staff and developers, Ikonboard releases were no longer available for download. During ownership post-Westlin Corporation On October 28, 2005, after weeks of speculation, ownership of Ikonboard was officially transferred to John Jarvis. However the change of ownership resulted in the site being down until December, with a new parent company 'Pitboss Entertainment'.Ikonboard.com in December 2005 finally accessible after ownership change. Though John Jarvis officially owned Ikonboard he had no visible presence on the site, with Joshua Johnson managing Ikonboard on his behalf. Soon after coming back online development on 3.1.3 resumed, being developed by a group of volunteers who referred to themselves as 'The Ikonboard Team' (and in addition provided support via the site's forums). Ikonboard 3.1.3 was publicly released on January 30, 2006, and 3.1.4 was subsequently released in February. On March 22, 2006, it was announced that the parent company Pitboss Enterntainment no longer existed, and that all its assets (including Ikonboard) now came under 'Level 6 Studios', and subsequently related contact details were amended.Revised contact details after Pitboss ceased existing Development was unaffected by the parent company changes, and 3.1.5 was publicly released on May 30, 2006. Additionally the Ikonboard team started development on '3.2' though their work was never publicly released under the Ikonboard name. On September 10, 2006 development on this release was discontinued as the Ikonboard team departed to work on IkonForums 1.0.0,Ikonboard team departure (September 2006) their own independent project. With most of the developers gone efforts began on recruiting new developers, and plans for forthcoming releases were announced. In January 2007 the domain record contacts were revised to those of John Jarvis. This change implied that John Jarvis was still the owner of at least the domain, which appeared to contradict announcements made by those managing the site. For most of June 2007 Ikonboard suffered downtime, with 'DNS issues' being cited as the cause. On January 8, 2008 the (former) official German support site 'ikonboard.de - Reloaded' completed its transition in converting to IkonForums, though still provided support for Ikonboard. During ownership - Ikonboard Services Inc. As of September 2009, ownership of the ikonboard name (and possibly the software itself) passed back to Joshua Johnson. In June 2010, Ikonboard 3.1.5A was released, containing bug fixes and minor updates. In May 2012 it was reported that Ikonboard PHP was making progress, and is now used as the support forum. However, as of January 2017 no new software releases have been made, and their website has ceased to exist. The WHOIS records suggest the domain is no longer owned by either Ikonboard Services Inc or Joshua Johnson. Version History Ikonboard 0.9 The first released version of Ikonboard was 0.9 beta, in September 1999. It was written by Matthew Mecham in Perl and stored all data in flat text files. Compared to present-day message board software, such as Mecham's own Invision Power Board, it contained only basic features. Ikonboard 1.x Releases in the 1.x series of Ikonboard built on the original 0.9 beta code. It was still authored entirely by Mecham, and stored data in text files. Ikonboard 2.1.x Ikonboard's 2.1.x series incorporated some of the ideas and developments from the 1.x series, but started with a new codebase. It was with the 2.1.x series releases that Ikonboard really became popular on the web, perhaps due to its status as a free alternative to UBB. The 2.1.x releases of Ikonboard contained many of the features found in today's forum software. As with previous releases, Ikonboard 2.1.x releases were written in Perl and used a flat file storage system. While the actual code for the software continued to be written exclusively by Mecham, other members from the \\"Ikonboard community\\" assisted in providing things like images and documentation. Ikonboard 2.2 Ikonboard 2.2 was an effort to continue improving the 2.x series after Mecham shifted his efforts to Ikonboard 3.0, and development occurred alongside that of Ikonboard 3.0. Most of the development, promotion, and support efforts were focused on the 3.0 series, however, and there has never been a stable release of Ikonboard 2.2. Since late December 2005 the download for the 2.2 development was removed from the site, and effectively discontinued as the team work on the 3.x series. Ikonboard 3.0 Ikonboard 3.0 represented a \\"total rewrite\\" for Ikonboard. The board was still coded entirely in Perl; however, Mecham adopted an object-oriented style of coding, and did away with flat files in favor of storage abstraction, allowing data storage in a relational database such as MySQL or Oracle. After the release of Ikonboard 3.0, Mecham stopped developing Ikonboard. Further releases in the 3.0.x series represented small fixes and improvements on Mecham's 3.0.0 code. Ikonboard 3.1 As the new developers gained familiarity with the code, larger changes were made in the 3.1.x series releases. For a long time the stable version was 3.1.2a. Noticeable additions included the addition of a 'quick reply' box below topics. The next release was due to be 3.2 and was originally started in 2003. However, for various reasons work of this version stalled, this resulting in the next release of Ikonboard becoming 3.1.3 and was developed mainly by 2 coders. With the change of ownership around August 2005 the two coders departed leaving development on 3.1.3 at beta 09 stage. When Ikonboard returned online work on 3.1.3 continued, and Ikonboard 3.1.3 was publicly released on January 30, 2006. It contained many new features as well as fixing bugs and a couple security issues. The most significant new additions in this release was Humain Readable Image (HRI) on registration which keeps malicious users from mass registering, and an update centre in the adminCP. Within a few weeks 3.1.4 was released, this release fixed bugs found since the previous release. On 2 June 2006 another release was made, like the previous release 3.1.5 fixed bugs that had been found. June 2010 Ikonboard Released 3.1.5a with minor updates and bug releases. Ikonboard 3.2 Ikonboard 3.2 is yet to be publicly released, though already has a notable history. Originally development began in late April 2003, however work on this release stalled, and development made later became part of iB 3.1.3. Then development on this release was restarted on February 10, 2006 by 'The Ikonboard Team', however they departed on September 10, 2006 taking their work with them to IkonForums. Since their departure Ikonboards' developer has said that he'll be working on a 3.2 release.Development on iB 3.2 by Level 6 Studios The release is believed to be similar to the previous development, with additional features similar to those found on Netgimmicks.com and Swarf.net. In January 2008 it was announced via mass email that '3.2 would be released in February 2008', and a topic in the support forums also announced its forums would be upgraded on 14 February to this release. However to date no release has been made and the topic has been removed. It has also been noticed that users enquiring about the 3.2 release via the forums have had their posting rights removed and the threads have been removed within a few days. Related products myIkonboard myIkonboard is a separate product originally created by Ikonboards' parent company.

In March 2006 it was announced by Ikonboards' new owners that myIkonboard would return, powered by the Ikonboard Perl software.

As of February 2010, myIkonboard is now back online, under control of ikonboard. Ikonboard PHP (Project Mongoose) In 2002 work on a PHP based version of Ikonboard was commissioned. This work was entitled \\"Project Mongoose\\" and was a complete re- write of Ikonboard in PHP. It was similar only in name and ownership. Once 'Project Mongoose' reached a release candidate stage the core functionality which included an advanced session-handler and template system, then owners (Jarvis Entertainment Group, Inc.) requested that the existing MyIkonboard service - which was based on the Perl-Based Ikonboard product and running on over a dozen Windows-based servers. Ikonboard PHP was adapted to a multi-user system that allowed thousands of individual forums to be created and hosted through a completely PHP-based service and a converter was created to automate the process of transferring forums that were hosted on the old Perl-based MyIkonboard service. There was never a public release of Ikonboard PHP because the developers left the company in February 2003. Ikonboard PHP Lite Ikonboard PHP Lite was a re-branded version of a forum that was purchased by John Jarvis (Then CEO of Jarvis Entertainment Group) through an eBay auction. The only involvement the Project Mongoose developers had with this product was building a rudimentary installer at the request of Jarvis Entertainment Group.)

Paris is home to a small Filipino community. History During the centennial of the French Revolution in 1889, Jos√© Rizal sought to organize a conference called the Association Internationale des Philippinistes which was to be launched with Ferdinand Blumentritt, the President and Edmond Plauchut, the Vice President. The French also permitted Rizal to live in exile in France where he wrote the books Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo. On June 26, 1947 the Philippines and France signed a Treaty of Amity which established diplomatic relations with the 2 countries. Filipinos Today Filipinos living in France work as artists, domestic servants, professionals, students, and writers, or in the health care, information technology, and electronics sectors. The French government encouraged Filipinos to work in France, as long as they eventually returned to the Philippines, by instituting new migration laws. Brice Hortefeux, French Minister for Immigration, Integration, National Identity and Development Solidarity, said, \\"I‚Äôve already put in place, for particularly skilled workers, a specific procedure allowing them a three-year, once-renewable, permit to stay in France. This shows that by encouraging the movement of skilled workers, we are rejecting the brain drain ... We hope it will be useful to both countries.\\" 10% of Filipinos living in France have married French citizens. By 2000, 5,823 French citizens had been born in the Philippines, including both French nationals and naturalized Filipinos. Only one school in France, the EFI Langue Institut Linguistique Europ√©en in Saint- Germain-en-Laye, offers classes about the Filipino language. 16% of Filipinos in France are between 16 and 25 years of age, 50% are between 26 and 35, 29% are between 36 and 45, and 6% are older than 46.

It is a baseball video game developed by PawaPuro Production for Nintendo's Wii and Sony's PlayStation 2 video game consoles, as well as the Nintendo DS handheld, and is part of the traditionally Japan-only Power Pros series of video games. The game was released in 2008 and published by 2K Sports. The game retains the same look, feel, and gameplay as its predecessor, but features updated rosters, new modes (such as MLB Life), new features (in-game bullpen control), among others. MLB Life The new mode on MLB Power Pros 2008 is about carrying on a career as a professional player (for the purposes of this section, \\"users\\" are those playing the video game, whereas \\"players\\" are the in-game characters); this player can be one of three things. First, the player may already be in the majors or triple A. Second, users can create a player and customize his skills. Third, users can use a created player from success mode; this player has made it to the major league level. During a game instead of pitching and batting the whole game, users will bat and run the bases as the individual player, and control other players on the bases. (This requires the user to enable the option of manual base running.) When the user plays as a pitcher, he or she will pitch only when the player is on the mound; fielding is computer-controlled. When controlling a player, users will have a day planner every day. Most days there will be a period of time were users can choose what to do, called Free Time. Some would be hobbies like golf, driving, darts and reading. Another option is to rest, where players gain vitality and (in some cases) lower fatigue. There is also practice alone. That is when users will work on skills. Finally, there is Chat option, where players can talk to fellow baseball players, agents, managers, ladies, and others. After 20 years or if players are showing age and have put up the significant statistics, the player's time to retire will come. After notifying the manager, a retirement date will be set. Once the player has played that day, his career will come to an end. At that point, the player will have finished MLB life on MLB Power Pros 2008. Cover The cover features 8 then-MLB stars: Chien-Ming Wang, Magglio Ord√≥√±ez, Jimmy Rollins, Prince Fielder, Derrek Lee, Francisco Rodr√≠guez, Takashi Saito, and Josh Beckett. Reception The Wii version received \\"generally favorable reviews\\", while the DS and PlayStation 2 versions received \\"average\\" reviews, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.

He was among the first to write books on science for a broad Jewish audience, and was the founder of Ha- Tsfira, the first Hebrew-language newspaper with an emphasis on the sciences. Biography ·∏§ayyim Selig Slonimski was born in Bialystok, in the Grodno Governorate of the Russian Empire (present-day Poland), the oldest son of Rabbi Avraham Ya'akov Bishka and Leah (Neches) Bishka. His father belonged to a family of rabbis, writers, publishers and printers, and his mother was the daughter of Rabbi Ye·∏•iel Neches, an owner of a well-known beit midrash in Bialystok. Slonimski had a traditional Jewish upbringing and Talmudic education; without a formal secular education, Slonimski taught himself mathematics, astronomy, and foreign languages. An advocate for the education of Eastern European Jews in the sciences, Slonimski introduced a vocabulary of technical terms created partly by himself into the Hebrew language. At age 24, he finished writing a textbook on mathematics, but due to lack of funds, only the first part of which was published in 1834 under the title Mosedei ·∏§okhmah. The following year, Slonimski released Sefer Kokhva de-Shavit (1835), a collection of essays on Halley's comet and other astronomy-related topics such as the laws of Kepler and Newton's laws of motion. In 1838, Slonimski settled in Warsaw, where he became acquainted with mathematician and inventor Abraham Stern (1768‚Äì1842), whose youngest daughter Sarah Gitel he would later marry in 1842. There he published another astronomical work, the highly popular Toldot ha-Shamayim (1838). Slonimski in the 1840s He also tried his hand at the applied sciences, and a number of his technological inventions received recognition and awards. The most notable of his inventions was his calculating machine, created in 1842 based on his tables, which he exhibited to the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences, and for which he was awarded the 1844 Demidov Prize of 2,500 rubles by the Russian Academy of Sciences. He also received a title of honorary citizen, which granted him the right to live outside of the Pale of Settlement to which Jews were normally restricted. In 1844, he published a new formula in Crelle's Journal for calculating the Jewish calendar. In 1853 he invented a chemical process for plating iron vessels with lead to prevent corrosion, and in 1856 a device for simultaneously sending multiple telegrams using just one telegraphic wire. The system of multiple telegraphy perfected by Lord Kelvin in 1858 was based on Slonimski's discovery. Slonimski lived between 1846 and 1858 in Tomasz√≥w Mazowiecki, an industrial town in central Poland. He corresponded with several scientists, notably Alexander von Humboldt, and wrote a sketch of Humboldt's life. In February 1862 in Warsaw, Slonimski launched Ha-Tsfira, the first Hebrew newspaper in Poland, and was the publisher, editor, and chief contributor. It ceased publication after six months due to his departure on the eve of the January Uprising from Warsaw to Zhitomir, the capital of the Ukrainian province Volhynia. There Slonimski was appointed as principal of the rabbinical seminary in Zhitomir and as government censor of Hebrew books. After the seminary was closed by the Russian government in 1874, Slonimski resumed the publication of Ha-Tsfira, first in Berlin and then again in Warsaw, after he obtained the necessary permission from the tsarist government. The newspaper would quickly become a central cultural institution of Polish Jewry. He died in Warsaw on May 15, 1904.  The Stalin controversy  Slonimski's grave at Warsaw Jewish Cemetery In 1952, Josef Stalin made a speech in which, among other things, he claimed that it was a Russian who had beat out America in the 19th century in the development of the telegraph. While Stalin's claim was mocked in the United States, Slonimsky's grandson, the musicologist Nicolas Slonimsky, was able to confirm the accuracy of some of Stalin's claims.

It lies along Route 11 on the other side of the river from Beattyville south of the city of Beattyville, the county seat of Lee County. Proctor is also located near the beginning point of the Kentucky River. There are three tributaries which combine near Beattyville and Proctor; the North Fork of the Kentucky River, the Middle Fork of the Kentucky River; and the South Fork of the Kentucky River. For this reason, many local businesses make mention of the \\"Three Forks\\". Map of the watershed of the Kentucky River, showing the North Fork, Middle Fork, and South Fork tributaries. History After the American Revolutionary War, many veterans settled in the mountains of Kentucky, one of whom was Archibald D. McGuire. who fought in the Battle of Tippecanoe. He came to the Three Forks area from the Boonesborough, Kentucky Settlement in 1799 and settled on what is now the James H. McIntosh farm located in Proctor, the site of a large spring. In 1848 the town of Proctor was established. It was named after Joseph Proctor, a companion of Daniel Boone, who traveled often in the area as a circuit preacher. Early Proctor enterprises included hotels, groceries, carpentry, basket making, boat building, salt gathering, coal mining, timber operations, and flour milling. The community of Proctor was originally located within Estill County, but was assigned to the Lee County area when Lee County was formed in 1870 and was the first county seat. Its post office operated from 1843 until 1918. The first court was held on April 25, 1870 in the Old Howerton House. Samuel and Patience Kelly Beatty sold their land along the Kentucky River to encourage the establishment of a town across the river from Proctor. In 1850 \\"Beattyville\\" was chartered. In 1862, the Proctor flour mill was burned by troops of CSA Colonel John Hunt Morgan as he attempted to stop the retreat of General George W. Morgan (USA) from Cumberland Gap. Lee County was established as Kentucky's 115th county on March 1, 1870 from part of Owsley, Wolfe, Breathitt and Estill counties. Lee County may have been named for Confederate General Robert E. Lee, but many early settlers came from Lee County, Virginia and the name may have derived therefrom. James Madison Beatty, the first County Attorney, and his wife Josephine, donated land in Beattyville for a courthouse and jail, and the county seat soon moved across the river to Beattyville.

The station was opened on 2 January 1893 by the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (later part of the Great Central Railway and subsequently the LNER), on its line from Beighton in the outskirts of Sheffield to Annesley in Nottinghamshire, which later became part of the Great Central main line to London. Along much of the route between Sheffield and Nottingham the line ran through a mainly industrial landscape dominated by mining. Pilsley had its own colliery a short distance to the north of the station, with extensive sidings on both sides of the main line. The Midland Railway also gained access to Pilsley colliery, via a section about 2.5 miles in length which branched off their Erewash Valley Line just to the north of Doe Hill station, and ran across country to join the Great Central at Pilsley, running virtually alongside Pilsley station before making its connection with the line near the colliery. Pilsley station closed on 2 November 1959, the line itself on 5 September 1966. The collieries also closed around this time, although coal mining continued to be a source of employment for the village until the 1980s. The route of the Great Central line was redeveloped by Derbyshire County Council in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and now forms part of the Five Pits Trail network. These efforts received a Countryside Award in 1970, as indicated by a plaque at the site of Pilsley station. The trail runs approximately 12 miles, from Tibshelf to Grassmoor Country Park, though with the filling in of cuttings and removal of embankments it is virtually unrecognisable as a former railway line. Similarly the collieries that had once been such conspicuous features of the landscape have vanished without trace. The area is now once again mostly rural in character.

KOVE-FM is owned by Uforia Audio Network, a division of Univision Communications. The studios are in Uptown Houston and the transmitter is in Santa Fe, Texas. History This specific facility, licensed to Galveston in 1990, is in no way related to the previous Galveston station launched in 1968 as KGBC-FM (106.1 FM), then sold and moved to 106.5 FM, and re-licensed as KUFO in 1974. That facility, with shifting ownership and declining fortunes, became KXKX in 1979 and KQQK. The original 106.5 signed off forever in 1986, ultimately having its license cancelled by the FCC in March 1989. KQQK This incarnation of 106.5 was licensed and signed on January 8, 1990, retaining the KQQK calls used by the former KUFO facility before its license was surrendered nearly a year earlier. The new KQQK became a wildly successful Tejano format, utilizing a bilingual approach in both music and presentation. Its branding was simply its dial position and calls, spoken as \\"1-oh-6-5, Kah-Koo-Koo-Kah\\". The popular Tejano format proved to be a hit with 2nd and 3rd generation Mexican Americans living within the coverage area, and remained well rated throughout the 1990s, and a vital partner and asset to the Mexican-American community for over a decade. In July 2001, this facility was sold to Univision predecessor Hispanic Broadcasting Corporation, forcing KQQK, Inc. (Predecessor to El Dorado Communications) to move the already waning Tejano format to the then sister Beaumont facility KXTJ, another rimshot signal to Houston, but with less penetration into Houston proper, where the Tejano format eventually collapsed and was replaced by a Spanish Dance format, leaving AM 980 KRTX as Houston's sole broadcast home for \\"Puro Tejano\\" music. KRTX has since been sold and became a Spanish Christian formatted station itself. K-Love With the format and calls of KQQK now officially moved to 107.9 in Beaumont, 106.5 temporarily assumed the KQBU callset and continued simulcasting KQQK for a brief period. Towards the end of July 2001, Spanish language Romantic Adult Contemporary \\"K-Love\\" debuted on KQBU, which coincided with the second call change inside a month to the current KOVE. K-Love would continue, with positive, sustainable ratings and cume, for the next decade. During this period, KOVE upgraded to the current Class C, 98 kilowatt, 598 meter HAAT operations. Recuerdo, M√°s Variedad, and Amor First given the name \\"Recuerdo\\", then adjusting to \\"M√°s Variedad\\", 106.5 has become a Spanish Adult Hits format that blends the larger hits of the grupero, regional Mexican and contemporary ballad music styles of Northern Mexico. Most of M√°s Variedad's music focuses on hits from the 80s and 90s, however, a small percentage of KOVE's playlist expands into more recent music offerings from the 21st Century. The station's slogan is \\"M√°s musica y Variedad\\", translated to English as \\"More Music and Variety\\". On February 7, 2018, Univision dropped the \\"M√°s Variedad\\" Spanish Adult Hits format and switched it to Spanish AC as Amor 106.5.Univision Brings Amor to Five Markets Radioinsight - February 7, 2018 The brand returns to Houston a decade later when its sister KAMA-FM used the name from 2007 to 2008.

Their common behavioural function is starting a new colony, to expand their mother colonies etc. Colonies of termites and ants produce alates. It is a flight-based form of reproductive technique. In a termite colony, alates (winged males and winged females) disperse in a specific period or a month. Male and female pair to each other during flight, shed their wings, and start a new colony. Alate is an adjective that refers to wings or winglike structures. In entomology it usually refers to the winged form of a social insect, especially ants or termites, though can also be applied to aphids and some thrips. Alate females are typically those destined to become gynes (queens), whereas alate males are occasionally referred to as \\"drones\\" (or \\"kings\\", in the case of termites). However, the existence of reproductives that do not have wings (e.g., ergatoid queens and gamergates) necessitates a term to distinguish the winged from the wingless reproductive forms. This is an example of polymorphism associated with eusociality. A \\"dealate\\" is an adult insect that shed or lost its wings (\\"dealation\\"). In botany Euonymus alatus has wing-like structures on the stems In botany alate refers to winglike structures on some seeds that use wind dispersal or it may be used to describe flattened ridges which run longtitudianally on stems.

R. socotranus is by some authorities held to be the only species of the then-monotypic genus Rhynchostruthus, including all other golden-winged grosbeaks therein as subspecies. But in recent times the three populations are usually considered a distinct species, with R. socotranus being limited to the Socotra population, the Arabian golden-winged grosbeak becoming R. percivali, and the Somali golden-winged grosbeak R. louisae.Kirwan & Grieve (2007) Description The males are grey-brown overall with a black bill, a dark head with a black mask, large white cheek patches, and large, bright yellow patches on the wings and tail. The females are similar to the males though somewhat duller, and the juveniles are rather streaky and lack the adults' distinctive head pattern. Ecology and status The Socotra golden-winged grosbeak is found in a variety of habitats from the mountains to sea-level. It typically inhabits fairly arid scrub- or woodland dominated by spurges (Euphorbia), acacias (Acacia) and juniper (Juniperus). The fruits of these plants appear to form the bulk of its diet. The population is estimated to be about 6500 adult individuals. Despite being limited to a single island, its future appears to be rather secure. Consequently, the IUCN still classifies it as a species of least concern, even after the mainland populations have been split off.BLI (2004, 2008) Footnotes References * BirdLife International (BLI) (2008) Socotra Grosbeak Species Factsheet.

(Pienemann 1998) The theory has been used as a framework by scientists from Europe, North America, Asia and Australia. Processability theory (PT) is a cognitive approach to second language acquisition that seeks to explain developmental schedules as well as learner variation. It is based on Levelt‚Äôs (1989) approach to language generation and is formally operationalized using Lexical-Functional Grammar (Bresnan 2001). PT‚Äôs core assumption is that learners can produce only what they can process. PT is therefore based on the architecture of human language generation that is constructed hierarchically. It is argued that learners are constrained to follow that hierarchical order of processability in acquiring any target language. In other words, the hierarchy of processability is the core of the predictive machinery entailed in PT. Of course, the hierarchy must be applied to the specific conditions of any target language. This is done using LFG formalisms. When applied to ESL, this results in an array of predictions for developmental schedules in syntax and morphology. For instance, word order is predicted to be initially constrained to canonical word order even in questions, as Do-support and auxiliary inversion would require processing resources that are not initially available. PT also includes theoretical modules dealing with L1 transfer, inter-learner variation and the role of linguistic typology. It comes with detailed methodological tools. PT has been applied to second language classrooms and to linguistic profiling.  Commentary  Processability Theory is now a mature theory of grammatical development of learners' interlanguage. It is cognitively founded (hence applicable to any language), formal and explicit (hence empirically testable), and extended, having not only formulated and tested hypotheses about morphology, syntax and discourse-pragmatics, but having also paved the way for further developments at the interface between grammar and the lexicon and other important modules in SLA. Among the most important SLA theories recently discussed in Van Patten (2007), no other can accommodate such a variety of phenomena or seems able to offer the basis for so many new directions. Ten years have gone by since Pienemann‚Äôs first book-length publication on PT in 1998; and before that, it took almost two decades to mould into PT the initial intuition by the ZISA team that the staged development of German word order could be explained by psycholinguistic constraints universally applicable to all languages (Pienemann 1981; Clahsen, Meisel & Pienemann 1983). In these three decades, the whole field of SLA has grown exponentially. PT has paralleled this growth, and widened its scope in several directions. First, ZISA‚Äôs intuitions have been applied to English (Pienemann & Johnston 1984; Pienemann, Johnston & Brindley 1988, Pienemann 1989), then PT has expanded its typological validation from German and English to different languages, such as Swedish and other Scandinavian languages (H√•kansson 1997, Glahn et al. 2001), Arabic (e.g., Mansouri 1995; 2005), Italian (e.g. Di Biase & Kawaguchi 2002; Di Biase 2007; Bettoni, Di Biase & Nuzzo 2009), French (√Ögren 2009), Chinese (e.g. Zhang 2004, 2005), and Japanese (e.g. Di Biase & Kawaguchi 2002, 2005). Secondly, PT‚Äôs framework has been substantially widened by including Bresnan‚Äôs (2001) Lexical Mapping Theory, and thus adding a discourse pragmatically motivated syntactic component (Pienemann, Di Biase & Kawaguchi 2005) to its first syntactically motivated morphological module. Thirdly, developmentally- moderated transfer from L1 (e.g., Pienemann, Di Biase, Kawaguchi & H√•kansson 2005a; Pienemann, Di Biase, Kawaguchi & H√•kansson 2005b). Fourthly, PT‚Äôs plausibility has been tested in language situations other than L2 ones, such as monolingual and bilingual language acquisition (e.g., H√•kansson 2001, 2005; ItaniAdams 2006), among children with Specific Language Impairment (e.g., H√•kansson 2001; 2005), and in the origins of creole languages (Plag 2008a, 2008b). Finally, the range of the original applications of PT to language testing and language teaching has also expanded over the years, involving several new ways of testing and teaching situations (e.g., Iwasaki 2004, 2008, ask Bruno; Pienemann & Ke√üler 2007), and new languages (e.g. Di Biase 2008; Yamaguchi 2009). Ensuing publications in all these PT strands during such a long period of growth have had their own agendas and purposes. Furthermore, not only PT itself but also its feeder disciplines have developed in new directions, crucially among them psycholinguistics for language production and theoretical linguistics for language knowledge. As a consequence, it is not surprising that readers unfamiliar with PT's history may at times be confused by differences in the presentation of the theory, its use of terminology, and reliance on its theoretical bases.

Water depth is 190 feet (58 m). A fixed platform base under construction on a Louisiana river A fixed platform is a type of offshore platform used for the oil or gas. These platforms are built on concrete and/or steel legs anchored directly onto the seabed, supporting a deck with space for drilling rigs, production facilities and crew quarters. Such platforms are, by virtue of their immobility, designed for very long-term use. Various types of structure are used, steel jacket, concrete caisson, floating steel and even floating concrete. Steel jackets are vertical sections made of tubular steel members, and are usually piled into the seabed. Concrete caisson structures, pioneered by the Condeep concept, often have in-built oil storage in tanks below the sea surface and these tanks were often used as a flotation capability, allowing them to be built close to shore (Norwegian fjords and Scottish firths are popular because they are sheltered and deep enough) and then floated to their final position where they are sunk to the seabed. Fixed platforms are economically feasible for installation in water depths up to about 500 feet (150 m); for deeper depths a floating production system, or a subsea pipeline to land or to shallower water depths for processing, would usually be considered.

He was a member of a famous Anglo-Irish aristocratic family. Early life Charles Boyle was the son of Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Burlington, and his wife, Lady Elizabeth Clifford, 2nd Baroness Clifford suo jure, and was styled with the courtesy title of Viscount Dungarvan from birth. Career In 1663, Charles Boyle was called to the Irish House of Lords as Viscount Dungarvan and became a Fellow of the Royal Society the following year. From 1670 to 1679, Charles was Member of Parliament for Tamworth in the British House of Commons, and then for Yorkshire from 1679 onward. In 1682, he purchased the original Chiswick House which was a Jacobean house owned by Sir Edward Wardour. The house was used as a summer retreat by the Boyle family from their central London residence, Burlington House. In 1689, he was called to the British House of Lords for the Barony of Clifford of Lanesborough, which had been created for his father in 1644.

On the outbreak of the War, large fleets of battleships‚Äîmany inherited from the dreadnought era decades before‚Äîwere one of the decisive forces in naval thinking. By the end of the War, battleship construction was all but halted, and almost every remaining battleship was retired or scrapped within a few years of its end. Some pre-war commanders had seen the aircraft carrier as the capital ship of the future, a view which was reinforced by the devastating Pearl Harbor attack in 1941. The resultant Pacific War saw aircraft carriers and submarines take precedence. There were just two engagements in the Pacific Theater where battleships fought each other,The Pearl Harbor attack was a radical development of Japanese strategy that only occurred in 1941. It is also likely the American plan for the Pacific involved a prompt battleship engagement. Evans and Peattie, p.471-7 and only three such engagements in the Atlantic. Instead, they were used to add to fleet air defense, for shore bombardment, and in several cases as fixed port defense batteries. Battleships remained the most heavily protected ships afloat; nonetheless, sixteen were sunk or crippled by bombs or torpedoes delivered by aircraft, while three more were sunk by submarine-launched torpedoes.The battleships , , , , , , , , , , , , , Marat, and were all put out of commission or destroyed by aerial attack including bombs, air-dropped torpedoes and missiles fired from aircraft. The war also saw the development of the first guided bombs, which would make it much easier for aircraft to sink battleships in the future. Operations The German pre-dreadnought battleship fired the first shots of World War II with the bombardment of the Polish garrison at Westerplatte;Gibbons, p. 163 and the final surrender of the Japanese Empire took place aboard a United States Navy battleship . Between the two events, it became clear that battleships were now essentially irrelevant, and aircraft carriers were the new principal ships of the fleet. Still, battleships played a part in major engagements in Atlantic, Pacific and Mediterranean theatres. In the Atlantic, the Germans experimented with taking the battleship beyond conventional fleet action, using their pocket battleships as independent commerce raiders. Although there were a few battleship-on-battleship engagements, battleships had little impact on the destroyer and submarine Battle of the Atlantic, and aircraft carriers determined the outcome of most of the decisive fleet clashes of the Pacific War. In June 1940 and surprised and sank the lightly escorted aircraft carrier off western Norway Gibbons, pp. 246‚Äì247 This engagement marked the first and last time surface gunnery sank a fleet carrier. In the Attack on Mers-el- K√©bir, British capital ships opened fire on the French battleships harboured in Algeria with their own heavy guns, and the fleeing French ships were then pursued by planes from aircraft carriers.* Taranto and Matapan (1941) In late 1940 and 1941, a range of engagements saw battleships attacked by carrier aircraft. The first example of the power of naval aviation was the British air attack on the Italian naval base at Taranto that took place on the night of 11-12 November 1940. A small number of Royal Navy aircraft attacked the Italian fleet at harbour, succeeding in sinking one Italian battleship and damaging two others. Importantly, the attack forced the Italian navy to change tactics and seek battle against the superior British navy, which resulted in their defeat at the Battle of Cape Matapan. In that battle, British carrier- deployed torpedo bombers damaged an Italian battleship sufficiently to force it to withdraw from the main force, and then at night British battleships sank the Italian force's three heavy cruisers. Scharnhorst class The Scharnhorst class were the first capital ships, alternatively referred to as battlecruisers or battleships, built for Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine after World War I. The class comprised two vessels: the lead ship and . Scharnhorst was launched first, and so she is considered to be the lead ship by some sources; however, they are also referred to as the Gneisenau class in some other sources, as Gneisenau was the first to be laid down and commissioned. They marked the beginning of German naval rearmament after the Treaty of Versailles. The ships were armed with nine 28 cm (11 in) SK C/34 guns in three triple turrets, though there were plans to replace these weapons with six 38 cm (15 in) SK C/34 guns in twin turrets. Scharnhorst was sunk at the Battle of North Cape by a British force of destroyers, cruisers, and the battleship Duke of York. Gneisenau was bombed while in dry dock and never repaired. Bismarck The battleship war in the Atlantic was driven by the attempts of German capital ship commerce raiders--two battleships, the and the , and two battlecruisers--to influence the Battle of the Atlantic by destroying Atlantic convoys supplying the United Kingdom. The superior numbers of British surface units devoted themselves to protecting the convoys, and to seek-and- destroy missions against the German ships, assisted by both naval and land- based aircraft and by sabotage attacks. On 24 May 1941, during its attempt to break out into the North Atlantic as a commerce raider, Bismarck engaged the British battleship and the battlecruiser . Due in part to the Bismarcks superior range-finding and accuracy, it soon sank Hood with an apparent hit to her magazines. Bismarck and Prince of Wales hit each other three times, the damage compelling Prince of Wales to withdrawGibbons, pp. 228‚Äì229 and Bismarck to call off its commerce raiding operation, as part of its fuel reserve had been contaminated with salt water. While the Bismarck was heading for St. Nazaire, the Royal Navy continued to hunt it, and eventually an attack by Swordfish biplane torpedo bombers from the aircraft carrier disabled Bismarcks rudder and significantly reduced her speed. This enabled two Royal Navy battleships, cruisers and destroyers to close in for the kill. The Pacific battles (1915) leading battleship (1921) and cruisers (1930), (1932), and (1941) into Lingayen Gulf, Philippines, January 1945 In many of the crucial battles of the Pacific, for instance Coral Sea and Midway, battleships were either absent or overshadowed as carriers launched wave after wave of planes into the attack at a range of hundreds of miles. The primary tasks for battleships in the Pacific became shore bombardment and anti-aircraft defense for the carriers. The two largest battleships ever constructed, Japan's , which carried a main battery of nine 18.1-inch (460 millimetre) guns were designed to be a principal strategic weapon, but Yamato fired her main guns in only one engagement, while Musashi never fired her main guns in an engagement. They were hampered by technical deficiencies (slow battleships were incapable of operating with fast carriers), faulty military doctrine (the Japanese waited for a \\"decisive battle\\", which never came), and defective dispositions (as at Midway).Willmott, H.P. Barrier and the Javelin (Annapolis: USNIPress, 1983). =Pearl Harbor= Before hostilities broke out in the Pacific Theatre, extensive pre-war planning centered around dreadnoughts. The Royal Navy could not achieve parity with the estimated nine Japanese capital ships in Southeast Asia, since doing so would leave only a handful of ships to use against Nazi Germany. However, Prime Minister Winston Churchill was optimistic about the improving situation in the North Atlantic and Mediterranean and allocating two ships to the defense of Singapore was seen as a compromise. Furthermore, the U.S. Navy later agreed to send its Pacific Fleet with its eight powerful battleships to Singapore in the event of hostilities with Japan.The sinking of HMS Prince of Wales and HMS Repulse (Forcez- survivors.org) On 7 December 1941 the Japanese launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. Five out of eight U.S. battleships were quickly either sunk or sinking, with the rest seriously damaged (of those sunk two were total losses). The Japanese thus neutralized the U.S. battleship force in the Pacific by an air attack and showed the vulnerability to air attack of warships lying at anchor, as at Taranto. The loss of the battleships led the US Navy to rely on aircraft carriers as capital ships to make counterattacks against the Japanese, such as the Doolittle Raid in April 1942, and to engage Japanese naval forces at the Battle of the Coral Sea in May 1942 and the Battle of Midway in June 1942. The sinking of the British battleship and her escort, the battlecruiser , further demonstrated the vulnerability of a battleship to air attack, in this case while at sea without air cover. Both ships were on their way to assist in the defense of Singapore when Japanese land-based bombers and fighters found and sank them on 10 December 1941. Prince of Wales had the unwanted distinction of being the first modern battleship sunk by aircraft while underway and able to defend herself.Axell, Albert: Kamikaze, p. 14 =Midway= Commonly understood as a victory of carriers, Midway showed up deficiencies in Japanese operational planning. Yamamoto, considering his battleships the most valuable units, kept them far to the rear, in line with traditional practice. This placed them too far away to assist Nagumo (and they would have been too slow to keep up with him in any case). Yet, when Nagumo's carriers were sunk, Yamamoto lost an opportunity to salvage something. Carriers, for all their evident potency, were virtually defenseless at night, and Fletcher might have been dealt a crushing blow by Yamato the night of 6‚Äì7 June, had Yamamoto stayed closer.Willmott, Barrier and the Javelin, passim. =Guadalcanal= Initially, when the U.S. entered the war in December 1941, none of the nine Pacific Fleet battleships were available. One was being overhauled at Puget Sound Navy Yard from June 1941 until March 1942. Of the eight at Pearl Harbor, two were total losses and six had been sunk or crippled and were sent to West Coast shipyards for repair and reconstruction. With a top speed of only 21 knots, they would not have been able to keep up with the fleet carriers in any case. The new fast battleships of the and were still undergoing trials. North Carolina and South Dakota were ready by summer of 1942 and provided anti-aircraft defense during the Eastern Solomons and Santa Cruz Islands carrier battles. The Imperial Japanese Navy's (8 August 1940), seen in 1941, and her sister ship (1 November 1940) were the largest battleships in history. By contrast, the Imperial Japanese Navy had the advantage of a dozen operational battleships early in the war, but chose not to deploy them in any significant engagements. The two and two s, despite their extensive modernization and respectable speeds, were relegated to training and home defense, while the two and two were being saved due to fuel limitations for a \\"decisive battle\\", which never came. In fact, the only Japanese battleships to see much action in the early stages were the four s, which served mostly as carrier escorts due to their high speed and antiaircraft armament.Gibbons, pp. 262‚Äì263 U.S. fast battleships North Carolina and were available after the Battle of Midway and played key roles in defending U.S. carriers against air attacks, though North Carolina was temporarily put out of action by , which was credited with sinking escorting her. During the later part of the Guadalcanal campaign in fall 1942, Japan and the U.S. were both forced to commit their battleships to surface combat, due to the need to carry out night operations, and because of the exhaustion of their carrier forces. The Japanese used battleships a single time for shore bombardment, sending and against Henderson Field. In the most successful Japanese battleship action of the war,Stille, Cdr Mark (2008). Imperial Japanese Navy Battleships 1941‚Äì1945. p 19, Oxford: Osprey Publishing. this action killed 41 defenders and put the airfield out of action for about 12 hours. During the First Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, battleships and attempted a second bombardment of Henderson Field but were driven off by a force of U.S. cruisers and destroyers. Several USN ships were lost and others were crippled, but they inflicted critical damage on Hiei, which was abandoned after being subject to repeated air attacks that made salvage impossible. The following evening, at the Second Naval Battle of Guadalcanal on 15 November 1942, the United States battleships and fought and defeated a bombardment force centered around Kirishima, and though South Dakota was incapacitated early on by a faulty curcuit breaker and suffered moderate damage, Washington's accurate radar-directed dire fatally crippled Kirishima. =Leyte Gulf= Yamato (1940) under air attack, March 1945 By the time of the Battle of the Philippine Sea in 1944, heavy aircraft losses had left the Japanese carrier fleet ineffectual and forced the Japanese to finally commit their dreadnoughts, both old and new, to the upcoming Leyte Campaign. The objective in this \\"decisive battle\\" was to stop the Allies from capturing the Philippines, which would cut off the Japanese oil supply and render their navy useless. In the Battle of Leyte Gulf, two Japanese battleship forces converged on the American landing forces at Leyte Gulf. The Center Force of five fast battleships attacked from the north; the Southern Force of two slower old battleships attacked from the south. In the Battle of the Sibuyan Sea on 24 October 1944, the Center Force came under attack by American aircraft and , sister ship to Yamato, was sunk long before she could come within gun range of the American fleet. At the Battle of Surigao Strait early on 25 October, the Japanese Southern Force which included the battleships and encountered a force including six American battleships (five of them raised and repaired from Pearl Harbor), led by Admiral Jesse Oldendorf of the U.S. Seventh Fleet. Fus≈ç was sunk by torpedoes from US destroyers before the opposing battleships fired. Yamashiro was hit by the US battleships and retired without being able to fire on them. After the battleships had ceased fire she was sunk by a torpedo fired by a US destroyer.Tully, pp. 214‚Äì15 This engagement marked the last time in history when battleship faced battleship. In the Battle off Samar later on 25 October 1944, the remaining four powerful battleships of the Center Force, , , and and their cruiser escort, surprised and attacked the seemingly much weaker American task force \\"Taffy 3\\", consisting of destroyers, destroyer escorts, and escort carriers. American destroyers and aircraft attacked the battleships, enabling Taffy 3 to disengage and forcing the Center Force to withdraw, This battle marked the only time Yamato engaged enemy ships with her primary or secondary batteries. =Japanese Coast= During July and August 1945 several American battleships and conducted naval bombardments of several Japanese coastal cities. These attacks targeted major factories as well as the cities' harbors and nearby rail infrastructure.Morison (1960), pp. 312‚Äì316, 331‚Äì332 Soviet and Finnish battles Soviet battleship Marat (1914) moored in Gdynia prior to World War II. Marat was sunk in Kronstadt harbor by a 1,000 kg aerial bomb but three of four main turrets continued to operate against the invading Germans During the Soviet-Finnish Winter War, the Soviet battleships Marat and Oktyabrskaya Revolutsiya made several attempts to neutralize the Finnish coastal batteries to facilitate a full naval blockade. The Soviets inflicted little damage on the Finnish positions, and the defenders hit back, claiming at least one hit on Marat.Appel, Erik: Finland i krig 1939‚Äì1940, p. 182 During the German assault on the Soviet Union, the Soviet battleships served as convoy escorts during the evacuation of Tallinn, and as floating batteries during the siege of Leningrad.Linder, Jan: Ofredens hav, pp. 50‚Äì51 The dense German and Finnish minefields and the submarine nets effectively restricted Soviet traffic in the Gulf of Finland, forcing the larger vessels to remain at port.Brunila, Kai: Finland i krig 1940‚Äì1944, pp. 100‚Äì108, 220‚Äì225 The German Stuka pilot Hans-Ulrich Rudel eventually sank Marat at her moorings on 23 September 1941. Still, the vessel was able to serve as a battery for the remainder of the siege. The Soviets later refloated Marat and both it and Oktyabrskaya Revolutsiya served until the 1950s.Greger, Ren√©: Schlachtschiffe der Welt, pp. 201 Capabilities and tactics Fire support With the German capital-ship raiders sunk or forced to remain in port, shore bombardment became the focus of Allied battleships in the Atlantic. It was while covering the Allied invasion of Morocco that the fought and disabled Vichy French battleship on 27 October 1942. Six battleships came together as part of Operation Neptune, in support of the D-Day landings in June 1944. D-Day also saw the deliberate sacrifice of two old dreadnoughts ( and ), which were scuttled as part of the breakwater around the Allied Mulberry harbours. Aerial defense A kamikaze (just left of center near the top border), a Mitsubishi Zero in this case, about to hit the (1944) The sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse off the coast of Malaya in 1941 demonstrated that even the most modern battleships could not hold off aerial attacks without decent aerial defenses. The British HACS fire control system had been rendered inoperable by the extreme heat and humidity of the Malaya tropical climate, and the anti-aircraft artillery had managed to shoot down only a handful of attackers. An aircraft carrier's combat air patrol proved to be the most effective form of defense against enemy bombers. Nonetheless, a modern fast battleship could provide point defense against attackers that broke through the fighter screen. The North Carolina and South Dakota demonstrated just that in the battles of the Eastern Solomons and Santa Cruz Islands, respectively, with North Carolina downing between 7 and 14 planes, while South Dakota shot down between 26 and 32. The battleships' presence was crucial during these engagements in 1942, as the U.S. were still months from being able to realize their material advantage, with too few planes and ships to interdict enough of the skilled Japanese pilots. No American battleships were lost or seriously damaged by aerial attacks in open seas in World War II. By 1944, Admiral Raymond A. Spruance had arrayed his forces in a complex defense formation. The first line of protection was a radar-vectored combat air patrol, and any attackers who managed to get through would face anti- aircraft fire from a line of screening battleships and cruisers. This exacted such a heavy toll on the Japanese during the Battle of the Philippine Sea that they failed to cause any significant damage to their main targets, the aircraft carriers. The most damage that the Japanese caused was a bomb hit on South Dakota which caused many casualties but did little damage to the battleship.Battle of the Philippine Sea (CombinedFleet.com) =AA guns= At the outbreak of World War II, most battleships had large anti-aircraft batteries. The battleships used the same light AA guns (the Allies used autocannons such as the Bofors 40 mm gun and Oerlikon 20 mm cannon) as those on smaller ships, but in greater number. The later development of proximity fuses and radar vastly increased the effectiveness of these batteries. Oerlikon 20mm AA gun mount on board Post‚ÄìWorld War I battleships, particularly British and American, had discarded single purpose secondary batteries mounted in casemates used to engage surface targets in favour of turret-mounted dual purpose secondary batteries (5-inch or 6-inch caliber). Secondaries were initially designed to deal with rushing destroyers and torpedo boats, but there arose a need for heavy anti-aircraft armament as the potency of aircraft grew, particularly dive bombers and torpedo bombers. The rationale was that it is unlikely that a battleship would be simultaneously facing both destroyers and aircraft, but it would take up too much space to have separate types of guns to deal with both threats. Both weapons had similar calibers and so they could be merged into a single battery type, and the turret mountings were less susceptible to flooding and had a better firing arc than casemates. The space saved from combining the two types of guns added to simplification of supply, increased deck armor coverage, stowage of other equipment, more light anti- aircraft batteries, and other needs. The , incorporating many concepts from the G3 battlecruiser, was the first design to include a dual-purpose secondary battery, useful against both surface and airborne attacks. Compared to light AA they had a slower rate of fire, but they had a greater range and sufficient punch to knock enemy planes out of the sky. This proved a crucial defense against Japanese kamikazes in the latter years of World War II. They could also fire into the sea to create waterspouts that slapped low-flying torpedo bombers with tonnes of water. Battleships could mount many more of these DP batteries than cruisers or carriers. German vessels such as the Bismarck class possessed dedicated secondary anti-ship batteries as well as dedicated heavy anti-aircraft batteries, rather than adopting the dual-purpose secondaries like the British or Americans. Bismarck for instance had a battery of twelve 5.9 inch (150 mm) cannon and another sixteen 4.1 inch (105 mm) battery was mounted to deal with air threats. The cannon could be used against ships only, as they could not be elevated to fire on high-level targets. This tended to complicate ammunition supplies, take up more space, and reduce the numbers of both guns (reducing the anti-ship or anti-aircraft broadside). The Imperial Japanese Navy suffered similar problems to the Germans', as their secondaries were too slow to track aircraft.Japanese Naval Ordnance (CombinedFleet.com) The Japanese even used the \\"San Shiki\\" (the Beehive) Model 13 anti-aircraft shell for the main gun armament of the s, which would have in theory functioned as a super-sized \\"shotgun\\", though this was not considered a success. HMS Prince of Wales had one of the most advanced naval anti-aircraft systems of the time, the High Angle Control System, which demonstrated accurate long range radar directed AA fire during Operation Halberd in August and September 1941.The Royal Navy and the Mediterranean Convoys. A Naval Staff History, p26 However the extreme heat and humidity in Malayan waters in December of that year rendered her AA FC radars unserviceable and her 2 pounder ammunition had deteriorated as well.Battleship: The Loss of the Prince of Wales and the Repulse, Middlebrook Royal Air Force technicians were called in to examine the Prince's radars but did not have sufficient time to make the repairs, rendering her HACS ineffective.Alan Matthews, 2006, \\"The sinking of HMS Prince of Wales and HMS Repulse\\" (Force Z Survivors Association). Access date: 13 October 2007. =Armor= In the aftermath of the Battle of Jutland and post‚ÄìWorld War I era, designers began drawing up armor schemes that protected against ordnance dropped by aircraft or submarines. World War I ships fired at direct 90 degree trajectories. The introduction of high-angle battleship fire and plane bombings forced shipbuilders to consider adding significant armor to the top of battleships. The five ships of the American and es had considerably improved underwater hull protection over previous battleships, as the result of extensive experimentation and testing. The new class of Battleship was to include 40\\" of armored plating. The proposed G3 battlecruiser was planned to incorporate a thoroughly tested torpedo defense scheme, which was later used in the Nelson class. Not surprisingly, as many World War I battleships lacked such a protection system, they fared poorly against torpedoes, which in World War II were increasingly being delivered by submarines and aircraft. Battleships had an armored belt along the waterline. It was intended to stop shells that hit their sides and to prevent flooding by underwater explosions due to near misses. World War I battleship, German and Italian World War II battleships had lighter upper armored belts to protect sides up to the main or weather deck. Main belt thickness along the waterline ranged from 10\\" to 15\\", upper belt thickness ranged from 4\\" to 10\\". Most ships of the World War II period had a sloped main belt (internal in some classes), to increase resistance to incoming shells; and no upper belt, to save weight. Thicknesses of belt armor ranged from 10\\" for Strasbourg class - large battlecruisers rather than pure battleships - or from 12\\" South Dakota and Iowa classes) to 16\\" ().Gardner 1980, pp.98-99Gardner 1980, p.178 World War I ships had a light upper armored deck to protect the secondary guns and a main armored deck whose sides sloped down to meet the lower edge of the belt, but their thickness was usually no more than 1.5\\", or 2\\" for the slopes. As soon as long-range engagements became common and aerial threats increased, crash programs to improve deck and turret roof protection started. US Navy \\"all-or- nothing\\" armor layout introduced a flat heavy armor deck, which abutted the upper edges of the armored belt, and light armored weather and lower decks: this design was used by all World War II ships except Reichsmarine units, that kept a heavier lower deck and a lighter upper deck. Main deck armor thickness ranged from 4\\" to 6\\" or even 9\\" for , usually increased over magazines: lighter decks were 1.5\\" to 2\\" thick. From the lessons of Jutland, the protection scheme incorporated a sophisticated torpedo defense system (TDS).Best Battleship: Underwater Protection (CombinedFleet.com) By adopting a turbo-electric drive, this allowed a wholesale rearrangement and close subdivision of the machinery spaces, while simultaneously narrowing them and permitting more space outboard for a layered system of voids, liquid-filled tanks and thin armored bulkheads.A Survey of the American \\"Standard Type\\" Battleship (navweaps.com) By contrast, \\"thin-skinned\\" cruisers and carriers relied only on numerous compartments to prevent flooding from spreading. Some were upgraded with anti-torpedo blisters, though these were much inferior to the battleship's armored belt. During the Pearl Harbor attack, TDS and damage control counterflooding saved West Virginia from nine torpedo hits, while , which lacked it, capsized after just three. For the Attack on Pearl Harbor the JNAF adapted 16\\" shells from s into an aerial bomb specifically designed to penetrate the deck armor of the American battleships. It was one of these weapons, dropped from a Nakajima B5N level bomber, which resulted in the destruction of the .Note: This weapon was called 800 kg armor-piercing bomb Type 99, No 80, Mark 5. The development of this bomb is described in At Dawn We Slept.Prange, Gordon W. At Dawn We Slept: The untold story of Pearl Harbor. New York, USA: McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1981. p.161. During the attack on , according to a PBS documentary, U.S. torpedo bombers were taught to aim for either the bow or the stern, where the protective belt did not extend. For torpedo bombers to make their runs successfully, fighters strafed the battleship to suppress AA guns, and dive bombers wreaked havoc on the upper decks, destroying AA weapons and fire control systems. Pilots were also instructed to focus on one side of the ship, causing massive flooding which was difficult to counteract, leading to the ship capsizing. A bow hit was deadly, since the onrushing water from the battleship's high speed could wrench the hole open wider and collapse compartment bulkheads, which was why Yamatos sister, , foundered at Sibuyan Sea.The Loss of Battleship KONGO: As told in Chapter \\"November Woes\\" of \\"Total Eclipse: The Last Battles of the IJN - Leyte to Kure 1944 to 1945\\". (CombinedFleet.com) The stern attacks are best demonstrated by the cases of Bismarck and Prince of Wales; the rudders and screws were similarly vulnerable. Fleet Air Arm planned to release their armor-piercing bombs from above a certain height so they would penetrate Tirpitzs thick armor during Operation Tungsten.Best Battleship: Armor (CombinedFleet.com) As the British pilots did not release their ordnance from the optimal altitude, Tirpitz suffered extensive damage to her upperworks but her deck armor remained intact.Tirpitz: The History (www.bismarck- class.dk/tirpitz/history/tiropertungsten.html) While the suicide air attacks-- the so-called kamikaze--struck many U.S. battleships, none were seriously damaged due to their thick armor. Kamikaze were much more successful against lesser-armored ships.Axell, Albert: Kamikaze, pp. 205‚Äì213 There were limits to the battleship's protection scheme, since it could not keep pace with the faster pace of developments in ordnance. For instance, the TDS in the South Dakota and s were designed to absorb the energy from an underwater explosion equivalent to 700 pounds (317 kg) of TNT -- the Navy's best guess in the 1930s about Japanese weapons. But unbeknownst to U.S. Naval Intelligence, the Japanese 24-inch (60 cm) Type 93 torpedo, carried a charge equivalent to 891 pounds (405 kg) of TNT. And no amount of armor that could be practically incorporated would have saved the from the massive 12,000 lb (5.4t) Tallboys dropped by RAF Lancaster bombers during Operation Catechism.Tamelander, Michael: Slagskeppet TirpitzJacobsen, Alf R.: D√∂dligt angrepp Notably a Tallboy bomb that hit Tirpitz amidships between the aircraft catapult and the funnel blew a massive hole into the ship's side and bottom, destroying the entire section of belt armour abreast of the bomb hit, which caused significant flooding and contributed to the ship's rapid list and eventual capsizing. =Coordination and waves= In a well-planned attack, fighter planes strafed the battleship to suppress the AA guns, while dive bombers used their armor-piercing bombs to cause topside damage and havoc. The fighters and dive bombers, however, were diversions to allow the delivery of aerial torpedoes. Battleships were able to sustain more punishment and had fewer vulnerable spots than cruisers and carriers, so it was difficult to rely upon scoring a critical hit (the cases of the Bismarck and Prince of Wales are considered exceptional). Instead, the way to defeat battleships was by attrition, by overwhelming them with repeated waves of attacks inflicting accumulating damage. This is best demonstrated at the Battle of Leyte Gulf; at the Sibuyan Sea where the super-dreadnought eventually succumbed to her damage, after being beset by waves of U.S. carrier aircraft and with her being the primary focus of their attacks. The U.S. planes would have accomplished less if they spread out to attack the rest of the ships in Kurita's powerful force. By contrast, the 24 October air attack on Nishimura's southern pincer did little damage, even though both of his s were slow World War I-era dreadnoughts and his force had far fewer screening ships, as he only faced a single wave from U.S. carriers and . =Innovative Attacks= The Axis Powers implemented some unconventional methods. The Italians used with success their tested method of having frogmen delivering explosive charges to the ships, managing to severely damage and to a lesser extent in the shallow waters of the harbor of Alexandria, putting Valiant out of action until mid-1942 and Queen Elizabeth until mid-1943. Other more or less successful Italian methods included manned torpedoes and small motor assault boats, which were filled with explosives, aimed at the target, sped up to full speed, while the pilot catapulted himself out from the dashing craft.Taylor, A. J. P.: 1900-talet, p. 139 The Germans developed a series of stand-off weapons, e.g., the guided bomb Fritz X, which scored some early successes. On 9 September 1943, the Germans managed to sink the Italian battleship and severely damage her sister ship, the Italia, while they were underway to surrender. The first one hit Roma amidship between 90 mm AA gun mounts, piercing deck and side, then exploded, halving her speed; the other one hit above deck between turret #2 and the conning tower. It caused an explosion that threw the turret overboard and affected the boilers, starting a major fire that detonated the main magazines. 1,353 lives were lost; only 596 survivors, most badly burned, were rescued. Among those killed was the Italian Commander in Chief of Naval Battle Forces, Admiral Carlo Bergamini. One week later, the Germans scored another hit on the British battleship . The bomb penetrated six decks before exploding against the bottom of the ship, blowing a large hole in her. The ship took in a total of 5,000 tonnes of water, lost steam (and thus all power, both to the ship herself and to all her systems), and had to be taken in tow. She reached Malta but was out of action for the next 12 months.Ireland, Bernard: Jane's War at Sea, pp. 190‚Äì191 The British further developed their ability to sink battleships in harbour with minisubs and very heavy bombs dropped by strategic bombers. The last active German battleship, , lurked until late into the war in Norwegian fjords protected by anti-submarine weapons and shore based anti-aircraft guns. She was severely damaged in September 1943 during Operation Source, a daring covert attack by British mini-subs. After several air strikes, including Operation Tungsten, which was made with carrier aircraft, Tirpitz was finally sunk in harbour by RAF heavy bombers carrying massive Tallboy bombs. During that action, codenamed Operation Catechism, two of the bombs penetrated her armor, one holing her portside and the other starting a fire that eventually detonated her magazines and blew off her Caesar turret, causing her to capsize and killing 1,000 of the 1,700 men aboard.

The uniformly warm waters that make up 81% of Indonesia's area ensure that temperatures on land remain fairly constant, with the coastal plains averaging 28 ¬∞C, the inland and mountain areas averaging 26 ¬∞C, and the higher mountain regions, 23 ¬∞C. Temperature varies little from season to season, and Indonesia experiences relatively little change in the length of daylight hours from one season to the next; the difference between the longest day and the shortest day of the year is only forty-eight minutes. This allows crops to be grown all year round. The main variable of Indonesia's climate is not temperature or air pressure, but rainfall. The area's relative humidity ranges between 70 and 90%. Winds are moderate and generally predictable, with monsoons usually blowing in from the south and east in June through September and from the northwest in December through March. Typhoons and large-scale storms pose little hazard to mariners in Indonesian waters; the major danger comes from swift currents in channels, such as the Lombok and Sape straits. Indonesia experiences a number of climates, mostly tropical rainforest (highest precipitation), followed by tropical monsoon and tropical savanna (lowest precipitation). However, oceanic climates and subtropical highland climates are found in a number of high-altitude regions in Indonesia, mostly between above sea level. Regions that are above this level (mostly in the Papuan highlands) fall into the tundra climate category and the subpolar oceanic category. Monsoons The extreme variations in rainfall are linked with the monsoons. Generally speaking, there is a dry season (June to October), influenced by the Australian continental air masses, and a rainy season (November to March) that is caused by Asia and Pacific Ocean air masses. Local wind patterns, however, can greatly modify these general wind patterns, especially in the islands of central Maluku‚ÄîSeram, Ambon, and Buru. This oscillating annual pattern of wind and rain is related to Indonesia's geographical location as an isthmus between two large continents. In September and May, high pressure over the Gobi desert moves winds from that continent toward the northwest. As the winds reach the equator, the Earth's rotation causes them to veer off their original course in a northeasterly direction toward the Southeast Asian mainland. During January and February, a corresponding low pressure system over Asia causes the pattern to reverse. The result is a monsoon which is augmented by humid breezes from the Indian Ocean, producing significant amounts of rain throughout many parts of the Malay Archipelago. See also monsoon trough. Prevailing winds Prevailing wind patterns interact with local topographic conditions to produce significant variations in rainfall throughout the archipelago. In general, western and northern parts of Indonesia experience the most precipitation, since the north- and westward-moving monsoon clouds are heavy with moisture by the time they reach these more distant regions. Western Sumatra, Java, Bali, the interiors of Kalimantan, Sulawesi, and Papua are the most predictably damp regions of Indonesia, with rainfall measuring more than per year. In part, this moisture originates on high mountain peaks that trap damp air. The city of Bogor, near Jakarta, lays claim to having the world's highest number of thunderstorm days per year‚Äî322. On the other hand, the islands closest to Australia‚Äîincluding Nusa Tenggara and the eastern tip of Java‚Äîtend to be dry, with some areas experiencing less than per year. To complicate the situation, some of the islands of the southern Malukus experience highly unpredictable rainfall patterns, depending on local wind currents. Temperature Although air temperature changes little from season to season or from one region to the next, cooler temperatures prevail at higher elevations. In general, temperatures drop approximately 1 ¬∞C per 90-meter increase in elevation from sea level with some high-altitude interior mountain regions experiencing night frosts. The highest mountain ranges in Papua are permanently capped with snow.

He was educated at Felsted and Trinity College, Cambridge, and worked in advertising and in sponsored documentaries before becoming a commercials producer at Moving Picture Company (MPC). In the buildup to the launch of Channel 4 in November 1982, he formed MPC's programme department, executive producing a number of documentary series for the new channel, including one of its earliest hits Tom Keating on Painters. He also produced several television films for the Film on Four strand, including Last Day of Summer, written by Ian McEwan from his own short story, and The House, the debut drama from writer-director and People Show alumnus Mike Figgis. He moved on to feature films in the mid-80s, including The Assam Garden, in which Deborah Kerr gave a highly acclaimed performance in what would be her last feature, and Stormy Monday, in which Mike Figgis made an immediate impact as writer and director of his first. In 1988, Stafford-Clark moved to Zenith Productions, the independent drama production company whose feature film credits included Prick Up Your Ears, Wish You Were Here, Sid and Nancy and The Hit, and whose television productions included Inspector Morse and Hamish Macbeth. During his time there he produced a number of television and feature films, amongst them the highly controversial and award-winning Shoot to Kill (1990), the drama debut of documentary film-maker Peter Kosminsky, which told the story of the Stalker Inquiry in Northern Ireland. In 1998 Stafford-Clark left Zenith to form his own production company, Deep Indigo, winning the British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Serial three times between 1999 and 2005 with productions for the BBC. Warriors (1999), written by Leigh Jackson, reunited him with director Peter Kosminsky and dealt with the brutal realities facing young British soldiers on peacekeeping duties in Bosnia. The Way We Live Now (2001), the first of three projects with writer Andrew Davies, was directed by David Yates and starred David Suchet as Anthony Trollope's rogue Augustus Melmotte. This was followed by a second Trollope adaptation He Knew He Was Right (2003) directed by Tom Vaughan, and then by Bleak House (2005). This eight-hour adaptation of the novel by Charles Dickens was shown in the UK twice weekly in half-hour episodes (after an initial hour), inspired by the episodic publication of the original novel. It was directed by Justin Chadwick and Susanna White, with Gillian Anderson and Charles Dance leading a cast of over 65. In March 2008 Stafford-Clark's production The Passion was broadcast on BBC One. It told the story of Jesus from his entry into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday to his Crucifixion and the events which followed. Written by Frank Deasy and directed by Michael Offer, it was stripped across Holy Week in four peak-time episodes. More recently Stafford-Clark produced Titanic, a four-hour serial for ITV in the UK written by Julian Fellowes, that took a fresh look at the sinking of the Titanic for the one hundredth anniversary in April 2012. Filming was completed in mid-July 2011 at the Stern Studios in Budapest. The UK/Hungary/Canada co-production was sold to 160 countries, including the ABC Network in the USA, TF1 in France and ZDF in Germany, and won the 2013 British Academy Television Award for Best Visual Effects. His most recent production is Press, a six part drama series for BBC One and PBS Masterpiece Theatre, written by Mike Bartlett (Dr Foster, King Charles III) and directed by Tom Vaughan.

The removal is achieved by injecting gas bubbles into the water or wastewater in a flotation tank or basin. The small bubbles adhere to the suspended matter causing the suspended matter to float to the surface of the water where it may then be removed by a skimming device. Induced gas flotation is very widely used in treating the industrial wastewater effluents from oil refineries, petrochemical and chemical plants, natural gas processing plants and similar industrial facilities. A very similar process known as dissolved air flotation is also used for waste water treatment. Froth flotation is commonly used in the processing of mineral ores. IGF units in the oil industry do not use air as the flotation medium due to the explosion risk. These IGF units use natural gas or nitrogen to create the bubbles. Process description The feed water to the IGF float tank is often (but not always) dosed with a coagulant (such as ferric chloride or aluminum sulfate) to flocculate the suspended matter. The bubbles may be generated by an impeller, eductors or a sparger. The bubbles adhere to the suspended matter, causing the suspended matter to float to the surface and form a froth layer which is then removed by a skimmer. The froth-free water exits the float tank as the clarified effluent from the IGF unit. Some IGF unit designs utilize parallel plate packing material to provide more separation surface and therefore to enhance the separation efficiency of the unit.

Built about 1765, it is one of Windsor's largest and most elaborate Georgian brick houses. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972, and is a contributing property to the Palisado Avenue Historic District, listed in 1987. It is owned and operated by the Windsor Historic Society, which offers tours on a year-round basis. Description and history The Hezekiah Chaffee House stands on the east side of the Palisado Green, Windsor's earliest settlement area just north of the Farmington River. It is a large two-story brick structure, with a gambrel roof and central chimney. The brick is laid in Flemish bond, and the house stands on a foundation of red sandstone. There are two gambrel-roofed ells, 1-1/2 stories in height, extending to the south and northeast. They appear to be contemporaneous to the main block, sharing a similar foundation. The main facade is five bays wide, with a center entrance topped by a five-light transom window. It is sheltered by a later Greek Revival portico, with a pedimented gable and Doric columns. The house was built c. 1765 for Dr. Hezekiah Chaffee, who had bought the land in 1755. It remained in the Chaffee family until 1926, when it was acquired by the Loomis Institute, then a boys prep school, to house a girls school known as the Chaffee School. The two schools are now united on a different campus as the Loomis Chaffee School. The house is now run as a museum property by the Windsor Historical Society and is open year-round, Wednesday - Saturday from 11 am to 4 pm.

As a result of his fine features and long hair he is often mistaken for a girl at first glance, even receiving the nickname . His appearance was revealed to have been inherited from his late mother, Miyo. Despite this, he is otherwise a rather normal, though somewhat aloof and standoffish, boy. Born into a well-known Kabuki family, his persistent yearning for the skies has made for a thorny relationship with his father, who has disowned him. He constantly frets about living aboard Macross Frontier due to the lack of a true 'sky'. After getting the chance to pilot the VF-25 Messiah variable fighter (due to its original pilot, Henry Gilliam, being killed by a large type Vajra in the first episode) his flying skills draw the attention of Ozma Lee, who accepts him as a candidate for the S.M.S. Skull Platoon. When S.M.S. grows suspicious of Leon and break away from the Frontier fleet, Alto remains as one of the few S.M.S. members who stay behind on Frontier. He later joins the N.U.N.S. forces and is assigned to the 4th Fighter Wing as squad leader (3 fighters) with call sign Sagittarius-1. As a result, he is given a new VF-171EX variable fighter. After being told by Leon Mishima that Ranka may become a tool for the Vajra in their war against humanity, Alto vows to kill her if necessary to save the Macross Frontier fleet. He is presumed dead after his VF-171EX is destroyed by Brera Sterne's VF-27 during the initial stages of the final battle between the Macross Frontier fleet and the Vajra. However, Alto reveals he had ejected from the VF-171EX before it was shot down. He resumes the fight in his original VF-25 Messiah, stopping Grace O'Connor with Michel's sniper rifle while being aided by Brera, who had broken free from Grace's control. As the Frontier fleet lands on the Vajra home planet, he ejects from his damaged VF-25 in his EX- Gear, giving the fighter a final salute as he fulfills his dream of flying in a real sky. He is last shown flying over Ranka and Sheryl at the Vajra planet. :As part of the 25th Anniversary Tribute, Alto is shown mimicking scenes from the previous Macross series: :*The scene where Alto saves Ranka for the first time is a nod to when Hikaru Ichijyo rescues Lynn Minmay. :*While controlling his VF-25 in slave mode, he uses the same flying hand motion as Isamu Alva Dyson. :*His salute to both girls in the final episode is a nod to a similar scene in The Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Do You Remember Love?. :*When his fighter is rising to the surface to be launched, that scene and the one in which Alto raises his head is very similar to those shown in the opening of the original Macross when Hikaru and his Valkyrie rise to the surface. ; : :*Age: 16Macross Frontier (TV Series). Macross Frontier Official Site. Story Section. Story List. Episode 04. 04-24-08 :Known as the , Ranka is a petite, lively and cheerful (although naive) teenage girl with green hair. She suffers from post-traumatic stress syndrome as a result from witnessing the destruction of the 117th Long Distance Research Fleet in which her biological family perished. She is one-quarter Zentradi, which gives her the ability to have her hair move on its own according to her feelings, as well as an above- average resistance to the vacuum of space. As the adopted younger sister of S.M.S. ace Ozma Lee, she initially attends an all-girl's high school at the urging of her brother while working part-time at the Chinese restaurant \\"Nyan- Nyan\\". She later transfers to the Mihoshi Academy to facilitate her singing career after being discovered at the Miss Macross contest and the \\"Bird Human\\" movie where she plays the role of Mao Nome. Ranka starts off as a huge fan of Sheryl Nome as she has loved singing since childhood and had dreamt of becoming a singer. She has a crush on Alto Saotome, especially after being rescued by him when the Vajra first attacked the Macross Frontier fleet. It is revealed that she has a deep connection to the Vajra as her songs confuse them and she feels severe pain whenever large amounts of Vajra are killed in her vicinity; the exact nature of this ability is explained as the result of her mother's exposure to the \\"V-Type\\" infection during pregnancy. As such, Ranka is referred to as the \\"Little Queen\\" by Grace O'Connor, suggesting that her relation to the Vajra may be more than it seems. In episode 21, with her heart completely broken, she leaves the Macross Frontier fleet (along with her bodyguard Brera Sterne) while trying to deliver her Vajra pet \\"Ai-Kun\\" to the rest of its species. She and Brera eventually find the planet of origin of the Vajra. Ranka is captured by them just as she recalls her past and realizes that Brera is her biological brother. While being held on the Vajra planet, she realizes that everything that happened to the 117th fleet resulted because her singing attracted the Vajra. Using Ranka's self-perceived blame for the incident, Grace O'Connor manipulates Ranka into compromising the Vajra fold communication network, allowing Grace to send the Vajra against the incoming Macross Frontier fleet during their final battle. However, with the help of Alto, Sheryl, and Brera, she manages to break free from Grace's influence and rallies the Vajra to side with the Frontier fleet to defeat Grace. In the last episode Ranka saves the life of Sheryl from the \\"V-type\\" microbes that she had, sending from her brain into her abdomen. In the final scene, she is seen welcoming Alto to the Vajra's home planet, as he flies over to her and Sheryl. :Ranka shares many characteristics with Lynn Minmay of the original Macross series. Both characters started out working in a Chinese restaurant and both participated in a local beauty pageant (with the exception that Minmay won the Miss Macross pageant while Ranka finished as a runner-up in the Miss Macross Frontier pageant). ; :, singing voice: May'n :*Age: 17 :Known as the \\"Galactic Fairy\\", Sheryl Nome is a pop idol from Macross Galaxy fleet who constantly tops music charts, leading people to say that it was impossible not to hear her songs if you lived in this galaxy. As such, her popularity was soaring just as high in the Galaxy's sister fleet, Macross Frontier. Due to her beauty and singing talent, she is a very proud and self-assured person. Sheryl recognizes the singing talent of Ranka Lee and often offers to help her 'behind the scenes' to realize her dream of singing. Sheryl's first encounter with Alto Saotome occurs when he serves as a backup 'performer' at her first concert in Frontier. It is later revealed that Sheryl is apparently a failed experimental subject called Fairy 9 and is \\"discarded\\" by Grace O'Connor on Galia 4, the latter stating that she had outlived her usefulness. However, Sheryl survives and makes her way back to Frontier together with Michael in his VF-25G. Confronting Grace O'Connor for sabotaging her career, she is reminded that she used to be an anonymous and homeless orphan girl living in Galaxy's slums, where Grace picked her up for the Fairy 9 project. Grace also reveals that Sheryl is suffering from a terminal \\"V-Type\\" infection and will soon die in the absence of a cure. Crushed by the revelation, she almost quits singing altogether if not for Alto's encouragement and the desperation brought on by a vicious Vajra assault on Frontier. While Sheryl is singing for a charity concert, Luca Angelloni discovers that her infection gives her similar abilities to those of Ranka Lee in producing fold waves through her singing, albeit to a lesser extent. Leon's administration immediately seeks her help, instantly resurrecting her singing career for the final assault against the Vajra. A letter and photograph written by Mao Nome's daughter is found by Cathy Glass in the remains of the 117th Research and Exploration Fleet and confirms Sheryl Nome is in fact Dr. Mao Nome's biological granddaughter, her fold quartz earrings inherited from Mao. The series hints that her mother fell on hard times shortly after the death of her grandmother. During the final battle, Ranka Lee cures Sheryl's infection by sending the \\"V-Type\\" microbes from her brain into her abdomen, resulting in Sheryl having the same capability as Ranka to link up with the Vajra through singing. Sheryl joins Ranka in rallying the Vajra to side with the Frontier fleet and defeat Grace. :The prequel manga reveals that her parents were residents of the Macross Galaxy who were opposed to mandatory cybernetic implants by the government and were ordered to be either executed or captured by the authorities under the cause of treason. Her parents were both killed for their resistance and Sheryl spend a part of childhood living in poverty until she met Grace O'Connor, during that time she met Lylith Amagi, the daughter of the Amagi family who competed with the Saotome family as famous Kabuki actors, but was disowned after her father's second wife gave birth to a son. Like many disowned children of the aristocracy, Lylith was enrolled into Erato Academy, where she taught Sheryl that she must stop burdening her natural talent with feelings of sorrow as they affected her singing skills. During a major audition for the lead role in an upcoming musical, Sheryl's singing abilities attracts Vajra, which Grace took a notice to. Lylith sacrificed herself to save Sheryl, telling Sheryl that her songs must convey feelings to others; Sheryl promises to Lylith and her parents that she will be the best singer in the galaxy. During her time as a student in Erato, Sheryl unwittingly met Alto Saotome as a Kabuki actor on stage, making their destiny entwined since then.

Skull Platoon and pilots a blue VF-25G (gunner/sniper version). He initially expresses doubt over Alto joining the Skull Platoon, but later accepts him. :Michael is also one of the most observant characters, noticing the love triangle between Alto, Ranka, and Sheryl as well as catching on to Grace's insidious plot behind the scenes. He is a childhood friend of Klan Klang and have liked her for a long time, although it is not clear whether he knows that their feelings are mutual. He chose to hide his feelings regardless, since he believes that as a soldier who always has to put his life on the line, confessing such feelings would only bring pain. He nonetheless reciprocated after Klan eventually confessed to him, only to be stabbed by a stage 2 Vajra later while saving her from a Vajra assault in the S.M.S. micronization/macronization chamber, after which his body is sucked into space via a hole and is never found.Macross Frontier (TV Series).

He is often frustrated with his seniors, who like to give him a hard time. He is a genius with computers and military electronics. As with Michael, he is a member of the S.M.S. Skull Platoon. He pilots a green RVF-25 (reconnaissance version). His fighter is custodied by three pet Ghost Drones (which he calls Shimon, Johanne, and Petero, or Simon, John, and Peter) that respond to his verbal commands. He is also the heir to the L.A.I. corporation, which means he has access to exotic, prototype technologies and is somewhat involved in Grace and Leon's plans. It is also strongly hinted that he has a crush on his classmate Nanase Matsuura. :After Nanase is injured and Michael is killed due to the Vajra attack inside the Frontier, Luca, together with Alto, joins the New U.N. Spacy as part of the 4th Fighter Wing and vows to destroy the Vajra. He flies the new Recon version of the VF-171EX until the final battle with the Vajra, when he switches to his original RVF-25 and with Klan Klang tows Alto's VF-25 to him. During the final battle, Luca disengages the A.I. limiters on his Ghost drones to counter Macross Galaxys V-9 Ghost attack drones. While the drones are eventually destroyed, they succeed in covering Alto to complete the mission. After the fleet lands on the Vajra homeworld, he is seen rushing to Nanase Matsuura bedside as she awakens from her injuries. ; : :Another classmate of Alto, Michael, and Luca, Nanase is also Ranka Lee's friend. A shy, quiet and voluptuous girl with glasses, she also works in the same \\"Nyan-Nyan\\" restaurant as Ranka and supports her dream of becoming a singer. Nanase is a skilled artist and was hired by Grace to become Ranka's costume designer. She is severely wounded in her right eye and other parts of her body during a Vajra attack inside Macross Frontier. Sheryl Nome takes her into a shelter for medical attention, thus saving her life. However, due to the injuries she goes into a coma and did not reawaken until the Frontier fleet lands on the Vajra homeworld. Private Military Provider S.M.S. (Strategic Military Services) ; : :The middle-aged top ace in the S.M.S. private military company and leader of Skull Platoon, he holds the rank of Major and is an experienced former N.U.N.S. pilot. He is an avid fan of Fire Bomber and often plays their songs in his car or while at home, and also names Skull Platoon's battle formations after their songs (i.e., \\"Planet Dance\\", \\"Totsugeki Love Heart\\"). Although laid-back, short-tempered, and careless on the outside, he knows when to be serious, and believes that the real duty of a soldier is to care for his subordinates and civilians, thus making him more reliable than he actually looks. He is somewhat overprotective of his \\"sister\\" (legally, his adopted daughter) Ranka Lee, and lies to her about his work so she will not worry about him, telling her he has a desk job in a company's personnel department. He is actually unrelated to Ranka by blood and is only her adopted brother, constantly blaming himself for failing to protect her family during a Vajra attack on the 117th Large Scale Research Fleet eleven years ago. He also had a prior romantic relationship with NUNS 2nd Lt. Catherine \\"Cathy\\" Glass sometime in the past, which makes their current working relationship on Macross Quarter a little tense at times. Like Cathy Glass, Ozma had grown suspicious of Leon Mishima's intentions and confronted him only to be arrested by his men. However, he and Cathy escape and find the body of president Howard Glass after Leon had him killed inside Battle Frontier. He and Cathy are found by Bobby and return to the Macross Quarter to tell the truth about Howard Glass' death. Ozma learns that Ranka has left the Frontier fleet to recover her memories and decides that he must also choose his own path. When S.M.S. resorts to piracy and separates from the Frontier fleet in the Macross Quarter, Ozma battles Alto and, before joining the Macross Quarter in its fold jump, tells Alto (whom he has many misgiving due to Alto's at-times rebellious piloting behavior) that he has improved and reminds him to choose his own path. He was one of the primary investigators at Galia 4, where the Macross Quarter uncovers the truth behind the Vajra and the corrupted factions in both the Galaxy and Frontier fleets. After Macross Quarter rendezvous with the Frontier fleet during the final battle, he joins the fray and fires nuclear missiles at Grace. However, the missiles prove ineffective against Grace, who having compromised the Vajra queen now wields an impenetrable super-dimension energy shield. Eventually he manages to cover Alto so he can kill Grace. In the closing scene, he is seen to be back with Cathy as the Frontier fleet settles on the Vajra home planet. He drives a Lancia Delta. :Ozma Lee shares many characteristics with Roy Focker from the original Macross series. In episode 17, Ozma is seriously wounded after a fierce battle with the Vajra, but conceals his wounds while watching Ranka's debut concert with Cathy until he loses consciousness from severe blood loss. However, unlike Focker, who died in episode 18 of the original series due to a similar injury, Ozma is rushed to the hospital, where he survives. Both characters even make references to pineapple-based desserts in their situations (salad for Focker; cake for Ozma). ; : :The middle-aged First lieutenant in the S.M.S. and the pilot of Skull Team's VB-6 K√∂nig Monster variable bomber. Although she rarely speaks, when she does her words have great weight and she often advises Ozma. Canaria also serves as a military medic for S.M.S. She is married and has a young son named Eddie. Canaria leaves them at Frontier after departing with Ozma and the rest of the S.M.S. deserters. During the climatic battle against the Vajra she flies her VB-6 K√∂nig Monster into the flight deck of Battle Galaxy and fires with the rail cannons and missiles at its bridge, blinding the enemy ship long enough for the Macross Quarter to destroy its Macross Cannon and enabling the Battle Frontier to destroy the Battle Galaxy ship by itself. ;Official Romanization of „ÇØ„É©„É≥„Éª„ÇØ„É©„É≥ (Klan Cang) Retrieved on 07-02-09. : :A blue-haired, stern-looking, but well-endowed Zentradi female (Meltran) who is the commander of the all-female S.M.S.

Klan is a childhood friend of Michael Blanc and harbors a crush on him that does not seem to be reciprocated. She is an ace Queadluun-Reapower-armor pilot. Due to a genetic anomaly when she is micronized she physically appears to be a child. This makes her the perfect target for Michael's mockery.

Michael's last words are a declaration of his love for her and an apology for waiting to tell her until it was too late. When the Macross Quarter deserts the Frontier fleet, Klan is one of those who stay behind, saluting the ship as it launches past her. During the final battle, her Quaedluun-Rea is critically damaged by Brera Sterne, but she springs back into action in Michael's VF-25G while in micronized form, trumping her sniping skills. In the climatic confrontation with Grace, her VF is damaged while covering Alto, so she entrusts him with Michael's sniper rifle. Alto uses the weapon to deliver the kill shot at Grace. ; : :A tall (by Zentradi standards) pink-haired Meltran who is part of the all-female S.M.S. Pixie Platoon.

A colonel in the S.M.S. ranks, he used to be a pilot in an U.N. Forces aircraft carrier early on his career. A seasoned veteran, he has a beard and a horizontal scar across his face as proof of his previous combat experience. Though a very polite officer, he can become highly mischievous when the situation requires it. It is mentioned that he lost his wife some time ago. When he receives an order from Richard Bilrer that the S.M.S. would be disbanded and then reincorporated into the N.U.N.S. (just as he learned the truth regarding President Glass' death from Cathy and Ozma) Wilder declares that the S.M.S. are now pirates instead of soldiers and successfully convinces the other S.M.S. members (excluding Clan, Nene, Alto and Luca among some others) to join them. He then commands the Macross Quarter to detach itself from the Frontier and go into a fold jump. After he and his crew investigated the truth behind the Vajra attacks by reviewing the evidence from the wrecks of the 117th fleet, he realizes that Grace O'Connor plans to force humanity into becoming like the Vajra living in a linked mind network with O'Connor as its Queen. Now with knowledge of the truth behind the conflict Wilder filed a report to the government on Earth and took his ship to the Vajra home planet to help stop the conflict between humanity and the aliens. He also asks Monica Lange if she will stand with him when they go to confront Leon and the Vajra, showing that he knew her feelings for him and that he shared them too. Captain Wilder brings Macross Quarter back to the Vajra homeworld and presents evidence of Leon's involvement in the assassination of President Glass and his working with the true enemy, the co-conspirators from Macross Galaxy fleet. He and his crew are victorious in defending Battle Frontier. Both his ship and Battle Frontier confront Macross Galaxy's flagship, Battle Galaxy and destroy it.

He is well liked by female crew members for his good understanding of others. He is an open homosexual and has not-so subtle feelings for Ozma, though he understands well that Ozma will never reciprocate and he is content with just having feelings for him.

She seems to often upset her employer despite having considerable abilities. O'Connor also has cybernetic implants that allow her to directly interface with any computer terminal. She also appears to be secretly working with the cyborg pilot Brera Sterne as his superior. :In the 13th episode, it is revealed that O'Connor is a cyborg as well, as she unleashes from her arm a series of conduits to activate a weapon of mass destruction called a \\"Dimension Eater.\\" She apparently perishes in the ensuing fold dislocation, calmly wishing everyone from the Macross Frontier fleet good luck before the Dimension Eater engulfs her and then almost half of the planet of Galia IV, triggering a large scale Vajra attack on the Frontier fleet in the process and destroying the N.U.N.S. 33rd Naval/Marine fleet base on the planet surface. It is revealed later that O'Connor uploaded her mind into another cyborg body. Returning to Macross Frontier, she picks up Ranka and becomes her manager. :Back in 2047, O'Connor was a scientist in the 117th Long Distance Research Fleet and worked in Dr. Mao Nome's team, surviving the destruction of the fleet during the Vajra attack a year later. It is believed she is chief suspect of causing the destruction of the fleet. In 2053, she continued the research on the V-Type infection in Galaxy Fleet, using Sheryl Nome as the test subject and manufacturing Sheryl's entire idol status for her purposes. :O'Connor is later betrayed by Leon Mishima, who orders her assassination, but she single- handedly kills Mishima's men and escapes from Frontier in her own VF-27 variable fighter. She eventually rendezvous with Brera and reveals to him that Ranka is his sister, but immediately activates his slave mode forcing him to follow her orders. Afterward, she discovers the location of the main Vajra Queen and merges her cybernetic body with it. Eventually she manages to compromise the Vajra fold communication network by manipulating Ranka and sending the Vajra against the Macross Frontier fleet during their final battle. :O'Connor and her cyberlinked fellow conspirators from Galaxy fleet merge with the Vajra network, gaining total control over them, while she declares that they do not need \\"Little Queen\\" Ranka anymore, as they feel the power of controlling the Vajras galactic scale \\"Body\\". Her ultimate plan was to kill all the humans who would not submit to her and have fold crystals embedded in the others so they could be completely under her control, since nothing in the N.U.N.S. arsenal would have been able to withstand the might of the Vajras spacetime capabilities in a galactic scale conquest. :She becomes power-mad once fully linked to the network and declares war against anyone who opposes her, sending mind-controlled Vajra war fleets to Human/Zentradi colony fleets and even to Macross City on Earth. In the end, Ranka and Sheryl's songs release the Vajra from her control and she is soundly defeated by the combined Vajra, S.M.S., and Macross Frontier fleet forces.

After saving Ranka from a wild beast attack, the injuries Brera sustains reveal that he is also a cyborg. He harbors a great deal of concern for Ranka's well-being, but does not exactly know why. A picture discovered by Alto inside the Macross Class SDF Global reveals that Brera had some kind of connection to Ranka before becoming a cyborg. :It is eventually revealed that he is a Major in the Galaxy Fleet Antares Platoon. He becomes Ranka's bodyguard and also likes to listen to her songs, describing the feeling he gets from her songs as being enveloped in a universe that accepts him instead of rejecting him. Brera assists Ranka into delivering her stage 2 Vajra pet \\"Ai-kun\\" to the rest of its species. Some time later, he and Ranka find the planet of origin of the Vajra. Grace O'Connor reveals to Brera that Ranka is his younger sister, but then she activates his slave mode, forcing him to follow her orders. During the final battle, O'Connor makes Brera help the Vajra by destroying Alto's VF-171EX. The explosion of a Vajra carrier nearby shatters Brera's slave circuit implant, thus freeing him from O'Connor's control. He proceeds to encourage Ranka to fight O'Connor's influence and eventually teams up with Alto and covers him while Alto kills O'Connor in the end. ; :A cute-looking animal who first appears from out of nowhere at the Formo Mall while Ranka is promoting her debut album, and then at Mihoshi Academy, running away from Sheryl and the rest of the school after having wrapped itself in Sheryl's panties. It is later on adopted by Ranka, who first discovers it at Griffith Park in Frontier City. Because it is illegal to keep unknown animals from newly contacted planets as pets (in cases where they may bear pathogens, or disrupt the delicate ecological balance of a colony ship), Ranka keeps Ai-kun in secrecy. One day, prior to Ranka's debut concert, Ai-kun disappears, and Ranka has her friend Nanase look for it. Asking for assistance, Nanase shows Luca an illustration of Ai-kun, which he later on identifies as a Vajra larvae. During the concert, Ai-kun undergoes a transformation and upon reuniting with Ranka, molts into a stage 2 Vajra. Ranka and Brera take Ai-kun and leave Island 1 to deliver it to the Vajra home planet. ; : :Alto's father and the 18th s≈çke of the Saotome family of.

A considerable beauty, Alto inherited her good looks and has a strong resemblance to her. She often spoke of flying in the sky, which inspired Alto to become a pilot for the sake of flying in a true sky. ; : :A senior apprentice to Alto's father, Alto regards Yasaburou as his older brother since he is a student of the Saotome family, though he is not a blood relation. Despite his mild-mannered and kind appearance, he is a stubborn and persistent person, making multiple attempts to convince Alto to return to his father and become the rightful heir to the Saotome family. While he is talented kabuki actor and seen as the potential successor to Ranzou, Yasaburou feels that Alto is denying his talent as a kabuki actor and is running away from his true calling, believing that Alto is only going through a phase as a pilot and will inevitably return to kabuki. ; : :The micronized Zentradi president and manager of the small talent agency \\"Vector Productions\\". He hears Ranka's singing by chance and scouts her, becoming her manager. However, after Leon Mishima realizes that Ranka's singing has an effect on the Vajra he assigns Grace O'Connor as her new manager, forcing Elmo away from her. He is seen taking shelter in the same bunker as Sheryl and watching her sing during a Vajra attack. Elmo becomes Sheryl's new manager some time later. A comment made by him when asking Ozma Lee's permission to become Ranka's manager suggests that he is a Space War I veteran. ; : :The director of the Bird Human film, who gave Ranka the part of Mao Nome after the original actress was wounded during a car accident caused by a wild beast attack. This launches Ranka's musical career into stardom. Yamamori's physical appearance was based on that of series director and creator Shoji Kawamori, and his name is also a phonetic play on the director's name as well. ; : :The self-conceited winner of the current Miss Macross Frontier contest, Miranda plays Mayan priestess Sara Nome in the recent Bird Human film.

Dr. Mao is eventually revealed to have a granddaughter, who inherited her fold quartz earrings: Sheryl Nome. She is presumed to have been killed during the destruction of the 117th fleet by the Vajra. ; : :Ranka Lee and Brera Sterne's mother, who was a leading scientist in the 117th Long Distance Research Fleet and worked in Dr. Mao's team in 2047. Ranshe was strongly opposed to O'Connor's plan to sacrifice the Vajra in order to control their fold communication network. She later appeared to Ranka in a vision when she was held captive inside a Vajra mothership. Like Sheryl Nome, Ranshe was also infected with the \\"V-Type\\" infection; since Ranka was conceived and carried to term while her mother was infected, Ranka was born with permanent immunity to the otherwise lethal infection.

Following the Restoration of King Charles II, he declined to accept bishops in the Kirk. He was therefore ejected as minister at Cambuslang. Life He was born at St Bathens, near Dunbar, the son of the Minister of Yester Parish Church, James Fleming, whose first wife (not Robert‚Äôs mother) had been Martha Knox, eldest daughter of John Knox. Robert was educated first at Edinburgh University, where he excelled at the sacred languages, then at St Andrews University where he studied Calvinist Theology under Samuel Rutherford. When he was only 20 he had joined the Covenanting army under David Leslie at The Battle of Dunbar (1650). Following the defeat and execution of King Charles I, and the conquest of Scotland, by the New Model Army of Oliver Cromwell, Fleming was called to be Minister of Cambuslang, when only 24. He remained there until the Restoration, when King Charles II re-established episcopacy in the Church of Scotland. Fleming declined to accept this and in 1673 was summoned to explain himself at the Privy Council in Edinburgh. He did not appear but was later apprehended and imprisoned in Edinburgh Tollbooth. He was later liberated and made his way to London. From there he was called to become the Minister of the Scots Kirk in Rotterdam in the Netherlands. While in the Netherlands, Fleming was accused, but cleared, of plotting with the enemies of the King (by that time, the Roman Catholic King James II and VII). Later, after the Glorious Revolution of 1688 he visited London. Following an illness, he died there on 25 July 1694.

It has various contexts of use in English. 'La quinzaine' is used in French to indicate a two week period, just like 'huit jours' indicates a one week period (in France) even though two weeks are fourteen days and one week is 7 days. It is an old habit to add the current day as to say 'in two weeks plus today'. The English language equivalent is 'fortnight' which means fourteen days. Quinzaine (poetic form) A Quinzaine is an unrhymed verse of fifteen syllables. The word comes from the French word quinze, meaning fifteen. The syllables are distributed over three lines so that there are seven syllables in the first line, five in the second line, and three in the third line (7/5/3). The first line makes a statement. The next two lines ask a question relating to that statement. Examples I would like to drive my car Can you drive a car? Are you fast? I'm a wikipedian. Why do I do it? Anyone? Quinzaine (date calculation) Quinzaine is a term used in the medieval and ecclesiastical calculation of a date, working from a given Feast day of the Calendar. The quinzaine of a feast is a day fifteen days after the feast, counting both the day of the feast itself and the day calculated. It is a variant of the term Quindene:The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, 3rd Edition, revised (Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1964) printing, II: N-Z. it is used in the same way that Octave is used to signify eight days (one week, counting in the initial feast). Example 'The quinzaine of the Nativity of St John the Baptist.' The Nativity of St. John the Baptist is 24 June. June has 30 days: the quinzaine is therefore 8 July. Parliamentary In England the Quinzaine was used to refer to a period during which parliament met according to a Writ of Summons by the King. A specific example would be 1257 parliamentum for which the Rolls were latterly destroyed, probably by fire in 19th or 20th centuries. Its significance lay in the Charters used to confirm parliament's right to sit and be summoned at a specific date. Parliamntum or parliamentum generalissimum could be called every quarter, that coincided with Hilary, Easter, Trinity and Michaelmas terms, which also happened to be the legal terms for the Inns of Courts in Westminster and London.cf. the modern study conducted by J.R.Maddicott, The Origins of the English Parliament,924-1327, (2012), pp.164-5, 185.

He was appointed by Pope Gregory IX in an effort to combat the autonomous Bosnian Church, but found no support in Bosnia. He fled the country in the 1240s, never to return.  Appointment  Ponsa was born in the Kingdom of Hungary. Prior to his rise to the episcopate, Ponsa was a leading superior of the Dominican friars' missionary activities to the territory of the neighboring Cuman tribes. He was appointed Bishop of Bosnia in the midst of the Bosnian Crusade. The crusade's stated objective was to purge Bosnia from heresy, in other words to exterminate the autonomous Bosnian Church. His predecessor, the German-born Dominican John of Wildeshausen, repeatedly requested to be relieved of the bishopric, and in 1238 Pope Gregory IX wrote that the crusade was a success and that he had selected Ponsa as the new bishop. The pope called Ponsa as \\"virtous and thoughtful in spiritual and secular matters\\" in his letter to Theodoric, Bishop of Cumania. Ponsa was also to be assigned jurisdiction over Zachlumia, but probably only its western part, as the rest belonged to Serbia.  Episcopate  Ponsa was consecrated by Bishop Theodoric on 26 April 1238. Pope Gregory believed Ponsa to be very capable, and named him apostolic legate to Bosnia for a term of three years. Matej Ninoslav, Ban of Bosnia, apparently refused to accept Ponsa as bishop, which the Pope regarded as an act of defiance. The crusaders penetrated into Central Bosnia, and a cathedral called Saint Peter's was built in Brdo (Burdo) above Vrhbosna (modern Sarajevo) in 1238. In order to solve the financial difficulties, Pope Gregory sent four different bulls on 22 December 1238 to Robert, Archbishop of Esztergom, and his suffragans, Hungarian prince Coloman, the Dominicans in P√©cs, and the abbot of P√©csv√°rad to instruct them to support Ponsa and his activity in Bosnia. Ponsa's episcopate lasted over three decades, but he functioned as a puppet of Hungary and had no support in Bosnia, where Bosnian Church still prevailed. Despite his determined efforts to settle Hungarian Dominican friars in Bosnia, Ponsa was expelled from Brdo by an heretic attack at the end of 1239. Thereafter, the bishop and his court established their temporary seat in Kre≈°evo. By the first half of the 1240s, he was forced to leave the country and establish a residence in the Slavonian town of ƒêakovo, granted to him earlier by the Hungarian prince Coloman. The relocation was meant to be temporary, but from then on Ponsa and his successors up until Peregrin Saxon never set foot in Bosnia and had nothing to do with its affairs. Ponsa asked Pope Innocent IV to put his bishopric under the jurisdiction of the Archdiocese of Kalocsa instead of the Diocese of Ragusa (Dubrovnik). After a lengthy deliberation, the pope complied with the request on 26 August 1247. The official replacement did not happen until the beginning of the 14th century. Ponsa is last mentioned as a living person in September 1270. He died by March 1272, when Roland first appears as his successor. There is a fringe theory, claimed by Benedictine librarian and archivist G√©za Karsai, that Ponsa was identical with Anonymus (or Master P.), author of the Gesta Hungarorum.

It is a Geological Conservation Review site. Geology Exposures of a sand member are present in the quarry. The sand is of the lower division of the Weald Clay. The sandstone units of the Weald Clay Group represent river deposits which periodically extended into the Wealden lake or lagoon. The sandstones are important as lithostratigraphical markers (units of rock with the same affinity) and are considered to reflect the effects of tectonic uplift in nearby areas feeding sediment into the area. The mineralogy of these sandstones reflects their provenance and they are therefore of great importance for understanding the changes which took place in the palaeogeography of the Weald. Upper Dicker provides the most southerly exposure of any of the Weald Clay sand members in Britain. It is also important for marking the furthest known extension eastwards of Cornubian (what is today Devon and Cornwall) debris (pieces of rock incorporated into the sandstones and clays), indicating the presence of a river system extending out of south-west England at this time.

It is one in a series of small, canyon-bound lakes located on the Mogollon Rim, collectively referred to as the Rim Lakes. It is said to be among the most difficult to access in the region. It is also the second reservoir on Chevelon Creek, downstream from Woods Canyon Lake. The facilities are maintained by Apache‚ÄìSitgreaves National Forests division of the USDA Forest Service. Description Chevelon Canyon Lake was constructed in 1965 as part of a flood control and recreational project. It is small and moderately deep, having an average depth of and a surface area of . The long, narrow lake is formed by an earthen dam impounding the Chevelon Creek in the eponymous Chevelon Canyon. Long Tom Tank, Willow Springs Lake, and Woods Canyon Lake, drain into upper Chevelon Creek, which flows into and through Chevelon Canyon Lake. Chevelon Creek drains to the northeast to the Little Colorado River. The lake is accessible via of unpaved forest road, Forest Road 169 and Forest Road 169B, much of which is difficult or impossible to pass due to heavy winter snowfalls between November and April. There is no direct road access to the lake, the final segment being closed to vehicular access and requires a short hike. As the gated road does not allow vehicle access the lake, boating is limited to small, light canoes or personal flotation devices that can be carried to the primitive boat ramp. Boat motors on the lake are restricted to a single gas motor no larger than 10 horsepower. Amenities are limited to semi-primitive campsites with a restroom, located on the west side of the lake. Fish species In spite of the lake's remoteness and lack of access, it is a premier fishing location due to its stock of rainbow and brown trout. The Arizona Game and Fish Department's desired species assemblage in Chevelon Canyon Lake is rainbow trout, brown trout, and Little Colorado sucker. Rainbow trout is stocked once per year, while Colorado sucker reproduce naturally in the lake and brown trout reproduce in the stream entering the lake. It has been proposed that the department resume stocking Arctic grayling, last stocked in 1990.

During his time at Wigan, he had a one-month trial with Chelsea in November 1982, during which time he played four times for their reserve side. The next three years produced more than 70 league appearances before he moved to Blackburn Rovers on a free transfer in August 1983.

It is part of a loosely connected series with the 1954 companion The Amazing Bud Powell, Vol. 2 and the 1957 Bud! The Amazing Bud Powell (Vol. 3), all released on Blue Note. The album details two recording sessions. In the first, recorded on August 9, 1949, Powell performed in quintet with Fats Navarro, Sonny Rollins, Tommy Potter and Roy Haynes, and in trio with Potter and Haynes. In the second, on May 1, 1951, Powell performed in trio with Curley Russell and Max Roach, and solo. The album is critically prized among Powell's releases. Among the more discussed of the album's tracks is the pianist's composition \\"Un Poco Loco\\" (\\"A Little Crazy\\"), which has been singled out by critics and cultural historians for its musical and cultural significance. The album was remastered and re-issued on CD in 1989 in chronological order with additional, alternate takes. This version is also available along with Powell's 1947 Roost session on the first disc of The Complete Blue Note and Roost Recordings, a 4 disc box set. The album was remastered again in 2001 by Rudy Van Gelder and re-issued as part of Blue Note's The RVG Edition series, with further expansion and reorganization.  Critical reception  The album is rated highly within Powell's musical library, described by All About Jazz as \\"among the pianist's most important recordings\\"Firehammer, John. (October 1, 2001) The Amazing Bud Powell Vols. 1 and 2 All About Jazz. Retrieved on 2008-05-26. and by The Complete Idiot's Guide to Jazz (in conjunction with volume two) as \\"a great introduction to this awesome pianist\\". Jazz critic Scott Yanow characterized it in his book Jazz on Record as \\"full of essential music\\". In Bebop: The Best Musicians and Recordings, Yanow identifies among the highlights of the album \\"Bouncing with Bud\\", \\"52nd Street Theme\\" and \\"Dance of the Infidels,\\" performed by the \\"very exciting quintet\\" of 1949, and also the 1951 trio's \\"three stunning versions of 'Un Poco Loco'\\". Barry Kernfeld in The Blackwell Guide to Recorded Jazz notes with regards to \\"Un Poco Loco\\" that \\"the three takes [of the song]...enable us to hear the evolution of a masterpiece\\", a label with which a critic at The New York Times concurred. While the song \\"Un Poco Loco\\" has been identified as musically outstanding, it has also been discussed as culturally significant. According to Race Music: Black Cultures from Bebop to Hip-Hop, although Afro-Cuban jazz had been introduced in the 1940s by such artists as Dizzy Gillespie and Machito, \\"Un Poco Loco\\" is a significant marker in the establishment of this musical genre, as it revealed \\"the Afro-Cuban turn settling into bebop's acceptable field of rhetorical conventions\\". More than Afro-Cuban, the authors of that book detect what they describe as a \\"Pan- African\\" musical influence in the composition's repetition, harmony and cyclic solo that, while not as obviously Afro-international as Gillespie's \\"A Night in Tunisia', \\"certainly signaled a 'blackness' that became part of the language of subsequent expressions of modern jazz.\\"Ramsey and Ramsey, 128-130. The book Jazz 101 indicates that Powell's performances of this material in 1951 was \\"all the more astonishing\\" in its \\"level of creativity, and even authenticity\\" because little was known at the time of African music or how Latin music (aside from the Cuban influence) could be applied to jazz. According to Yanow, in Afro-Cuban Jazz: The Essential Listening Companion, this composition was Powell's only involvement with Afro-Cuban Jazz.  Releases  The album was first released in April 1952 as a 10\\" LP in Blue Note's 5000 series (BLP 5003). This collected together eight tracks (four from each session) that had previously been released as 78 rpm singles in 1949 and 1951: \\"You Go To My Head c/w Ornithology\\" (BN 1566), \\"Bouncing With Bud c/w Wail\\" (BN 1567), \\"Over The Rainbow c/w A Night In Tunisia\\" (BN 1576), and \\"Un Poco Loco c/w It Could Happen To You\\" (BN 1577). In March 1956, the album was re-issued as a 12\\" LP (BLP 1503), with seven additional tracks (including alternate takes, then a rarity) from both sessions, while \\"You Go to My Head\\" from the first session, and \\"Over the Rainbow\\" and \\"It Could Happen To You\\" (master take) from the second were moved to The Amazing Bud Powell, Vol. 2, initiating the spread of the two sessions between the two volumes. This track listing was kept for the first digital remastering in 1985, when the album was re-issued on vinyl and cassette. In 1989, the album was digitally remastered and released on CD. This time the tracks were listed in session chronological order, which involved \\"A Night in Tunisia\\" (both takes), \\"It Could Happen to You\\" (alternate take) and \\"Parisian Thoroughfare\\" moving to The Amazing Bud Powell, Vol. 2 and \\"You Go to My Head\\", \\"Ornithology\\" (alternate take) and \\"Over the Rainbow\\" moving back. Three further alternate takes from the 1949 session were added, completing the session on this volume. The 1951 session still straddled the two volumes. In 2001, Rudy Van Gelder remastered the album from scratch (he'd previously been credited with disc transfers on the 1989 remaster), and the album was re-issued as part of Blue Note's The RVG Edition series. This release finally united the two complete sessions on one disc, with all second session material on Vol. 2 being transferred. The track listing was also altered so that alternate takes were grouped after the master takes of each session, avoiding the somewhat relentless take repetition of the 1989 release.

He is seen as one of the fathers of psychology in Poland. Witwicki was also the creator of the theory of cratism, theory of feelings, and he dealt with the issues of the psychology of religion, and the creation of secular ethics. He was one of the initiators and co-founders of Polish Philosophical Society. He is one of the thinkers associated with the Lw√≥w‚ÄìWarsaw school.  Background  W≈Çadys≈Çaw Witwicki was the fifth child of Urszula Witwicka, born Woi≈Ñska (niece of the Metropolitan Archbishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lviv, ≈Åukasz Baraniecki), and Ludwik‚ÄìFilip Wasylkowicz Witwicki, as well as father of Janusz Witwicki, the creators of the Plastic Panorama of Old Lviv. He graduated from the University of Lviv, was a student of Kazimierz Twardowski. He also studied at the University of Vienna (under the direction of ) and at the Leipzig University (under the direction of Wilhelm Wundt). He lectured at the University of Lviv and became a professor at the University of Warsaw (1919‚Äì1948). Works Witwicki is the author of the first Polish textbooks on psychology. He also collaborated with other philosophers. For instance, he worked with Bronis≈Çaw Bandrowski to develop a model of psychology based on Franz Brentano's theory on phenomenology. It included an analysis of Edmund Husserl's Theory of Content and the Phenomenon of Thinking.

Geography  The source of the Agatsuma River is Torii Pass ( in altitude), on the border of Gunma and Nagano Prefectures. It gathers tributaries from Mount Asama and Mount Kusatsu-Shirane and flows into the Tone River in Shibukawa city. The Agatsuma River drains most of northwest Gunma Prefecture. The middle section of the river is known for its scenic beauty as it flows through the narrow Agatsuma Canyon. The controversial construction of the Yanba Dam would destroy this area. Transportation The East Japan Railway Company's Agatsuma Line (a single track line) runs along the river from Shibukawa Station in the east to the terminus at Omae Station in the west.

Biography Lionel Britton was born at Astwood Bank, on the borders of Warwickshire and Worcestershire. His father was a solicitor in the village, although the practice collapsed the year after Lionel's birth. Following the death of his father six years later, Lionel and his siblings went to live with their grandparents in Redditch. Britton claimed that the National school he briefly attended in Redditch called him 'too advanced', so he educated himself for a while at his grandfather's house in Hewell Road, before escaping from the family. After existing in Birmingham for a week on just a loaf of bread, he left for London, where his first job was as an errand-boy in a greengrocer's shop, and later in an educational bookshop connected with the University Tutorial College, where one of his literary heroes, H. G. Wells, was once a tutor. He later claimed that his universities were, as he termed them, 'the penny dumps on the secondhand book-barrows' in Farringdon Road and around the British Museum, and that his finishing school was Speakers' Corner at Marble Arch in Hyde Park. A conscientious objector during the First World War, Britton was imprisoned for a year, and, according to some autobiographical notes by his friend Erik Warman, 'he was a difficult prisoner and refused to do any work or take any exercise'.Warman, Erik, 'Life and Lionel Britton', p. 1. Unpublished typescript, Southern Illinois University (SIU), Carbondale, IL, U.S.A. Britton nevertheless managed to find work after his imprisonment, for about six years with the Incorporated Society of British Advertisers, the final two as Assistant General Secretary. At the time, Britton had been working on Hunger and Love, the only novel of his ever published, for some years. It is a huge digressive book about the intellectual life and grinding poverty of a teenage bookshop assistant; Bertrand Russell was so impressed with the novel that he wrote a five-page Introduction to it. By the time the novel came out in 1931, Britton had already made the headlines with his first published play, Brain, which received such considerable attention because of Bernard Shaw's generally favourable comments about it. As early as 1917, Britton had started to learn Russian, and even applied a little later for citizenship of that country, although his application was disallowed because he had no residence qualification. He had another play published ‚Äì Spacetime Inn (1932) ‚Äì but waited until his third play, Animal Ideas, was published very shortly before his long projected visit to Russia in 1935. He stayed there at the expense of the International Union of Revolutionary Writers, but the visit was a great disappointment for him: he hated the queues, what he considered to be the ignorance of the Russian people, and the fact that they would not answer his questions or allow him to walk around freely. Above all, perhaps, he thought that his belief in co-operation as opposed to competition was not being carried out in Russia: he believed that the shortages of almost everything were caused by the government funnelling money into defence. He stayed for three months, and then took the boat back. For several months, Britton remained incommunicado. He had awoken from his utopian dream of Russia to find an only too real nightmare both abroad and at home. Putnam, having made only a modest profit from Hunger and Love and losses with Brain and Spacetime Inn, had already refused to give more than a perfunctory promotion to Animal Ideas. It bombed. He was facing ruin as a writer. Britton escaped to Hastings, a place with literary working-class associations: the town was the setting of Robert Tressell's The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists (1914). There, Britton worked at Netherwood, a large, run-down property bought by the actor and playwright E. C. Vernon Symonds to convert into a left-wing haven for meetings, trade union conferences, or simply as a guest house. Britton received free board and lodging in return for manual work. He hated almost everything about the house. Now demolished, the building is generally only remembered as the last resting place of Aleister Crowley. He wrote more plays and one novel, philosophical works, and dramatised versions of novels by Dickens, Trollope and J. Jefferson Farjeon. But apart from two translations of rather obscure Russian writers in the 1940s, nothing else of Britton's was published. On Britton's writing, his friend Herbert Marshall explains: > 'He would not allow a single comma to be altered from his original text, so > eventually quarrelled with his publishers who refused to publish the vast, > lengthy works without some editing'.Anonymous, 'Forgotten Genius Ends his > Days at Margate‚Äô, Isle of Thanet Gazette, 29 January 1971 Britton spent his last three years as a virtual recluse in Margate and died in 1971 at the local hospital following a heart attack aged 83. Marshall, then Professor and Director of Soviet and East European Studies (Performing Arts) at Southern Illinois University, had all Britton's literary effects transported to the university, where they remain.

History Sultan Air began operations using a SE 210 Caravelle 10B. One year later two Boeing 737-200 were added. With the start of the Gulf War the holiday travel market to Turkey declined and Sultan Air suffered. Flights continued depending mainly on catering to the Turkish workers abroad. But operations could not be sustained depending solely on such a small market (and also the competition from other Turkish charter operators who catered to the same market) and as a consequence at the beginning of 1991 operations were suspended. The two Boeing 737-200s were used for a subsidiary company called VIP Air which continued to operate domestic flights. Late in 1991 VIP Air was reintegrated into Sultan Air and charter operations were reinstated. 1992 saw an expansion of operations with two Boeing 737-300 and two Airbus A300B4 added to the fleet but by the Spring of 1993 the fleet was reduced to two Boeing 737-200s and two Boeing 727-200.

Geographical description Haspin lies on the northern border of the most- productive agricultural region of the southern Golan Heights, which, in ages past, was part of the main road leading up from Hamat Gader and from the Yarmuk valley to the northern regions of the Golan (Jaulan) as far as Hauran. An ancient Roman road criss-crossed the region. The area is rich in natural springs. Archaeology Many ancient artefacts from the Roman and Byzantine periods have been unearthed in Haspin. Sir Laurence Oliphant, who visited here on 15 March 1885, described the remains of a large fort, measuring 68 yards (62 m) x 54 yards (49 m) (the outer wall) and the thickness of the wall that surrounded it measuring in diameter, nestled between Haspin and N√¢b. This is probably the fortified caravanserai (khan) described by Gottlieb Schumacher in his book The Jaul√¢n, situated west of the town of Haspin. The actual figures of this structure posted in G. Schumacher's work, The Jaul√¢n, are x According to Oliphant, the fortress dates from the Early Arab period, and was used by the Crusaders in a later period. Its location is currently unknown.

It has been listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List since 2008. The population is estimated at less than 250 mature individuals, with a decreasing population trend. The total remaining habitat is estimated at only . Characteristics The Javan leopard was initially described as being black with dark black spots and silver-grey eyes. Javan leopards have either a normal spotted coat, or a recessive phenotype resulting in an all-black coat. Distribution and habitat The Javan leopard is confined to the Indonesian island of Java. It is known to inhabit Gunung Halimun National Park, Ujung Kulon National Park, Gunung Gede Pangrango National Park, Ceremai National Park, Merbabu National Park, Merapi National Park, Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park, Meru Betiri National Park, Ijen Mountain, Baluran National Park, and Alas Purwo National Park. It inhabits altitudes from sea level to ranging from dense tropical rainforest to dry deciduous forests. Outside protected areas, it was recorded in secondary forest, mixed agriculture and production forest between 2008 and 2014. In the 1990s, it survived in the seral stages of successional vegetation patterns, which made it less susceptible to humans' disruptive activities than many other mammals. From 2001 to 2004, monitoring research has been conducted in a area of Gunung Halimun National Park using camera traps and radio tracking. Seven leopards were identified in the study area. The total population was estimated at 42 to 58 individuals. The home range of an adult female averaged .Harahap, S., Sakaguchi, H. (2005). Ecological research and conservation of the Javan Leopard Panthera pardus melas in Gunung Halimun National Park, West Java, Indonesia. In: The wild cats: ecological diversity and conservation strategy. The 21st Century Center of Excellence Program International Symposium. Okinawa, Japan. Ecology and behavior Skull of a Javan leopard The Javan leopard's prey comprises barking deer, wild boar, Java mouse-deer, and primates such as crab-eating macaque, silvery lutung, and Javan gibbon. Javan leopards also look for food in close by villages and have been known to prey on domestic dogs, chickens, and goats. Two leopards were radio collared in the Gunung Halimun National Park. Their daily activity pattern showed peaks in the early mornings between 6:00 and 9:00, and late afternoons between 15:00 and 18:00. Threats Seven Javan leopards and one Javan tiger killed during Rampokan, circa 1900. Men and a child with a newly shot leopard in Banten, West Java, circa 1915‚Äì1926. The Javan leopard is threatened by loss of habitat, prey base depletion, and poaching due to human population growth and agricultural expansion. Conflict between local people and leopards is also considered to be a main threat to the Javan leopard. Java has lost more than 90% of its natural vegetation and is one of the most densely populated islands in the world. Primary forests remain only in the mountainous regions at elevations above . Conservation Panthera pardus melas is listed in the CITES Appendix I. Efforts are being made to restore the Javan leopard population and prevent its extinction. Hunting laws are strictly enforced. In 2005, Gunung Halimun National Park was enlarged to three times its original size for the protection of the Javan leopard, the silvery gibbon (Hylobates moloch), and the Javan hawk-eagle (Nisaetus bartelsi). To address the issue of Java's overpopulation and encroachment on habitat of protected species, the Indonesian government has formed a nationwide family planning program. This program makes contraceptive devices like condoms and several different forms of birth control pills more readily available to the public. In captivity In 1997, 14 Javan leopards were kept in European zoos. The Javan leopard is not specifically managed in captive breeding programs in Europe and America. As of 2007, the Taman Safari Zoo in Bogor, Indonesia, kept 17 Javan leopards ‚Äî seven males and 10 females, of which four were breeding pairs. The Indonesian zoos of Ragunan and Surabaya also keep Javan leopards. As of December 2011, two male and one female Javan leopard were kept in Tierpark Berlin, Germany; and one male and one female in the Jakarta Zoo. In 2013, one male Javan leopard was transferred from Tierpark Berlin to the Prague Zoo. Evolution Morphological research indicates that the Javan leopard is craniometrically distinct from other Asian leopard subspecies, and is a distinct taxon that split off from other Asian leopard subspecies in the Middle Pleistocene about 800,000 years ago. In the Middle Pleistocene, it may have migrated to Java from South Asia across a land bridge that bypassed Sumatra and Borneo.

Online version accessed June 23, 2015. Adaptations The play became first known in the Western world in a French language translation by Stanislas Julien, published in London in 1832 as Le Cercle de Craie. This was liberally re-translated into German by Klabund as Der Kreidekreis in 1924, which was very popular.\\"Klabund\\", The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition, 2008. Retrieved May 27, 2008. In Klabund's version, the Emperor marries the heroine at the end of the play, while in the original she returns to live with her brother, who is now a court official. Based on Klabund's play, the Austrian composer Alexander von Zemlinsky adapted a libretto for his Der Kreidekreis, performed in Zurich in 1933. Klabund's version was translated into English by James Laver as The Circle of Chalk, in five acts, published in London by William Heinemann in 1929. It was put on stage in March of that year, produced by Basil Dean, starring the American actress Anna May Wong, Australian actress Rose Quong, and British actor Laurence Olivier.This was possibly Laurence Olivier's first West End theatre role; Hodges (above), claims it was, but his work wasn't really focused on Olivier, rather on Wong. Our article Laurence Olivier chronology of stage and film performances differs. As of 2008, this version is still being produced by various theatre groups. In 1940, Bertolt Brecht wrote Der Augsburger Kreidekreis, a short story based on Der Kreidekreis, which reworks the story by omitting any Imperial intervention and making the first wife the biological mother, but having her abandon the child. The heroine is a serving girl who rescues and raises him, becoming the \\"real\\" mother. In 1944, he further reworked the story as the play, The Caucasian Chalk Circle, moving the events to medieval Georgia, adding a prologue set in Soviet Georgia, and greatly elaborating the narrative. In 2000, The Caucasian Chalk Circle in turn was rewritten as Full Circle, or The Berlin Circle, by Charles L. Mee, set in 1989 East Germany after the fall of Communism.\\"All About Mee\\", Gideon Lester, January 2000, American Repertory Theatre. The famous Kyrgyz author and novelist Chinghiz Aitmatov was also indirectly inspired from the Chalk Circle, while writing his 1960 book, The Red Scarf. He used some indirect elements from the tale very loosely. In Turkey, plot of the legendary Turkish movie \\"Selvi Boylum Al Yazmalƒ±m\\" was based on The Red Scarf. The movie has since been an ageless favourite for turkish cinema critics and popular choice and a unique example of Turkish cinema. In 2018, Claire Conceison wrote and directed a play called The Chalk Cycle based on the original Yuan drama The Chalk Circle, the Brecht adaptation The Caucasian Chalk Circle, and the Custody battle for Anna Mae He.

Life He entered the Society of Jesus in 1660, and, in October, 1662, sailed for Canada, he taught at the Jesuit college while he prepared for missionary work studying the Indian languages. He was ordained in 1668, the first Jesuit to be there.Quinn, Stanley. \\"Julien Garnier.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 6. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 14 January 2018 He went first to the Oneida, but in a few months changed the field of his labours to the Onondaga mission. Garaconthi√©, the Onondaga chief, received him with every evidence of friendship, and, at his request, rebuilt the chapel of St. Mary. On the arrival of other missionaries in 1671, Garnier set out with Father Jacques Fr√©min for the Seneca Nation country. There he found a bare handful of Christian Indians at the Gandachioragou mission. He immediately began to preach and baptize; and he persevered after his chapel was destroyed by a fire which wiped out the entire village. When trouble arose in 1683 between the French and the Senecas, Garnier went with de Lamberville to Governor de la Barre to urge compromise and moderation. He was unable, however, to dissuade the latter from his policy of repression. De la Barre set out upon the ill- starred expedition which was to prevent priests from venturing among the northern tribes for over thirteen years.Pouliot, L√©on. ‚ÄúGarnier, Julien‚Äù, Dictionary of Canadian Biography, vol. 2, University of Toronto/Universit√© Laval, 2003‚Äì Every missionary was recalled at the outbreak of hostilities and Garnier was sent in turn to the settlements of Sault-Saint-Louis, Lorette and Caughnawaga. When access to the Indians was made possible by the treaty of Montreal, in 1701, Garnier returned to his mission among the Senecas. There he remained until 1709, when Schuyler's expedition once more made it necessary for him to return to Canada. His departure marked the end of missionary work among the Senecas; his notes and letters remain one of the principal and most accurate sources of information on this division of the Iroquois. In 1716 Garnier became superior of the missions in New France. He passed his remaining years among the various settlements along the St. Lawrence River, retiring from active life in 1728.

Towards the end of operations it was known as Sunworld Airlines. History Sunworld International Airways (not to be confused with Sunworld International Airlines) was founded by ex-managers of Bonanza Air Lines as Jetwest International Airways in 1981, but initiated operations on May 27, 1983, under the Sunworld name with Douglas DC-9-10 series jet aircraft. Although the word \\"international\\" appears in the airline's name, it appears that Sunworld never operated any international flights on a scheduled basis. Sunworld was based in Las Vegas, Nevada with Las Vegas McCarran International Airport (LAS) initially serving as the hub for the airline. In 1984, the airline was operating nonstop service between Las Vegas and Oakland (OAK), Oklahoma City (OKC), Ontario (ONT), San Jose (SJC), Tucson (TUS) and Tulsa (TUL) with a total of 12 daily nonstop flight departures from Las Vegas operated with Douglas DC-9 jets.http://www.departedflights.com, Feb. 1, 1984 Sunworld International Airlines system timetable In 1985, the airline initiated Boeing 737-300 jet service. Sunworld also operated British Aerospace BAe 146-100 jet aircraft at one point. In early 1987, Sunworld was operating its primary hub at the Reno-Tahoe International Airport (RNO) with nonstop flights between Reno and Boise (BOI), Burbank (BUR), Las Vegas (LAS), Ontario (ONT), Portland (PDX), San Diego (SAN), Seattle (SEA) and Spokane (GEG) in addition to direct service between Reno and Oklahoma City (OKC) and Tulsa (TUL) via Las Vegas.http://www.departedflights.com, 1987 Sunworld \\"Quick, Easy and On-Time\\" print advertisement However, by September 1987 Las Vegas had once again become the primary hub for the airline with up to 21 nonstop flight departures a day while Reno had become a secondary hub with up to 12 nonstop flight departures a day.http://www.departedflights.com, Sept. 14, 1987 Sunworld Airlines system timetable Destinations in September 1987 According to the airline's system timetable dated September 14, 1987, Sunworld was serving the following destinations:http://www.departedflights.com, Sunworld International Airways September 14, 1987 system timetable *Boise, Idaho (BOI) *Las Vegas, Nevada (LAS) (primary hub) *Oakland, California (OAK) *Oklahoma City, Oklahoma (OKC) *Ontario, California (ONT) *Portland, Oregon (PDX) *Reno, Nevada (RNO) (secondary hub) *San Diego, California (SAN) *Seattle, Washington (SEA) *Spokane, Washington (GEG) *Tucson, Arizona (TUS) *Tulsa, Oklahoma (TUL) Besides flights to and from Las Vegas and Reno, the above referenced system timetable also lists point-to-point nonstop service between San Diego and Tucson as well as direct, no change of plane service between several other city pairs in the airline's route system via either Las Vegas or Reno. Previous destinations Other cities previously served by Sunworld during its existence included: * Burbank, California (BUR) * Los Angeles, California (LAX) * Milwaukee, Wisconsin (MKE) * Omaha, Nebraska (OMA) * San Jose, California (SJC) End of operations In January 1988, virtually all flights were cancelled due to financial reasons and the only scheduled route being flown was Las Vegas-Omaha. Nonscheduled charter work was also being undertaken at this time. By April 1988, Sunworld had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and with debts of over US$15 million, operations could not be sustained. On November 7, 1988, the airline was liquidated.Hengi, Fleet details Sunworld International Airways DC-9-14 *3 - Douglas DC-9-14 *1 - Douglas DC-9-15 *2 - McDonnell Douglas DC-9-31 *4 - Boeing 737-300 (Boeing 737-3Q8) *? - British Aerospace BAe 146-100 (formerly operated by Royal West Airlines)  See also  * List of defunct airlines of the United States References * External links *Airtimes Timetables and route map Category:Airlines established in 1981 Category:Airlines disestablished in 1988 Category:Companies based in the Las Vegas Valley Category:Companies based in Reno, Nevada Category:Defunct airlines of the United States Category:Defunct companies based in Nevada ","title":"Sunworld International Airways"},{"id":"17642185","text":"Darayem is a village in Badakhshan Province in north-eastern Afghanistan.

Means was a successful gristmiller and businessman from Waterford, Virginia, with several ties through his business to Point of Rocks, Maryland, where he was station master for the B&O; Railroad. After the secession of Virginia in May 1861, Confederate authorities began to court him over the use of his mill (the largest in Loudoun County). An erstwhile quaker and with considerable interests in loyal Maryland, Means was a unionist and would have none of it. Consequently, the Confederates issued warrants for his arrest forcing Means to flee to Maryland on July 1, 1861 leaving his family behind. Subsequent to his fleeing, the Confederate government seized all his property and assets in Virginia, including 28 horses, 42 hogs, 2 wagons all the flour and meal at his mill. When Union forces under John Geary invaded Loudoun in March 1862, Means served as a scout for the force. For his service, Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton issued him a captaincy with permission to raise a company of cavalry for border service in Loudoun and Maryland. The resulting Loudoun Rangers served as partisans in Loudoun for much of the war, but were eventually mustered into regular service leading to Means' departure from the unit over the issue in 1864.

Ishkashim lies opposite a town of the same name in Tajikistan, although the Tajik town is normally transliterated Ishkoshim following Tajik practice. A bridge linking the two towns was reconstructed in 2006. The town of Ishkashim lies in a fertile valley at an elevation of 3037 meters.Population of AshkƒÅsham, Afghanistan There are roughly 20 settlements in the valley, but, considering the cultivation in the valley is contiguous, it could also be considered one single, larger settlement. The total population of the valley is 12,120. The valley has only one harvest per year. Wheat and barley are cultivated. Poplar and chinar trees grow as well, but there is little firewood. The climate is generally cold, but much warmer than that of neighboring areas, such as Wakhan. The people of the town are predominantly NizƒÅrƒ´ IsmƒÅ'ƒ´lƒ´, and are called Ishkashimi. Most of them speak the Ishkashimi language. The valley lies in an important strategic area, as it commands the only route between Badakhshan, Shighnan, and Wakhan accessible during the winter. There had been a mud fort located in the central village. Ishkashim was earlier a state of the Emir of Badakhshan on the Upper Oxus River. The lands of the state stretched some 16 miles north of the town of Ishkashim, on both sides of the river, to the border of Gharan. Together with Zebak, Eshkashem was under the direct rule of the naib of Zebak, thus also placing them indirectly under the governor of Badakhshan.
