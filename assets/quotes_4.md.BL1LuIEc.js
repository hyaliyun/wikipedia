Levidis (; 1790, Constantinople ‚Äì October 4, 1868, Athens) was a Greek scholar, writer, editor, considered as 'the father of Greek journalism'. Noted for his attempt to turn the Kingdom of Greece into a constitutional monarchy.

Levidis, a man of letters, editor of many books and a prominent figure among the Greeks influenced by the Age of Enlightenment. His mother was also a woman of letters, highly educated and talented in music and languages. Levidis studied greatly throughout his youth. A polyglot, he spoke Albanian, Ancient Greek, English, French, German, Italian, Latin and Turkish with graceful fluency. He was passionate about history, literature and political sciences and graduated the University of Vienna before 1821, along with classmate Dimitri Kalergis. (Kalergis was later to become the prime mover in the Greek coup d'√©tat of 1843, an insurrection which forced Otto of Greece to grant a proper constitution. Resulting in the Greek Constitution of 1844). It was also in Vienna were Levidis was initiated by Atanas BogoridiAthanassio C. Karathanassis, Athanassios Bogoridis: un apercu sur sa vie et son oeuvre in Filiki Eteria, the revolutionary organisation. When the Greek War of Independence broke out, Constantine along with his brother Alexander traveled to the Danubian Principalities in order to volunteer to the Sacred Band, the revolutionary Greek battalion in Wallachia.ŒùŒ≠Œ± ŒúŒµŒ≥Œ¨ŒªŒ∑ ŒïŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒÆ ŒïŒ≥Œ∫œÖŒ∫ŒªŒøœÄŒ±ŒØŒ¥ŒµŒπŒ±, ŒßŒëŒ°Œó Œ†ŒëŒ§Œ£Œó, œÑ. 22 He fought under Prince Alexander Ypsilantis and took part in the Battle of DrƒÉgƒÉ≈üani (June 19, 1821).  Life in Greece  After the formation of the First Hellenic Republic, Levidis became a public servant, appointed by governor Ioannis Kapodistrias to several important administrative committees and posts. In 1832, the Republic was succeeded by the Kingdom of Greece, with the underage Prince Otto of Bavaria as the first King of Greece. During his minority, Bavarian advisors were arrayed in a council of regency headed by Count Josef Ludwig von Armansperg. During the regency of the Bavarian council, Levidis was Councillor of the Finances. But soon found himself opposed and in 1836, after a severe clash with the regents he founded at an early period for the Greek press the historic newspaper Elpis or l'Esperance,(1836‚Äì1868) which he edited bilingually, first in Greek and German, later in Greek and French, with great ability till his death. The Nestor of the modern Greek Press, Levidis was a well-meaning patriot. By his talented and powerful writing in that journal, Levidis he mainly criticised to the outmost the Bavarian rule, first under the regency of Count Josef Ludwig von Armansperg and then under Otto himself. From the very first issue Levidis asked for the establishment of a proper constitution for the newly liberated Greek State. He distinguished himself by his violent attacks on the Bavarian- dominated regency but his fierce criticism and opposition nearly cost Levidis his life. In November 1837, only a year after the publication of the Elpis an attempt was made to assassinate Levidis. A Bavarian major named Feder, together with his company of ten more Bavarian army officers, attacked Levidis in the historic Athenian coffeehouse I Oraia Ellas were Levidis was a regular and he had been peacefully reading. Thanks to the intervention of the many civilians who rushed to defend him the Bavarians withdrew.Politics and Statecraft in the Kingdom of Greece 1833-1843, 1968, p. 227 Consequently, his press was confiscated the publication of the Elpis was forcefully interrupted. In 1843, Levidis actively participated and was one of the protagonists in the Greek coup d'√©tat of 1843 over the adoption of a constitution, and in November he was first secretary and representative of Crete and of Messenia at the National Assembly of the same year. The Elpis resumed publication in 1844 right after the establishment of the constitution. In 1854, during the Crimean War the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the Second French Empire occupied Piraeus to prevent Greece declaring war on the Ottoman Empire. Greece was an ally of the Russian Empire and expected to join its side unless prevented. During the occupation, Elpis engaged in editorial attacks against the occupying Powers and were sympathetic to Russia.Jon V. Kofas, International and Domestic Politics in Greece During the Crimean War, East European Monographs, Boulder distributed by Columbia University Press, New York 1980, p. 98 Because of his severe criticism, Levidis was briefly imprisoned by the French occupation forces. A proponent of the English Party, Levidis was a friend and political ally to Prince Alexander Mavrocordatos. His library was among the most treasured of his time and the salon at his large mansion in Patisia in Athens assembled and entertained many well-known politicians, army officers and aristocrats of the era.ŒöœéœÉœÑŒ±œÇ ŒúŒ¨Œ≥ŒµœÅ, ŒîŒ∑ŒºŒøœÉŒπŒøŒ≥œÅŒ±œÜŒπŒ∫Œ¨ œÄŒøœÅœÑœÅŒ±ŒØœÑŒ±, n.d., p. 53  Literary activities  A prolific author, Levidis published many books about the society, politics and history of his times.

He was a settled Irish Traveller who lived in Boyle, County Roscommon, but hailed originally from Carrick-on-Shannon in County Leitrim. He was a profound influence on many popular folk and traditional singers, based largely on recordings of his singing by the Irish song collector Tom Munnelly which were however not released until after his early death in 1969 at the age of 44. Biography Reilly was born at Carrick-on-Shannon, Co. Leitrim around 1926 to an Irish Traveller family that also included seven sisters and a single brother, Martin. Both his mother and father were singers and passed on to him much of their repertoire. The family travelled the roads of Leitrim, Sligo and Roscommon where after the manner of the times the travellers would thatch, sweep chimneys and do various odd jobs, and also assist with haymaking or harvesting on farms, although for the latter John would frequently be passed over in favour of stronger-looking workers on account of his slight build and relatively frail appearance. He developed a personal preference for, and skill at, tinsmithing, the making of buckets, candlesticks and similar domestic utensils out of tin. During the Second World War, John moved with his family to Belfast, it being easier to get tin in the North than the South at that time, and other provisions were also more easily obtainable; in 1953, John returned to Carrick-On-Shannon. John's mother and father died when he was young and he was left to raise his siblings on his own. In 1962 he took up residence in Boyle, County Roscommon, where he remained for the rest of his relatively short life. In Boyle he repaired bread tins for Egan's Bakery on Green Street, and also sold buckets and billycans which he had made. Although there was general prejudice against Travellers in many places at that time, he seems to have found in Boyle a place where he was well treated and respected and one resident in particular, a publican called Mrs Grehan, took an interest in John's welfare and sometimes gave him meals in her kitchen, where he also got to be known by Mrs Grehan's then young daughters (later to themselves become an established folk act in Ireland and the U.K., as \\"The Grehan Sisters\\"). Unfortunately by the mid 1960s Reilly was living in reduced circumstances in a derelict house on Green Street and was not feeding himself well, which had a deleterious effect on his already somewhat frail health. In 1964 the Irish song collector Tom Munnelly heard Reilly singing at a Fleadh (Irish music festival) in Boyle and the following year, at a time when Munnelly was collecting music as just a sideline from his regular job, he travelled to Boyle to record him for the first time (those recordings, unfortunately, did not survive). Munnelly was amazed at the store of traditional ballads and other songs that Reilly knew and would sing for anyone who asked, including a version of \\"The Maid and the Palmer\\" (Child ballad 21), which Reilly called \\"The Well Below the Valley\\", that had not been collected in the oral tradition for 150 years, as well as others infrequently noted in Ireland. Munnelly recorded Reilly singing for a second time in Grehan's Pub in Boyle in 1966 on \\"a machine which left a lot to be desired\\", and again in 1967 both in Boyle and in a pub in the village of Gurteen, Co. Sligo, where Reilly was visiting; that same year he took Reilly to Dublin for a short holiday during which time he sang for an audience at The Tradition Club in Capel Street, although other clubs in Dublin at that time would not give the floor to genuine traditional singers. Reilly later told Munnelly that this brief stay in Dublin was \\"one of the happiest periods in his life\\". In 1969, D. K. Wilgus, a professor of folksong in the University of California Los Angeles, visited Ireland and was told by Munnelly of Reilly and that same weekend the two set off for Boyle to record him. Recording equipment was set up in the back room of Grehan's pub and between Saturday night and Sunday morning Reilly recorded about 36 songs and ballads for them (elsewhere, Munnelly remarked to his friend Patrick Carroll during a 1973 collecting trip that Reilly probably had a \\"repertoire at between two and three hundred songs, mainly ballads\\"Patrick Carroll, 2001. \\"200 Feet of Posterity: A Profile of Tom Munnelly\\".). Unfortunately the singer was suffering from a cold and his regular friend, Mrs Grehan, was away in hospital for three months undergoing a hip operation so was unable to look after him. When Munnelly and Wilgus returned to Boyle a few weeks later hoping to find Reilly in better health, they found him in a very poor state in his derelict house having had no food for several days and suffering from pneumonia. After failing to revive his spirits in a bar, Munnelly drove him first to a doctor and then to Roscommon Hospital where he was treated but discharged after a few days, however a week later, and after Munnelly had departed, Reilly collapsed in the streets of Boyle and was taken to the Boyle Cottage Hospital, where he died soon after, aged only 44.Munnelly, Tom. 1978.

Munnelly played a tape of Reilly singing \\"The Well Below the Valley\\" to the Irish singer Christy Moore who subsequently performed it on Planxty's album The Well Below the Valley. Moore also recorded \\"The Raggle Taggle Gypsy\\", first on Prosperous and then again with Planxty on their first album: Planxty, again sourced from Munnelly's recordings of Reilly. Sin√©ad O'Connor later recorded Reilly's \\"Lord Baker\\" as a duet with Moore on her 2002 album Sean-Nos Nua, but with amended words and music. Moore has also gone on to sing \\"Green Grows The Laurel\\" (aka \\"The Captain\\") as well as \\"What Put The Blood\\" and \\"Tippin it Up\\" from Reilly's repertoire, and has hinted he may yet do others.Christy Moore: \\"The old songs keep callin' me.\\" 5 August 2016 Moore had in fact already encountered Reilly during visits to Grehan's pub in the mid 1960s, where the presence of the singing Grehan sisters was a drawcard for young, male would-be singers of Moore's generation. Moore's friend and travelling companion Davoc Rynne wrote of them hearing Reilly for the first time: Older residents of Boyle remember Reilly as a basically shy, kind- hearted man; in his liner notes to \\"The Bonny Green Tree\\", Munnelly wrote: A Plaque commemorating John Reilly was unveiled outside Grehans old pub in 2014 by the Grehan Sisters (Francis, Marie & Helen). The proceeds of a Concert given by Christy Moore and the Grehan Sisters in Boyle in 2014 financed the erection of the Plaque for John Reilly.

It lies in the Cotswolds, an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. History Toponymy The village was recorded as Eastun√¶ between 716‚Äì43. It was listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Estone, the name coming from the Old English ƒìast + t≈´n meaning \\"eastern farmstead or estate\\". By the mid 13th century, the village was known as Cold Aston. It was occasionally called Great Aston, to distinguish it from the nearby hamlet of Little Aston. From the 16th century, the name Aston Blank took hold, the suffix \\"Blank\\" possibly deriving from the Old French word blanc, meaning \\"white\\" or \\"bare\\". In 1972, the parish officially became known as Cold Aston again. Some think that the name \\"cold\\" is derived from the Saxon word which refers to a former settlement - in this case probably referring to a disused Roman camp or rest place for use when travelling the Fosse Way. It is fairly certain, contrary to common modern thinking, that the word \\"Cold\\" has no link to a meteorological reference. Governance Cold Aston is part of the Bourton-on-the-Water ward of the district of Cotswold, represented by Councillors Sheila Jeffery and Len Wilkins, and by Charles Alfred Richard Gillams, all members of the Conservative Party. Cold Aston is part of the constituency of Cotswold, represented at parliament by Conservative MP Geoffrey Clifton-Brown. It was part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament prior to Britain leaving the European Union in January 2020. Geography Cold Aston is in the county of Gloucestershire and lies within the Cotswolds, a range of hills designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. It is approximately to the east of Gloucester. It is approximately east of its post town Cheltenham and about west of Bourton-on-the-Water. Nearby villages include Turkdean, Notgrove, Clapton, Naunton and Lower Slaughter. Landmarks St Andrew's Church The Church of St Andrew is the Church of England parish church. It is a largely Norman building, though its walls incorporate Saxon stonework and the original church on this site may have been built in around AD 904. A leading modern authority refers approvingly to the \\"very good\\" west tower of three stages and other Perpendicular elements of the church, commenting, \\"All is evidently the work of the best Cotswold masons, and is the fifteenth-century aggrandizement of a Norman church\\". Much of the present church was restored in 1875. The village pub, The Plough, is a 17th- century Grade II listed building. It is the only pub between the three villages of Cold Aston, Turkdean and Notgrove in May 2013 re-opened after an extensive refurbishment. It now also offers accommodation. The pub's landlord claims that it is residence to a ghost named Old Harry. Education The village has one primary school, Cold Aston Church of England Primary School, a voluntary controlled school for children from the age of 4‚Äì11. In 2019, the school had 87 pupils.

The manga has been serialized in Weekly Sh≈çnen Sunday from the 2008 issue #18 published on April 16, 2008 to 2011 issue #12 published on March 2, 2008. Plot Tadashi is in his second year of junior high school and is a member of the handicraft club and loves nothing more than knitting. Unfortunately he's in a secret relationship with Saya, the leader of a notorious all-girl gang, who says she will kill him and herself if anyone is to find out about it. As the plot progresses the power of the relationship not so subtly shifts from Saya to Tadashi, in several cases debilitating Saya's ability to act and causing her to have a nose bleed and faint at the thought of receiving affection from Tadashi. Characters Main ;Angelica Saya Ikushima :Also known as Demon Head Saya. She is the leader of the all-girl gang called the Onigashirashu and is one of the biggest delinquents in the prefecture. She possesses superhuman strength as she is able to destroy a wall without thinking, when she is angry enough she becomes strong enough to even hurt the Invincible President or sorry enough she can cause a 3 magnitude earthquake, practically immune to harm and can compress snow into a ball harder than steel, nevertheless she is considered very attractive. :She harbors feelings for Tadashi, but has to hide it to keep her impression on her gang that she is the strongest and biggest man hater of them all as she has stated to Tadashi that if they are found out of their secret she will kill him and herself. However after she is away from her friends and alone with Tadashi, she has a sweet love-struck girl personality, and usually asks to be punished in some life threatening way for harming him earlier to keep up her image (chained and waited down before going into a pool, asking him to break her arm, etc). She loves him so much that she could not get within 100 meters of his house without fainting and blushes deeply anytime any close action between them happens or is suggested, where her blushing can cause everything around her to heat up to the point of causing an onsen to turn to steam. Later in the series, she has been unable to compose herself as she used to when she sees Tadashi, often blushing and standing up for him. :Her cooking skills are extremely terrible, for those who eat her recipe will suffer extreme pain all over their body and faint and the drinks she makes its described to be five times worse than her food (the only person that thinks it is delicious is her sister Cupid where Tadashi suffers through it as he is happy at the fact that she makes homemade lunches for him). She is also terrified of dogs, ironically calling them demons. It is revealed that she is extremely rich, that her father runs a very successful electronics company, and she has a little sister named Cupid, though it appears that she does not like her father, calling him Old Man. How she styles her hair makes it look like she has two small horns coming out of her head, probably a reference to her \\"Oni\\" status. Because of how Saki's lack of strength gets so much of Tadashi's attention and because of a desire to be taken care of by him, she has taken up the habit of acting weak or sick from time to time. :It is revealed that she first met Tadashi after he fixed her jacket when she ripped it and how their relationship began. It is also revealed that when Saya And Tadashi started their relationship she did have tsundere personality towards him and denied having a relationship with him claiming they were only friends, nevertheless it was obvious that even then she had secret romantic feelings for him, as she blushed whenever she was around him (though not to the extent she does now). After being attacked by Momo, she cut the rest of her hair off where it is right below her ear, something she likes since her head feels a lot lighter, though it regrows after eating a special seaweed grown by the Student Council President's grandfather.Chapter 58 A running gag is when she thinks about something romantic with Tadashi, she will faint and cause a crater where she falls or if severe enough she will have a nose bleed and lose gallons of blood. This as well as whenever she imagines a scenario or a memory of their time together, she always sees him as an angel like figure or herself the size of a small doll. This as well as a new habit of believing any girl (including her gang members) also have feelings for Tadashi, though ironically thinks that Saki does not. :She later takes up a disguise as a first year girl named Angie who is interested in the Arts and Crafts club, this being so she can be closer to Tadashi as she realized they rarely spend any time together. However she has realized with this personality she is able to say things she would normally be too embarrassed to say to Tadashi, as well as \\"onidereing\\" as she calls it after she goes back to her Saya persona from the memories. She can't be tracked down when disguised due to a lack of horns because they covered by a head band. Because of how effective this persona is, she thinks she accidentally created a love triangle between herself and this new persona for Tadashi's heart. She is unaware that Tadashi knows Angie is herself and is only playing along. ;Tadashi Imamoto :Tadashi is the main protagonist in his second year of junior high school and is a member of the handicraft club who loves nothing more than knitting and his skills are good enough to make stuff animals. He's also in love with Saya, the leader of a notorious all-girl gang known as the Onigashirashu. Later on in the story, he becomes the vice- president of the school council (he didn't want to do this and also wanted to reject it, but he didn't have the chance). He is a very good hearted guy, as he will go out of his way to protect Saya or anyone else (though if it's a girl Saya usually gets jealous). It can also be noted that he is very much one of the only normal main cast in the whole story, and hence he often takes on the tsukkomi role. While doing his duties as the Vice-President, he acts as somewhat of a personal servant to Saki since she is so weak when she does any manual labor he describes it as if she \\"is in a death struggle\\". Tadashi is identical to Kinoshita's example picture of the ideal male student, to the point that, when \\"purifying\\" two males delinquents, he essentially makes two copies of Tadashi. In a recent chapter, when drawing Saya Tadashi's picture looked like a realistic version of her and is called a realist. He truly does love Saya, and will go out of his way to protect their secret relationship or her in situations where he can. It is later revealed in chapter 49, Tadashi has a doll of Saya with him at home. He also becomes depressed when he is unable to spend time with her and has kissed her (twice so far) while she slept. Also when he describes his girlfriend to others, he often states how she might come off as tough but is a very sweet and cute girl, as well as the type of girl that if she had to choose between him and her friends, even if it was to save them from falling off a cliff and only had enough strength for one, she would try with all her might to save both.Chapter 60 He then reveals to Angie (Saya in disguise) that at first he was afraid of Saya when they first met, but overtime he quickly fell in love with her. Onigashirashu ;Yuna Suzune :Yuna is a member of the gang, and is known for her samurai garb, large breasts and eyepatch (when she doesn't wear her eyepatch her hair covers her eye, though her eye is perfectly fine);also throughout the manga she has grown her hair. She is often seen wielding two bokutos and very skilled with it, which she treasures as it was a gift given to her from her brother when she was young. She is also the most protective of Saya, going as far as to dress up \\"lady-like\\" to fool Saya's sister, and at practically any moment will come and fight (most of the time it being with Tadashi under a misunderstanding). She is displayed as a tomboy to the point some believe she is really a guy, though she has a desire to appear more girly. However she usually attacks anyone nearby out of embarrassment after doing something she considers girly. She has a developed a crush on the Student Council President after he told her that if anyone made fun of her for being more girly he would \\"purify them\\", but will try to beat him out of embarrassment, even if she thinks about him in another room she will run over to where he is and beat him. She is considered dumb, as she nearly was able to figure out that Saya and Tadashi were dating, only to stop because her head started to hurt from thinking. She has a brother who is a cross-dresser, where ironically he is mistaken to be a girl, looking like a younger and more feminine version of Yuna, while wearing women's clothing. However, he is much stronger than her and inline to inherit the family Dojo, who wishes to change it to be completely girly. This also shows the reason Yuna first joined up with Saya was because her amazement of her strength and her wish for Saya to train her so she could defeat her brother and this also explains why she is the most battle-hungry member of the gang. She has a habit of grabbing Tadashi to where his head is against her breasts, though she seems to be unaware of this habit. She has also become addicted to mushrooms after eating them, even eating poisonous ones though she appears to be immune to them. She also loves eating chicken, something she likes to keep secret because of Momo's love for birds. ;Mitsuki Asobiya :Her childlike appearance tends to fool people (she is 14 years old), but she is a master of guerilla warfare. She loves three things: Saya, to a perverted nature, often trying to look at her panties, kissing a doll version of her, and usually found sitting on her lap in class, snacks to where she could eat an entire box of chocolate bars in a minute, and bears, where she constantly releases some from the zoo, distracted by anything bear- like to the point she can be summoned by holding out a teddy bear and has a special flute that will call them. Also when wearing a bear costume she appears to gain certain bear-like abilities. Her weapon is a toy hammer with a cute bear's head on it, but the toy hammer will become a scythe when she is in her serious mode, where in her serious mode she can easily defeat Yuna. Though she looks and acts like a little girl, since she is attending the same school she might be their age or have skipped grades, however this doesn't seem to be the case since she always scores a 0. After Tadashi gave her a stuffed bear he made that she affectionately calls Kumarou, she has become friends with him, now calling him Nice-moto and asked him to make her a stuff doll of Saya with glasses (one he keeps a few of as well). This making her the \\"first\\" Onigashirashu to befriend a male. She was referred to as Ojousama, suggesting she might be rich or related to yakuza. She has a desire to own Cupid's bear Kumael. She usually bickers with Yuna about the simplest things. ;Momo Akitsuka :Momo is the spy of the group, and always wears a bandanna over her face, very thin legs which are covered by a long skirt and she fights using a large two prong sword connected to a long chain. She has a very laid back demeanor. She never speaks, though she can and mimic voices perfectly, but she actually knows that Tadashi and Saya are in love, and in her own way tries to help them, sometimes exhaustively preventing anyone from disturbing their lunch date from the shadows. She was a former member of the gang \\"The Haou- Sou\\" which sent her to spy on Onigashirashu so when the time was right she could kill Saya, her name as part of the gang was the Third Haou \\"Momo\\", her mission was to become friends with the members of the gang and specially befriend Saya so that she could not attack one her friends, so her original gang could take the heads of \\"kings\\" one them being Saya. But as the showdown between friends, she realized that all the other members really liked her as part of the gang and apologized to her for not noticing sooner that she was suffering as to betray them, she could finish her mission accepting that they are truly her friends and was welcomed back. However, because of her acts as a spy, the Haou-Sou know of Saya and Tadashi's relationship. It is also implied by both Amane and Tadashi's mother that she may have developed feelings for Tadashi. She also had a part-time job, only to be fired by the plan of Tomeo Kinoshita, the school council president. She also seems to be involved with the student council under the alias Sumomo, where Saki is the only one to point out she is Momo where everyone else thinks she is wrong, but this could either be because she wants to infiltrate it or just act as a normal student. She has a love for birds, especially an anime one called Piyoto and is No. 1 in the fan club, even her helmet as part of the Haou-Sou resembled a bird's head. Student Council ;Tomeo Kinoshita :Tomeo is the president of the school council of Tadashi and Saya's school. He has rehabilitated 999 juvenile delinquents so far, and targets Saya and the Onigashirashu to accomplish in rehabilitating 1,000 juvenile delinquents, though he seems to do this simply by changing their appearance to match the \\"ideal\\" student. Tomeo is basically immortal, an ability he attributes to his belief in justice, which cannot die. However, when he realizes that he himself done something wrong, he becomes full of self-hatred and is injured via a lightning bolt that strikes him. He is often seen praying to an odd statue with the letter J on its head, calling it the god of justice, every time he seeks guidance. He is considered the worst enemy by the Onigashirashu. He later selects Tadashi to become the vice- president of the school; the position was open because he is so obnoxious that no one wanted it. Tomeo is contrastly surrounded by evil spirits, hinted at earlier when the Evil Ward charm Youko gave Tadashi burst into flames when he entered the room, and later directly stated by Shuu. He is actually a good hearted guy, but what he does to help is often considered extremely annoying by others. And though seemingly stupid, he has displayed a good insight on people, he defended Yuna's desire to be more feminine, and was able to tell her brother Yumi was a male at first glance. Also he scores a perfect 100 on tests. His passion for justice seems to cloud his common sense, demonstrated when he is overjoyed when Yumi Suzune challenges his position, even offering his support, before Tadashi reminds him that he will no longer be the president if he wins. He has long white hair that is(ironically) clearly against the standards of the school. He has a grandfather who looks very similar to him (besides being older and having a mustache), who lives near the ocean. He is just as Justice happy as his grandson, probably being the reason for his grandson personality. ;Saki Nijinose :The Student Council Treasurer and granddaughter of the principal. Like her position, she often thinks of how much something is going to cost, yelling at Yamata for kicking the metal door because overtime it could cause rust and have to be replaced which is expensive. She keeps track of the damage of what the gang causes and gives them a bill every time she runs into them. Saki is portrayed as being extremely weak and delicate, as she could not open a door Mitsuki could easily and just by trying injured her fingers, though Saya is jealous of her lack of strength because of all the attention Tadashi gives her from it. In a way she is displayed as Saya's opposite. Tadashi often bandages her which causes jealousy from Saya. Though if she gets angry enough, she displays a terrifying power and swears a lot, though she appears to be unaware of this. This scared even the Onigashirashu and Student Council to the point where they behaved for a whole week after the incident. She appears to be the only competent member of the Student Council, where the students will talk to her with issues rather than the President. Tadashi helps out Saki a lot because of her weak state and his helpfulness lead her to fall in love with Tadashi. This lead for her to cling and protect Tadashi which made many people believe they are dating. She first started to show feelings for Tadashi where she went to confront Saya (not knowing this was because of their date), speaking up to defend him, and going into a dazed state when she sees him. Her feelings for him have gotten so strong that she tries to prevent a situation where they are left alone together or where Tadashi would see her in more revealing clothes like a swimsuit. Later on, due to her growing feelings as well as Saya's posing as Angie, she too has disguised herself as a new member of the Hand Crafts club. Due to Tadashi helping her every time she asks and Kenji's words suggest that she is slowly getting fat, saying her legs make \\"squishy sounds\\" as well as her habit of adding chocolate to whatever she eats, calling it her life force. Because of the sudden interest in getting her legs thinner, she has a habit of believing people are pointing out that she has fat legs. When Saki gets emotional over the school's finances and breaks out into a grumble, she has a tendency to revert to her grandmother's native dialect. Both Hibari Imamoto and Mitsuki refer to her by the nickname Muchiko (\\"muchi\\" means \\"plump\\" in Japanese and \\"-ko\\" is a common suffix attached to female given names). ;Shuu Yamata :The Student Council Secretary, described as \\"cool and mysterious\\" by the President. He always carries a cross sword (later revealed to be a radish) and has been said to use it on the President, who does not mind since he is invincible. He later states he is a Spirit Hunter and regularly attacks the president because he is surrounded by evil spirits, being the main reason he joined the student council was to exorcise the spirits from him. His exorcism techniques involve housekeeping and kitchen utensils; as such he is also a good housekeeper and cook, to the point that Tadashi calls him an aspiring househusband, even introducing himself as House Dad. He also seems to know a lot of good ways to save money this shows he does not like to waste it. He is rarely seen and will appear suddenly when a spirit appears, this is due to him exorcising spirits around the school. Haou-Sou The Haou Sou (meaning the one supreme king) is a rival gang that aims for the defeat of the Onigashirashu. To that end they had Momo infiltrate the Demon Head Gang to get close to Saya and eventually kill her. But Momo became too friendly with the gang and defected from the Hao Sou at the last minute. They each wear an animal helmet based on the Chinese constellations. Because when Momo was their spy, they know of Tadashi's and Saya's relationship, believing that has something to do with her sudden increase in strength, so their overall plan is to take control of all the gangs in all the schools by inciting the students to protest against mixed sex education, ultimately splitting them up. However it has been noted that they could be doing this solely for the reason to not interact with the opposite sex because the Haou-Sou has trouble interacting with the opposite gender. In the end, the members of Haou-Sou resolved their issues, and the group disbanded.Chapter 101 ;Tatsumi Amane, a.k.a. Tenryu \\"Heavenly Dragon\\" \\"The Azure Dragon of the East\\" :He is the leader of the Haou-Sou. He wears a helmet that seems to look like, or represents a Dragon, and has a hard time seeing while wearing it, being a running gag that he is facing the wrong direction when talking. He looks similar to Saya. He is actually quite handsome, but his gynophobia is so extreme that he sweats profusely when around girls while not wearing his helmet. He states he developed this after his secret girlfriend dumped him over her friends, though this is most likely a lie to split apart Saya and Tadashi,Chapter 59 this is later confirmed to be true by Aoi as he desires Tadashi to be happy, seeing that as to kill Saya and not to start hating the opposite sex like he does. He joined the Student Council after the President offered him a position after seeing how quickly he stopped the ruckus (which were caused by his cohorts) to be Vice-Vice President, though he constantly decides to drop out while working around Saki. Though recently he has discovered that Saki has a crush on Tadashi.Chapter 61 He keeps coming up with plans to bring them together to ultimately break up Saya and Tadashi, but is constantly stopped because of his gynophobia. The only people that do not activate his gynophobia is Aoi and Momo, this is because at one time they were teammates which he states \\"teammates are alright\\". His name is a pun off his title, as Tatsu can also mean Dragon in Japanese (though the kanji does not mean \\"dragon\\" per se). ;Toraya Akito, a.k.a. Koou \\"Tiger King\\" \\"The White Tiger of the West\\" :He wears a Tiger helmet and the second Haou-Sou. He is the tallest of the group. He goes into a horrifying love-love mode with any girl who comes in contact with him, and snaps out of his girl-craziness trance when he hugs Tatsumi. President Kinoshita thinks Toraya is Yuna's boyfriend, though this is mainly because of the incident where she touched him. By Chapter 101 of the series, however, he was able to behave normally around women. His name is a pun off his title, as Tora means Tiger in Japanese. ;Kamehiro Aoi, a.k.a. Koukaku \\"Armored Horn\\" \\"The Black Tortoise of the North\\" :Her helmet is supposed to look like a Tortoise, or symbolizes it and the fourth Haou-Sou. She comes from Akita Prefecture, and is mortified to have boys hear her speak in her dialect when she gets excited, to the point of beating them up because of it. She doesn't set off Tatsumi's gynophobic reaction, because \\"teammates are alright\\" even though Akito falls for her if she touches him and she beats them up if they hear her speak in her dialect. Aoi has been developing a more urban attitude and broke off from the Haou-Sou.Chapter 71 Her name is a pun off her title, as Kame means Turtle in Japanese. ;Momo Akitsuka, a.k.a. Third Haou \\"Momo\\" \\"The Vermillion Bird of the South\\"(former member) :She was a member of the Haou-Sou. Her mask is supposed to represent a Phoenix. She was a spy sent by the Haou-Sou to get information to take down Saya. Even though she was going along the plan with Haou-Sou, she could not take down the friends that she made in her one-year mission and she was accepted back into Onigashirashu after resigning from her original group. It is currently unknown what is her reason joining this group in the first place because of their goal as to separate mixed sex education. She also knows all the weaknesses and secrets of all the members Haou-Sou, and uses this to keep them away from Saya and Tadashi. Tadashi's Family ;Hibari Imamoto :Tadashi's mother. She is a very energetic woman, where because of this she gets along with Mitsuki very well and both refer to each other with the Japanese honorifics chi. She has a habit where once she has set her mind on something, it is impossible to change it. Where in one instant even though her son told her a large squid crushed their car, she believed he stayed at the beach because he was with a girl, even when the squid was right in front of her. Despite her eccentric personality, she appears to have a good insight on people, as it is believed that she knows of Saya and her son being together. She is a pilot and seems to work as a detective, as she was working on a serial killer case. ;Masashi Imamoto :Tadashi's Dad. Saya's Family ;Cupid Maya Ikushima :Saya's little sister. Their father runs a successful electronics company called the G.I. Group. Unlike her sister she likes to show off her wealth by having her robot teddy bear fly her to school and lay a long red carpet for her to walk on, though she still has a child-like personality. She came because she missed her sister and addresses her sister by her middle name, Angelica. She sees her sister in high regards, saying she is ten times greater of a woman than she is. She is completely unaware of her sister's delinquent status and is the only person who likes the drinks Saya makes, going to her school solely for a cup. ;Jun Ikushiama :Saya's father. Long before he was the strongest fighter who conquered. While he is invincible, he now constantly suffers from Saya. He greatly cares for Saya and is overjoyed that she has friend but wants her husband to defeat he can acknowledge him. Others ;Youko :Leader of the Knitting Club that Tadashi is a part of. Saya is usually jealous of her because it appears to her that Youko would make a better girlfriend to Tadashi (or this can just be because of any girl being around him in general). She returns when she asks Tadashi to help teach the new club member Angie (Saya in disguise) sewing. ;Genryuu Mito :Better known as Mito the Steel or King of Ibaraki. He is the gang leader of Ibaraki and always seen dressed up as a knight (hence his title) with metal pipes as armor and weapons, which he doesn't ever remove even when he is eating or in the summer heat, yet removed his helmet to give a heartfelt plea to Mary. He displays a very strong code of honour. He has a horse and normal fights while riding him, and cares for it as well, pleading for Saya not to kill his horse after he was defeated. Where Tadashi went to the roof to meet Saya for their usual lunch date Tadashi met Mito and seemingly became fast friends. He becomes supportive for Tadashi and his girlfriend, completely unaware that the girl is Saya. He can change his personality at will, being kind and friendly towards Tadashi but vicious towards Saya, in the same sentence. He returns after hearing that the Undefeated Demon Head Saya was defeated by Tadashi and came to give him a congratulations present, where through this he mistook Saki as Tadashi's girlfriend. He also once saved a foreign exchange student named Mary, who fell in love with him after, however he sees himself as too immature to go out with a girl, but tells her when he does he will go out with her. He is a very strong fighter, able to take on multiple people at a time and sense a person spying on them from behind a wall, but nowhere near as strong as Saya. He is against the Haou-Sou, where he tried to defeat them only to be taken out by Momo. He is also portrayed as a bit of an idiot, believing his horse was making cat sounds where it was coming from the opposite direction (although was caused by his helmet) and constantly mistaking Saki as Tadashi's girlfriend (as do many other people). He is also displayed to be very tall, where he had to bend down to walk through a doorway. ;Kenji :Heir to the Taketori Financial Corporation whose company made its fortune through its multiuses for bamboo. He makes his first appearance claiming to be that he is the fiance to Saya, something she didn't know anything about, believing her father set it up. He has a bad habit of proposing to every girl he sees but a natural talent of wooing women, even Yuna (which she denies) and the ability to know what a woman would want (from giving Mitsuki a bear and Momo a rare bandanna even though he never met them before), only to be snapped out of it by the attacks of his assistant Misako (though he proposes marriage to her as well). He does not know who Saya is, referring to her by Angelica. But when he does, though first shocked by her delinquent attitude, kisses her on the cheek and wants to get married immediately. He finds men to be the \\"enemy\\". However, from that kiss Saya lost all meaning for life and went on a destructive rampage, only to be brought down when she saw Tadashi. He later returns as a student now living in a giant bamboo next the school (where the inside looks like a mansion) in hopes of getting his fiance to marry him, though he still asks marriage to any girl he sees (most of the time he charms Yuna). However, when he got mad at Saya for beating him up he decided to be \\"honest\\" and stating that \\"Tadashi and Saya looked like a perfect couple\\", he lost the ability to \\"gaze into women's hearts\\" probably because of being \\"honest\\", where instead of flirting he insults women unconsciously through this \\"honesty\\". He believes he gains back the ability after he successfully flirted with a new character named Yumi, only for later it to be revealed that Yumi is actually a he of course still not knowing this he was still gone marry Yumi but when Yuna flips up the skirt and is shoked and tries to call off the wedding but is Yumi does not want to let him go and cancel it, yet states he was joking after. He is currently still in shock from this discovery but later revealed he was forced to marry Yumi after all, which he uses him as a chair. It is suggested in recent chapters that his company has gone bankrupt, as he Misako and Yumi have been evicted from their house and currently living in the student council office. ;Misako :Assistant to Kenji and more serious of the two. She usually has to snap him out of his love struck attraction by assaulting him (through the use of ninja weapons like throwing stars to scythes). She and Saya appear to be the only girls that aren't affected by his charm. Though she doesn't appear to care very much for him, asking if she should leave first to an obviously beaten up Kenji. After Yumi and Kenji married (from which Kenji tried to escape from after discovering Yumi's gender), Misako seems to have broken her cool and intelligent persona and opened her eyes to the world of BoyLove. She can be seen reading a BL novel when Yuna tried to stop the Student President from marrying Yumi, or videotaping Kenji and Yumi's 'BL interactions' in various accounts. Various times Misako would also blurt out lines such as \\"A man being with a woman that is a man is completely normal!\\" at inappropriate times and volume, also, she seems to have forgotten how she used to behave before discovering the world of homosexual love. ;Yumi Suzune :Yuna's older brother, who is a cross dresser being mistaken ironically to be a girl. He really hates liars, saying he would tear out Kenji's throat if he broke their engagement, which is why he has a yandere personality. Though it is unknown if he is gay or just enjoys acting like a girl. Though he looks very girly, he is actually much stronger than Yuna. He is still currently Kenji fiance with a wedding ring on his finger, however later calls it off stating he was just teasing, and he hates the student council president because he calls him male even though he calls himself female. He was the Student Council President, but after he started to give attention to Tadashi, both Saya and Saki spoke against it. He renounces the position after figuring out that his sister has a crush on the Student Council President, believing that would be more enjoyable to exploit. In chapter 50 it is revealed he has been living with Kenji after forcing him to marry him, but only using that position to boss him around and use him as a chair. He then divorces him so he could marry the Student Council President (where throughout the entire time the Student Council President was completely unaware of what was happening) as a way to get his sister to dress more girly like when they were younger. He later forces Kenji to remarry him. ;Munabu :President of the Newspaper Club and friend of Tadashi. He is always looking for a good story and has vital information on others, like for the G.I. Group and Taketori Financial Corporation. ;Terumi Houjou :She is No. 3 of the Piyouta fanclub along with Momo, being a part of the Piyouta 4 though the other two have yet been shown, as well as classmates of Tadashi. She tries to help Saki with her diet by getting her off chocolate and help get her legs thinner. She suspects Saki's sudden interest in her appearance is because she has feelings for someone (Tadashi). ;Mary :An international exchange student from America. She is in love with Genjuurou Mito and follows him wherever he goes. Mito once rescued her from a \\"drunk villain\\" and misunderstood his speech for a confession of love. She wants them to wear matching clothes as proof of their relationship. Mito has not reciprocated her affections yet, as he feels he is still too immature to have a relationship.Chapter 70 ;Souta Hanamura :A younger brother of \\"The Wicked Leg\\" Hanamura. He fell in love with Saya's persona, Angie, while not knowing who she really is. Short for his age, he even runs as fast as his brother. In chapter 95, he accidentally had his first kiss with (Kuro)saki.

Formerly a Spanish Navy unprotected cruiser, she was captured in 1898 during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and commissioned into the U.S. Navy. For her technical characteristics and operational history as a Spanish ship, see Spanish cruiser Don Juan de Austria. Technical characteristics USS Don Juan de Austria was built in 1887 at Cartagena, Spain, for the Spanish Navy. Sunk in shallow water on 1 May 1898 in the Battle of Manila Bay during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, she was raised from Manila Bay under contract and overhauled and refitted at Hong Kong. The 4.7-inch (120-mm) guns she had in Spanish service were replaced with 5-inch (127-mm) guns mounted in sponsons on her main deck.Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships 1860‚Äì1905, p. 383 In later years, these in turn were replaced with four 4-inch (102-mm) guns.Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships 1860‚Äì1905, p. 166 She was rigged as a barque and had one funnel. Operational history USS Don Juan de Austria commissioned at Hong Kong on 11 April 1900, Commander T. C. McLean in command. From 5 June 1900 to 18 October 1900 Don Juan de Austria was anchored off Canton, China, to protect American interests during the Boxer Rebellion. She sailed from Hong Kong 25 November 1900 and arrived at Cavite in the Philippine Islands on 28 November 1900. She was employed in the Philippines in general duties in connection with taking possession of the newly acquired territory, supporting U.S. Army operations against the insurgent native forces (see Philippine Revolution), transporting troops and stores, blockading insurgent supply routes, and seizing and searching various towns to ensure American control. Aside from a visit to Yokohama, Japan, from 1 June 1902 to 27 July 1902, she continued her duty in the pacification of the islands until 19 April 1903. After repairs at Yokohama, Japan, from 27 April 1903 to 1 June 1903, Don Juan de Austria cruised along the Chinese coast for maneuvers with the U.S. fleet, an indication of intensified American interest in the Far East after the acquisition of Pacific island territories. She departed Hong Kong 16 December 1903 for the United States, sailing by way of Singapore, Ceylon, India, the Suez Canal, and Mediterranean ports to arrive at Portsmouth Navy Yard, Kittery, Maine, on 21 April 1904. She was out of commission for repairs from 5 May 1904 to 10 December 1905. Joining the Third Squadron, Atlantic Fleet, Don Juan de Austria sailed from Norfolk, Virginia, on 28 February 1906 to patrol off the Dominican Republic to protect American interests there. She returned to Portsmouth Navy Yard on 21 February 1907 and was placed out of commission there on 7 March 1907. Loaned to the Michigan Naval Militia, she sailed from Portsmouth 28 July 1907 by way of the St. Lawrence River to Detroit, Michigan, serving there on training duty until the American entry into World War I in April 1917. Don Juan de Austria was recommissioned on 6 April 1917, and left Detroit on 17 July 1917 for Newport, Rhode Island, arriving there on 6 August 1917. She patrolled inshore and at sea off New England's coast. She arrived at New York, New York, on 7 August 1918 to escort two U.S. Army tugs and their barge tows to Bermuda. She then returned to Newport 1 October 1918 and towed the sailing schooner USS Charles Whittemore to Charleston, South Carolina, before revisiting Bermuda to escort a group of American and French submarines to Newport, arriving 1 November 1918. The war ended on 11 November 1918. On 3 April 1919, Don Juan de Austria arrived at Boston, Massachusetts, to join the special escort for the transports returning members of the 26th Division, U.S. Army, from Europe. She was decommissioned at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on 18 June 1919, and sold 16 October 1919. Notes References * Chesneau, Roger, and Eugene M. Kolesnik, Eds.

When fully completed it will extend a distance of from East Boston to the Neponset River. History The Harborwalk is a cooperative project of the City of Boston, the Boston Planning and Development Agency, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection, The Boston Harbor Association, and private property developers. Since 1984, the project has established parks, walking paths, educational sites, transportation facilities, and other amenities along the harbor. Many developers of private land along the harbor have been required under the provisions of the Boston Zoning Code and of Chapter 91 of Massachusetts state law to set back new buildings from the water and to provide publicly accessible waterfront pathways. A map of the proposed route shows that the completed Harborwalk will consist of a continuous trail from Charlestown in the north to Dorchester in the south, plus many other discontinuous trail segments. A map and trail guide describe the current status of the route. An interactive map highlights sights along a portion of the walk in downtown Boston. As of 2016, 38 of the originally planned of trail have been completed. Following the September 11 attacks, plans to extend the Harborwalk to the four miles of shoreline around Logan Airport were abandoned. As an alternative, planners are now considering an inland route connecting the Harborwalk through the East Boston Greenway to Constitution Beach. Connections to other trails The Harborwalk connects with many other trails. From north to south, these include the following: Harborwalk sign along the South Bay Harbor Trail *East Coast Greenway *East Boston Greenway *Freedom Trail *Charles River Bike Paths *Millers River Trail *Proposed extension of Somerville Community Path *Rose Kennedy Greenway *Walk to the Sea *South Bay Harbor Trail *Lower Neponset River Trail *Quincy RiverWalk to Squantum Point Park Public art Bench by Judy Kensley McKie at Eastport Park Sculptures and memorials, including some by noted artists, have been placed at many locations along the Harborwalk. Playful fish sculpture benches by Judy Kensley McKie and sculptures by Susumu Shingu and David Phillips have been created for Eastport Park, South Boston. Sculptures by Tony Smith, Willem de Kooning, Luis Jimenez, Dennis Oppenheim, William G. Tucker, and Sol LeWitt are located on the University of Massachusetts Boston campus. Between the Institute of Contemporary Art and the John Joseph Moakley United States Courthouse, a series of artworks by Ross Miller evoke moments in the history of Fan Pier. \\"Untitled Landscape\\" by David von Schlegell is located at Harbor Towers. The East Boston part of the walk travels through an outdoor sculpture park, HarborArts, situated in a working industrial shipyard, the East Boston Shipyard and Marina. An interactive musical sculpture, \\"Charlestown Bells,\\" by Paul Matisse (grandson of the painter Henri Matisse) is located along the walkway of the Charles River Dam. The bells were installed in 2000, but had fallen into disrepair before a 2013 restoration. Memorial sculptures found along the Harborwalk include a memorial to firefighter Robert M. Greene at Castle Island in South Boston; a Korean War Memorial at Shipyard Park in the Boston Navy Yard in Charlestown; and a United States Maritime Service memorial in the North End's Langone Park. Historical exhibitions Rolling Bridge Park along the Boston Harborwalk, contains a permanent installation of one salvaged section of the six original rolling segments from the Old Colony Railroad Bridge, a six-track, triple-leaf, counter-weighted Scherzer rolling lift bascule drawbridge, built in 1895 over Fort Point Channel. Along the Harborwalk are several indoor and outdoor displays of historical materials, some of which are available for view 24 hours a day. A selection from the archive of Norman B. Leventhal's collection of Maps of Boston Harbor and Massachusetts Bay is located in the lobby of the Boston Harbor Hotel. In the lobby of Building 114 at the Boston Navy Yard is an exhibition of boat models, photographs and boat building tools. The Maritime Museum at Battery Wharf was built by the developers of the Battery Wharf Hotel as \\"mitigation\\" under the state's Chapter 91 law, to compensate the public for private use of waterfront land.

MBTA Boat services stop at the Navy Yard in Charlestown, at Logan Airport in East Boston, and at Long Wharf and Rowes Wharf downtown. Future development New segments continue to be added to the walk as development occurs along the edge of the harbor. A 2012 report prepared for The Boston Harbor Association concluded that approximately 60% of the total possible length of the Harborwalk has been completed. In 2019, construction was completed on a residential building on the site of the former Anthony's Pier 4 Restaurant in South Boston. The Harborwalk extends around the new building. The St. Regis residences, a development proposal on a site adjacent to Pier 4, was opposed by an environmental group that argued that the proposal's accommodation of the Harborwalk was inadequate. Construction began in 2019.

Design The building's three-sided construction makes good use of available space, yet the building's design sacrifices valuable floor space by including a massive atrium running the entire height of the building. The building's most recognizable characteristic is its shape and structure. It is most simply described as triangular (a more apt description would be a triangle with all the corners cut off), hence why one of its nicknames is 'the Triangle'. Also distinctive is the visible emergency elevator, which is used to transport cargo and not everyday passengers. Development Construction began in November 1971 and was finished on March 6, 1974. At the time of its completion, its elevators were the fastest in the world at 540 meters per minute. It was the tallest building in Tokyo from March to September 1974 when it was surpassed by the Shinjuku Mitsui Building which is located just to the east of the Sumitomo building. It was developed by Sumitomo Realty & Development, the real estate arm of the Sumitomo Group, and previously housed Sumitomo Realty's headquarters. A pioneering skyscraper in Shinjuku, many companies are tenants of the building, as well as several restaurants. The free observation deck on the 51st floor was closed on April 1, 2017.

History  The first consecration of the church was done by Cardinal Peter Pazm√°≈à on 24 May 1631. At first it was only a small church with shided roof and with a small monastery. At the beginning of 18th century the monastery was in the hands of Francis II R√°k√≥czi and Mikul√°≈° Bercs√©nyi, who expanded the monastery partially. By the end of 19th century, according to the plans of K. B√°lint the next renovation was done. The last complex reconstruction was done between 1978 and the end of the 20th century.  Description  Pulpit The wooden pulpit is part of the Baroque furniture of the church and it was probably made during the extensive reconstruction in 1766‚Äì68. It was certainly restored and repainted many times, and some of the more minute details of the decoration were lost or changed. The last restoration happened in 2004‚Äì05. The access is from the adjoining monastery through a short link corridor. On the balustrade of the pulpit four cherubs are perched with the symbols of the Evangelists, some of them holding a pen and a book. Another characteristic part of the decoration is an arm holding a cross. The abat-voix is decorated with a dove, the Tablets of Stone and a pelican symbolizing the sacrifice of Christ.  Current use  Today the monastery serves as the location of the town museum and as a part of the accommodations for the spiritual order of Franciscan friars.

In addition, he completed the Palazzo Sacchetti in via Giulia and contributed to the fortifications of Fano and Civitavecchia. In Monte San Savino, he contributed to the construction of the Palazzo di Monte and the Loggie dei Mercanti following the designs of Andrea Sansovino and built the Porta Fiorentina following the designs of Giorgio Vasari, and decorated with frescos representing the so-called Madonna delle Vertighe tra Santi (Madonna of the Peaks among Saints).

She was the first woman Member of Parliament from Northern Ireland, and the second woman to be returned to a seat in Westminster from a constituency on the island of Ireland (the first to take her seat).  Early life  She was born at Donaghadee, County Down, and educated at Bangor Collegiate School, Glendower Preparatory School, London, and abroad. Her father was Ulster Unionist MP Sir Walter D. Smiles and her mother, Margaret Heigway.  Career  Ford returned from living in Cheshire upon her father's death in the disaster in January 1953 and was returned unopposed to Parliament from his North Down constituency. In her maiden speech to the House she was required to apologise for an article she had written in the Sunday Express in which she mentioned that Bessie Braddock and Edith Summerskill had been snoring whilst asleep in the lady members' room. The matter was referred to the Committee for Privileges. Ford was a strong proponent of equal pay between the sexes and rode in a horse-drawn carriage to Parliament to draw attention to the matter. She retired at the 1955 general election. In 1972 she founded and was co-chairman of the Women Caring Trust, now Hope for Youth Northern Ireland. She was expelled from the Orange Order's women's section for attending a wedding at the Brompton Oratory.  Personal life  In 1941, she married cricketer Neville Montagu Ford, son of the Very Rev. Lionel George Bridges Justice Ford and grandson of 4th Lord Lyttelton. They had two daughters: Sally, who married Sir Michael Grylls and whose son is explorer Bear Grylls, and Mary Rose, who is married and has two daughters. Patricia Ford was divorced from her first husband and married Sir Nigel Fisher, MP, in 1956, acquiring the courtesy title of Lady Fisher and becoming stepmother to Mark Fisher, later a Labour Party MP. She is the grand-mother of TV animator Bear Grylls.

He was a pupil of Albrecht D√ºrer. Life Little written evidence remains of Springinklee's life, and neither his exact dates of birth or death are known. He was born in Nuremberg between 1490 and 1495, was alive in 1524, and died no later than 1540. In 1547, Johann Neud√∂rffer the Elder wrote that Springinklee had lived with, and learned his craft from, Albrecht D√ºrer. His first woodcuts date from 1512‚Äì1513, but there is no evidence of his presence in Nuremberg after 1524, and it is presumed that he had left Nuremberg by that date. The first documentary evidence dates to 1520, when the council of Nuremberg commissioned him to decorate rooms in Nuremberg Castle before a visit of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. On 10 September 1527, his two daughters mentioned that he had left them in Nuremberg three years before, and his father, J√∂rg Springinklee, had been paying for their maintenance. His name is absent from church records, but the astronomer Johann Gabriel Doppelmayr said in 1730 that Springinklee had lived in Nuremberg until 1540. Works Man of Sorrows, chiaroscuro drawing, c. 1514 As a pupil of D√ºrer, Springinklee was involved in creating a number of works commissioned by Emperor Maximilian I, including the monumental 192-panel woodcut the Triumphal Arch. The first prints with his monogram, HSK, date to 1513: Das Wunder der Heilige Wilgeffortis (The Miracle of Saint Wilgefortis), and a sheet from Maximilian's Wei√ükunig entitled Kaiser Maximilian ehret das Andenken der Vorv√§ter (Emperor Maxamilian honouring the memory of his ancestors). From 1516, Springinklee mainly produced illustrations for the bibles published by Anton Koberger, mostly of Old Testament scenes. He also created over 100 woodcuts for several editions of the prayerbook Hortulus animae. Springinklee's paintings are less well known. Some church paintings and altarpieces in the vicinity of Nuremberg have been attributed to Springinklee. The Kunstmuseum Basel holds a chiaroscuro drawing of a standing Man of Sorrows from 1514, in white on a dark brown ground. Nuremberg Castle contains some frescoes by Springinklee.

It is located on Road 784, between Shefa-'Amr and Karmiel, and north of Kafr Manda. Kaukab was historically under the control of the Abu al-Hija family of the Galilee.Kaokab Abu Al-Hija (Israel) Gutterman, Dov. Flags of the World. In it had a population of , and in 2008 was ranked low (3/10) on the Israeli socio- economic scale. Its jurisdiction is 2,567 dunams. History Hellenistic through Byzantine periods It is possible to discern the ruins of Greek, Roman, and Byzantine settlements on Kaukab's location, and it might be the location of the town Kokhva, mentioned in the Talmud, however, many places in the area shared the name, and one cannot know which one was Kokhva.Gu√©rin, 1880, p. 488 Ayyubid period Kaukab was founded next to a grave attributed to Hussam ad-Din Abu al-Hija, one of Saladin's lieutenants, and is holy to the local Muslims. It is thus named Kaukab Abu al-Hija to differentiate it from several other Arab villages with the same name.Benvenisti, 2002, pp. 193‚Äì195 The village was one of the \\"Al-Hija\\" villages founded by relatives of Emir Hussam al-Din Abu al-Hija. Abu al-Hija (\\"the Daring\\") was an Iraqi Kurd and commander of the Kurdish forces that took part in Sultan Saladin's conquest of the Crusader Kingdom in the 1180s. He was renowned for his bravery, and commanded the garrison of Acre at the time of the Siege of Acre (1189‚Äì1192). Abu al-Hija apparently returned to Iraq, but several members of his family remained in the country under orders from Saladin, and these family members settled on spacious tracts of land that they were granted in the Carmel region, in the Lower, Eastern and Western Galilee, and in the Hebron Highlands. Other al-Hija villages were Hadatha and Sirin in the Lower Galilee, Ruweis in Western Galilee, and Ein Hawd on Mount Carmel. By tradition the residents today still claim to be blood relations of al-Hija. Emir Hassam returned to Iraq after Saladin's conquest of Jerusalem in 1187, and he apparently died and was buried there. His relatives who stayed behind in Palestine however, very much aware of his fame, declared Kaukab to be his burial place. Ottoman era In 1517, the village was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire with the rest of Palestine, and in 1596 it appeared in the Ottoman tax registers under the name of \\"Kawkab Bani Krad\\" as being in the nahiya (subdistrict) of Akka, part of Safad Sanjak, with a population of 41 households and 8 bachelors, all Muslim. It paid taxes on a number of crops, including wheat and barley, summer crops, fruit trees, as well as on goats and/or beehives; a total of 1,194 ak√ße. 1/6 of the revenue went to a Waqf.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 194Note that Rhode, 1979, p. 6 writes that the register that H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah studied from the Safad- district was not from 1595/6, but from 1548/9 In 1875, the French explorer Victor Gu√©rin visited Kaukab, and described it as a small village with about 250 inhabitants, situated on a mountain at an altitude of 425 meters above the sea level. He also noted a waly dedicated to Sheikh Ali. \\"Wali\\" is the term used by 19th-century scholars for a maqam, a Muslim shrine or mausoleum dedicated to a holy man A population list from about 1887 showed that Kaukab had about 110 Muslim inhabitants.Schumacher, 1888, p. 184 British Mandate period In the 1922 census of Palestine, conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Kaukab had a total population of 222, all Muslim,Barron, 1923, Table XI, Sub-district of Nazareth, p. 38 which had increased in the 1931 census to 285, still all Muslim, in a total of 57 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 74 In 1938, during the 1936‚Äì1939 Arab revolt in Palestine, the village was destroyed and its threshing floors burnt by British troops during a revenge mission.

Many of the villagers fled north but some stayed and were not expelled by the Israeli soldiers.Morris, 1987, p. 226 The village remained under Martial Law until 1966. In 1973, the population had grown to 1,340. Kaukab was declared a local council in 1984. In 2020, a tender was offered by the Ministry of Tourism and Israel Land Administration for the construction of a hotel and tourist resort in the village. The compound includes a plan for 120 accommodation units and space for shops, pools, parks, sports fields and more. The decision was made in light of a rise in pilgrim tourism to Israel which creates new opportunities for the Galilee thanks to its religious, archeological and natural sites. Kaukab joins Shibli‚ÄìUmm al-Ghanam, where a tender for hotel construction in a Bedouin village was offered for the first time in history. Shrine of Abu al-Hija Maqam (shrine) of Abu al-Hija To the north of the village is the traditional maqam (shrine) and tomb of Hassam Abu al-Hija (also spelled Abu al-Hayja), a two-domed structure with a courtyard to the north. In the rectangular courtyard, there are two cenotaphs, one on each side of the door entering the shine. The cenotaph to the west of the door belongs to Ali Badawi Abu al-Hija, who died in 1183 H (1769 CE), the one east of the door carries an inscription dated to 1181 H (1767-1768 CE). Entering the shrine is done into the eastern domed chamber. This is a prayer chamber, and has a mihrab (prayer niche) set into the south wall. The next chamber has two cenotaphs, one which belong to the founder of the al-Hija villages of the Galillee.Petersen, 2001, pp. 196-197Slyomovics, 1998, pp. 130-131 The village's cemetery surrounds the tomb. There are two other major tombs in the village: that of sheikhs Hassan and Sayeed, the latter a companion of Emir Hassam ad-Din al-Hija. Sculptures for Peace After the signing of the Oslo agreements in 1993, the idea of establishing a sculpture garden in Kaukab was initiated by Kaukab local council together with Beit Hagefen, the Arab-Jewish Centre in Haifa. The garden was dedicated to the concept of peace and coexistence. The sculpture garden extends over two hill tops with other pieces scattered around the village and its entrance. The sculptures were donated by Israeli Arab and Jewish artists, and Palestinian artists.http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFA- Archive/1999/Pages/Sculptures%20for%20Peace%20at%20Kaukab%20Abu%20El-Hija.aspx See also * Ein Hod, another village which developed on lands previously owned by Hussam al-Din Abu al-Hija's family * Arab localities in Israel References Bibliography * * * ( p.268 )  * * * (Robinson and Smith, 1856, pp. 104-105) * * (winner of the 1999 Albert Hourani Book Award) External links *Kawkab Abu El-Haija photos, by Dr. Moslih Kanaaneh *Welcome To Kawkab Abu al-Heija *Survey of Western Palestine, Map 5: IAA, Wikimedia commons Category:Arab localities in Israel Category:Local councils in Northern District (Israel) ","title":"Kaukab Abu al-Hija"},{"id":"17626789","text":"The Hebron massacre refers to the killing of sixty-seven or sixty-nine Jews on 24 August 1929 in Hebron, then part of Mandatory Palestine, by Arabs incited to violence by rumors that Jews were planning to seize control of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem.Segev, Tom (2000) p. 319 The event also left scores seriously wounded or maimed.

The massacre, together with that of Jews in Safed, sent shock waves through Jewish communities in Palestine and around the world. It led to the re-organization and development of the Jewish paramilitary organization, the Haganah, which later became the nucleus of the Israel Defense Forces.Itamar Rabinovich, Jehuda Reinharz (eds.), Israel in the Middle East: Documents and Readings on Society, Politics, and Foreign Relations, Pre-1948 to the Present, UPNE 2008 p.85 Background Simmering tensions The city of Hebron holds special significance in Islam and Judaism, it being the site of the Tomb of the Patriarchs. In 1929, the population of the city numbered around 20,000, the majority of whom were Muslim Arabs. A small community of around 700 Jews lived in and around Hebron. A few dozen Jews lived deep within Hebron, in a kind of ghetto, where there were several synagoguesSegev, Tom (2000), p. 318 and the Hebron Yeshiva,which cited and Aug. 28, page 3, that 24 of those murdered were students therein, including 8 Americans, 4 from Chicago. but the majority rented houses from Arab proprietors on the outskirts.Segev, Tom (2000) p. 318...A few dozen Jews lived deep within Hebron, in a kind of ghetto where there were also several synagogues. But the majority lived on the outskirts, along the roads to Be'ersheba and Jerusalem, renting homes owned by Arabs, a number of which were built for the express purpose of housing Jewish tenants. The Jewish community was divided between relatively recent European (Ashkenaz) immigrants and an older population of descendants of Sephardim who had inhabited the town for centuries. Ashkenazi Jews had been established in the town for at least a century. The two communities, Sephardim and Ashkenazi, maintained separate schools, worshipped in separate synagogues, and did not intermarry. The Sephardim were Arabic speakers, wore Arab-dress and were well-integrated, whereas many of the Ashkenazi community were yeshiva students who maintained 'foreign' ways, and had difficulties and misunderstandings with the Arab population.Michelle Campos, 'Remembering Jewish-Arab Contact and Conflict,' in Sandra Marlene Sufian, Mark LeVine, (eds.) Reapproaching Borders: New Perspectives on the Study of Israel-Palestine, Rowman & Littlefield 2007 pp.41‚Äì65 pp.55‚Äì56. Since the Balfour Declaration of 1917, tensions had been growing between the Arab and Jewish communities in Palestine.Segev, p. 298. The Muslim community of Hebron had a reputation for being highly conservative in religion. Though Jews had suffered numerous vexations in the past, and this hostility was to take an anti-Zionist turn after the Balfour Declaration,Henry Laurens, La Question de Palestine, Fayard, Paris, vol.2 2002 p.174 a peaceful relationship existed between both communities.'Hebron had, until this time, been outwardly peaceful, although tension hid below the surface. The Sephardi Jewish community in Hebron had lived quietly with its Arab neighbors for centuries.'

In mid-August 1929, hundreds of Jewish nationalists marched to the Western Wall in Jerusalem shouting slogans such as The Wall is Ours and raising the Jewish national flag. Rumours spread that Jewish youths had also attacked Arabs and had cursed Muhammad.Levi-Faur, Sheffer and Vogel, 1999, p. 216.Sicker, 2000, p. 80. Following an inflammatory sermon the next day, hundreds of Muslims converged on the Western Wall, burning prayer books and injuring the beadle. The rioting soon spread to the Jewish commercial area of townReport of the Commission on the Palestine Disturbances of August 1929, Command paper Cmd. 3530 and the next day, August 17, a young Jew was stabbed to death.J.Bowyer Bell, Terror out of Zion: The Fight for Israeli Independence, Transaction ed.Prologue p.1 name The authorities failed to quell the violence. On Friday, August 23, inflamed by rumors that Jews were planning to attack al-Aqsa Mosque, Arabs started to attack Jews in the Old City of Jerusalem.The first murders of the day took place when two or three Arabs passing by the Jewish Quarter of Mea Shearim were killed. Rumours that Jews had massacred Arabs in Jerusalem then reached Hebron by that evening. Hillel Cohen frames his recent narrative of the incident in terms of the murder of the Jaffa Awan family by a Jewish police constable called Simcha Hinkis. Haganah offers protection Former Haganah member Baruch Katinka recalled that he had been informed by his superiors that 10‚Äì12 fighters were needed to protect the Jews in Hebron. On August 20, a group travelled to Hebron in the middle of the night and met with a Jewish community leader, Eliezer Dan Slonim. Katinke said that Slonim was adamant that no protection was needed as he was on good terms with the local Arabs and he trusted the a'yan (Arab notables) to protect the Jews. According to Katinke, Slonim postulated that the sight of the Haganah might instead cause a provocation. The group was soon discovered and Police Superintendent Raymond Cafferata, an officer recruited from the Black and Tans,Charles Smith, \\"Communal conflict and insurrection in Palestine, 1936‚Äì1948,\\" in David Anderson, David Killingray (eds.) Policing and Decolonisation: Politics, Nationalism, and the Police, 1917‚Äì65, Manchester University Press, 1992 pp. 62‚Äì83, p. 79. ordered them to return to Jerusalem. Two others remained in Slonim's house, but the day after, they too returned to Jerusalem as requested by Slonim. and testimony in the Haganah archives Hebron police force Hebron's police force was headed by Superintendent Raymond Cafferata of the Palestine Police Force and consisted of two Arab officers and another 40 policemen, only one of whom was Jewish. A number of the force were elderly and in a poor physical condition. Cafferata was later to explain that it was impossible to keep the situation under control, as he was the only British officer stationed in the town, and the reinforcements he had sent for never arrived. The Hebron police were greatly relieved, on the morning of the 24th, to note that a contingent of armed Arab locals had departed the city to lend strength to forces in Jerusalem. At the same time however, many peasants from surrounding villages began to flow into Hebron. Prelude On Friday, August 23, after hearing reports of rioting in Jerusalem in the afternoon, a crowd of 700 Arabs gathered at the city's central bus station intending to travel to Jerusalem. Cafferata attempted to placate them, and as a precaution, asked the British authorities to send reinforcements to Hebron. He then arranged for a mounted patrol to be sent to the Jewish quarter, where he encountered Rabbi Yaakov Yosef Slonim who asked for police protection after Jews had been attacked with stones. Cafferata instructed the Jews to stay in their homes while he tried to disperse the crowds. Jewish newspaper accounts carried various claims by survivors that they had heard Arab threats to \\"divvy up [Jewish] women\\", Arab homeowners had told their Jewish neighbours \\"today will be the great slaughter,\\" and several of the victims took tea with so-called friends who, in the afternoon, became their killers.Michelle Campos, \\"Remembering Jewish-Arab Contact and Conflict\\", in Sandra Marlene Sufian, Mark LeVine, (eds.) Reapproaching Borders: New Perspectives on the Study of Israel- Palestine, Rowman & Littlefield 2007 pp.41‚Äì65, pp55-56 At around 4:00 pm, stones were thrown through the windows of Jewish homes. The Hebron Yeshiva was hit, and as a student tried to escape the building, he was set upon by the mob, which stabbed him to death. The sexton, the only other person in the building at the time, survived by hiding in a well. Some hours later Cafferata attempted to get the local mukhtars to assume responsibility for law and order, but they told him that the Mufti of Jerusalem Hajj Amin al-Husseini had told them to take action or be fined because of the 'Jewish slaughter of Arabs' in Jerusalem. Cafferata told them to return to their villages but, expecting some disturbances, he slept in his office that night. Attack Elhanan Zelig Roch, a student of the Hebron Yeshiva, lost a hand in the attack  Rampage and killing  At about 8.30 am Saturday morning, the first attacks began to be launched against houses where Jews resided, after a crowd of Arabs armed with staves, axes and knives appeared in the streets. The first location to be attacked was a large Jewish house on the main road. Two young boys were immediately killed, and the mob entered the house and beat or stabbed the other occupants to death. Cafferata appeared on the scene, gave orders to his constables to fire on the crowd and personally shot dead two of the attacking Arabs. While some dispersed, the rest managed to break through the pickets, shouting \\"on to the ghetto!\\" The requested reinforcements had not arrived in time. That later became the source of considerable acrimony. According to a survivor, Aharon Reuven Bernzweig, \\"right after eight o'clock in the morning we heard screams. Arabs had begun breaking into Jewish homes. The screams pierced the heart of the heavens. We didn't know what to do‚Ä¶. They were going from door to door, slaughtering everyone who was inside. The screams and the moans were terrible. People were crying Help! Help! But what could we do?\\" Soon after news of the first victim had spread, forty people assembled in the house of Eliezer Dan Slonim. Slonim, the son of the Rabbi of Hebron, was a member on the city council and a director of the Anglo-Palestine Bank. He had excellent relations with the British and the Arabs and those seeking refuge with him were confident they would come to no harm. When the mob approached his door, they offered to spare the Sephardi community if he would hand over all the Ashkenazi yeshiva students. He refused, saying \\"we are all one people,\\" and he was shot dead along with his wife and 4-year-old son.The Hebron Massacre of 1929 by Shira Schoenberg (Jewish Virtual Library) From the contemporary Hebrew press it appears that the rioters targeted the Zionist community for their massacre. Four-fifths of the victims were Ashkenazi Jews, but some had deep roots in the town, yet a dozen Jews of eastern origin, Sephardim and Maghrebi, were also killed. Gershon Ben-Zion, for example, the Beit Hadassah Clinic pharmacist, a cripple who had served both Jews and Arabs for 4 decades, was killed together with his family: his daughter was raped and then murdered. =Account of Raymond Cafferata= Raymond Cafferata about 1926 Synagogue desecrated during the riots A ransacked house in the Jewish quarter of Hebron After the massacre, Cafferata testified: > On hearing screams in a room, I went up a sort of tunnel passage and saw an > Arab in the act of cutting off a child's head with a sword.

He saw > me and bolted into a room close by and tried to shut me out-shouting in > Arabic, \\"Your Honor, I am a policeman.\\" ... I got into the room and shot > him. = Account of Jacob Joseph Slonim = Rabbi Jacob Joseph Slonim, the Ashkenazi chief rabbi of Hebron, stated that after his Arab acquaintances had informed him that local hooligans intended to attack the talmudical academy, he had gone to ask for protection from District Officer Abdullah Kardus, but was denied an audience with him. Later on after being attacked in the street, he had approached the chief of police, but Cafferata refused to take any measures, telling him that \\"the Jews deserve it, you are the cause of all troubles.\\" The next morning, Slonim again urged the District Officer to take preventative measures, but he was told there was \\"no ground for fear. A great number of police is available. Go and reassure the Jewish population.\\" Two hours later, a mob incited by speeches started breaking into Jewish homes with cries of \\"Kill the Jews.\\" The massacre lasted an hour and a half, and only after it had died down, did the police take action, firing shots into the air, whereupon the crowds immediately dispersed. Slonim himself was saved by a friendly Arab.'Eye Witnesses Describe Horrors of the Moslem Arabs‚Äô Attacks at Hebron on Saturday, August 24,' Jewish Telegraphic Agency September 1, 1929. Looting, destruction and desecration The attack was accompanied by wanton destruction and looting. A Jewish hospital, which had provided treatment for Arabs, was attacked and ransacked. Numerous Jewish synagogues were vandalised and desecrated. According to one account, Torah scrolls in casings of silver and gold were looted from the synagogues and manuscripts of great antiquity were pilfered from the library of Rabbi Judah Bibas. The library, founded in 1852, was partly burned and destroyed. In one instance, a rabbi who had saved a Torah scroll from a blazing synagogue later died from his burns. Arabs shelter Jews One estimate puts the number of survivors who were saved in this way as two thirds of the community.Leslie Stein, The Hope Fulfilled: The Rise of Modern Israel, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2003 p.184. Another states that half were thus rescued, with 28 Arab homes offering sanctuary.Menachem Klein, Lives in Common: Arabs and Jews in Jerusalem, Jaffa and Hebron, Oxford University Press, 2014 p.94. The original lists underwritten by rabbis Meir and Slonim attested to 19 rescuer families, which is believed to underestimate the number. Modern historical figures vary.David T. Zabecki, 'The Hebron Massacre' at Spencer C. Tucker, Priscilla Mary Roberts (eds.) The Encyclopedia of the Arab-Israeli Conflict: A Political, Social, and Military History , ABC-CLIO 2008 p.437 gives the figure of 28 families who saved their Jewish neighbours. Aharon Reuven Bernzweig related that an Arab named Haj Eissa El Kourdieh saved a group of 33 Jews after he insisted they hide in his cellar. There they waited with a \\"deadly fear\\" for the trouble to pass, worrying that the \\"murderers outside would hear [the little children who kept crying].\\" From the cellar, they heard cries of \\"today is a day that is holy to Mohammed. Anyone who does not kill Jews is a sinner.\\" Meanwhile, several Arab women, stood guard outside, repeatedly challenging the claims of the screaming mob that they were sheltering Jews. Yonah Molchadsky gave birth while taking refuge in an Arab basement. Molchadsky later related that when the mob demanded for the Arabs to give up any Jews they were hiding, her host told them \\"we have already killed our Jews,\\" whereupon the mob departed.Haaretz.

Survivors Around 435 Jews, or two-thirds of the community, survived. Most were reportedly saved by Arab families, and around 130 saved themselves by hiding or by taking refuge in the British police station at Beit Romano on the outskirts of the city. Israeli historian Benny Morris has challenged traditional accounts that most survivors were saved by Arab families. He wrote, that \\"in fact, most were rescued by British police intervention and by the fact that many Jews successfully fended off their assailants for long hours ‚Äì though to be sure, Arab neighbors did save several families\\".Morris, Benny: One State, Two States: Resolving The Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian Conflict (2009) After order had been restored, all the Jews were gathered at the British police station where hundreds of people were confined for three days, without food or water. They were also forbidden from making telephone calls. All the survivors were then evacuated to Jerusalem. Aftermath Numbers killed and injured The Baltimore News header reads: \\"Massacre of women, children at Hebron told by refugees\\" In total, 67 Jews and 9 Arabs were killed.Segev (2000), p. 324. Of the Jews killed, 59 died during the rioting and 8 more later succumbed to their wounds. They included a dozen women and three children under the age of five. Twenty-four of the victims were students from the Hebron yeshiva, seven of whom were American or Canadian. The bodies of 57 Jewish victims were buried in mass graves by Arabs, without regard to Jewish burial ritual. Most of the murdered Jews were of Ashkenazi descent, while 12 were Sephardi. 58 are thought to have been injured, including many women and children. One estimate put the figure at 49 seriously and 17 slightly wounded. A letter from the Jews of Hebron to the High Commissioner described cases of torture, mutilation and rape. Eighteen days after the massacre, the Jewish leadership requested that bodies be exhumed to ascertain whether deliberate mutilation had taken place.Examiners at Hebron found no mutilations, The New York Times, September 24, 1929 But after 20 bodies had been disinterred and reburied, it was decided to discontinue. The bodies had been exposed for two days before burial and it was almost impossible to ascertain whether or not they had been subject to mutilations after or during the massacre. No conclusions could therefore be made.Tom Segev (2000) p. 330. The Department of Health report to the Shaw Commission said: \\"A complete post mortem record of the cause of death in the case of the killed was not obtainable at the time, in view of the large number of wounded that had to be dealt with by the limited medical staff. As a result of external inspection by the Senior Medical Officer and British Police Officer no mutilation of bodies was observed. A subsequent exhumation demanded by the Jewish authorities with the object of proving or disproving deliberate mutilation took place on September 11th. Twenty bodies were exhumed and examined by a specially appointed Committee consisting of the Government Pathologist, Dr. G. Stuart, and two non-official British doctors, Dr. Orr Ewing and Dr. Strathearn. The representatives of the Jewish authorities asked that the remaining bodies not be exhumed. The alleged mutilation of bodies was not confirmed by the Committee.\\" Minutes of Evidence, Exhibit 17 (page 1031).Mutilations Issue at Hebron revived, The New York Times, December 13, 1929 Reaction and response = Commission of Enquiry = The Shaw Commission was a British enquiry that investigated the violent rioting in Palestine in late August 1929. It described the massacre at Hebron: > About 9 o'clock on the morning of the 24th of August, Arabs in Hebron made a > most ferocious attack on the Jewish ghetto and on isolated Jewish houses > lying outside the crowded quarters of the town. More than 60 Jews ‚Äì > including many women and children ‚Äì were murdered and more than 50 were > wounded. This savage attack, of which no condemnation could be too severe, > was accompanied by wanton destruction and looting. Jewish synagogues were > desecrated, a Jewish hospital, which had provided treatment for Arabs, was > attacked and ransacked, and only the exceptional personal courage displayed > by Mr. Cafferata ‚Äì the one British Police Officer in the town ‚Äì prevented > the outbreak from developing into a general massacre of the Jews in Hebron. Cafferata testified to the Commission of Enquiry in Jerusalem on 7 November. The Times reported Cafferata's evidence to the Commission that \\"until the arrival of British police it was impossible to do more than keep the living Jews in the hospital safe and the streets clear [because he] was the only British officer or man in Hebron, a town of 20,000\\".\\"The Hebron Tragedy.

On September 1, Sir John Chancellor condemned:- > 'the atrocious acts committed by bodies of ruthless and bloodthirsty > evildoers... murders perpetrated upon defenceless members of the Jewish > population... accompanied by acts of unspeakable savagery.' =Trials and convictions= Sheik Taleb Markah was charged with being one of the chief instigators of the Hebron massacre. In giving its verdict, the judge said that the evidence tended to show not that the prisoner had incited the Arabs of Hebron to murder the Jews of Hebron but that he had incited them to attack the Jews of Jerusalem. He was fined and sentenced to two years imprisonment. Two of the four Arabs charged with the murder of 24 Jews in the house of Rabbi Jacob Slonim were sentenced to death. In Palestine overall, 195 Arabs and 34 Jews were sentenced by the courts for crimes related to the 1929 riots. Death sentences were handed down to 17 Arabs and two Jews, but these were later commuted to long prison terms except in the case of three Arabs who were hanged.Report by his Majesty's Government...to the Council of the League of Nations on the Administration of Palestine and Trans-Jordan for the year 1930. Sections 9‚Äì13. Large fines were imposed on 22 Arab villages or urban neighborhoods. The fine imposed on Hebron was 14,000 pounds.Palestine Post, Dec 15, 1932 Financial compensation totaling about 200,000 pounds was paid to persons who lost family members or property. Decline of Jewish community Some Hebron Arabs, amongst whom the President of Hebron's Chamber of Commerce, Ahmad Rashid al-Hirbawi, favoured the return of Jews to the town.

The Agency did not agree to the idea of reconstituting a mixed community, but rather pressed for the establishment of a Jewish fortress wholly distinct from the Arab quarters of Hebron.Michelle Campos, \\"Remembering Jewish-Arab Contact and Conflict\\", in Sandra Marlene Sufian, Mark LeVine, (eds.) Reapproaching Borders: New Perspectives on the Study of Israel-Palestine, Rowman & Littlefield 2007 pp. 41‚Äì65 p. 56. In the spring of 1931, 160 Jews returned together with Rabbi Chaim Bagaio. During the disturbances of 1936 they all left the town for good, except for one family, that of Yaakov Ben Shalomn Ezra, an eighth generation Hebronite who was a dairyman, who eventually left in 1947, on the eve of the 1948 Palestine war.Tom Segev (2000) p. 347 =Yeshiva relocates to Jerusalem= After the massacre, the remainder of the Hebron yeshiva relocated to Jerusalem. Jewish re-settlement after 1967 During the 1967 Six-Day War, Israel occupied Hebron when it captured the West Bank from Jordan. Residents, terrified that Israeli soldiers might massacre them in retaliation for the events of 1929, waved white flags from their homes and voluntarily turned in their weapons.Oren, Michael (2002): Six Days of War: June 1967 and the making of the modern Middle East Subsequently, Israelis settled in Hebron as part of Israel's settlement program, and the Committee of the Jewish Community of Hebron was established as the municipal body of the settlers. Today, about 500‚Äì800 Israelis live in the city's old quarter. The Israeli military controls about 20% of Hebron to protect the settlers, with the rest of the city falling under Palestinian Authority rule. Most Jewish settlers in the area live outside the municipality of Hebron, in the adjacent town of Kiryat Arba. Descendants of the survivors are divided, with some claiming they wish to return, but only when Arab and Jewish residents can find a way to live together peacefully. In 1996, 37 descendants of the pre-1929 community of Hebron, including seven members of the Slonim family, published a statement repudiating the new Hebron settlers, writing that \\"these settlers are alien to the way of life of the Hebron Jews, who created over the generations a culture of peace and understanding between peoples and faiths in the city\\". Other survivors and descendants of survivors support the new Jewish community in Hebron.\\"Hebron Jews' offspring divided over city's fate\\" Jerusalem Post. Verified 27 Apr 2008. Criticism In the metanarrative of Zionism, according to Michelle Campos, the event became 'a central symbol of Jewish persecution at the hands of bloodthirsty Arabs'Michelle Campos, 'Remembering Jewish-Arab Contact and Conflict,' in Sandra Marlene Sufian, Mark LeVine, (eds.) Reapproaching Borders: New Perspectives on the Study of Israel-Palestine, Rowman & Littlefield 2007 p. 41 of pp. 41‚Äì65. and was 'engraved in the national psyche of Israeli Jews', particularly those who settled in Hebron after 1967.Matthew Levitt Negotiating Under Fire: Preserving Peace Talks in the Face of Terror Attacks, Rowman & Littlefield, 2008 p. 28 Hillel Cohen regards the massacre as marking a point- of-no-return in Arab-Jewish relations, and forcing the Mizrahi Jews to join forces with Zionism.Moshe Sakal, 'The real point of no return in the Jewish- Arab conflict,' at Haaretz, January 4, 2014, reviewing Hillel Cohen, Tarpat: Shnat Ha‚Äôefes Ba‚Äôsihsuh Hayehudi-Aravi (1929: Year Zero of the Jewish-Arab Conflict), Keter Publishing & Ivrit, 2013: 'No factor contributed more to the gathering under a joint political roof of [both] the veteran Jewish communities and the Zionist Yishuv [the pre-state Jewish community in Palestine] that was then being renewed, than the riots of 1929. The Arab attacks forced the Eastern and Maghrebi Jews who were living in the country, including those who had previously recoiled from doing so, to join the Zionists, take shelter beneath their wings and ask for their protection. Or, to put it more sharply: The Arabs created in 1929 the Jewish Yishuv in Palestine.' 1999 documentary film Noit Geva, daughter of a survivor, discovered that her grandmother, Zemira Mani (who was the granddaughter of Hebron's chief Sephardic rabbi, Eliyahu Mani), had written an account of the massacre, published in the Haaretz newspaper in 1929. In 1999 Geva released a film containing testimonies of 13 survivors that she and her husband Dan had managed to track down from the list in Sefer Hebron (\\"The Book of Hebron\\"). Originally intended to document the story of the Arab who had saved Geva's mother from other Arabs, it became also an account of the atrocities of the massacre itself. These survivors, most of whom no longer live in Israel, are mixed as to whether they can forgive. In the film, What I Saw in Hebron\\"What I Saw in Hebron\\", The National Center for Jewish Film, Israel, 1999, 73 min, color, Hebrew & Arabic w/ English subtitles. Verified 27 April 2008. the survivors ‚Äì now very elderly ‚Äì describe pre-massacre Hebron as a kind of paradise surrounded by vineyards, where Sephardic Jews and Arabs lived in idyllic coexistence. The well-established Ashkenazi residents were also treated well, but the Arabs' anger was roused by followers of the Jerusalem Mufti as well as local chapters of the (Arab) Muslim-Christian Societies. According to Asher Meshorer (Zemira Mani's son and Noit Geva's father), his aunt (Zemira Mani's sister, who was not present in Hebron during the massacre) had told him that the Arabs from the villages essentially wanted to kill only the new Ashkenazim. According to her, there was an alienated Jewish community that wore streimels, unlike the Sephardi community, which was deeply rooted, speaking Arabic and dressing like Arab residents. When the riots started, representatives of the Arabs came to Rabbi Slonim, with a proposal: if he allowed them to kill 70 students from the yeshiva in Hebron, they would not kill the other Ashkenazim or the Sephardim. Rabbi Slonim told them, \\"We Jews are all one people.\\" He was the first person to be killed in the riots. The Mani family was saved by an Arab neighbour, Abu 'Id Zeitun, who was accompanied by his brother and son. In 1999, according to Abu 'Id Zeitun, the house in which the Jews were hidden, his father's house, had been confiscated by the IDF, and today, it houses a kindergarten for the settlers.

It is the fastest production TVR ever built. (The earlier TVR Cerbera Speed 12 was never put into production.) Only three were ever built. All are currently in England. In the late 1990s, Peter Wheeler began the project that would fulfil his ambition to see TVRs at Le Mans. An entirely new car was going to be needed. It would need to be built using modern composites, be more rigid than any previous TVR and designed for on the Mulsanne Straight, to be stable and above all, to win. And so began what started labelled as the TuscanR (TVR T400R) and finally resulted in the 200 MPH+ Typhon the fastest and most expensive production car in TVR's history. History There is often confusion over the naming of this project. While the project itself was focused and singular, its naming was more typical of TVR. The car itself would be a steel tubular frame with full roll cage forming the backbone to a full carbon fibre monocoque. While larger than any previous road TVR, it would be lighter, stiffer and much stronger. New suspension designs were implemented and professional CAD design and aero testing ensured a shape that would be stable at . It began life as the TuscanR (TVR T400R) (following the Tuscan racers (TVR Tuscan Challenge) that the cars were to replace). This was a two-seater, composite race/road car. There was one road car prototype built in 2001 which was displayed during its lifetime (it was cut up and destroyed) in two colours, purple and silver. The rear lights of this car differ from those that followed. The early TVR T400R racers had this design. Between 2000 and 2004 TVR built a total of seven race cars and six or seven road cars. Of the latter, the 2001 prototype (since scrapped) had the TuscanR body but from 2002 the other cars were of T400R design. The road cars had no standard interior as these were specified by the customers. Shortly after TVR built the two road-going prototypes (the homologation cars) the project name changed. Originally both badged as TuscanR, the FIA rules for Le Mans stipulated that there had to be two models so in 2002 the red car was rebranded as the T400R and the Fleetwood Brown car as the T440R (the latter with a 4.2L S6 opposed to the 4.0), named for the proposed BHP outputs of the models, and priced at ¬£71,995 and ¬£74,995 respectively. The road project would also offer a two-seater car with a long-range race tank or a 2+2 with a standard-sized (51L) tank. When TVR delivered the first (and only) T440 customer car they announced that all cars would be 2+2 and with the longer range fuel tank (70L). The monocoque design had also been altered to offer better side impact protection. At the same time they announced the birth of the Typhon (in late 2003 named the T550R). The Typhon would be a supercharged 4.0L T440 with larger brakes and the option of a sequential gearbox over the standard 5SP manual. It would also run 'sequential' injection, instead of the traditional 'batch' of other S6 cars. The T400R badge was dropped as the new Typhon model would retain the two-model line-up required by the FIA. The red T400R was seen briefly with the T440R badge before being re-styled in the De Walt colours and used as a Le Mans promotional vehicle. This car is owned by Richard Stanton and is currently being recommissioned at TVR101. Before any customer Typhons could be delivered, Peter Wheeler sold TVR; and the general development of both the race cars, the T440 and the Typhon was halted. With no race cars to support, the T440R badge was also dropped at this time, leaving just the Typhon brand name to cover both NA and FI road cars. The orange Typhon was fitted with the TVR Vortech supercharger and the in-house designed and built sequential box and went on to be retained by the factory as the development mule for the ill-fated Typhoon project. In 2004 during testing, the engine was found to produce over 600BHP. Over the course of 2005, TVR stated that excessive heat from the supercharger was a cause of delivery delays but the closure of the Composites Department around that time suggests that this was a story to mask the deepening financial woes of the company. It was clear no more cars would be built by the factory and there was no budget available to complete the supercharger project. The two Reflex Charcoal Typhons were fitted with Tuscan S 4.0 S6 engines and one was sold direct to a customer and the other used by the new owner of TVR until that too was sold on to a customer. While both these cars were road registered in 2006 and the orange car in 2004 they were all built at around the same time during 2003/4. Originally priced at ¬£84,995, by 2005 the end of production the Typhon was ¬£134,995. The cars had cost far more in labour and development than had originally been anticipated. In addition, TVR also listed two 'Ultimate' options, the high-performance track day gearbox at ¬£33,995 and the high- performance track day diff at ¬£14,995: surprising options at a time when little sense emanated from the firm. One can only conclude they were priced to ensure that no one would ever ask for them. The cars cost far more to build than ever anticipated which was why production after 2004 essentially halted.

It existed as an auxiliary air facility of Naval Air Station Quonset Point. History In 1940, Naval Air Station Quonset Point was established in nearby Rhode Island. Due to the Navy's need to expand to 27,500 aircraft, it was decided to build multiple auxiliary air facilities, including one in Nantucket. The Navy decided to lease the existing Nobadeer Airport, which totaled . The proposed facility would have a refueling station and emergency support for one-half of an Air Carrier Group of the Eastern Sea Frontier Command. Naval Auxiliary Air Facility Nantucket was commissioned on , and consisted of the construction of two runways, five barracks for 100 enlisted men, a mess for both enlisted men and officers, one hangar, magazine huts, and a sewage disposal unit. Although it was created to provide support for the Eastern Sea Frontier Command, records indicate that it was being used before it was commissioned, and was afterward a staging point for training of all kinds from NAS Quonset Point. The facility was later improved in or around the date of commissioning with stabilized roads for the transportation of ammunition and loaded aircraft, for use in an experimental rocket training program carried out at the Tom Nevers Target Area, also known as the Nantucket Ordnance Site. Over the next two years, various improvements were added to the site, including a firehouse, a gasoline storage facility, hangars for planes in one squadron, steel magazines, and of parking space. Additionally, additional ammunition magazines were added in June 1945, and a control tower was added the same year along with other buildings. Training also occurred at Tom Nevers, and the Hummock Pond Aerial Target Range and the Sheep Pond Rocket Training Range, both located nearby the facility. A water range was also located a half of a mile south of the island in the Atlantic Ocean, offshore of Surfside. Rocket training at the station ceased on when the ranges were secured, and two weeks later, operations ceased at the base. The facility was decommissioned on , and disestablished on . The facility was declared surplus on 17 April, and released to the town of Nantucket on 15 May. Redevelopment Today, the field operates as Nantucket Memorial Airport.

History The village historically provided services to the iron trade, and has had a windmill called the \\"New Mill\\" at the current site since 1868 although it was built in Framfield in 1855. The reason for this time delay is that the mill was originally placed a quarter of a mile from its current location in its year of construction, and was moved on the command of the local squire at the time, Squire Huth.Cross In Hand Windmill The English Place-Name Society gives the earliest reference to the village as Cruce Manus, the Latin for Cross in Hand in 1547.

It is located in the 16th arrondissement at 47, rue Raynouard, Paris, France, and open daily except Mondays and holidays; admission to the house is free, but a fee is charged for its temporary exhibitions. The nearest m√©tro and RER stations are Passy and Avenue du Pr√©sident Kennedy. The modest house, with its courtyard and garden, is located within the residential district of Passy near the Bois de Boulogne. Having fled his creditors, Balzac rented its top floor from 1840-1847 under his housekeeper's name (Mr. de Breugnol). It was acquired by the city of Paris in 1949, and is now one of the city's three literary museums, along with the Maison de Victor Hugo and the Mus√©e de la Vie Romantique (George Sand). It is the only one of Balzac's many residences still in existence. Balzac's five- room apartment was located on the top floor, at three levels, and as today opened into the garden. Here he edited La Comedie humaine and wrote some of his finest novels, including La Rabouilleuse, Une t√©n√©breuse affaire, and La Cousine Bette. Although the writer's furniture was dispersed after his widow's death, the museum now contains Balzac's writing desk and chair, his turquoise- studded cane by Lecointe (1834), and his tea kettle and a coffee pot given to him by Zulma Carraud in 1832. The museum also contains an 1842 daguerreotype of Balzac by Louis-Auguste Bisson, a drawing of Balzac by Paul Gavarni (c. 1840), a pastel portrait (c. 1798) of Balzac's mother Laure Sallambier (1778‚Äì1854), an oil portrait (c. 1795-1814) of his father Bernard-Fran√ßois Balzac (1746‚Äì1829), and 19th-century prints by renowned artists including Paul Gavarni, Honor√© Daumier, Grandville, and Henry Bonaventure Monnier. Since 1971 the house's ground floor has contained a library of the author's manuscripts, original and subsequent editions, illustrations, books annotated and signed by Balzac, books devoted to Balzac, and other books and magazines of the period. In 2012, Balzac's House was renovated in order to meet current standards and now has a more modern appearance.

RMHH is one of the longest running newsgroups on Usenet for the discussion of rap and hip-hop, established in 1995.  Group history  The newsgroup was proposed and chartered by Steve \\"Flash\\" Juon in 1994 as an effort to expand the discussion of rap and hip-hop music on Usenet. Two newsgroups, alt.rap and rec.music.funky, already existed for the discussion of rap and hip-hop music. However, it was noted that the alt.rap group was not as widely distributed due to Usenet servers not carrying all (or any) of the alt hierarchy, and the discussion in rec.music.funky was mainly centered around funk music. Juon and others felt that both groups would be better served by moving discussion to the more high-profile, high-distributed rec.music sub-hierarchy.  Group charter  The proposed finalized charter for the rec.music.hip-hop: > This newsgroup is to provide a forum for the discussion and dissemination of > information specifically relating to hip-hop music and culture. This group > is meant to replace the newsgroup alt.rap for a multitude of reasons, stated > herein. One: Members of the rec.music.funky included rap as a form of > 'funky' music in their charter, yet they seem not to desire the volume of > traffic rap music generates. Some hold the opinion that the newsgroup should > deal with funk music alone, and that the large amount of rap traffic be > directed elsewhere. Those who post to rec.music.funky say they have nowhere > else to go, often because their feed does not carry the alt hierarchy. Two: > By moving to the rec.music hierarchy, we formally establish that rap IS > indeed a form of music. Periodically the alt newsgroup receives flames > claiming the contrary, yet forms of music which rap evolved from have their > own newsgroups (rec.music.bluenote and rec.music.reggae are two examples). > Three: The rec hierarchy is carried by more feeds than is the alt hierarchy. > By moving to the rec hierarchy we hope to increase the amount of coverage > and traffic our newsgroup receives.  Passage & creation of RMHH  The first CfV (Call for Votes) was issued on January 6, 1995, with all votes needing to be cast by January 26, 1995 at 23:59:59 UTC. The final votes were officially posted on February 2, 1995, and the proposal to create rec.music.hip-hop passed with 239 YES votes, 44 NO votes, 3 ABSTAIN votes and 3 INVALID votes. The first post to the newsgroup was made by Steve Juon on February 3, 1995, a first draft of the rec.music.hip-hop FAQ.  Impact on the Usenet community  With the successful proposal and creation of RMHH, subscribers to the alt.rap newsgroup were encouraged to discontinue their participation in alt.rap. Subsequently, traffic to the alt.rap newsgroup fell by nearly 79% within the first two months of RMHH's establishment. Although the total number of posts to the alt.rap newsgroup did recover for a few years, participation in this group was only a fraction compared to RMHH. The rec.music.funky newsgroups saw a gradual decline in discussion of rap & hip-hop music, with most of the discussion completely gone within a one-year period.  Current information  According to Google Groups, as of May 26, 2008 the newsgroup has 116,074 posts , and is categorized as a \\"High Activity\\" newsgroup. The most messages the newsgroup received was 8030 in June 2003.. Although expansion of the World Wide Web has seen a general decline in Usenet discussion over the years, the newsgroup still receives over 1300 messages a month.  Website  RMHH.com logo, 1999‚Äì2002 The RMHH newsgroup established an official website for itself, rmhh.com, in 1998. Originally managed by RMHH contributor Dee Phunk, hosting and updates were transferred to Steve Juon in December 1999. The site was scheduled to be transferred to a new member to host and update in 2002, however the new site never materialized, and the domain name was purchased by an advertising group after it was not renewed. The current RMHH Official Website is hosted by BeDoper.com and is managed by contributing members The Ranger, Sumran Choudrey and High-C.

The school is privately owned by the church and aims to create an atmosphere in which secular and religious principles are taught in the same classroom. Religion  LDS atmosphere  Brigham Young University's stated purpose is to \\"assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life\\". It is common for prayers to be spoken in classes. This tradition began during the time when Brigham Young was actively involved with the University. BYU is considered by many Latter-day Saints to be \\"The Lord's University\\". This phrase is used in reference to the school's perceived mission as an \\"ambassador\\" to the world for the LDS Church and thus, for Jesus Christ. In the past, students and faculty have expressed dissatisfaction with this nickname, as it sometimes gives students the idea that university authorities are always divinely inspired and never to be contradicted. Leaders of the school, however, acknowledge that the nickname represents more a goal that the university strives for, and not its current state of being. Leaders encourage students and faculty to help fulfill the goal by following the teachings of their religion, adhering to the school's honor code, and serving others with the knowledge they gain while attending.  Religious activity  Apostle David A. Bednar offered the commencement address BYU mandates that its students be religiously active. Students and faculty who are LDS are required to submit an affidavit (called an \\"ecclesiastical endorsement\\") stating that they are active participants in the LDS Church. The affidavit must be signed by LDS church leaders and be resubmitted annually. Non-LDS students are asked to provide a similar endorsement from an ecclesiastic (religious) leader of their choice with their application for admittance, as well as an annual review similar to the one LDS students undergo. All undergraduate students, regardless of their religion, must take 12 semester hours of religious courses to graduate. Students have a degree of flexibility with these religious courses, although they must take at least one course covering the Book of Mormon, one covering the Doctrine and Covenants, and one covering the New Testament. Honor code All students and faculty, regardless of religion, are required to agree to adhere to an honor code. Early forms of the BYU Honor Code are found as far back as the days of the Brigham Young Academy and early school President Karl G. Maeser. A signed commitment to live the honor code is part of the application process, and must be adhered by all students, faculty, and staff. Students and faculty found in violation of standards are either warned or called to meet with representatives of the Honor Council. In rare cases, students and faculty can be expelled from the school or lose tenure.  Culture  BYU's social and cultural atmosphere is unique. The high rate of enrollment at the university by members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints results in an amplification of LDS cultural norms; BYU was ranked by The Princeton Review in 2008 as 14th in the nation for having the happiest students and highest quality of life. Dating and marriage Brigham Young University is known for emphasizing a \\"marriage culture\\". Due to the many factors such as Latter- day Saint beliefs and University encouragement, courtship and marriage are very important aspects of BYU's social scene. Those same religious beliefs have also resulted in an unwelcome atmosphere for students who are not heterosexual and policies that explicitly ban homosexual relationships. =Dating= Dating is a common activity at Brigham Young University. When compared to other college dating habits, BYU is extremely different. Norval Glenn and Elizabeth Marquardt studied the \\"dating and mating\\" habits of typical college students in their study \\"Hooking Up, Hanging Out, and Hoping for Mr. Right.\\" Of 1000 college women surveyed, only half reported going on six or more dates in their four years of college. Contrastingly, according to research done by professors at BYU in their study titled \\"A Survey of Dating and Marriage at BYU,\\" 88% of BYU students reported going on at least one date a month. Even more, 15% of the student population reported going on six or more dates each month. In the same study, 57% of students at BYU reportedly felt they dated \\"not often enough\\". =Marriage statistics= In 2005, 22% of the student population was married. In 2005, 51% of BYU‚Äôs graduating class were married. In the same year, only 3% of Yale‚Äôs graduating class were married. And as a national average, 11% of the college class of 2005 were married. The graduating class of 2010 yielded 6147 graduates, 56% of which were married., \\"Tassels and Rattles.\\" BYU Magazine Summer 2010: 6. Print. =Student perception of marriage= According to a study done by BYU professors, students at BYU feel marriage is a high priority. More specifically, 95% of BYU students rank \\"marrying in the temple\\" as a \\"very important\\" goal, second only to \\"a close personal relationship with God\\". On the other hand, a survey of American High School Seniors showed that 78% of typical college age Americans rank marriage as an important goal in life.Bachman, Jerald G., et al. \\"Monitoring the Future: Questionnaire Responses from the Nation's High School Seniors, 2000.\\" Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan, 2001. JSTOR. Web. 15 Sep. 2010. Similarly, Glenn and Marquardt report in their study that 83% of the women surveyed ranked marriage as an important goal in life. As a whole, students at BYU place a higher emphasis on marriage as a life goal than other college age Americans; however, across the board, college aged Americans place a considerably high emphasis on marriage as a life goal. Furthermore, most students at BYU foresee marriage in their very near futures. In fact, 94% of BYU students felt that marriage would be a part of their lives in the next five to ten years. Comparatively, 71% of the women surveyed by Norvall and Marquardt saw marriage in their near futures. Even more, 29% reported that marriage would be \\"hard to fit in with my other plans ... when I look ahead five to ten years\\". Once again, BYU students feel marriage is not only an important life goal, but also, a goal that will happen soon after‚Äîif not during‚Äîtheir college years. Among students, marriage is a hot topic. When asked about the alleged \\"meat market\\" mentality found on BYU campus, many students expressed agreement, providing comments such as, \\"Everyone is interested in marriage around here\\". Or, \\"Marriage is such a huge thing. It's ingrained in every aspect of BYU. ... You come to BYU to get married\\". This mentality is common on BYU's campus, causing many stereotypes and countless jokes. =University encouragement= As a university, BYU is extremely supportive of marriage. For example, The Daily Universe‚Äîthe student run newspaper at BYU‚Äîpublishes a Bridal Guide each summer., BYU Bridal Guide. Even the course selection at BYU reflects an emphasis on marriage. While many universities offer one or two marriage and family classes to their students, BYU offers courses focused on mate selection, marriage preparation, marriage enhancement, marriage therapy, and multiple classes aimed at strengthening the family., BYU Course Catalog. On a higher level, the weekly university devotionals and quarterly Church Educational System Firesides (often held at BYU‚Äôs Marriott Center) often center on the topics of dating and marriage. Members of church leadership such as apostle Richard G. Scott urge young men to \\"not waste time in idle pursuits, but [to] serve a mission for the Church, then make marriage their highest priority\\"., Scott, Richard G. \\"To Have Peace and Happiness.\\" Church Educational System Fireside. 12 Sep. 2010. Address. Overall, students at Brigham Young University are urged often by church leaders and school leaders to wed. =Honor Code influence= On many college campuses, sexual encounters are common. For instance, in Norval Glenn and Elizabeth Marquardt's study \\"Hooking Up, Hanging Out, and Hoping for Mr. Right,\\" of 1,000 college women surveyed, 90% reported \\"hooking up\\"‚Äînon- committal sexual encounters‚Äîto be a regular occurrence on their respective campuses. Even more, 40% of these women have participated personally in a \\"hook up\\". However, at BYU, only about 4% of the student population reported sexual activity within dating and less than 1% of the student population reported sexual activity outside of dating (aka \\"hooking up\\"), according to \\"A Survey of Dating and Marriage at BYU\\". This abstinence from sexual activity is caused by both personal religious values and BYU's Honor Code, a contract each student signs prohibiting activities ranging from mixed gender camping trips to sexual intercourse. Students breaking these rules may face expulsion from the university., BYU Honor Code While at other universities, a \\"hook up\\" is typically defined by sexual activity, around 2% of the student population at BYU reported passionate kissing done outside of dating. This tamer form of \\"hooking up\\" has generally become known among the BYU student community as a NCMO (), or \\"noncommittal make out\\". =Church influence= The LDS church places strong emphasis on marriage in its teachings. In fact, celestial marriage is considered an ordinance necessary to exaltation. Members of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints firmly believe that their mission on earth is to marry and have a family. As a whole, Latter-day Saints are known to marry young. Compared to Protestants, Catholics, Methodists, and Jews, members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are the youngest to wed., Xu, Xiaohe, et al. \\"The Timing of First Marriage: Are There Religious Variations?\\" Journal of Family Issues 26.5 (2005): 585‚Äì613. Web. 21 Sep. 2010. Most likely, Latter-day Saints marry young because of the importance the LDS church places on marriage and family. The belief that \\"the family is central to the Creator‚Äôs plan for the eternal destiny of His children\\" furthers the LDS belief in the importance of marriage., The Family: A Proclamation to the World Crime and drug levels Brigham Young University's Honor Code, which all BYU students agree to as a condition of studying at BYU, prohibits the consumption of alcoholic beverages, tobacco, etc. As mentioned earlier, The Princeton Review has rated BYU the \\"#1 stone cold sober school\\" in the nation for several years running, an honor which the late LDS Church president Gordon B. Hinckley commented on with pride. The school's strait-laced reputation is a major selling point in athletic recruiting. As non-LDS players have become ever more important to the school's teams, BYU's wholesomeness is often attractive for prospective students who prefer an academic or social environment without alcohol, illegal drug abuse, and violent crime. According to the Uniform Crime Reports, incidents of crime in Provo are lower than the national average. Murder is rare, and robberies are about 1/10 the national average. Gordon B. Hinckley Alumni & Visitors Center Controversy In the 1970s, several schools protested against BYU, claiming it was a racist organization; Stanford and San Jos√© State both refused to play the university in sports. In 1970, the University of Arizona sent a \\"fact-finding committee\\" to determine if BYU was racist, finding that \\"rhetoric had escalated too far\\" with regards to racism and the Western Athletic Conference. The BYU newspaper The Daily Universe reported that Arizona's committee determined that BYU was not racist, but was an \\"isolated institution whose members simply do not relate to or understand black people.\\" BYU football players were met by 75 picketers demonstrating against racism at BYU when they played Arizona a week after the report.BYU NewsNet - Racial issues heat up; BYU accused of racism, blacks get priesthood in '70s In April 1992 during Take Back the Night, an on-campus women's rights group marched in protest at the University's lack of a Women's Resource Center. They feared that by not having such a center BYU was not giving enough aid to female students who were the victims of rape and abuse. By December 1992, a center had been approved. Then-BYU President Rex E. Lee said that the decision of the Board of Directors to approve the building of the center was unanimous.Excerpts - The Lord's University: Freedom and Authority at BYU Women's Services - Home In February 2012, a YouTube video called \\"What do you know about black history?\\" of students at BYU surfaced, exemplifying some students' knowledge about Black History Month and African Americans in general. The interviewer himself does Blackface while asking students a variety of questions.

Juan Luis Undurraga Aninat, one of the founders, acquired the shares of other investors allowing him to control more than 40 percent of the company.

Under the control of the New Zealand Dairy Board, Soprole bought out some of its competitors like L√°cteos Pirque in 1994 and Dos √Ålamos in 1997. Today, 76 percent of the Chilean dairy market is controlled by four companies: Nestl√©, Soprole, Loncoleche and Col√∫n.

Tin√ßurin was born to a peasant family, in the village of Tarakanovo (now Akkul in Penza Oblast). After getting work as a dishwasher in his teens, he studied at the famous Tatar madrasah, M√∂x√§mm√§di√§. However feeling dissatisfied with the education process there, he left with 82 other pupils in February, 1906. After visiting several Russian provinces, working as an itinerant teacher in rural schools, in 1910 joined his first professional troupe S√§yy√§r, becoming not just an actor, but also a playwright and one of the leading directors. In 1912 he wrote the play Honest Labour and in 1913 he wrote Fatal Step. Karim was an innovative playwright, studying the complex and contradictory phenomenon of forming personality, and so dealing with the construction of the dramatic conflict in a novel way. In 1918 Tin√ßurin was based in Moscow and was appointed chief of the Cultural Department of the Central Muslim Military Collegium, the military wing of Muskom. However, by November 1922, he had founded the Tatar Academic Theatre in Kazan. Here he worked with a number of prominent actors: B.Tarkhanov, K.Shamil, G.Bolgarskaya and others. Tin√ßurin wrote more than 30 plays during his short creative life: *Kazan Guys *Motherland *Blue Shawl *Honest Labour (1912) *Fatal Step (1913) *Yusuf and Zuleyha (1918) *The Parrot (1918) *The American (1925) *Without Sails (1926) *On the Kandra River (1932) *There Were Three of Them (1932) A victim of political repression during Stalinism, Tin√ßurin was rehabilitated posthumously.

On 3 April 2008, when C/2007 W1 was 0.66AU from the Earth and 1.7AU from the Sun, the coma (expanding tenuous dust atmosphere) of the comet was estimated to be as large as 10 arcminutes.

The comet came to perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) on 24 June 2008 at a distance of 0.8497 AU. The comet has an observation arc of 285 days allowing a good estimate of the orbit. The orbit of a long-period comet is properly obtained when the osculating orbit is computed at an epoch after leaving the planetary region and is calculated with respect to the center of mass of the solar system. Using JPL Horizons, the barycentric orbital elements for epoch 2020-Jan-01 generate a semi-major axis of 1,582 AU, an apoapsis distance of 3,163 AU, and a period of approximately 63,000 years. Before entering the planetary region, C/2007 W1 had a hyperbolic trajectory.

It was designed by architect E. W. Pugin (1834‚Äì1875), and built in 1866 as a private chapel for the Anderton family. Set within the grounds of Euxton Hall, and a Grade II listed building within its own right, the small Gothic chapel has been described as an architectural gem. Both English Heritage and the Ancient Monuments Society acknowledge that it is one of the important works of this architect. The Victorian Society has also recognised the building's national importance. Stained glass window in Euxton Hall Chapel by Hardman & Co. Of particular interest is the large stained glass window manufactured by Hardman & Co., set in the west wall and dated 14 October 1866. It incorporates the coat of arms of the Anderton family, which is repeated in the encaustic floor tiles of the centre aisle. Herbert Minton, the first manufacturer to produce these tiles in 1830, worked closely with Pugin in their design and manufacture for numerous buildings, notably the Palace of Westminster. In 1866, the architectural period of the Gothic Revival was at its peak, and Euxton Hall Chapel, having been designed by Pugin, was arguably one of the finest Victorian chapels to be found in England. The exterior of the Chapel is almost entirely Pugin. The South front has three pairs of lancet window, a typical medieval feature, with each arch having a pair of intricate detailed carvings. The shaped slate tiles on the roof of the Chapel form geometric patterning, a feature also associated with the work of Pugin. In 2004 the chapel was majorly restored by conservationist Andrew Gray and converted by him to a private residence .

He was possibly an inspiration for the character of Indiana Jones. McGovern's life may be more incredible than the fictional character he spawned. By age 30, he had already explored the Amazon and braved uncharted regions of the Himalayas, survived revolution in Mexico, studied at Oxford and the Sorbonne and become a Buddhist priest in a Japanese monastery. He became a beloved lecturer, war correspondent and military strategist. Biography Early life McGovern was born in Manhattan, New York, on September 28, 1897, the son of Janet Blair (n√©e Montgomery) and Felix Daniel McGovern, an army officer. Time reported that he began to travel at the age of six weeks, once visiting Mexico with his mother \\"just to see a revolution.\\" His formative years were spent in Asia. McGovern graduated with the degree of soro, or Doctor of Divinity, from the Buddhist monastery of Nishi Honganji in Kyoto, Japan at age 20 before going on to study at the Sorbonne and University of Berlin. He received his D.Phil. from Christ Church, Oxford in 1922‚Äîworking his way through school by teaching Chinese at SOAS, University of London.WILLIAM MONTGOMERY McGOVERN (1897-1964) PAPERS, 1919-1967 Exploration Shortly after graduation he began his first great expedition, to the remote mountain kingdom of Tibet. In his book To Lhasa in Disguise, McGovern claims he had to sneak into the country disguised as a local porter. As Time reported in 1938: > With a few Tibetan servants, he climbed through the wild, snowy passes of > the Himalayas. There, in the bitter cold, he stood naked while a companion > covered his body with brown stain, squirted lemon juice into his blue eyes > to darken them. Thus disguised as a coolie, he arrived in the Forbidden City > without being detected, but disclosed himself to the civilian officials. A > fanatical mob led by Buddhist monks stoned his house. Bill McGovern slipped > out through a back door and joined the mob in throwing stones. The civil > government took him into protective custody, finally sent him back to India > with an escort. Another expedition to Peru and the Amazon would follow a few years later, resulting in another book, Jungle Paths and Inca Ruins. Wartime activities =Second Sino-Japanese War= In 1937, McGovern was named Far East correspondent by the Chicago Times, arriving in Tokyo with Thomas C. Quackenboss, a family friend and former student of McGovern's at Northwestern, as war began with China. Both men set off for Manchukuo to cover the invasion, only to see Thomas C. Quackenboss thrown into jail for taking photos in the streets. They went on to spend long stints on the front. =World War II= When the United States joined what had become World War II, McGovern joined the United States Naval Reserve, serving from 1941 to 1945. At Guadalcanal, he operated behind enemy lines, using his knowledge of Japanese to taunt enemy soldiers and interrogate captives. In the closing days of the war he served in the European Theatre, crossing the Rhine with General Patton. His most important job was not martial in nature however. Throughout the war he would rise at 5:30 AM to prepare a top-secret newspaper on enemy capabilities and intentions. This paper was considered required breakfast reading for President Roosevelt and the Joint Chiefs. Academic career At age 30, McGovern became assistant curator of the anthropology department at Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History. Two years later, was appointed a professor of Political Science at Northwestern University, a position he would hold for the rest of his life. As Professor of Far Eastern Studies his classes were perpetually oversubscribed, given his eminence and popularity. His lectures were never dull and frequently peppered with anecdotes from his time in the far east, particularly in Tibet and Japan. He insisted that his pupils learn at least one or two kanji characters a week as he carefully illustrated them on a large chalkboard at the front of the lecture hall and explained their meanings as he drew them. His students considered themselves fortunate to have landed a spot in one of his classes. His son, William M. McGovern jr., followed him into academia teaching law at Northwestern University School of Law in the early 1960s. Between his time as a war correspondent during the Sino-Japanese War and the entry of the United States into World War II, McGovern lectured on government at Harvard University. In 1941, he published a well publicized history of fascist political ideologies. During the post-War years, McGovern lectured on military intelligence and strategy at the Naval, Air and Army War Colleges. Reputed to speak 12 languages and deaf in one ear, McGovern was an academic celebrity known for outlandish foreign dress and holding court in Northwestern's University Club. Death McGovern died after a long illness in Evanston at age 67 on December 12, 1964. Descendants McGovern married his second cousin, Margaret Montgomery, and with her had four children‚Äîthree daughters and a son. His granddaughter is actress Elizabeth McGovern. His grandson is University of Washington mathematics professor William Monty McGovern. Works  * * MacGovern's work on central Asian history was heavily criticized by the journal American Anthropologist, in particular on his interpretations of Chinese classical sources : \\"Dr McGovern has converted this dry and perplexing source material into a racy and jocular chronicle where fact and fancy are so thoroughly mixed that a general reader could not possibly differentiate them. Furthermore, there are numerous generalizations and speculations not justified by the sources.\\". His work From Luther to Hitler was also criticized in the journal American Political Science Review on some key omissions and well as weaknesses in presentation of arguments : \\"Failure to distinguish clearly between basic assumptions and the doctrines deduced from them enables to suggest a degree of continuity which dissolves upon closer examination.\\".

The Villa del Trebbio is a Medici villa in Tuscany, Italy. The villa is located near San Piero a Sieve in the Mugello region, in the province of Florence, in the area from which the Medici family originated. It was one of the first - if not the first - of the Medici villas built outside Florence.Ballerini, p.68. The estate is situated on a strategic position in the Apennines, on the top of a hill dominating the Val di Sieve, near a crossroads (giving rise to its name, from the Latin trivium). The villa belonged to Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici, the founder of the Medici bank and of the fortunes of the Medici family. Following his death in 1429, it was remodelled by his son, Cosimo de' Medici, whose architect, Michelozzo, restyled it as a fortified castle. Michelozzo retained the windowless tower, moat and drawbridge, and added a perimeter walkway with corbels. There is a central courtyard with a well. The villa remained essentially a fortified house, but various features indicate its secondary purpose as a place of pleasure, including an early walled garden, built on two terraces beside the villa. The upper terrace has a stone pergola, with a double row of columns; a similar pergola has disappeared from the lower terrace. The garden was a place of retreat for Cosimo, away from the troubles of politics in Florence, where he could tend his fruit trees. On the other side of the villa stands a chapel. The villa was surrounded by woods and an agricultural estate, bordering that of the Villa Medicea di Cafaggiolo. In the sixteenth century the villa was enlarged by Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, who enjoyed hunting in the estate, and his son Ferdinand I. Ferdinand II sold the estate to a wealthy Florentine, Giuliano Serragli, in 1644, who gave it to the Oratorians. The garden to the front of the villa, with roses and box hedges, was laid out in the twentieth century. As of 2008, it belongs to a private individual who uses the property to produce fine wines. Wine tasting and tours are available to interested groups in English and Italian.

The fortress of Castra Martis  History  Castra Martis, named after the Roman god of war Mars, on the modern site of Kula (Latin/Italian Cula), in Vidin Province in northwestern Bulgaria, served to protect the road through Vrashka Chuka pass in the western Balkan mountains. It was important enough in the Roman province of Dacia ripensis to become a suffragan of the provincial capital's Metropolitan Archdiocese of Ratiaria, in the sway of the Patriarchate of Constantinople. Its only recorded Suffragan Bishop was Calvus, participant at the Council of Serdica in 343 (called by the Pope, boycotted by most Eastern sees).

Biography Early Years A Los Angeles native, Ross attended Gardena High School, where he was student body president and president of the District-Wide Association of Student Councils for the Los Angeles Unified School District. He went on to graduate from Morehouse College with a degree in Political Science, and received his juris doctorate from Southwestern Law School. He is also a member of the African-American Greek fraternal organization Kappa Alpha Psi. Law and Politics An internship working for the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office at the height of the crack cocaine epidemic convinced Ross that victims and those living in underserved communities needed advocates to represent their interests. He decided to become a deputy district attorney, and later worked as a hardcore gang prosecutor responsible for implementing controversial civil gang nuisance injunctions. Ross entered politics in 1995, running for a seat on the Los Angeles City Council, finishing third despite endorsements from the Los Angeles Times and LA Weekly publications. He was subsequently appointed to the LA County Parks and Recreation Commission, and co-founded The New Leaders, an organization created to train and prepare the next generation of African- American leaders. Initial Media Employment Ross began contributing op-ed pieces for the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles Sentinel and Los Angeles Daily News. He was named co-host of \\"The People's Connection\\" on 103.9 KACE, before being given his own show on Disney's KTZN 710 The Zone. Ross later hosted and produced a weekend program on Talkradio 790 KABC until he retired to begin his judicial career. Election to the California Bench and Subsequent Removal While attending law school, Ross clerked for David W. Williams. A fellow black Republican, Judge Williams would administer the oath of office to Ross after he became a judge on the then Inglewood Municipal Court. At that time, Ross was the youngest elected judge in the state of California. Ross was elevated the following year to the Superior Court after a ballot measure approved by California voters. During his seven years on the bench, Ross handled over 60,000 cases, ranging from traffic and small claims matters, to sexually violent predators and murderers. After being profiled on KCET's Life & Times Tonight, Ross began appearing on the PBS program to discuss legal issues from a judge's perspective. He also frequently spoke about the importance of blacks becoming police officers, prosecutors, defense attorneys and judges to ensure the judicial system treated minorities fairly. In 2005 the Commission on Judicial Performance (CJP) removed Judge Ross from office, stating he violated judicial canons pertaining to defendants' constitutional rights, public comments made on KCET, and his involvement in a television court show pilot.Inquiry concerning Kevin A. Ross . California Commission on Judicial Performance. November 16, 2005. Ross unsuccessfully appealed the CJP's decision to the California Supreme Court, a ruling that also made him ineligible to practice law in the state.State Bar Membership Records Neither the initial Endemol- and Tribune Entertainment-produced \\"Mobile Court\\", nor the follow-up Twentieth Television program \\"Ross is Boss\\", was picked up by television stations for syndication. Return to Media Reigniting his interest in media, Ross decided to start a communications company, become a blogger, and launch an eponymous Internet show on Blogtalkradio, a large citizen broadcasting network. \\"The Kevin Ross Show\\" became a leading current events and conservative political show on Blogtalkradio. It also ranked among the top five most popular shows on the social networking radio site. In 2008, Fox News Radio and BlogTalkRadio partnered to bring listeners \\"Election 2008: Battle of the Blog Talkers.\\" Fans of FOX News Radio's \\"FOX Across America\\" selected their favorite BlogTalkRadio hosts from each side of the political spectrum during a weeklong, one-on-one tournament. Ross was chosen as one of the eight hosts, and ultimately won the contest representing the political right. At a 2009 business meeting with comedian Byron Allen to discuss an online media venture, Allen was so impressed with Ross that he made him a deal right on the spot to host a court show for Entertainment Studios (ES). The following year, \\"America's Court with Judge Ross\\" was among the 2010-2011 crop of freshman programs in daytime. Currently in its tenth season, America's Court can also be seen with other ES court programs on the company's legal cable network Justice Central. Entrepreneurship Along with serving as one of the executive producers on the Emmy nominated America's Court, Ross also appears on various cable and radio outlets such as Fox News, MSNBC, CNN, Black Entertainment Television (BET), NPR, The Tom Joyner Morning Show and KJLH 102.3 FM as a legal, political and social commentator.

Early life A Massachusetts native, Weeks was born in the town of Tisbury, on Martha's Vineyard, to Captain Hiram Weeks and Margaret D. Cottle, a relative of New York Senator Thomas C. Platt. After accompanying his father on a voyage to South America, Weeks studied medicine for three years at the College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City. However, his love for the sea compelled him to become a sailor and later a partner in a boat operating firm. During the American Civil War, he volunteered for the Union Navy in the Battle of New Orleans. He then headed the Union Army's 2nd Florida Cavalry with the rank of major. After the war, he settled in Tallahassee, Florida. Lieutenant governorship Weeks was appointed to the office of Lieutenant Governor of Florida by Governor Harrison Reed on January 24, 1870, to fill the vacancy left after the dismissal of William H. Gleason. He took the oath of office that same day. However, his appointment was controversial. State Comptroller Robert H. Gamble, claiming that the Governor could not make an appointment to an elected position, refused to pay Weeks his salary until Weeks took the case to the Florida Supreme Court. On his first day presiding over the Senate, a majority of the senators walked out on the session. At the next day's meeting, another senator occupied his seat. After a motion was proposed to arrest him, he left early. As Weeks's term was intended to be temporary, Governor Reed called for an election to be held on November 8. Samuel T. Day was elected Lieutenant Governor, and when the legislature met on January 3, 1871, Day took office as prescribed by the state constitution.Florida Constitution of 1868, Article XVI, Section 21. On January 12,Cyclop√¶dia, vol. 10, p. 303. Weeks again appealed to the Supreme Court, accusing Day of \\"usurping\\" his office, which he believed should last for two additional years, the remainder of his predecessor's term. However, the court ruled that Governor Reed had the power to call the election and that Weeks's appointment had expired on December 27, 1870, when the election results were certified.Cocke, 19. Later life Weeks later represented Leon County in the Florida Legislature, in the Florida House of Representatives.'Members of the Florida House of Representatives by County, 1845-2012, Florida House of Representatives: 2011, pg. 162 and served as the Leon County sheriff. A Republican, he ran unsuccessfully for the House of Representatives against incumbent Robert H. M. Davidson in 1878.

It is also used in non-criminal violations of law, such as certain classes of traffic offenses. For example, the common law crime of larceny requires the taking and carrying away of tangible property from another person, with the intent of permanently depriving the owner of that property. Robbery, under the common law, requires all of the same elements and also the use of force or intimidation to accomplish the taking. Therefore, larceny is a lesser included offense in the offense of robbery, as every robbery includes a larcenous act as part of the crime. Assault is also a lesser included offense of robbery, just as false imprisonment is usually a lesser included offense of kidnapping. However, an offense will not be a lesser included offense if it carries a maximum penalty greater than that carried by the charged offense. In the case of traffic offenses, serious misconduct while operating a motor vehicle can result in a charge of reckless driving, which can be punishable (as a misdemeanor) by imprisonment, a fine, or both. However, if the person charged proves to the court that the actions were not serious enough to constitute recklessness, the offense may qualify as being the lesser-included offense of improper driving, which is not a criminal offense and is punishable by only a fine. In others the charge may be substituted with one of driving without due care and attention or similar, which may be accepted in a plea bargain or may likewise be found by the court. Merger doctrine Under the merger doctrine as this term is used in criminal law, lesser included offenses generally merge into the greater offense. Therefore, a person who commits a robbery cannot be convicted of both the robbery and the larceny that was part of it. In Canadian law, the leading case on this principle is R. v. Kienapple and the principle is therefore commonly called the Kienapple principle. Solicitation to commit a crime and attempt to commit a crime, although not strictly speaking lesser included offenses, merge into the completed crime. As an important exception, the crime of conspiracy does not merge into the completed crime. Use in jury proceedings In criminal jury trials, the court is permitted (but not required) to instruct jurors that they can find the defendant guilty of the most serious crime charged, or of a lesser included offense of that crime (in English law, this is termed an alternative verdict). In murder cases, however, where a convicted defendant may face capital punishment, the United States Supreme Court has held that the court must instruct the jury that they may find the defendant guilty of a lesser included offense such as voluntary manslaughter.Beck v. Alabama, 447 U.S. 625 (1980), overturning an Alabama law prohibiting lesser included offense instructions in capital cases. The reasoning for this ruling is that when the jury is not given the ability to convict for a lesser offense, the jurors might opt to convict a less culpable defendant instead of letting defendant go free, essentially convicting of a more serious crime than the facts warrant. As the Court noted, \\"the failure to give the jury the 'third option' of convicting on a lesser included offense would seem inevitably to enhance the risk of an unwarranted conviction. Such a risk cannot be tolerated in a case in which the defendant's life is at stake.\\" Therefore, they must have at least one option that falls in between these extremes.

The merger doctrine traditionally applies only to covenants of title; covenants relating to the physical condition of the property (say, a promise that the furnace is in good working order) will not merge, and will not extinguish. The parties may by contract abrogate the doctrine and provide that some or all terms of the contract survive the closing and delivery of the deed. Merger also refers to the doctrine whereby \\"a fee simple estate, once fragmented into present and future interests, can thereafter be reconstituted. 'Merger is the absorption of a lesser estate by a greater estate, and takes place when two distinct estates of greater and lesser rank meet in the same person or class of persons at the same time without any intermediate estate.' \\" Similarly, a merger doctrine extinguishes an easement by necessity to a landlocked piece of property once that property is sold to one of the adjoining owners, thus extinguishing the necessity. The lack of any property interest removes the necessity and the easement.

On the basis of Nansen‚Äôs account of his journey Jackson seriously considered making a bid for the Pole himself, and began to build replicas of Nansen‚Äôs sledges and kayaks.

It happened to coincide with the period when it reached the zenith of its economic, military and political Golden Age. The term has acquired a negative connotation in 19th-century Orangist Dutch historiography, but whether such a negative view is justified is debatable. Republicans argue that the Dutch state functioned very well under the regime of Grand Pensionary Johan de Witt, despite the fact that it was forced to fight two major wars with England, and several minor wars with other European powers. Thanks to friendly relations with France, a cessation of hostilities with Spain, and the relative weakness of other European great powers, the Republic for a while was able to play a pivotal role in the \\"European Concert\\" of nations, even imposing a pax nederlandica in the Scandinavian area. A convenient war with Portugal enabled the Dutch East India Company to take over the remnants of the Portuguese empire in Ceylon and South India. After the end of the war with Spain in 1648, and the attendant end of the Spanish embargo on trade with the Republic that had favored the English, Dutch commerce swept everything before it, in the Iberian Peninsula, the Mediterranean Sea and the Levant, as well as in the Baltic region. Dutch industry, especially textiles, was as yet not hindered by protectionism. As a consequence, the Republic's economy enjoyed its last great economic boom. Politically, the Staatsgezinde (Republican) faction of the ruling Dutch Regents such as Cornelis de Graeff and Andries Bicker reigned supreme, even thinking up an ideological justification of republicanism (the \\"True Freedom\\") that went against the contemporary European trend of monarchical absolutism, but prefigured \\"modern\\" political ideas that eventually found their fullest expression in the American and French constitutions of the 18th century. There was a \\"monarchical\\" opposing undertow, however, from the adherents of the House of Orange that wanted to restore the young Prince of Orange to the position of Stadtholder that his father, grandfather, great-uncle, and great-grandfather had held. The republicans attempted to rule this out by constitutional prohibitions, like the Act of Seclusion, but were eventually unsuccessful in the crisis of the Rampjaar (Year of Disaster) of 1672, that brought about the fall of the De Witt-regime. Prequel: The Stadtholderate of William II The office of Stadtholder of a province predated the Republic. In the Habsburg Netherlands the Stadtholders were the representatives of the Sovereign (lately Philip II of Spain in his capacity of duke or count), who performed important constitutional functions, like appointing city magistrates (usually from double lists, drawn up by the vroedschap), and in times of war acting as provincial commander-in-chief.Israel (1995), p. 703 William the Silent had been such a stadtholder in Holland and Zeeland under the Habsburg regime, until he was removed from office in 1567. After the Dutch Revolt broke out, he simply reassumed that office in 1572 with the connivance of the rebel States of Holland, but still pretended to act in the name of the king. When the rebel provinces formed their defensive Union of Utrecht, whose treaty was to become the \\"constitution\\" of the Republic, they built upon the Habsburg constitutional framework, including the office of stadtholder. Even when independence from the King of Spain was declared with the Act of Abjuration there was no reason to change anything: the act simply declared that henceforth the magistrates, amongst whom the stadtholders, would hold their commissions from the from now on sovereign provincial states (there was no stadtholder on the federal level). Willem II, prince of Orange, and his wife Maria Stuart (by Gerard van Honthorst, 1652) Still, when after the death of William in 1584, and subsequently the end of the search for a new sovereign after the departure of Leicester the States General reluctantly accepted that they had to be sovereign in 1588, the office took on a vestigial character. Had it not been that the stadtholder of Holland was usually also elected to the confederal office of Captain general of the Union, which was an important office in time of war, one would have expected that the office might have been left vacant much earlier than eventually happened. However, in the circumstances of the ongoing war with Spain, the Captain-general was indispensable. And the office of stadtholder remained an important power-base, enabling its holder to exert an influence far beyond its formal powers. Prince Maurice demonstrated this in the constitutional crisis of 1618, when the States of Holland under Johan van Oldenbarnevelt, asserting supreme provincial sovereignty, tried to hire provincial troops rather than federal troops under Maurice's command. Maurice stopped this with a coup d'√©tat and subsequently asserted (with the assent of the other provinces) a federal sovereignty that superseded the provincial one. He also purged the Holland regents that supported the provincial-sovereignty pretensions of Oldenbarnevelt and so managed to acquire a political dominance in the government of the Republic that assumed almost monarchical proportions. His brother, and successor as stadtholder, Frederick Henry held on to this ascendancy, due to a deft policy of divide-and conquer, playing off the regent factions against each other. When Frederick Henry died in March, 1647, his son William II was appointed stadtholder in Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, Overijssel, and Gelderland (the office was only to become hereditary in 1747). But he did not have the stature of his father, also because Frederick Henry did not think highly of his capabilities and had refused to allow him to lead troops in the field during the war against Spain that was then in its last stages.Israel (1995), p. 595 William was opposed to the peace with Spain, but he was largely ignored by the politicians in the States General, especially the representatives of the city of Amsterdam. The Peace of M√ºnster was duly concluded in 1648, in spite of the opposition of the province of Zeeland and William, the latter deliberately absenting himself from the discussions to masque his impotence.Israel (1995), p. 597 In the years directly following the peace a number of conflicts erupted between the stadtholder and especially the States of Holland about policy. William (though a lax Calvinist himself, like his father) keenly supported the Calvinist die-hards in their attempts to force the Protestant religion on the Catholic inhabitants of the recently acquired Generality Lands (though his father had been far more tolerant of Catholic freedom of conscience). William managed to gain much popularity by this hard-line policy among the more orthodox lower classes in the Republic-proper, but especially the Holland regents thwarted the policy, because they were aware of the needless resentment it caused.Israel (1995), pp. 598‚Äì602 This was, however, just political posturing on William's part, cynically exploiting certain prejudices in an attempt to gain ascendancy over the regents. More important as a matter of principle was the conflict over the reduction of the standing army that arose during 1649 and 1650. The regents understandably did not quite see the need for an expensive, large, mercenary standing army in peacetime. Holland demanded a reduction of the army to 26,000 (from a level of 35,000 in 1648), whereas William argued that the personnel needs were now appreciably larger, because the territory to be protected by garrisoned fortresses was now a great deal larger. Though the parties came close to an agreement on a total of about 29,000 men, the final difference of a few hundred men proved to be insurmountable.Israel (1995), pp. 602‚Äì603 The policy conflict had become a test of wills. And it soon grew into a constitutional conflict, reminiscent of the crisis of 1618. The majority in the States of Holland now revived the old constitutional theory of Oldenbarnevelt and Hugo Grotius, stating that the provinces' sovereignty, and not that of the federal state, was supreme, and that Holland was entitled to disband troops that were paid out of its contribution to the federal war budget, without the consent of the other provinces. The implication of this was, of course, that the dissolution of the Union was a possibility, with a probability of civil war.Israel (1995), P. 603 Like his uncle Maurice, William now felt he needed to save the Union, if need be by force. In collusion with his colleague-stadtholder of Friesland and Groningen, Willem Frederik of Nassau-Dietz (a cousin in the cadet branch of the House of Orange-Nassau), he embarked on a campaign of intimidation of the Holland regents that would ultimately lead to the use of force. On July 30, 1650, William had six leading Holland regents arrested in The Hague (where the States General met), while Willem Frederik attempted to take the city of Amsterdam by surprise with federal troops. Though this coup de main failed and Amsterdam managed to keep the troops outside the gates, the city was sufficiently intimidated to give in to William's demands to purge his opponents from the Amsterdam city council. The States of Holland then capitulated and rescinded its order to disband the troops. The theory of provincial supremacy was disavowed also.Israel (1995), pp. 604‚Äì607; Cornelis Musch the griffier of the States-General, played an important advisory role in the coup d'√©tat and he also drew up a report about the events, which caused a scandal when his father-in-law Jacob Cats inadvertently delivered it to the States of Holland after the fall of the Stadtholderate in the next year However, William was stricken with smallpox in his hour of triumph. He died suddenly in November 1650. His wife Mary Stuart was pregnant and gave birth to his only legitimate son William III a week after his death. The office of stadtholder had become vacant in five of the provinces.Israel (1995), p. 609 The Republican regime and Johan de Witt If the Republic had been a Monarchy, or if the office of stadtholder had already been hereditary (as it was to become after the Orangist amendments of 1747) the posthumous child would no doubt have been acclaimed stadtholder automatically, and a Regency would have been put into place, as happened in 1751, when three-year-old William V succeeded his deceased father in office in all seven provinces. As a matter of fact, this was proposed by the Orangist faction in the Republic, and especially by Willem Frederik, who proposed himself in the role of Lieutenant- Stadtholder in the five provinces in which he was not already stadtholder in his own right, until baby William would come of age. But this proposal elicited little enthusiasm from the Holland regents, who still vividly remembered his role in the recent coup.Israel (1995), p. 705 On the other hand, if the office of stadtholder was indispensable, the States of the five provinces with a vacancy could and would have appointed a successor, though not necessarily someone from the Nassau families. As a matter of fact, there were the precedents of Willem IV van den Bergh and Adolf van Nieuwenaar in Gelderland in early Republican times. But the Holland regents did not feel a pressing need to appoint anyone, especially in view of recent events. They acted very quickly to undo the effects of William's coup, freeing the captive regents and reinstating them in their offices. The Gecommitteerde Raden (executive committee) of the States of Holland moved immediately to reassert their authority over the army and convened a plenary session of the States. Next Holland proposed in the States General that a so-called Great Assembly (a kind of constitutional convention) should be convened at short notice, to amend the Union of Utrecht.Israel (1995), pp. 702‚Äì703 The States of Holland did not await this Assembly, however, but for their own province immediately started to make constitutional alterations. On December 8, 1650, the States formally took over their Stadtholders' powers. The eighteen voting towns in the States were given the option to apply for a charter that enabled them to henceforth elect their own vroedschap members and magistrates, under ultimate supervision of the States, but otherwise without the usual drawing up of double lists, for outsiders to choose from. This did not apply to the non- voting towns, however, that still had to present double lists, but now to the States, instead of the Stadtholder. The States also assumed the power to appoint magistrates in the unincorporated countryside, like drosten and baljuws.Israel (1995), pp. 703‚Äì704 Great Assembly of 1651 by Dirck van Delen This did imply a significant change in the power structure in the province. The position of the city regents was improved, while the ridderschap (the oligarchical representative body of the nobility in the States, that had one vote, equal to one city) lost influence, especially in the countryside. The change also diminished the power of the representative bodies of the guilds in the cities, that had often acted as a check on the power of the vroedschap with the help of the stadtholder. The change therefore did not go unopposed, and caused some rioting by the groups being disenfranchised.Israel (1995), p. 704 Holland meanwhile encouraged other provinces to follow its example. In Zeeland a majority of the States voted to also leave the office of stadtholder vacant, and assume its powers. For good measure, the vote of the First Noble in the States of Zeeland (which was usually exercised by the Prince of Orange as Marquess of Veere and Flushing) was abolished, and the request of the Zeeland ridderschap to sit in his place was denied. In other provinces, the results were mixed. Holland sent a delegation to Gelderland (where the divided States voted to postpone a decision). Willem Frederik, meanwhile, with the help of the States of Friesland, Groningen, and Drenthe (where he was stadtholder) exhorted the States of Overijssel and Utrecht to appoint baby William (with him as lieutenant), but to no avail. These provinces decided to await the Great Assembly.Israel, pp. 704‚Äì706 The Great Assembly that was held between January and August, 1651, addressed a number of important issues. The first one was that of the stadholderate. Friesland and Groningen led the opposition to Holland, arguing that the Union of Utrecht required the appointment of provincial stadtholders by implication, as the articles 9 and 21 of the treaty stipulated mediation by stadtholders in case of conflicts between provinces. In their interpretation the office of stadtholder thereby acquired a federal aspect. But the other provinces were not convinced. They decided to leave the office vacant indefinitely. It should be noted, however, that the office was not abolished, not even in Holland and Zeeland.Israel (1995), p. 707 A second important topic was the reorganization of the command structure of army and navy. The office of captain general and admiral general was a federal office. In the absence of the usual occupant of that office, the stadtholder of Holland, the question was who would now fill it. A possibility would have been to appoint Willem Frederik, who was after all a stadtholder, but in view of his role in the coup of the previous year, he did not have the confidence of Holland. It was therefore decided to leave this office also vacant, and to divide its functions between the States General and the Raad van State jointly (as far as appointments and promotions of officers was concerned) and the Holland nobleman Jan Wolfert van Brederode as commander-in- chief of the army with the rank of Field Marshal. The latter was only a temporary solution, however, as Brederode soon after died, which caused another round of intrigues to keep Willem Frederik from the top job in the army.Israel (1995), pp. 709‚Äì710, 731‚Äì733 As the function of admiral general had usually been only symbolic, the actual command of the fleets having been left in the hands of the lieutenant-admirals of the five Admiralties, this office did not pose a similar political problem. The Great Assembly also addressed the problem of the Public Church in the country, but left the results of the Synod of Dort in place. It rejected the requests of the provinces of Brabant and Drenthe for representation on the States General.Israel (1995), pp. 707‚Äì709, 710‚Äì711 Seemingly, the results of the attempt at constitutional reform were meagre therefore. But appearances were not what they seemed. There had been a sea change in the political balance within the union by the elimination of the person who held five stadtholderships in his hand. The position of Holland became unassailable, on the one hand, because the other provinces were internally divided, and because there was not one leader (like the stadtholder had been) to lead them in opposition to Holland. left On the other hand, there was the fortuitous factor that soon in the province of Holland the office of Raadpensionaris which is usually translated as Grand Pensionary, if it concerns the raadpensionaris of the States of Holland; cities often had raadpensionarissen, too was taken over by the young regent from Dordrecht, Johan de Witt. After the execution of the capable Oldenbarnevelt, this office had usually been filled by men of questionable competency, who in any case were compliant to the will of the Stadtholder, like Jacob Cats. First Adriaan Pauw and Andries Bicker and then De Witt and his uncles Cornelis de Graeff and Andries de Graeff were highly capable men, however, who took an active leading role, not only in the States of Holland, but also as leader of the delegation of Holland in the States General. Holland's potential as leader of the Union was therefore fully employed when De Witt gave direction to its policies. In other words, though formally only the \\"salaried official\\" (which is what pensionaris means) of one of the provinces, De Witt fulfilled in practice the leading role that previously had been fulfilled by the successive stadtholders of Holland. The stadtholder was truly not missed. But this was not the only thing that changed. The constitutional conflict about the supremacy of the sovereignty of the Generality over provincial sovereignty, that seemed to be settled by the coup of William II, became \\"unsettled\\" again after his death. De Witt of course met opposition from other provinces from time to time, and sometimes Holland was even outvoted in the States General. This posed an unenviable dilemma for De Witt. Although decisions were supposed to be unanimous in the States General, this would in practice be unworkable. The principle of majority voting was therefore accepted by all provinces. On the other hand, Holland could not allow the other provinces to go against its wishes, as the major contributor to the Generality's budget. De Witt was therefore only prepared to accept a majority decision if Holland was in the majority. But how to justify this? The solution was to push the old doctrine of the supremacy of provincial sovereignty (as long as it was Holland's sovereignty), first formulated by Fran√ßois Vranck in 1587. And this became the basic constitutional theory of the Republic during the Stadtholderless Era, at least of De Witt'sStates Party.Israel (1995), p. 719 Students of modern Dutch politics will recognize in this characterization of De Witt's statecraft the outlines of the venerable Dutch Polder Model. The First Anglo-Dutch War and the Act of Seclusion The Act of Seclusion De Witt's genius as a statesman came first to the fore during the First Anglo-Dutch War. Due to certain strategic disadvantages of the Dutch and to a neglect of the Dutch navy after the end of the Eighty Years' War, the war went badly for the Dutch, at least in the theatre of war closest to both countries (elsewhere, the Dutch managed to achieve a strategic victoryIsrael (1995), p. 721). The consequence was that Dutch economic interests were severely damaged; about 1200 ships were captured by the English; the herring fishery was paralyzed; Dutch Brazil was definitively lost to the Portuguese, because no reinforcements could be sent; a large part of the long-distance trade had to be suspended. Because of all this, the economy suffered a severe slump.Israel (1995), p. 716 The ruling regent class was blamed for these losses by its Orangist opponents, especially the Frisian Stadtholder William Frederick. A veritable deluge of anonymous pamphlets excoriated the regime, and many Calvinist preachers tried to foment public unrest against the regents. This intimidated the States Party in the province of Zeeland sufficiently, bringing it to the brink of submitting to the demand that the three-year-old Prince of Orange should be appointed stadtholder of Zeeland. Their backs had to be stiffened by a delegation of the States of Holland, in which De Witt (not yet Grand Pensionary) played a leading role. Other provinces were wavering also. But the danger the country was in also helped restrain the Orangists from doing their worst. For the moment, therefore, William Frederick did not achieve his objective.Israel (1995), pp. 719‚Äì720 The \\"republican system\\" of the States Party (faced with the pressure from the English without, and the Orangist Party within) was saved by the cohesion of Hollands regents (who now closed ranks), the dissension in the other provinces, and the vulnerability of the English to strategic attack anywhere outside the \\"Narrow Seas\\". As long as the Dutch were not definitively defeated, and were rebuilding their fleets, the English were forced to concentrate their own navy in home waters, so that they could not break the hold of the Dutch on sea-lanes farther away. As a consequence, English commerce was paralyzed to an even greater extent than Dutch commerce. Dutch ally Denmark closed the Sound to English shipping, aided by a Dutch blockade fleet, stopping all English trade with the Baltic. In the Mediterranean the English Levant fleet was trapped at Leghorn, and an English relief fleet was destroyed by admiral Johan van Galen in the Battle of Leghorn. In the East Indies the EIC was swept from the seas by the Dutch East India Company. Even in the North Sea Dutch privateers equaled the captures of their English colleagues. Battle of Leghorn, by Willem Hermansz van Diest The Commonwealth and its leader Oliver Cromwell were therefore ready to come to terms by November, 1653. While the war dragged on, and English economic losses mounted, the English dropped most of their demands. By the Spring of 1654 only the demand that the Republic should never again appoint a Prince of Orange (who also happened to be a grandson of Charles I of England) to high office, remained. This demand (which may very well have originated with the wily De Witt, though Cromwell later officially denied thisIsrael (1995), p. 725) caused an uproar under the Orangists in the Republic. This was an obstacle to the peace both parties by now heartily yearned for, as the other provinces would never ratify it. De Witt broke this impasse by officially taking this item off the table (though it was non-negotiable to the English, ratification by Parliament depending on it), but secretly agreeing to the Act of Seclusion as a secret annexe to the official treaty. The trick here was that this Act would only bind the province of Holland. The States General ratified the treaty without the secret annexe, not knowing of its existence, and Parliament awaited ratification of the Act by the States of Holland, before itself ratifying the entire treaty. Only the two plenipotentiaries of the province of Holland (Hieronymus van Beverningh and Willem Nieupoort) knew of the ruse. The Frisian representative was left in the dark. The main \\"victims\\" of De Witt's duplicity were therefore his colleagues in the Dutch government.Israel (1995), p. 722 To save the peace, De Witt first had to ram the Act through the States of Holland. Despite the opposition of a large minority of the voting cities he succeeded in getting the Act approved on May 4, 1654. Of course, this caused vehement argument among the Orangists in the province of Holland and elsewhere. Friesland in particular was outraged. The Delegated States of Friesland even went so far as to demand an inquiry by the States General into the conduct of the Dutch treaty negotiators. The other provinces were again too much internally divided, however, to offer a coherent opposition. Their paralysis prevented taking any action by the States General. Only Zeeland could have joined Friesland, but only uttered a verbal protest, because this province was well aware that an abrogation of the Act would mean an abrogation of the peace treaty, and Zeeland could not afford a resumption of the war.Israel (1995), pp. 723‚Äì725 The suspicion that De Witt was not unhappy with the Act was reinforced by the justification he had published (after having it adopted first by the States of Holland) in July 1654.Deductie, ofte Declaratie, uyt de Fondamenten der Regieringe, tot justificatie vande Acten van Seclusie, raeckende 't employ vanden Prince van Oraigne In it he repeated the constitutional claims of the provincial-sovereignty doctrine as a justification for blocking young William's ascent to high office. He held that the Union of Utrecht was just an alliance of seven sovereign states, leaving each of those states free to make its own constitutional and political arrangements. Each could refrain from appointing anyone to any of its offices, and was not constrained to consider any particular person for any office, provincial or federal, or to refer to other provinces in these matters. He furthermore fulminated against the \\"hereditary principle\\" for filling offices, as experience in other republics (both in antiquity and in contemporary Italy) had proved this a \\"peril to freedom.\\".Israel (1995), pp. 725‚Äì726 Though De Witt had achieved a diplomatic triumph by making peace with England without making any concession to England's commercial, colonial, and maritime interests (and introducing the principle of arbitration into international treaties for the first time, as the Treaty of Westminster left a number of conflicts to be resolved by international arbitration) this came with a heavy political price. Holland reigned supreme within the Republic for the moment, and Holland's commerce was not really damaged by the fact that England maintained its Navigation Acts (England not being an essential market for the Amsterdam Entrep√¥t). But the resentment of the Orangists, especially at being outsmarted, would later exact a heavy price.Israel (1995), p. 726 Commercial primacy The main cause for the war with the Commonwealth had been English resentment against the rapid inroads the Dutch made after the Peace of M√ºnster on the English trade with the Iberian peninsula, the Mediterranean and the Levant. During the resumption of the war with Spain between 1621 and 1647 the latter had instituted an effective trade embargo against the Dutch. Not only were Spanish and Portuguese ports closed to Dutch shipping, but Spain also was very successful in hindering Dutch trade in neutral bottoms, like Hanseatic ships, chartered at exorbitant rates by Dutch merchants. In 1624 a special inspectorate, the Almirantazgo was instituted to suppress this kind of \\"contraband\\" trade, that efficiently intercepted such shipments.Israel (1989), pp. 132‚Äì133 This partial disruption of direct trade with the Iberian lands made Dutch trade in the Mediterranean more difficult, because during the Twelve Year Truce the Dutch had captured a large slice of the trade in Spanish exports (wool, bullion) with Italy, which they lost after 1621. Most of this trade had been taken over by the English after the end of the Anglo-Spanish war in 1630, after which Spain and England cooperated amicably, including in the enforcement of the Spanish embargo on Dutch cargoes. More importantly, the depredations of the Dunkirk privateers on Dutch shipping caused maritime insurance premiums for Dutch voyages to rise appreciably, also in trade that was not related to Southern Europe. This partly negated the Dutch competitive advantage in shipping rates, helping other European nations to overcome the disadvantage of the higher rates they had to charge because of their inefficiency. The Dutch would normally be able to charge far lower rates, because they needed far smaller crews to man their more efficient ships.Israel (1989), pp. 197‚Äì198 All this changed after the embargo was lifted in 1647 (during the final peace negotiations). Dutch trade to Spain and Portugal, Italy and the Levant not only immediately rebounded to prewar levels, aided by the way the Spanish authorities facilitated the resumption of trade, but Dutch shipping rates and insurance premiums also fell to permanently lower levels. This stimulated Dutch carrying trade in the rest of Europe, causing a fundamental restructuring of Dutch trade in the years 1647‚Äì51 that went at the expense of the Republic's commercial rivals, especially (but not exclusively) England.Israel (1989), pp. 198‚Äì199 Harbour of Amsterdam by Willem van de Velde (1686) England could no longer compete in the carrying trade to Spain and Portugal; the Dover entrepot that had competed successfully with the Amsterdam one in the 1640s as far as the Mediterranean was concerned, completely collapsed; the transmission of silver to Flanders was switched by the Spanish bankers to Amsterdam from London. But England lost not just the carrying trade. Far more important was that the ascendancy of English textile exports to Spain was now lost, that had been total in the 1640s, as had been the English role in Spanish wool exports. Within a year or two this was completely reversed by the Dutch who in 1650 handled 80 percent of this trade. Dutch lakens and camlets took over the Spanish textile market, whereas Holland also took over the entrepot for Ibero-American dyestuffs.Israel (1989), p. 200 These gains were not just a matter of renewed access on favorable terms to the Iberian market, or greater efficiency. Equally important were other commercial advantages the Dutch had over their competitors, like fundamentally lower interest rates, and the productivity and profitably of the Dutch textile industry (due to technological innovations). The combination of these factors enticed Iberian wool exporters to opt for the Dutch market, and allowed Dutch merchants to prefinance Spanish dyestuff exports (like they also prefinanced Baltic grain exports and French wine exports).Israel (1989), p. 201 These changes had also ramifications in other theatres of trade, like the Baltic and the Levant, because the access of Dutch weavers to high-quality Spanish wool made Dutch textiles more attractive in the Baltic and the Levant than the previously ascendant English textiles. The consequence was a disastrous slump in the English textile industry after 1648. As the English were more dependent in their trade with the Baltic and Russia on their textile exports, their share in these trades therefore also declined.Israel (1989), p. 202 Likewise, the English had dominated the trade in spices and textiles with Italy and Turkey. England consumed most of the olive oil and currants exported from those lands. However, after 1648 here too occurred a complete reversal in favor of the Dutch. The Genoese shifted their purchases to the Dutch entrepot and started to use Dutch shipping for their carrying trade predominantly. This was mostly due to the far-lower shipping rates the Dutch charged. But other factors in the sudden rise of the share the Dutch obtained in the intra- Mediterranean trade were the grip they obtained on the trade in Spanish bullion (often reminted as Dutch trade coins of high quality) to the Levant, and the progress the Dutch fine-cloth industry made with their products that were of a higher quality than the English. As a result, the English were thrown on the defensive in this area, too. To add insult to injury more and more imports that had reached England directly before, were from now on re- exported from the Amsterdam entrepot in Dutch ships.Israel (1989), pp. 203‚Äì204 The sudden Dutch ascendancy also extended to the Americas, and especially the Caribbean. During the war with Spain, the Dutch had been successfully excluded from Spanish America. However, after the peace (though the Spanish still managed to boycott Dutch trade in the colonies effectively) the Dutch resumed their trade with certain colonies, like Puerto Rico, that they had already had a lively contraband trade with. Such a trade now also flared up with the English colonies that still were in Royalist hands in the early 1650s, particularly Barbados and Surinam. The sugar trade with these colonies for a large part compensated for the loss of the sugar production after the loss of Dutch Brazil in 1645. This disaster for the Dutch caused a spike in European sugar prices. But this had as a positive result that sugar production in French and English Caribbean islands was now stimulated, often with Dutch investment. The Dutch were, of course, happy to buy the sugar and provide the necessary slaves from their trading forts in West Africa.Israel (1989), p. 206 Of course, the English were not the only \\"victims.\\" The French, Scandinavian, and North-German merchants were also hit hard by the sudden resurgence of the Dutch in world markets. But the English were especially hit hard. This caused tremendous resentment, also because the English were not inclined to seek the fault with themselves, but suspected the Dutch of conspiring to engross world trade with means that could not be other than foul. However, this may be, the Commonwealth felt they could not take this Dutch \\"insolence\\" lying down. Unfortunately, unlike the Scandinavians and the Hanseatics, they were in a military position to do something about it. The Commonwealth government first tried peaceful means, like a haughty attempt to renew the English protectorate from Elizabethan and Jacobean days (based on the Treaty of Nonsuch) over the Republic, but this was politely rejected. Then Parliament passed the Navigation Act, which was intended to break the hold of the Dutch entrepot by prohibiting its re-exports to English markets, and also reserving the carrying trade to and from England to English bottoms. Of course, these blatantly protectionist measures most of all hurt the English economy and that of the English colonies. After all, the Dutch did not hold a pistol to the heads of their customers, but had achieved their ascendancy by offering better deals. English importers and consumers were now deprived of these benefits.Israel (1989), p. 208 Though a setback, these protectionist measures were not as devastating to the Dutch trade system as the English had intended. The English market in itself was not very important to the Dutch, compared to the French, Iberian, and American markets. The Commonwealth' writ did not yet run in the latter, so these markets were not immediately lost. The fact that England was able to continue this protectionist policy after the First Anglo-Dutch War had ended, was therefore not a severe blow to the Dutch. The damage from the war itself was severe for a while, but English commercial interests were damaged at least at much, if not more. The Dutch trade primacy was therefore not permanently damaged by the war, and neither did the English manage to regain their prewar position with force of arms. The only major consequence of the English policy was, that it gave ideas to first the Scandinavians, and later the French about the possibilities to use military and protectionist means, that later caused great difficulties to the Republic. Such problems started in the Baltic, where Denmark and Sweden in turn took steps that for a while damaged Dutch trade interests. The Dutch managed to counter these measures by military and diplomatic means, rolling back Danish increases of the Sound toll in 1649, and forcing the Swedes to retract mercantilist measures in the 1650s, but still the 1650s were a time of decline in the Dutch Baltic carrying trade, though this decline should not be exaggerated, as is often done. Before 1650 the Dutch had a share of 70 percent of total shipping movements; after 1650 this declined to 60 percent.Israel (1989), pp. 213‚Äì215 In the Mediterranean a kind of division of labor between the English and Dutch came into being after the war: the English were the main customers for olive oil and currants, and the Navigation Act therefore helped them to monopolize this trade. On the other hand, the Dutch monopolized the trade in spices and fine-cloth (the English being left with the trade in lower-value textiles). The English were the major buyers of Italian raw silk, whereas this trade was for the Dutch marginal in comparison with their Asian and Persian silk trade. Generally, the Dutch had a favorable balance of trade with this area (and the English a negative one), because the Dutch dominated more trades (like that in Baltic naval stores and salt) and more profitable ones.Israel (1989), pp. 226‚Äì227 As a matter of fact, the total value of the Mediterranean and Levant trade to the Dutch was about equal to that of the Far-Eastern trade of the VOC, both bringing in about 20 million guilders annually.Israel (1989), pp. 257‚Äì258 The fact that both France and England were at war with Spain between 1655 and 1659 (the French since 1635) helped reserve the Spanish trade to the Dutch in this period, as the Spanish embargo now was aimed at these competitors. When France was at peace with Spain, however, this country tended to dominate the Spanish trade, due to the strength of its linen exports both to Spain and its colonies. Though this influence may be exaggerated also: the French at this time had practically no part in the carrying trade, and the Dutch dominated the export of Spain's main export, raw wool. For political reasons (Portugal was at war with the Dutch in the same period over the aftermath of the reconquest of Dutch Brazil) the English predominated in the Portuguese trade. The Dutch dominated the salt trade with Portugal, however, also because the 1661 peace treaty stipulated that the war indemnity imposed on Portugal to compensate the WIC for the loss of Brazil, would be paid in that commodity. This was important, because Portuguese salt was better suited than high- magnesium French salt for the preservation of herring.Israel (1989), pp. 230‚Äì236 The dominance of the Dutch in the Far East also reached its zenith in these years, though not everything went the way of the VOC. The lucrative China-Japan trade, which the company had managed to monopolize for a while came to an end as the new Qing-regime finally managed to tighten its grip on the last remnants of the Ming in South China, and first reverse the terms of trade with the Dutch, before eventually completely closing the Chinese market to them. The VOC forts on Taiwan were lost to an adherent of the Ming, Koxinga, who in a move foreshadowing Chiang Kai-shek's flight to Taiwan in 1949, tried to make that island his base, but these forts had been mostly important in the silk trade with Japan, and that trade was now being taken over by the Chinese themselves anyway. The Japan trade lost most of its importance for the VOC, when in 1668 the sh≈çgun embargoed the export of silver, which the VOC had been using to finance most of its spice trade with. But because Spanish bullion was now again easily obtainable for the Dutch, this did not cramp the style of the VOC too much.Israel (1989), pp. 254‚Äì255 On a more positive note for the Dutch, the war with Portugal over compensation of the sister-company, the WIC, for her losses in Brazil to Portuguese insurgents, now provided the VOC with a convenient pretext to do away with the last remnants of the Portuguese trading empire in Ceylon and the Malabar and Coromandel coasts of India. Portuguese forts in these areas were conquered all the way to Goa; the local rulers were pressed to sign \\"exclusive-marketing contracts\\" with the VOC, conveniently excluding the English and Danes at the same time; and the VOC obtained the monopolies on Ceylonese cinnamon and elephants (useful in the trade with India).Israel (1989), pp. 249‚Äì257 The Anglo-Dutch conflicts were useful for the VOC for driving out its competitors, the EIC, from the Indonesian archipelago, by force of arms. In 1665 first the only English factory in the Spice Islands, Pulo Run was definitively conquered, excluding the English from the clove trade. More importantly, the VOC subsequently conquered the sultanates in Makassar, Jambi, and Palembang, forcing the sultans to exclude the English and Danes (who had previously maintained factories there) from the pepper trade.Israel (1989), pp. 252‚Äì253 Though the end of the war with Spain in 1648 enabled the VOC to greatly expand its empire by military means, and to hold European competitors at bay in the same manner (a fortress was built at the strategic Cape of Good Hope in 1653), it did not completely rely on force of arms for its commercial dominance. In Bengal, and the intra-Indian trade, for instance, the Dutch dominated at first by commercial means, consistently out-trading the English in commodities such as silk, rice, and opium, destined for other Asian markets. In these years the scale of the Dutch intra-Asian trade went unrivalled.Israel (1989), p. 256 This worldwide primacy in trade would not have been possible if it only rested on Dutch primacy in the carrying trade. After all, one has to trade something. Even where the counterparty is primarily interested in gold and silver as means of exchange, as in South-East Asia, that specie must be earned by a surplus on the balance of payments with other trading partners. A surplus in \\"invisibles\\", like shipping services, would not suffice to cover the enormous financing requirement of the spice trade. At first, the Dutch had little indigenous to offer, beyond herring and dairy products. But the industrial revolution of the early 17th century brought an industry into being that by the 1640s had matured enough to play an important part in Dutch exports. This industrial growth was partly innovation driven, stimulating all kinds of heretofore not seen mechanization, that greatly enhanced labor productivity, thereby driving down prices for Dutch products, even while nominal wages rose steeply at the same time. But the commerce-engendered Dutch control of many raw-material markets (like Spanish and Turkish raw wool, Swedish iron and copper, Ibero-American dyestuffs, Portuguese salt, French wine, Baltic grain, Scandinavian tar and wood, Caribbean sugar, American tobacco etc.) was an important factor in stimulating the booms of the industries that used those materials: textiles, guns, vinegar, shipbuilding, sugar and salt refining, tobacco blending, to name only a few. The Dutch entrepot was therefore supplied by an important domestic industrial sector, and not limited to reexporting wares obtained abroad. Industry and commerce were in this period closely integrated (though in later stages of the Dutch economy they would become disaggregated again, when foreign protection and a structurally high real-wage level forced the decline of the Dutch industrial sector).Israel (1989), pp. 259‚Äì269 An important factor in this industrial boom (as in the development of the fisheries) was, remarkably, the regulating role of the Dutch government: guaranteeing product quality gave Dutch products a reputation in foreign markets, that justified slightly higher prices, if need be. Other forms of market regulation, like the monopolies given to the VOC and WIC, but also the semi-official industry bodies that regulated the trade on Russia and the Levant, and the herring industry, helped stabilize market fluctuations. Patent protection helped stimulate industrial innovation. The sophisticated Dutch capital market was stabilized by regulated institutions like the Amsterdam Bank and Exchange, and the regulator of the insurance market. And maybe most importantly, the close connection of the Dutch regents to commercial interests in this period helped shield Dutch industry and commerce from excessive taxation or tariffs. Also, the Dutch government did not hesitate to put its not inconsiderable diplomatic and military might behind Dutch commercial interests, if the need arose to protect them against foreign protectionist measures.Israel (1989), p. 269 Diplomatic supremacy Though the Republic was only a small country, with a small population (about two million inhabitants when England had five million, and France already 20 million), these strategic drawbacks were more than compensated for by the economic and financial might of the Republic. Uniquely in Europe in this age, the Dutch state was able to tap the already sophisticated Dutch capital market, without having to go through banking intermediaries, to finance emergency military spending by borrowing. At the same time the taxing capacity was sufficient to service the still-manageable public debt this engendered. In case of need, the Republic could therefore rapidly expand its standing army by hiring mercenaries in \\"congenial\\" markets, like Scotland, the Protestant Swiss Cantons, and sundry Protestant German principalities, foremost Prussia. This was most spectacularly demonstrated in the months leading up to the Dutch invasion of England in 1688, when the standing army was simply doubled in size by hiring Prussian troops. But it also applied during most of the period under consideration (though it failed miserably in 1672, as we will see). However, in this period military threats did not come primarily from the land side, so there was little need for a large standing army, as there had been during the war with Spain. The Spanish Army of Flanders, with 70,000 men one of the largest standing armies in Europe at the time, was fully engaged in defending the Southern Netherlands against France up to the Peace of the Pyrenees in 1659. Spain would never again be a threat to the Republic from this quarter, actually hoping to conclude a defensive alliance against France. Though the Republic in these first years after the war with Spain was loath \\"to shore up a neighboring ruin\\" as De Witt remarked to the Spanish ambassador, the latter's reply that he would be wise to do so, \\"if he didn't want that ruin to fall on his head\\",Israel (1995), p. 778 later proved all too true. From 1667 on, the Republic was continually engaged in chasing the French out of the Spanish lands, and probably could have taken the Spanish Netherlands for itself, any time it wanted, but it preferred the Spanish Netherlands as a buffer state.Israel (1995), pp. 739‚Äì748 After the conflict with William II over the size of the army, which ended at his premature death, the now victorious regents lost little time in further reducing the size of the army. Unfortunately, they displayed the same parsimony to the navy, allowing the independent admiralties to sell off a large part of the fleet that had defeated the second Spanish Armada so resoundingly in neutral English waters in the Battle of the Downs of 1639. The foolishness of this policy was amply demonstrated in the First Anglo-Dutch War, when at least initially the Dutch navy did not stand a chance against the English fleet, at least in home waters, due to its qualitative and quantitative inferiority. While the war was still raging, the De-Witt regime therefore embarked on an ambitious program of naval construction and naval reform. The \\"new navy\\" was born that would become the pre-eminent instrument to project Dutch power abroad. The main innovation was that now sixty captains would be permanently employed by the navy, greatly increasing its professionalism. Due to the shallowness of Dutch home waters the size of the largest Dutch ships could still not be equal to that of the English first-rates, but the gap in weight of guns was narrowed.Israel (1995), pp. 716‚Äì717 This new navy would only be truly tested in the Second Anglo-Dutch War, as England was the Republic's only naval rival in these years, and neither country was keen to test the other so soon after the first war, that had been so costly to both sides. Besides, the Commonwealth was soon embroiled in a war with Spain, joining the Franco-Spanish War (1635) on the French side, in which the Republic remained neutral, content to reap the commercial benefits from the new-won Spanish friendship. However, the new navy proved useful in the smaller conflicts in which the Republic became soon engaged in Scandinavia and Portugal. Due to the importance of the Dutch Baltic trade for Amsterdam and the northern Holland port cities, the Dutch were always keenly interested in what happened around the Sound. Already in the 1640s the Republic had intervened in the Torstenson War of king Christian IV of Denmark with Sweden, putting its thumb in the scales, both by military intervention in favor of the Swedes, and by favoring that country in the subsequent peace mediation that resulted in the Treaty of Br√∂msebro. Denmark had made itself unpopular in Dutch eyes by siding with Spain in the war and by unilaterally increasing the toll on Dutch shipping. At first there was little the Dutch could do, but when Christian provoked the Swedes to invade Jutland in 1643, the Dutch applauded, but did little more than offer diplomatic support, because the Zeeland and Rotterdam interests were loath to spend good money to defend the Amsterdam interests (the Orangists still being in the ascendant in this period). When the Swedes in consequence showed little enthusiasm to help lower tolls for the Dutch in the peace negotiations of 1644, the States General were finally forced to put their money where their mouth was. A Dutch fleet of 48 warships was assembled that, in July, 1645, escorted three hundred Dutch merchant vessels through the Sound, making a show of not paying any toll at all. The Danish monarch watched the imposing spectacle in person from the ramparts of the castle of Helsing√∏r, being politely saluted by the Dutch. The king made no response. A few months later a treaty was signed with the Dutch that formed the basis for their commercial ascendancy throughout the 17th century in the Baltic trade. Tolls for the Dutch were lowered; Dutch shipping would be exempt from visitation by Danish officials; Dutch shipping would be totally exempt from the toll at Gl√ºckstadt.Israel (1989), pp. 148‚Äì149 Battle of the Sound by Samuel von Pufendorf But soon the Dutch would have occasion to come to the aid of the Danes in a conflict with Sweden. In 1654 Charles X Gustav of Sweden ascended the Swedish throne and he embarked on an aggressive policy, in the process harming Dutch interests in several ways. He blockaded the port of Danzig during the Polish part of the Northern Wars, hindering Dutch commerce. In July, 1656 Cornelis de Graeff sent a fleet under Jacob van Wassenaer Obdam of the new Dutch navy. The fleet was dispatched to Danzig which helped persuade the Swedes to lift this blockade. Obdam was the commander-in-chief of the Dutch navy in these years, a political appointment by De Witt, who preferred an officer of the right political color to be in charge, in preference to more competent, but politically undesirable Orangists, when Witte Corneliszoon de With and Michiel de Ruyter (both States- Party men) were unavailable for different reasons. As Obdam was basically a landlubber, this was not an ideal solution, but in this context he proved up to the job. Unfortunately, the Danish king Frederick III of Denmark (who had been a staunch ally of the Dutch in the war with the Commonwealth, despite his father's humiliation in 1645), now declared war on Charles. Charles proved himself to be an astute military tactician by soon overrunning the Danish isles, threatening to dominate both sides of the Sound. This the Dutch could not allow, and (though Zeeland and the South Holland regents again at first obstructed action, because they myopically did not see the Dutch interest in intervention) Obdam was again dispatched with a fleet to the scene of the crime. This time he defeated the Swedes in the Battle of the Sound and relieved besieged Copenhagen.Israel (1989), p. 219 The English now decided that the Dutch had gone too far, and intervened in their turn by sending a fleet to oppose the Dutch, and shore up Swedish determination. Reluctantly (because they did not relish another hot war with the Commonwealth) the States General called this bluff, by sending a second fleet, under the command of De Ruyter, in the Summer of 1659. The combined Dutch fleets, 78 ships and 17,000 men, anchored provocatively in the Sound close to the combined Anglo-Swedish fleet. After some brooding staring from both sides, the English decided to go home again. The Dutch then proceeded by ejecting the Swedes from Nyborg, making the Swedish position untenable. Charles now sued for peace. He agreed to give up his conquests in Denmark, and to retract a number of protectionist measures against Dutch shipping.Israel (1989), p. 221 The Dutch had thus in fact imposed a pax neerlandica on the Baltic region. They leaned then to the Danes, then to the Swedes, but never forgot Dutch interests in the process. This was, of course, highly resented by all parties involved, not least the English, and also France, which now began to revive from its weak diplomatic position during the minority of Louis XIV of France and the subsequent ministry of Cardinal Mazarin. During the early 1660s English diplomats were highly successful in fomenting all kinds of trouble for the Dutch in Copenhagen and Stockholm. Denmark, in particular, seemed amenable to a reversal of alliances in the events leading up to the Second Anglo-Dutch War. However, when that war broke out, the Danes decided that they simply could not afford to go against Dutch wishes, and they again sided with the Republic by closing the Sound to English commerce.Israel (1989), pp. 222‚Äì223 The point here is that the Dutch did not have to press the Danes by obvious military means; diplomacy sufficed. The English envoy to Denmark, Sir Gilbert Talbot, regretfully remarked (quoting the reply of the Danish government to his protest): Dutch economic might was sufficient to sway not just the Danes, but other European powers also. The Dutch economic primacy might be resented, but most Europeans preferred it to that of the English and French, as the Dutch lacked the manpower and political ambition to translate their economic might into political domination. In this case of the 1665 war with England, Sweden, which usually opposed Denmark, also calculated that it was better off with a Dutch win. This applied all over Europe (except in Portugal, that was still hurting from the recent war with the Republic). Hamburg (a keen competitor of the Dutch) helped the Dutch stop the supply of naval stores to England and provided the \\"neutral\\" ships to carry Dutch trade through the English blockade. In Italy, public opinion showed itself quite pro-Dutch after the Four Days Battle of June, 1666, which ended arguably in a draw, but was claimed by the propagandists of both sides as a victory. In Leghorn the dock- workers rioted against the English, and the English flag was run up on the steeple of the main basilica upside down under the Dutch flag. Spain allowed Dutch privateers to auction English prizes at Corunna.Israel (1989), pp. 275‚Äì277 The Dutch States-Party regents were no pacifists. When Portugal refused to make amends for its reconquest of the colonies in Africa (Angola) and America (Dutch Brazil) from the WIC in 1648, the shareholders of that company who were heavily represented in Zeeland and in the land provinces (Overijssel and Guelders), convinced the States General to declare war on Portugal in 1657 (though the company had expressly been given sovereign powers to take care of its own affairs). Though this stretched Dutch naval resources rather thin, just at the time the business with Sweden in the Sound had to be dealt with, the Dutch blockaded Lisbon for a while, and Dutch privateers hampered Portuguese shipping. The Dutch did most of their damage in Ceylon and India, however, as we have seen above. These Dutch successes stimulated England (that had been sabotaging the Luso-Dutch peace negotiations, because the war helped reserve Portuguese trade to themselves) to drop their objections to the Treaty of The Hague (1661). In this treaty, De Witt's conviction that trade was more important than colonial possessions, and that the war had been a mistake, got the upper hand. The Republic dropped its demands for restitution of the lost colonies in exchange for a handsome indemnity. But the damage to Luso-Dutch relations had already been done, and the Republic was never again able to replace England in Portuguese trade.Israel (1989), p. 219; Israel (1995), pp.757‚Äì758 The example of the relations with Portugal illustrated that De Witt's diplomatic gifts were necessary as much within the Republic, as without. He always had to make internal deals to accompany the external deals he made with foreign powers. In the case of the Hague treaty, Zeeland at first refused to ratify (and the requirement of unanimity in cases of peace and war in the Union of Utrecht made its position strong). De Witt persuaded the Zeeland States to acquiesce by giving the Zeeland salt-refiners the best part of the business of refining the salt that Portugal paid as its indemnity.Israel (1995), p. 758 But bribery played a big part in foreign relations also. A good example is the Dutch Gift the States General gave to Charles II of England in 1660 to get back in his good graces after the coolness of the mutual relations that reigned during Charles's years of exile in France. The bribe consisted of a number of precious paintings worth the not inconsiderable sum of 80,000 guilders, and the yacht HMY Mary, like the yacht on which he was comfortably transported home to England during the Restoration. The gift was mostly paid for by the Amsterdam vroedschap, who came to regret their unaccustomed generosity when Charles unfolded his anti-Dutch policy. Fortunately, most of the paintings were repatriated to the Netherlands by William III of England after he had become king, so the financial outlay had not been a complete waste.Israel (1995), pp. 749‚Äì750 Usually generous gifts had their intended effects, however. During the stadtholderate Dutch officials in their turn had been the happy recipients of diplomatic largesse themselves. However, the De Witt regime was unusually impervious to corruption itself, as the French ambassador complained in 1653, because the power was so diffused that one did no longer know whom to bribe, with the consequence that \\"...cette d√©pense serait infinie et infructueuse.Israel (1995), p. 702 The \\"True Freedom\\" That dispersion of power, though seen by many, then and later, as a major weakness of the Republic, was actually the foundation stone of De Witt's political system, that he called de Ware Vrijheid (the \\"True Freedom\\"). We have already seen that De Witt primarily defended Oldenbarnevelt's and Grotius' claim to supremacy of (Holland's) provincial sovereignty over the sovereignty of the Generality under this moniker. But the doctrine went further. \\"True Freedom\\" implied the rejection of an \\"eminent head\\", not only of the federal state (where it would have conflicted with provincial sovereignty), but also of the provincial political system. De Witt considered Princes and Potentates as such, as detrimental to the public good, because of their inherent tendency to waste tax payer's money on military adventures in search of glory and useless territorial aggrandizement. As the province of Holland only abutted friendly territory, the Holland regents had no territorial designs themselves, and they looked askance at such designs by the other provinces, because they knew they were likely to have to foot the bill anyway. The Republic therefore from time to time threw its weight around in the German principalities to the East, but always to protect strategic interests, not for territorial gain. Likewise, after the dispute over the Overmaas territory (which still had been left over from the Munster treaty) was settled with the partition treaty of 1661 with Spain, there were no further territorial claims in the Southern Netherlands, till after the War of Spanish Succession fundamentally changed the strategic situation. The rejection of the dynastic claims of the House of Orange therefore was not just a matter of defending the political patronage of one particular political faction, against the aspirations to lucrative political office of another faction. It was a matter of principle to the States Party: they were against the notion of any \\"eminent head\\" of the Dutch state, not just the Prince of Orange. The absence of such an \\"eminent head\\" was to them a mark of superiority of the Dutch political system over other forms of government. The fact that compromise was a constant feature of the Dutch political landscape, and that often the pace of decision-making was glacial, was also viewed in a not necessarily negative light. (Besides, as was abundantly proved during the reign of William III, when he had obtained the stadtholdership after 1672, an \\"eminent head\\" did not necessarily eliminate the need for compromise, or speed up decision-making). Like his contemporaries as statesmen, such as Mazarin, De Witt was a raison d'√©tat statesman, but his raison d'√©tat had a different content. Unlike the princely version, his disdained territorial aggrandizement, military capability for its own sake, and concentration of power in the central state. Instead, he strove to ensure security of the Dutch state, its independence from outside interference, and advancement of its trade and industry, all elements being intended to benefit the society of which the regent class were the proper representatives. The Republic, in De Witt's view, sought to attain goals which were commensurate with the interests of its citizens, not in conflict with them, as the goals of absolutist rulers often were.Israel (1995), p. 738 Needless to say, the Orangist party saw things differently. Their adherence to the Prince of Orange's dynastic interest was partly a matter of personal advancement, as many Orangist regents resented being ousted from the offices they had monopolized under the Stadtholderate. But many people also had a genuine ideological attachment to the \\"monarchical\\" principle. Calvinism felt theological unease with a political system that did not have a Prince at its head, as such a system did not seem to be justifiable in biblical terms (at least if one overlooked the Book of Judges in preference to Books of Kings). As the analogy of the Dutch Republic with the biblical People of Israel was never far from people's minds, this helped to give an important underpinning for the Orangist claims in the mind of the common people, who were greatly influenced from the pulpit. Of course, the Public Church thought its interests best served by the Stadtholder, as the Erastianism of the Holland regents was seen as a constant threat to its independence. An example of what this threat might entail was the controversy about the formulary the States of Holland imposed in 1663 for prayers in favor of the government. Such prayers were said as a matter of routine in Dutch Reformed churches throughout the life of the Republic; it was an uncontested obligation following from its status as the Public Church. The problem in the view of the Holland regents, however, was first that the \\"wrong\\" sequence was observed: the States General were given precedence over the provincial states, and secondly that prayers were also said for that \\"private citizen\\", the Prince of Orange. The States therefore now prescribed that prayers for the States General should be said last, and those for the States of Holland first, and that the Prince of Orange (13 years at the time) should be omitted. Though this formulary only applied to the province of Holland, and the clergy (mindful of their livings) complied with discreetly gnashing teeth, the other provinces erupted in a furore. The States of Friesland took this opportunity to challenge the doctrine of provincial sovereignty head-on, and claimed that the formulary went contrary to the Acts of the Dort Synod, that had settled the church in 1619. Zeeland almost supported Friesland, but De Witt managed to get the Zeeland States (who always had to mind their volatile Calvinist base) to prevaricate.Israel (1995), pp. 761‚Äì763 This incident illustrates that in the Republic the relationship between Church and State always remained problematic, even though it had seemed to be settled in favor of the church in 1619. Though the regents knew better than to interfere in matters of doctrine (as they were accused of doing in 1618), they thought they had certain rights of oversight in return for the privileged status of the Reformed Church. The clergy, on the other hand, had never reconciled itself to such oversight, and on the contrary was of the opinion that the Church had a right to oversee public policy. As the regents would never concede such a right there was a constant tension between the two, not least in the matter of tolerance, or rather, Toleration. The Union of Utrecht had guaranteed freedom of conscience,Israel (1995), p. 500 but this did not imply freedom of worship. Except for the Dutch Reformed Church, public worship by other denominations was usually restricted with more or less severity, and membership of the privileged church was supposed to be a prerequisite for holding public office (though this rule was often honored in the breach, even as far as Catholic office holders in the Generality Lands were concerned). This policy of supremacy of the Public Church was, however, never enforced consistently, either in the different parts of the country, or over time. In general, a policy of de facto toleration predominated, even when legal prohibitions were in force. This went against the grain of the Calvinist diehards, who constantly insisted on official suppression of competing faiths, going back to the Contra-Remonstrant controversy of 1618. Their Remonstrant opponents had come to defend religious toleration after their own suppression, and though Remonstrant regents had been ousted at the time, this political point of view remained in favor with the Holland regents, unlike their colleagues in most other provinces. The debate continued to flare up from time to time.Israel (1995), pp. 499‚Äì505 The flap over the Holland public prayers was just one of many instances. What makes it interesting is that such debates were usually not over doctrinal matters, but in a sense about \\"public order.\\" Also, they tended quickly to widen to debates over unsettled constitutional matters, like the provincial-supremacy claim of the Holland regents. Because of this intermingling of matters that at first view would not seem to be directly related, one discernes a peculiar line-up in the ideological debate of the times, that is contrary to many myths that have arisen in later historiography. Though privately they might be as intolerant as any person, the Holland regents for political reasons were often in favor of religious toleration, and freedom of thought, because their political opponents were in alliance with the forces of religious intolerance in the Calvinist church. On the other hand, the Orangist faction often supported intolerance, because they craved the support of the preachers. As toleration did not have the favorable press it has in our times, this was actually a weak point in the armor of the De-Witt regime. There was a need for ideological justification of these policies against accusations of allowing abominations as \\"atheism\\" and \\"libertinism\\" from the side of the Consistory. There was therefore a healthy public debate in the form of pamphlets published by both sides. Most of these have only an interest as curiosities, but some have exercised lasting influence, also outside the Republic. In the controversy about the Holland formulary a cousin and almost namesake of De Witt, Johan de Wit (with one t), published one pseudonymously in 1663‚Äì4, under the title Public Gebedt.Consideratien : over verscheyde notabele pointen, voortgebracht ter occasie van het bidden, voor de overheden, hier te lande in het Public-gebedt This asserted that the form of government of the Republic (as preferred by the Holland regents) was the \\"most excellent\\" and chosen by God himself, while he quoted Tacitus to say that prayers for any but the sovereign power in public ceremonies weaken the state. This heavy tome would be unremarkable if it were not for the fact that De Witt is believed to have vetted the book himself, and thus given it his tacit imprimatur.Israel (1995), p. 763 In the same way, De Witt is thought to have lent a hand in revising a major work by Pieter de la Court, published in 1662: Interest van Hollandt.H.H. Rowen, John de Witt: Grand Pensionary of Holland (Princeton, N.J., 1978), pp. 391‚Äì5, as cited in Israel (1995), p. 760, fn. 61 The disparaging remarks about the stadtholderate in this work, which amounted to the assertion that princes (and by implication stadtholders) have an interest in keeping the world in perpetual conflict, because they wield more influence in such circumstances, incensed the Orangist public. Another work by De la Court, Political DiscoursesPolitike discoursen handelende in ses onderscheide boeken van steeden, landen, oorlogen, regeringen, kerken en zeeden. Beschreeven door D.C. caused even more of a furore. In it he denounces all (quasi-)monarchy as harming the true interest of the citizen (which he distinguishes from the subjects of monarchies), because hereditary power subordinates the public good to dynastic concerns. For good measure he added that it was necessary for the public good to curb the influence of the Public Church outside its proper sphere in the spiritual domain. This, of course, earned him the enmity of the leadership of his Leyden church that barred him from the Lord's Supper in retaliation.Israel (1995), p. 760 This anticlericalism was not left unanswered. The leader of the conservative Calvinists, Gisbertus Voetius, published the first volume of his Politica Ecclesiastica in 1663, in which he attacked (in Latin) De Witt and the Erastian policies of the regents. Possibly by Voetius also, but in any case by someone close to him, was the Resurrected Barnevelt,Den ver-resenen Barnevelt, betabbert met alle sijne politycke maximen in which the anonymous writer, writing in Dutch, attacked the provincial-supremacy doctrine and the prayer formulary as an insidious attempt to make the other six provinces subservient to Holland. To which possibly De Witt himself replied with a scalding pamphlet, entitled Schotschen Duyvel Den Schotschen duyvel, betabbert in den Verresenen Barnevelt, den Gulden legende van den nieuwen Sint Jan, den Bedunckelicken brief, zijn vervolgh, en sulcke brandt-schriften meer, met alle sijne jesuitsche maximen van 'tpresbyterisch convenant en 'tUtrechtsch presbytery. Uyt de gemeene lessen en legenden van Gisbertus Voetius, aerts- muyt-meester in which he denounced Voetius by name as a master-mutineer.Israel (1995), p. 765 The great Dutch playwright Joost van den Vondel, a partisan of Oldenbarnevelt, reissued his play Palamedes that in a veiled way deplored the execution of Oldenbarnevelt, in these years (it had been suppressed under the Stadtholderate before 1650). It was performed in Rotterdam in 1663 and elicited a forgettable Orangist counterblast in the form of the tragedy Wilhem, of gequetste vryheit by the rector of the Dordrecht Latin school, Lambert van de Bosch. Vondel felt sufficiently provoked to write Batavische gebroeders of Onderdruckte vryheit (1663), his last political play, in which he explicitly defended the \\"True Freedom\\" against Orangism. Baruch Spinoza Though these contributions to Dutch literature were a happy byproduct of the controversy, more important from the standpoint of enduring political science were the key publications by the democratic republican theorists around Baruch Spinoza that were published at the end of the 1660s. Franciscus van den Enden, Spinoza's mentor, went beyond the De la Court brothers in his espousal of political democracy in his Free Political Propositions,Vrije Politijke Stellingen published in 1665, which is one of the first systematic statements of democratic republicanism in the western world. Van den Enden argued that government should not only be in the interest of the citizens (as De la Court had proposed), but should create equality of opportunity and be controlled by the people, not the regent oligarchy. Van den Ende acknowledged only two writers that had preceded him with such ideas to his knowledge: Johan de la Court (Pieter's brother with his Considerati√´n van Staat of 1660), and Pieter Corneliszoon Plockhoy, whose English-language pamphlet A way propounded to make the poor in these and other nations happy (published in London in 1659) also took aristocrats and priests to task. Plockhoy and Van den Ende first tried to implement their ideas in New Netherland in the early 1660s. (2006), Enlightenment Contested. Philosophy, Modernity, and the Emancipation of Man 1670‚Äì1752, Oxford U.P. , pp. 250‚Äì251 Spinoza, in his Tractatus theologico- politicus, tried to give Van den Enden's political ideas a foundation in his own philosophy, by pointing out that democracy is the best form of government \\"approaching most closely to that freedom which nature grants to every man\\".Israel (2006), p. 252 Contrary to the thinking of Thomas Hobbes, Spinoza posited that Man does not give up the rights he possesses in the state of Nature to the State, when he enters the social contract. To him therefore leaving Man as close as possible to that state of Nature is important, and he thinks that democracy accomplishes this best, as it is \\"the most natural\\" and \\"rational\\" form of government. This theme runs through most Dutch republican doctrine of the 17th century, before resurfacing in the work of the mid-18th- century French republican philosophers, and ultimately in the French Revolution. Like the De la Court brothers, and Van den Enden, Spinoza stressed the importance of unlimited toleration and freedom of expression. They went much farther in this respect than John Locke, whose Epistola de tolerantiaA Letter Concerning Toleration was published in Latin and Dutch in Gouda in 1689, after having been written during Locke's exile in the Republic. Locke did not go further than the Dutch Remonstrants, like Simon Episcopius, in their 1620s polemics about toleration. His was a basically conservative, limited conception of toleration, that was acceptable to \\"mainstream\\" thinking of the time, though he denied toleration to atheists and non-monotheist religions.Israel (2006), p. 138 ff. (One has to take into account that Locke was an Englishman, writing for an English public that was scarcely ready for notions of toleration, as William III ‚Äì no flaming liberal himself ‚Äì was to discover from the wall of opposition that his attempts to convey toleration on English Catholics encountered later that year). The Spinozists clothed their demands for toleration in a virulent anticlericalism, because experience had taught them that if the Church was left with autonomy in the state, its prestige would allow it to mobilize the masses against anyone of whose ideas the clergy would disapprove. They insisted consequently on completely eliminating the autonomy, privileges, property, dominance of education, and censorship functions of the clergy. Lodewijk Meyer, a friend of Spinoza, formulated this in his De jure ecclesiaticorum, as did Pieter de la Court in his Aanwijsing der Heilsame Politieke Gronden (a reformulation of his Interest van Holland, that he published in 1669). It was this anticlericalism that made them vulnerable to attacks by the clergy, leading to the suppression of the Aanwijsing by the States of Holland at the request of the South-Holland Synod in 1669. Spinoza published his Tractatus exclusively in Latin (and objected against attempts to publish translations in French and Dutch), because he hoped in that way to cause as little provocation as possible to the regents.Israel (2006), pp. 160, 253; Israel (1995), pp. 789‚Äì790 Nevertheless, such censorship was the exception rather than the rule. As long as one took care to be discreet, and did not cross the boundaries of \\"blasphemy\\" as Adriaan Koerbagh was accused of having done in 1669, the authorities were prepared to turn a blind eye to this kind of radical publications (though freedom of the press did not exist de jure). The \\"True Freedom\\" as a political concept was accompanied by intellectual freedom in practice, and this practical freedom engendered the formulation of philosophical justifications thereof, that would resound in the later Enlightenment. The Second Anglo- Dutch War, 1665‚Äì1667 If the Dutch Republicans wanted an example of a Prince who fomented trouble by foreign military adventures to the detriment of the common good, they only had to point across the English Channel to the uncle of the Prince of Orange, Charles II of England. Charles had been restored to the throne of his father in 1660, after first apparently making his peace with the Dutch regents, who had treated him so scornfully after 1654. The end of the Protectorate in England had given the Dutch regents hope that the new English regime might be less bellicose than the Commonwealth. To ensure the good graces of Charles he was extensively f√™ted during his stay in the Netherlands before his triumphant return to England. It was hoped that the Dutch Gift would further mellow his feelings toward the Dutch, maybe even persuade him to rescind the Navigation Acts. Charles took the opportunity to further the interests of his sister Mary and nephew William (now ten years old) by emphasizing his great affection for both. The Orangists, of course, needed little encouragement to add this to their quiver of arguments in favor of dynastic preferment. But also many opportunistic States-Party regents, discerning a change in the wind, started to make pro-Orange noises, especially in the Amsterdam vroedschap. This disturbed De Witt no end, as he feared that this would undermine the position of his party.Israel (1995), pp. 748‚Äì749 Peace Congress of Breda 1667 Amsterdam now started pushing a special embassy to England that would negotiate a treaty of friendship with Charles II and a defensive alliance against third-party aggression. They hoped to persuade the king to formally rescind the Navigation Acts, and to agree to the principle of \\"Free Ship, Free Goods\\" (by which they meant an immunity of neutral ships from visitation and confiscation of contraband in time of war), the latter to prevent a recurrence of the English capture of neutral Dutch shipping in the recent Anglo-Spanish War (1654‚Äì60). The very generous gift to Charles at first seemed to have the desired effect.Israel (1995), p. 750 However, soon the hopes of the Dutch peace-mongers were dashed with the re-appointment of Sir George Downing as English ambassador in The Hague. Downing had also represented the Commonwealth since 1657, but switched his support to the new r√©gime in time. He was not a friend of the Dutch, as they well knew. On his return he immediately started meddling in Dutch internal affairs by stoking up Orangist sentiment and by undermining De Witt where possible. The situation was ripe for this, as the Princess Mary had made great advances since August, 1660, convincing Zeeland and Friesland to come out in favor of promising a future stadtholdership for William. The other provinces did not recognize the Act of Exclusion, as we have seen, and even Holland started to have second thoughts. Leiden and Haarlem proposed that the Prince would be designated stadtholder in future, and De Witt deflected this with some difficulty, at the same time making financial concessions to William's mother, promising to pay for his education as \\"Child of State\\". To further mollify her (in hopes of her influencing her brother in favor of the Dutch), the Act of Exclusion was formally revoked in September, 1660 (the Commonwealth having expired as a state, this could be excused as not being a breach of treaty).Israel (1995), pp. 751‚Äì753 However, the improvement of De Witt's personal relations with the Prince and his mother came to nought when she suddenly died (24 December 1660), like her late husband also of smallpox. She appointed her brother Charles as William's guardian in her will. This gave the King of England formal stature to interfere in his nephew's education, and in Dutch affairs of state. At the same time, the negotiations about the treaty were not going well. Not only did Charles refuse to retract the Navigation Acts, but he even re-issued them in his own name. A further protectionist measure was the bill before the Cavalier Parliament to restrict fishing in a zone of ten miles from the English coast (though in those days territorial waters were supposed to go no further than three miles). This the Dutch would not recognize.Israel (1995), p. 752 However, the English obstructionism, also in the matter of the peace with Portugal (which Downing helped to frustrate for a long time) actually helped in the end to unify the Dutch politicians behind De Witt. The Amsterdam regents, seeing that they did not get anywhere with Charles, lost interest in the cause of the Prince. Holland therefore reunited, and the recalcitrant provinces had no chance against a united Holland. Zeeland was brought back in the fold by the aggressive behavior of the new Royal African Company (RAC) against the WIC (in which Zeeland traditionally had an important interest) in West Africa. This threat to its own interests by the English (and especially William's royal uncles) helped cool Zeeland's fervor for the Orangist cause in 1661.Israel (1995), p. 754 This left only Friesland to support a pro-English course. At Frisian insistence during 1662 the Republic made a concerted effort to conclude the sought-for treaty with England, even if it meant making concessions in the case of trumped-up English demands for compensation for alleged damages in the East Indies. Meanwhile, however, De Witt managed to conclude a treaty of alliance with France in April 1662, among other things guaranteeing the threatened Dutch fisheries. De Witt now felt strengthened enough to start demanding recall of the Dutch plenipotentiaries in England if they could make no progress with the proposed English treaty. Downing, however, calculated that Friesland, and the land provinces, could be counted upon to keep the Dutch position weak, as he thought they would refuse to pay their share of the cost of a war with England. This was in itself not improbable, if only because the land provinces felt threatened by Bernhard von Galen, the Prince-Bishop of M√ºnster, who made territorial demands on parts of Overijssel in the early 1660s. They, not unreasonably, demanded military protection against this aggressor from the Generality. However, Downing miscalculated. De Witt managed to strengthen his position and to start a program of naval rearmament in the summer of 1662. Nevertheless, in the autumn of the same year the Netherlands actually signed a treaty of alliance with England. But relations between the two countries had become so strained that it probably was not worth the parchment it was written on.Israel (1995), pp. 755‚Äì758 Relations continued to deteriorate during 1663 and early 1664. Charles faced the same problem that his father had faced: financial arrangements that kept hm short of money. Parliament had voted him a seemingly generous grant from the customs and excise duties for life, but his financial needs were greater, and he consequently constantly sought additional sources of income. The chartered companies, like the EIC and the RAC, looked promising in this respect, but their profitability depended on a rather predatory method of doing business that brought them in conflict with (especially) their Dutch competitors, the VOC and the WIC. The EIC was no match for the VOC, but the WIC was in its turn weaker than the RAC. The latter company managed in 1664 to conquer most of the trading posts of the WIC in West Africa, while in the same year an English expedition, outfitted by the Duke of York, Charles' brother, captured the WIC colony of New Netherland. These acts of war happened in peacetime. The English were confident that the Dutch, because of their supposed internal divisions, would not react forcefully. Again this was a miscalculation. De Witt ordered Vice-Admiral De Ruyter, who was at the time cruising in the Mediterranean, to retake the WIC forts (even though the WIC was supposed to handle its own affairs; in a way by involving the Dutch navy, De Witt was therefore raising the stakes in the conflictIsrael (1995), pp. 766‚Äì778). Charles declared war in March 1665. Most European courts considered the Dutch the weaker party because (other than the Dutch republican theorists, as we have seen) they considered the Dutch system of government inferior to the English absolute monarchy. Downing predicted that the Dutch would capitulate without a fight. Even if they would fight, they would be hopelessly divided. He expected the land provinces to refuse to pay for the war, or to contribute in other ways to the war. In this he was to be disappointed. Even though the war went badly at first for the Dutch (mainly due to the inferiority of their ships and to poor command), things soon started to pick up when the Dutch naval construction program started to bear fruit, and De Ruyter was put in overall command. Patriotic fervor among the population helped to subdue Orangist dissension for the duration of the war. The inland provinces not only paid their share, but even did this with alacrity. Friesland even raised special loans for its increased share. The fact that bishop von Galen, in alliance with England, invaded the eastern provinces in 1665, and even threatened Friesland, after having overrun Drenthe, probably concentrated Frisian minds wonderfully in this respect.Israel (1995), pp. 768‚Äì770 The initial military d√©b√¢cle this provoked for the Dutch army did cause trouble for the De Witt regime. De Witt's brother Cornelis, who acted as deputy-in-the-field (a kind of political commissar) to the army's commander- in-chief John Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen (a cousin twice-removed of the Prince of Orange, who however, was acceptable to the States Party) was implicated in the initial panicky retreat behind the IJssel, that left the eastern provinces unprotected. However, now the French intervened, thanks to De Witt's treaty of alliance of 1662. French forces helped stabilize the Dutch front, and when promised English subsidies failed to materialize, von Galen was forced to retreat ignominiously. He concluded a humiliating peace in early 1666.Israel (1995), pp. 770‚Äì772 Things started to look up for the Dutch in the naval war also. Both countries had each other in a strategic death-grip. The English might be stronger in their home waters, but as in the first Anglo- Dutch conflict, the Dutch were able to close down English communications farther afield. This time also, the Danes joined the war on the Dutch side, shored up by a Dutch fleet, and closed the Sound to English shipping and trade. The Hanseatics, on the other hand, ostensibly neutral, helped the Dutch circumvent any English blockades. In the Mediterranean the parties made trade impossible for each other. In the East Indies the VOC swept the EIC from the seas and took this opportunity to help itself to the last remaining English toeholds in the Indonesian archipelago. In other words, English trade was devastated, with predictable results for the economy, and for Charles' finances. This was the crucial factor. The English might arguably win a few more naval battles, and even inflict appreciable damage, as in the raid by admiral Holmes in August, 1666, but the end was never in doubt. The strangulating grip of the Dutch blockade got worse by the day, even preventing coal from Newcastle reaching cold Londoners during the winter of 1666.Israel (1995), p. 773 By 1667 Charles had run out of money. He was forced to lay up his fleet, giving free rein to the Dutch blockade. In June 1667, De Ruyter, now ably assisted by Cornelis de Witt, again as deputy-in-the-field, performed his daring Raid on the Medway, a day that went down in English infamy. But it was less a feat of Dutch arms than one of Dutch finance, as it would not have been possible without the Dutch government simply outspending the English till the latter became exhausted. The end came soon thereafter. Charles sued for peace and the Dutch achieved most of their war aims with the Treaty of Breda (1667). The Dutch declined to take back New Amsterdam in exchange for Surinam, a decision that may seem unconscionable in modern American eyes, but which in the circumstances of the time must be deemed completely rational: the sugar plantations of Surinam were certainly more valuable than the already hard- pressed fur traders in their environment of hostile New-Englanders. In any case, the next time round, in 1673, the Dutch effortlessly retook \\"New York\\" (as it was then styled), renaming it \\"New Orange\\", but they again relinquished it to the English, because other things were more valuable. More important in the long run was that Charles had to recognize the Dutch doctrine of \\"Free Ship, Free Goods\\" in the treaty (a concession that was confirmed at the Treaty of Westminster (1674)). This protected neutral Dutch shipping during the many English wars of the 18th century in which the Dutch did not take part, up to the American Revolutionary War (1775‚Äì1783). Also, the Navigation Acts were modified in the sense that the German hinterland was recognized as a legitimate place of origin for Dutch commerce, appreciably softening the protectionist bite of those Acts. The territorial concessions of the English were insignificant in comparison.Israel (1995), p. 774 An intriguing internal political accompaniment to the war was the affair that has become known as the \\"Buat Conspiracy\\". Henri Buat, a French officer in the Dutch States Army, was part of the retinue of the young Prince of Orange. He was engaged, at a low level, in an English conspiracy to bring about an Orangist coup d'√©tat in August, 1666, to overthrow the De Witt regime, end the war, and restore the stadtholderate. Buat, who handled English diplomatic correspondence with the knowledge and consent of De Witt, handed over the wrong letter to the Dutch pensionary in a moment of confusion. This letter exposed the plot and the main plotters. One of them was Johan Kievit, the corrupt Rotterdam regent who would play an ignominious role in the murder of the De Witt brothers in 1672. Though the whole affair was rather farcical, it strengthened De Witt's hand appreciably against his Orangist opponents. De Witt was able to tighten his hold on the \\"Child of State\\", among others, by having the Prince's beloved governor, his illegitimate uncle, Frederick Nassau de Zuylestein, removed from the Prince's entourage. Apparently, this earned him the enduring enmity of the impressionable boy, who loved the older man dearly. The episode also for the moment put paid to attempts to appoint the Prince to the Raad van State.Israel (1995), pp. 775‚Äì776 Mounting tensions with France Meanwhile, relations with France started to deteriorate, also. Since the days of Henry IV, France had been an important ally of the Republic. In 1635 during the Republic's war with Spain, Cardinal Richelieu, Louis XIII's chief minister, concluded a treaty with the Republic in which the parties agreed to attack the Spanish Netherlands on two fronts in that year. Those provinces were to be granted the status of free Cantons on the Swiss model, if they cooperated, but in case of resistance there was to be a partition of the country in which the French would receive the French-speaking provinces and western Flanders, and the Dutch Antwerp, the Scheldt Estuary, and Ghent, Bruges, and Mechelen. The States Party of the time was not happy with this arrangement, because the reintegration of Antwerp in the Republic would upset the cosy arrangement that kept Antwerp's trade bridled in favor of Amsterdam's. However, this partition treaty was pushed through by stadtholder Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange, and the Orangist regents, many of whom were generously bribed by Richelieu. Nothing much came of these plans. The formidable Spanish Army of Flanders checked the attack by putting up a strategic defense against France, and vigorously attacking the Dutch. The offensive of 1635 almost turned into a disaster for the Dutch, after their invasion was repelled, and the Spaniards successfully counterattacked. The French were too weak to make a large impression.Israel (1995), pp. 526‚Äì529 Though the treaty prohibited conclusion of a separate peace with Spain, the Republic nevertheless concluded such a peace in 1648, leaving France to face Spain alone till the Peace of the Pyrenees in 1659. This caused a decided coolness in the relations between the countries up to the time Louis XIV personally took up the reins in 1661. However, at this time the partition treaty was still formally in force between the two countries, something to be held in reserve in case the need arose. Of course, the Dutch now being on very good terms with the Spanish, did not for a moment intend to join Louis in any designs against the Spanish Netherlands, and such designs were for the moment in abeyance, as Louis had just married Maria Theresa of Spain, the daughter of king Philip IV of Spain, as a guarantee of good relations between France and Spain. One of the conditions of the marriage contract, on which other conditions were contingent, was a large dowry that Spain would pay to France. Philip IV died, however, in 1665 without the dowry having been properly paid. Louis then (declaring the conditions in the marriage treaty in which his wife renounced her rights to the Spanish Crown and its possessions void, because of non-compliance with the dowry condition) construed a claim of his wife on the Duchy of Brabant. The new Spanish government rejected this, but its position was weakened, because its forces were fully committed at the time in the Portuguese Restoration War that was still raging. Its once formidable Army of Flanders had been almost disbanded by this time. The diplomatic unrest around this question disturbed De Witt no end. His initial relations with Louis had been very amicable. In 1662 he renewed the old alliance with France, as we have seen, and this alliance was helpful in the conflict with England and Munster, when the French sent auxiliary troops to help shore up the Dutch eastern defenses in 1665. Except for the Caribbean, France did not take part in the war with England. As a matter of fact the new French West India Company, formed in 1664, took Cayenne by force away from the WIC in 1665, but the Dutch were forced to grin and bear this, because of the ongoing war with England at the time.Israel (1995), p. 779 But the way Louis was acting in the matter of the Spanish Netherlands made De Witt anxious that the old partition treaty should not become operational. It offered a number of equally unpalatable prospects for the Dutch: unwanted incorporation of Antwerp (the blockade of which was now enshrined in the peace treaty of 1648 with Spain) would open up that city's trade; and a resurgent France as an immediate neighbor would necessitate the building up of the standing army, an expense the regents wanted to avoid at all costs. For the moment De Witt rejected Spanish feelers for a defensive alliance against France, even when the Spanish envoy made an unauthorized threat that Spain would abandon the Southern Netherlands to France, in exchange for Roussillon and Navarre. De Witt recognized this as an empty bluff. As France invaded the Spanish Netherlands in 1667, starting the War of Devolution, De Witt started discussions with Spain, however, in hope of deterring France, and staking out a claim in case Spanish resistance would collapse. Spain received a large Dutch loan, with a number of Flemish cities as collateral, and De Witt now pointedly obtained permission to occupy these pawns as a guarantee of repayment.Israel (1995), p. 781 As the French made slow, but inexorable progress, De Witt, though very reluctant to intervene, thought up a solution for his dilemma that would stop the French advance, without necessitating Dutch military intervention, or even (as he hoped) forcing a break with France. He now concluded the Triple Alliance (1668) with England and Sweden. This was an armed coalition of the three countries that forced their mediation on France and Spain. France was to be appeased with all territorial gains it had up to then achieved by military means in the Southern Netherlands (among which the cities of Lille and Cambrai), and Spain was further called upon to cede either Luxembourg, or the Franche-Comt√©. The only thing that was required of Louis was that he halt his advance. This lopsided award was designed to placate Louis, without spoiling the relations with the Republic. The not-so-secret sting in the deal was that the three would intervene militarily if Louis rejected this generous award. Louis therefore complied at the Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668) with the demands of the allies, but he took the humiliation very hard. After this he started to plot with Charles II of England and the prince-bishop of Munster (who had his own revenge needs after 1666) and the Elector of Cologne, Maximilian Henry of Bavaria, who resented Dutch interference with his attempts to subdue the Free City of Cologne. This resulted in a number of secret arrangements, among which the Secret treaty of Dover, designed to start a war of aggression against the Dutch Republic in 1672, and to divide that country among the participants.Israel (1995), pp. 781‚Äì785 Before that hot war started, France and the Republic already became engaged in an economic war, however. France had always been a very important trading partner with the Republic, especially since the 1640s. Sales of Dutch textiles, spices and other colonial wares, herring, whale products, Delftware and Gouda pipes, Baltic naval stores, tobacco products, and refined sugar (for a large part of raw sugar from French-Caribbean plantations) had greatly expanded in France. On the other hand, the Republic was a very large importer of French wine, brandy, salt, silk, paper, vinegar and Breton sail-canvas (often for reexport from its entrepot). In other words, the two economies complemented each other to a large extent (other than the Dutch and English economies, that mainly competed in the same markets). This complementarity would in modern eyes be seen as a happy opportunity for exploiting comparative advantage by specialization, which it indeed became in the years up to the mid-1650s. Unfortunately, in those days trade was seen as a zero-sum game (also by the Dutch incidentally); both parties suspected being exploited by the other.Israel (1995), pp. 779, 784‚Äì785; Israel (1989), pp. 261, 285 Jean-Baptiste Colbert in 1666, by Philippe de Champaigne Not being an economist, Louis resented the preponderant share in the French market, taken by the Dutch, on basically emotional grounds, but his new Superintendent of Finances, Jean-Baptiste Colbert, gave focused impetus to this resentment by a well-organised complex of economic policies, of a mercantilist nature. The first of these was his tariff list of 1664, which was calculated to just wrest away important French markets from the Dutch, without completely closing down trade (except for the trade in refined sugar, which was hit with a prohibitive tariff). However, in 1667 this was followed with a much more draconian list that doubled tariffs on Dutch fine cloth, linen, and Delftware; quadrupled them on whale products (for which France was Holland's biggest customer); and raised them sevenfold for tobacco products.Israel (1989), p. 287 Another measure, directed directly at the Dutch trade system outside the direct Franco-Dutch relations, was the founding of a number of chartered trading companies that were intended to compete with the Dutch VOC and WIC, but also make inroads on the Dutch Baltic trade, like the already mentioned West India Company and the French East India Company, both formed in 1664, and given monopolies in France. These caused the Dutch some anxiety, but proved eventually not very successful. The same applied to the Compagnie du Nord that Colbert set up in 1669 to compete with the Dutch in Scandinavia. This was supposed to engross the Dutch salt trade with especially Norway, and replace it with French salt. Unfortunately, the French salt with a high magnesium content proved unfit for preserving herring (as the Dutch could have told Colbert, because they had tried to sell it to the Norwegians themselves, when the Iberian salt trade was closed to them). France therefore had to subsidise these exports, and also the otherwise uncompetitive French shipping rates. Despite government pressure the Bordeaux wine merchants were unwilling to shift their exports away from Dutch carriers, or do without Dutch prefinancing of their operations. The unprofitability of its operations, combined with Dutch dumping policies in the trade of Baltic naval stores, forced the winding up of the company in 1675.Israel (1989), pp. 223‚Äì224, 284‚Äì287 Nevertheless, thanks to the importance of the French market to the Dutch, and the fact that the Dutch had less possibilities of imposing counter- pressure than they had in their conflicts with the English, the Dutch government at first tried to ignore the hostile policies of Colbert. Its inaction was also caused by differences of opinion about how best to proceed within the States Party. Amsterdam, and especially the Amsterdam diplomat Coenraad van Beuningen, argued in favor of firm economic counter-measures against the French economic policies, paired with the forming of a defensive alliance with Spain and the Holy Roman Empire. De Witt, however, preferred avoiding such foreign entanglements, and a conciliatory approach in the economic sphere. As their economic interests were severely damaged by the French protectionism, the industrial cities of Leiden and Haarlem, however, teamed up with Amsterdam to support a more belligerent diplomacy. After the Rotterdam regents were promised compensation for the damage to their wine trade, to get their assent, the States of Holland decided in 1671 on severe retaliatory measures against French imports, in effect banning French wine, vinegar, paper, and sail-canvas.Israel (1995), pp. 781‚Äì783, 785 The stage was now set for war. The end of the De-Witt regime The war started in March, 1672. An English fleet attacked the Dutch Smyrna convoy in the Channel, as in the previous two conflictsIsrael (1995), pp. 715, 766 without a declaration of war. That was to follow only after France had declared war on April 6. The French army was the largest in Europe at the time. Louis assembled 118,000 infantry and 12,500 cavalry against a regular Dutch army that numbered at most 30,000. That Dutch army, long neglected by the De-Witt regime, was also qualitatively inferior. The regents belatedly tried to reinforce it with contingents of the citizen militias, but it was all too little, too late. The Dutch enclaves in present-day Germany, Cleves and Lingen, were quickly overrun by the Elector of Cologne, the Munsterites, and the French, a long list of venerable fortresses being taken almost without a shot fired. Then the French stormed across the Rhine at Lobith on June 12, outflanking the main Dutch eastern line of defense at the IJssel. The Dutch now hastily retreated to the Hollandse Waterlinie, thereby abandoning all but the provinces of Holland, Zeeland, and Utrecht to the enemy. The French followed at their leisure, experiencing little resistance, as the citizens of first Arnhem, and then Utrecht rioted, and forced their city governments to capitulate without a fight.Israel (1995), pp. 796‚Äì798 But there the advance halted. The waterline defense was filling up, despite the summer drought, inundating vast tracts of land across the path of the advancing French, which effectively blocked them. Louis did not mind, as he expected the Dutch to know they were beaten, allowing him to await their peace offers in his headquarters in Utrecht. He did not have long to wait. The Dutch government was in a complete funk. Defeatism among the regents was rife. Against the advice of De Witt, the States of Holland already before the fall of Utrecht on June 23, had sent the Rotterdam Pensionary, Pieter de Groot (the son of Grotius) to parley with the king's envoys Louvois and Pomponne. He returned to the Hague with the bleak message that capitulation was the only option. The States concurred, hoping to save the Republic proper, and the free exercise of the Reformed religion (Louis had already had the Utrecht cathedral reconsecrated to Catholic worship), but being prepared to sign away the Generality Lands.Israel (1995), pp. 798‚Äì799 But now the remarkable popular insurrection began that would save the Republic, and overturn the States-Party regime. Protests began in De Witt's hometown, Dordrecht, and soon spread to Rotterdam, Schiedam, Leiden and Amsterdam. In Rotterdam and Amsterdam the militias forced the vroedschap to vote against the capitulation. Nevertheless, on June 26 the States General voted four to three (Holland, and the three already occupied provinces Utrecht, Gelderland and Overijssel, against the rest) to send De Groot with a mandate to sign away the Generality Lands and offer a large war indemnity to Louis. Louis thought the offer insufficient, and sent De Groot back empty- handed. It was the last offer he would get.Israel (1995), p. 800 To understand what happened next we have to digress about the position of the Prince of Orange. During the war with England, and the Buat Conspiracy, the Orangists had to lie low, as we have seen. However, under the gathering clouds of the conflict with France, and because the Prince finally got to the age where he could plausibly be proposed for actual public office in his own right (his cousin Willem Frederick died in 1664, taking the cadet branch of the family temporarily out of the running as the Frisian stadtholdership was now taken by an infant). The pressure on De Witt to allow a role for William therefore started to mount inexorably, putting him on the defensive. However, he celebrated one final triumph of the \\"True Freedom\\", when in 1667 he managed to engineer the final abolition of the stadtholderate, not only in Holland, but also in Utrecht, Gelderland and Overijssel. These provinces signed the so- called Perpetual Edict (1667) which abolished the office of stadtholder in these provinces \\"forever\\" (the Act of Seclusion had only stated that no Prince of Orange could hold that office), separating the captaincy-general of the Union from the stadtholderate of any of the provinces (to close the door to the Frisian stadtholder), and transferring the functions of the stadtholder permanently to the States in Holland.Israel (1995), pp. 791‚Äì792 The triumph was short-lived, and somewhat pyrrhic, however. It actually made the elevation of William to the office of captain-general in February, 1672, more difficult to deflect, as the danger of a combination of the functions of stadtholder and commander-in-chief no longer threatened. The 21-year-old Prince was therefore duly given the command of the army (with De Witt's grudging assent), just before the war started, making him share in the responsibility for the military debacle, which he, of course, in the circumstances could not avoid. De Witt hoped to control him with the deputies-in-the-field, an institution that Marlborough would come heartily to detest when he in turn was appointed lieutenant-captain-general of the Union in 1702.Israel (1995), p. 794 But circumstances now allowed him to wrest free from political control. At first the Prince was swept along in the political turmoil. As head of the federal army he felt a responsibility to maintain public order where it had broken down, often because the city militias had come out against the city governments. An interesting political development started to take shape, in which the Orangist mob (against which normally both the States Party and the Orangist regents would have formed a common front) injected a decidedly \\"democratic\\" element into Dutch politics. The mob, incited by the Calvinist preachers as usual, demanded not only a purge of the States Party regents, but also an alteration of detested policies, like toleration of dissenting Protestants. The main demand, of course, was the abolition of the Perpetual Edict, and the appointment of William to the restored stadtholdership. He was therefore, in effect, put in power by the people in July, 1672. The Orangist regents (hoping this would be a one-off aberration) legitimized this \\"unconstitutional\\" interference of the common people in what they, too, considered \\"their\\" affairs, after the fact as a \\"patriotic\\" and necessary check on regent presumption, which was justified by the emergency. It is nevertheless remarkable, and somewhat ironic, that now Orangist ideology also had a \\"democratic\\" variant.Israel (1995), p. 802 William was appointed stadtholder of Zeeland on July 2; the States of Holland followed suit the next day. Of course, the old prerogatives of the stadtholder, like appointing the city governments, even in the voting cities, abolished in December, 1650, were also restored. At first William did not move against the States Party, but the mob unrest continued apace, despite the fact that the Orangist demand had been met. In city after city the States Party regents were now molested. Rotterdam Pensionary De Groot, the would-be signer of the capitulation, had to flee to Antwerp. In Amsterdam the transfer of power had an orderly character, but elsewhere violence was used. In Rotterdam the militia forced the vroedschap to oust the remaining States Party regents, as in Dordrecht.Israel (1995), pp. 802‚Äì803 The bodies of the brothers De Witt, by Jan de Baen. In the Hague events took a particularly ugly turn. De Witt was severely wounded by a knife- wielding assassin on June 21. He resigned as Grand Pensionary on August 4, but this was not enough for his enemies. His brother Cornelis (De Ruyter's deputy- in-the-field at the Raid on the Medway), particularly hated by the Orangists, was arrested on trumped up charges of treason. He was tortured (as was usual under the Roman-Dutch system of law, that required a confession before a conviction was possible) but refused to confess. Nevertheless, he was sentenced to exile. When his brother went over to the jail (which was only a few steps from his house) to help him get started on his journey, both were attacked by members of the Hague civic militia in a clearly orchestrated assassination. The brothers were shot and then left to the mob. Their naked, mutilated bodies were strung up on the nearby public gibbet, while the Orangist mob partook of their roasted livers in a cannibalistic frenzy. Throughout it all, a remarkable discipline was maintained by the mob, according to contemporary observers, making one doubt the spontaneity of the event.Israel (1995), p. 803 Thus ended the life of Johan de Witt, who had in effect ruled the Republic for almost twenty years. His regime outlasted him only a few more days. Though no more people were killed, the lynching of De Witts lent renewed impetus to the mob attacks, and to help restore public order the States of Holland empowered William on August 27 to purge the city councils in any way he would see fit to restore public order. The following purges in the early days of September were accompanied by large, but peaceful, Orangist demonstrations, that had a remarkable political character. The demonstrations delivered petitions that demanded certain additional reforms with a, in a sense, \\"reactionary\\" flavor: the \\"ancient\\" privileges of the guilds and civic militias (who were traditionally seen as mouthpieces of the citizenry as a whole) to curb the regent's powers were to be recognized again (as in pre-Burgundian times). The demonstrators also demanded more influence of the Calvinist preachers on the content of government policies and a roll- back of the toleration of Catholics and other dissenting denominations. The purges of the city governments were not everywhere equally thoroughgoing (and, of course, there was little mention of popular influence later on, as the new regents shared the abhorrence of the old ones of real democratic reforms). But as a whole, the new Orangist regime of the Stadtholder was well-entrenched during his following reign.Israel (1995), pp. 804‚Äì806 Aftermath The question whether William had a hand in the murder of the De-Witt brothers will always remain unanswered, like his exact role in the later Massacre of Glencoe. The fact that he ordered the withdrawal of a federal cavalry detachment, that otherwise might have prevented the lynching, has always raised eyebrows, however, like the fact that he did not prosecute the well- known ringleaders like Cornelis Tromp and his relative, Johan Kievit, the Buat conspirator, who now was appointed pensionary of Rotterdam, and even advanced their careers. But maybe firm measures against the conspirators were not feasible in the political climate of those fraught days in the Fall of 1672. Stadtholder William III of Orange, by Peter Lely In any case, the political turmoil did not enable the allies an opportunity to finish the Republic off. The French were effectively stymied by the water defenses. Only when the inundations froze over in the following winter was there, briefly, a chance for Marshal Luxembourg, who had taken over command of the invading army from Louis, to make an incursion with 10,000 troops on skates. This almost ended in disaster, when they were ambushed. Meanwhile, the States General managed to conclude alliances with the German emperor and Brandenburg, which helped relieve the French pressure in the East.Israel (1995), p. 812 The war at sea went badly from the start for the allies because of the genius of Lieutenant- Admiral De Ruyter, whose exploits at this time earned him the admiration of admiral Alfred Thayer Mahan who in his seminal work The Influence of Sea Power Upon History, 1660‚Äì1783 points out the tactical advantage the Dutch admiral derived from the \\"local terrain\\" (if one may speak of \\"terrain\\" at sea) when battling the combined Anglo-French fleets in the shallow waters off the Dutch coast, and later his strategic use of the \\"fleet-in-being\\" to checkmate the numerically superior allied fleets. (1918) The Influence of Sea Power Upon History, 1660‚Äì1783, p. 144 ff De Ruyter's successes, both defensively and offensively, combined with the successes of other Dutch admirals (New York was retaken by a Zeeland fleet, for instance) and Dutch privateers, again severely damaged English commerce. After Parliament refused to vote him a war budget in 1674, threatening a repeat of 1667, Charles was driven from the war thanks to Spanish mediation. The Peace of Westminster was a condition of the Spanish to enter the war against France on the Dutch side, because they did not want to fight both England and France simultaneously. The Dutch were therefore compelled to relinquish New York again. The peace brought England no net gains at all, however. Hopes of territorial gains in the Netherlands proper, that Charles had entertained before the war, were dashed. The Dutch did, however, replace the subsidies from Louis that the latter now no longer paid. Those had been a waste of money, anyway.Israel (1995), pp. 812‚Äì813 Soon after, France's German allies were driven from the war, in an equally humiliating way. Dutch troops reconquered all lands lost to Munster. A strategic thrust to the fortress of Bonn in late 1673 forced the French to evacuate the areas she occupied in the Republic, except for Maastricht and Grave. By then the reconstituted Dutch army had again become a formidable force, as in the 1640s, its strength rising to 100,000 men, almost as large as the French army (France had a population ten times as large in these days as that of the Republic). This was accomplished by great financial outlay in the hiring of mercenary troops. But the Republic had the financial wherewithal to bear this burden, despite French hopes that it would break the Republic. The war went on till the Peace of Nijmegen in 1678. Here the Dutch finally obtained the retraction of Colbert's tariff of 1667, that had set off the economic war. However, the handling of the peace negotiations, in which Louis managed to divide his enemies, and entice the Dutch (against the wishes of William, who perceived the diplomatic cost) to conclude a separate peace, cost the Republic dearly in reputation and good will with its allies.Israel (1995), pp. 813, 824‚Äì825 The Peace solved nothing. Louis continued his aggressive policies for the rest of his life, and William spent the rest of his life as the great frustrator of Louis' ambitions. This led to the epic conflicts between France and its allies on the one hand, and the Republic and its allies on the other, around the turn of the 18th century. England was brought into the Dutch camp by the preventive invasion (brought about by Dutch fears of a repeat of the combined Anglo- French attack of 1672) of 1688, later known as the Glorious Revolution. This brought William to the English throne, which, with its greater population and resources, became William's new political and economic focus in pursuing his wars against Louis XIV. The Dutch Republic became the junior party in this union with England, as bankers and entrepreneurs moved with William to London, taking the innovations that had enabled Dutch preeminence in the prior decades with them. London became the new center of commerce, at the expense of the Dutch cities. Thus, while the Glorious Revolution appeared at first as the ultimate triumph of the Dutch over their English adversaries, it turned into their kiss of death. When William died on the eve of the War of Spanish Succession in 1702, the regents that had been his faithful ministers in the Republic immediately reverted to De Witt's \\"True Freedom\\", refusing to appoint the Frisian stadtholder John William Friso, Prince of Orange (designated as his heir in his will) stadtholder in the other provinces, despite the fact that the stadtholderate had been declared hereditary in Holland in 1674.

The sisters' convent is located in Beaverton. The Sisters provide lifelong learning opportunities through Bethany Center, which offers programs and lectures. The Sisters also offer GED and ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages) classes. The Sisters are a U.S. legal corporation separate from the Archdiocese of Portland. The Sisters' sponsored ministries include Valley Catholic School and Maryville. The Sisters of St. Mary of Oregon Ministries Corporation and the Sisters of St. Mary of Oregon Foundation provide administrative and developmental support to the sponsored ministries. History The complex in 1906  Founding  In 1843 the Missionaries of the Precious Blood migrated from Germany to the United States, settling in Ohio. They were soon joined by the Sisters of the Precious Blood. In 1866, a dispute occurred within the Precious Blood community. As a result, Father Joseph Albrecht (along with a group of parishioners, Sisters, and Brothers), left the community. The group traveled to Minnesota, then (following Father Albrecht's death) to Jordan, Oregon. By 1885 members of this schismatic religious colony began to question the decisions of the new leadership. As a result, nine women left the community and were invited to stay with the Benedictines of Mount Angel Abbey. Archbishop William Hickley Gross visited the colony and laid out a plan for reconciliation with the Catholic Church. The group's elders rejected the plan, but the women asked to come along with the bishop, who wanted them to become a formal religious community. After several months of living with the Catholic institute of the Benedictine Sisters of Mt. Angel at the Queen of Angels Monastery, the Sisters refounded their order, moved to Sublimity, and began their new life as the Sisters of the Most Precious Blood. They changed their name to Sisters of St. Mary of Oregon in 1905. On March 25, 1887, five of the Sisters made their first Profession of Vows: Theresa Arnold, Emma Bleily, Cecilia Boedigheimer, Josephine Eifert, and Clara Hauck. Emma Bleily took the name Wilhelmina in honor of Archbishop William Gross. She was elected as the first Mother General of the community at the age of 29, and became known as Mother Wilhelmina Bleily.  St. Mary's Orphanage  In 1889, Archbishop Gross approved construction of St. Mary's Orphanage in Beaverton, Oregon and asked the Sisters to staff it. By June 1891, three Sisters were serving in Sublimity, three were serving in Verboort, Oregon, and all of the other Sisters had moved to Beaverton. The Sisters lived at the orphanage where they cared for sixty children, tended to the building, and harvested crops. Mother Seraphim Theisen the community's second Mother General, built a home nearby which became the community's first Motherhouse. On January 18, 1894, Archbishop Gross dedicated the Motherhouse to Our Lady of Perpetual Help. Presently, the Sisters reside in a new Motherhouse, across the street from the original building. The orphanage was run by the Sisters until June 16, 1953. It is now run by the state of Oregon and has been renamed to St. Mary's Home for Boys.  Early Twentieth Century  In 1901, under Mother Theresa Heuberger, the Community adopted English as its official language (up until this point the community had used German as its primary language). In January 1903, the Sisters opened a boarding school on their campus which served both boys and girls: St. Mary's Academy. On August 12, 1905, Archbishop Alexander Christie asked the Sisters to approve three significant changes: # He requested that they rename their boarding school so that it would not be confused with St. Mary's Academy in downtown Portland. The boarding school became St. Mary's Institute. # Since there was another Precious Blood community in Portland, he requested they change the name of their community as well. They became the Sisters of St. Mary of Oregon. # As Sisters of the Precious Blood, they had worn red cinctures (belts). With their new name change, the Archbishop asked them to wear black cintures instead. They agreed. The Sisters expanded their complex, adding both an east and west wing to the Motherhouse (in 1902 and 1905 respectively), and purchasing nearby property. In 1930, the Sisters began construction on the nearby property, constructing what is now their present Motherhouse. The first phase of the Motherhouse included the main building and west wing. The Sister took up residence there on September 22, 1930. It was another six years before their chapel was complete. It was dedicated to Our Lady of Perpetual Helpon March 19, 1936. It would be more than a decade before the west wing would be added in the early 1950s. References Further reading * Schoenberg, Wilfred P., S. J.

It took place in Torrington, Devon. Prelude After Lord Wentworth's defeat at Bovey Tracey, Sir Ralph Hopton was appointed Royalist commander in the west, with Wentworth commanding the horse and Sir Richard Grenville the foot. Grenville refused to recognise Hopton's command and was arrested for insubordination and imprisoned on St Michael's Mount. Hopton's army, numbering 3,000 horse and 2,000 foot, advanced into Devon and occupied Torrington, where defensive works were erected. Battle The Parliamentarians approached from the east on the evening of 16 February 1646. In heavy rain and with night falling, the Parliamentarians ran into Royalist dragoons and fighting broke out to the east of Torrington. The Parliamentarian commander, Sir Thomas Fairfax, decided to wait until morning to reconnoitre the Royalists' defences. However, when he sent his dragoons forward to test the defences and they came under fire; Fairfax pushed more troops forward in support and a general fight developed. The fighting at the barricades lasted two hours at push of pike. At last the Cornish infantry gave way and retreated into the town, where bitter fighting continued. A stray spark ignited the Royalist magazine in Torrington church, where eighty barrels of gunpowder were stored. The explosion destroyed the church, killed all the prisoners held there and narrowly missed killing Fairfax. Aftermath The explosion effectively ended the battle with the remaining Royalist troops escaping. Memorial The anniversary of the battle is remembered in February each year, with a torch-lit procession and re-enactment. In fiction The battle features strongly in the conclusion of Rosemary Sutcliff's historical fiction Simon.

Biography Cover of the Dutch League of Vegetarian's magazine Vegetarische Bode, founded in September 1894. He was the grandson of Willem de Clercq and grew up in Haarlem where he became good friends with Frederik van Eeden at the HBS high school there. After continuing his education by studying technology in Delft and chemistry in Berlin he settled in Leiden, but in 1878 he returned to Haarlem to become the technical director of a paint factory there, where he lived the rest of his life. For this factory he introduced several labor reforms which he then tried to scale to the rest of Haarlem and later as a member of the socialist labor party, to the rest of the country. His first act was to create a room for workers to eat their meals; a \\"schaftlokaal\\" or cafeteria. He next instituted health insurance and accident insurance for his employees along the lines of Bismarck's Health Insurance Bill of 1883 and Accident Insurance Bill of 1884. He expressed the need for secondary school for the future workers of his factory and wished to create a training school connected to his factory. These extra expenses were not popular with his employer however and de Clercq quit his job in 1890. In 1891, he began the Haarlem society called De Ambachtsschool to unify various city efforts to start the first vocational school in Haarlem.Deugd boven geweld, Een geschiedenis van Haarlem, 1245-1995, edited by Gineke van der Ree-Scholtens, 1995, , p555 He also became a member of the Haarlem Debating society where he advocated his views on housing and education reform for the working class in Haarlem. In 1883 he joined the Amsterdam freethought society De Dageraad. He propagated land nationalisation whereby he combined the \\"gardencity\\" ideas of Ebenezer Howard with the socialist ideas of Domela Nieuwenhuis who he knew through \\"De Dageraad\\". He believed that by nationalizing the land and creating freestanding homes for everyone, more workers would have more energy for society due to better health. These ideas were popular among workers and reformers alike. He organized meetings where the painter-reformer Herman Heijenbrock and the writer-reformer Frederik van Eeden could air their social ideas. He became an activist for vegetarianism. In 1894 he joined the newly formed NVB, the Dutch Vegetarian Society () and became editor of its magazine \\"Vegetarische Bode\\" in 1897. In 1898 he succeeded Felix Ortt as chairman of the group and remained chairman until 1907. He published numerous brochures and articles and was a popular guest speaker for reformist groups. He was also candidate of the SDAP (Dutch socialist party).

Historical Minorities in the Kingdom of Poland and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth Although the concept of an ethnic minority is mostly used with regards to modern period, historically, Poland has been a very multi-ethnic country. Early on, the influx of Czech, Hungarian, Slovak, Jewish, and German settlers was particularly notable, forming significant minorities, or even majorities in urban centers. After the Polish-Lithuanian union of mid-14th century and the Union of Lublin formally establishing the Commonwealth in 1569, Lithuanians and Ruthenians constituted a major part of the Commonwealth populace. An estimate for 1493 gives the combined population of Poland and Lithuania at 7.5 million, breaking them down by ethnicity at *3.25 million Poles *3.75 million Ruthenians (modern day Ukrainians and Belarusians) *0.5 million Lithuanians In 1618, after the Truce of Deulino the population of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth increased together with its territory, reaching 12 million. Its inhabitants could be roughly divided into: *Poles - 4.5 million *Ukrainians - 3.5 million *Belarusians - 1.5 million *Lithuanians - 0.75 million *Prussians - 0.75 million *Jews - 0.5 million *Livonians - 0.5 million At that time the szlachta, or Polish nobility, formed 10% and burghers, 15%. With the population and territorial losses of the mid and late-17th century, in 1717 the population of the Commonwealth had declined to only 9 million, which breaks down into the following ethnic groups: *4.5 million Poles *1.5 million Ukrainians *1.2 million Belarusians *0.8 million Lithuanians *0.5 million Jews *0.5 million others Minorities in the Second Republic Poland, linguistic 1937 Language of instruction in interwar Polish schools and percent of population listing a particular language as \\"mother tongue\\", 1937/38. Click to enlarge. The census of 1921 allocates 30.8% of the population in the minority. This was further exacerbated with the Polish victory in the Polish-Soviet War, and the large territorial gains in the east, made by Poland as a consequence. According to the 1931 Polish Census (as cited by Norman Davies), 68.9% of the population was Polish, 13.9% were Ukrainians, around 10% Jewish, 3.1% Belarusians, 2.3% Germans and 2.8% - others, including Lithuanians, Czechs and Armenians. Also, there were smaller communities of Russians, and Gypsies. The situation of minorities was a complex subject and changed during the period. Poland was also a nation of many religions. In 1921, 16,057,229 Poles (approx. 62.5%) were Roman (Latin) Catholics, 3,031,057 citizens of Poland (approx. 11.8%) were Eastern Rite Catholics (mostly Ukrainian Greek Catholics and Armenian Rite Catholics), 2,815,817 (approx. 10.95%) were Greek Orthodox, 2,771,949 (approx. 10.8%) were Jewish, and 940,232 (approx. 3.7%) were Protestants (mostly Lutheran). By 1931 Poland had the second largest Jewish population in the world, with one-fifth of all the world's Jews residing within its borders (approx. 3,136,000). Modern Minorities during the People's Republic Before World War II, a third of Poland's population was composed of ethnic minorities. After the war, however, Poland's minorities were mostly gone, due to the 1945 revision of borders, and the Holocaust. Under the National Repatriation Office (Pa≈Ñstwowy UrzƒÖd Repatriacyjny), millions of Poles were forced to leave their homes in the eastern Kresy region and settle in the western former German territories. At the same time approximately 5 million remaining Germans (about 8 million had already fled or had been expelled and about 1 million had been killed in 1944-46) were similarly expelled from those territories into the Allied occupation zones. Ukrainian and Belarusian minorities found themselves now mostly within the borders of the Soviet Union; those who opposed this new policy (like the Ukrainian Insurgent Army in the Bieszczady Mountains region) were suppressed by the end of 1947 in the Operation Vistula. The population of Jews in Poland, which formed the largest Jewish community in pre-war Europe at about 3.3 million people, was almost completely destroyed by 1945. Approximately 3 million Jews died of starvation in ghettos and labor camps, were slaughtered at the German Nazi extermination camps or by the Einsatzgruppen death squads. Between 40,000 and 100,000 Polish Jews survived the Holocaust in Poland, and another 50,000 to 170,000 were repatriated from the Soviet Union, and 20,000 to 40,000 from Germany and other countries. At its postwar peak, there were 180,000 to 240,000 Jews in Poland, settled mostly in Warsaw, ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Krak√≥w and Wroc≈Çaw. Minority rights in the Third Republic The rights of ethnic minorities in Poland are guaranteed in article 35 of the 1997 Constitution: :1. The Republic of Poland shall ensure Polish citizens belonging to national or ethnic minorities the freedom to maintain and develop their own language, to maintain customs and traditions, and to develop their own culture. :2. National and ethnic minorities shall have the right to establish educational and cultural institutions, institutions designed to protect religious identity, as well as to participate in the resolution of matters connected with their cultural identity. The Bill on Ethnic and National Minorities and Regional Languages of 6 January 2005 () stipulates that in order to be recognized as an ethnic or national minority a given group must reside in Poland for at least 100 years, which excludes minorities previously recognized as such under the Communist regimes, such as the Greeks. There are presently three categories of recognized minorities in Poland: 9 national minorities (Belorussians, Czechs, Lithuanians, Germans, Armenians, Russians, Slovaks, Ukrainians, Jews), 4 ethnic minorities (Karaites, Lemkos, Roma and Tatars), and a regional linguistic minority (Kashubians). Poland has ratified the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages on 12 February 2009: #minorities languages: Belorussian, Czech, Hebrew, Yiddish, Karaim, Kashub, Lithuanian, Lemko, German, Armenian, Romani, Russian, Slovak, Tatar and Ukrainian. #regional language: Kashub language #national minorities languages: Belorussian, Czech, Hebrew, Yiddish, Lithuanian, German, Armenian, Russian, Slovak and Ukrainian #ethnic minorities languages: Karaim, Lemko, Romani and Tatar #non-territorial languages: Hebrew, Yiddish, Karaim, Armenian and Romani. Demography At the Polish census of 2002, 96.7% of the people of Poland claimed Polish nationality, and 97.8% declare that they speak Polish at home. At the 2011 census, 1.44% of the 39 million inhabitants of Poland declared to be descendants of another single ancestry than Polish. That number includes 418,000 who declared to be Silesians as a national-ethnic identification (362,000 as single ethnicity and 391,000 a second ethnicity) and 17,000 Kashubians (16,000 as single ethnicity). Recognized minorities numbered 0.3% of the population: 49,000 Germans (26,000 single ethnicity), 36,000 Ukrainians (26,000 single ethnicity), 7,000 Lemkos (5,000 single ethnicity), 37,000 Belarusians (31,000 single ethnicity), 12,000 Roma people (9,000 single ethnicity), 8,000 Russians (5,000 single ethnicity). 0.2% of the population are foreign citizens. 2002 census: *38,230,080 - Total population of Poland *36,983,720 - Polish *774,885 - Nationality not specified *471,475 - Non-Polish, or multi-ethnic Polish census of 2011: *38,512,000 - Total population of Poland *36,157,000 - Only Polish ethnicity *951,000 - Nationality not specified *1,404,000 declared non-Polish ethnicity either as a first or as a second one; 842,000 of them declared non-Polish ethnicity together with Polish one (52% of Silesians, 93% of Kashubians, 46% of Germans, 40% of Ukrainians); 640,000 declared non-Polish nationality as a first one (562,000 declared only non-Polish ethnicity); 802,000 declared non-Polish enthonationality as a second one (50% Silesian, 26% Kashubian, 8% German). Armenians Around 50,000 Armenians settled in Poland in the 14th century, and an Armenian colony gradually formed through successive immigrations. According to the Polish census of 2002, there are 1,082 Armenians in Poland, although Armenian-oriented sources cite estimates as high as 92,000. The Armenian-Orthodox community converted to Catholicism in the 17th century. There is still an Armenian church in formerly Polish Lw√≥w (now Lviv in Ukraine) with clergy that preach in the Armenian language. The remains of pre- war Armenian church organizations serve the community.  Bangladeshis  Belarusians In the Polish census of 2002, 48,700 people declared they belong to this group. This number fell to 46,800 in the 2011 census. They live in close concentrations on south and east area of Bia≈Çystok, near and in areas adjoining Belarus border. Czechs According to the Polish census of 2002, 386 Czechs live in Poland, many of them in Zel√≥w or near the Czech border, such as in the Czech Corner. Arguably, the most famous Pole with Czech roots is painter Jan Matejko. Germans Germans remain in Silesia, Pomerania, Warmia-Masuria and Lubusz Land. The current estimates based on the 2002 census gives 147 094 Germans living mainly in the region of Opole, Katowice and Czƒôstochowa (south-west part of Poland). Germans first came to Silesia during the Late Middle Ages. and were mass-expelled from regions of today's Poland which were part of the German-speaking lands for centuries. Gorals Polish Gorals are an ethnographic group in southern Poland that speaks a dialect of Polish that has been heavily influenced by Slovak. Some urban Poles find this very distinct dialect difficult to understand. Polish Gorals live primarily in the region of Podhale and are separated from Slovak Gorals by the High Tatra mountains, which, together with Zakopane Style architecture, form an important part of Goral identity and are part the reason why the town of Zakopane is now a popular tourist destination and winter resort town. Goralenvolk action, which was an attempt by Nazi Germany during the second world war to Germanize Polish Gorals, failed due to lack of support from the Goral population. Greeks Some 4 - 5,000 Greeks live in central and southeast Poland, most of whom came in 1949, after the Greek Civil War. It is estimated that after this conflict, some 14,000 Greeks came to Poland, settling mainly in the town of Zgorzelec in Lower Silesia. In the course of the time, most of them returned to their homeland or moved to Germany. According to the 2011 census, there are 3600 individuals claim some form of Greek identity living in Poland. Among famous Poles of Greek origin are popular pop singer Eleni Tzoka, drummer Milo Kurtis (who played in such bands as Maanam and Voo Voo), and guitar virtuoso Apostolis Anthimos from the progressive rock band SBB. Jews For many centuries, Poland had the largest population of Jews worldwide, and Jews constituted Poland's first minority group. However, the community did not survive World War II. Before the war, there were 3,474,000 Jews in Poland. Those who managed to escape mostly fled to the United States, Israel, Great Britain or Latin America. According to the Polish Ministry of the Interior and Administration, at the time of the 2002 census, there were 1,055 Jewish people in Poland. In the 2011 census, however, that had grown to 7,353. They mainly live mainly in large cities like Warsaw, Wroc≈Çaw, Krak√≥w and Lublin. Karaims / Karaites  At the 2002 census, there were 45 Karaims, 43 of them Polish citizens. Kashubians In the Polish census of 2002, only 5,100 people declared Kashubian ethnicity, although 52,665 declared Kashubian as their native language. In ten municipalities (gmina), more than 20% of the population spoke Kashubian according to the same census data: Przodkowo (49.0%), Sulƒôczyno (48.6%), Stƒô≈ºyca (43.2%), Sierakowice (39.9%), Linia (35.5%), Chmielno (34.8%), Puck (30.9%), Somonino (30.8%), Szemud (26.3%) and Parchowo (22.6%). At the 2011 census however, the number of persons declaring \\"Kashubian\\" as their first single ethnicity raised to 17,000, and 229,000 including those who declared Kashubian as first or second ethnicity. Donald Tusk, the former Polish Prime Minister, is Kashubian. Kursenieki Curonian-populated area in 1649 While today the Kursenieki, also known as Kuronowie Pruscy and Kuro≈Ñczycy in Polish and Kur≈°ininkai in Lithuanian are a nearly extinct Baltic ethnic group living along the Curonian Spit, in 1649 Kur≈°ininkai settlement spanned from Memel (Klaipƒóda) to Danzig (Gda≈Ñsk). The Kur≈°ininkai were eventually assimilated by the Germans, except along the Curonian Spit where some still live. The Kur≈°ininkai were considered Latvians until after World War I when Latvia gained independence from the Russian Empire, a consideration based on linguistic arguments. This was the rationale for Latvian claims over the Curonian Spit, Memel, and other territories of East Prussia which would be later dropped. Lemkos / Rusyns At the 2002 census there were 5,863 persons (5,850 Polish citizens who declared themselves Lemkos, and 62 Rusyns) all Polish citizens. At the 2011 census, there were 7,000 Lemkos (first declared ethnicity) and 10,000 including those who declared Lemko as second ethnicity. Lithuanians There were 5,846 Lithuanians in Poland (5,639 Polish citizens), according to the 2002 census. They live in close concentrations, in Suwa≈Çki in the north-east of Poland, and in the territory of Pu≈Ñsk Municipality (Gmina) where they constituted 74.4% of the inhabitants in 2002 (3,312 out of 4,454). Macedonians There were 286 Macedonians in Poland at the 2002 census, including 187 Polish citizens. There is a mention of 5,000 Macedonian speakers in 1970. Masurians At the 2002 census, there were 46 self-declared Masurians, all Polish citizens.  Olƒôdrzy / Frisians At the 2002 census, there were 109 self-declared Frisians, including 36 Polish citizens. Gypsies There are 12,731 Romani in Poland, according to the 2002 census. They are dispersed and live across the whole country, although they're more numerous in the south of Poland. Russians Russians are scattered around the territory of Poland but mostly reside in eastern Poland. There are 3244 Russians in Poland, according to the 2002 census. The HFHR estimated around 13,000-15,000 Russians are in Poland. This society includes also Old Believers who are members of the Eastern Old Believers' Church and account for 2,000‚Äì3,000 persons living in the north-east of Poland. Scots Scottish people migrated to Poland in large numbers in the mid-16th century. Mostly from the Highlands of Scotland, and mainly Catholic and Episcopalian, they were fleeing from religious persecution and harsh economic conditions. There was also an extensive trade between Scotland's east coast ports such as Dundee, Leith and Aberdeen and towns such as Danzig (Gda≈Ñsk) and K√∂nigsberg (modern Kaliningrad).A Fischer, The Scots in Germany, 1902, John Donald reprint 1973. William Lithgow, who visited Poland in 1616, reported that there were an estimated 30,000 Scottish families living in the country, which he described as \\"...a mother and nurse for the youth and younglings of Scotland...in cloathing, feeding, and inrichening them\\".M Lynch, Scotland, A New History, Pimlico, London 2000 Many came from Dundee and Aberdeen and could be found in towns on the banks of the Vistula as far south as Krak√≥w. To this day it is believed that many Poles have Scottish ancestry. At the 2011 census, there were 26 Scots (including 13 Polish citizens). Silesians INTERREG estimated there are up to 2,000,000 Silesians in Poland. In the Polish census of 2002, however, 173,153 people officially declared Silesian ethnicity, although only about 60,000 declared Silesian as their native language. In the 2011 Polish census, Silesian ethnicity was declared by 809 thousand responders out of 5 million in the region, including 362 thousand who declared it as their only ethnicity, 418 thousand who declared it as their first ethnicity, and 415 thousand who declared it jointly with a Polish ethnicity. Slovaks Slovaks live in some areas in southern Poland, to the number of 1710 according to the Polish 2002 census. Polish Slovaks inhabit two small frontier regions in the Spisz and Orawa (south of Poland, near Polish-Slovak border). Larger groups of Slovaks are in Krak√≥w and Silesia region. Tatars Small populations of Polish Lipka Tatars still exist and still practice Islam. Some Polish towns, mainly in northeastern Poland (in Podlaskie Voivodeship) have mosques. Tatars arrived as mercenary soldiers beginning in the late 14th century. The Tatar population reached approximately 100,000 in 1630 but the 2002 census showed only 447 people declaring this ethnicity. Ukrainians Ukrainians are scattered in various eastern and northern districts. In the Polish census of 2002 27,172 people declared they belong to this group. Vietnamese Around 30,000 Vietnamese live in Poland, mostly in big cities. Wietnamczyk w postkomunistycznej Europie. rp.pl. Retrieved 2011-05-30. They publish a number of newspapers, both pro- and anti-Communist. The first immigrants were Vietnamese students at Polish universities in the post-World War II era. These numbers increased slightly during the Vietnam War, when agreements between the communist Vietnamese and Polish governments allowed Vietnamese guest workers to receive industrial training in Poland. A large number of Vietnamese immigrants also arrived after 1989.Ewa Nowicka, YOUNG VIETNAMESE GENERATION IN POLAND: CAUGHT BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE, PRZEGLƒÑD ZACHODNI, 2014, No. II Other There are also nationality groups of Americans (in 2002: 1,541 of whom 992 had Polish citizenship), Britons, Turks (232, including 74 Polish citizens), Hungarians (579, including 228 Polish citizens), French (2002: 1,633 including 1,068 Polish citizens), Italians (1,367 including 835 Polish citizens), Serbs, Croats, Bulgarians (1,112, including 404 Polish citizens), Romanians, Georgians, Palestinians (229 including 146 Polish citizens), other Arabs, Kurds, Scandinavians, Chechens, who constitute small ethnic communities within major cities such as Warsaw, Krak√≥w, and Gda≈Ñsk.

January 6, 2010. Retrieved on April 29, 2010. Kahn & Jacobs designed the tower, which is the 98th tallest building in New York. The original facade was said to be designed to resemble the relays which were commonly found inside telephones of the time. History From 2006 to 2007, the tower received a $260 million renovation which upgraded the office space from Class B+ to Class A office space. The phone company moved its headquarters to the Verizon Building at 140 West Street in the early 2000s, and sold off most of the building, retaining a condominium interest in floors 6-12, where Verizon maintained offices and a telephone exchange serving landlines in Midtown Manhattan. However, in 2013, the company moved its corporate headquarters back to 1095 Avenue of the Americas, following a sale of the upper floors of the Verizon Building. In 2015, Ivanho√© Cambridge and Callahan Capital Properties purchased 1095 Avenue of the Americas from The Blackstone Group for $2.2 billion, the most expensive transaction involving a single office building in New York City since 2008. In August 2016, Real Summit Investment, a real estate investment subsidiary of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority‚Äôs Exchange Fund, paid $1.15 billion for a 49% stake in the building. Tenants In addition to Verizon, other major tenants as of late 2008 include insurance giant MetLife (whose name is outside above the entryway), law firm Dechert LLP, iStar Financial, Lloyds Banking Group, Instinet, Standard Chartered USA, and Stifel. In 2013, Whole Foods Market finalized a deal to open a flagship location spread across the first and second floors of the building. The market opened its doors in January 2017. Pandora Jewelry, Tourneau, and Equinox Fitness also operate in the base of the building. ASICS abruptly vacated its space in October 2015 amid a legal battle with the company‚Äôs retail operator, less than a year after moving in. In 2016, Salesforce.com signed a deal to rename the building Salesforce Tower, and the San Francisco-based company plans to eventually occupy 5 floors. The first Salesforce employees in New York City to move to the new office arrived on Monday November 14, 2016. U.S. Bancorp signed a lease for in September 2016 and Apollo Global Management followed in July 2017 with a lease.

The river results from the union of various streams in Urdazubi (Navarre), going on to cross the Spanish-French border at Dantxarinea after meandering across Navarrese soil. The river pours into the Bay of Biscay on the bay of Saint-Jean-de-Luz (French for Donibane Lohizune) after cutting its way between this town and Ciboure (French for Ziburu) on its final stage. At this point, celebrated Basque French composer and arranger Maurice Ravel was born in one of the front houses overlooking the channel. Variety of Basque names For all its shortness, the river takes on several names in Basque language at different stretches of the course, e.g. Sarrakaria, Urma, Uhertsi (spelled sometimes Ur Ertsi), besides the above Ugarana and Urdazuri. This conspicuous diversity reflects the historic situation of the native language, deprived of official recognition whatsoever or transmission through formal schooling up to recent times (and still). Locals, when asked for the name of the river in Basque, often may answer U(r)handi, meaning \\"big water\\", a descriptive naming that has sometimes applied to the neighbouring and main river of Labourd the Errobi/Nive. Troubled waters The geographical situation of the basin makes its climate mild (average temperature 14 ¬∞C) under the influence of humid air masses blowing from the sea. Yet the clash between these air currents and the Pyrenean region spurs sudden showers frequently (average annual rainfall on the watershed 2,000 mm). On May 4, 2007, like in 1983, the banks of the river go through dire consequences on account of floods (170 mm pour down in 24 hours at Saint-P√©e-sur-Nivelle). Many in the village and the whole basin were subject to extensive damage and injuries, including the facilities and equipment of the touristy caves of Urdazubi/Urdax. Echoing a long-running claim of the inhabitants, the dam Lurberria was built in 2008 to contain swollen waters. Fishing and river fauna Brown trout is well entrenched in the river, especially in its upstream tributaries (more than 90 brooks). In contrast, salmon, trout and shad stick to the lower stretch of the Nivelle, where they fall prey to fishers. Actually, since the 1990s a noticeable fail to achieve the upstream spawning areas has been detected in the salmon population, i.e. 470 individuals in 1993 vs 88 in 2003 (checked at Saint-P√©e-sur-Nivelle), the fish remaining largely in the estuary where they are subject to fishing activity. This erratic behaviour has been put down to rising water temperature and climate change. Actually, the threshold of the 12 ¬∞C was topped 60% of the days from 2000 to 2002.

The museum seeks to promote public understanding of prehistory through interpretive exhibits, educational programs, collections, and research. The museum is located near many paleontological and archaeological sites in a region known as Castle Country, notably in the San Rafael Swell and nearby canyons throughout the Book Cliffs area such as Nine Mile Canyon and Range Creek Canyon. History Mounted Utahraptor in the museum's Hall of Dinosaurs The Prehistoric Museum was established in 1961 as a cooperative effort by the former College of Eastern Utah and the community of Price. On May 8, 1961, the Board of Regents established the museum. At that time, funding for the museum was supplied by the geology department at the college. The museum officially opened to the public on June 3, 1961, on the second floor of the Price Municipal Building in a small converted conference room. After expanding into the hallways of the City Hall it moved into the old city gymnasium in 1971. In later years, the museum became an appropriated line item through the State of Utah. In 1990-91, the appropriation for the museum was greatly increased because of the tremendous expansion of the museum. A new addition was opened, later to become the Hall of Dinosaurs. Through these two separate expansions during its 45-year history, the museum has become a facility with another repository and paleontology preparation laboratory. An ongoing program of paleontology fieldwork and excavation begun in 1990 has produced 12 new species of dinosaurs and over 7,000 paleontologic specimens. Federal and state accreditation followed in 1991, allowing the museum to reposit collections from across Utah. Renewed interest in dinosaurs and a popular culture boom brought thousands more visitors down the Dinosaur Diamond Scenic Byway and to the museum in the 1990s. New development in Utah and the renaissance in dinosaur research has resulted in new finds and an increased level of interest in the museum. The museum now serves as an important repository housing over 750,000 prehistoric specimens from around the state. Features The museum's national accreditation by the American Alliance of Museums distinguishes it as fewer than 10% of museums are awarded such accreditation. As a state and federal repository for both paleontological and archaeological collections, the museum's holdings include more than 700,000 archaeological artifacts, comprising one of the largest and most significant collections in the country. Many of these artifacts, such as those left by the indigenous Fremont people, have become world-renowned. The museum's paleontological collection includes type specimens and fossil finds new to science. The collections and exhibits focus on specimens indigenous to the region and include: * Fremont culture exhibits, such as rock art reproductions and the famous Pilling Figurines * Comprehensive display of Utah's Ice Age ecology and Paleoindian presence * The Huntington Mammoth, best-known and one of the best-kept of all fossil elephants * Utahraptor and a dozen other new dinosaurs, several percent of the known global diversity Exhibitions Exhibitions at the museum have included: * The Other Side of Utah - an annual exhibit that opened in 2006, it presents art that reflects the Utah area. * Rock art exhibit - including a restored pictograph panel from Horseshoe Canyon in Canyonlands National Park. * Art elevated art show is an annual event that feature artist from around the State of Utah and started in 2018. * Horns Clubs and Sheild was an exhibit from March 2017 to September 2017 that showcased how animals have developed different weapons and armor to protect themselves. * \\"Weaving a way of life\\" featured Native American basket makers from the four corners area and also weavers of blankets and clothing.

It is renowned for its spectacular Old Red Sandstone coastal cliff scenery which includes sea stacks, blowholes, geos and frequently boiling seas. A car park, coastal trail and interpretive panels serve visitors. The area is popular with climbers because of Yesnaby Castle, a two- legged sea stack just south of the Brough of Bigging. The stack is sometimes described as a smaller version of the Old Man of Hoy. Yesnaby is also one of the very few places where Primula scotica grows. Geology The coastal cliffs are formed from the Lower Devonian sandstones ascribed to the Yesnaby Sandstone Group - a set of geological formations restricted to the Yesnaby area, and to the overlying beds of the Lower Stromness Flagstones. Fossil stromatolites from 390-400 million years ago can be found in the cliffs in the latter. They are locally known as Horse Tooth Stones from a supposed resemblance.  Culture Orkney folklore has it that a woman known as the \\"Yesnaby Healer\\" had the ability to stop bleeding in any person, even over a distance. The Orkney composer Peter Maxwell Davies has immortalised Yesnaby through \\"Yesnaby Ground\\", an Interlude for solo piano. The Archaeology Institute of the University of the Highlands and Islands initiated the Yesnaby Art & Archaeology Research Projecthttp://yaarp.org.uk History During the Second World War an anti-aircraft battery was built on the cliff top at Yesnaby as part of the defences of the Royal Navy base at Scapa Flow.

He played hurling with his club Ballinderreen and the Galway senior team. Early life and education Born in Tuam, County Galway, McDonagh was introduced to hurling by his father, a long- serving Gaelic games administrator and schoolteacher. He developed his hurling skills at Col√°iste √âinde, while also excelling at Gaelic football as a result of the coaching of teacher Enda Colleran. With University College Galway (UCG), McDonagh played both Gaelic football and hurling and was a Fitzgibbon Cup medal winner as a postgraduate student in 1977. He was also a regular on the Sigerson Cup team in his time there, playing in five of the football competitions. He had previously won a Freshers hurling medal in 1972 and earned his B.A. from the university in 1975. His son, Eoin, also played in six Fizgibbon Cups for UCG. McDonagh was a linguist who was fluent in three languages (Irish, English and Welsh). He went on to complete an M.A. in Celtic Studies Career Club McDonagh enjoyed a lengthy club hurling career with Ballinderreen, while he also played Gaelic football with Cortoon Shamrocks and Barna. McDonagh had the honour of captaining his club Ballinderreen to the 1978 Galway Senior Hurling Championship Final. They faced neighbouring club Ardrahan. Played in Ballinasloe, the match ended in a draw, Ballinderreen 0-16 Ardrahan 2-10. After another titanic battle in the replay, McDonagh's side unfortunately lost by 2-14 to 2-18. Towards the latter end of his hurling career, Joe had the honour of captaining his side to win the Galway Junior B hurling Championship in 1996. The win was all the more special to him as his teenage son Eoin was playing alongside him. Inter-county McDonagh made his d√©but on the inter-county scene at the age of sixteen when he first linked up with the Galway minor team. An All-Ireland runner-up in this grade, he later won an All-Ireland medal with the under-21 team. McDonagh made his senior d√©but during the 1972-73 league. He went on to play a key role for Galway during a breakthrough era, and won one All-Ireland medal as a non- playing substitute in 1980 and one National Hurling League medal. He was an All-Ireland runner-up on two occasions. One of the most iconic moments associated with McDonagh is his rendition of \\"The West's Awake\\" from the Hogan Stand in Croke Park after winning that All-Ireland with Galway in 1980. RT√â commentator Michael O'Hehir memorably responded: \\"Well done Joe McDonagh\\". Throughout his career McDonagh made 15 championship appearances for Galway. His retirement came following the conclusion of the 1983 championship. In 2005, the Irish Independent named him amongst its substitutes in its list of \\"The Men Who Changed the Face of Galway Hurling\\". Inter-provincial As a member of the Connacht inter-provincial team at various times throughout his career, McDonagh won two Railway Cup medals. Retirement and later life In retirement from playing McDonagh became involved in the administrative affairs of the Gaelic Athletic Association. He was elected to the Galway County Board as Irish Officer in 1979 and went on to represent Galway on the Central Council in 1988, being appointed to the chair of the hurling work group on his first day. Runner-up to Jack Boothman in the 1993 election for the position, he subsequently became the 32nd President of the Gaelic Athletic Association between 1997 and 2000. McDonagh died on 20 May 2016, following a short illness. Invited to attend a reunion with his teammates at his university in November 2015, he was unable to attend as he had been in hospital with what was thought to be pneumonia. The illness was later discovered to be cancer, which ultimately proved terminal. His son, Eoin, delivering an oration at the funeral mass, quoted O'Hehir in concluding: \\"Well done Joe McDonagh\\". Eponym The Joe McDonagh Cup was created in 2017 as the new second tier senior inter-county championship in hurling after the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship. It was contested for the first time in 2018.

It was built in the early 1920s and soon afterward bought by Tom Pendergast, a local political boss, who arranged for connecting access between his office and the hotel. The hotel closed in 1971, and the building was later converted to condominium use. Origin The need for affordable working class hotel space south of downtown came about as the result of the completion of Union Station in 1914. Raymond H. Sanneman designed the Monroe Hotel in 1920 for the Dubinsky Brothers, and Elelman-Fleming Construction Company served as the general contractor. The five-story hotel was constructed of reinforced concrete with brick and terra cotta at an estimated cost of $150,000. The Historic Monroe Hotel in Kansas City, MO Ownership by Thomas J. Pendergast Political boss Thomas J. Pendergast purchased the Monroe Hotel in 1924, and he hired Sanneman to design a two-story building adjacent to the south side of the hotel that would serve as the headquarters for his Jackson County Democratic Club. Pendergast operated out of the two-story building at 1908 Main until the late 1930s. Pendergast had a doorway installed between his second floor office and the hotel, giving him a clandestine entry point and access to the hotel's elevator. After Pendergast's release from prison for income tax evasion, a Federal Court ordered the doorway to be sealed and barred Pendergast from any further political activity.

The 2-25 was purpose designed to compete in the 1954 World Gliding Championships held in Great Hucklow, United Kingdom and was also flown in the World Championships held in 1956. There was insufficient market demand to produce the aircraft and so only one example was completed. Background In 1954, for the first time at a World Soaring Championships, there was a class for two-place gliders. Each nation was permitted to enter two single-place gliders and one two-place. Schweizer Aircraft supplied all the gliders for the US team: the sole Schweizer SGS 1-23E was purpose built for Paul MacCready, a Schweizer SGS 1-23D for Paul A Schweizer and the SGS 2-25 to be flown by Stan Smith and Bob Kidder. The small fleet of aircraft were all sent to the UK by ship from Montreal, bound for Liverpool. Development The 2-25 was a new project, a high performance two-place sailplane. Schweizer had hoped to demonstrate the glider at the world competition and then manufacture additional copies for sale. Schweizer constructed the 2-25 over the winter of 1953-54 and had it ready to fly in the spring of 1954. The aircraft was of all-metal construction and was the largest glider that the company had built at that time. The 2-25 has a 60-foot (18.29 m) wingspan and a gross weight of 1450 lbs (657 kg). It has triple spoilers, with two on the top and one on the bottom of each wing. Due to the lack of orders for the design it was never certified and the sole example was flown in the \\"experimental\\" category, registered as N91892. Competition and operations 1954 World Championships Stan Smith and Bob Kidder flew the SGS 2-25 in the World Soaring Championships at the Derbyshire and Lancashire Gliding Club in Great Hucklow, United Kingdom held between July 20-August 4, 1954 and finished third out of a field of nine two- place sailplanes. The competition was fraught with difficulties. While the US sent a full team to compete, including a manager/meteorologist and assistant manager, fund-raising for the team was not successful and most of the team members had to pay their own way to Great Britain to compete. The contest featured the worst weather recorded in over fifty years. The contest was held over 14 days, but only four days were flyable contest days, due to the rain and low cloud. Before the contest started, the competition pilots were flown over the routes in a light aircraft to gain familiarity. The ceiling and visibility were so poor that the four pilots on board got repeatedly lost on the flight. The contest opened with two good flying days, followed by a week of rain. By the end of the second contest day, Kidder and Smith were in second place. The third contest day saw them complete the day's best flight. Unfortunately the flight was invalid as not enough other contestants finished the task to validate it. While landing at the end of the third day, Kidder and Smith put the 2-25 into a small English field and it was damaged. The SGS 2-25 could not be stopped within the confines of the field and it collided with a heavy wooden fence at the edge of the field. A heavy fence crossbeam ended up on top of the 2-25's canopy as the sailplane slid under the fence. The fence itself did not break the canopy, but the canopy could not be opened, leaving the crew trapped in the glider. The pilots had to enlist the aid of a farmer to remove the fence beam and extract them from the aircraft. Although slightly damaged, the 2-25 was eventually removed from the field and loaded on its trailer. When the towing vehicle had to stop for gasoline the 2-25's fin and rudder were damaged on a low-hanging petrol-filling station canopy over the pumps. This all guaranteed that the 2-25 would not fly in the contest again and it missed the final flyable day of the competition. 1955 The Jetstream Project The SGS 2-25 was repaired at Schweizer Aircraft and put to work as part of the Jetstream Project. This was a joint USAF Cambridge Research Center and UCLA Department of Meteorology research project to gain a better understanding of Lee waves and was flown in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California. The 2-25 proved very useful on the project and good data were gathered from many days of wave flying, including four days where flights over 40,000 feet were made. Pressure-jump waves were studied as part of the 1955 project. 1956 World Championships The 1956 Worlds were held in Saint- Yan, France and saw the SGS 2-25 flown in the two-place category, by Kemp Trager and Gene Miller. The team of Miller and Trager finished fourth in that contest, without damage to the 2-25. USAF use The 2-25 was later sold to George Arents Jr, who, after flying it for some years, donated it to the gliding program at the United States Air Force Academy. The 2-25 served there for many years under the designation of TG-1A. This was a new series of USAF designations and the 2-25 should not be confused with the Frankfort TG-1 of Second World War vintage. The Frankfort TG-1 had the same designation under an earlier military designation system. While in USAF service the 2-25 was registered as N225AF. Museum The 2-25 was donated to the National Soaring Museum and is now on permanent loan to the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio. Federal Aviation Administration records show the SGS 2-25 as \\"destroyed\\" in May 2000.

The village is located in the municipality of Paeonia, Kilkis regional unit of Central Macedonia (Greece). The village is built at an elevation of 65 meters, in the outskirts of Kouri hill. It mounts in the west bank of Axios river, close to the border with Republic of North Macedonia. The village is interwoven with a railway station, which is the first railway station that someone meets entering Greece from the north. The inhabitants of Idomeni are Macedonian Greeks/Slavophones, as well as descendants of refugees from East Thrace after the Population exchange between Greece and Turkey in 1923. History Eidomene is mentioned by Strabo at his work Geographica and by Thucydides at his work History of the Peloponnesian War. Before 1926, it was also known as Sehovo (, , ) or Seovo (), and it was renamed in 1936 to the namesake of the ancient Greek town \\"Idomene\\", which was mounted near the modern village. During the Greek War of Independence in 1821, the inhabitants of Sechovo/Idomeni (Sechovites) revolted against the Ottoman authorities, under Zafirios Stamatiades, one of the leaders who later fought in southern Greece. The village was destroyed by the Ottoman military authorities in 1824 as a retaliation for the participation in the revolt. From 1870 until the Balkan Wars, a lot of national conflicts between Greeks and Bulgarians took place in the village. In the book \\"Ethnographie des Vilayets d'Adrianople, de Monastir et de Salonique\\", published in Constantinople in 1878, that reflects the statistics of the male population in 1873, Seovo was noted as a village with 85 households and 394 Bulgarian inhabitants.–ú–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω–∏—è –∏ –û–¥—Ä–∏–Ω—Å–∫–æ. –°—Ç–∞—Ç–∏—Å—Ç–∏–∫–∞ –Ω–∞ –Ω–∞—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ—Ç–æ –æ—Ç 1873 –≥.\\" –ú–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω—Å–∫–∏ –Ω–∞—É—á–µ–Ω –∏–Ω—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—É—Ç, 1995. —Å—Ç—Ä. 168-169.

(in French) Transportation Close to Idomeni, there is the Railway Station of Idomeni, with trains to Thessaloniki, Belgrade and Central Europe.  Migrants  Since 2014, immigrants from Syria, as well as Afghanistan, Pakistan and other parts of the Middle East and South Asia began to flock to Idomeni to enter the North Macedonia via the Greek border. As North Macedonia and its northern neighbor Serbia are not in the Schengen Area, some refugees prefer this route to reach countries such as Germany and Sweden. Re-entering the Schengen Area from Serbia may result in arrest and possibly being held in Croatia or Hungary which are closer to their preferred immigration destinations, notably Germany. In 2015, the North Macedonia began guarding its borders with military force to prevent migrants from entering the country since Serbia too closed its borders. The transit camp at Idomeni, built in 2015 by M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res and the UNHCR to provide basic support for up to 6000 refugees daily, rapidly became a longer-term residential camp. The number of refugees at Idomeni has reached more than 15,000. On the 24th of May 2016, Greek authorities began relocating refugees from the Idomeni camp to processing facilities in and around Thessaloniki.

DEP manages the City's water supply, providing more than 1 billion US gallons (3,800,000 m3) of water each day to more than 9 million residents, including 8 million in New York City. New York City's water is delivered from a watershed that extends more than 125 miles (201 km) from the City, and comprises 19 reservoirs, and three controlled lakes. Approximately 7,000 miles (11,000 km) of water mains, tunnels and aqueducts bring water to homes and businesses throughout the five boroughs, and 7,400 miles (11,900 km) of sewer lines take waste water to 14 in-City treatment plants. DEP is also one of the City's largest agencies with 6,000 employees and over $11 billion in current construction projects. As the head of DEP's Public Affairs Division, Mahoney oversees all external relations from intergovernmental issues to marketing, education, communications, economic development and community affairs for its 6,000employees across New York State. In addition to his duties at DEP following Super Storm Sandy, Mahoney was appointed by Mayor Michael Bloomberg as the community restoration director for Manhattan and the Bronx. Calling Mahoney one of the \\"seasoned, high-level managers in our administration that I have enormous confidence in\\", Bloomberg gave Matthew the task of spearheading the relief for the immediate human needs of people recovering from Sandy's effects. Prior to being appointed Associate Commissioner, Mahoney was a senior advisor to the Bloomberg reelection campaign, helping to steer Bloomberg towards a historic third term. Under his direction, Bloomberg gained the support of all five of New York City's Republican Counties, a first in the Mayor's three elections. Previously, Mahoney was the Executive Director of the New York State Senate Republican Committee, based in Albany, New York, overseeing the efforts of Republican Senators in the legislature. Matthew served as a senior political advisor for the Rudolph W. Giuliani Presidential Committee. In addition to his position, he also took on the role of Giuliani's chief New York State strategist. He built and managed a New York staff and briefed New York donors on campaign strategy, press issues and events. In 2002, Mahoney became a founding member and Vice President at Giuliani Partners, LLC specializing in Government Affairs and Operations consulting. During this time he served as a liaison to the White House Office of Political Affairs for Giuliani, as well as serving as the day to day point of contact for local, statewide, and federal Republican races across the United States. It was during this time that Mahoney played an integral role in laying the groundwork for Giuliani's future presidential campaign. From 1998 through 2001, Mahoney served as the Deputy Director of Advance for the Mayor's Office of the City of New York. After September 11, 2001, he coordinated the visits of foreign heads of state, United States government officials and other dignitaries to Ground Zero. As part of his role Mahoney attended cabinet meetings and briefings at the City's Emergency Operations Center as a member of the Mayor's Executive Staff. Matthew lives with his wife and two children in Staten Island, New York.

National Coal Board was an important case in English case law. The 1949 case revolved around whether it was \\"reasonably practicable\\" to prevent even the smallest possibility of a rock fall in a coal mine. Safety Photo Account of the case 15 December 2017 Underlying facts Mr Edwards died in an accident after the supporting structure for the mine roadway gave way. The National Coal Board argued that it was too expensive to shore up every roadway in all of the mines. The case turned when it was decided that it was not 'all of the roadways' that needed shoring up; just the ones that required it. In essence this established the need to carry out a risk assessment to establish the cost, time and trouble to mitigate a risk balanced against the risk of any harm it might cause. Asquith stated in his judgement: Significance This case established the concept of \\"reasonable practicability.\\" The Court of Appeal decided that \\"reasonably practicable\\" was a more narrowly defined phrase than what was \\"physically possible.\\" This allowed for the creation of equations that measured the risk present in a given situation against the reasonable practicability of mitigating that risk. In other words, the equation asked if averting the risk was worth the effort it took to negate that risk.Mondaq Business Briefing, 2 August 2007 In addition, the court in Edwards determined that the size and wealth of the company should have no bearing on such decisions.\\"Law for Health & Safety Practitioners\\", an article on LawTeacher.net.

In 1928, the school moved to the former engineering building, which was renamed the Commerce Building. The College moved to its present location at 220 North McIlroy in 1978 following the completion of the Business Building. It was renamed to Sam M. Walton College of Business Administration following a $50 million donation from the Walton Family Charitable Support Foundation in 1998. The Donald W. Reynolds Center for Enterprise Development at 145 North Buchanan was built following a grant from Donald W. Reynolds Foundation in 1996. Following the Campaign for the 21st Century, the Walton College saw a period of rapid facility growth. Willard J. Walker Hall at 191 North Harmon and the J.B. Hunt Transport Services Center for Academic Excellence at 227 North Harmon opened in 2007 adjacent to the Business Building, enclosing the Linda Sue Shollmier Plaza and creating a business campus within the southern part of the UA campus.

Purely an exhibition bird, Modern Game were developed to be most aesthetically pleasing and to epitomize the visual appeal of the gamecock or fighting cock.  History  A Modern Game hen in the United States After cockfighting was made illegal in Britain in 1849, many cockfighting enthusiasts turned to breeding for shows as an alternative poultry hobby, and the Modern Game was developed from crosses of Old English Game and Malays. Despite being classified as game chickens (i.e. of cockfighting derivation) in breed standards, Modern Game were not bred to fight. Game, as they were then called, were included in nine colours in the Standard of Excellence in Exhibition Poultry, the first edition of the British Poultry Standard, in 1865; a Game bantam was also included. Eight colours of Game were included in the first edition of the Standard of Perfection of the American Poultry Association in 1874. Characteristics Today, the ideal show bird should have a body shaped like a flat iron when seen from above, a relatively short back, fine tail, hard feathering, and a very upright carriage. The breed appears in more than a dozen colour variations. The most common being black red, birchen, brown red, duckwing and pyle. The colours can be broadly divided into two groups; those with willow-coloured legs and red eyes, and those with black legs and dark eyes. The colour of the skin, comb, and wattles varies from red to mulberry depending on variety, but all have a small single comb. Combs and wattles are required to be dubbed (cut off) of all cocks, and any cockerels being shown after November 1st, in order to compete in showing in some countries, which reflects their descent from fighting birds. As in many breeds, there are both standard and bantam sizes of Modern Game. According to the standard of the Poultry Club of Great Britain, standard-sized cocks weigh and hens , while bantams weigh and respectively. The bantam version is the most popular among poultry fanciers. Use Modern Game are not good egg layers, nor are they valued for meat production. They are almost exclusively kept by competitive breeders. In temperament, they are friendly and curious towards people, and are easily tamed. For this reason the Modern Game is considered a suitable pet for the suburban poultry keeper.

Description A Nun in profile. The Nun is given its name by the raised feathers which form a kind of hood which covers the back of the neck and head. Continental Europe previously referred to the Nun as the Dutch Shell Pigeon during the early part of the 20th century. It resembles the tumbler, from which this breed of pigeon originated; although as with all domestic pigeons they are descended from the rock pigeon (Columba livia). They have mostly white bodies and are designated according to the color of their head, i.e. a black headed Nun, or a yellow headed Nun. Only the head, tail and the flight feathers should be so colored. Nuns are one breed in a group of pigeons who fly at high altitudes, along with types of tumblers and the magpie pigeon. The British Nun Club standard for the Nun states that the ideal size for male birds should be from the top of the bird's head to their feet, and from the front of the chest to its tail. Female and young birds should be roughly the same size. The beak should be straight but stout, and the eyes a pearly white.

They stand out for their red ashlar and white harled exteriors, and for their prominent position, most visible from Princes Street. Developed into its current form between 1890 and 1893 by the biologist, botanist and urban planner Patrick Geddes, Ramsay Garden started out as Ramsay Lodge, an octagonal house built by the poet and wig- maker Allan Ramsay the Elder in 1733.Kitchen 1975: 124, Lessware and Gibson 2006 The house was also known variously as Ramsay Hut and Goosepie House (due to the roof shape). It was complemented by the addition of Ramsay Street, a short row of simple Georgian Houses in 1760.http://maps.nls.uk/view/74400071 The latter (in revamped form) stand on the north side of the access to the inner courtyard. History Geddes' work on Ramsay Garden began in the context of an urban renewal project that he had embarked on in Edinburgh‚Äôs Old Town. The area had fallen into disrepair, and Geddes hoped both to improve the living conditions of the working class, and to increase the number of wealthier residents. He was also involved in improving buildings for use as student accommodation. To these purposes Geddes rehabilitated a significant number of tenement buildings in slums along the Royal Mile,Meller 1990: 76 including Abbey Cottages, Whitehorse Close and Riddle‚Äôs Court.Kitchen 1975: 119 The Ramsay Garden development also served these aims. It was partly financed by the prospective buyers of the apartments, and partly by 2000 pounds that Geddes's wife, Anna Morton, had inherited from her father. Geddes engaged the architect Stewart Henbest Capper to remodel Ramsay Lodge, and to build six large new blocks onto it at right angles to each other.Kitchen 1975: 124 By this time Geddes had acquired a position at a university in London, but he continued to supervise the design of Ramsay Garden on his frequent trips to Edinburgh. The final year of building work was overseen by Sydney Mitchell, who had taken over as architect, due to Capper's poor health. and was also permitted to add some additional detailing. The result of these partnerships was a combination of traditional Scottish domestic architecture and a rather fanciful proliferation of balconies, towers and eaves. Geddes referred to Ramsay Garden in later years as the \\"seven-towered castle I built for my beloved\\".Mairet 1957: 74 Guide books like to attribute the bulk of the design to the better-known Sydney Mitchell but the bulk of both the concept and design is that of Capper. As a result of his own experiences in universities, and inspired by the better student facilities he had seen in Europe, Geddes was also concerned with the provision of quality accommodation for students. By the time Ramsay Garden was being built he had already established other student Halls of Residence in partnership with the Town and Gown Association.Meller 1990: 76‚Äì7 By the end of the 19th century he had managed to provide enough housing for more than 200 university students and staff.Kitchen 1975: 131 The Halls of Residence were intended to be self-governing, with responsibility for drawing up house rules left to the students themselves. The Ramsay Lodge section of the Ramsay Garden development was used for this purpose.Kitchen 1975: 115‚Äì9 Murals painted by John Duncan on the walls of the dining and common rooms depicted images from Celtic myth and history.Boardman 1978: 149 Lectures and seminars were sometimes held on the premises.Kitchen 1975: 146 Other parts of Ramsay Garden were available to the public. The Geddes family lived in number 14, a twelve-room apartment on the fourth storey. By all accounts it was an impressive residence. The drawing-room was two rooms connected by an archway, with the whole measuring 20 by 40 feet. The sweeping views, which reached as far as the old Kingdom of Fife,Boardman 1978: 121 could be admired through the bay and turret window spaces at each end. This room was regularly used for large gatherings. Frescoes by Charles Mackie graced the master bedroom.Boardman 1978: 123 The lease of the apartment was eventually sold to the Town and Gown Association due to Geddes's financial difficulties.Kitchen 1975: 254 Although he later wished to repurchase it, his desire for the apartment to remain in the family was not fulfilled.Kitchen 1975: 277 Ramsay Lodge was the last of the University Halls to be sold off by the Town and Gown Association.

It is a true bantam, a naturally small breed with no large counterpart from which it was miniaturised. It is of South-east Asian origin, and is among the oldest bantam breeds. It is a yellowish buff colour, and the name is thought to derive from the colour of nankeen cotton from China.  History  The Nankin is thought to be one of the oldest true bantam breeds, originating somewhere in Southeast Asia. Though they first became widespread in the West only in the 18th century, there is evidence for their presence in England going back to the 16th century. As a bantam long present in the UK especially, the Nankin contributed to the formation of many other bantams more common today, such as the Sebright. Nankin are listed on the Endangerd species list as 'Critical'. They are very rarely found in the USA. The number of Nankins declined in the West after the mid 19th century, along with the importation of newer and more exotic Asian breeds. Though their popularity with poultry fanciers waned, the use of broody Nankin hens to incubate game bird eggs may have kept the breed from disappearing altogether. Interest in Nankins in North America largely sprung out of attention from the American Bantam Association in the 1960s. Today, Nankins are recognised by the American Bantam Association, and have been accepted into the American Poultry Association's Standard of Perfection as of 2012. A US breed club was formed for the first time in 2006. They are classified as critically endangered by the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy. In 2002 the total number for the breed was estimated at 50‚Äì100 birds; the conservation status of the Nankin was listed by the FAO as \\"critical\\" in 2007. In 2017, the Nankin was not among the \\"priority breeds\\" on the watchlist of the Rare Breeds Survival Trust.  Characteristics  The breed has two varieties, differentiated by comb type; the single comb Nankin has a large comb with five points, and the rose comb has a medium size one ending in a single point. All Nankins come in a single colour, with buff on the body and black tails. The golden hue is deeper and more lustrous in males, and they have the longer sickle feathers common in cocks. Their beaks are a light horn colour, and legs are slate blue. Nankins are very friendly in disposition. Though they retain the ability to fly because of their small bodies and relatively large, downward-slanted wings, they tend to be less active and flighty than other bantams overall. They do well in confinement, and tend not to wander much when allowed to free range. Due to their small size and more prominent comb and wattles (especially in the single comb variety), they are not cold hardy chickens, and require insulated shelter in northern regions.  Use  The Nankin is usually reared for fancy and exhibition. The hens lay well, and are good sitters. Their eggs are very small and a creamy white colour. As with some other bantam breeds, broody Nankin hens were traditionally used to incubate the eggs of game birds such as pheasant, quail and partridge. The breed matures slowly, and makes a poor meat producer.

Kunio Yanagita also emphasized that while the use of character like Ëô¨ may suggest a snake-like being, it should be stressed that the mizuchi signifies a \\"water spirit\\".; \\"Since we now write the word as Ëô¨, it would strike people with Chinese knowledge that this might be a type of snake, but the meaning of the word merely consists of the word for‚Äòwater‚Äôattached with the character chi which means something like ‚Äòspiritual being‚Äô, so it signifies none other than a water spirit. ‰ªä„Åß„ÅØËô¨„Å®Êõ∏„Åè„ÅÆ„Åß„ÄÅÊîØÈÇ£„ÅÆÁü•Ë≠ò„ÇíÊåÅ„Å£„Å¶„ÅÑ„Çã‰∫∫„Åü„Å°„ÅØËõá„ÅÆÈ°û„Å†„Çç„ÅÜ„Å®ÊÄù„Å£„Å¶„ÅÑ„Çã„Åå„ÄÅÂ≠óÁæ©„Åã„Çâ„ÅÑ„Å£„Å¶„ÇÇÊ∞¥„Å®„ÅÑ„ÅÜË®ÄËëâ„Å´„ÄÅÈúäÁâ©„Å®„Åã‰Ωï„Å®„Åã„ÅÑ„ÅÜÊÑèÂë≥„ÅÆ„ÉÅ„Å®„ÅÑ„ÅÜÂ≠ó„Åå„Å§„ÅÑ„Å¶„ÅÑ„Çã„Å†„Åë„Å™„ÅÆ„Å†„Åã„Çâ„ÄÅÊ∞¥„ÅÆÈúä„Å®„ÅÑ„ÅÜ„Åì„Å®„Å´Â§ñ„Å™„Çâ„Å™„ÅÑ\\". Early references The ancient chronicle Nihongi contains references to mizuchi. Under the 67th year of the reign of Emperor Nintoku (conventionally dated 379 AD), it is mentioned that in central Kibi Province, at a fork on Kawashima River (Â∑ùÂ∂ãÊ≤≥, old name of Takahashi River in Okayama Prefecture), a great water serpent or dragon (Â§ßËô¨) dwelt and would breathe or spew out its venom, poisoning and killing many passersby. This mizuchi was exterminated by a man named , ancestor of the clan. He approached the pool of the river, cast three calabashes which floated to the surface of the water and challenged the beast to make these gourds sink, threatening to slay it should it fail. The beast transformed into a deer and tried unsuccessfully to sink them, whereby the man slew the monster. The record goes on to say: \\"...He further sought out the water-dragon's fellows. Now the tribe of all the water-dragons filled a cave in the bottom of the pool. He slew them every one and the water of the river became changed to blood. Therefore that water was called the pool of Agatamori\\".Nihon shoki, Book 11., Nintoku Tenno, year 67. Original text: \\"ÊòØÊ≠≥ÊñºÂêâÂÇô‰∏≠ÂõΩÂ∑ùÂ∂ãÊ≤≥Ê¥æÊúâÂ§ßËô¨‰ª§Ëã¶‰∫∫ÊôÇË∑Ø‰∫∫Ëß¶ÂÖ∂Âá¶ËÄåË°åÂøÖË¢´ÂÖ∂ÊØí‰ª•Â§öÊ≠ª‰∫°\\"tr. . A river-god reported seen in Nintoku 11 (putatively 323 AD) is also regarded by commentators to be a mizuchi, due to paralleling circumstances. On that year, the built along Yodo River kept getting breached and the Emperor guided by an oracular dream ordered two men, Kowa-kubi from Musashi Province and Koromo-no-ko from Kawachi Province be sought ought and sacrificed to the \\"River God\\" or . One of the men, who resisted being sacrificed, employed the floating calabash and dared the River God to sink it as proof to show it was truly divine will that demanded him as sacrifice. A whirlwind came and tried, but the calabash just floated away, and thus he extricated himself from death using his wits. Although River God is not called mizuchi in the source, Aston has regarded the River God (Kawa-no- kami) and the mizuchi as equivalent. concludes, \\"From this passage, we learn that in ancient times human sacrifices were made to the dragon-shaped river- gods\\". Michael Dylan Foster suggests this is \\"perhaps the first documented appearance of the water spirit that would become known popularly in Japan as the kappa\\". A mizuchi is also mentioned in the Man'y≈çsh≈´, the ancient collection of Japanese poems. The tanka poem #3833 composed by Man'y≈çsh≈´ #3833 by Prince Saikabe, original text:\\"ËôéÂ∞ì‰πó Âè§Â±ã‰πéË∂äËÄå ÈùíÊ∑µÂ∞ì ÈÆ´ÈæçÂèñÂ∞ÜÊù• ÂäíÂàÄÊØõÊàë\\" can be loosely paraphrased to mean \\"I could ride a tiger to leap over the Old Shack, to the green pool, to take down the mizuchi dragon there, if only I had a sword capable of doing just that\\".: \\"[I would] ride a tiger and leap over Furuya (Old Shack), and I want a sword enough to destroy the dragon in the green pool.

Folklorist studies  Polymath Minakata Kumagusu, in his essay states \\"Even in our country (Japan), the various snakes that dwelled by water and were feared by people seemed to have been called mizuchi, or 'master of the water'\\".; , \\"Year of the Snake\\", p. 159 Here Minakata draws on Edo Period scholar Motoori Norinaga' suggestion that the -chi signified an honorific.; , \\"Year of the Dragon\\", p. 116 As stated above folklorist Yanagita emphasized the meaning of chi as \\"spirit\\".  Corruption into kappa  Minakata also conjectured that in some parts of the country, mizuchi eventually came to be regarded as creatures of the kappa kind. This is because the kappa creatures are known locally by many names that sound much like mizuchi, such as mizushi (former Noto Province, Ishikawa Prefecture), medochi (Nanbu region, parts of Iwate, Aomori, Akita), mintsuchi (Ezo, now Hokkaido)., \\"Year of the Dragon\\", p. 117; \\"Year of the Serpent\\", p. 159 Furthermore, in the lore of Echigo Province (Niigata Prefecture), the kappa was said to abhor the calabash gourd,Yanagita, Kunio (1914), Sant≈ç mintan sh≈´, p. 84, cited by Minakata which is reminiscent of the episodes in Nihon Shoki where the River God or mizuchi are challenged to submerge the calabashes., \\"Year of the Dragon\\", p. 117 Similar observations are made by folklorists Yanagita and Jun'ichir≈ç Ishikawa. Minakata was also encouraged by the fact that the snake and the kappa (alongside the suppon soft-shelled turtle) were grouped as three creatures known to kill humans in water by 's essay Zen'an zuihitsu and conjectured that there used to be lore where sacred snakes which were \\"masters of the body of water\\" would transform into human form and wreak havoc, but terms such as mizushi became reserved for the kappa-kind, whereas the terms to refer to the \\"masters of the body of water\\" as mizuchi became forgotten., \\"Year of the Serpent\\", p. 159 In popular culture ;(vehicles, vessels) * ' (), (synonymous with mizuchi), an ex-Japanese Navy submarine. * Jiaolong (), a Chinese deep-ocean submersible. ;(novels) * , a 1998 horror novel by and its 2006 horror movie adaptation directed by , entitled \\"Death Water\\" in English, though theme is \\"water spirit\\" and not dragon. * Sohryuden: Legend of the Dragon Kings (novel) ‚Äì A man named is an allusion. ;(manga, anime) * Eight Clouds Rising ‚Äì is one of seven divine swords. * GeGeGe no Kitaro (manga, anime) ‚Äì a k≈çry≈´ (syn. mizuchi) appears as adversary. * Omamori Himari (manga, novella, anime) ‚Äì the character Shizuku is a mizuchi. * Our Home's Fox Deity. ‚Äì A miko priestess is possessed by a mizuchi. * Samurai Deeper Kyo (manga) ‚Äì Demon Eyes Kyo uses an attack called \\"mizuchi\\" in his sword fighting style.

During his university years his friendship with Enrico Fermi intensified. He graduated in 1921. In 1926 he was already teaching physics at the University of Rome, and co-authored with Fermi on the topic of wave mechanics. He then moved to Florence, where he organized lectures on wave mechanics. At the end of 1930 he was called to Turin. From Turin he maintained relationships with Fermi. He was a witness to the discovery of the slowing down of neutrons and recorded results of the readings of the counters used by Fermi in order to measure the activity induced by neutrons in particles of silver, with and without the presence of paraffin. In the autumn of the 1949 Persico, discouraged from the oppressive atmosphere of the post-war period, accepted a position in Canada, taking the place of Franco Rasetti. In the autumn of 1950 he returned to Rome, to take up the advanced Physical Chair. He continued an interest in optoelectronics, an area that had already cultivated in Canada. In the 1953 Persico directed the theoretical work that underpinned the construction of a 1.1 GeV synchrotron.

His maternal grandfather was an Episcopalian minister, and Erikson was raised a Protestant.

Wayward Puritans Wayward Puritans is the title of his first book (1966) which contains a chapter on sociology of deviance and a chapter on the Massachusetts Bay Colony before three illustrations of deviance within the colony. The first was associated with Anne Hutchinson and Governor Vane and called the Antinomian Controversy. The second was concerned with an intrusion of Quakers, while the third was the Salem witch trials. The book notes the deviation from the City upon a Hill ideal set by John Winthrop. H. Lawrence Ross described the book as \\"fascinating and superbly written\\". The sociological premise explored is from √âmile Durkheim: \\"a function of deviance is to define the normative boundaries of the group.\\" He notes that it is \\"a remarkable exception to the well-known tendency of sociological research to focus on the here and now.\\" On the statistical analysis Ross comments: \\"the reasons to expect constancy of deviance over time, such as the limited capacity of the control system, would seem to predict stability of convictions as much as stability of offenders, and in consequence the analysis here seems unsatisfactory.‚ÄùH.

After the incident, he meets with Kate de Vries, and is saddened to hear that Kate will soon return to Lionsgate City. Canada's Minister of Air wants Canadians to be the first in space, and invites Kate to join the expedition as an expert in aerial zoology, while Matt is offered a chance to become one of the world's first astronauts on board the Starclimber. Matt decides to visit his mother and sisters. While he is there, he accepts a party invitation sent by Mr. and Mrs. de Vries. During the party, Matt is informed that Kate's parents will probably marry Kate to James Sanderson. Upon hearing this, Matt seeks out Mr. Sanderson during the party. Matt is enrolled in the astralnaut program and becomes friends with fellow astralnaut trainee Tobias Blanchard. Three people are chosen to be the first astralnauts, but Matt is not amongst them. When he leaves the room, Kate follows him to try and cheer him up. When she takes his hands, Matt finds an engagement ring on her finger. Matt leaves, heartbroken, and goes to a bar with the rest of the rejected astralnauts-in-training. The other astralnauts tell him that he deserved to be chosen. The next morning, Captain Walken tells him that one of the men they chose broke his leg, and offers Matt a spot on the space trip as a replacement. Matt accepts, even though the thought of seeing Kate again is painful. When the crew is at zero gravity, Tobias is chosen to be the first man in space. He is enthralled by the endless vista of space in front of him and threatens to unclip his harness, provoking Matt to rescue Tobias. That evening, they discover a problem in the cable that endangers the crew. They quickly come to the conclusion that the rocket that pulled the cable up did not reach the proper altitude because of a blown fuse. The team successfully relaunches the rocket, and Matt rescues Captain Walken along the way. Later on, they discover a new creature ‚Äì which Kate names \\"etherian\\" ‚Äì a limbless creature having baleen that moves by ejecting bursts of air from various holes in its body and emanates light like a firefly. During the journey, Matt discovers a letter from James Sanderson to Kate, leading him to believe that Kate really is preparing to marry James. That night, he tells Tobias his feelings for Kate, hoping that he can help him with his troubles. Tobias suggests that Matt propose to Kate. When he does, Kate attempts to change the subject, only to provoke Matt into claiming that she is lying to him about breaking off her engagement with James Sanderson. A few days after Matt's failed proposal, the Starclimber is homebound. However, unexpected astral barnacles are discovered on the cable. The cable snaps, Shepherd is killed, and the Starclimber is left drifting in space with no way to return to the surface. The remaining members of Starclimber are left in orbit around the earth when Matt develops a crude but brilliant brainstorm using an emergency oxygen tank as a propellant and using the toilets' flush mechanisms as maneuvering jets, giving the crew only one chance to reenter the atmosphere. The beginning launch is successful, but Captain Walken is knocked unconscious, and Matt and Tobias are left as the only members of Starclimber's crew who are able to pilot her. Together with Kate and Dr. Turgenev, the four manage to guide the Starclimber into the first stage of reentry. While they are falling, Kate throws away her engagement ring and confesses her love for Matt. However, Dr. Turgenev reveals that everyone already knew, adding that it was \\"painfully obvious\\". The Starclimber, after a turbulent fall, successfully lands in Cairo. Kate receives a telegram from her mother, saying that James Sanderson had eloped with another woman. Once Kate and Matt are alone, she apologizes to him. Matt then proposes to her again, using Sanderson's engagement ring, and she accepts, though they both know that getting Kate's parents' consent will be difficult.

In 1968, he represented his country in the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico. In the 1970s he worked as national coach for the Royal Dutch Athletic Union (KNAU). From the age of 16 Steylen was active in track and field events, especially the field events belonging to the decathlon. In his junior time, he became Dutch javelin throw champion and won a silver medal in the pole vault event. Afterwards he specialised in the middle distance running events and obtained his first success when becoming Dutch 800 metres champion in 1961. As a result of his regular endurance training sessions, Steylen started to give preference to long distance running. He decided to try to run the marathon, but his first acquaintance with this event ended up in a disappointment, as he finished the race in 2 hours and 45 minutes. Then he decided to specialise and became a five times Dutch champion. He was also the first Dutchman to break through the 2 hours and 20 minutes barrier: on 12 May 1968 he finished a marathon in Husum in 2:19:07.1,World Marathon Rankings for 1968 on www.arrs.run improving on his former national record by more than three minutes.

Etymology  The first member of the Nolasco family was Guillaume de Nolasque, a Norman noble who participated in the siege of Nola, in southern Italy, in the eleventh century. Legend has it that, such was his bravery, that he was nicknamed by his fellows \\"Nolasque\\" or \\"Nolasc\\", which means, in the Italian-Norman medieval dialect, \\"the man of Nola\\". Guillaume later returned to Normandy and built the Nolasque castle, in Cotentin. He was the husband of Oremburge, a daughter of Serlo I of Hauteville, and had three sons: Geoffroy (1st sire of Vignats), Nicholas (canon in Rouen) and Roger (who stayed in Toulouse, and was the ancestor of saint Peter Nolasco).  Rank of nobility   1. France  The Nolasque were lords of Vignats and Verson, in Normandy. Aubert de Nolasque, a grandson of Guillaume, was lord of Castelnaudary, in Southern France. In the fifteenth century, Louis Albert de Nolasque, vice-admiral of France, was Baron of L√©on, in Brittany.  2. Spain  The Nolasco came to Spain in the thirteenth century, with Saint Peter. His nephew, Jacques (or Jaime) became Viscount of Ardales, near M√°laga. In the twentieth century, the Nolasco became Marquesses of Torre Soto de Briviesca and Bonanza.  3. England  Sir Raynault de Nolasque, a French noble, came to England during the reign of Edward III, and married Isolda of Audley, a niece of the first Earl of March, Lord Roger Mortimer, the famous lover of queen Isabella of France. One of their descendants was George Leopold Nolasque (born 1818), builder of Nolasque Manor, in Wiltshire, and personal friend of Queen Victoria.

Ice formations appear in the shaft during the spring of the year, continue through the hot weather, and disappear in winter. Ice appears in various shapes and forms, often as huge icicles measuring from 1 to in thickness, and from 15 to in length; the ice is generally clear and sparkling. A theory about the origin of this mine states that during the winter, cold air over the hilltop sinks into rock openings in the Lock Haven Formation (Devonian age) and slowly expels the warm air that had penetrated these openings during the preceding summer. Ordinarily this process takes place locally, but here the interconnection of the rock crevices tends to be so arranged that the air circulation over a wide region is focused on one spot. Thus, from April or May to September, cold air comes in contact with percolating groundwater, forming ice during the hot months of the year; from September to late spring, warm air trapped in the rocks from the preceding summer escapes and melts the ice. Air circulation Discovered in 1894, the cave is about deep, about wide, and long. The cave was open to the public for many decades but had closed. The ice mine property was purchased by new owners who began a restoration in 2013. After being closed for nearly a quarter of a century, the Coudersport Ice Mine was re-opened in 2014.

It was first designed using different colours in 2000. It was voted as the preferred alternative New Zealand flag in the first of two New Zealand flag referendums in December 2015, and was used in the second flag referendum in a binding contest against the current New Zealand flag. Despite a UMR poll predicting that the flag would earn only 35% of the vote, the Silver Fern Flag gained a significant minority in the March 2016 referendum with 43.2% of the vote, whilst the existing flag won with 56.6% of the vote. Design and symbolism The design of the flag combines the silver fern flag (toward the hoist) with the stars of the current national flag. The silver fern frond is a popular symbol of the people of New Zealand, while the stellar constellation known as the southern cross represents the antipodean location of the country in the Southern Hemisphere. The multiple pinnates on the silver fern leaf represent New Zealand's multicultural society, a single fern spreading upwards representing one people growing into the future. Black, white and red are the national colours of New Zealand traditionally associated with the MƒÅori people, while blue is dominant in the current national flag, and symbolises the South Pacific Ocean. History File:Silver Fern flag original sketch.pngKyle Lockwood's original Silver fern flag sketch from 2000 File:Kyle Lockwood's New Zealand Flag.svgKyle Lockwood's prototype Silver fern flag which won a newspaper competition in 2004 File:NZ flag design Silver Fern (Black, White & Blue) by Kyle Lockwood.svgThe official Preferred Alternative New Zealand Flag voted by New Zealand in the first flag referendum The original 2000 sketch design used black in the upper left corner, and the first prototype design used red in the upper left corner, and a darker shade of blue for the main part of the flag. The blue represented the ocean, the red represented MƒÅori and also sacrifices during wartime, and the white of the fern is a reference to the \\"Land of the Long White Cloud\\" (translated from the MƒÅori \\"Aotearoa\\"). This design was first published by Lockwood in 2003, and won a competition in July 2004 run by The Hutt News. The flag appeared on Campbell Live in 2004 and won an online poll that included the present national flag. Lockwood has produced the flag in several of colour combinations and designs, including more and fewer fern fronds. Some New Zealanders believe that the current New Zealand flag is a reminder of British colonialism and does not truly represent their culture; however, those who support the current flag say that it represents the history of the country as a part of the British Empire and location in the Southern Hemisphere. Lockwood's winning entry in the New Zealand flag referendum had black instead of red, and a brighter shade of blue. This design is John Key's preferred proposal. The original red design was criticised on aesthetic grounds by Hamish Keith, Paul Henry and John Oliver. The New Zealand Herald writer Karl Puschmann called it a design for those \\"sitting on the fence\\" who didn't want much change. Members of the public had also compared it unfavourably to Weet- Bix packaging, or a merger of the Labour and National party logos. It was also likened to the design of a beach towel. however Lockwood pointed out that most national flags were made into beach towels. The Royal New Zealand Air Forces 3 Squadron complained that the flag was a copyright violation of their 2010 insignia until the Air Force discovered that Lockwood's flag preceded their insignia by many years.Sir 267x267px Prominent New Zealanders, including former Governor General Dame Catherine Tizard, All Black Dan Carter, Olympian Ian Fergusson, cricketing great Sir Richard Hadlee, Olympic athlete Sir Peter Snell, Mahe Drysdale, and former All Black captain Richie McCaw came out in support of the alternative design. After the 2015 Rugby World Cup final between Australia and New Zealand in Twickenham, England, Richie McCaw said \\"Running out at Twickenham and seeing the two flags looking so similar. The silver fern has always been the special symbol on the All Black jersey that represents who we are as kiwis, so the new flag with a silver fern as a part of it would be a great option I believe.\\" On the subject of flag change Dame Cath Tizard said \\"We don't wear the clothes of a century ago or drive around today in Model T Fords. Our present flag served a young post-colonial country well, but the time has come to consider a change which more appropriately recognises our changed identity and confidence in ourselves.\\" After the second referendum, the flag continued to make appearances in the International media. In the first New Zealand cricket test against Zimbabwe on 28 July 2016, the flag was featured in the opening graphics sequence, The flag is also seen flying from flagpoles around New Zealand, Kip Colvey a prominent US/NZ football player, appeared in Fairfax media on 26 December 2016, in front of the flag. Lockwood's silver fern design features in the livery of the 'Electron' rocket in Rocket Lab's New Zealand space program, The first Electron rocket was scheduled to launch in late 2016. The silver fern design will also feature in the Orewa Walk of Fame in Auckland which was scheduled to be dedicated in September 2016 Versions Five versions of Lockwood's flag were included in the Flag Consideration Panel's long list for the referendums.The long list ‚Äì New Zealand Government Two of them, the original red, white and blue and the winning black, white and blue versions, reached the short list of four (later five) flags.

Located in the heart of Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, the Studio Club was run by the YWCA and housed some 10,000 women during its 59-year existence. It was the home at various times to many Hollywood celebrities, including Marilyn Monroe, Ayn Rand, Donna Reed, Kim Novak, Maureen O'Sullivan, Rita Moreno, Barbara Eden, and Sharon Tate. The building was designed in the Italian Renaissance Revival architectural style by noted California architect Julia Morgan, who also designed Hearst Castle. The Studio Club closed in 1975, and the building was used as a YWCA-run Job Corps dormitory until April 30, 2012.

Formation of the Studio Club  Photograph of Studio Club residents cleaning house, Los Angeles Times, 1927 The Hollywood Studio Club was formed in 1916. It began with a group of young women trying to break into the movies who gathered in the basement of the Hollywood Public Library to read plays. A librarian, Mrs. Eleanor Jones, worried about the young women living in cheap hotels and rooming houses with no place to study or practice their craft. Mrs. Jones solicited help from the local YWCA, and a hall was established as a meeting place. Hollywood studios and businessmen donated money to rent an old house on Carlos Avenue with space for 20 women. Mrs. Cecil B. DeMille and Mary Pickford were active in the club's operations, and Pickford later recalled, \\"Mrs. DeMille spent every day doing something for the club. And the motion picture industry supported us.\\" A newspaper article in 1919 described the club this way: \\"The club is more of a sorority, with delightful picture 'atmosphere,' than anything else, and the same happy atmosphere will pervade the new home. A dominant note is the refining touch of home life and sense of protection, with assurance of assistance, not only in material way when need arises, but in one's work, as well. Financially, many desperate cases among young women have been tided over by the Hollywood Studio Club.\\"  The \\"Studio Girl\\"  In the early 1920s, Hollywood became embroiled in scandals, including the 1921 case involving Fatty Arbuckle and his role in the death of young actress, Virginia Rappe. The image of the \\"extra girl\\", the pretty young girl who had traveled across the country to make it in the movies only to find herself the victim of exploitation, became a public relations problem for Hollywood. One industry observer wondered if extra work would ever be anything other than \\"an alibi for prostitution.\\" In order to change this negative reputation, the Hollywood studios, led by Will Hays, enacted reforms including the formation of the Central Casting Bureau in 1925 and the construction of a large new home for the Hollywood Studio Club in 1926. By opening a large \\"chaperoned, elite dormitory\\" for Hollywood's young women, the studios hoped to replace the image of sad, bedraggled and exploited \\"extra girl\\" with the image of the new \\"studio girl\\"‚Äîa smartly dressed, graceful, and genteel woman tutored in etiquette as well as the performing arts. Hays told The New York Times that he sought to \\"make the motion picture business ... a model industrial community, complete with recreation facilities, community centres, dormitories [and] matrons.\\"  Architecture and construction  Between 1923 and 1925, a widely publicized fundraising campaign was held to build the new Hollywood Studio Club. Contributions were received from Famous Players-Lasky ($10,000), Metro Goldwyn and Carl Laemmle ($5,000 each), Warner Bros. ($3,000), and Christie Comedies ($2,000). In March 1923, aviator and movie star Andree Peyre conducted an aerial acrobatic exhibition and airplane race over Hollywood to help raise funds for the new home. In February 1925, a final $5,000 donation from silent screen star Norma Talmadge allowed the group to begin construction. The organization hired architect Julia Morgan to design the new building, and a ground-breaking ceremony took place in June 1925 with Mary Pickford and Morgan in attendance. The new Hollywood Studio Club opened in May 1926, having been built at a cost of $250,000. The building was opened at a ceremony attended by 2,500 people, \\"including many of the celebrities of the motion picture world,\\" with dedication ceremonies in the afternoon and \\"dancing at midnight.\\" North wing of the Studio Club Julia Morgan designed the Studio Club in a Mediterranean style with interiors decorated in \\"pistache green, rose coral, and tan.\\" The large building has three sections‚Äîa central section with connecting wings on each side. The entrance to the center section is marked by a loggia, three archways with decorative quoins. There is also a painted frieze above the main entrance. The building includes several recurring elements from Morgan's Mediterranean style buildings, including full-length arched windows, balconies with iron balustrades, and decorative brackets. A writer in California Graphic said \\"this beautiful and spacious new building is but one more jewel in the crown of Achieved Results which this progressive and cultural little city is wearing so proudly and shows its ever increasing desire to give unstinted moral and financial support to every progressive endeavor.\\" The rooms at the Studio Club had nameplates on the doors identifying individuals who made subscriptions of at least $1000 to the building fund. There were rooms named for Douglas Fairbanks, Howard Hughes, Gloria Swanson, Jackie Coogan, and Harold Lloyd.  Operation  \\"Map of Hollywood\\" from Jan. 1927 Photoplay article showing directions to studios from Hollywood Studio Club Front entrance, 2008 The only qualification needed for admittance to the Studio Club was that the applicant had to be seeking a career in the motion picture business, whether as an actress, singer, script girl, cutter, writer, designer, dancer or secretary. Some referred to it as a sorority, and the Studio Club also offered classes in various aspects of the performing arts, as well as hosting dances, teas, dinners and occasional plays, fashion shows and stunt nights. The club also provided residents with two meals a day, sewing machines, hair driers, laundry equipment, typewriters, theater literature, practice rooms, stage and sundeck. Former resident Rosemary Breckler recalled, \\"At the Studio Club, when we had a date, he waited anxiously and almost reverently downstairs, and then, dressed like princesses, we floated down those gorgeous stairs.\\" A newspaper article in 1946 described the club this way: \\"The Hollywood Studio Club has been thought by the unknowing to be a house filled with glamour girls constantly receiving boxes of long-stemmed roses. On the other hand it has been classified as a rescue home for wayward girls. It is neither of these. The club is a comfortable sorority house possessing many of the freedoms and comforts of a man's club. It has grown in 24 years from the home for 22 girls and a white mouse into the home of 100 girls with another 100 servicewomen equally at home in the adjoining guest house.\\" Another article in 1959 referred to the club as a \\"colony\\" of students and described the atmosphere this way: \\"You may hear the wail of a clarinet, the vocal exercise of a balladeer ... and seen in a quiet corner, the silent gestures of a rehearsing ingenue with a script. But most of all there are clustered groups recounting their day ‚Äì of pounding pavements, hearing of jobs, lamenting and blessing their luck and philosophizing.\\" In 2000, Susan Spano wrote in the Los Angeles Times: \\"The handsome Italianate building, designed in 1926 by architect Julia Morgan (of Hearst Castle fame), still evokes the good old days when a mother could send her daughter to Hollywood to become a star without worrying that her offspring would go astray.\\" However, the Studio Club was not free from scandal. Actress and former Studio Club resident Virginia Sale recalled, \\"One woman, older than the rest of us, was murdered in front of the club by a boyfriend. He was an ex- serviceman or something like that. And he then killed himself.\\"  Closure  By the mid-1960s, times had changed, and the idea of a chaperoned dormitory had become dated. In 1964, the club expanded its membership to include studio secretaries, dancers, models and others working broadly in the talent field. The club was losing money, and the YWCA Greater Los Angeles considered using it for executive offices or selling it until a petition drive by residents persuaded the YWCA Greater Los Angeles to keep the facility open. By 1971, the club was forced to open its doors as a regular hotel for transient women and stopped serving meals, but it still lost money. Changes in the fire code also took a toll, as modifications needed to bring the structure up to fire code were estimated at $60,000. In 1975, the Studio Club closed its doors. At the time of the closure, the Los Angeles Times wrote: The city of Los Angeles began using it in 2018 as a 64-bed crisis housing facility for women.  Famous residents  Marilyn Monroe posed nude to earn $50 for rent money at the Studio Club. Over the years of its operation, the Studio Club was home to many budding starlets and others trying to make it in show business. Those residing at the club included: * ZaSu Pitts ‚Äì Pitts, the star of Erich von Stroheim's 1924 masterpiece, Greed, was one of the first stars to come out of the Studio Club. Von Stroheim called Pitts \\"the greatest dramatic actress.\\" Pitts later noted that \\"without the club I should have been a village dressmaker all my days.\\" * Ayn Rand ‚Äì When Ayn Rand arrived in Hollywood in 1926 to become a screenwriter, she lived at the Studio Club. Though her heavy accent and plain Russian clothes made her an \\"odd apparition\\" to the pretty, fresh actresses of the Studio Club, Rand was welcomed into the sorority. She was hired initially as an extra, at a salary of $7.50 a day, leaving the Studio Club before dawn each day to arrive at the studio at 6 a.m. for makeup and dress. While staying at the Studio Club, she met both Cecil B. DeMille and her future husband, Frank. A club resident later recalled the following story about Rand: * Maureen O'Sullivan ‚Äì Actress Maureen O'Sullivan, who played Jane in the Tarzan movies of the 1930s and early 1940s and starred in The Devil Doll, took up residence at the Studio Club when her mother brought her to Hollywood from Ireland. * Virginia Sale ‚Äì Sale, who went on to have more than 150 film and television credits, also started at the Studio Club. Years later, Sale recalled her friendship with Ayn Rand at the club in the 1920s. Though Rand largely kept to herself, Rand encouraged Sale in her writing of skits. \\"She (Rand) did the sound effects for me backstage and that was really where my one-woman show got started, right at the club. Over the years on tour I gave 3,000 performances.\\" (Sale is one of the women in the picture above shown \\"cleaning house.\\") * Diana Dill ‚Äì Diana Dill was an actress living at the Studio Club when she met Kirk Douglas, whom she married in 1943. * Marie Windsor ‚Äì Windsor, who found a niche in film noir and became known as \\"Queen of the B's\\", won two beauty pageants in Utah before driving to Hollywood to become a star. She lived at the Studio Club when she arrived in Hollywood, stayed for three years (the maximum stay period) and later returned for six more months after World War II. * Dorothy Malone ‚Äì Malone, who later received an Academy Award for her role in Written on the Wind, lived in the Studio Club in the 1940s after moving to Hollywood from Texas. She later recalled that the Studio Club was already famous as a home for aspiring young actresses. She said, \\"You had to have references and a letter from your parents just to get in. There was a long waiting list from the beginning.\\" She dated Mel Torme while living at the club and recalled being discovered by Alan Ladd while playing a Spanish girl in a showcase at the club; but when she reported to the studio without the black hair, they did not believe she was the same person. * Marilyn Monroe ‚Äì Monroe lived at the Studio Club from 1948 to 1949. She later recalled that it was to raise $50 to pay rent at the Studio Club that she posed for the famous nude photographs. She said, \\"Funny how shocked people in Hollywood were when they learned I'd posed in the nude. At one time I'd always said no when photographers asked me. But you'll do it when you get hungry enough. It was at a time when I didn't seem to have much future. I had no job and no money for the rent. I was living in the Hollywood Studio Club for Girls. I told them I'd get the rent somehow. So I phoned up Tom Kelley, and he took these two colour shots‚Äîone sitting up, the other lying down. ... I earned the fifty dollars that I needed.\\" Monroe stayed in Room 334. * Kim Novak ‚Äì Kim Novak was the biggest star to live at the Studio Club in the 1950s. When Harry Cohn, president of Columbia Pictures, signed Novak to a studio contract, he required that she not date anyone during the week and posted a studio guard outside the Hollywood Studio Club, where he required her to live. Novak moved into the Studio Club in 1953 and stayed on at the club even after she became a movie star. Another resident at the time recalled, \\"She was very neat and clean. Nobody could look more glamorous in a man's white shirt and Levi's. I remember she just couldn't bear to leave. In those years we had raised the limit of time to five years.\\" * Barbara Eden ‚Äì In the 1950s, before landing her role on I Dream of Jeannie, Eden lived at the Studio Club. Other club residents later recalled that Eden would look at the club's bulletin board and apply for every show business job available, even those that she was advised would \\"ruin\\" her career. * Sharon Tate ‚Äì Tate, who was murdered by the Manson Family in 1969, lived at the Studio Club when she began her career in Hollywood in 1963. When her aggressive roommate at the Club made lesbian advances, Tate requested a new room. * Joanne Worley ‚Äì Worley, who went on to fame in Laugh In, lived at the Studio Club in the 1960s. She recalled, \\"I remember it was a wonderful place. ... It was inexpensive, had good food and 24-hour telephone service. And on Sundays the best coffee cake I ever ate.\\" Other residents of the Studio Club included Donna Reed (star of It's A Wonderful Life and The Donna Reed Show and Oscar winner for From Here to Eternity), Rita Moreno (winner of an Academy Award in 1961 for West Side Story, a Grammy Award in 1972, a Tony Award in 1975, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2004), Linda Darnell (star of Forever Amber, Unfaithfully Yours and A Letter to Three Wives in the late 1940s), Nancy Kwan (star of The World of Suzie Wong and Flower Drum Song in the early 1960s), Barbara Rush (Golden Globe winner for It Came from Outer Space and star of The Young Philadelphians), Janet Blair (movie star in the 1940s in films including Three Girls About Town, Broadway, and Gallant Journey), Elvia Allman (voice of Clarabelle Cow in 28 Disney cartoons, the homely woman pursuing Bob Hope in Road to Singapore, Cora Dithers in the Blondie radio series, and the aggressive forelady in the chocolate candy conveyor belt episode of I Love Lucy who yells, \\"Speed'er up a little!\\"), Barbara Britton (star of Captain Kidd and The Virginian in the mid-1940s), Gale Storm (star of the 1950s television series My Little Margie and The Gale Storm Show and singer of the hit song Dark Moon), Evelyn Keyes (Scarlet O'Hara's younger sister in Gone with the Wind and real-life spouse of Charles Vidor, John Huston and Artie Shaw), Ann B. Davis (two-time Emmy Award winner as \\"Schultzy\\" in The Bob Cummings Show and housekeeper Alice in The Brady Bunch), and Sally Struthers (Gloria from All in the Family).  Recognition as historic site  The Hollywood Studio Club has been recognized as a building of significant historic importance at both the local and national level. In 1977, the Studio Club was designated a Historic-Cultural Monument (No. 175) by the City of Los Angeles. And in 1980, it was listed in the National Register of Historic Places. In 1994, an episode of Visiting... with Huell Howser featured a tour of the Hollywood Studio Club and reminiscences of several women who lived there.

The trail is wide with an asphalt surface. The trail takes its name from the former route of the Virginia Anthracite Coal and Railway Company, nicknamed the \\"Huckleberry\\", upon which the trail was constructed. The \\"Huckleberry\\" moniker was introduced by the railroad's passengers, who would pick huckleberries alongside the tracks during the railroad's frequent service interruptions and breakdowns. History Huckleberry Trail bridge over the Norfolk Southern Railway With passenger service ending in 1958 and the subsequent abandonment of the line in 1967, the former railroad right-of-way remained unused until the idea of its conversion to a pedestrian trail arose in the 1980s. In February 1990, Montgomery County approved what would be named the Huckleberry Trail as the county's first bikeway. After a successful grassroots fundraising campaign for the trail's construction, in October 1993 the Commonwealth Transportation Board awarded the Huckleberry project $453,424 towards its construction. Originally scheduled to commence construction in early 1994, delays resulting from ADA accessibility and prehistoric archaeological sites along the trail's path resulted in some adjustments to its route. Additionally, higher costs from the construction of a tunnel and enhanced emergency vehicle access caused the project to run out of its initial funds and be placed on hold. After these delays and the securing of additional funding, construction began on the initial segment between the Montgomery-Floyd Regional Library in Blacksburg and the intersection of Hightop and Merrimac Roads in Merrimac on April 5, 1996. Although the trail was used by the public before this date, it officially opened in a ribbon-cutting ceremony on December 7, 1996. Immediately following the completion of the initial phase, bidding for the construction of the second phase began with an initial completion date estimated for late 1997. However, estimated costs for the completion of the second segment came in well over budget, resulting in the project being pushed back until additional funding could be secured. With Blacksburg, Christiansburg and Montgomery County all contributing additional funding, construction of the second phase was completed in late 1998, with the ribbon- cutting ceremony occurring on December 1, 1998. The completed trail cost $1.4 million, with federal transportation grants covering about $690,000 of the total cost. On June 1, 2000, the Huckleberry Trail's success was recognized by the federal government when it was named one of the nation's 2,000 Community Millennium Trails. On June 29, 2015, the Huckleberry Trail's Renva Knowles Bridge opened, crossing over Peppers Ferry Road near the New River Valley Mall, and the path was extended south to Cambria Street in Christiansburg, with a spur connecting the Huckleberry Trail to the Christiansburg Recreation Center via Cambria Street and North Franklin Street. In 2016-2017, the section of the Huckleberry Trail between the Virginia Tech Montgomery Executive Airport and Route 460 was realigned in connection with the Southgate Connector project, which realigned the road between Virginia Tech and Route 460. The new alignment provided a more direct connection between Huckleberry Trail and the Virginia Tech campus. On June 20, 2019, a section extending to Blacksburg's Heritage Community Park was completed.  Route description  The Huckleberry Trail's trailhead in downtown Blacksburg is on Draper Road next to the Montgomery-Floyd Regional Library. It heads south out of downtown, crossing Southgate Drive on a bridge, until it reaches the edge of the Virginia Tech Montgomery Executive Airport. From there, it heads north back to Southgate Drive and the Virginia Tech campus, then runs southwest to an underpass under Route 460. South of Route 460, the path splits into two branches, one heading north to Blacksburg's Heritage Community Park and the Jefferson National Forest, the other heading south to Christiansburg. The northward branch heads northeast through the Hethwood neighborhood, crosses Prices Fork Road, and then continues north to Glade Road. North of Glade Road, it enters Heritage Community Park, which is a former farm. Paths through the park connect the Huckleberry Trail to the Jefferson National Forest's Gateway Trail. The Christiansburg branch follows Route 460 southeast to the Slate Branch of Stroubles Creek, then follows Slate Branch south to the unincorporated community of Merrimac. The trail crosses Merrimac Road and passes through the Coal Mining Heritage Park. Continuing south, it crosses over the Norfolk Southern Railway on a bridge, enters a road cut, and passes behind the New River Valley Mall. It crosses Peppers Ferry Road on the Renva Knowles Bridge and terminates at Cambria Street in Christiansburg. A trail spur continues along Cambria Street and North Franklin Street to the Christiansburg Recreation Center.  Coal Mining Heritage Park  Old mining equipment at the Coal Mining Heritage Park Near the village of Merrimac, the Huckleberry Trail passes through the Coal Mining Heritage Park, which features equipment and part of the foundations of an abandoned coal mine. The park is located on the site of the former Merrimac Mine, which closed in the 1930s. In addition to the coal mine, the site formerly hosted a coal tipple, a hotel, a general store, and residential housing for the miners. The Coal Mining Heritage Park was planned by a collaboration between the Anthropology Program at Radford University, the Montgomery County Planning Office, the Coal Mining Heritage Association of Montgomery County, and the Virginia Department of Historic Resources. It officially opened on September 9, 2000. Located within the park is the Coal Mining Loop Trail, a path which opened on November 17, 2010.  Future expansion  As of 2016, work is underway to extend the trail to Food Lion Plaza south of the Christiansburg Recreation Center, and there are future plans to extend the trail southward to Independence Boulevard near Christiansburg High School.

History   American territorial period  Luke Wright Governor General of the Philippines from February 1904 to March 1906 The Spanish regime had earlier designated Puerto Princesa, Palawan as a place where offenders sentenced to banishment were exiled, often as a death sentence due to the endemic malaria. Yet, the facility was established only during the American occupation. Governor Luke Wright authorized the establishment of a penal colony in the province or Palawan on November 16, 1904. This penal settlement, which originally comprised an area of 22 acres, served as a depository for prisoners who could not be accommodated at the Bilibid Prison in Manila. A prison facility was created by the American military in the rain forest of Puerto Princesa. Lieutenant George Wolfe, a member of the U.S. expeditionary force was the prison's first superintendent. William Cameron Forbes, in his capacity as Secretary of Commerce and Police (1904‚Äì1909), conceived of the Palawan penal colony following the model of the George Junior Republic. According to Forbes, \\"The plan is to give these prisoners an opportunity to cultivate little lots of land for good conduct and industry.\\" Three classes of colonists were established, the lowest being the newly arrived convicts, followed by a middle class living in the Home Zone on a two- hectare plot where they could build a house and live with their family, and finally the top class living in the Free Zone, also with 2 hectares of land. The first group of 61 convicts arrived in Nov. 1904, with the population reaching 313 prisoners in June 1905, and 446 in June 1908, plus 20 families. Major John R. White, Philippine Constabulary, became superintendent in Sept. 1906. Forbes directed White to establish a \\"form of self-government in the colony.\\" Under White's rule, the mortality rate due to disease dropped, as the land was drained and sanitation improved. Barracks, an administration building and parade ground were built, while cash crops and coconut trees were planted. The work squads were controlled with a system consisting of a foreman and assistant foremen. By the time he departed in Sept. 1908, White stated the 500 convicts lived under \\"moral constraints\\" and \\"interior discipline maintained without guards.\\" Carroll H. Lamb took over as superintendent, and during his 3 year tenure, self-government was established. In 1909, Justice of the Peace Courts and a Court of Last Resort were established, and by 1910, the top class of colonists could elect minor officials, police and petty officers. By 1911, with a population over 1000, Forbes stated \\"the colonists were allowed to govern themselves ‚Äì elect their own president and council, or legislature, from among the men who by good conduct and industry had earned promotion to the highest grades.\\" The Philippine Commission of the United States government passed Act No. 1723 in 1907, classifying the settlement as a penal institution. Prison escape attempts were an initial problem the colony experienced during its first 2 year, including 33 escapees on 20 Sept. 1905. Yet, through White's efforts, the settlement became a successful colony. Vocational activities included farming, fishing, forestry, and carpentry, from which the prisoners were free to choose. Japanese occupation Pedro Paje was the Iwahig Penal Colony Superintendent during the Japanese occupation. The colony had about 1700 prisoners and 45 guards and employees during WWII. At the same time, Paje led a secret Palawan Underground Force, which established communications with Palawan's guerrilla network, supplying them with food and medicine. Paje also kept tabs on the American POWs being held in Puerto Princesa. President Manuel Quezon had authorized Paje use of the prison colony inmates to carry out acts of sabotage and intelligence against the Japanese. As cover, Paje played the role of Japanese collaborator.  Land distribution  In 1955, President Ramon Magsaysay promulgated Administrative Order No. 20 which allowed the distribution of colony lands for cultivation by deserving colonists. This was implemented by the Secretary of Justice Pedro T. Tuazon. and Agriculture and Natural Resources Secretary Juan G. Rodriguez, who granted qualified colonist six hectares of land. President Carlos P. Garcia created a committee on August 16, 1959 to study the state of national prisons. The prisoners in Iwahig were divided into two groups, settlers and colonists. The settlers are prisoners whose applications for land to cultivate have been approved. Tools, dwellings and beasts of burden were furnished by the government. Expenditures incurred for their maintenance and for their families were reimbursed from the products of their farms. Settlers receive any amount of money they have loaned after the government deducts their obligations. During that time, Iwahig was subdivided into four zones or districts: Central sub-colony with an area of ; Sta. Lucia with ; Montible with and Inagawan with .  In popular culture  The Iwahig Prison is the subject of the film, Out of Bounds, by the French directors Alexandre Leborgne and Pierre Barougier, France, 2005. The film received the Grand Prix in 2006 at the EBS International Documentary Festival held by the national public television of Korea, EBS.http://www.eidf.org/2006/fall_en/sub/board.htm?table=news_en&mode;=read&no;=52&curPage;=1&col;=&str;=&rnum;=49  References  Category:Department of Justice (Philippines) Category:Prisons in the Philippines Category:Buildings and structures in Puerto Princesa Category:National Historical Landmarks of the Philippines Category:Farms in the Philippines ","title":"Iwahig Prison and Penal Farm"},{"id":"17629090","text":"Lasse Braun and Brigitte Maier 1976 Sensations is a 1975 pornographic film written by Veronique Monet, directed by Lasse Braun, and starring the writer and Brigitte Maier.

It is located in the capital of the province, Novi Sad. The current president of VANU is Endre Pap. Foundation Vojvodinian Academy of Sciences and Arts (VANU) was founded in 1979. The modern academy was founded as a group of citizens on October 23, 2003 by a decree of Nenad ƒåanak, the then President of the Assembly of Vojvodina. Since December 15, 2009, it has been recognized as an academic institution that is functioning in AP Vojvodina. It was de jure unrecognized as an academic institution by authorities until December 15, 2009,when it was officially constituted by Assembly of Vojvodina. By the new statute of Vojvodina its status has been resolved. Purpose VANU is the academy of the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina. Its main aim is to transmit traditions in sciences and arts of the multicultural and multiethnic area through cooperation with other academies and institutions. Its secondary goal is to improve living conditions in the Vojvodina region by using the spiritual and natural resources of Vojvodina. VANU as a regional academy with ambition to grow into a mid-European one. It is oriented to the value system of the area and surroundings in which it acts, starting with certain principles. It sees globalization as unavoidable with respect to the standards of scientific and technological development but it has to preserve the values of the area, nation and their cultures and traditions in so far as they are in accordance with humanism and tolerance. Controversy The organization has come into conflict with the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (SANU). After the original VANU (1974-1992) ceased operating, its property and members were absorbed into SANU to the dissatisfaction of some members. According to statement issued by VANU, it also came into conflict with ultra-nationalistic organizations whose identities remain unknown. Some members even received letters of death threats from self-proclaimed 'patriotic' groups in Serbia.

Overview Chungking was set in motion by the basement-based musical tinkerings of Sean Hennessey and his friend James Stephenson. The pair eventually decided to obtain a vocalist and discovered that Hennessey's then-girlfriend, Jessie Banks, could sing. Together they spent some time writing music and demoing songs, some of which made their way to Japan where a Tokyo DJ cut part of the demo CD onto 12\\" records. One of these records landed in the hands of the owner of Tummy Touch Records with the Japanese label reading \\"beautiful Chungking music\\" (From where the band eventually got its name). The owner tracked the band down and persuaded them to finish their album. Their first album We Travel Fast was released under Tummy Touch Records in 2003. Chungking then released the album \\"The hungry years\\" in 2004 which was a modified version of \\"We Travel Fast\\" In 2007 the album \\"Stay Up Forever\\" was released by Gut Records. Chungking then took some time out from making records and wrote primarily for T.V. and advertising. Songs were featured on programmes such as Nip/Tuck, Grey's Anatomy and Ugly Betty.

It had a seating capacity of 3,748, twice the size of many theaters. Ticket prices ranged from 25¬¢ for a seat in the gallery to $1.50 for one in the orchestra. The venue was founded by John Koster Albert Bial in the late 19th century and closed in 1901.  History  The music hall featured many top performers of its day and is famous in cinema history as the site of the first public exhibition of the Vitascope on April 23, 1896.Ramsaye, Terry (1926), A Million and One Nights: A History of the Motion Picture Through 1926, Simon and Schuster Essandess paperback reprint, 1964.

That earlier establishment was located on 23rd Street. At that location, Koster and Bial had taken over Bryant's Opera House, a venue for minstrel shows. They offered food and drink along with vaudeville, circumventing a law against serving alcohol in theatres by replacing the curtain with a folding fan., p. 128, includes photo of theatre The last Koster and Bial's Music Hall originated when they moved uptown into the former Manhattan Opera House, a huge theatre built in Herald Square in 1892 by Oscar Hammerstein I in pursuit of his passion for grand opera. Quickly running into financial problems, Hammerstein decided to convert his theatre to a vaudeville format. He offered Koster and Bial a partnership under which he would manage the entertainment and they would manage the food. The new Koster and Bial's Music Hall opened on August 28, 1893 and proved to be very successful. Hammerstein however quarreled with his partners and lawsuits ensued. Ultimately Koster and Bial bought out Hammerstein and operated the theater solely on their own., Volume 48, Issue 7 The theatre finally closed in 1901 and was demolished to make way for Macy's Department Store.

The turret is neatly covered with ... blue velvet brocade... The moving figures are about half life size. :...a buzzing and roaring were heard in the turret, and an unusually bright light fell upon the screen.

Elena was a central figure in Wilson's life from the time they met until his death in 1972. She was the literary executrix of his estate and helped Leon Edel edit her husband's journals. She also edited a book of his literary correspondence.Helen Miranda Wilson Family Born Helene-Marthe Mumm von Schwarzenstein in Reims, France, Elena Mumm was the daughter of Peter Arnold Maximilian Hermann Georg Mumm von Schwarzenstein and Olga de Struve. On her father's side, she was descended from a long line of ancient Prussian nobility, traceable to 1359 in Cleves, Prussia. On March 31, 1873, Kaiser Wilhelm I renewed the Mumm patent on nobility, conferring the ‚ÄúMumm von Schwarzenstein.‚Äù Elena's branch had been famed for its champagne and white wine production, with estates founded in Reims, France, in 1827 and in the famous terroir Johannisberg, Germany (where Riesling was produced) in 1822. Her father was head of the internationally famous champagne company \\"Mumm Co.\\" until the French seized the family's French properties and brand name after World War I as spoils of war. Her father continued making wine in Germany until his death in 1937.Eventually, in the 1960s, the family sold the rights to the vineyards. See Mumm family citation in Almanach de Gotha: 1930‚Äì45 On her paternal side, Elena was related to the Barons von Radowitz and Barons von Rotenhan, as well as the Grunelius and Passavant families, powerful industrialists and bankers. One of the family banks was a founding member of a banking consortium that would grow to become the Swiss Bank Corporation, now merged into UBS AG, the world's largest manager of private wealth assets.See history of Swiss Bank Corporation: www.ubs.com Her uncle, Baron Walther von Mumm, was a sportsman, Don Juan and bon vivant who enjoyed racing hot air balloons and even filled in on the German bobsled team at the 1932 Olympic Games. Her mother was a daughter of Karl de Struve, who served at different times as the Russian Ambassador to Japan, the United States,Genealogisches Handbuch des Adels. Published 1958 and the Netherlands. The de Struve family descended from a long line of famed astronomers, the first of whom moved to Russia during Czar Peter I the Great‚Äôs cultural and scientific revolution. By the fifth generation, they had married into prominent Russian imperial families and European aristocracy: most prominent of Elena's great-aunts and great-uncles were the Vicomte Eugene Melchior de Vog√º√©, philosopher and author; Victor, Prince Galitzine; and General Michael Nicolaivitch Annenkoff, Governor General of Trans-Caspia, 'conqueror' of Bokhara, and builder of the Transcaucasia railroad. Elena's second great-grandfather, General Nicholas Annenkov, was Comptroller General of the Russian Imperial Court.See writings of Melchior, Vicomte de Vogue 1890‚Äì1900 Her mother was born in Japan and with her four siblings grew up there, and in St Petersburg, The Hague, and Washington, D.C. . Her mother's siblings included Princess Vera Mestchersky, Countess Elena Orlov, and Boris de Struve, a Russian attach√© to Washington who married an American, Maxine Slater. Her mother left Russia in 1904 to marry her father, whereas her aunts returned to Russia to marry. After the Russian Revolution, they ended up in Paris as part of the √©migr√© community. Early life With such wealth and cultural advantages, Elena enjoyed a privileged childhood. She and her siblings were educated by private tutors, and she spoke and wrote fluent German, French, English, and some Russian.

However, by 1933, Sir Henry had been forced to resign his position and lost most of his wealth. He moved to New York City, where he later died of complications from surgery. James and Elena followed Sir Henry to New York. James then went off to war in Europe. Cut off from her husband and her family in Germany and living in reduced circumstances, Elena took various jobs. When she became a secretary for the editor of Town and Country magazine, she worked her way up to the position of assistant editor. Elena met Edmund Wilson when he submitted a piece which she edited. He was at that time separated from his third wife, Mary McCarthy. They fell deeply in love, went to Reno, Nevada, divorced their respective spouses, and remarried there in December, 1946, when he was 51 and she was 40.

Her lifelong, omnivorous reading habits in three languages and her deep understanding of history and literature made her a most valuable first reader of all that Wilson wrote while he was with her. Starting in 1946, both of them lived in Wellfleet, year-round for the most part, until their deaths. They had a daughter, Helen Miranda, in 1948. The rural community was small but mixed, including many artists and writers and a seasonal influx of sophisticated professionals who came for the summer.

After taking off for a flight to Perm, it turned back due to a fire on board and crashed 11 km from the airport, killing all nine crew members. Background The aircraft, registered RA-12957 (cn 88345508), was built in 1968. After transporting a cargo of cash from Moscow to Chelyabinsk, it was operating as an empty flight numbered GAI9675 to Perm. Flight During the pre-takeoff checklist, the crew noted warnings about a power supply failure in engines 1 and 2, but ignored them, as recorded by the CVR: *Flight radio operator: \\"Sanya.\\" (name of the engineer) *Flight engineer: \\"Yes?\\" *Flight radio operator: \\"Number two failed\\" *Instructor pilot: \\"And number one too\\" *Flight radio operator: \\"Alternator\\" *A crew member: \\"Screw it\\" *Flight radio operator: \\"Here we go\\" The investigation team concluded that \\"here we go\\" probably referred to successful reactivation of the alternators by the radio operator. The flight took off at 14:03 from Runway 09. At 14:03:55, the captain asked \\"What's the matter?\\". The flight engineer responded \\"doors open\\". It is unclear whether he was referring to the cargo doors or chassis doors, but the final report states that it was probably the chassis doors. The investigation found that the doors were closed at the time of the crash, and the false alarm was one of the first signs of problems in the power lines in the aircraft. Another warning sounded 6 seconds later: \\"Too low, gear\\". This was erroneous, as the aircraft was climbing, and this warning can be triggered only during descent. At 14:04:09, other crew members in the cabin advised the pilots about the fire. *Captain: \\"Come on, have a quick look... take a look what's going on there\\" *Flight radio operator: \\"Let's land maybe, or... OK, requesting\\" *Captain: \\"Wait, wait\\" *First officer: \\"My attitude indicator failed\\" *Captain: \\"Got it, taking control\\" At this point, the aircraft was at 470 m altitude and turning left. At 14:04:28, the captain decided to turn back to Chelyabinsk. The crew contacted ATC and requested priority landing due to smoke in the cockpit. The weather was cloudy, ceiling 90‚Äì100 m, visibility 1,100 m. CVR recordings showed that the pilots discussed further failures of multiple systems, as well as multiple false failure alarms. They also stated that the source of fire was in the cargo section, and considered depressurizing the cabin. A trim failure warning was triggered at 14:07:15, and at 14:08, engine dislodging indicators were also triggered. The flight engineer warned the crew to operate the throttle slowly. At 14:09:13, while the aircraft was turning left, engine 2 became unstable. Moments later, multiple fuses went off. At 14:09:54, engines 1 and 2 stopped due to fuel starvation. The cockpit voice recorder then stopped working, and the flight data recorder began to malfunction. At 14:10:21, the captain started turning for the final approach. With only two engines operating, the plane's speed fell to 280 km/h, the minimum permitted without flaps. Engine 3 was operating at 20%, and engine 4 was throttled back to 85%. Beginning at 14:10:40, the aircraft began to bank heavily left (to 32¬∞). It began descending at 14:10:48. At 14:10:43, the crew contacted the control tower and reported, \\"Gromov 9675, on landi... turning to final, 400, approaching, continuing approach\\". This was the crew's final transmission. At 31 m above the ground, the aircraft clipped a high-voltage power line with its left wing. The aircraft then crashed in a field at 14:10:56, 11 km from Runway 09. Vertical speed at the time of impact was 5000 fpm. Investigation An investigation concluded that during the last fifteen seconds of flight, the crew was unable to effectively operate the ailerons. Medical experts ruled out incapacitation due to smoke inhalation, meaning that the pilots could not operate the ailerons because of mechanical failure caused by the fire. A fire also broke out after the crash. Because of the fire on the crash site, the investigation could not determine the exact location of the fire in the electrical system that caused the accident. The flight recorders were found severely damaged, but usable. The final report states the following reason of the accident: > The aviation incident with An-12 aircraft registered RA-12957 occurred as a > result of impact with ground caused by lost control over the aircraft due to > the destruction of aileron control wires during an emergency approach for > landing because of smoke in the cabin. [...] Aileron control wires were > destroyed most probably due to significant heating of nearby steel wires and > subsequent breaking under operating load. The heating may have been caused > by an in-flight fire of nearby power lines, which is evidenced by smoke in > the cabin, unexpected triggering of multiple warnings, equipment failures, > and the failure of two engines. Crew The captain had 14,928 hours of flying experience, and the navigator had 11,021 hours. Both of them had no prior incidents.

In the aquarium Ember tetras should be kept in acidic water with a pH near 6.6, and although their native habitat has very soft water they have adapted quite well to a wide range of hardness (5‚Äì17 dGH). The recommended temperature range is between 23‚Äì29 C (73‚Äì84 F). Ideally their tank should contain live plants, a darker substrate, and open water for swimming. Ember tetras should be kept in groups of at least 9-10, in order to promote schooling. They appreciate a heavily planted aquarium, ideally with a small area shaded from direct light and will spend a lot of time swimming through planted areas, which also offer some protection for their fry. Ember tetras will school with other tetras, such as the neon tetra, but may become stressed by the presence of significantly larger fish. These fish swim at the middle level of the aquarium, and they don't feed from the bottom of the tank. Therefore, it is recommended that they are kept with other bottom dwelling fish (such as pygmy corydoras) so that leftover food is then eaten up off the substrate and not left to waste. Ember tetras can be fed a variety of foods, including flake, frozen, and freeze dried food. Small live foods like worms and brine shrimp are also recommended as they bring out the fish's colors. In a well maintained heavily planted aquarium, Ember tetras have been known to live ten years or more.

He acted on his own and also led a bandit gang, operating particularly in the Rocky Mountains and Indian Territory. Reed is claimed to have been the last survivor of the \\"47 most notorious outlaws\\" of Indian Territory.Haile, Bartee. \\"This Week in Texas: Old West relic dies in his sleep\\", Diboll Free Press, January 2, 2008. Accessed June 3, 2008. \\"Texas Jack started the new century by turning over a new leaf. Trading his sixguns for a Bible, he preached the gospel as an itinerant evangelist.\\" He became an evangelist in his later years, and could often be seen on the streets of Tulsa preaching against the dangers of following a \\"life of crime\\".\\"Texas Jack, 87, Once Southwest Outlaw\\", The New York Times, January 9, 1950. \\"The penitent badman then became an evangelist and toured the country with a wagon and team of horses\\" His memoirs were published in the 1930s, and are considered valuable collectors' items (one copy was reportedly sold on the internet for $1,500 in 2007). He claimed to have ridden with the Dalton gang, Bill Doolin, Henry Starr and other outlaws and bandits of the old west. He may have also helped Cherokee Bill, a fellow outlaw from the Indian Territory, in his escape from Fort Smith during the 1880s. As with many others of the era, Reed's colorful stories of his almost 10-year career as an outlaw were probably exaggerated by later writers. He claimed to have ridden briefly with the Daltons, and participated in their dual bank robberies in Coffeyville in 1892, as well as in the infamous 1893 gunfight at Ingalls. However, there is no corroborating evidence that he was involved in either of those events. Biography Early life Reed was born in Madison County, Arkansas. His father, Mason Henry Reed, was killed in action fighting for the Union Army during the American Civil War, probably at the Battle of Campbell's Station on November 16, 1863. His mother was Sarah Elizabeth Prater. Reed lived with a number of relatives, including his maternal grandparents, until 1883 when, at the age of 21, he moved to the American frontier.Wilson, R. Michael. Great Train Robberies of the Old West. Guilford, Connecticut: Globe Pequot, 2007. (pp. 94‚Äì101) He worked at various jobs in Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado, Texas until he reached Oklahoma, where he became a ranch hand for the Tarry outfit. During the summer of 1885, his foreman recruited him to rob a train at La Junta, Colorado. In the course of the robbery, Reed entered the passenger car firing his pistol to keep the passengers under control. He later received $6,000 for his part in the hold up. Encouraged by this success, Reed gave up working as a cowboy and became an outlaw. During the next nine years he and his gang robbed trains, stagecoaches, banks and, on one occasion, captured a large shipment of bullion in California.Drago, Harry Sinclair. The Organized Bands of Bank and Train Robbers Who Terrorized the Prairie Towns of Missouri, Kansas, Indian Territory and Oklahoma for Half a Century. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1998. (pg. 195‚Äì199) Robbery at Blackstone Switch During the early 1890s, when he was living near Muskogee, Oklahoma, Reed learned that a gold shipment was leaving Dallas, Texas on November 13, 1894. He recruited Buz Luckey, William \\"Will\\" Smith and Tom Root, and selected Blackstone Switch at Wybark as the site for the robbery. The plan was for Reed to throw the switch as the train approached then, as it entered onto a sidetrack, the gang would use dynamite to enter the express car. Root, a full-blooded Cherokee known for his size and strength, would enter the express car, break open the strong boxes, and bring out the gold. Smith would hold a gun on the engineer and fireman while Luckey stayed with the horses. Despite their practice staged-robbery the previous day, as the Katy No. 2 approached, Reed threw the switch too early. Engineer Joseph Hotchkiss stopped the train when he saw the signal light change, far short of the siding. Reed and the others were forced to run towards the train yelling and shooting. Hotchkiss and the fireman alerted the messengers using the bell cord connected to the car and jumped off the train to hide in a small ravine nearby. The railroad company had anticipated the possibility of a robbery, and had moved the gold to another train, putting in its place several armed messengers to guard the express car including Bud Ledbetter, Paden Tolbert, Sid Johnson, Frank Jones. When Reed and the others approached the express car, he called for the messengers to leave the car. When they refused, Reed and Root took cover behind some trees and began shooting into the car. The messengers returned fire, resulting in a gunfight that lasted for nearly an hour. Eventually one of Reed's men was killed; Reed jumped onto the train and went through the passenger cars forcing passengers to put their valuables into a sack before he and his gang fled. As they rode away, Reed was shot by Bud Ledbetter; the pain from his wound grew so severe that his partners were forced to leave him behind for the night. He gave them some of his loot, and kept the rest of it in a sack to use as a pillow. He lay on a blanket hiding under a rock ledge until he was found by an Indian woman, who nursed him back to health. The American Express Company offered a reward of $250 for the arrest and conviction of each member of the gang. An extensive manhunt was conducted by U.S. Marshals George Crump and S. Morton Rutherford, and large groups of deputies were sent into the Indian Territory and Creek Nation. While burning the canebrakes in the Verdigris bottoms, one deputy found the burnt remains of Reed's saddle and threatened to destroy the crops of local residents if they did not turn over Reed and his men. This was considered a legal act, authorized by \\"The Hanging Judge\\" Isaac Parker himself, but no one came forward with information. Reed was warned of the search and decided to leave the territory as soon as he was able. He arrived in Seneca, Missouri on December 9, where Bill Lawrence took care of him. Once fully recovered from his wounds Reed returned to Arkansas in February 1895, where he stayed with his brother in Madison County. Having decided to retire from a life of crime, he wrote to Judge Isaac Parker, agreeing to testify against the man who planned the robbery in exchange for probation, although he did not participate in the proceedings. Smith managed to disappear, but U.S. Marshal Newton LaForce was successful in tracking down Luckey and Root to the latter's home in Broken Arrow, 15 miles south of Tulsa, Oklahoma. The two fugitives were subsequently killed in a gunfight with LaForce and his men on December 4, 1894. Later years Despite Parker's promise of immunity, Reed was convicted and sentenced to serve five years in prison. However, he served less than one, as shortly before his own death Parker granted Reed his parole, in November 1896. Reed subsequently carried his signed parole from Judge Parker around with him, along with a letter signed by Ledbetter acknowledging that Ledbetter had shot him. After his release Reed became an evangelist, preaching the rewards of living a respectable, law-abiding life. He also toured the country with a series of Wild West shows. His memoirs, The Life of Texas Jack, were published in 1936, and 35,000 copies of several published pamphlets and dime novels describing his life as an outlaw were sold before his death at home in Tulsa, Oklahoma, at the age of 87. He was buried in St. Paul, Arkansas. References Further reading Books *Croy, Homer. He Hanged Them High: An Authentic Account of the Fanatical Judge who Hanged Eighty-Eight Men.

He was one of four children and grew up in Clay County, Alabama.Willa Cockrell's Obituary, Rootsweb.com He attended Clay County High School and later earned a degree in Aeronautical Engineering from Auburn University. In 1957, he married Hazel Goodman of Lineville, Alabama. They eventually had four children, daughters, Julie and Gwendolyn, and sons, Jeffrey and Bruce.Hazel Cockrell's Obituary, Acenstors.com Career Redesigned Clamp-Type 2C1.5-4 Rocket Motor used for remote testing Cockrell's career took his family across the United States, including Alabama, Utah, Texas, and Virginia. Redstone Arsenal, Alabama Breathing apparatus (October 1959). Great measures were taken to mitigate danger however, all employees and soldiers had to be prepared for the worse when working with rockets. In April 1949, the Rohm and Haas Company signed a contract with the U.S. Army Missile Command near Redstone Arsenal to do research and development work on rockets and jet propulsion. After graduating from Auburn University, Cockrell began his career in Redstone Arsenal's Research Division. Cockrell and other staff often served as consultants to the Army Laboratories and other companies. They contributed to many programs including Polaris, Poseidon, Pershing, and Minuteman.Charles E. Thies, A Personal History of the Rohm and Hass Company's Redstone Research Laboratories at Redstone Arsenal, Alabama (1996), American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc. Cockrell focused on reducing motor sizes to accommodate the trend in propellant research. Several factors drove this trend to include: * Many researchers had an upper restriction on propellant quantity * Increasing toxicity and/or sensitivity of new formulations * Limited availability or cost of novel propellant ingredients Before the new, smaller motors could even be built, Cockrell and team had to completely redesign the motor hardware to allow them to be remotely fired. These innovative, new motor designs also had to consider the stress on the hardware especially since it was going be evaluating very hazardous materials. Due to the hazardous nature of the propellants, Cockrell had to design casting equipment and facilities that could be operated remotely. These included two facilities to handle up 250 grams and one to handle up to 2 pounds of propellant; both of which had closed-circuit television cameras to provide close-up views of the equipment and controls. Cockrell's research also showed that rocket efficiency could be scaled when corrections were made for heat-loss and two-phase-flow effects. These scaling factors could be used to accurately predict the specific impulse of the propellant in any other untested motor configuration. The specific impulse is the most important metric for the efficiency of a rocket engine. This metric is defined as impulse per unit of propellant and is either measured as a speed (V_{e} in meters/second or ft/s) or as a time (seconds). Vought Systems Division, Dallas, Texas In 1972, Vought Aeronautics and Vought Missiles and Space were combined into Vought Systems.Vought Heritage (1973-1982) Website While working for Vought Systems in Texas, Cockrell conducted design and analysis to define a detailed configuration capable of meeting the stringent performance, structural, and mass properties requirements set forth in their new government contract.Byron L.

The work culminated in the fabrication of a complete prototype. The M270 MLRS conducts a rocket launch. Cockrell's expertise also served Vought Systems when they became the prime contractor for the development of the Scout launch vehicle which were to place small satellites into orbit around the Earth. Scout, an acronym for Solid Controlled Orbital Utility Test system, was a four-stage solid fuel satellite system capable of launching a 385-pound satellite into a 500-mile orbit.John Pike, Scout (April 1997), Fas.org WebsiteNASA's Scout Launch Vehicle , NASA Facts Online, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Since 1976, its launch success rate was 100 percent and included 23 satellites launched for the international space organizations. Much of his work in Texas remains classified. However, because of his expertise and time frame; Cockrell was more than likely involved in the Army's Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) program. Vought was awarded a contract to conduct design and trade-off analysis and system optimization of the MLRS in 1976.MLRS History , Redstone Arsenal One year later, the MLRS design was complete and production began in 1980. Atlantic Research Corporation, Virginia While working for Atlantic Research Corporation (now Aerojet) in Virginia, Cockrell served as a program director. His leadership, experience, and expertise served several programs well to include the Minuteman program. During this time, he was recognized as an Associate Fellow by the esteemed American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA).AIAA Recipient List According to Article III 3.2, of the AIAA's Constitution:  Personal life  Despite his stressful schedule and according to his sons, he always made time to spend with his family to include vacations and outings. According to his sons, he enjoyed being part of their projects but insisted on incorporating technology to gain a competitive edge. One such instance involved the use graphite and advanced aerodynamic concepts in a soap box derby, which of course were beyond the abilities of the other children and their parents. After retirement, he remained in Virginia where he spent time with his children, three grandsons and six granddaughters.

He is the chairman, CEO, and sole owner of Landry's, Inc., one of the largest restaurant corporations in the U.S. He also owns the National Basketball Association (NBA)'s Houston Rockets. In 2018, his net worth was estimated at $4.5 billion, placing him at No. 153 on the Forbes 400 list of the wealthiest Americans; Forbes calls him the \\"World's Richest Restaurateur\\". Fertitta is chairman of the board of regents of the University of Houston System. Fertitta became the star of Billion Dollar Buyer on CNBC. On September 5, 2017, Fertitta reached an agreement to buy the Houston Rockets for $2.2 billion. Early life Fertitta was born and raised in Galveston, Texas, several generations after his family had emigrated to Texas from Sicily. His father, Vic, owned a seafood restaurant on Galveston Island, and after school, Tilman would peel shrimp in his father's restaurant. Fertitta attended Texas Tech University and the University of Houston, studying business administration and hospitality management. His first entrepreneurial experience involved selling and promoting Shaklee vitamins. In the 1980s, Fertitta founded and ran a construction and development business, and developed his first major project, the Key Largo Hotel in Galveston. Business ventures Landry's, Inc. Fertitta was a partner in the first Landry's Restaurant, Landry's Seafood, which opened its doors in the Houston suburb of Katy, Texas, in 1980. A year later, he helped open Willie G's Seafood & Steaks, a more upscale restaurant in Uptown Houston. In 1986, Fertitta gained controlling interests of both locations, and in 1988, became sole owner of Landry's Restaurants. In 1993, he took Landry's, Inc. public and the company grew quickly, adding concept after concept. In 2004, Fertitta was elected to the Texas Business Hall of Fame, becoming the second-youngest Texan to ever earn that distinction, behind only Michael Dell. In 2010, Fertitta, who already owned the majority of Landry's, Inc. stock, purchased all outstanding shares, becoming sole owner again. In 1993, the company was valued at approximately $30 million. By 2011, the company's value had skyrocketed to a value of more than $1.7 billion. As of 2013, the company, under the leadership of Fertitta, owns and operates more than 500 restaurant/entertainment/gaming/hospitality locations. In total, Landry's, Inc. employs more than 50,000 people and controls $3.2 billion in assets. His portfolio includes: The Golden Nugget Hotel and Casinos; Morton's The Steakhouse; Rainforest Cafe; Bubba Gump Shrimp Co.; McCormick & Schmick's Seafood & Steaks; Saltgrass Steak House; Claim Jumper; Chart House; The Oceanaire; Mastro's Restaurants; Grotto Restaurants, The Boathouse Restaurants and Vic & Anthony's Steakhouse. In 2017 he acquired half of EMM group, owner of the Catch Restaurants. Hotels Fertitta first built the Key Largo Hotel in Galveston, Texas to buy the rights to Landry's. After acquiring restaurants under the company, Fertitta started focusing more on the hospitality division of Landry's and acquired the San Luis Resort, Spa, & Conference Center in Galveston, Texas. He also partnered with the City of Galveston to build the conference center in 2004 inside the resort. Fertitta since acquired two additional hotels on the island, including the Holiday Inn On the Beach in 2003, and the Hilton Galveston Island Resort in 2004, which stands adjacent to his San Luis Resort. In 2015, Fertitta added the Villas at San Luis section of the hotel, which consists of ultra-luxury villas with direct access to both the beach and the hotel's pool.Beachfront Hotel & Spa - Galveston Hotel - Texas Beach Resort, SanLuisResort.com; accessed May 23, 2017.History of Landry's Restaurants, Inc., FundingUniverse; accessed May 23, 2017. Casinos Golden Nugget Lake Charles in Lake Charles, Louisiana Landry's first expanded to casinos in 2005 when it bought Golden Nugget Casinos, including locations in Las Vegas and Laughlin, Nevada. Since then, Landry's has opened casinos in Atlantic City, New Jersey; Biloxi, Mississippi; and Lake Charles, Louisiana. The Golden Nugget Atlantic City was previously called the Trump Marina. Fertitta purchased this casino from Trump Entertainment Resorts in 2011. The Golden Nugget Lake Charles was bought after Fertitta found a license and resort land for sale from Pinnacle Entertainment, which owns the adjacent L'Auberge du Lac Resort. Fertitta stated he built the casino with the idea of having a casino in close proximity to his Houston hometown. After the first year proved the casino was successful, a new 300 room tower began construction on the property. Entertainment In addition to restaurants, hotels, and casinos, Landry's also owns amusement parks, aquariums, and the Kemah Boardwalk. Landry's, Inc. first acquired the Kemah Boardwalk in 1999. After acquiring the boardwalk, Fertitta added a few Landry's restaurants, and a few rides. In 2007, he added the Boardwalk Bullet which is a high speed wooden roller coaster. He also added the Boardwalk Fanta Sea, which is a luxury yacht cruise service where guests ride along the Galveston Bay. The marina on the boardwalk is the largest concentration of boats and yachts in Greater Houston, as well as one of the largest in the nation. The boardwalk also includes an aquarium, which is under the same Landry's line of aquarium restaurants with locations in Houston, Denver, and Nashville. Travel + Leisure magazine named the Kemah boardwalk a top 10 American boardwalk.Travel + Leisure America's Best Beach boardwalks, travelandleisure.com; accessed May 23, 2017. In 2000, Landry's acquired the land on the 400 block of Bagby in Downtown Houston. The deal came from a proposal of the City of Houston to redevelop the fire station. After redeveloping the building, the aquarium added the shark tank and restaurant before opening in 2003. Fertitta redeveloped the pleasure pier in Galveston, Texas, after the pier had closed after damages by Hurricane Ike. The pier reopened in 2012 as the Galveston Island Historic Pleasure Pier. The redeveloped pier includes an amusement park, Bubba Gump Shrimp Company restaurant, as well as shops. Sports In 2003, Fertitta bought the naming rights to the Crawford Boxes at Minute Maid Park. =Texans= During the process of building the Houston Texans as an NFL team, Fertitta was one of the original investors in creating the franchise. He was a partner of Texans owner Bob McNair until 2008 when he had to sell his interest in the franchise because he owns the Golden Nugget casino chain (a Landry's subsidiary) and NFL rules state any staff member of a team cannot be associated with gambling. Both Fertitta and McNair were disappointed, as Fertitta was part of the franchise since its establishment. =Astros= In 2003, Fertitta bought the naming rights to the Crawford Boxes seating section of Minute Maid Park, calling it \\"Landry's Crawford Boxes\\". The term has become a commercial moniker during radio and television broadcasts. A Landry's sign is placed above the section, along with many of the company's subsidiaries. Traditionally, when a fan catches a home run, they are awarded a gift certificate to one of Landry's restaurants. Landry's promoters often visit the section and give away items such as T-shirts. =Rockets= On September 4, 2017, he agreed to purchase the Rockets from Leslie Alexander, pending league approval, for an NBA record $2.2 billion. On October 6, 2017 Fertitta was approved by the NBA to own the Houston Rockets. Fertitta paid for the Rockets by selling $1.415 billion worth of bonds and was competing with Houston-native singer Beyonce Knowles to purchase the team. By buying the Houston Rockets he also became the owner of Clutch Gaming, a professional eSports organisation focused on League of Legends.

Early life  Frank was born into a Croatian Jewish family, but converted to Catholicism at the age of 18 \\"Eugen Dido Kvaternik, Sjeƒáanja i zapa≈æanja 1925-1945, Prilozi za hrvatsku povijest.\\", Dr. Jere Jareb, Starƒçeviƒá, Zagreb, 1995., , str. 267.: Josip Frank pokr≈°ten je, kad je imao 18 godina. and attended the gymnasium in Osijek. After having finished his law studies at the Vienna University in 1868, he moved to Zagreb in 1872 and worked as an attorney at law.  Political career  Frank's initial political involvement included a critique of the People's Party (of Josip Juraj Strossmayer), joining the opinion of ban Levin Rauch. When Ivan Ma≈æuraniƒá became Croatian ban in 1873, Frank criticized him because of his relations with the Magyars and the Serbs. In 1877, he founded the newspapers Agramer Presse and Kroatische Post, which were soon banned by the Austro-Hungarian authorities. In 1880, Frank published a brochure titled Die Quote Kroatiens, in which he tried to prove that Croatia bore a disproportionately high financial burden since the 1868 Nagodba (Compromise), a legal arrangement that regulated the constitutional position of Croatia within the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In 1880, Frank was elected to the Zagreb City council, where he would serve until 1894. In 1880, the Croatian poet August ≈†enoa characterised Frank in the following manner: \\"The infamous Zagreb attorney ... degrades and befouls all that is Croatian, first to the benefit of the Magyars, now of the Austrians ... Frank is a political louse, who served Rauch, then the Swabian Generalkommando ... he offered himself to the Orthodox voter in Pakrac, bragging about ... protecting Serbian interests.\\" In 1884, Frank was elected as an independent delegate to the Croatian Sabor, representing the Kotar of Popovaƒça. In 1887, he was elected to represent the Kotar of Vojni Kri≈æ. In 1890, supported by Fran Folnegoviƒá, he joined Ante Starƒçeviƒá's Croatian Party of Rights, soon advancing to the highest ranks of the party. Frank became instrumental in the writing of the political programme of the Party of Rights, published on June 6, 1894. In 1895, after an incident in which students from Zagreb publicly burned the Hungarian flag in front of Emperor Franz Joseph, a rift formed in the party as Folnegoviƒá and others condemned that act. Shortly afterwards, and shortly before Starƒçeviƒá died, Frank persuaded Starƒçeviƒá to split off his fraction to form the Pure Party of Rights () with its mouthpiece Hrvatsko pravo. By 1897, Frank had become the true leader of the Croatian states' rights movement, advancing to president of the party after Starƒçeviƒá's death. Frank's Party of Rights was opposed to the Party of Rights led by Frano Supilo and other advocates of the policy of a \\"New Course\\", of alignment towards Serbs. Frank maintained an interest in financial matters, which earned him a regular place in the Croatian Parliament's finance committee, and later in the budget committee. He was a member of the board of financial matters of the Kingdom of Croatia between 1898 and 1906. In 1898, he published a treatise called Nuncij where he harshly accused Hungary for a perceived injustice in the financial terms of the settlement between Croatia and Hungary. In 1904 Frank reiterated his demands for a financial independence of Croatia, and in part due to his efforts, in 1906 a new financial agreement between Croatia and Hungary was formed which was considered the most beneficial to the Croatian side. One of the most important characteristics of the Frank's followers was their anti-Serb position. After Peter I Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá came to power in Serbia in 1903, Frank's attention increasingly turned to opposing any rapprochement with the Serbs, unlike the majority opinion represented by the Croato-Serbian Coalition. In the 1906 election the Party of Rights became the main opposition to the Coalition, and quite a staunch one at that, collaborating with ban Pavao Rauch (1908-1910), who represented the interests of Austria and Hungary, to depose the Coalition because of its \\"Yugoslav\\" programme. During the Bosnian annexation crisis in 1908, he was the initiator of a persecution of Serbs accused for high treason. Frank also played a role in the infamous Friedjung trial of 1909 where it would be proved that the Austrian historian Heinrich Friedjung reproduced libellous claims of treason against the leaders of the Croato-Serbian Coalition. Politically, Frank appeared as a radical nationalist, who apparently lent himself to the political ideas of a \\"Greater Croatia\\" and a trialistic approach to the Habsburg lands by making the Kingdom of Croatia the third entity in the empire. Unlike Ante Starƒçeviƒá, that was anticlerical, Frank considered to be useful collaboration with Catholic church in Croatia. In the later stages of his career, he appeared as a man of confidence to the Viennese authorities, often acting secretly on their behalf. Josip Frank's support for the Austrian court in his fight against the pro- Yugoslav and pro-Serbian forces did not go unopposed within his own party, as in 1908 Mile Starƒçeviƒá led a faction (called Milinovci) to form a splinter Starƒçeviƒá Party of Rights. In 1909 Frank fell terminally ill, and could no longer take active part in politics. After that, the party attracted a prominent group of Catholic intellectuals to join them in 1910 and changed their name to Christian-Social Party of Rights. In 1911, they reconciled with the Starƒçeviƒá Party of Rights, and merged back into a single Party of Rights. Frank lived to witness this, but died shortly thereafter. Frank was buried at the Mirogoj Cemetery. Gradska groblja Zagreb: Josip Frank, Mirogoj RKT-78-I-1 His daughter Olga was Slavko Kvaternik's wife.

On the show, Kid 'n Play were portrayed as teenagers, but their recording careers remained the same as in real life, as did their character traits. Production was by Marvel Productions and Saban Entertainment. The real Kid 'n Play appeared in live-action wraparounds of the cartoons, but voice actors took over for the animated versions of the duo. The show stressed positive role models, teaching children how to get along with each other and stay out of trouble. Akin to the House Party films, Play was the less responsible member of the duo, cooking up get rich quick schemes, while Kid, the more responsible member, would usually be made to clean up messes. Oftentimes the issue would be resolved by the characters' girlfriends, or sometimes by an elderly jazz musician who wore a blue beret and was aptly named \\"Old Blue\\". The lessons ranged from serious to lighter fare. One of the \\"less serious\\" episodes dealt with Kid's father under the impression hip hop is bad and Kid not having the means to put it in a positive light. Old Blue offers to help by sending Kid on a trip back in time to the era of jazz and 1920s speakeasies to help better understand its roots. Marvel Comics published a tie-in comic book which ran for nine issues in 1992. The series was created by John Semper Jr. and Cynthia Friedlob who also served as the show-runners and head-writers. They would later go on to write Kid 'N Play's third live- action feature, Class Act, for Warner Bros.

Even though lawyers have an expressive presence in the political scenery of Brazil, not one president after Faoro gained the same intellectual respect as he did. Faoro was author of a few books. The most important of all his books was \\"Os Donos do Poder\\" (The Owners of Power). In this book, Faoro describes the history of power in Brazilian history, since the pre-colonial times until approximately the end of the Get√∫lio Vargas first period. In this book, Faoro gave special attention to the \\"estamento\\", or Stand, which he notes was a classification used by Marx but mistranslated in the English and French translations of his German work.Chapter 2 \\"A Revolu√ß√£o Portuguesa\\" Note 16 IN Pg 68 of Os Donos Do Poder 6th Edition 1984 This \\"Stand\\", which he differentiates clearly from the ruling \\"Elite\\" was dominant in the creation of modern Brazil. According to Faoro, this \\"Stand\\", a strange mixture of the nobility, the bureaucrats and the military, always attempted to use the power and wealth of the State in self benefit, so preventing the masses from ruling the country in benefit of the majority. He also wrote books on Brazilian social and political thought, on the writer and poet Machado de Assis and Brazilian modern society and politics. Faoro's book became one of the references to understand the formation of Brazilian society and influenced Brazilian and Brazilianist sociology, historiography and political science. Other books which gained such recognition were Sergio Buarque de Holanda's Raizes do Brasil, Gilberto Freyre's Casa Grande e Senzala and Caio Prado Junior's Forma√ß√£o do Brasil Contempor√¢neo.

He was Member of Parliament for East Dorset from 1929 to 1931. Early life Glassey was born at Normanton, Yorkshire, the son of the Reverend William Glassey, a Congregational Minister.The Times, 25.10.24 He was educated at Penistone Grammar School. In 1910 he married Mary Longbottom. They had three daughters, Margaret, Gwen and Marianne. He served in the British Army throughout the First World War as a subaltern in the Highland Light Infantry and was mentioned in despatches.Who was Who, OUP 2007 Liberal Member of Parliament Glassey contested East Dorset at the 1924 general election coming second behind the Conservative.The Times, 25.9.29 The Liberals were not well organised nationally in 1924 and no longer had the uniting issue of Free Trade to provide an anti-Conservative focus as they had in 1923. One historian comments that ‚Äò...except for individuals like Lloyd George [the Liberals] fail[ed] to provide an inspiring programme for office...‚Äô However he also identifies Glassey as a local exception to this poor showing, who against the regional and national trends raised the party's share of the vote in a three-cornered contest. In contrast to many Liberal candidates, Glassey fought a vigorous and positive campaign. His election addresses concentrated on social issues and drew on Lloyd George's plans to develop the coal and power industries.Garry Tregidga, The Liberal Party in South-West Britain Since 1918, University of Exeter Press, 200 p37 This foreshadowed the policy issues the Liberal Party would put forward in the 1929 general election when Glassey fought the seat again, this time beating the sitting Tory MP, G. R. Hall Caine, albeit by the narrow majority of 277.The Times, 26.10.31 One of the political issues which Glassey supported was the unification of the three service ministries, the War Office, the Admiralty and the Air Ministry into a single Ministry of Defence, although this did not come about until as late as 1964. Glassey saw unification as a positive step on the road to disarmament and to promnote economy.Paul Smith, Government and the Armed Forces in Britain, 1856-1990, Continuum International Publishing, 1996 p.130 In 1931 Glassey became a minister in the National Government, a Lord Commissioner of the Treasury in effect a government whip. Liberal National In the Liberal split of September 1931, when Sir John Simon formed the Liberal National group in Parliament to continue giving support to the National Government, Glassey decided at a late stage to come down on the Liberal National side, a fact that was surprising in the light of his earlier loyalty to the leadership of Sir Herbert Samuel ‚Äì indeed one historian describes Glassey as a Samuelite even at the time of the general election and in the face of his description of himself as ‚ÄúTHE National Government candidate‚Äù.R Douglas, The History of the Liberal Party, 1895-1970, Sidgwick & Jackson, 1971 p.222 In fact Glassey proposed to stand as a candidate without reference to any party in 1931 and he received a message of support from Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald before the election.The Times, 24.10.31 Glassey said he stood as a National Government candidate endorsing every word in the Prime Minister's manifesto. The likely explanation for his choosing in the end actually to join the Liberal Nationals is that he realised his majority was vulnerable to the Conservative revival and was hoping the Unionists would stand aside for him as a supporter of the National Government. His wife spoke at election meetings on behalf of Samuelite candidates in other West Country constituencies and once the election was over, Glassey himself returned to the Liberals, becoming Chairman of the Western Counties Federation.Tregidga, op cit p.64 In fact the decision of the Conservatives to oppose Glassey caused some dissension in local Tory ranks as the Conservative Party at national level had agreed to support National Government candidates but not enough to prevent the former MP Hall Caine standing against him. Against the trend for National successes in 1931 across the country and the West Country, Glassey lost his seat back to Hall Caine.The Times, 29.10.31 Outside Parliament Outside Parliament Glassey was an important figure in the Congregational Church. He was Chairman of the Congregational Union of England and Wales from 1941‚Äì42, Co-Treasurer from 1953‚Äì57 and a Member of the Church Council). He was a member of the Commonwealth Missionary Society from 1945‚Äì47. From 1961‚Äì62 he was Director of Congregational Insurance Co.

Headquarters, machine gun, supply companies, and companies A,B,C,D,E, and F were organized at Camp Empire. Companies G,H,I,J,K,L, and M were organized at Camp Otis. The band section was organized at Fort Jay, N.Y. During the first four years of existence, the 33d. infantry was distributed by battalions, and detachments, throughout the canal zone and the Republic of Panama. During the World War, it guarded Gatun Locks, the dam and spillway, the Monte Lirio and Mindi Bridges, the Chagres River Bridge at Gamboa, the Pedro Miguel and Miraflores locks, pier 18 and the dry dock at Balboa. During the period from 1916 to 1920, the regiment was engaged in exploring and charting the jungles of Panama. In November, 1920, the young regiment assembled as a unit for the first time at Fort Clayton Canal Zone. The new post was named in honor of Colonel Bertram Tracy Clayton, who was killed in action in France May 30, 1918. In 1941 the regiment was transferred from the Panama Canal Department to the Caribbean Defense Command. On 6 September 1941, the 1st Battalion was sent to Trinidad, with elements of the 1st Battalion later transferring to Surinam to guard bauxite mines, protect the Dutch government in exile, and watch the border of Vichy French Guiana. The 2d and 3d Battalions later arrived at Fort Read in Trinidad. The 1st Battalion was withdrawn from Surinam in June 1943 and moved to Aruba. In March 1944 the regiment departed Trinidad arriving in New York in 1944, the first time the regimental colors arrived on Continental American soil. The regiment was assigned to Camp Claiborne Louisiana and assigned to the Fourth United States Army. Many of the regiment volunteered for Merrill's Marauders and were sent to Burma as the 2d Battalion 5307th Composite Unit (Provisional). The regiment was inactivated on 26 June 1944. The 33d Infantry was reactivated at Fort Clayton on February 1946, inactivated again on September 1948 at Fort Gulick, then reactivated at Fort Kobbe, Canal Zone. During the Korean War the 3d Battalion of the 33d was transferred to the 65th Infantry Regiment for war service. The 33d Infantry became part of the Americal Division in the Canal Zone on 2 December 1954, with the regiment being inactivated again on 26 May 1956, the assets of the unit being used to reactivate the 20th Infantry Regiment. Lineage Constituted 1 July 1916 in the Regular Army as the 33rd Infantry. Organized 5‚Äì7 July 1916 in the Canal Zone by the transfer of personnel from the 5th and 10th Infantry Regiments at Empire, and Camp Otis, Canal Zone. Inactivated 26 June 1944 at Camp Claiborne, Louisiana. :Activated 1 February 1946 at Fort Clayton, Canal Zone. Inactivated 1 September 1948 at Fort Clayton. Activated 4 January 1950 at Fort Kobbe, Canal Zone. Inactivated 26 May 1956 at Fort Kobbe.

The analytical profile index or API is a classification of bacteria based on biochemical tests, allowing fast identification. This system is developed for quick identification of clinically relevant bacteria. Because of this, only known bacteria can be identified. It was invented in the 1970s in the United States by Pierre Janin of Analytab Products, Inc.http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph- Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2;=HITOFF&d;=PALL&p;=1&u;=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r;=1&f;=G&l;=50&s1;=3936356.PN.&OS;=PN/3936356&RS;=PN/3936356 Presently, the API test system is manufactured by bioM√©rieux. The API range introduced a standardized, miniaturized version of existing techniques, which up until then were complicated to perform and difficult to read. One of the API systems is specific for differentiating between members of the Gram negative bacterial Family Enterobacteriaceae and is called API-20E. The other API system is specific for Gram positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus species, Micrococcus, species, and related organisms, and is called API-Staph. API test strips consists of wells containing dehydrated substrates to detect enzymatic activity, usually related to fermentation of carbohydrate or catabolism of proteins or amino acids by the inoculated organisms. A bacterial suspension is used to rehydrate each of the wells and the strips are incubated. During incubation, metabolism produces color changes that are either spontaneous or revealed by the addition of reagents. For example, when carbohydrates are fermented, the pH within the well decreases and that change is indicated by a change in the color of the pH indicator. All positive and negative test results are compiled to obtain a profile number, which is then compared with profile numbers in a commercial codebook (or online) to determine the identification of the bacterial species. API 20E/NE The API 20E/NE fast identification system combines some conventional tests and allows the identification of a limited number of Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae or non-Enterobacteriaceae. The test systems are stored in 20 small reaction tubes, which include the substrates. An identification is only possible with microbiological culture. Before starting a test, one must confirm the culture is of an Enterobacteriaceae. To test this, a quick oxidase test for cytochrome c oxidase is performed. Enterobacteriaceae are typically oxidase negative, meaning they either do not use oxygen as an electron acceptor in the electron transport chain, or they use a different cytochrome enzyme for transferring electrons to oxygen. If the culture is determined to be oxidase positive, alternative tests must be carried out to correctly identify the bacterial species.

The idea for the Industrielleneingabe had emerged at the end of October 1932 in the Freundeskreis der Wirtschaft (\\"Keppler circle\\"; Keppler-Kreis) and was supported by Heinrich Himmler, who worked as a liaison to the Brown House. The drafting of the letter was aided especially by Hjalmar Schacht, who was the only member of the Keppler-Kreis with any significant political experience. The Industrielleneingabe was first published in 1956 in the Zeitschrift f√ºr Geschichtswissenschaft and is used as evidence to support the idea that big business played a central role in the rise of the Nazi Party.

Hofstede (September 25, 1940 - September 3, 2016) was an American politician who served two non-consecutive terms as mayor of Minneapolis, Minnesota, both times representing the Minnesota Democratic- Farmer-Labor Party. Political career Over the course of his career, Hofstede served Minnesota governor Karl Rolvaag, was a member of the Minneapolis City Council for four years, a chairperson of the Metropolitan Council from 1971 to 1973, and mayor of Minneapolis for two terms. His position as Metropolitan Council chairperson was granted by governor Wendell Anderson. Hofstede was Minneapolis's first Roman Catholic mayor as well as its youngest at the time of his first election; his first term, as the city's 41st mayor, began on January 1, 1974, when he was 34 years old. The term ended on December 31, 1975, after he was defeated for reelection by independent Charles Stenvig, who had already been mayor from 1970 to 1973. In 1977 Hofstede defeated Stenvig to win another term (the 43rd), which ended on December 31, 1979. During the years that Milwaukee Avenue, a two-block area of half-lot, almost identical houses, was threatened, Hofstede led the way to protect it. He led a tour of the area for residents, neighbors, activists and others. The area was eventually designated an historic district. Later, Hofstede worked as an advisor at North State Advisors. Personal life Hofstede was born in Minneapolis on September 25, 1940. He met and married his wife, Emma Hofstede (n√©e Hild) who was a schoolteacher and a nun.

Situated in the Tequila Valleys of Jalisco, the Teuchitl√°n culture shared in the tradition of burying some of their dead in shaft and chamber tombs. Archaeological work from the past few decades have demonstrated that West Mexico was not occupied by one homogeneous culture, historically referred to as the shaft tomb tradition, that stretched from Nayarit, Jalisco, and Colima. Instead, West Mexico was composed of multiple cultures with several distinct commonalities. The Teuchitl√°n culture is an archaeologically defined culture named after the town of Teuchitl√°n where the largest Teuchitl√°n culture site, Los Guachimontones, is located.Phil C. Weigand (1989).

Electronic document, http://www.famsi.org/reports/03009/03009Mountjoy01.pdf suggest a long continuity of shaft and chamber use in West Mexico. Phil Weigand documented several Middle Formative mounds in the Tequila Valleys in the 1970s and 1980s. These large, low mounds supposedly contained burials that looters had robbed in the past. However, Weigand never published more than some plan maps and descriptions of these mounds. During the Late Formative period, the Tequila Valleys experienced a surge in population density resulting in the proliferation of surface and subsurface architecture. The sub-surface architecture, in the form of shaft and chamber tombs, is more familiar to archaeologists and the public. This is a result of the rampant looting of tombs starting in the 19th century and continuing until the 1970s, though some looting continues to a lesser extent. Looters focused on shaft and chamber tombs to retrieve the hollow and solid ceramic figures sometimes placed within as mortuary offerings to the deceased. These ceramic figures were sold on the art market to collectors and museums in Mexico and abroad. Painters Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo were frequent collectors of ceramic figures from West Mexico, often incorporating them into their works such as Diego Rivera‚Äôs ‚ÄúLa Civilizaci√≥n Tarasca‚Äù (1950). Other notable collectors include Vincent Price whose collection Kahl√∫a used for advertisements in the 1960s.Judy Sund (2000). Beyond the grave: The twentieth-century afterlife of west Mexican burial effigies. The Art Bulletin 82(4): 734-767. The Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Gilcrease Museum also have extensive West Mexican collections. One of the defining features of the Teuchitl√°n culture is the construction and use of circular temples called guachimontones. These buildings consist of several architectural features: a basal circular platform that acts as a patio, a ring platform called a banquette constructed on top of the patio platform, an even number of quadrangular platforms constructed on top of the banquette, and a stepped altar located in the center of the patio.Phil C. Weigand (1996). The Architecture of the Teuchitl√°n Tradition of the Occidente of Mesoamerica. Ancient Mesoamerica 7(1): 91-101. Guachimontones are most heavily concentrated in the Tequila Valleys, but examples are found outside of the cultural boundaries of the Teuchitl√°n culture.

Cultura arqueol√≥gica de Bola√±os (Zacatecas y Jalisco): Una frontera cultura. Ancient Mesoamerica 2(2): 193-203. Weigand had proposed that the construction of guachimontones followed on the construction of shaft and chamber tombs. The shift from sub-surface to surface architecture was a shift in how power transferred from the association with the dead to power held by the living. However, this hypothesis no longer holds up to scrutiny.Christopher S. Beekman (2016). Settlement Patterns and Excavations: Contexts of Tombs and Figures in Central Jalisco. In Shaft Tombs and Figures in West Mexican Society: A Reassessment edited by Christopher S. Beekman and Robert B. Pickering, pp. 85-96. Gilcrease Museum, Tulsa, Oklahoma. Excavations at the site of Los Guachimontones place the construction date of the largest guachimonton in the Tequila Valleys, Circle 1, between 160 to 60 BCE.Christopher S. Beekman (2018).

Archaeology of the Municipio of Etzatl√°n, Jalisco. Unpublished Ph. D. dissertation, University of California, Los Angeles and the elaborate tomb at Huitzilapa. Recently, Beekman proposed a different explanation for the relationship between guachimontones and shaft and chamber tombs. Beekman argues that around Los Guachimontones, cultural rules and norms were most heavily enforced among the population with power being shared relatively equally between ruling elite lineages. As one moves away from Los Guachimontones, ruling elites that managed a smaller population and site, were able to exert a greater degree of control. This allowed elites to invest more heavily in the construction of tombs that promoted their lineage than in public architecture used by other elites and the community. Characteristics  Shaft and Chamber Tombs  Recreation of a shaft and chamber tomb from the Casa de Cultura in Tala, Jalisco, Mexico Shaft and chamber tombs were typically used for related family members, possibly part of a lineage.Christopher S. Beekman (2008) Corporate Power Strategies in the Late Formative to Early Classic Tequila Valleys of Central Jalisco. Latin American Antiquity 19(4): 414-434.Christopher S. Beekman and Luis Javier Galv√°n Villegas (2006). The shaft tombs of the Atemajac Valley and their relation to settlement. Ancient Mesoamerica 17(2): 259-270. Archaeologists consider shaft and chamber tombs to be an expression of broader Mesoamerican beliefs. Chambers may represent artificial caves which are associated with the Underworld being a dark, watery space located underground.Christopher S. Beekman (2003). Fruitful Symmetry: Corn and Cosmology in the Public Architecture of Late Formative and Early Classic Jalisco. Mesoamerican Voices (1): 5-22.Kristi Butterwick (1998). Days of the Dead: Ritual Consumption and Ancestor Worship in an Ancient West Mexican Society. Ph.D. dissertation, Department of Anthropology, University of Colorado, Boulder. The accompaniment of conch shells with the deceased may reinforce that association. Archaeologists in the Tequila Valleys have documented some of the deepest and most richly furnished shaft and chamber tombs in West Mexico. The site of El Arenal boasts a shaft and chamber tomb with a shaft depth of 16 meters.Jos√© Corona N√∫√±ez (1955). Tumba de El Arenal, Etzatl√°n, Jalisco. Direcci√≥n de Monumentos Prehisp√°nicos. Instituto Nacional de Antropolog√≠a e Historia, M√©xico. Archaeologists excavating at the site of Huitzilapa discovered a shaft and chamber tomb consisting of two chambers, six individuals, and hundreds of artifacts. Mortuary goods consisted of complete and broken ceramic figures, vessels, ground stone, jadeite, quartz, shell jewelry, conch shells, and the oldest amate paper in Mesoamerica (dated to 73 CE).Bruce F. Benz and Jorge Ramos De La Vega (2006). Organic offerings, paper, and fibers from the Huitzilapa shaft tomb, Jalisco, Mexico. Ancient Mesoamerica 17(2): 283-296. While archaeologists in both Nayarit and Colima have documented more shaft and chamber tombs than in Jalisco, none are as elaborate, deep, or large as those found in the Tequila Valleys.  Guachimontones  Guachimontones are the circular ceremonial buildings constructed by the Teuchitl√°n culture people within the Tequila Valleys. A typical guachimonton (colloquially called a circle in both English and Spanish) consists of four basic architectural features: the patio, the banquette, the altar, and the platforms. The patio consists of a circular platform that forms the base of the building and dictates its maximum diameter. Constructed on top of the patio are both the banquette and the altar. The banquette consists of a ring-shaped platform whose outer diameter conforms to the diameter of the patio platform. The inner diameter of the banquette is set somewhere in the patio space dictating the size of the platforms and constraining the available patio space. Constructed in the center of the patio is the altar that exhibits a range of diameters, sizes, and shapes and constrains the available patio space. Typically, constructed on top of the banquette is an even number of quadrangular platforms ranging in number from four to sixteen. Color-coded schematic of a guachimonton indicating its various architectural features Scholars have proposed several ideological or cosmological interpretations for the guachimontones. J. Charles Kelley.J. Charles Kelley (1974). Speculations on the culture history of northwestern Mesoamerica. In The Archaeology of West Mexico, edited by Betty Bell, pp. 19-39. Sociedad de Estudios Avanzados del Occidente de Mexico. was the first to suggest that the ceramic models looted from shaft and chamber tombs depicting one to four house structures and a pole in the center space with a person perched on top may be a depiction of a version of the volador ceremony practiced in Mexico today. Some of these models depict two poles, one straight, and one curved, perhaps as a way to indicate motion. Christopher Beekman expanded upon this idea several decades later to support the volador idea and to suggest practices could include other pole ceremonies known elsewhere from Mesoamerica. Kelley also suggested that the altar of a guachimonton might represent an artificial mountain, a cosmologically significant feature to Mesoamerican beliefs. Mountains were where the gods dwelt, where water flowed from, and where one could find caves to the underworld. Shaft and chamber tombs may represent artificial caves with their location underground. Together, tombs, guachimontones, and a pole ceremony, depicts the Mesoamerican cosmology of an underworld, an earthly plane, and the heavens. Christopher WitmoreChristopher L. Witmore (1998). Sacred Sun Centers. In Ancient West Mexico: Art of the Unknown Past, edited by Richard F. Townsend, pp. 137-149. Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago. interprets the form of the guachimonton, with the altar in the center and platforms arranged around the patio space, to represent the sun. Witmore draws upon Wix√°ritari (Huichol) ethnographic work to suggest that the guachimonton may be an ancient version of the contemporary Wix√°ritari tuki. He compares the structures to ideological concepts of the Wix√°ritari deities Grandfather Fire and Father Sun. Alternatively, Christopher BeekmanChristopher S. Beekman (2003). Agricultural Pole Rituals and Rulership in Late Formative Central Jalisco. Ancient Mesoamerica (14): 299-318. suggests that a typical eight platform guachimonton might represent eight-row maize, a variety of maize with its origins in West Mexico. If one cuts a maize cob in half, the eight kernels and cob core looks similar to that of a guachimonton. This association with maize may be linked to volador ceremonies or other Mesoamerican pole-related ceremonies, such as pole-climbing and green maize ceremonies. In her dissertation, Butterwick sees guachimontones as places of ancestor worship and of feasting. Drawing upon excavation data from the site of Huitzilapa and looted ceramic models from tombs that depict simplified guachimontones, Butterwick argues that guachimontones may simply be four platform groups with a central ancestral shrine made larger. The ceramic models without a pole in their center often depict the spaces as a hub of activities from marriage ceremonies, to food preparation, to music making and dancing, and even warfare. The ceramics found at Huitzilapa outside of the tomb tend to be serving ware and their distribution suggests feasting was an important activity. A similar model is viable for Los Guachimontones despite its larger size and lack of documented elaborate shaft tombs.Catherine Janette Johns (2014). Ceramic Activity Analysis of Navajas Circle 5 and the need for Practice Theory in Unusual Monumental Architecture. Thesis, Department of Anthropology, University of Colorado Denver. Culture  Politics  Three different political systems have been proposed for the Teuchitl√°n culture with the site of Los Guachimontones having a role in all three systems. Phil Weigand and Christopher Beekman proposed the first in 1998 that consisted of a segmentary state model. In this model, there is a concentrated core and a broad surrounding hinterland. Within the core of the segmentary state, control is exerted through ceremonialism rather than political force. The Tequila Valleys constitute the core of this segmentary state based on the number of sites with guachimontones and the size of the guachimontones. Guachimontones located outside of the Tequila Valleys are then considered peripheral regions that exploited rare resources for the core. Within the segmentary state, Weigand argued a settlement hierarchy existed between the major sites in the region. Los Guachimontones was at the top of this proposed hierarchy. Smaller, but still large sites, like Ahualulco, Navajas, and Santa Quiteria, would have provided further administrative control over the region. Smaller sites were hypothesized act as loci for minor elite control or as a way to promote population cohesion. Lorenza Lopez Mestas in 2011 proposed that the Teuchitl√°n culture consisted of a collection of lineage or clan-based chiefdoms. In this model, each ceremonial center in the Tequila Valleys was the site of a chiefdom.Lorenza Lopez Mestas Camberos (2011). Ritualidad, prestigio y poder en el centro de Jalisco durante el precl√°sico tard√≠o y cl√°sico temprano. Un acercamiento a la cosmovisi√≥n e ideolog√≠a en el occidente del M√©xico prehisp√°nico. Unpublished PhD. dissertation, Department of Anthropology, Centro de Investigaciones y Estudios Superiores en Antropolog√≠a Social, Guadalajara, M√©xico. These chiefdoms would have banded together in defense of the valleys but would have also engaged in conflict and trade with each other. Lopez Mestas argued the primary mechanism of power that chiefs relied upon was their ability to engage in trade for exotic or prestigious goods, like jadeite and shell, from outside of the Tequila Valleys. Chiefly power was not absolute, however, and was based upon consensus rather than coercion. Failing to perform their necessary duties could result in a loss of power. One mechanism to maintain power would have been feasting. Lopez Mestas suggests that elites would try to convince commoners to donate artisan goods or domestic surplus to increase chiefly wealth and status. With this newfound wealth and status, chiefs could then hold larger feasts and gain control over even more resources. Beekman later proposed a new political structure for the Teuchitl√°n culture. In 2008 he suggested a model in which Teuchitl√°n culture centers were ruled by corporate groups composed of multiple lineages, clans, or elite families. These corporate groups would have coopered together to form a broader collective governance. Beekman‚Äôs model is based on his excavations at two smaller sites, Llano Grande and Navajas, and his examination of the architecture. Irregularities within the construction of these structures suggest that separate labor groups were employed for construction, specifically the platforms of the guachimonton. These differences likely indicate a form of competition and status signaling.  Food  Food remains recovered archaeologically are somewhat sparse in the Tequila Valleys because of limited excavations focused on other contexts. However, evidence for some food can be gleaned from limited ethnohistoric, art historic, and archaeological data. In the Autl√°n-Tuxcacuesco area to the south of Tequila Valley, Kelly remarked how indigenous peoples in the region in 1525 relied heavily on the maguey plant. The leaves were chopped off and roasted for food, the fibers in the plant were gathered to spin into thread, and for brewing.Isabel Truesdell Kelly (1949). The Archaeology of the Autl√°n- Tuxcacuesco Area of Jalisco: The Tuxcacuesco-Zapotitl√°n Zone/by Isabel Kelly. University of California Press. Maize and chili were important crops as well as guam√∫chil, plum, copal jocote, guaje, array√°n, sapote, and guava.Isabel Truesdell Kelly (1945). The archaeology of the Autl√°n-Tuxcacuesco area of Jalisco. Vol. 1. University of California Press. Butterwick took a more art historical approach to food in her discussion of ritual feasting at the site of Huitzilapa. Turning a critical eye to the ceramic models from West Mexico, Butterwick notes that food is depicted as either cylindrical, globular, discoid, or lump. She suggests that these shapes correspond to tamales or ears of maize, fruits, cakes, or beans, respectively. Zizumbo-Villareal et al. (2014) approach food in West Mexico through a hybridized ethnographic, art historic, and archaeological approach. They conducted open-ended interviews with people around the Zapotitlan region of Jalisco. These interviews inquired to the dishes and beverages they recalled from the time of their great grandfathers. They cross checked the results of these interviews with archaeological and art historical data. The result are 29 native species to the region, 4 native species likely introduced from other parts of Mesoamerica, and up to 75 wild native plants that were likely part of the Late-Formative to Classic period diet.Daniel Zizumbo-Villarreal, Alondra Flores-Silva, and Patricia Colunga-Garc√≠aMar√≠n (2014). The food system during the formative period in west Mesoamerica. Economic botany 68(1): 67-84. These foods include varieties of maize, agave, squash, beans, and chili.  Art  The most recognizable form of artwork by the Teuchitl√°n culture are its hollow and solid ceramic figures.Kristi Butterwick (2004). Heritage of power: ancient sculpture from West Mexico: the Andrall E. Pearson family collection. Metropolitan Museum of Art.Jacki Gallagher (1983).

Like many other West Mexican cultures during the Late Formative to Classic period, the Teuchitl√°n culture created ceramic figures depicting a variety of people in different styles, wearing differing clothing and accoutrements, and in a variety of poses and actions. The hollow figurine styles most commonly found in the Tequila Valleys are the Ameca-Etzatlan, San Juanto, and Tala styles.Hasso Von Winning (1974). The shaft tomb figures of West Mexico. No. 24. Southwest Museum. Hollow figurines often depict warriors, ball players, high status individuals, and people holding vessels. Ceramic vessels come in a variety of styles with the most notable being Oconahua Red-on-White vessels with its characteristic red geometric pattern on a white background. While patterns tend to be geometric in design, there are some rare examples of animal depictions. The most common motif is that of the serpent, which may be related to broader Mesoamerican cosmology.Verenice Y. Heredia Espinoza and Joshua D. Englehardt (2015). Simbolismo panmesoamericano en la iconograf√≠a cer√°mica de la tradici√≥n Teuchitl√°n.\\" Trace (M√©xico, DF) 68: 9-34.  Ballgame  A panorama of Ball Court 2 from the site of Los Guachimontones The history for the Mesoamerican ball game in West Mexico dates back to the Early Formative period (1500 ‚Äì 900 BCE) with the site of El Ope√±o. El Ope√±o is located just southeast of Lake Chapala over the Jalisco/Michoac√°n border. The site consists of a shaft tomb cemetery, though short staircases lead to the tombs rather than vertical shafts. Within several of these tombs, ceramic figurines were discovered interred with the dead. A group of 16 figurines were found together in one tomb. Eight of the figurines appear to depict people playing the ball game. Five figures are nude men with various pieces of ball game equipment and three are nude women.Jane Stevenson Day (1998). The West Mexican Ballgame. Ancient West Mexico: Art and Archaeology of the Unknown Past, edited by Richard F. Townsend, pp. 151-167. Art Institute of Chicago. The Late Formative to Classic period continued to depict ball players in some of their ceramic figures. These figures are often seen holding a ball. Solid ceramic dioramas or models from the greater West Mexico region depict multiple people playing the ball game and often accompanied by spectators sitting or standing on the ball court walls.Eric Taladoire (1979). Ball-Game Scenes and Ball-Courts in West Mexican Archaeology. A Problem in Chronology. INDIANA 5: 33-44.Eric Taladoire (1998). Los juegos de pelota en el occidente de M√©xico. El occidente de M√©xico: arqueologƒ±a, historia y medio ambiente. Perspectivas regionales. Actas del IV Coloquio Internacional de Occidentalistas, pp. 175-187. Universidad de Guadalajara, Guadalajara Some figurines depict warrior/ball players with a mix of clothing and equipment, a common association elsewhere in Mesoamerica. Some of these figures show people wearing protective leather pants. Some of the skeletal remains from Huitzilapa have lesions on their arms and hips, consistent with atlatl use and hitting balls or falling upon their hips for the ball game. Ball courts in the Tequila Valley are typically of the I-shape variety. Two long, narrow, parallel platforms form the playing place while two end platforms designate the end of the playing space. Unlike other Mesoamerican ball courts, Teuchitl√°n culture ball courts do not have sloping sides. Instead, the two parallel platforms have straight vertical sides. These platforms are not very tall; Ball Court 2 at Los Guachimontones is only 1.1 meters tall. Ball courts are typically attached to a guachimonton with a platform from a guachimonton forming the end platform for the ball court. However, free standing ball courts do exist such as Ball Court 2 at Los Guachimontones. Notable Sites  Los Guachimontones  Los Guachimontones is the largest Teuchitl√°n culture site in the Tequila Valleys. The archaeological site is located in the hills just north of the town of Teuchitl√°n. The largest guachimontones in the Tequila Valleys are located here with the site commanding a central position within the region.Michael A. Ohnersorgen and Mark D. Varien (1996). Formal architecture and settlement in ancient West Mexico. Ancient Mesoamerica 7(1): 103-120. Currently, the earliest documentation of the site dates to the late 19th century when Adela Breton visited and photographed the site.Mary Frech McVicker (2005). Adela Breton: A Victorian artist amid Mexico's ruins. UNM Press, Albuquerque. The site remained relatively unknown to archaeologists until the 1970s when Weigand (1974)Phil C. Weigand (1974). The Ahualulco Site and the Shaft-Tomb Complex of the Etzatl√°n Area. In The Archaeology of West Mexico edited by Betty Bell, pp. 120-131.

Proceedings of the 1974 International Congress of Americanists, Mexico. published the first reports on the structures. Excavation and restoration began in 1999 and continued to 2010. According to the Instituto Nacional de Antropolog√≠a e Historia visitor statistics, Los Guachimontones is Jalisco‚Äôs most visited site and Mexico‚Äôs 13th most visited in 2019.  Tabachines  The site of Tabachines is located in the nearby Atamejac Valley, which present-day Guadalajara now dominates. Tabachines was discovered in the 1970s as the city of Guadalajara sought to expand a highway. The site consists of an unlooted cemetery of shaft and chamber tombs dating to the Late Formative to Classic periods and an unlooted box tomb cemetery dating to the later Epiclassic.Luis Javier Galv√°n Villegas (1976). Rescate arqueol√≥gico en el fraccionamiento Tabachines, Zapopan, Jalisco. Cuadernos de los Centros Regionales, 28. Instituto Nacional de Antropolog√≠a e Historia, M√©xico.Luis Javier Galv√°n Villegas (1991). Las tumbas de tiro de Valley de Atemajac, Jalisco. Serie Arqueolog√≠a. Instituto Nacional de Antropolog√≠a e Historia, M√©xico City. There was no surface architecture in the area of both cemeteries. It is possible that this particular location held some sort of significance from one period to the next despite dramatic social and political changes experienced within the region. Tabachines is of importance to understanding the Teuchitl√°n culture because it offered a plethora of data on shaft and chamber tombs. While these tombs are not as elaborate as the ones documented by archaeologists or raided by looters in the Tequila Valleys, many of the same types of mortuary goods were found in situ within these tombs. This allowed for the creation of a ceramic typology to help provide relative dates for other archaeology sites.Christopher S. Beekman and Phil C. Weigand (2000). La cer√°mica arqueol√≥gica de la tradici√≥n Teuchitl√°n, Jalisco: tipolog√≠a, an√°lisis petrogr√°fico y cronolog√≠a. El Colegio de Michoac√°n AC.  El Arenal  El Arenal was partially explored by Corona N√∫√±ez in the 1950s and then later revisted by Long in the 1960s. Corona N√∫√±ez excavated the partially looted monumental tomb. The monumental shaft for the tomb measures 16 meters deep. At the base of the shaft, two passages lead to different chambers. One chamber has a passage leading to a third chamber. Most of the contents were looted, but Corona N√∫√±ez did recover poorly preserved skeletal fragments within the tomb. Some of the tomb contents in the form of ceramic figures were in the nearby town of Santa Rosalia. Photographs of these pictures provide a partial idea of what was once in the tombs. In the 1960s Long discovered several unlooted tombs at the site. While these tombs were not as large as the monumental tomb, and many had filled in with mud and dirt, they nonetheless provided important data regarding the mortuary goods found within tombs in this region. A recreation of the El Arenal tomb can be found at the Casa de la Cultura de Etzatlan in Etzatlan, Jalisco. Tomb contents include hollow ceramic figures, jade beads, ceramic vessels, skeletal fragments, ground stone, and shell jewelry.  Huitzilapa  Huitzilapa is one of the most important Teuchitl√°n culture sites in the Tequila Valleys. Located just east of Magdalena, archaeologists excavated the first monumental elaborate shaft tomb in the region. While San Sebastian contained a large number of artifacts, Huitzilapa‚Äôs tomb contained tens of thousands of artifacts divided between its two chambers. Notable tomb contents include conch shells decorated in pseudo- cloisonn√©, jadeite atatl finger loops, hollow ceramic figures, greenstone figurines, and amate paper along with ceramic vessels, ground stone, and shell jewelry. The amate paper, found near the cranium of one of the individuals, was dated to 73 CE making it the oldest paper in Mesoamerica. Skeletal analysis of the six individuals found within the tombs revealed that five of them shared similar spinal defects.Robert B. Pickering and Maria Teresa Cabrero (1998). Mortuary practices in the shaft tomb region. In Ancient west Mexico: Art and archaeology of the unknown past, edited by Richard F. Townsend, pp. 71‚Äì87. Art Institute of Chicago. One individual, an older woman, did not share this defect. This suggests that five of the individuals were closely related, likely part of the same family. The older woman was perhaps the spouse of one of the other deceased. These individuals were likely elites at Huitzilapa based on the amount and quality of their mortuary goods and the placement of the tomb within the site. The tomb at Huitzilapa is a stark contrast against the simpler tombs at Tabachines or even the frequently re- used tombs at Bola√±os. The relatedness and status of the individuals suggests that power and authority may derive from elite lineages that have long histories at their site.  San Sebastian  While San Sebastian is by no means a monumental tomb, it is one of the few unlooted tombs excavated by archaeologists in the region. San Sebastian provided Long (1966) with important data regarding shaft tomb contents, ceramic types, and ceramic figure types. These data, along with radiocarbon dates, allowed Long to create an early chronology for the Tequila Valleys region. This chronology allowed some changes in ceramic vessels and figures to be tracked through time, though this may be limited to just the Magdalena Lake Basin region. The tomb contained the remains of nine individuals along with a number of ground stone artifacts, obsidian tools, bone and shell jewelry, shell trumpet, ceramic vessels, green stone, and ceramic figures. Of note is the placement of two ceramic figures near the entrance of the tomb. A male figure was found at the east side and a female figure at the west side of the entrance. This placement could relate to broader Mesoamerican cosmology in which deceased male warriors accompanied the sun as it rose in the east to its zenith while women who died in childbirth accompanied the sun from its zenith to where it set in the west.Jane H. Hill (1992). The flower world of old Uto-Aztecan. Journal of Anthropological Research 48(2): 117-144.

Established in 1553 as part of the Royal and Pontifical University of Mexico, it is one of the oldest medical schools in the Americas. The school has undergraduate and graduate studies departments. It does joint teaching with some other schools, e.g., the School of Science. It also has many grants involving UNAM's Engineering School, in areas such as smart and connected health. It is one of the most recognized schools in the university and in Mexico. The latest three rectors of the university, including the current one, are former deans from this school. History The origin of the School of Medicine of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico, known by the acronym UNAM) dates back to the 16th century, with the foundation of the Royal and Pontifical Mexico University (). In fact, the first decree that authorizes their creation was promulgated by Philip II in 1547 and endorsed in 1551. Nevertheless, the compliance of procedures and the liberation of the corresponding funds postponed the start of their activities until January 1553. By some years, in the area of the medicine, the University was limited to offer incorporation of degrees of other universities that needed it. The first degree of doctor in medicine was offered August 10, 1553 to Juan Blanco Alc√°zar. The first course of medicine given in The Royal and Pontifical Mexico University initiated its activities January 7, 1579. The program of studies was adjusted to the one used in the University of Salamanca, just like the remainder of the regulatory activities of The Royal and Pontifical Mexico University. Such program consisted of four years of studies. Subsequently, the students carried out a practice of two years next to a recognized doctor and only after finishing this requirement they would be able to opt for the degrees of licentiate, master and doctor. In the middle of the 16th century a theoretical-practical model was imposed that included the dissection in corpse. Following the closing of the university by Valent√≠n G√≥mez Far√≠as in 1883 the school survived in the form of several departments in charge of teaching medicine. Graduating in 1887 the first female doctor Matilde Montoya. It existed that way until 1902 when the university was reopened by Justo Sierra. The School open the door to graduate studies in 1960. Staff and organization The school is run by the dean, currently Germ√°n Fajardo Dolci. The school is divided into departments, each with a head who reports to the school dean. The secretary of medical education also has several departments which are responsible for one or more subjects. *Department of Anatomy: responsible for the anatomy courses. *Department of Embryology: responsible for the embryology and clinical genetics courses. *Department of Cell and Histological Biology: responsible for the Histology course. *Department of Biochemistry: responsible for the Biochemistry and Immunology courses. *Department of Public Health: responsible for the Public Health courses. *Department of Pharmacology: responsible for the Pharmacology courses. *Department of Physiology: responsible for the Physiology courses. *Department of Surgery: responsible for the Surgery courses. *Department of Microbiology and Parasitology: responsible for the Microbiology and Parasitology courses. *Department of Biomedical Informatics: responsible for the Biomedical Informatics courses. *Department of Amphitheater: responsible of the postgraduate surgery courses and investigation on corpses. Location & Facilities The School is located in Ciudad Universitaria in Mexico City, near the School of Chemistry and the School of Odontology. It consists of one main complex, divided into seven buildings, built when University City was opened. The School also has annexes at several hospitals in Mexico City's metropolitan area, most notably an annex at the General Hospital of Mexico, where the Department of Experimental Medicine is located. It has one main library and several others used mostly for postgraduate studies. Graduate Studies It holds the Graduate program in medicine (MD) called \\"Titulo de Medico Cirujano\\" (Physician-Surgeon Diploma). Importance In Mexico, the School of Medicine UNAM is generally regarded as one of the most important, if not the most important of the country; it has several links with hospitals and communities, and its students are usually in communities for their social service. The school also is in charge of the National Exam of Medical Residencies (ENARM), which means that if any MD in Mexico wants to apply for a residency, they should apply to this school, it is regarded to be very hard, and students some times take a full year of study in order to pass it. Approximately 22,000 students present the exam and only 4,000 pass it every year. The school has two Howard Hughes Medical Institute Scholars and endowment from the NIH extramural research program.

The House of Soviets was left in this state for over 20 years before completion. The House of Soviets is an unfinished building located in the city of Kaliningrad (K√∂nigsberg prior to 1946) in the Kaliningrad Oblast, an exclave of Russia. The local people often refer to it as the \\"buried robot\\" because its appearance resembles the head of a giant robot which is buried in the ground up to the shoulders. The chief architect was Lev Misoshnikov. It was built on the original site of K√∂nigsberg Castle.

Although is widely claimed that the House of Soviets was built directly on top of the K√∂nigsberg castle, the actual building stands to the east, on the castle's former moat.  History  K√∂nigsberg Castle was severely damaged during the bombing of K√∂nigsberg in World War II. The city came under the control of the USSR after the war and the Soviet authorities opted not to preserve the castle remains, claiming it was a centre of fascism. Whatever remained of the castle was blown up and cleared away between 1967 and 1969.

There were two architectural competitions for the redevelopment of the area, in 1964 and 1974, which included design firms from Moscow, Leningrad, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. The design chosen was by architect Lev Misoshnikov, who was a laureate of the USSR state prize and well respected within Soviet Russia, and his studio TsNIIEP. After 2005 paint job Construction started in 1970 on what was intended to be the central administration building of the Kaliningrad Oblast. The building is situated to the east of the former castle, near the former castle moat. Placing the heavy concrete structure on top of the ruins resulted in structural problems, not to mention that the castle itself was built on marshy soil. The foundations proved to be inadequate to support the original 28-story plan and only 21 stories were completed. Continuation of development was stopped in 1985 after the regional Party Committee lost interest in the project and ran out of funding. In 1992 there was an attempt to finish the construction with Danish funding but it was abandoned. The building was left unfinished for many years. In 2005, for Kaliningrad's 60th and K√∂nigsberg's 750th anniversary, also marked by visit by Russian President Vladimir Putin, the exterior was painted light blue and windows were installed. The new color diminished the sense of brooding mass, but some criticized this update as a modern Potemkin fa√ßade. The interior remained unfinished and unusable. A German consultant recommended tearing down the entire structure and building anew as cheaper and safer than attempting to repair and finish the existing shell. While some consider the building to be one on the worst examples of post-war Soviet architecture, the House of Soviets was seen by others as a good example of Brutalist architecture, particularly before its pastel paint job.

The Palestinian towns of Dura al-Qar' and Ein Yabrud lie to the north, Rammun to the east, Deir Dibwan to the southeast and al-Bireh to the southwest. The Israeli settlement of Beit El is northwest of Beitin. Geography There are several springs around Beitin, which is known for its olive, almond, fig and plum groves. History Periods of settlement The site was first settled during the Chalcolithic period. Sherds from the Early, Intermediate, Middle and Late Bronze Age, as well as the Iron Age I and II, the Persian, Hellenistic, Roman,Finkelstein and Lederman, 1997, p. 518 the ByzantineDauphin, 1998, p. 835 and Crusader/Ayyubid periods have been found. The village was abandoned after the 1187 defeat of the Crusaders at the hands of Sultan Saladin and the ensueing destruction of Christian sites. At the ruins of the Crusader watchtower (al-Burj), residential remains from the Mamluk period were discovered.Keio University, Archaeological Excavations and Development of Resources for Tourism at Beitin (Bethel), website of the Japan Consortium for International Cooperation in Cultural Heritage Independent Administrative Instituti. Accessed 15 April 2019. The village was only reestablished in the 19th century under Ottoman rule. Chalcolithic period Human settlement at the site of Beitin dates back to the Chalcolithic period. Archaeological excavations in 1950 uncovered flint tools, pottery and animal bones from that time. Bronze Age In the Early Bronze Age (around 3200 BCE) normally nomadic populations settled in the area. Canaanite tombs, houses and olive presses were discovered to the north and southeast of the village. The remains of a Canaanite temple were also excavated by archaeologists. In the Middle Bronze Age (around 1750 BCE) its status was elevated from a village to a fortified Canaanite town which is believed to be biblical Luz.Luza, also Bethel - (Beitin) Studium Biblicum Franciscanum - Jerusalem. 2000-12-19. Two city gates dating to this period have been excavated, one in the northeast and the other northwest of the wall. A second temple was built in Luz during this period, but was destroyed as a result of an earthquake. Iron Age =Biblical reference= Beitin has been identified as the biblical Bethel, the site where Jacob slept and dreamt of the angels coming up and down a ladder ().Easton, 1893, p. 94 Some scholars believe that Bethel was located on the site of the ruins surrounding Beitin.Trisdam, 1865, pp. 164-166 According to Jewish tradition, Jacob encountered God in Luz and renamed the town Bethel or \\"house of God.\\" However, based on a reading of the biblical Book of Joshua (), which says mebeit-el luzah (\\"from Bethel to Luz\\"), Luz and Bethel may have been two different places. Byzantine period In Byzantine times, Bethel held annual festivals on October 18. The population was Eastern Orthodox Christian and monks from the Sinai Peninsula, particularly Zosimas of Palestine, were known to have visited the town. Early Muslim period The church fell into ruin after the Islamic Rashidun army conquered the area. Crusader & Ayyubid periods The church was rebuilt by the Crusaders in the 12th century. During the Crusader period, the village was given as fief by Baldwin V of Jerusalem to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.Conder and Kitchener, 1883, SWP III, p. 11 After the Crusaders were defeated by the Ayyubid forces of Saladin in 1187, the church was destroyed and the village was abandoned. Ottoman period The ruins of Bethel in the mid-19th century The region had been part of the Ottoman Empire since 1517 and after Beitin was reestablished, the town came under the administration of the Mutasarrif (\\"Governorate\\") of Jerusalem. In the early 19th century, people from Transjordan and other places migrated to BeitinLutfiyya, 1966, p. 36 and built a mosque near the site of the old church. Visit Palestine: Bittin Visit Palestine. In 1838 Edward Robinson noted Beitin as a place \\"in ruins or deserted,\\" located immediately north of Jerusalem.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, Appendix 2, p. 122 In 1863 Victor Gu√©rin found the village to have 400 inhabitants,Gu√©rin, 1869, pp. 14-26 while an Ottoman village list from around 1870 showed that Beitin had an adult male population of 140, in a total of 55 houses (thus excluding women and children).Socin, 1879, p. 148. It was noted in the Bire DistrictHartmann, 1883, p. 127 also noted 55 houses In 1882 the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine described Beitin as a village \\"built on the side of a flat spur which rises slightly on the north. On the south-east is a flat dell, with good fig and pomegranate gardens, and there are other fig-trees round the village and among the houses. The cottages have a ruinous appearance, with rough stone walls. There is one square white house in two stories, which is visible from a great distance. The ground is very open, and the slopes gentle; the village slopes down gradually south-east. The surrounding ground is quite bare of trees, of white chalk, very barren and stony on the south; of hard limestone cropping up on the north; the fields divided off by low drystone walls. The contrast of the grey rocks, the red ploughland and the dark green figs is very striking. The remains of a good-sized tower exist towards the north, and on the south the walls of a church of Crusading date, once dedicated to St. Joseph. The population is stated at 400. The place is supplied from a fine spring on the south, which wells up in a circular basin. The spring is double, and was surrounded with a large reservoir, 314 feet long north-west and south- east, by 217 feet; of massive stones. The eastern and southern walls are standing about 10 feet high. The spring is perennial...\\" Conder and Kitchener, 1882, SWP II, pp. 295-296 In 1896 the population of Betin was estimated to be about 360 persons.Schick, 1896, p. 121 In 1907, small gardens and a few old tombs were found in the vicinity, and the Muslim population was known for its strength and fearlessness.Grant, 1907, p. 218 British Mandate period In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Baitin had a population of 446; all Muslims,Barron, 1923, Table VII, Sub- district of Ramallah, p. 16 increasing at the time of the 1931 census to 566, still all Muslim, in 135 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 47 In the 1945 statistics the population was 690 Muslims,Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics, 1945, p. 26 while the total land area was 4,764 dunams, according to an official land and population survey.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics.

Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 161 Jordanian period In the wake of the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, and after the 1949 Armistice Agreements, Beitin came under Jordanian rule. In 1961, a Jordanian census found the population to be 1,017.Government of Jordan, Department of Statistics, 1964, p. 24 It was further noted (note 2) that it was governed by a mukhtar. Post-1967 After the Six-Day War in 1967, Beitin has, with the rest of the West Bank, been held under Israeli occupation. The population in the 1967 census conducted by the Israeli authorities was 958, of whom 134 originated from the Israeli territory. After the 1995 accords, 19,1% of the village land is classified as Area B, while the remaining 80.9% is defined as Area C land (full Israeli control). Beitin village land has also been taken in order to construct the illegal Israeli outpost Givat Asaf.Beitin (village profile), ARIJ, pp. 17-19Nahum Barnea, 'Beitunian nights: The IDF in the West Bank', Ynet 18 March 2016. On 19 December, 2011, Israeli settlers were accused of carrying out a second price tag attack in only four days, in which five Palestinian-owned cars were burnt and the walls of several houses were sprayed with graffiti. During the first incident (15 December, 2011), the assailants not only vandalized a mosque, but also attacked an IDF military base in the West Bank, injuring a top Israeli commander. According to witnesses of the second incident, the Israeli army dispersed the settlers without arresting any of them, presumably also those who attacked the Israeli commander, although four days earlier the incident had prompted Israeli Prime-Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to say: \\"We won't let them attack our soldiers. We won't let them ignite a religious war with our neighbors. We won't let them desecrate mosques. We won't let them harm Jews or Arabs.\\" Landmarks Church ruins The ruins of the Byzantine church are known in Arabic as \\"al-Muqater\\" or \\"Khirbet al-Kenise\\" (\\"Ruins of the Church\\").Conder and Kitchener, 1882, SWP II, p. 305 According to R√∂hricht, when the Crusaders arrived, they found a ruined church. They built another and placed it first under the Abbey of St. Joseph of Arimathea, later under the Canons of the Holy Sepulcher.R√∂hricht, 1887, ZDPV 10, pp. 207, 292 The ruins of the church were drawn in the 1880s.Wilson, c1881, vol 1, pp. 219 (ill.), 221Pringle, 1993, pp. 104 -105 Tower ruins (\\"al-Burj\\") Ruins of al-Burj, 1935 Another ruin, called \\"al- Burj Beitin\\" (\\"the Tower of Beitin\\") or simply al-Burj is located in the western part of the town. They were also drawn in the 1880s.Wilson, c1881, vol 1, p. 217 (ill.) The ruins of the Burj are about 1 meter tall, and apparently built on the older ruins of a Byzantine monastery.Finkelstein and Lederman, 1997, p. 522 Some have believed that it was constructed on the site where Abraham built an altar.Conder and Kitchener, 1882, SWP II, p. 307 According to biblical scholar Edward Robinson who visited Palestine in the 19th century, al-Burj Beitin consisted of dilapidated stones that used to form part of a fortress and a Greek church.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol. 2, pp. 125-130. Al- Burj was used as a watch tower by the Crusaders.

He was a son of the weather god Te≈°≈°ub and the solar goddess Arinniti according to their mythology. His wife was the goddess Hatepuna, though he was also paired with ≈†epuru and Ka≈°·∏´a at various cultic centres. Telipinu was honored every nine years with an extravagant festival in the autumn at ·∏™an·∏´ana and Ka≈°·∏´a, wherein 1000 sheep and 50 oxen were sacrificed and the symbol of the god, an oak tree, was replanted. He was also invoked formulaically in a daily prayer for King Mur≈°ili II under the latter's reign. The Telipinu Myth is an ancient Hittite myth about Telipinu, whose disappearance causes all fertility to fail, both plant and animal: In order to stop the havoc and devastation, the gods seek Telipinu but fail to find him. Hannahanna, the mother goddess, sent a bee to find him; when the bee did, stinging Telipinu and smearing wax on him, the god grew angry and began to wreak destruction on the world. Finally, Kamru≈°epa, goddess of magic, calmed Telipinu by giving his anger to the Doorkeeper of the Underworld. In other references it is a mortal priest who prays for all of Telipinu's anger to be sent to bronze containers in the underworld, from which nothing escapes.The Ancient Near East, J.B.Pickard, page 88. In either case, it is difficult to determine anything about the nature of Telipinu from this myth, as myths along the same pattern have also been found featuring the unrelated gods Anzili and Zukki. It has been suggested that Telipinu endured in later mythology as the Greek Telephus and the Caucasian Telepia, but this identification is uncertain. In addition, his name was adopted by several kings, such as the Hittite monarch Telipinu.

Description The cartridge was developed for the United States and secretly produced in quantity too late for its intended use during World War I. The United States scrapped the weapons built for the cartridge between the world wars. France adopted weapons for the cartridge and those weapons saw combat use; so the cartridge is best known by its French name. The French military were introduced to the cartridge when the US demonstrated the Pedersen device after the end of World War I in Le Mans and again when John Browning exhibited a carbine in the same caliber in 1920. The US .30 Pedersen cartridge (Auto Pistol Ball Cartridge caliber .30 Model of 1918 or .30-18 Automatic) used in the Pedersen device was the basis for the 7.65√ó20mm Longue.

Rabbi Neuwirth is a prominent student of Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach, and the book generally follows Rabbi Auerbach's opinions. The book discusses practical situations such as driving to a hospital on Shabbat in an emergency. The book rules in accordance with Rabbi Moses Isserles (the Rema), i.e. according to the practice of Ashkenazic Jews. Because the book is popular and Sephardic Jews wish to use it also, Rabbi Yehuda Lavi Ben-David wrote a commentary of notes called Badey Hashulchan ( translation: \\"Poles of the table\\") which delineates the opinions of Sephardic poskim. The second edition of Shemirat Shabbat Kehilchatah has been translated to English and published by Feldheim. Volumes Two volumes came out: # The original volume; discusses which acts are permitted or prohibited to do on Shabbat. (◊©◊û◊ï◊® ◊ê◊™ ◊ô◊ï◊ù ◊î◊©◊ë◊™ - Guard the Shabbat day) # Published many years later; discusses the halachot of Kiddush and davening (prayer) of Shabbat. (◊ñ◊õ◊ï◊® ◊ê◊™ ◊ô◊ï◊ù ◊î◊©◊ë◊™ ◊ú◊ß◊ì◊©◊ï - Remember the Shabbat day to sanctify it) Controversy The book has been published in two different versions. After the first version was published, Rabbi Neuwirth was pressured to change many of his rulings, so in the second version many stringencies (chumrahs) were added, and the footnotes stated that there was an alternative lenient opinion. Rabbi Yaakov Yisrael Kanievsky attacked the book in a sharply worded footnote in his book Chayei Olam, and some other rabbis from the Lithuanian tradition supported him. However, the prominent Gedolim who wrote glowing Haskamos (letters of approbation) to the book presumably disagreed. Besides Rabbi Auerbach, these include Rabbi Yechezkel Abramsky, Rav Moshe Feinstein, Rabbi Yosef Breuer, and Rabbi Yechiel Yaakov Weinberg. Moreover, in 1993, about two years before his death, Rabbi Auerbach published a collection of footnotes and corrections to Shemirat Shabbat Kehilchatah, thus further strengthening its stature as an accepted work of halakhic decision-making.

It is variable in appearance and similar to other species of goldfields (Lasthenia); it is probably the result of a cross between Lasthenia chrysantha and Lasthenia glabrata, which grow throughout its range. The stem may be branched or not and it bears hairless, linear leaves up to 8 centimeters long. Atop the hairless or sparsely hairy stems are inflorescences of flower heads with fused, hairless phyllaries. The head contains many yellow disc florets with a fringe of small yellow ray florets.

It was added to the National Priorities List in 1983 when arsenic groundwater contamination was found in the Milltown area. The contamination resulted from a massive flood three years after its construction in 1905, which washed millions of tons of mine waste into the Clark Fork River, ultimately ending up behind the Milltown Dam. Since 1992, the site has been a part of the Clark Fork River Superfund Complex, consisting of three major sites (the other two in Anaconda and Butte) along a 120-mile stretch of the Clark Fork River. The Complex is the largest and most expensive Superfund site in the United States.EPA Milltown Reservoir Sediments page, epa.gov; accessed May 9, 2015. Overview The Milltown Dam () was an earth-fill gravity-type hydroelectric dam on the Clark Fork river in Missoula County, in the western part of Montana. The dam was located about seven miles east of Missoula, Montana, at the confluence of the Blackfoot River with the Clark Fork. Built in 1908 by copper mining tycoon William A. Clark, it was meant to supply hydroelectricity to his sawmills in nearby Bonner, Montana. Clark's sawmills supplied the giant timbers used to shore up the walls of the mine shafts in Butte. Since the 1870s, the Anaconda and Butte areas had been mined as one of the richest deposits of copper sulfate ever found in North America. With the dam just months old, however, a record flood on the Clark Fork washed tons of toxic mining sediment downstream, where it settled at the base of the dam to remain until remediation began, with a cumulative total of around 6.6 million cubic yards of sediment contaminated with arsenic, lead, zinc, copper, and other metals in the former reservoir bed. Superfund designation and study In 1981, through a routine Missoula County water quality study, four wells in Bonner that served 35 households, were found to be contaminated with heavy metals. The Environmental Protection Agency and the Montana Department of Environmental Quality closed the wells and began to look into the cause of the contamination of Milltown area groundwater. Two years later, in September 1983, it was determined that the contamination was the result of a buildup of heavy metal laden sediment from years of intensive mining upstream by the Anaconda Copper Mining Company. That finding resulted in the addition of the Milltown Dam Site to the initial National Priorities List. Review began immediately by the EPA to determine the Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) and to develop a plan to fix the groundwater contamination problem. In 1977 Anaconda Copper was purchased by the Atlantic Richfield Corporation (ARCO), which assumed liability for the damages. In 2000, ARCO was purchased by British Petroleum. In 1992, through the action of committed citizens in the Deer Lodge Valley, the EPA designated the Clark Fork River upstream from the Milltown Dam to the Warm Springs Ponds part of the Superfund Site.Milltown Reservoir Sediments Superfund Site, epa.gov; accessed May 9, 2015. In 1995, the study of the extent of site contamination was completed by the EPA and ARCO. A subsequent feasibility study attempted to determine how to restore the Milltown groundwater. That study was halted, however, as the unusually wet winter of 1996 sent a large ice jam down the Blackfoot River and into the Milltown Reservoir, causing a severe scouring of the contaminated sediment in the reservoir bed and caused a fish kill downstream. Fearful of a major uncontrolled release of water (and sediment), officials quickly drew down the level of the reservoir, stranding the ice pack before it could cause any more damage.Milltown Reservoir Sediments Superfund Site, nytimes.com; accessed 9 May 2015. The EPA immediately began to examine the extent of the damage, and after a contentious public discussion, it became clear that the threats of continued releases of contaminated sediments into the downstream fishery must be addressed in the final remediation plan. Over 10,000 residents of Western Montana sent public comments in support of complete dam removal and full cleanup. In 2003 the State of Montana, through its Natural Resource Damage Program, drafted a conceptual plan for the restoration of the Milltown Dam site. NRDP Restoration Road Map In December 2004, the final remediation plan was released by the EPA, calling for the removal of more than two million cubic yards of contaminated sediment and the removal of the Milltown Dam. In August 2005, a consent decree was signed by the parties, allowing the project to move out of the planning phase and onto the ground. After over 20 years of study and litigation, work began on the Milltown Site on June 1, 2006 with a drawdown of the Milltown Reservoir. Contaminated reservoir sediments were hauled to an upstream repository near the town of Opportunity, a move opposed by some local residents. Three Rs of the Superfund project Remediation Sediment removal as part of the remediation in the fall of 2008 Remediation is defined as the cleanup of hazardous substances to protect human health and the environment. The remediation on the Milltown/Clark Fork River Site is being led by the EPA and its chief contractor, Envirocon. The remediation phase includes the removal of three million tons of contaminated sediment and the Milltown Dam itself. Remediation goals include the restoration of the Milltown Aquifer and the downriver water quality as well as the trout fishery through the confluence area. Work on the ground began in the summer of 2006 and the remediation phase should come to a close by December 2009, with the project leadership shifting over to the State of Montana for the restoration of the area. Restoration The initial stream bank stabilization being done upstream from the Milltown Dam site underway by the state's contractor, Envirocon Restoration in the context of Milltown is the creation of a natural river and floodplain following dam and sediment removal. With funds gained through a Natural Resource Damage Program lawsuit against ARCO, the State of Montana is leading the restoration of the confluence area to a natural state. Restoration work began in summer 2008 and ramped up as the sediment removal drew to a close. The restoration work includes the sculpting of a new river channel, the creation of fluvial wetlands, bank reinforcement, and reestablishment of natural vegetation cover.State of Montana Natural Resource Damage Program Restoration Road Map Restoration work was scheduled to be finished by 2012. Redevelopment A conceptual design for the proposed state park Redevelopment is the effort to return former hazardous waste sites to productive use. The plan for the redevelopment of the Milltown area includes the creation of a state park with a trail system connecting the surrounding communities. In 2007, a conceptual design for the park was created in cooperation by the Milltown Superfund Redevelopment Working Group and the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Parks, the National Park Service Rivers and Trails Program, the Idaho-Montana Chapter of the American Society of Landscape Architects. In 2009, a grant proposal for the initial park development was submitted to the Natural Resource Damage Program.Milltown/Two Rivers Park Conceptual Plan, Milltown Superfund Site Redevelopment Working Group See also *Clark Fork River *Anaconda Copper *ARCO *British Petroleum *List of Superfund sites in Montana References External links *Clark Fork River Technical Assistance Committee *Clark Fork Coalition *Two Rivers History *EPA Region 8 Milltown Reservoir Sediments Milltown Oral History Project (University of Montana Archives) Category:Dams in Montana Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 1908 Category:Buildings and structures in Deer Lodge County, Montana Category:Buildings and structures in Granite County, Montana Category:Hydroelectric power plants in Montana Category:Buildings and structures in Missoula County, Montana Category:Buildings and structures in Powell County, Montana Category:Buildings and structures in Silver Bow County, Montana Category:Superfund sites in Montana Category:1983 establishments in Montana Category:Historic American Engineering Record in Montana Category:1908 establishments in Montana ","title":"Milltown Reservoir Superfund Site"},{"id":"17631321","text":"Coventry Mall is a shopping mall in North Coventry Township, Pennsylvania (Pottstown, Pennsylvania).

Who was Tahurwaili, the great king? Journal of Cuneiform Studies, vol. 26 No 2 April 1974 He ruled sometime between Telepinu and Zidanta II, but otherwise the placement of his rule in the sequence of kings is uncertain. Often he is put after Aluwamna and even Hantili II, based on the style of his seal (see, for example, History of the Hittites), but such decision is speculative. Since he is mentioned in one of the Telepinu's letters (KUB 26:77) and is supposed to be Telepinu's cousin, it makes sense to assume that he ruled right after Telepinu. Here is the reasoning by Bin-Nun: we know that Aluwamna was exiled by Telepinu, so it would be difficult for him to come to the throne right after Telepinu's death. Therefore, it makes sense to assume that the usurper could come to power for a while. Putting Tahurwaili's reign after Hantili II (son of Aluwamna, who is son-in-law of Telepinu) means moving Tahurwaili at least two generations down the time line. Tahurwaili made a parity treaty with Eheya of Kizzuwatna. Its terms were very similar to those between Paddati≈°≈°u and Hantili II. These kings are usually assumed, but neither of the treaties names a Hittite king.

Piratas de Campeche On May 15, 2019, Outman signed with the Piratas de Campeche of the Mexican League. He was released on July 16, 2019. Pitching style Outman throws five pitches, relying most heavily on a four-seam fastball at 93‚Äì96 mph. He also throws a two-seamer (90‚Äì95), a slider (80‚Äì83), a changeup (78‚Äì83), and a curveball (low-to-mid 70s). His changeup is not thrown to left-handed hitters, but is a common pitch against right-handers. He uses his slider a great deal against lefties, but typically uses it against righties only in 2-strike counts. Throughout his career, the slider has been his best swing-and-miss pitch, with a whiff rate of 46% through June 2012.

The new HMS St Vincent was commissioned on 1 June 1927, originally like its predecessor as a training establishment for boys and juniors. On the outbreak of the Second World War, the boys were evacuated to the Isle of Man, where they merged with those evacuated from HMS Caledonia to form HMS St George, which was formally established in 1939. HMS St Vincent meanwhile became a training establishment for officers of the Fleet Air Arm and an overflow for the Royal Navy barracks. A signal school was also established. A torpedo training section was opened on 22 July 1940. St Vincent reverted to being a boy's training establishment after the end of the war, and reopened as such on 1 December 1945. It continued to function as such until 1968, when it was decided to close St Vincent. The official closing ceremony was held on 8 December 1968, with the white ensign being lowered for the last time on 2 April 1969. The base was then handed over to the land agent the following day, 3 April 1969. St Vincent College now stands on the site.

The elevation of Graniteville is above sea level. Demographics  History  First settled in 1850, it was the original town in Eureka Township and an early gold mining center for Nevada County.Thompson, Thomas H. and West, Albert A. (1970 ed.) History of Nevada County -1880, p. 62. Brown & Dallison. (1856; reprinted 2001 by Maria E. Fields Brower), op. cit., p. 15; Nash, James,cThe Unionc July 19, 1998, Tiny Mining Town Beats Odds, p. A-9. As was popular at the time, the town was named Eureka, the state motto (‚ÄúI have found it‚Äù), in honor of California's admission in September, 1850, to the Union.Gudde, E. G. (1975) California Gold Camps, University of California Press. Many other early Nevada County sites carried the Eureka name, including Eureka Hill, Eureka Mine, Eureka School District, Eureka Heights Residential District in Grass Valley, and Eureka House, an early tavern and inn built in 1850-1851.E.g., Nevada Journal, April 18, 1851; Sept. 13,1851. Due to its proximity to another town of Eureka in Sierra County, however, as early as the 1850s it was often referred to as Eureka South to avoid confusion.Lee, Clinton H. Graniteville Part I, (hereinafter Graniteville I) Nevada County Historical Society Bulletin, Vol. 26, No.2, (Apr. 1972) p. 2. In 1857, Goddard's Map recorded the town as Eureka South.Gudde, op.cit. When a United States Post Office was established on August 26, 1867, the town's name officially became Graniteville, because there already was a Eureka post office in Humboldt County.Janicot, Michel (1994) A History of Nevada County Post Offices, p. 19. However locals and historians continued to call it Eureka for some time. Graniteville was the first settled town in Eureka Township, situated on Poorman CreekThere are other Poorman's Creeks in the gold country. Local lore has it that the name was given to areas so rich that a person who could not mine a pound of gold in a day was a 'poor man.\\" Graniteville I p. 3. between the Middle and South Yuba Rivers.Thompson and West, op. cit., p. 62; Brown & Dallison, op. cit., pp. 14-15. By the mid 1850s, Eureka had a winter population of about 1000 residents, although dry season population often dropped to about 200 individuals due to poor water supply.Graniteville Historical Marker found in Comstock, David A. and Zimmerman, Bernard (2017 electronic edition) Exploring Nevada County, #141. As in many similar early mining towns, early Eureka was a raucous environment, populated mostly by men and used to settling disputes with violence. For example, in January, 1854, a riot erupted between Irish and English miners over priority to a claim. Shots were exchanged and a woman passer-by was wounded. The involved parties were arrested and five individuals were fined $60.00 each, a substantial sum at the time.Thompson and West, op. cit., pp. 62-3. In spite of its somewhat unruly beginnings, the town established stores, hotels, a livery stable, saloons, a bakery and a brewery.Thompson and West, op. cit., pp. 63, 165. By 1855, there were enough local children to warrant a school.Nevada Transcript, Nov. 5, 1867; Thompson and West, op. cit., p. 141. By the 1870s, a Catholic church had been established.Thompson and West, op. cit., p. 63. Eureka was a stage line terminus and the last local town for outfitting miners for the higher elevations,Thompson and West, op. cit., p. 123-4; Lardner, W.B. and Brock, M.J. (1924) History of Placer and Nevada Counties California, p.325. along with being an important distribution point for reservoir waters that were fed via ditches to the lower hydraulic mines.Thompson and West, op. cit., p. 63; Poingdestre, op. cit., p. 107. It was connected to the world's first long distance telephone line, established in 1878 to link the mining communities around the San Juan Ridge.Graniteville I op. cit., p. 2. It was also an important stop on the Henness Pass road connecting Marysville and Nevada County with what was to become Nevada.Id. Establishment of a United States Post Office in 1867 allowed for tri-weekly mail delivery by stage from Nevada City when weather allowed. When inclement weather prohibited stage delivery, foot express delivery from Moore's Flat, about 6 miles west, was periodically feasible.Grass Valley Union, November 17, 1867. As of 1867, Eureka was one of the few Nevada County towns that had not suffered from disastrous fires.Bean, E. F. (1867) Bean's History and Directory of Nevada County, p. 401. On August 12, 1878, however, fire destroyed much of the original town, at a loss of $50,000.00.Thompson and West, op. cit., p. 63; Grass Valley Union, July 29, 2000, Fire Swept Town. By then, under the name of Graniteville, the town partially had come back to life, and by 1880 there was a population of around 300.  Mining  Gold mining started in 1850 around Eureka, with the diggings opening in 1851.Thompson and West, op. cit., p. 62; For a discussion of the Graniteville mining district, see MacBoyle, Errol (1918) Mines and Mineral Resources of Nevada County,, pp. 11-13. During the early years, little capital was needed to begin mining activity, as gold was easily found. ‚ÄúRestless, roving prospectors‚Äù were able to find surface gold with little effort in the rivers and ravines.Bean, op. cit., p. 401. During the early 1850s, numerous ditches for water transport were dug, one of the largest being the 30 mile long ‚ÄúMemphis Race.‚Äù Started in 1853 by Dr. James Weaver, and constructed over several years, it was built to take water from the Middle Yuba to the town.Brown & Dallison, op. cot., pc 15c Bean, op. cit., p. 401; 67, Thompson and West, op. cit., p. 171. Due to poor and short-sighted mining practices, however, and the fact that early miners wanted quick access to the gold, placer mining around Eureka was nearly played out within a few years, businesses closed, and the town struggled.Bean,, op. cit., p. 401. By about 1856, Eureka was in decline, with a greatly reduced population. Some quartz veins were discovered in the early and mid 1850s, but this initial quartz mining momentum did not last. In spite of building some solid mines and stamp mills around Eureka, the endeavors were not long-lasting.Thompson and West, op. cit., p. 186. A secondary effort at quartz mining, however, rejuvenated the region by about 1867. An influx of new miners revived the severely decreasing population, which by early 1866 had dropped to 20 residents. In May, 1866, Eureka's population was hovering around 400, with it remaining stable at about 350 for several years, due to mining success.Thompson and West, op. cit., p. 63; Poingdestre, op. cit., p. 107 The most extensive quartz mining in the region was done on the gravel range along the flats, partially worked by hydraulic mining.Bean, op. cit., pp. 30-32; Thompson and West, op. cit., p. 186. The Eureka Quartz District was similar in ledge size and formation to those in the Nevada District and equally successful. Some of the most profitable quartz ledges near Eureka included the Jim, the Liberty, the Birchville, the Veatch and Powell, the Dillon and Russel, the Black and Young, the Mohawk, the Booth, and the Eclipse. One of the largest mines was the Boston Mine, owned by the Eureka Lake and Yuba Land Company, and formed by the consolidation of several earlier, smaller claims. Hydraulic mining continued until it was largely shut down by the 1884 Sawyer decision, which banned the discharge of tailings (gravel which had been stripped of its gold) into the Yuba River, of which Poorman Creek was a tributary.The Sawyer decision is reported as Woodruff v. North Bloomfield Gravel Mining Co., 18 F. 753 (CCD Cal. 1884).  Eureka Township  Eureka Township was an early civil township located in the northern portion of Nevada County, with borders extending to the summit of the Sierra Nevada mountains.Thompson and West, op. cit., pp. 55-9. Aside from Eureka, other early towns in the township included Moore's Flat, Orlean's Flat, Woolsey's Flat and South Fork. Eureka Township functioned as an organized political body during the formative mining years, as noted by the fact that in 1867, several local men filled positions as justices and constables for the township.  Graniteville in the 20th and 21st Centuries  While mining was greatly diminished by the start of the 20th century, some activity surfaced again in the 1930s and briefly in the mid-to-late 1940s after World War II.Lardner and Brock, op. cit., p.325; Nash J.,The Union, op. cit. In 1924, Graniteville still had an active school districtLardner, id, p. 411. and the Graniteville Post Office functioned until it was discontinued in 1959.Janicot, op. cit., p. 19.

Due to the fact that some residents are weekend and/or summer-time residents only, the actual population figure shifts regularly. Their existence is a hardy one, reminiscent in many ways of the town's pioneer days.Brown, Laura (Jan. 2, 2008) The Union, A Different Way of Life.

Performance art is presented in front of an audience embracing different forms of expressions like dance, theater, music, film and plastic art. She was born in 1956 in Armenia, the capital of the department of Quindio. Her initial studies were in acting and she developed her work towards the field of performance art, where she stood out as being at the vanguard of this artistic field in Colombia. Hincapi√© came from a dissociated discipline, at least in Colombia, called plastic art. Her performances were a reflection of a woman‚Äôs everyday life and a reflection of her detachment to material possessions. She had the capacity to captivate audiences with her every performances and the ability to win over the European performance art scene. She studied in France, Indonesia, India and Japan where she became a versatile artist with various cultural influences. In 1990 she obtained first prize at the XXXIII Salon of Colombian Artists with her work Una cosa es una cosa and became a member of the theatrical group 'Acto Latino' (Latin Act). Hincapi√© worked with very important Colombian and Mexican play directors, choreographers and script writers Alvaro Restrepo and Juan Monsalve in Una cosa es una cosa, Parquedades,Vitrina, and Historias Del Silencio. Her ease to adapt to roles and impact spectators made Hincapi√© among the best performance artist in the Colombian artistic scene. The Performance Art of Mar√≠a Teresa Hincapi√© proves to what extent the work of this Colombian artist who died from breast cancer on 18 January 2008 opened an indelible path for performance in the continent: her work was to be said as a complete fusion between artwork and everyday life, transforming a small space from which she did not only built a spiritual universe for herself, but also left it open for future generations.

Originally composed of three infantry battalions and two armoured squadrons, several individual units rotated through the brigade. Although a full brigade had been trained and armed by 1951, the success of the Inchon Landing meant that only 2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry (2PPCLI) was initially sent.Zuehlke 2001, p. 177. However, Chinese and North Korean forces subjected Canadian forces to fierce fighting throughout April 1951. 2PPCLI earned a Presidential Unit Citation for their actions during the Battle of Kapyong while serving with the 27th Commonwealth Brigade. It had detached from the 25th Brigade in order to leave for Korea in advance of the formation, and would later rejoin its Canadian brigade group. Formation When North Korea invaded their southern neighbour on 25 June 1950, the UN Security Council authorized member-nations to \\"...furnish such assistance to the Republic of Korea as may be necessary to repel the armed attack and to restore international peace and security in the area\\".Canada's Involvement in the Korean War Although the United States sent immediate military aid to South Korea, Canada did not initially prepare to send ground forces to the country (although three Royal Canadian Navy destroyers were present for a majority of the campaign). On 7 August 1950, Canada's government authorized the creation of the \\"Canadian Army Special Force\\". Originally, it was to comprise an armoured regiment, and the 2nd Battalions of each of Canada's permanent-force infantry regiments ‚Äì Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry, Royal Canadian Regiment, and Royal 22e R√©giment ‚Äì placed under the overall command of Brigadier General J.M. Rockingham. Initial operations in Korea Due to the massive success of the Inchon Landings, only the 2nd Battalion of Princess Patricia's was initially sent to Yokohama, and then onto Korea. By the time the transports arrived in Japan, however, the situation had changed significantly. China had sent substantial forces to the aid of North Korea, pushing UN-forces back into South Korea.Zuehlke 2001, p. 178. As a result, the PPCLI was sent directly to the front lines, located near Seoul, in mid‚ÄìFebruary. The first contact made with North Korean and Chinese forces came at the end of that month. In early March, United Nations forces initiated a counteroffensive against Chinese forces, while the Canadians moved into the Kapyong Valley near the 38th Parallel.Zuehlke 2001, p. 179. Battle of Kapyong In April 1951, the Chinese People's Liberation Army launched a series of massive offensives across the Korean front, with the intention of recapturing Seoul. American and South Korean forces quickly began to retreat, with Canadian and Australian forces holding Kapyong Valley, preventing Chinese forces from overwhelming the UN in Korea.

On the night of 28‚Äì29 May 1993, four young German men (ages 16‚Äì23) belonging to the far right skinhead scene, with neo-Nazi ties, set fire to the house of a large Turkish family in Solingen in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Three girls and two women died; fourteen other family members, including several children, were injured, some of them severely. The attack led to violent protests by Turks in several German cities and to large demonstrations of Germans expressing solidarity with the Turkish victims. In October 1995, the perpetrators were convicted of arson and murder and given prison sentences between 10 and 15 years. The convictions were upheld on appeal. Background In the early 1990s after German reunification, foreigners and especially asylum seekers were very controversial in Germany. The CDU party and the tabloid newspaper Bild Zeitung were the main forces calling for limiting their numbers. Several instances of anti-foreigner (xenophobic) violence preceded the Solingen attack. In December 1988, a German extreme-right militant, Josef Seller, set fire to the \\"Habermeier Haus\\" building in Schwandorf, Bavaria, killing the Turkish couple Fatma and Osman Can, together with their son Mehmet. The arson attack also took the life of a German citizen, J√ºrgen H√ºbner.H√ºrriyet Avrupa newspaper, Tuesday, December 11, 2012, p. 12. In September 1991, violent disturbances in Hoyerswerda forced the evacuation of an asylum seeker's hostel. During the three-day riot of Rostock-Lichtenhagen in August 1992, several thousand people surrounded a high-rise building and watched approvingly while militants threw Molotov cocktails. The Vietnamese inhabitants barely managed to survive by fleeing to the roof. In November 1992, an arson in M√∂lln perpetrated by extreme-rightist youth killed three Turks. In December 1992, large demonstrations protesting against xenophobia took place all over Germany, with over 700,000 participants. Several Neo-Nazi groups were outlawed by the end of 1992. On 26 May 1993, three days before the attack, the German Bundestag had resolved to change the German constitution (the Grundgesetz) to limit the numbers of asylum seekers. Previously, the constitution had granted every political refugee in the world a direct right to refugee status in Germany. The Solingen attack, with five people killed, was the most severe case of anti-foreigner violence in Germany at that time. One week later, an arson attack on a house in Frankfurt am Main, with 34 foreigners inside, was detected early and nobody died. A case of arson in an asylum seeker's hostel in L√ºbeck in 1996 in which 10 people died was never solved. a total of 135 foreigners have died in Germany as a result of similar xenophobic violence. Events According to the police report, fire broke out at the entrance of the house Untere Wernerstra√üe 81 at 1:38 am on 29 May 1993. The fire had been set with gasoline. Mevl√ºde Gen√ß, 50 years old at the time and the oldest member of the family, was able to climb out of a window and alert neighbors. She lost two daughters, two granddaughters and a niece that night. Fire fighters arrived after five minutes, but it was too late. G√ºrs√ºn ƒ∞nce, 27 years old, jumped out of a window and died. Her four-year-old daughter, whom she had held in her arms, survived. The girls Hatice Gen√ß (18 years old), G√ºlistan √ñzt√ºrk (12 years old), H√ºlya Gen√ß (9 years old) and Saime Gen√ß (4 years old) died in the flames. Bekir Gen√ß, 15 years old, jumped burning out of a window; he survived with severe injuries. A six-month-old infant and a three-year-old child suffered life-threatening injuries. Defendants The defendants were: * Felix K√∂hnen, a 16-year-old student at the time of the crime. His father was a doctor active in the peace movement and his mother an architect active in environmentalist causes. There were reports that Felix fell into right-wing circles because he felt unable to cope with the academic expectations of his parents. * Christian Reher, a 16-year-old student who grew up in children's homes. He lived close to the arson house and was the first to be arrested. He had previously distributed leaflets expressing his hatred of foreigners. * Christian Buchholz, 19 years old, working odd jobs. He was the son of a middle-class workman. His diary contained anti-foreigner writings. * Markus Gartmann, 23 years old, welfare recipient. As a youth, he was reportedly a loner. He was a member of the nationalist DVU party. All of them were members of the far right skinhead scene of Solingen and exercised together in a martial arts school. This school was later revealed to be run by an informant of the North Rhine-Westphalia domestic intelligence agency (the Verfassungsschutz).  Trials The trial, before five judges of D√ºsseldorf's Higher Regional Court, began in April 1994. Kohnen, Reher and Buchholz were charged as minors (limiting the maximal penalty to 10 years in prison), while Gartmann was charged as an adult. The prosecutors claimed hatred of foreigners as motive. Gartmann had confessed to police and he later confessed again before a magistrate with his lawyer present. He also apologized to the victims. According to the confession, Gartmann, Kohnen and Buchholz had clashed with foreigners at a party that night, met up with Reher and then, while drunk, decided to \\"frighten\\" some Turks. Towards the end of the trial, Gartmann withdrew his confession, claiming that it had been issued under duress and that he had been threatened with having to share a cell with Turks. Interviewed in prison four months after the verdict, he explained that he had given a false confession because police had convinced him that that was the only way to avoid a sentence of life in prison. Reher also confessed, but changed his story repeatedly, in the end claiming that he had acted alone. Kohnen and Buchholz denied any involvement. No hard evidence was found linking the defendants to the crime, in part because the police had treated the crime scene in a sloppy manner. Witnesses could not clarify the events. In October 1995, the four defendants were found guilty of murder, attempted murder and arson. The three defendants charged as minors received the maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and Gartmann was sentenced to 15 years in prison. The Federal Court of Justice of Germany confirmed the convictions on appeal in 1997. The Turkish family sued for civil damages and won. They received about 270,000 DM and a monthly pension for one severely burned victim. Aftermath Memorial in front of the Mildred-Scheel-Schule H√ºlyaplatz in Frankfurt- Bockenheim The memorial services were attended by several high-ranking German officials, with President Richard von Weizs√§cker giving the first speech. Chancellor Helmut Kohl was criticized for not visiting Solingen nor attending the memorial or burial services; he had denounced what he called \\"Beileidstourismus\\" (\\"condolence tourism\\") of other politicians. The case was widely reported in the international press. After a radio campaign in the Netherlands, 1.2 million postcards with the slogan \\"Ich bin woedend!\\" (\\"I am furious\\") were sent as a protest from there to German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. A memorial to commemorate the event was unveiled one year after the attack, in front of the Mildred-Scheel-Schule, a school that Hatice Gen√ß had attended. It shows two large metal figures ripping apart a swastika, surrounded by a large number of rings, each sponsored by an individual. Initially the city had agreed to a monument in the very center of the city, but then reneged, citing concerns that \\"social peace\\" might be jeopardized. The location of the arson at Untere Wernerstra√üe Nr. 81 is marked by five chestnut trees and a plaque. In Frankfurt-Bockenheim the H√ºlyaplatz commemorates the events with a statue of a man hammering at a swastika. In 1996 the German government presented Mevl√ºde Gen√ß with the Bundesverdienstkreuz am Band because she went on to advocate understanding and friendship between Turks and Germans after the attack. In 2008 Germany instituted the Gen√ß prize in her name to honor people who work for understanding and integration. One of the recipients was Kamil Kaplan, a Turk who in February 2008 had lost his wife, two daughters and his mother in a fire catastrophe in Ludwigshafen in which a total of nine people had died; right-wing arson had initially been suspected, but the case was later found to have been an accident. Kaplan, like Mevl√ºde Gen√ß, had called for peaceful cooperation between Turks and Germans. In 2012, Mevl√ºde Genc was nominated by the CDU state party to be a member of the 15th Federal Convention to elect the next German President. Two of the perpetrators were released early because of good behavior. In September 2005, another perpetrator, Christian Reher, was sent to four months in prison for having used the Hitler salute on two occasions. As of 2008, the surviving victims still live in Solingen, in a house built with donations and insurance money, protected by cameras and special fire windows.

The renovated Freight House is now home to three award-winning restaurants: Fiorella's Jack Stack Barbecue, Grunauer (German and Austrian food) and Lidia's. The building is located immediately east of the Stuart Hall Building, and it is connected via pedestrian bridge to Union Station. The pedestrian bridge was added in 2003, and its main component is an 1892 railroad span that had been sitting unused on the river bluffs until it was moved to its new location. The Freight House was originally constructed in 1887. The building housed freight unloaded from the trains until merchants picked up the freight and transported it to the numerous warehouses nearby. Redevelopment Over the years, the structure fell into severe disrepair until it was purchased by a group of investors in 1995. The long and wide Freight House would probably have been demolished, but the group of investors, led by Dan Clothier, envisioned developing three restaurants on the property. The first restaurant to open at the Freight House was Lidia‚Äôs Kansas City. Lidia's is an Italian restaurant that was opened by celebrity chef Lidia Bastianich in October 1998. The interior of the restaurant was designed by architect and designer David Rockwell. Fiorella's Jack Stack Barbecue was the second restaurant to open in the Freight House. It opened its third location at the west end of the building in Fall 2000, and it continues to occupy that location. Freight and passenger trains continue to pass just south of the long Freight House. Lidia's occupies the far right portion of the structure including the two- story area, Grunauer is located in the middle of the building, and Fiorella's Jack Stack Barbecue is at the west end. City Tavern opened in 2002 in the middle of the three Freight House restaurant spaces, and enjoyed success over the years until it closed in April 2010. Following the closing of City Tavern, acclaimed Austrian-born chef Peter Grunauer opened a Viennese restaurant in May 2010 in the space formerly occupied by City Tavern. The restaurant, known as Grunauer, is operated by Peter, his daughter Elisabeth, and his son Nicholas.

Early childhood and education Judith Ann Becker was born in November 26, 1938, in Manitowoc, Wisconsin.The New York Times Biographical Service, vol. 15. 1984 (July), p. 922. Her father did not provide for the family and leaving her mother and five siblings to take care of themselves. After her parents divorced, her mother worked in a factory for twenty-five years to support the family, while only having an 8th grade education. The Becker's grew up very poor and for a time lived in a re- converted chicken coop with no running water and an old wooden stove. After completing high school in 1957, Becker received a scholarship that provided the funds to attend the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point. Becker was originally a music major singing and playing the piano, however she was passionate about literature and language so she graduated with a bachelor's degree in English. As a student at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point, Judy Becker met and married Dick Goldsmith and later had a daughter named Rachel. Judy Goldsmith also received a master's degree from the State University of New York at Buffalo. National Organization for Women  Career  When Judy went into the job market in 1950, there were numerous ads for men and minimal for women, putting women at a significant disadvantage for employment opportunities. The ads, described by Judy, were geared towards women that read: \\"Needed: Attractive, Woman, Receptionist\\" for example. Goldsmith began her career as a college English professor at the University of Wisconsin and then became involved in NOW shortly thereafter. She and her sister became involved in NOW together in 1974, after being invited by a friend to attend. After a few months of being involved, Judy was elected president of the Manitowoc County chapter in Wisconsin, which went on to become the first statewide NOW organization. Judy played a large role in the development of the state chapter and was later elected to be president of the state chapter. Fifteen years later she became a national leader of NOW and moved to Washington, D.C. In 1982, while Goldsmith was head of NOW, the organization succeeded in increasing the number of women serving in state legislatures. Goldsmith advocated a more partisan direction for the formerly more inclusive NOW and adopted liberal positions on issues such as Reaganomics. During the same year, NOW controversially endorsed Frank Lautenberg, the male Democratic Senate opponent of New Jersey's Republican feminist Congresswoman, Millicent Fenwick, due to Fenwick's support of Reagan's economic agenda despite her pro-women's rights stances. Lautenberg defeated Fenwick by a narrow margin. Goldsmith believed that much discrimination had roots in economics and survival issues.http://www.icue.com/portal/site/iCue/iCueSearchResultsNavItem/?selectedValue=ADVANCED&terms;=Steinem&showResults;=yes# During her tenure she also worked with Coretta Scott-King on the 1983 march commemorating the 20th anniversary of the historic \\"March on Washington\\" by Martin Luther King, Jr.  Smeal v Goldsmith  Eleanor Smeal was Judy Goldsmith's predecessor as NOW president as well as her mentor.http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=a139b0ff-981b-40fb-8229-08a4c51cf8b5%2540sessionmgr114&vid;=4&hid;=106 Smeal supported Goldsmith during the 1982 election, partly because Smeal was not eligible for reelection herself. Smeal unofficially backed Goldsmith's entire slate, the goal being to endorse and hopefully continue Smeal's policies. An article from 1982 in the Washington Post credits Goldsmith's win \\"as an affirmation of the policies that built NOW into the nation's foremost voice on women's rights, despite the group's inability last year (1981) to win ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment\\" under Smeal's lead. Two others from Goldsmith's slate, Alice Chapman and Mary Jean Collins, were elected both with Smeal's unofficial backing. However, the other positions within the organization were not all filled by the slate that Goldsmith headed, which therefore made it unclear how the voting delegates felt about Smeal's past leadership, as the executive vice president was won by an independent, attorney Barbara Timmer, who pledged a wider, more activist approach than Smeal's, and the secretary position was won by Kathy Webb, who was also an independent. As Goldsmith's presidency continued, the original support she had from Smeal appeared to slip away, as rumors and speculations surfaced that Smeal was going to run for the presidency again.http://resolver.ebscohost.com/openurl?sid=EBSCO%253aedsgbc&genre;=article&issn;=03624331&ISBN;=&volume;=&issue;=&date;=19850608&spage;=&pages;=&title;=The+New+York+Times&atitle;=SMEAL+AND+GOLDSMITH+FIGHT+FOR+LEADERSHIP+OF+NOW&aulast;=Brozan%252c+Nadine&id;=DOI&site;=ftf- live When Smeal announced she was running in the 1985 election, she said that it was due to her belief that Goldsmith was too moderate and did not focus on the issues that were important to herself. Goldsmith often met with politicians, and felt that progress could only be made when women were elected into political positions. On the issues of abortion and equal rights, Goldsmith said, It is on our agenda but it is not the most propitious time to bring it up. We are not interested in exercises in futility. We must change the political landscape and get more women elected before we try again\\". Smeal, however, said that there \\"was a wish that NOW become more outspoken, assertive and publicly active on a number of issues,\\" and that she favored a national program for direct action now. This can't wait for another 10 years, she said. We can't decide that we want it and then do nothing\\". Goldsmith said, in defense of her methods, that Loud may be good, but it is not only the level of decibels that is heard\\". Their methods were seen as very different and is what led to the intense battle for the presidency. For example, the two leaders approached anti-abortion terrorism in different ways. Goldsmith sent a telegram to President Reagan, demanding an investigation, and then later called on President Reagan, when she received no response, by telling reporters how she felt during a White House pickett. Smeal, however, led the first March for Women's Lives in 1986, which drew over 150,000 people to Washington and Los Angeles in support of women's reproductive rights. Goldsmith believed in accomplishing NOW's goals through politics while Smeal felt rallies, demonstrations, and protests were the better method, illustrated when Smeal said \\"It's time to go back on the streets, go on the campuses and show we're the majority\\" in 1985. The 1985 election was heated and intense but Smeal won over Goldsmith. Goldsmith was the incumbent seeking her second term, and NOW presidents had traditionally served two consecutive two-year terms. Members of NOW's 35-member national board and its state coordinators supported Goldsmith by a 2 to 1 margin, and she appeared to have more supporters at the convention's plenary sessions. It was reported by the SunSentinal in the 1985 article Smeal Wins Battle For Top NOW Post, \\"the factors contributing to Mrs. Smeal's victory were personality differences between the two candidates, a faulty sample ballot, the last-minute decision by a NOW officer to endorse Mrs. Smeal, a legal vote-brokering system, and a surprisingly vitriolic final campaign speech by Mrs. Goldsmith\\". Before the election Goldsmith, was believed to be leading, yet Smeal defeated Goldsmith by the margin of 839 to 703. Goldsmith's final campaign speech may have been what cost her votes, many said, in which she \\"uncharacteristically attacked her opponent in hard-hitting language, had lost her some votes. She accused Mrs. Smeal of, among other things, 'duplicity, character assassination and a ward-boss political mentality\\". It was also reported in Smeal Wins Battle For Top NOW Post, that Goldsmith seemed to be trying at the last minute to reverse her image as a president who preferred coalition-building to one who might be comfortable with her opponent's combative style. Overall the 1985 election between Goldsmith and not only her predecessor, but her mentor as well proved to be \\"one of the most heated presidential elections in the [then] 19-year history of the National Organization for Women\\".  Retirement and legacy  After her tenure as President of NOW she served in various leadership positions, including Dean of the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìFond du Lac, retiring in 2002, though she remains active. Today, the University awards the \\"Judy Goldsmith Young Woman Leadership Award\\" in her honor. While using her musical background, Judy now plays piano at a nursing home in Fond du Lac and ballroom dances as frequently as possible.

Older types are a metal scraper, which scrapes the ink off the surface, and an eraser similar to a rubber pencil eraser, but with additional abrasives, such as sand, incorporated. Fibreglass erasers also work by abrasion. These erasers physically remove the ink from the paper. There is some unavoidable damage with most types of paper and ink, where the paper absorbs some ink, but not all. The chemical ink eradicator contains a substance that reacts with some inks removing their pigmentation and hiding the writing.  Metal ink erasers  Metal ink erasers were generally used before chemical ink erasers were introduced, and when permanent writing was done in ink. The erasers were essentially small knives.  Chemical ink erasers  A modern-day ink eraser The chemical ink eraser was invented by the German manufacturer Pelikan in the 1930s, and was introduced as a novelty in Germany in 1972 under the name Tintentiger (ink tiger). Chemical ink erasers break down royal blue ink by disrupting the geometry of the dye molecules in ink so that light is no longer filtered. The molecules are disrupted by sulfite or hydroxide ions binding to the central carbon atoms of the dye. The ink is not destroyed by the erasing process, but is made invisible. It can be transformed back into a visible work with aldehydes. The eradicator works only with royal blue ink. It discolors black ink to a rust brown and changes the hue of non-standard blues, limiting its usefulness.

The collection was dedicated to Fitzgerald's agent Harold Ober. Reception In The New York Times, critic Edith Walton gave Fitzgerald's final collection a mixed reception. \\"The characteristic seal of his brilliance stamps the entire book, but it is a brilliance which splutters off too frequently into mere razzle-dazzle.\\" Citing the Basil Duke Lee stories as \\"small masterpieces,\\" Walton called Babylon Revisited \\"probably the most mature and substantial story in the book. A rueful, though incompleted, farewell to the Jazz Age, its setting is Paris and its tone one of anguish for past follies.\\" Walton continues, \\"It has become a dreadful commonplace to say that Mr. Fitzgerald's material is rarely worthy of his talents. Unfortunately, however, the platitude represents truth. Scott Fitzgerald's mastery of style ‚Äî swift, sure, polished, firm ‚Äî is so complete that even his most trivial efforts are dignified by his technical competence. All his writing has a glamorous gloss upon it; it is always entertaining; it is always beautifully executed.\\"Edith Walton, \\"Scott Fitzgerald's Tales,\\" The New York Times, March 31, 1935.

Life and career  Roche, the daughter of an engineer and a politically and artistically active mother was born in High Wycombe UK near London and raised in Germany. In 1983, when Roche was five years old, Roche's parents divorced, an event and experience that Roche later incorporated in her novels Feuchtgebiete (English: Wetlands) and ' (English: Wrecked). She grew up in the Lower Rhine region, in a family with liberal views. Her primary school was in Niederkr√ºchten. In 1989 she went to the secondary school, St. Wolfhelm Gymnasium, in the neighbouring town of Schwalmtal. When she was 14 years old she moved to M√∂nchengladbach, where she was educated at the Hugo Junkers Gymnasium in Rheydt. She left school after the 11th grade, at the age of 17. She obtained initial stage experience in drama groups during her time at school. Roche left home in 1993, still aged 17, and formed the garage rock group The Dubinskis with three female friends. The band never released an album, nor recorded any material, nor notably performed anywhere. There followed a period where she undertook anything that would shock and offend people ‚Äì self-mutilation to paint with blood, drug experiments, or shaving her head. After successfully auditioning for the German music channel Viva, she worked there for several years as a video jockey and presenter, as well on the sister channel Viva Zwei, where she presented her show Fast Forward. Roche has a daughter, Polly, born in 2002, whose father was the producer and writer of Roche's programme Fast Forward and Der Kindergeburtstag ist vorbei! (The child's birthday party is over). Since 2007, Roche has been married to Martin Ke√ü, co-founder of Brainpool, a media company in Cologne. In 2006, Roche played the female lead in the German film Eden, directed by Michael Hofman. The film was widely distributed in Europe. In an interview published in Der Spiegel in 2010, Charlotte Roche proposed to have sex with German president Christian Wulff in exchange for his veto on a new regulation extending the life of nuclear reactors,details see :de:Laufzeitverl√§ngerung deutscher Kernkraftwerke highlighting the controversial extension, and Wulff's role in passing it into law.\\"Roche offeriert Wulff Sex f√ºr Atom-Veto\\", Der Spiegel (14 November 2010) \\"Activist offers sex to German president for 'nuclear veto', The Indian Express (15 November 2010) Living in Germany, and fearing difficulties after the Brexit vote, Roche became a German citizen in 2017.

For supporters it is an erotic literary novel; for critics it is cleverly marketed shock fiction bordering on pornography with a previously exhibited habit of the author of offense for the sake of offense. Justin E. H. Smith wrote of the novel in a review in n+1: \\"If Roche has hit on something true and heretofore unsaid, it is the insight that to write about bodily fluids is not to describe something exceptional in the course of human life. It is, rather, to describe something that is always there and always felt to be there, through all those other things people do and experience at that level that used to be the subject of novels (falling in love, challenging others to duels, talking about the buying and selling of land, etc).\\"\\"Sea Slugs\\" by Justin E.

Previously, Graves was the head women's basketball coach at St. Mary's from 1997 to 2000, as well as Gonzaga University from 2000 to 2014. He was formerly an assistant coach for the Portland Pilots (1994‚Äì1997) and St. Mary Gaels, where he later got his first head coaching stint with the Gaels from 1997 to 2000. From the 2004‚Äì2005 season to the 2013‚Äì2014 season, he guided Gonzaga to ten consecutive West Coast Conference regular season titles. The 2007 team went 13‚Äì1 in conference play, and later won the WCC conference tournament. The school also received its first ever NCAA tournament appearance. He was named WCC co-coach of the year for his accomplishments. In 2005, 2010, and 2011, Gonzaga went undefeated in WCC regular season play. Rankings In 2005, Gonzaga was ranked 23rd in the nation, which was its highest ranking ever in the polls. At the end of the 2009‚Äì2010 season, the Zags was ranked 12th in the final poll, which was their highest ranking ever in the polls. At the end of the 2010‚Äì2011 season, the Zags was ranked 8th in the final poll, which is their highest ranking ever in the polls.

In his final year as coach of the Gaels, Graves led the Gaels to a NIT tournament and lost in the second round. Gonzaga Bulldogs (2000‚Äì2014) In April 2000, Graves was named head coach for Gonzaga. In his 14 years as coach for the Bulldogs, Graves turned the program from a last-place finish in the WCC to a national contender. For the past 10 years, Gonzaga have won or co-shared the regular season WCC title and the last six out of seven years, Gonzaga had made it into the NCAA tournament, with the WCC first ever at-large bid in the 2011‚Äì2012 basketball season. On April 7, 2014, Oregon named Graves as their head coach. On April 14, 2014, assistant coach Lisa Mispley Fortier succeeded Graves as head coach. Oregon Ducks (2014‚Äìpresent) On April 7, 2014, Oregon named Graves as their head coach, succeeding Paul Westhead, who was let go at the end of the 2013‚Äì14 season. The Ducks finished Graves's first season as head coach with a 13‚Äì17 record, 6‚Äì12 in the Pac-12, which was Graves' first losing season since his second year as head coach for the Gonzaga Bulldogs in the 2001‚Äì2002 season. In his second season, the team achieved a 24‚Äì11 record and made it to the WNIT semi-finals, where they lost to eventual champion South Dakota Coyotes 88‚Äì54. The next season, Graves led the Ducks to the Elite 8, where they lost to the Connecticut Huskies 90‚Äì52. The Ducks also reached the Elite 8 the next year, where they lost to the Notre Dame Fighting Irish 84‚Äì74 to finish 33‚Äì5, the most wins in program history. The next year, the Ducks reached to the Final Four for the first time in program history and their season ended with a 72‚Äì67 loss to Baylor in the national semifinals to finish the season with a 33‚Äì5 record. NCAA Tournament runs 2006‚Äì07 season and Gonzaga's first NCAA tournament appearance In the 2006‚Äì2007 season in West Coast Conference play, Gonzaga guided to a 13‚Äì1 record in conference play. The lone loss was against Pepperdine at McCarthey Athletic Center. In the middle of the season, future All-American Courtney Vandersloot signed with the Zags. In the WCC tournament, Gonzaga defeated Portland, San Francisco, and LMU to go to their first ever NCAA tournament. In the NCAA tournament, Gonzaga played against Middle Tennessee State and they suffered an 85‚Äì46 loss at Stanford, where they finished their season with a 24‚Äì10 record. 2008‚Äì09 season and Gonzaga's first NCAA tournament victory A couple of years later in the 2008‚Äì2009 season in WCC play, Gonzaga guided with a 12‚Äì2 record in conference play, with a loss to Portland at home and Pepperdine on the road. In the WCC tournament, Gonzaga defeated LMU and San Diego to go to their second NCAA tournament. In the 2009 NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Tournament, Graves guided Gonzaga to its first ever NCAA tournament victory over Xavier 74‚Äì59 at Alaska Airlines Arena at Hec Edmundson Pavilion in Seattle, WA. They would unfortunately lose to University of Pittsburgh 65‚Äì60 in the second round. 2009‚Äì10 season and Gonzaga's first ever Sweet 16 In the 2009‚Äì10 season in West Coast Conference play, forward Heather Bowman broke the WCC and Gonzaga women's basketball school record of 2,133 points during the 2009‚Äì2010 season. Gonzaga went undefeated in West Coast Conference with a perfect 14‚Äì0 record and unbeaten in West Coast Conference tournament in Las Vegas, NV. In the 2010 NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Tournament, Graves guided Gonzaga to an 82‚Äì76 first round victory over Hall of Fame coach Sylvia Hatchell's University of North Carolina Tar Heels women's basketball team and a 72‚Äì71 second-round victory over Gary Blair's Texas A&M; Aggies women's basketball team on Vivian Frieson's game winning shot with 15 seconds left in the game. This marks the first appearance in the Sweet 16 for the Zags. Gonzaga played against Xavier women's basketball team and lost 74‚Äì56 at ARCO Arena in Sacramento. 2010‚Äì11 and Gonzaga's magical run in the NCAA tournament The next year, Gonzaga went undefeated in West Coast Conference with a perfect 14‚Äì0 record for the second year in a row and unbeaten in the WCC tournament in Las Vegas, NV. In the 2011 NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Tournament, Graves guided Gonzaga to a 92‚Äì86 victory over Lisa Bluder's University of Iowa women's basketball team and an 89‚Äì75 victory over Nikki Caldwell's UCLA Bruins. Both games were held at the McCarthey Athletic Center. In the UCLA game, senior guard Courtney Vandersloot became the first Division I women's or men's basketball player to score 2,000 points and tally 1,000 assists in their career. The Zags won 76‚Äì69 over Jeff Walz's Louisville Cardinals to set up their first ever Elite 8 matchup against Tara Vanderveer's Stanford Cardinals. Gonzaga's season ended with an 83‚Äì60 loss and the loss ended Courtney Vandersloot's magical career. At the end of the season, the University of Washington was interested in hiring Graves for head coach, but Graves wasn't interested in the job and he decides to stay with Gonzaga. At the end of March 2011, Gonzaga signed an extension for Kelly Graves to coach the women's team until the 2020‚Äì2021 season. The post-Vandersloot era and 2012 NCAA tournament The next year, the Zags went through the conference with a 14‚Äì2 with their first WCC loss in nearly three years at home to St. Mary's and a 30-point loss to Jeff Judkins' BYU Cougars, which is their biggest loss in nearly 10 years. The Zags won against the St. Mary's Gaels and lost to the BYU Cougars. The Cougars were automatically selected to the NCAA Tournament, while the Zags had to wait and see if they are in the tournament or not. Since Gonzaga is one of 16 locations to host the first and second rounds of the NCAA tournament, Gonzaga was picked as a #11 seed in the Kingston region as an at- large bid, the first in WCC women's basketball history. This is Gonzaga's fourth consecutive NCAA tournament. The Zags defeated Hall of Fame coach C. Vivian Stringer's Rutgers Scarlet Knights 86‚Äì73 and a 65‚Äì54 victory over Katie Meier's Miami Hurricanes to make their third consecutive Sweet 16 appearance.

The Zags played against Iowa State in a sold-out crowd of 6,000; mostly Zags fans. The Zags lost to the Cyclones 72‚Äì60, which ended their 15-game winning streak, four straight NCAA Tournament victories at McCarthey Athletic Center, and four consecutive first round victories. The Zags ended the year with a 27‚Äì6 record. 2013‚Äì14 regular season/final season at Gonzaga and 2014 NCAA tournament The next year, Gonzaga went 10‚Äì2 in non-conference. The biggest highlight in non-conference was the Ohio State game at Value City Arena, where Shaniqua Nilles scored the final four points of the game for the Zags, including the game winning jumper as time expired, where the Zags escaped with a 59‚Äì58 win. The Zags went 16‚Äì2 in conference play with both losses on the road at St. Mary's by a final of 79‚Äì78 in overtime on December 28, which was the start of West Coast Conference and at BYU on February 15 by a final of 62‚Äì52.

The 24 wins is the most in a season since 2001‚Äì2002, where former Oregon coach Bev Smith led the Ducks to a 22-win season. 2016‚Äì17: The Ionescu era begins Graves led his youngest Ducks team in their women's basketball program history by starting three freshmen, most notably future Ducks icon Sabrina Ionescu. They finished non-conference with a 10‚Äì2 record, and finishing in sixth place for Pac-12 play with an 8‚Äì10 record.

The Ducks continued making history, playing against Brenda Frese's Maryland Terrapins by winning 77‚Äì63 to advance to their first ever Elite 8 appearance. This was the second time Graves led a double digit seed team to an Elite 8 appearance, where he led the Zags to one six years earlier. The Ducks ended their season at 23‚Äì14 with a 90‚Äì52 loss to the UConn Huskies. 2017-2018 season and 2018 NCAA tournament Graves led the Ducks to a record of 27‚Äì4 and their first Pac-12 title for women's basketball in 18 years with a 16‚Äì2 record in Pac-12 play.

The Ducks' season came to a close with an 84‚Äì74 loss to eventual national champion Notre Dame to finish the season with a 33‚Äì5 record. The 33 wins were the most in program history. 2018-2019 season and Kelly Graves'/Oregon Ducks women's basketball first ever appearance in the Final Four Graves led the Ducks to their second consecutive Pac-12 regular season title with a 16‚Äì2 Pac-12 record and 27‚Äì3 overall.

During the season, Ionescu became the first NCAA basketball player (male or female) to record 2,000 points, 1,000 assists, and 1,000 rebounds in a career. She had previously joined former Gonzaga great and current Chicago Sky player Courtney Vandersloot as the only NCAA players to reach said totals in points and assists. Ionescu reached the rebounding milestone on February 24, 2020 at #4 Stanford on what ESPN journalist Mechelle Voepel called \\"a highly emotional day\\" for her; hours before the game, Ionescu had been a featured speaker at the memorial service for mentor and close personal friend Kobe Bryant. Despite battling the flu, she extended her NCAA career record for triple-doubles to 26 while leading the Ducks to a 74‚Äì66 win that secured the top seed in the 2020 Pac-12 tournament.

Mashrabiya The Archbishop's Palace of Lima, the capital of Peru, is the residence of the Archbishop of Lima, and the administrative headquarters of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lima. It is located on the Plaza Mayor of Lima, in the Historic Centre of Lima. The palace is also headquarters to the offices of the cardinal of Peru who is Carlos Castillo Mattasoglio, who is also the archbishop of Lima.  History  Located on the land that Francisco Pizarro allocated to be the residence of the head priest of Lima after the foundation of the city in 1535, the current building was opened on December 8, 1924, and is considered a prime example of neo-colonial architectural that developed in Lima during the early twentieth century. Arqandina, El Portal Peruano de Arquitectura, El Palacio Arzobispal The old Archbishop's Palace was built on the place the Limean cabildo had occupied from 1535 to 1548, when that institution moved to its current location across the square. The building had six balconies of different styles and several entrances, displaying the Archdiocese coat of arms above the main gate. The architectural features of the courtyard were similar to those of several cloisters in the city. The old palace fa√ßade was demolished in the late 19th century along the Sagrario. The remaining structure was demolished prior to the construction of the present Archbishop's palace. The current building was designed by the Polish Peruvian architect Ricardo de Jaxa Malachowski, who used the Torre Tagle Palace as a reference point. Erected joined to the Cathedral of Lima, the location formerly belonged to the city's first police station and the city's first jail. After Pope Paul III designated this temple as the primary church headquarters of the city, the location became the current location of the Archdiocese. The facade is made up of baroque elements, completely made of reintegrated rock; ornate cedar balconies are located over the main doors, and the palace is finished by a granite sculpture of Saint Turibius of Mongrovejo the patron protector of the Archdiocese. The palace also consists of two flagpoles, one for the Peruvian flag and another for flag of the Vatican. The interior is completely ornated and is home to a sculpture of Santa Barbara the patron of Cuba. The ceiling is illuminated by famous French stained glass windows allowing the entry of light. The interior also contains marble staircases with wooden handrails which allow access to the second story.

Technical characteristics Alfonso XIII was built at the naval shipyard at Ferrol in Spain. Laid down in 1891, she was launched on 31 August 1891. In 1896, she entered service in a partially completed state as a training ship. She finally was fully completed and commissioned on 18 May 1900. The ships of the class were intended to have heavy armament and high speed on a small displacement. The lead ship, , although otherwise considered excellent, had proven top- heavy, so changes were made to Alfonso XIII to address this, including a smaller main gun. However, the changes, intended to improve upon Reina Regente, instead left Alfonso XIII lightly armed, slow, and still unstable in heavy seas. The Hontoria-built 7.9-inch (201 mm) guns were in single mounts on the broadside fore and aft, while the guns were in a central battery amidships. All five torpedo tubes were fixed and above the waterline, with two forward, one on each broadside, and one aft. Operational history Alfonso XIII was not yet fully complete when she entered service as a training ship in 1896. Still incomplete at the time of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, she was sent to Cadiz on 7 May 1898 to join the Spanish Navy's 2nd Squadron, under the command of Rear Admiral Manuel de Camara, then forming for a voyage to the Philippines. Due to her incomplete condition, Camara decided to leave her behind at Cadiz when his squadron departed on 16 June 1898 on its abortive voyage. Alfonso XIII spent the rest of the war in Spanish waters to defend Spain's coast from a potential attack by the United States Navy. After the war, Alfonso XIII finally was completed on 18 May 1900, and she was commissioned the same day. Her shortcomings in seaworthiness led her to having a short career, and she was soon stricken and scrapped. Notes References *Chesneau, Roger, and Eugene M. Kolesnik, Eds.

It is essentially tembang Sunda minus vocals, and also at interludes between songs at a typical Tembang Sunda performance. The higher pitched kacapi rincik, the lower pitched kacapi indung and the suling flute are the instruments used for kacapi suling. Kacapi suling has instrumental pieces performed in two different scales; the first four in laras pelog convey a light mood, the last four, in laras sorog are more slow and grave. The change to laras sorog usually takes place at midnight and lasts til sunrise. Many hotels in Indonesia, especially in Bali, and other parts of the world like in Shenzhen China play this Sundanese music genre in their lobbies.

Biography Early life Horrie Dargie was born in Whyalla, South Australia, the second son of Andrew Dargie and Adelaide (n√©e Sargent). His older brother Sir William Dargie was a noted Australian portrait artist. Music Dargie began his musical career as a diatonica harmonica player. He joined the Yarraville Mouth Organ Band, which practised in a shoe repairshop. Later he joined William Ketterer's \\"Victorian Mouth Organ Band\\". This band consisted of the most promising players in the state of Victoria. In the early 1930s he took up the chromatic harmonica and won a variety competition on a local radio station in 1937. In 1938 he moved to Sydney. Dargie studied clarinet and orchestration and started his own harmonica school in Sydney. With Williamson, Lois, and Metcalfe on chromatics, and Shea on chords and Bertram on bass he started a harmonica group, The Rockin' Reeds. Army years Horrie Dargie joined the Australian Army in 1941 and served in New Guinea and later in the occupational forces in Japan. He returned to Melbourne in 1947 and subsequently formed the famous Horrie Dargie Quintet. By 1952 the Quintet had risen in popularity by dint of hard work, and played their farewell concert at the Sydney Town Hall in 1952 before leaving for England. By chance, a recording was made of the performance on a wire recorder using just one microphone. The 10‚Ä≥ record of the farewell concert became Australia's first Gold Record, selling 75,000 copies. Upon arrival in England the Quintet performed at the Empire in London and an agent recognised the group's performance as unique because of their distinctive sound, humour, and individual style. They never copied or made renditions of numbers by overseas performers. Whilst on tour in London Horrie contracted polio ‚Äì apparently he collapsed on stage. The disease affected his diaphragm and legs, at the time he was told he would not be able to play a wind instrument again. He once described the illness as a 'bit of a problem' ‚Äì he was paralysed except for his right arm and he could swallow. With persistence he recovered and the Quintet later performed upon their return at the Tivoli in 1958. One of their more well known numbers was \\"Green Door\\" which become a hit in its own right. Television presenting In 1958 Dargie returned to Australia where he took up a position at Channel 9, where he was in charge of the talent division ‚Äì variety was very popular at the time and Dargie did four or five shows a week. He compered the BP Super Show and also was responsible for the Delo and Daly Show, He was the first Australian compere of the show The Price Is Right and managed The Go!! Show, a pop music show that regularly featured entertainers such as Johnny Young, Ian Turpie and Olivia Newton-John. Dargie also established Go!! Records in 1964 to promote artists who appeared on the show. In August 1967 Channel 0 Melbourne abruptly cancelled The Go!! Show and the loss of its major promotional outlet led to the demise of the Go!! record label. Musical arrangement Dargie is also remembered for his musical arrangements for the film Crocodile Dundee and the TV show The Leyland Brothers. Under the musical directorship of Sven Libaek, he also participated in the background music in the 1960s TV show Nature Walkabout (hosted by Vincent Serventy). Dargie also played the background music for the TV series Skippy the Bush Kangaroo.  Honours  In 1996 he was inducted into the Australian Record Industry Association (ARIA) Awards Hall of Fame in recognition for his effort in being the first Australian to achieve gold record status.

She did not have a far-reaching artistic reputation during her lifetime as she did not often exhibit her work in public. Her family found over 430 of her paintings after her death, and she has been the subject of three major retrospectives in the last 15 years. Her most significant work was created under the tutelage of famed American Regionalist painter Thomas Hart Benton. Early life Margot Peet was born in Kansas City, Missouri in 1903, and grew up in a prosperous merchant family that encouraged her interest in art. Her father, Williston Penfield Munger, was the owner of a local wholesale dry goods company. She attended The Barstow School, an exclusive school for girls in Kansas City. After graduation she attended Emma B. Hopkins French finishing school in New York City, where she received her first formal art training. Margot Munger returned to Kansas City in 1922, and in 1924, she married Herbert O. Peet, a Princeton graduate whose family owned Peet Brothers' Company, the largest soap company west of the Mississippi River. The couple had two daughters, Marguerite, born in 1925, and Jeannette in 1931. Painting career At 18 years old, the young Margot Munger was sent to the Miss Emma B. Hopkin's school, also known as the French House, a finishing school in New York City, despite having dreams of attending Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts. It was at this time that she also received her first formal artistic training. She took portraiture lessons with Clinton Peters of Baltimore, who held classes in a New York studio on Broadway. Peet began later intermittent studies at the Kansas City Art Institute in the 1920s. Her maternal aunt, Ruth Harris Bohan, was an accomplished oil painter who became an early role model. In the fall of 1935, when she was married with two small children at home, Peet enrolled in painting classes taught by the famous Regionalist painter, Thomas Hart Benton at the Art Institute. Under Benton's guidance, she produced her first multi-figural compositions, her first genre scenes, and her first paintings in egg tempera, a quick-drying medium using egg yolk as the binder. Benton painted in class alongside his students who produced \\"versions\\" of his subjects from slightly different angles. In 1939, Margot Peet painted a small version of Benton's iconic allegorical nude, Persephone, which is now one of the highlights of the American painting collection at the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City. Her painting Do Unto Others is a version of Benton's well-known work, Instruction, which he painted as part of an Art Institute class in 1940. Peet's work produced during this period is now viewed as her best. Benton selected a still life painting by Peet for an exhibition of his students' work that was held at the Associated American Artists Gallery in New York City. For the remainder of her life, she continued to paint garden still lifes, flower pieces and portraits. In 1993, some of Peet's paintings were featured in the exhibit, Under the Influence: The Students of Thomas Hart Benton, at The Albrecht-Kemper Museum of Art in St. Joseph, Missouri. Since her death in 1995 and the subsequent discovery of many unknown paintings, she has been the subject of two major retrospectives: With Grace & Wit: The Paintings of Margot Peet, 1903-1995 at the Johnson County Museum of History in 1999, and Margot Munger Peet, 1903-1995, The Barstow School Exhibit, in 2004. A full length art historical biography of Peet, Discovering Margot Peet: The Artist and the Art World of Kansas City was published in 2010. Philanthropy Peet was involved with multiple organizations in the Kansas City area, including the Westport Garden Club, an investment club, The Beautification Committee for Mission Hills, the Jewel Ball, and Planned Parenthood. Her affiliation with Planned Parenthood Started in New York in 1916. The Peets made the first substantial gift to the organization in 1956, and she joined the board that year, continuing to serve for nearly 20 years. Personal life Margot Peet enjoyed a rich family life as a wife and mother of two daughters, Marguerite and Jeannette. The Peets were an upper-class family with a full-time staff to assist in the running of the house and raising of the children. Art was ever present in her home and family life as she continued to create. She often could be found painting her own paper dolls for her daughters and friends to adorn with their own tabbed paper dresses. Her artistic talents extended to the kitchen, as she was described as a brilliant cook. Margot had a wide array of friends, including Ernest Hemingway, who made references to her in his work.

Career Colour Me Blue is a haunting collection of stories, published by Heinemann African Writers Series. It blends fantasy and reality, melding African history and tradition with the grittiness of everyday life. The stories capture the casual or determined oppression of men and women, the tenderness of human affection and the powerful rhythm of African myth. The politics of personal relationships are explored against a background of social injustice and material hardship. Sobott‚Äôs writing is characterised by a 'mixture of traditional story telling and modern day-to-day struggles‚Äô.J. Madingwane, \\"A Mixture of Old and New\\", Mayibuye, Vol. 7, No. 4, May 1996.

She has written on gender relations in Botswana during the Second World War, how the British government sought to increase the food production of the then Bechuanaland Protectorate for export purposes.

Wally ‚ÄòWait-a-While‚Äô Carr is an Australian Aboriginal ex-champion boxer who held twelve titles in six divisions. From featherweight to heavyweight, one of the last of the fifteen-rounders, he fought an astonishing 101 professional bouts in his 15-year boxing career. My Longest Round provides an Aboriginal man‚Äôs perspective on inner-city Sydney; the two-up games, the gangsters, and the way working-class neighbourhoods looked out for each other. From hunting goannas, Jimmy Sharman‚Äôs boxing tents, rugby league, professional boxing and the first Aboriginal Tent Embassy, to present-day struggles and lifestyles, this story offers a vital snapshot of Aboriginal and Australian history. Sobott worked very closely with Wally to render a vivid account of his tumultuous life. She is also editor of Young Days: Bankstown Aboriginal Elders Oral History Project, published in 2013.

Wanting to refine and perfect the package, Broadrick agreed and the EP saw full physical and digital distribution in 2003. Music and composition Musically, Messiah is more experimental than most Godflesh releases. Hip hop beats are more common than industrial ones, and uncommon instruments, like a sitar, are employed. Jon Wiederhorn of Bandcamp called the EP a \\"hybrid of knock-out punch and dreamy- eyed dissonance.\\" Broadrick's vocals are unusually melodic on some tracks, and heavy metal guitar is largely absent from the EP, with the focus instead placed on Green's distorted bass. Much like Godflesh's 1997 remix album Love and Hate in Dub and 1999 studio album Us and Them, Messiah incorporates drum and bass and dub aspects. About the EP's content, Broadrick said it \\"was mainly focused around the 'Messiah' track itself‚Äîthat is really the most important thing. Not to discount the other tracks at all, but that, we felt, was a really focused track‚Äîwe actually feel it‚Äôs one of the best Godflesh tracks out there, really.\\" Release The original fan club version of Messiah was released on 5 December 2000 through Broadrick's own label, Avalanche Recordings, and was limited to 1,000 copies with different artwork than the final EP. This was the first release from Avalanche. On 1 April 2003, Messiah was distributed as a CD by Relapse Records, and on 5 February 2008, the EP was released as three 2xLP vinyl editions (one with unique artwork, one with clear records, one with white records, and all limited to 1,000 copies each). Critical reception Due to the convoluted and often limited nature of Messiah's releases, few publications reviewed the EP. Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic said that Messiah features \\"four intensely pulverizing cuts\\" that \\"easily qualify as vintage Godflesh.\\" Chris Ayers of Exclaim! wrote, \\"ultimately, Messiah offers an unadulterated peek into Broadrick's mind before those albums were even ideas,\\" speaking of Love and Hate in Dub and Us and Them. Paul Sinclair of The Skinny described the EP's title track as a \\"cult classic\\". Track listing All songs written by Justin Broadrick and G.C. Green.

The islands lie in the James Ross Strait, east of Cape Felix, off the northeast coast of King William Island. They are about west of Kent Bay on the Boothia Peninsula, and about northwest of the Tennent Islands.  History  Captain (Sir) John Ross commanded the Victory during his second Arctic exploration (1829‚Äî1833), partly in order to regain credibility after charting a fictional landform, Croker Mountains, during his first Arctic expedition. He chose his nephew, Commander James Clark Ross, to be second in command. In 1830, while exploring within the Ross Strait, James Ross charted three islands. He named the group \\"Beaufort Islands\\" after Capt. Francis Beaufort, hydrographer of the Admiralty,Ross 1994:195Bossi 1984:571 and named the individual islands Adolphus Island, Frederick Island, and Augustus Island, these also being the names of three sons of the Duke of Clarence.Lundy 2008 John Ross did not see the \\"Beaufort Islands\\". Upon returning to England in 1833, the expedition's members learned that the Duke of Clarence had ascended to the throne in 1830, becoming King William IV. John Ross reviewed his expedition's chart book with Capt. Beaufort and with the new king. With the notation \\"changed by His Majesty's command\\" included, John Ross made changes to the chart: he added six islands and three capes, all with royal Clarence and Fitz-Clarence family names (including Munster Island, Falkland Island, Erskine Island, Fox Island, Errol Island, Cape Sophia, Cape Sidney, and Cape Mary), and renamed the island group \\"Clarence Islands\\". While as leader of the expedition, John Ross had authority to name newly charted landforms as he wished, he did not receive authority to add fictional landforms to navigation chart books. Lady Jane Franklin documented in her diary a meeting she had with Capt. Beaufort regarding the controversial chart book changes: > Captain B. asked me if Sir John's ire had abated against (James) Ross, and > he (Captain B.) seemed much tickled at this subject - he was not one he said > to take away a man's fair character, but there were some things that ought > to be held up to reprobation, and he was now going to tell me a good story. > He had the book brought him and he asked me how many islands I counted in > the Clarence group. I counted 9 - 3 I said were lilac, and the others white. > \\"Well\\", says he, \\"there are but 3, and when the chart was first shown to me, > there were only 3 marked down, but Ross having proposed to the King to call > them the Clarence Islands, 'Yes, yes,' said the King, 'call them the > Clarence islands', and then Ross thought it would be as well to make a few > more, so that the Clarences and Fitzclarences might have one apiece.\\" The > story was afterwards confirmed to Sir John by Capt. James Ross, who said > that his uncle had never seen the islands, had never been there and that it > was he, Capt. James, who laid down in the map the true original number.

She was, in fact, one of the first female judges in the British Empire next to Emily Murphy. Life Anna Chandy was born in Panavelil house in 1905 and raised in Trivandrum. She was a Syrian Christian. After obtaining a post-graduate degree in 1926, she then became the first woman in her state to get a law degree. She practised as a barrister from 1929 while simultaneously promoting the cause of women's rights, most notably in Shrimati, a magazine that she both founded and edited. Often described as a \\"first generation feminist\\", Chandy campaigned for election to the Shree Mulam Popular Assembly in 1931. She met with hostility from both her competition and newspapers but was elected for the period 1932-34. Chandy was appointed as a munsif in Travancore by Sir C.P. Ramaswami Iyer, the Dewan of Travancore, in 1937. This made her the first female judge in India and, in 1948, she was raised to the position of District Judge. She became the first female judge in an Indian high court when she was appointed to the Kerala High Court on 9 February 1959. She remained in that office until 5 April 1967.

It is conducted in locations throughout the Pacific theater to support the U.S. military charter of capacity building in partner nations. The operations contain elements of all four branches of the Department of Defense, including active duty, National Guard, and reserve members. The official statement from the USPACOM Public Affairs team states that U.S. military participates in these operations to enhance relations with partner nations, build medical and civil assistance capacity in those nations, and to prove a commitment to support the nation's efforts to assist their population in a time of need. The key difference between this mission and previous missions is that these missions are focused on capacity building in the host nation. The mission objective is to provide assistance to an area, and leave behind a capability for the host nation doctors to continue to provide the services.  Operations  Oceana Mission July 2007 In July 2007, the US Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) Command conducted a 10-day mission to the Oceana island nations of Kiribati, Nauru, and Vanuatu. This mission was unofficially dubbed Pacific Angel. Due to success in the mission, USPACOM directed PACAF to conduct a mission of continuing assistance to regional partner nations on a recurring basis. The focus of these missions would be on capacity building for the nation, subject matter expert exchanges, and engineering construction and repair of facilities. (More information concerning the Oceana mission of July 2007 will be uploaded shortly.) Pacific Angel 2008-01 (Thailand/Cambodia) Pacific Angel 2008-01 was designed to be a concurrent operation with the Royal Thai Air Force and the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces. In Thailand, an aeromedical evacuation subject matter expert exchange (SMEE) was planned with aeromedical evacuation personnel at U‚Äôtapao military airfield in Thailand. In Cambodia, the bulk of the HCA mission was to take place. Sites were placed outside of Kampong Chhnang and Kampong Cham, approximately 130 km north of the capital city of Phnom Penh In May 2008, the first actual Pacific Angel mission took place. Members of the US Air Force, US Army, and US Marine Corps conducted the twofold mission to Cambodia and Thailand. On May 22 around 7 PM, an Alaska Air National Guard C-130 carrying approximately 6000 pounds of medical supplies arrived at Phnom Penh airport in Cambodia. On May 25, the C-130 returned to Cambodia, this time landing at Kampong Chhnang military airfield, marking the first time a U.S. military aircraft had landed there. They unloaded another approximately 3000 pounds of supplies bound for sites in the Kampong Chhnang region and the Kampong Cham region. US military doctors, nurses, technicians, engineers, and veterinarians assisted members of the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces and members of the Children's Surgical Centre during the operation. On Sunday May 24, Medical operations at the three sites began In Kampong Cham, the mission operated out of the regional referral hospital in Kampong Cham city conducting civic action programs, such as an engineering CAP and a VETCAP. Engineering personnel began repair and refurbishment operations to the hospital on 26 May. US Military veterinarians conducted a SMEE with two local Cambodian veterinarians, and three veterinary students. By 25 May, they had serviced 258 animals, mostly livestock. At the Ou Reang Ov district hospital, approximately 20 km south of Kampong Cham, medical and dental programs were set up to see patients along with doctors from the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces and the Children's Surgical Centre. On the first day of operations, 634 patients had been seen, including: 354 primary care patients, 180 optometry patients with 13 surgeries, and 100 dental patients with 376 dental procedures completed. Also during this event, local medical students participated for training. The site in Kampong Chhnang, the Friendship clinic, was built by US personnel on a previous mission. It was designed as a multi-purpose room for the community, and was built by the US Marine Corps. Operations out of the Friendship clinic included medical and dental services with doctors from the Children's Surgical Centre and the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces. During the first day of operation, 507 patients were seen at the clinic including: 354 primary care patients, 32 Women's health patients, 59 optometry patients with 7 surgeries, 67 dental patients with 81 dental procedures. During this even, a patient was referred to the Children's surgical centre in Phnom Penh for a subdural head injury that could not be treated at the clinic. In Phnom Penh, US Air Force medical equipment technicians repaired equipment at the Children's Surgical Centre, the Chinda Clinic, and the Navy and Marine Research Unit (NAMRU). One USAF surgeon was assigned to the Children's Surgical Centre to assist in surgeries at the CSC main site and the Chinda Clinic. On the first day of operation the surgeon, Dr Kelleher, assisted in three surgeries. She stated that this experience has been incredible in that she has seen medical problems she would not have come across in the US. She stated that the US military doctors have much to learn from the medical personnel in Cambodia that do not have access to the technology, or facilities that are present in the United States. At all locations SMEE operations were performed dealing with public health, preventative medicine, sanitation, and infection control.

The school is divided into two campuses: Campus A and Campus B. The students are divided into the morning and the afternoon shifts, the latter of which is of shorter hours. Mr. Leonard Dias is the principal and in charge of discipline. Leonard Dias is the principal of both the morning and afternoon shifts. The two Campuses provides kindergarten, elementary, and secondary education, with Sindh Board and O-Levels. The school houses various student facilities, such as a physics, chemistry, biology, and computer studies laboratory, two fully established libraries, a formerly operational mini-zoo, a large playground, a cricket pitch, a basketball court, three canteens and stationery shops, an auditorium, and specific rooms for various arts like traditional art, singing, music etc. The school was established in 1941. It first started in the rooms of St. Patrick's Cathedral in Karachi, then it shifted to opposite of PNS Dilawar, on a former graveyard. Ali, G. and Ali, M. St. Patrick‚Äôs: A journey of 175 years. Archdiocese of Karachi, 2018. St Paul's English School Campus B is situated on the same grounds as Campus A. Both the Campuses, as of 2017, have their medium of spoken and written language as British English.  History and Establishment  St. Paul's English High School was first established as an elementary school in 1940 at Kala Pul, Karachi, by the Franciscan Missionaries. From there, it was then shifted to the Braganza Building in Saddar with only 4 grades. A fifth grade was initiated in 1942. Subsequently, the American Military Police took hold of Braganza Building, the school was then shifted to Younis Building on Frer√© Street. Classes were increased followed by a relocation to the library in St. Patrick's Cathedral. The school saw another relocation to Don Bosco's Orphanage, where it continued to remain partially established up till 1951. The hierarchy at the Catholic Church wanted to dedicate a proper parameter for the school, and with permission from the Pakistani Government, they transformed the Churchyard, a former British graveyard, into new grounds for the school's establishment. The entire responsibility of the school was left with Fr. Fulgence Kager, assisted by Fr. James deSouza. The school saw complete establishment and supposed evolution as the years went by. In 1952, the first batch of students appeared from the school for the annual Secondary School Certificate examinations. Fr. Fulgence Kager was shifted to the Archdiocese of Hyderabad, and Fr. Victor Kristen took his place. He remained in charge till 1956, when Fr. Lawry Pereira took his place. The title was later handed over to Fr. Armando Trindade, who augmented a second floor into the school building, along with a Kindergarten and Cambridge Section. After him, Fr. Varkey was appointed as head in 1969, where he was succeeded by Fr. Leslie Colaco in 1973. The responsibility was then handed to Fr. Joseph Paul in 1974, from where it was bestowed upon Fr. Max Rodrigues in 1984. The school celebrated its 50th anniversary, or Golden Jubilee, in 1991. Later the St Paul's Urdu High School and St. Thomas's School were denationalized by the Sindh Government and the responsibility was handed over to the Catholic Board. Fr. Max initiated an afternoon shift in the school premises to house the students of St. Thomas's, headed by Sr. Zita D'Cunha. Fr. Max's supervision saw an end when in the year 2000, Fr. Anthony Martis took his place. Fr. Martis headed the construction of a new wing on school premises, housing the Cambridge section and a well-established library, along with the construction of a second computer science laboratory, a choir room, and an arts and crafts room. The Reverend then continued to inaugurate yet another building opposite to the Cambridge Section, housing most of the upper elementary classes. Mr. Leonard Dias succeeded Fr. Anthony Martis. In 2013, the school established St. Paul's Model United Nations, an MUN conference headed by the staff and students. A Photographic Society was also established in 2015. The school celebrated its 75th anniversary, or Platinum Jubilee, in the year 2016. The English Literary Society is one of the school's oldest societies and it organizes elocution and declamation events for the students. The school's English Literary Society also conducted the first edition of the school's annual inter-school declamation in November 2017. The school also has an Urdu \\"Tehzeeb\\" Society that organizes declamations in the Urdu language Ms. Sylvia Pinto and Ms. Safia Hassan are the only Golden Jubilarians of the school to date.The School's Wing.

UltraBattery combines ultracapacitor technology with lead-acid battery technology in a single cell with a common electrolyte. Introduction Research conducted by independent laboratories, such as the United States's Sandia National Laboratories, the Advanced Lead-Acid Battery Consortium (ALABC), the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and commercial tests by East Penn Manufacturing, Furukawa Battery and Ecoult indicate that in comparison with conventional valve regulated lead acid (VRLA) batteries, UltraBattery technology has higher energy efficiencies, a longer lifetime and superior charge acceptance under partial state of charge (SoC) conditions. Combining the two technologies in one battery cell means that UltraBattery works very efficiently compared with conventional lead acid technologies largely due to the fact that it can be operated for long periods in a partial state of charge (pSoC), whereas conventional lead acid batteries are more typically designed for high SoC use (i.e. when the battery is close to fully charged). Operating in the partial SoC range extends the battery's life chiefly by reducing sulfation and by reducing time spent operating at very high and very low states of charge, where various side reactions tend to cause deterioration. A conventional VRLA battery tends to deteriorate quickly when operated in this partial SoC range. History UltraBattery was invented in Australia by CSIRO. The development of UltraBattery was funded by the Australian government. Japanese company Furukawa Battery Co., Ltd also contributed to the development of UltraBattery technology, and the Japanese government funded part of its development through the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO). In 2007, East Penn Manufacturing obtained a global head license to manufacture and commercialize UltraBattery technology for motive and automotive applications (in various territories) and for stationary energy storage applications (globally, outside Japan and Thailand, where Furukawa Battery is the head license holder). The United States Department of Energy has also funded UltraBattery for research into grid-scale stationary energy storage applications. In 2007, CSIRO formed a subsidiary company, Ecoult, to address this market. Ecoult also received support from the Australian Government to further the development of Ultrabattery. In May 2010, US battery manufacturer East Penn Manufacturing acquired Ecoult from CSIRO. In March 2013, the Australian Government announced further funding through the Australian Renewable Energy Agency's Emerging Renewables Program to further develop UltraBattery technology as cost- effective energy storage for residential and commercial renewable energy systems. Storage principle UltraBattery is a hybrid device that combines ultracapacitor technology with lead-acid battery technology in a single cell with a common electrolyte. Physically, UltraBattery has a single positive electrode and a twin negative electrode ‚Äì one part carbon, one part lead, in a common electrolyte. Together these make up the negative electrode of the UltraBattery unit, but specifically the carbon is the electrode of the capacitor and lead is the electrode of the lead-acid cell. The single positive electrode (lead oxide) is typical of all lead acid batteries and is common to the lead acid cell and the ultracapacitor. This technology (specifically the addition of the carbon electrode) gives UltraBattery different performance characteristics to conventional VRLA batteries. In particular UltraBattery technology suffers significantly less from the development of permanent (or hard) sulfation on the negative battery electrode ‚Äì a problem commonly exhibited in conventional lead acid batteries. Hard Sulfation During normal lead-acid battery operation, lead sulfate crystals grow on the negative electrode during discharging and dissolve again during charging. The formation of these crystals is called sulfation. Over time sulfation can become permanent, as some crystals grow and resist being dissolved. This is particularly the case when the battery is forced to perform at very high rates of discharge, which tends to promote lead sulfate crystal growth on the surface of the electrode. At moderate rates of discharge, the lead sulfate crystals grow throughout the cross section of the electrode plate (which has a sponge-like consistency) since the electrolyte (dilute sulfuric acid) is drawn diffused through the body of the electrode to allow the reaction can take place throughout the plate. But at very fast rates of discharge, the acid already inside the body of the plate is used up quickly and fresh acid cannot diffuse through the electrode in time to continue the reaction. Hence the reaction is favored toward the outer wall of the electrode, where crystals may form in a dense mat, rather than in dispersed clumps throughout the plate. This mat of crystals further impedes electrolyte transfer. The crystals then grow larger, and because the larger crystals have a large volume compared to their surface area it becomes difficult to remove them chemically during charging, particularly as the concentration of the sulfuric acid in the electrolyte is likely to be high (since only limited lead sulfate has been created on the surface of the plate) and lead sulfate is less soluble in concentrated sulfuric acid (above about 10% concentration by weight) than it is in dilute sulfuric acid. This condition is sometimes termed the ‚Äúhard‚Äù sulfation of the battery electrode [REF]. Hard sulfation increases the battery's impedance (since the lead sulfate crystals tend to insulate the electrode from the electrolyte) and decreases its power, capacity and efficiency due to increased undesirable side reactions, some of which occur inside the negative plate due to charging taking place with low availability of lead sulfate (inside the plate body). One undesirable effect is the production of hydrogen inside the plate, further reducing the efficiency of the reaction. ‚ÄúHard‚Äù sulfation is generally irreversible since the side reactions tend to dominate as more and more energy is pushed into the battery. To reduce the likelihood of hard sulfation, conventional VRLA batteries should therefore be discharged at specific rates, determined by various charging algorithms. [REF] Furthermore, they must be frequently refreshed and are most suited to operation toward the top end of the SoC (between 80% and 100% charged). [REF] While operating in this limited state of charge mitigates permanent sulfation on the negative electrode, battery operation exclusively at or near a full SoC is highly inefficient. [REF] The inefficiency is largely due to increases the incidence of side reactions (for instance electrolysis) which dissipate energy. The presence of the ultracapacitor integrated in the UltraBattery acts to limit the formation of hard sulfation inside the cell. [REF] This supports the battery's ability to operate for long periods in a partial SoC where the battery operates more efficiently. [REF] Conventional VRLAs are somewhat constrained to operate in the inefficient region toward the top of their charge capacity in order to protect them against damage by sulfation. Research continues into the reasons why the presence of the ultracapacitor reduces sulfation so successfully. Experimental results show that the presence of carbon within VRLA cells has some mitigating effect but the protective effects of the parallel-connected ultracapacitor within the UltraBattery are much more significant. Hund et al., for instance, found that typical VRLA battery failure modes (water loss, negative plate sulfation, and grid corrosion) are all minimized in the UltraBattery. Hund's results also showed that the UltraBattery, used in a high rate partial state of charge application, exhibits reduced gassing, mimimized negative plate hard sulfation, enhanced power performance and minimized operating temperature compared with conventional VRLA cells. Materials Used Lead forms part of the negative battery electrode. Carbon forms part of the negative ultracapacitor electrode. The electrolyte solution is made up of sulfuric acid and water. Lead Sulfate is a white crystal or powder. Normal lead acid battery operation sees small lead sulfate crystals growing on the negative electrode during discharging and dissolving back into the electrolyte during charging. The electrodes are constructed of a lead grid, with a lead-based active material compound ‚Äì lead oxide ‚Äì forming the remainder of the positive plate. Applications UltraBattery can be used for a range of energy storage applications, such as: * In electric vehicle (EVs) batteries * To store renewable energy and smooth electricity supply from intermittent energy sources * As part of efficient hybrid power systems with fossil-fuel electric generators * To provide ancillary services to electrical grids. UltraBattery is virtually 100 per cent recyclable and can be made at existing battery manufacturing facilities. UltraBattery in hybrid electric vehicles UltraBattery has several advantages over the existing nickel-metal hydride (Ni-MH) batteries currently used in hybrid electric vehicles. They are approximately 70 per cent less expensive, with comparable performance in terms of fuel consumption and faster charge and discharge rates than Ni-MH batteries. When used in hybrid electric vehicles, the UltraBattery's ultracapacitor acts as a buffer during high-rate discharging and charging, enabling it to provide and absorb charge rapidly during vehicle acceleration and braking. Testing of the Ultrabattery's performance in hybrid electric vehicles by Advanced Lead Acid Battery Consortium achieved more than 100,000 miles on a single battery pack without significant degradation. Laboratory results of UltraBattery prototypes show that their capacity, power, available energy, cold cranking and self-discharge meets, or exceeds, all performance targets set for minimum and maximum power-assist hybrid electric vehicles. UltraBattery in Microgrids UltraBattery can be used to smooth and shift (i.e. store for later use) renewable energy sources on microgrids to improve predictable power availability. UltraBattery can also be used in standalone microgrid systems, renewables power systems and hybrid microgrids. Standalone microgrid systems combine diesel or other fossil fuels with UltraBattery storage to improve the efficiency of fossil-fuel energy generation. Including energy storage in the system reduces the size of the gen-set (i.e. array of generators) because the batteries can handle peaks in the load. UltraBattery also reduces the fuel consumption of the gen-set, because the generators can run at their highest efficiency, regardless of variations in the load on the system. Renewables power systems combine UltraBattery technology with the renewable generation source to deliver local power. They can use either photovoltaic, wind or solar thermal energy, and commonly incorporate a back-up diesel generator. Hybrid microgrids integrate renewable generation sources with UltraBattery energy storage and fossil-fuel gen-sets to maximize the efficiency of base-load generation. This can greatly reduce the cost of energy compared with diesel-only powered microgrids. They also substantially decrease greenhouse gas emissions. An example of this type of microgrid is the King Island Renewable Energy Integration Project (KIREIP), being undertaken by Hydro Tasmania. This megawatt-scale renewable energy project aims to reduce both the cost of delivering power to the island and carbon pollution. Multi Purposing of Data Centers UltraBattery can be used to backup an uninterruptible power supply (UPS). In conventional UPS systems, the batteries sit, essentially unused, until a grid outage event occurs. Because the UltraBattery can provide frequency regulation and related grid services, it can generate revenue for the UPS asset owner at the same time as providing backup power. Community, Commercial and Applications For community applications, UltraBattery can be used as back-up in the event of grid outage (see Section 5.1) and for peak shaving. Also known as peak lopping, peak shaving is the ability to charge batteries during off-peak time, and use the power from the batteries during peak times to avoid higher charges for electricity. Another example of a community application is a 300 kW smart grid demonstration system set up by Furukawa Battery in the Maeda Area in Kitakyushu, Japan. This load-levelling application uses 336 UltraBattery cells (1000 Ah, 2 volts). The company has also installed two smart grid demonstrations of UltraBattery peak shifting technology at Kitakyushu Museum of Natural History & Human History. In Japan, the Shimizu Corporation has set up a microgrid (see Section 5.2) in a commercial building. The ‚Äòsmart building‚Äô system, which includes 163 UltraBattery cells (500 Ah, 2 volts), also monitors cell voltage, impedance and temperature. A second system, installed at Furukawa Battery's Iwaki Factory, incorporates 192 UltraBattery cells, a 100 kW power conditioning system and a battery management system. This load-levelling application was set up to control the factory's demand for power. For residential applications, local use of rooftop solar could be improved by using UltraBattery to both store power for use by the resident who owns the panels, and feed power or regulation services into the grid during high-value peaks. Grid Services UltraBattery can manage variability on electricity grids in five main ways: frequency regulation, renewable energy integration (smoothing and shifting), spinning reserve, ramp-rate control, and power quality and weak-grid support. =Frequency regulation= Electricity grids must manage the constant fluctuations in supply and demand of power to keep a constant frequency in order to maintain the physical operation of the grid. UltraBattery can absorb and deliver power to the grid to help manage the balance between supply and demand, and to maintain consistent voltage. Ecoult implemented a grid-scale energy storage system which provides 3 MW of regulation services on the grid of Pennsylvania-Jersey-Maryland (PJM) Interconnection in the United States. Four strings of UltraBattery cells are connected to the grid in Lyon Station, Pennsylvania. The project provides continuous frequency regulation services bidding into the open market on PJM. =Smoothing & Shifting= UltraBattery technology can be used to integrate renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, into the electricity grid, by managing the fluctuations in renewable output. It does this by ‚Äòsmoothing‚Äô and ‚Äòshifting‚Äô energy. Smoothing turns the inherent variability of power from photovoltaic panels or wind turbines into a smooth, predictable signal. The system monitors the output of the intermittent renewable source, and when the solar (or wind) signal varies, UltraBattery responds immediately to either release energy or absorb excess energy. Managing the variability of the renewable signal in this way makes renewable energy more reliable. Shifting energy refers to UltraBattery's ability to store the excess energy produced by renewable resources in off-peak times, and to then release it when needed during periods of peak demand. This allows electricity utilities to improve their overall system performance at peak times. PNM, the leading electric utility company in New Mexico, United States, has integrated an UltraBattery energy storage system with a solar energy-generating farm to demonstrate smoothing and shifting of solar power for use as a dispatchable renewable resource. The PNM Prosperity project features one of the United States‚Äô largest combinations of photovoltaic energy and solar panel battery storage. =Ramp-rate control for distributed storage= Many small-scale deployments of rooftop photovoltaic panels tend to multiply the effect of the intermittency of solar generation ‚Äì creating a problem for grid operators. [REF] UltraBattery energy storage has been used to reduce renewable intermittency by ramping the power on the electricity grid in a controlled manner, making renewable-generated power more predictable. =Power quality and weak-grid support= UltraBattery can also be used for demand management, which addresses the problems of grid supply and demand, but not necessarily those related to renewable intermittency. At the periphery of large grids, or on old grid infrastructure ‚Äì such as single-wire earth return networks ‚Äì the effect of a demand spike or variance in supply can be amplified because of its scale relative to other local activity. UltraBattery can reduce these effects and ensure power quality from the grid for local users. Properties UltraBattery has five main characteristics that form points of difference between this technology and conventional VRLA battery technology: higher capacity turnover, lower lifetime cost per kilowatt hour, higher DC‚ÄìDC efficiency, fewer refresh charges required and higher rate of charge acceptance. right Capacity turnover A battery's capacity turnover is the amount of possible energy throughput in relation to the capacity of the battery. It is a normalized measure of how many times the theoretical capacity of a battery can be used over its lifetime. A higher capacity turnover indicates the battery provides more energy over its lifetime When UltraBattery and standard VRLA (used in a partial SoC regime) are compared in experimental conditions, UltraBattery has been shown to achieve about 13 times the capacity turnover of a standard absorbed glass matt VRLA battery. Lifetime cost per kilowatt hour The lifetime of a battery depends on how it is used, and how many cycles of charging and discharging it is put through. In a situation where batteries are put through four 40% cycles per day and where throughput is the life-limiting factor, UltraBattery will last about three to four times longer than a conventional VRLA battery. CSIRO, claims ‚ÄúThe UltraBattery is about 70 per cent cheaper to make than batteries with comparable performance and can be made using existing manufacturing facilities‚Äù. DC‚ÄìDC efficiency A battery's DC‚ÄìDC efficiency describes the amount of energy available to be discharged to the load connected to a battery as a proportion of the amount of energy put into the battery during charging. During charging and discharging, some of the battery's stored energy is lost as heat, and some is lost in side reactions. The lower the energy losses of a battery, the more efficient the battery is. UltraBattery's developers claim it can achieve a DC‚ÄìDC efficiency of 93‚Äì95% (rate dependent) performing variability management applications in a partial SoC regime, depending on discharge rate, and 86‚Äì95% (rate dependent), when performing energy shifting applications.By comparison, standard VRLA batteries applied to energy shifting (using the typical top of charge regime) achieve much lower efficiencies ‚Äì for instance in states of charge from 79% to 84% charged, tests show efficiencies around 55%. The high DC‚ÄìDC efficiency of UltraBattery is achievable because (like conventional VRLA batteries) it operates very efficiently below 80% SoC. Experiments indicate that for VRLA batteries ‚Äúfrom zero SOC to 84% SOC the average overall battery charging efficiency is 91%‚Äù. While conventional VRLA batteries cannot tolerate working in this range for any significant length of time without frequent refreshing, UltraBattery can tolerate working at much lower states of charge without significant degradation. Hence it can achieve much greater efficiencies since it can operate for long periods in the most efficient zone for lead acid batteries. Refresh cycles During operation, conventional VRLA batteries must be refreshed (overcharged) to dissolve the sulfate crystals that have accumulated on the negative electrode and replenish the capacity of the battery. Refreshing the battery also helps return the battery cells in the string (where multiple batteries are used together) to a consistent operating voltage. However the overcharging process is complicated by the fact that not only is the battery out of service during refresh cycles, but the high currents required to complete the overcharge process (within a reasonable timeframe) are also the cause of various parasitic losses. These include thermal losses and losses due to various side reactions (chiefly hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution and grid corrosion). UltraBattery can operate without a refresh charge for extended periods. For stationary cycling applications such as renewable energy or grid support, this may be between one and four months depending on workload; standard VRLA batteries in the same applications need refreshing every one to two weeks if performing daily cycles - and performance deteriorates rapidly even with weekly refresh cycles. In automotive applications in a hybrid electric vehicle, UltraBatteries can be operated more or less continuously in a partial SoC regime without being refreshed. Furukawa reports: ‚ÄúIn the field driving test of the Honda Insight hybrid electric vehicle with an UltraBattery pack installed, a target drive of 100,000 miles (approx. 160,000 km) was achieved without the recovering charging. Charge acceptance Because UltraBattery operates effectively in the partial SoC range, it can accept charge more efficiently than conventional VRLA batteries, which typically operate at high states of charge. Sandia National Laboratory tests show VRLA batteries typically achieve less than 50% efficiency at greater than 90% charged, about 55% efficiency between 79% and 84% charged, and over 90% efficiency if charged at between zero and 84% of the full capacity. In comparison with conventional VRLA batteries, UltraBattery can be charged efficiently and at high charging/discharging rates. Hund et al.‚Äôs test results showed that the Ultrabattery was able to cycle at the 4C1 rate for around 15,000 cycles. The VRLA battery using this test procedure could only cycle at the 1C1 rate. A 1C rate indicates that the battery's entire capacity would be used (or replaced if charging) in one hour at this rate. A 4C rate is four times faster ‚Äì i.e. the battery would be fully discharged (or charged) in 15 minutes at the 4C rate. The exact chemical process by which carbon so significantly delays sulfation is not fully understood. However the presence of UltraBattery's parallel ultracapacitor apparently protects the negative terminal from the large surface preponderance of lead sulfate crystals that affects VRLA batteries operated at high rates of discharge or for long periods in pSoC operation, increasing the rechargeability of the cell (see also Hard Sulfation). Reduced sulfation also significantly enhances charge acceptance by reducing hydrogen gas production at the electrode . This is not unexpected since excessive hydrogen gas production (which robs significant energy from the charging process) is caused when electrons pushed into the negative plate during charging (which would usually react with the lead sulfate crystals inside the plate) are unable to easily react with large crystals of lead sulfate on the surface of the plate, so instead tend to reduce the electrolyte's abundant hydrogen ions to hydrogen gas. Standards & Safety UltraBattery is manufactured by East Penn Manufacturing in the United States, to the global requirements of ISO 9001:2008, ISO/TS 16949:2009 and ISO 14001:2004 certification standards. UltraBattery's electrolyte solution contains H2SO4 in water, and its lead electrodes are inert. As the electrolyte is largely water, UltraBattery is fire retarding. UltraBatteries have the same transport and hazard restrictions as conventional VRLA batteries Recycling Every part of each UltraBattery ‚Äì lead, plastic, steel and acid ‚Äì is virtually 100% recyclable for later reuse. Large-scale recycling facilities for these batteries are already available and 96% of lead acid batteries used in the US are recycled. Battery manufacturers recover and separate the lead, plastics and acid from VRLA batteries. The lead is smelted and refined for reuse. Plastic parts are cleaned, ground, extruded and moulded into new plastic parts. The acid is reclaimed, cleaned and used in new batteries. Research Tests have been conducted by independent laboratories, as well as by East Penn Manufacturing, Furukawa and Ecoult, to compare the performance of UltraBattery with conventional VRLA batteries. Hybrid electric vehicle tests Micro hybrid electric vehicles batteries were tested at a 70% SoC in a pulse charge-discharge pattern. UltraBattery had about 1.8 times more capacity turnover, and therefore cycle life, than a conventional VRLA battery. The Advanced Lead Acid Battery Consortium (ALABC) tested the durability of UltraBattery in the high-rate, partial state-of- charge operation of a Honda Civic hybrid electric vehicle. The test car had comparable miles per gallon performance as the same model powered by Ni-MH batteries. Under micro, mild and full hybrid electric vehicle duties, the cycling performance of the UltraBattery was at least four times longer than conventional state-of-the-art VRLA batteries and was comparable or even better than that of Ni-MH cells. UltraBattery also demonstrated good acceptance of the charge from regenerative braking, and so did not require equalization charges during the field trial. Stationary energy applications =Efficiency test= Wh (watt-hours) efficiency tests of UltraBattery in a stationary application for an electricity smart grid showed that over 30 cycles of charge-discharge at rates of 0.1 C10A, Wh efficiencies ranged from 91% to 94.5%, depending on the battery's state of charge. [REF] This is compared with a Sandia National Laboratories study into lead-acid battery efficiency which found that traditional lead-acid batteries operating between 79% and 84% state-of-charge (the ‚Äútop‚Äù charge mode to which traditional lead- acid batteries are generally restricted to prolong their life) achieve only 55% incremental charging efficiency. =Cycle life and recovery test= Batteries were subjected to 3-hour charge and discharge tests at a 60% state of charge, with a 20-hour recovery charge conducted every 90 cycles. Capacity tests showed that after 270 cycles, the UltraBattery capacity ratio was equal to or greater than 103%, compared to 93% for a conventional lead storage battery. The tests showed that the UltraBattery had a longer cycle life and better recovery charge characteristics than the conventional battery when operating in a partial state of charge. =Utility services and wind farm energy smoothing= High-rate, partial state-of-charge cycle tests were performed to measure the ability of UltraBattery for use in utility ancillary service applications for energy storage and wind farm energy smoothing. Using a high-rate, partial state-of-charge cycling profile at the 1C1 to 4C1 rate, the UltraBattery was capable of more than 15,000 cycles with less than 20% capacity loss, and could cycle at the 4C1 rate. An absorbed glass matt (AGM) VRLA battery tested under the same conditions could only cycle at the 1C1 rate, required a recovery charge after about 100 cycles, and after 1100 cycles lost more than 20% of its capacity. UltraBattery was also able to cycle for more than ten times the number of cycles between recovery charges than the AGM VRLA battery (1000 vs.100). A wind farm field trial in Hampton, New South Wales (Australia), is testing a system designed to demonstrate the use of energy storage to address the short-term intermittency of wind generation. The trial compared the performance of the UltraBattery and three other lead-acid battery types for renewable energy smoothing applications. Measurements of the variations in cell voltage in each string of 60 cells connected in series showed that the UltraBattery had far less variation over a 10-month period (a 32% increase in standard deviation of voltage range variation, compared to 140%‚Äì251% for the other three battery types). =Utility cycling and photovoltaic hybrid energy applications= Tests by Sandia National Laboratories show that UltraBattery performs for much longer than conventional VRLA batteries in utility cycling. The cycling profile in these tests was intended to mimic frequency regulation duty with approximately 4 cycles per hour with a peak power intended to give a SoC range expected to be typical. The results showed that a conventional VRLA battery (cycling in a partial state of charge (PSoC) and 10% depth of discharge) dropped to 60% of its initial capacity after about 3000 cycles. In the same test an UltraBattery manufactured by East Penn ran for more than 22,000 cycles, maintaining essentially 100% of its initial capacity without having been supplied a recovery charge. Tests also showed that UltraBattery performs for much longer than conventional VRLA batteries in energy applications, as shown in a simulated photovoltaic hybrid cycle-life test by Sandia National Laboratories. The testing concluded that even at 40-day deficit charges (cycles where more is taken from the battery each day than is put back in). UltraBatteries have performance far surpassing traditional VRLA batteries even when the traditional VRLA batteries are operating on only 7 day deficit charge regimes. In a deficit charge regime there is no recovery by taper charge, also known as refreshing/equalization of the batteries so sulfation is a typical failure mode for conventional VRLAs in this operating regime. After 100 days of cycling with 60% depth of discharge, a conventional VRLA battery receiving a refresh cycle every 30 days had dropped to 70% of its initial capacity. Two UltraBattery units (one made by Furukawa, one by East Penn) each experiencing 40-day deficit charges were still performing significantly better than the traditional VRLA battery which was receiving more frequent refreshes (it experienced only a maximum 7-day deficit charge). After 430 days of cycling, the East Penn UltraBattery and Furukawa UltraBattery still had not failed. The East Penn Battery was maintaining 85% of its initial capacity and the Furukawa battery was at very close to 100% of its initial capacity.

A number of the larger species are fished commercially and recreationally, and are considered good table fish. Classification Fishbase lists 12 species in 5 genera under the subfamily Scorpidinae, the genera are set out below * Bathystethus Gill, 1893 * Labracoglossa Peters, 1866 * Medialuna Jordan & Fesler, 1893 * Neoscorpis J.L.B.

It was Krum's second novel, and was published in July 2005 in the United States by Viking Press and in the United Kingdom by Century, an imprint of Random House. As of 2005, publication was also planned for Italy (Arnoldo Mondadori Editore), the Netherlands (Unieboek), Russia (Amphora), and Spain (Urano). Plot summary The plot of the novel revolves around the title character Jane Spring, an attractive and intelligent 31-year-old Manhattan assistant district attorney and West Point general's daughter who grew up without a female role model and struggles to understand why she fails to 'keep' men in a relationship. Spring is described as \\"militaristic\\", \\"no-nonsense\\", \\"aggressive\\", \\"abrasive\\", \\"caustic\\" and \\"tomboyish\\", and a \\"domineering hellion ... who makes old ladies cry on the stand and men run for the hills\\". A review in The Age characterizes Spring as the antithesis of Helen Fielding's fictional character Bridget Jones. A military brat, she prioritizes discipline and motivation and disdains 'civilians' who lack these qualities. A series of events, including overhearing her colleagues' thoughts about her and seeing a Doris Day marathon, ultimately give way to an epiphany and prompt her to reevaluate her approach and undergo a transformation to \\"get in touch with her feminine side\\". Reception Kirkus Reviews described The Thing About Jane Spring as \\"[s]mart and bracingly funny\\" and a \\"winning fable about the seemingly lost art of being a lady\\", and an Orlando Sentinel review commended its \\"nostalgic charm\\". A reviewer for the Connecticut Post considered the book \\"a smart satire of feminine behavior in two entirely different eras\\". Publishers Weekly called it \\"sprightly\\" and \\"high-concept\\", playwright and novelist Joanna Murray-Smith characterized it as \\"easy and entertaining\\" reading, and reviews in the Deseret Morning News and Omaha World-Herald labeled it \\"light-hearted\\". According to Booklist, the novel is a \\"charming modern fairy tale with all the essential chick-lit elements: witty banter, quirky secondary characters, dueling love interests, and personal makeovers\\". A Library Journal review, however, asserted that The Thing About Jane Spring is characterized by \\"one- dimensional characters, lack of setting, and [a] thin story line\\". A reviewer for The Sun-Herald opined: \\"This funny, frothy Cinderella story is fabulously silly.\\" A review in The Sunday Star-Times agreed, noting: \\"It's just plain silly. Which, ultimately, redeems it.\\" However, a reviewer for The Cairns Post found the novel's premise to be \\"dated and damn irritating\\" and recommended it only for those who consider Doris Day to be the \\"epitome of womanhood\\". A review in The Plain Dealer offered a more mixed assessment, stating that \\"[w]hile Krum‚Äôs message ... hits home, it also disappoints. ... The new Jane might be a happier person, but she‚Äôs not nearly as misanthropic and interesting as her nasty old self.\\" Film adaptation CFP Productions, a production company established by Christine Peters, known for How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, acquired adaptation rights to The Thing About Jane Spring for Paramount Pictures in 2005. Paramount optioned the novel for six figures. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Paramount enlisted director, producer, and screenwriter Shainee Gabel, known for A Love Song for Bobby Long, in 2006 to adapt the novel into a film.

Sinise is known for playing the role of Lt. Dan Taylor in Forrest Gump. The Disney family is the only family to have more than one member serve as Grand Marshal: Walt Disney was the 1966 Grand Marshal, then his nephew Roy E. Disney held the post in 2000. Additionally, Mickey Mouse was the grand marshal for the 2005 parade. A number of years have featured multiple grand marshals, with the most in one parade being 1952, when seven Medal of Honor recipients were the grand marshals. Dr. Francis F. Rowland has been the grand marshal more than any other person - a total of seven times, in 1890, 1892, 1894, 1904, 1905, 1910 (this year sharing this duty with Prof. Charles F. Holder), and 1916. Former child actress Shirley Temple Black holds the runner-up position, having been grand marshal three times in 1939, 1989 and 1999, the latter year where she shared this honor with astronaut Buzz Aldrin, baseball player Jackie Robinson (who was also the first ever posthumous grand marshal) and film producer David L. Wolper. On May 9, 2014, Louis Zamperini was selected as the Grand Marshal for the 2015 Tournament of Roses Parade, though he would die of pneumonia two months later, and six months before the parade was set to begin. Rather than select a new Grand Marshal, the Tournament announced that it was \\"committed to honoring him as the Grand Marshal of the 2015 Rose Parade,\\" making him the first posthumous grand marshal since Jackie Robinson in 1999.The Tournament ff Roses Expresses Our Heartfelt Sympathy to The Family ff Louis Zamperini, Pasadena Tournament of Roses Association, July 3, 2014 On November 3, 2016, the 2017 Grand Marshals were revealed to be three Olympic athletes: Greg Louganis, Janet Evans and Allyson Felix. The Olympians were deliberately chosen to reflect on Los Angeles' bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics. This was the first year with multiple Grand Marshals since 2003, when Bill Cosby, Art Linkletter and Fred Rogers all shared this duty. 1890s * 1890 - Dr. Francis F.

He served as the Prime Minister of Czechoslovakia from 1944 to 1946, first in the London-based exiled government and later in liberated Czechoslovakia. His name is often associated with the merger of his Social Democratic Party with the Czechoslovak Communist Party after the communist coup in 1948. He was the uncle of Paul Fierlinger, the famous animator for numerous PBS cartoons. Early career Zdenƒõk Fierlinger came from an upper-class family. He graduated from business school in 1910 and then worked as a sales representative in Russia. During World War I he joined the Czechoslovak Legion. For his bravery on battlefield Fierlinger was four times awarded by Order of St. George. Among other fights, he participated in the Battle of Zborov. After the war, Fierlinger returned to Czechoslovakia and joined the diplomatic service. He was successively ambassador to the Netherlands, Romania, the United States, Switzerland and Austria. During this period he was a close friend and collaborator of Edvard Bene≈°. In 1924 he joined the Czech Social Democratic Party. In the Soviet Union Between 1937 and 1945 Fierlinger held the post of envoy (and later ambassador) to the USSR. During his period in Moscow, Fierlinger was very close to the leadership of the Czechoslovak Communist Party led by Klement Gottwald. This is evident, for example, when in 1943 when the Communists in conjunction with Fierlinger facilitated the signing of the Soviet-Czech peace treaty in Moscow on 12 December 1943 by Joseph Stalin and Edvard Bene≈°. The end of war and arrival of the communists Just before the end of World War II in April 1945 Fierlinger became prime minister of the Czechoslovak government-in-exile, retaining that post after the country was liberated later in 1945. He remained prime minister until the 1946 elections. He became a leading figure in the \\"left-wing\\" social democracy movement which sought the closest possible ties with the Czechoslovak Communist Party. Between 1946 and 1948 Fierlinger was chairman of the Czech Social Democratic Party. After the communist coup in February 1948, Fierlinger acted as the chief proponent of the \\"unification\\" of the Social Democrats and the Communists. Through the unification of the party, he became a member of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party in 1948. According to American journalist John Gunther, Fierlinger was subsequently nicknamed \\"Dr. Quislinger.\\" Zdenƒõk Fierlinger subsequently served as Deputy Prime Minister from 1948 to 1953, Minister of the State Office for religious affairs from 1951 to 1953, Chairman of the National Assembly from 15 October 1953 to 23 June 1964 and Minister in charge of the State. He remained a member of the Central Committee until 1966. In 1968, among other things, one of his last public acts was to lead a delegation in protest outside the Soviet Embassy.

Wilson (born 1793 - died 1872) was a U.S. Army officer who served in five wars and countless conflicts. Background and career He was born in 1793 in Philadelphia and was commissioned an ensign in the 28th U.S. Infantry in 1813. He was promoted to second lieutenant in 1814. In 1815, he was recommissioned and was sent with General Andrew Jackson to Florida to serve during the First Seminole War. While in service there, he was promoted to captain and made the rear adjutant of Jackson's Army. In Pensacola, he met his future wife, Mary Henrietta Innerarity, daughter of John Innerarity, scion of the Forbes & Co. Indian trading firm. He served in various posts in Baton Rouge, Minnesota, and Michigan and later served in the Second Seminole War, at one time as military governor of the western Florida military district, after being promoted to brevet major and then major. He was detached from duty in April 1837 to mediate a conflict at Mobile Point, Alabama, over the proper delivery of contracted beef for the Creek Indians who were being rounded up and transported to their new lands in the West. In 1838, he headed up the final preparations for the migration of the Cherokee Indians from western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee, the Trail of Tears. He served in Arkansas as a major and later lieutenant colonel of the First Infantry Regiment and was called by General Zachary Taylor to go to the Texas-Mexican border in June 1846 and commanded the First Brigade, made up of four companies of the First Infantry. He fought in the Battle of Monterey and was breveted a colonel for his bravery. Wilson was later detached from Taylor's forces to go with General Winfield Scott to the Siege of Vera Cruz. Wilson was appointed to the post of military governor of that city in March 1847 and served in that capacity, with a few leaves of absences for sickness, until the U.S. Army pulled out of Mexico in July 1848. He was then attached to duty on the Texas border fighting Comanche Indians.Russell D. James, \\"Henry Wilson,\\" in Spencer C. Tucker (ed.), The Encyclopedia of North American Indian Wars, 1607-1890 (Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2011), p. 848. Colonel In June 1851, Wilson was promoted to colonel of the Seventh Infantry, replacing Colonel James Arbuckle who had died of cholera earlier that year.Heitman, Historical Register and Dictionary of the United States Army (Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1903), p. 1046. After completing his duties in Texas, he joined his new regiment in November of that year, officially assuming command of the regiment and the Seventh Military District, headquartered at Fort Smith, Arkansas.Regimental Returns, Seventh Infantry, National Archives. His regiment helped to maintain peace throughout Indian Territory during the 1850s. In January 1858, the Seventh Infantry was among the troops assigned to the Utah Expedition to put down a possible Mormon rebellion. Colonel Wilson however was on leave at the time the orders arrived and was in San Antonio temporarily commanding the Department of Texas through the summer of 1858. Struggling with health issues, he returned home to New Orleans on sick leave where he remained for the next two years. Consequently, contrary to some published accounts, Colonel Wilson was never in Utah.Regimental Returns, Seventh Infantry, National Archives. Civil War In February 1861, he resigned his commission in the U.S. Army after 48 years of service. He had not rejoined his regiment in nearly three years. He is rumored to have offered his services to fight for the Confederate States, but no evidence exists to suggest he was accepted or had any military role. He later served on the Board of Directors of the Bank of New Orleans. Death He died February 21, 1872 in New Orleans and was buried in St. Joseph Cemetery in Lafayette Parish, Louisiana.

Along with God Bless and Slank dubbed as one of the greatest legends or icons in the history of Indonesian popular music. The band was formed in 1986. There have been a number of changes to the lineup and finally they were disbanded in 2011. Their last members lineup was: Ahmad Dhani (keyboard), Andra (guitar), Agung Yudha (drums), Yuke (bass guitar), and Once (vocals). This group has achieved success throughout the 1990s with Ari Lasso's vocals and the 2000s with Once's vocals. The album they released almost always received good reception in the market, even their album released in 2000, Bintang Lima, is #9 list of Indonesian all time best selling albums with sales of nearly 2 million copies. In 2005, Hai magazine named Dewa 19 as the richest band in Indonesia with revenues reaching more than 14 billion a year. In the midst of the success he achieved, this group had stumbled several times over legal issues, including issues of copyright infringement and feud with Islamic organizations. Throughout his career, Dewa 19 has received many awards, both BASF Awards and AMI Awards. They have also won the LibForAll Award in the United States for their contributions to peace efforts and religious tolerance. In 2008, Dewa 19 entered the list of \\"The Immortals: The 25 Greatest Indonesian Artists of All Time\\" by Rolling Stone magazine. History Beginnings (1986‚Äì1991) Dewa was formed in 1986 by four students from SMAN 2 Surabaya. The name Dewa is an acronym of the founding members' names: D from Dhani (keyboard, vocals), E from Erwin Prasetya (bass guitar), W from Wawan Juniarso (drums) and A from Andra (guitar). Dewa is also an Indonesian word meaning 'god', or 'deity'. The band was initially based at Wawan's dorm at Airlangga University. Wanting to take a different direction, Wawan left the band in 1988 and formed Outsider with Raihan. The name Dewa was changed to Down Beat which became reasonably well- known in East Java during that time. When rock band Slank became famous, Wawan was asked to rejoin Dewa to rejuvenate the band and Ari Lasso was invited too. When the band's members were 19 years old, Down Beat changed its name to Dewa 19. Due to the lack of a studio that met their requirements in Surabaya, the band moved to Jakarta, where after a number of rejections by record companies, a Dewa 19 master was finally recorded by Team Records. 1992-1994: First album and early success The first album Dewa 19 was released in 1992. Exceeding expectations, the album received awards from BASF in the categories of Best Newcomer and Most Popular Album of 1993. In this album their signature songs are \\"Kangen\\" and \\"Kita Tidak Sedang Bercinta Lagi\\". During the making of the second album Format Masa Depan which was released in 1994, Wawan left the band again due to incompatibility between the members. 1995‚Äì1999: Terbaik Terbaik, Pandawa Lima, mainstream success, and conflict After their 1995 album Terbaik-Terbaik was completed, Wong Aksan joined the band as drummer. This album has the concept of pop rock music which was developed by adding elements of jazz, folk, funk and ballad. Many music observers believe that this is the best album Dewa 19 has ever made that established them as one of the most creative big band groups in Indonesia. The December 2007 issue of Rolling Stone Magazine, put the album in 26th position in the list of \\"150 Best Indonesian Albums of All Time\\". Meanwhile, her first single, titled \\"Cukup Siti Nurbaya\\" was ranked 20th in the list of \\"150 Best Indonesian Songs of All Time\\" by the December 2009 issue of Rolling Stone magazine. Apart from \\"Cukup Siti Nurbaya\\", the Best Best album also released other hit singles such as \\"Satu Hati (We Should)\\" and the ballad \\"Cinta 'Kan Membawamu Kembali\\". Through this album Dewa won another BASF Awards for \\"Best Rock Music Group\\", \\"Best Recording Group / Duo\\" and \\"Best Recorded Music System\\". The video clip of \\"Cukup Siti Nurbaya\\" was also awarded as the \\"Best Video Clip\\" at the Indonesian Music Video event. Best Best Album has sold 500,000 copies in Indonesia. Since this album also Dewa 19 began using the term Baladewa to refer to his fans. Wong Aksa departed after the following album Pandawa Lima was finished in 1997 and was replaced by Bimo Sulaksono, a former member of Netral. Not long thereafter Bimo left Dewa 19 and together with Bebi formed the band Romeo. Dewa 19's fourth album entitled Pandawa Lima was released in 1997. Through this album, Dewa 19 won 6 awards at the 1997 Indonesian Music Award, namely for \\"Best Alternative Songs\\", \\"General Best Songs\\", \\"Duo / Best Alternative Groups\\", \\"Best Rhythm & Blues Album\\" and \\"Best Album Cover\\". This album gave birth to a number of hits including \\"Kirana\\" and \\"Kamulah Satu- Satunya\\". Both of these songs won the Indonesian Music Video award as \\"Favorite Video Clips\\". Pandawa Lima has sold more than 800 thousand pieces and received a 5x Platinum certificate In addition to the problem of frequent changes to the lineup, Dewa 19 also suffered from the implications of the alleged drug addiction problems of two other band members. Erwin entered a rehabilitation program to end a drug dependency which was ultimately successful. Ari Lasso also experienced drug addiction problem that led to his vocal difficulties which made Ari depart from the band in 1999, and Dhani insisted that the vocalist role be replaced by Once whom he met in 1997. The vacant drummer's seat was taken by Tyo Nugros. In 1999, Dewa released the album The Best of Dewa 19, which contained his best works during Ari Lasso being a vocalist. This album contains two new songs namely \\"Elang\\" and \\"Persembahan dari Surga\\". This album was once again successful even without a piece of promotion with sold over 1.000.000 copies. 2000-2011: blockbuster success and disbanded In 2000, Dewa made a breakthrough, along with the release time of their fifth album Bintang Lima, the band changed their name from Dewa 19 back to Dewa. Bintang Lima was a huge commercial success, selling over 1.7 million copies in Indonesia. It is the highest selling album in the band's career history. When they recorded the album, Erwin returned to the band as bass guitar player. In this album their signature songs are Roman Picisan, Dua Sejoli, Risalah Hati, Separuh Nafas, Lagu Cinta & Sayap-Sayap Patah. . Dewa then toured 36 cities to promote the album while introducing their new formation. Through this album, Dewa won three AMI Awards 2000, namely \\"Best Singer / Group\\", \\"Best Song\\" (\\"Roman Picisan\\") and \\"Best Album\\". Rolling Stone Magazine ranked the album 96th in the list of \\"150 Best Indonesian Albums\\". In 2002, Arjuna Mencari Cinta, one of Dewa's hit songs in the album, Cintailah Cinta, was plagued by copyright issues and eventually the band was forced to change the name to \\"Arjuna\\" only. Erwin left due to differences with the band's management and was replaced by Yuke Sampurna, former bassist of The Groove. In this album their signature songs are Arjuna, Kosong, Mistikus Cinta, Pupus, Cintailah Cinta, Kasidah Cinta, & Air Mata. . This album also gained success like its predecessor. Before it was officially released on the market this album had even sold 200,000 copies. Total album sales have reached more than 1.04 million copies. At the 2002 AMI Awards, Dewa was given three awards for the categories \\"Best Duo / Pop Group\\", \\"Best Song\\" (\\"Arjuna\\") and \\"Best Album Cover\\". In 2004, Dewa released a live album entitled Atas Nama Cinta I & II followed by the studio album Laskar Cinta. Later, in the same year, Dewa returned their name to Dewa 19 again.

This year, Dewa was also named the \\"Surabaya Ambassador\\" for their success and achievements as a music group originating from Surabaya In 2007, Tyo Nugros left Dewa 19 due to a leg injury that left him unable to play drums. He was replaced by Agung Yudha. Dewa 19 held large-scale concerts in five cities in Malaysia, namely: Kota Kinabalu, Kuching, Johor Bahru, Penang and Kuala Lumpur during December 2007.

When a new technology emerges (e.g. computer GUI operating systems) ‚Äì often firms will introduce a number of alternative designs (e.g. Microsoft ‚Äì Windows, Apple Inc. ‚Äì Mac OS and IBM ‚Äì OS/2). Updated designs will be released incorporating incremental improvements. At some point, an architecture that becomes accepted as the industry standard(Anderson and Tushman, 1990) may emerge such as Microsoft Windows. The dominant design has the effect of enforcing or encouraging standardization so that production or other complementary economies can be sought. Utterback and Suarez (1993) argue that the competitive effects of economies of scale only become important after the emergence of a dominant design, when competition begins to take place on the basis of cost and scale in addition to product features and performance.Utterback, J. M. and F. F. Suarez (1993). 'Innovation, competition, and industry structure', Research Policy, 22 (1), p 1. Dominant designs may not be better than other designs; they simply incorporate a set of key features that sometimes emerge due to technological path-dependence and not necessarily strict customer preferences. The often cited example is the QWERTY keyboard, specifically designed to overcome operative limitations on the mechanical typewriter but now almost universally preferred over other keyboard designs. Dominant designs end up capturing the allegiance of the marketplace and this can be due to network effects, technological superiority, or strategic manoeuvering by the sponsoring firms. Dominant designs are often only identified after they emerge. Some authors consider the dominant design as emerging when a design acquires more than 50% of the market share.Anderson, P., Tushman, M., 1990. Technological discontinuities and dominant designs: a cyclical model of technological change. Administrative Science Quarterly 35 (4), 604‚Äì635. A more promising approach is to study the specific product innovations introduced by different firms over time to determine which ones are retained.Christensen, C.M., Suarez, F.F., Utterback, J., 1998. Strategies for survival in fast- changing industries. Management Science 44 (12), 207‚Äì220 Origins of the theory Utterback and Abernathy first introduced the concept of 'dominant design' in 1975.James M. Utterback and William J. Abernathy, A Dynamic Model of Product and Process Innovation, Omega 3(6) (1975) 639-656. They proposed that the emergence of a dominant design is a major milestone in an industry evolution and changed the way firms compete in an industry and thus, the type of organizations that succeed and prevail. A dominant design can be a new technology, product or a set of key features incorporated from different distinct technological innovations introduced independently in prior product variants. Their 1975 paper, however, never uses the term 'dominant design.' It does refer to \\"dominant strategy\\" and \\"dominant type of innovations\\". Yet, in their 1993 work, Suarez and Utterback reference the 1975 paper as the source of the concept of 'Dominant design' David Teece, of later fame for the theory of dynamic capabilities, overtly develops the concept of dominant design in his 1984 paper on Profiting from technological innovation, in which he acknowledges the contribution of Utterback and Abernathy in their conceptual treatment of the evolution of technology in an industry. Dominant theory process The process by which a specific design achieves dominance consists of a few characteristic milestones:F. F. Suarez (2004). ‚ÄòBattles for technological dominance: an integrative framework‚Äô, pp 9-11. #A pioneer firm or research organization begins conducting R&D; with the intention of creating a new commercial product or improving an existing design. #The first working prototype of the new product/ technology is introduced, sending a signal to competitors to review the feasibility of their research programs. #The first commercial product is launched, connecting consumers to this new architecture for the first time. It is usually directed at a small group of customers. This milestone acts as a ‚Äúlast minute call‚Äù for competitors to review and speed up their research efforts. #A clear front-runner emerges from the early market. For example, in the personal computer industry, Apple Computers dominated after the introduction of their Apple I in 1976. #Finally, at some point in time, a particular technological trajectory achieves dominance and this marks the final milestone in the dominance process. Evidence and examples Dominant design milestones have been identified in many product lines. The emergence of a dominant design typically coincides with the point at which the number of firms competing in the industry peaks. Once it emerges, it implicitly sends a message to producers and consumers that its key features is a \\"must have\\" by future products. Examples of a dominant design include the simple four function calculator and the iPod and iPhone. Other examples include: * War of the currents between alternating- and direct-current electricity in the late 1800s. * The videotape format war between Betamax and VHS, when VHS became the de facto video tape standard. * The desktop metaphor introduced by Xerox's Alto became the dominant design in PC operating systems. * A review of the Samsung Z5 MP3 player articulated the Apple/iPod dominant design, David Pogue, \\"Almost iPod, but in the End a Samsung\\", The New York Times, March 9, 2006. * Many industry examples are included in Utterback's book Mastering the Dynamics of Innovation (see references below) * DC-3 Peter Senge book The Fifth Discipline on p. 6 cited the DC-3 as a dominant design consisting of variable-pitch propeller, retractable landing gear, monocoque, radial air-cooled engine, and wing flaps. * Philips Ambient Health Experience is one of the appropriate examples in the healthcare industry Implications for innovation and competitive dynamics Utterback and Suarez propose that once a dominant design emerges, it can have a profound impact on both the direction of further technical advance, on the rate of that advance, and on the resulting industry structure and competitive dynamics. Prior to the creation of the dominant design, firms are constantly experimenting and therefore cannot enjoy economies of scale. After the emergence of the dominant design, some firms accumulate complementary assets and exploit possible economies of scale, which in turn raises entry and mobility barriers in the industry. Firms that enter the industry during a period of experimentation risk choosing the wrong technological path, but have high upside if they choose the right one. Pre-dominant design entrants have been shown to have a higher chance of survival than those that enter after the emergence of the dominant design.Utterback, J. M. and F. F. Suarez (1995). ‚ÄòDominant designs and the survival of firms‚Äô. Utterback and Kim (1985) and Anderson and Tushman (1990) considered the effect of a disruption that invades a mature industry and thus starts a new cycle. In each cycle, the number of firms increases in the early (‚Äúfluid‚Äù or ‚Äúferment‚Äù) period, reaches a peak with the emergence of the dominant design, decreases until a few firms dominate the industry, and then restarts again when a disruption creates the conditions for a new wave of entry and the re-enactment of the industry life cycle.

From a thermodynamic perspective, a substance is inert, or nonlabile, if it is thermodynamically unstable (positive standard Gibbs free energy of formation) yet decomposes at a slow, or negligible rate. Most Group 8 or 18 elements that appear in the last column of the periodic table (Helium, Neon, Argon, Krypton, Xenon and Radon) are classified as inert (or unreactive). These elements are stable in their naturally occurring form (gaseous form) and they are called inert gases. Noble gas The noble gases were previously known as 'inert gases' because of their perceived lack of participation in any chemical reactions. The reason for this is that their outermost electron shells (valence shells) are completely filled, so that they have little tendency to gain or lose electrons. They are said to acquire a noble gas configuration, or a full electron configuration. It is now known that most of these gases in fact do react to form chemical compounds, such as xenon tetrafluoride. Hence, they have been renamed to 'noble gases', as the only two of these we know truly to be inert are helium and neon. However, a large amount of energy is required to drive such reactions, usually in the form of heat, pressure, or radiation, often assisted by catalysts. The resulting compounds often need to be kept in moisture-free conditions at low temperatures to prevent rapid decomposition back into their elements. Inert gas The term inert may also be applied in a relative sense. For example, molecular nitrogen is an inert gas under ordinary conditions, existing as diatomic molecules, . The presence of a strong triple covalent bond in the molecule renders it unreactive under normal circumstances. Nevertheless, nitrogen gas does react with the alkali metal lithium to form compound lithium nitride (Li3N), even under ordinary conditions. Under high pressures and temperatures and with the right catalysts, nitrogen becomes more reactive; the Haber process uses such conditions to produce ammonia from atmospheric nitrogen.  Main uses  Inert atmospheres consisting of gases such as argon, nitrogen, or helium are commonly used in chemical reaction chambers and in storage containers for oxygen-sensitive or water-sensitive substances, to prevent unwanted reactions of these substances with oxygen or water. Argon is widely used in fluorescence tubes and low energy light bulbs. Argon gas helps to protect the metal filament inside the bulb from reacting with oxygen and corroding the filament under high temperature. Neon is used in making advertising signs. Neon gas in a vacuum tube glows bright red in colour when electricity is passed through. Different coloured neon lights can also be made by using other gases. Helium gas is mainly used to fill hot air and party balloons. Balloons filled with it float upwards and this phenomenon is achieved as helium gas is less dense than air.

The state government was petitioned in 1910 by the Yuna Farmer's Association to survey lots in 1910. The government delayed acting on the request until the Upper Chapman railway line extension route was decided on. This was completed in 1912 and then some wrangling over the best townsite ensued. One site to the west near a spring and close to the railway line was dubbed West Yuna and a siding was built; it was gazetted as West Yuna in 1913, then changed to Whelarra in 1918 and finally cancelled in 1968. The Yuna Agricultural Hall was built in 1919 then gutted by fire and then completely collapsing in 1922. Because of the site at West Yuna, development of the current site was initially opposed by the government and mined for pottery clay. A school was erected in 1927 and then the government decided to assist with development with lots being surveyed in 1929. The name is Aboriginal in origin and was first recorded in 1863 as Younah Springs; it is thought to mean bad or rotten meat. The main industry in town is wheat farming, with the town being a Cooperative Bulk Handling receival site.  Transport  It was the terminus of the railway line from Wokarina. The line opened on 3 May 1912 and closed on 29 April 1957.Milne, Rod The Yuna Branch, Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, August, 1990 pp179-186 In 1932 the Wheat Pool of Western Australia announced that the town would have two grain elevators, each fitted with an engine, installed at the railway siding.

Life On finishing his studies in Vienna, he attached himself to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Gy≈ër, and in 1560 was sent by his bishop to the German College at Rome. Here he joined the Jesuit order, and after his novitiate was ordained priest. In 1566 he returned to Vienna, and thence went as professor to Nagyszombat (now Trnava, Slovakia). The succeeding years were spent at the universities of Vienna and Graz, where he lectured on philosophy. In 1568 Sz√°nt√≥ strove to found a Catholic mission for Transylvania, where Protestantism was making great headway; this project he continued in Rome, wither he was summoned in 1579 as Hungarian penitentiary. This last position he held until 1579. His endeavours to found a Hungarian College in Rome after the model of the German College met with but temporary success. The monastery of the Hermits of St. Paul near Santo Stefano Rotondo on the Coelian was to serve for this purpose; the deed of foundation was approved by Pope Gregory XIII, and the college was opened on 28 May 1579. The pope, however, soon united the college with the German College. At the end of 1579 Sz√°nt√≥ left Rome, and proceeded to Transylvania, and the Catholic missions at Kolozsv√°r (now Cluj-Napoca, Romania); and later at V√°rad (now Oradea, Romania). At this time occurred his literary polemics with the Protestant preacher Peter Beregsz√°szi, against which he wrote his Epistola apologetica. In 1585, Sz√°nt√≥ proceeded to Gyulafeh√©rv√°r (now Alba Iulia, Romania), and thence, on the expulsion of the Jesuit order from Transylvania, to V√°gsellye (today ≈†aƒæa, Slovakia). In 1600 he went to Zni√≥v√†ralja (now Kl√°≈°tor pod Znievom, Slovakia), and in 1605, on the destruction of this place by the troops of Bocskay, to Olm√ºtz, where he remained until his death. Works During the siege of Zni√≥v√†ralja his books and manuscripts, including the Hungarian catechism which he composed in Rome, were lost; until his death, he was working on a translation of the New Testament, which was later used by Gy√∂rgy K√°ldy. Sz√°nt√≥ must also be credited with the Hungarian portion of the dictionary of Calepino.

Due to its location, it is also known as B√¨nh ƒêi·ªán Temple. History The temple was built by Th√≠ch B·ª≠u Phong in the 17th century, at which point it was only a small shrine. The ƒê·∫°i Nam nh·∫•t th·ªëng ch√≠, the official court records of the Nguy·ªÖn lords that ruled southern Vietnam during this period, said that the temple was to the south of Ph∆∞·ªõc Ch√°nh district, to the west of a large mountain range and to the north of Long ·∫®n mountain. The chronicle made a note of the idyllic scenery of the surrounding area, which it praised as the best in the province. As a result of the temple's presence, it was also known as B·ª≠u Phong mountain. Towards the end of the 18th century, a large number of ethnic Chinese immigrants came into southern Vietnam following the fall of the Ming Dynasty, many of whom were Buddhists. The Chinese settlers rebuilt the original temple, equipping it with a tiled roof. They invited Zen master Th√≠ch Th√†nh Tr√≠, from the 36th generation of the T√†o ƒê·ªông Zen lineage, to come and become the abbot of the temple. Zen master Th√≠ch Ph√°p Th√¥ng was also responsible for the construction of the nearby Long ·∫®n Temple on the Long ·∫®n mountain directly in front of B·ª≠u Long mountain. There is now a hexagonal stupa at Long ·∫®n Temple for Th√≠ch Ph√°p Th√¥ng's remains. According to the records of Nguy·ªÖn Hi·ªÅn ƒê·ª©c in the book Thi·ªÅn s∆∞ Vi·ªát Nam (Vietnamese Zen masters) compiled by Th√≠ch Thanh T·ª´, Th√≠ch Ph√°p Th√¥ng had no disciples to continue his lineage, so the Zen Master Th√≠ch Vi√™n Quang from Minh H∆∞∆°ng, from the 36th generation of the L√¢m T·∫ø lineage became the abbot of the temple. In 1760, he held a renovation of the temple. In 1829, the temple was rebuilt and expanded due to large donations made by Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Hi·ªáp and Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn T√¢m. The temple was later refurbished further in the late 19th century and also in the 20th century. Features From the road to the entrance of the temple, there are 100 steps up the side of the hill. At the entrance is a large arched triple gate. At the front of the temple, there are inscriptions of verses on the wall. In front of the temple is a statue of Avalokiteshvara bodhisattva, erected in 1963. Inside the highly decorated main hall is a historic statue of Amitabha Buddha. There is also a stupa behind the main hall where a sample of the relics of Gautama Buddha are enshrined. In present times, B·ª≠u Long mountain has become an important tourist and historical attraction of ƒê·ªìng Nai Province. In the surrounding area, there are further stupas and statues which depict three key moments in the life of Gautama Buddha: his birth as Prince Siddhartha at Lumbini, his enlightenment under the bodhi tree at Bodh Gaya and the entering into nirvana at Kusinara.

It is one of the best-known temples in the region. The temple stands on a block filled with fruit trees in the village of M·ªπ H√≥a in the town of M·ªπ Phong, on the banks of the B·∫£o ƒê·ªãnh canal. Vƒ©nh Tr√†ng Pagoda Statue of Budai (B·ªë ƒê·∫°i) In the middle of the 19th century, the temple came into being through the endeavours of the district chief B√πi C√¥ng ƒê·∫°t, who organised its erection. He recruited the monk Th√≠ch T·ª´ L√¢m from B·ª≠u L√¢m Temple to preside over Vƒ©nh Tr√†ng. Following the death of B√πi C√¥ng ƒê·∫°t, Th√≠ch Hu·ªá ƒêƒÉng presided over the remainder of the construction phase and the temple was completed in 1850. Between 1859 and 1862, French colonial forces battled the army of the Nguy·ªÖn Dynasty of Emperor T·ª± ƒê·ª©c. The French army prevailed and T·ª± ƒê·ª©c ceded three southern provinces to become the colony of Cochinchina. In the fighting, Vƒ©nh Tr√†ng was seriously damaged. The successor of Th√≠ch Hu·ªá ƒêƒÉng was Th√≠ch Thi·ªán ƒê·ªÅ, and he oversaw the reconstruction efforts. After his death, the temple fell into disuse. In 1890, Th√≠ch Tr√† Ch√°nh was recruited from S·∫Øc t·ª© Linh Th·ª©u Temple to become the abbot of the temple. The new abbot hailed from M·ªπ Tho and was a disciple of Th√≠ch Minh Ph∆∞·ªõc. In 1895, Th√≠ch Ch√°nh H·∫≠u organised a complete renovation of the temple. In 1904, the temple was ravaged in a large tropical storm, requiring a major rebuilding in 1907. Th√≠ch Ch√°nh H·∫≠u presided as the abbot for 33 years until his death in 1923. His successor Th√≠ch Minh ƒê√†n, organised further renovations including the main triple gate, main ceremonial hall and the patriarch hall. The main triple gate was built in 1933 through the labour of craftsmen recruited from the imperial capital in Hu·∫ø, central Vietnam. The central gate is made from steel, while the two side gates are made from concrete and styled akin to a historical fortress. The triple gate has an upper level with another large gate on top. On the right is the statue of Th√≠ch Ch√°nh H·∫≠u and on the left is a statue of Th√≠ch Minh ƒê√†n. Both sculptures were made of statue and were made by Nguy·ªÖn Phi Hoanh. The front of the temple is designed in a style that mixes European and Asian architecture. In the main hall of the temple, there are multiple statues of various Buddhas including Amitabha Buddha, Gautama Buddha, various arahants and bodhisattvas. There are also statues of Th√≠ch Ch√°nh H·∫≠u and Th√≠ch Minh ƒê√†n. The three oldest statues in the temple are those of Amitabha, Avalokiteshvara and ƒê·∫°i Th·∫ø Ch√≠ bodhisattva, which are made of bronze. However, the statue of Avalokiteshvara has been lost for a long time, so a wooden replacement was made. There is also a statue of the Jade Emperor, roughly the size of a real human. The statues of 18 arahants are carved from wood and were made in 1907 by a group of southern craftsmen. Each statue is approximately tall and in width. The garden of the temple is decorated with many pot plants and are tended to on a regular basis. Under the shade of one tree is the stupa of Th√≠ch Ch√°nh H·∫≠u, in which his ashes are interred. The temple is currently the office of the board of the provincial Buddhist Association of Ti·ªÅn Giang Province. It is a major provincial destination for tourists and pilgrims.

Terpl√°n was born in the Ivanovci in the Prekmurje region in the Kingdom of Hungary, into a Hungarian Slovene Lutheran family. Several priests were born in his village, both Catholic and Lutheran, including litt√©rateurs or gentilitial politicians, such as J√≥zsef Borovnj√°k and Ferenc Ivan√≥czy. Terpl√°n's father Iv√°n Terplan was a tailor and wine-merchant and estate manager of Baron Szaller in Ivanovci.

The New England group included the three remaining ASL teams along with Victoria Mills of the Southern New England Association who qualified by defeating Fairlawn Rovers. The Round Robin was somewhat unpopular because of the methods used. Despite a league setup, games tied at the end of regulation were to go into overtime. In the event of a tie in the standings, goal average was used to break the tie. A slight controversy ensued when a game between Boston and Fall River was called at the 78th minute with the score 0-0. Fall River later forfeited the replay leaving Boston tied for first with Pawtucket. The Rangers advanced on better goal average leaving Boston unable to make up the difference in a replay with Fall River or a playoff with Pawtucket.

Feel and Gainax partnered together to adapt the series into a thirteen episode anime series. The first season, , aired on October 2, 2008 on AT-X and finished on December 25, 2008. A second season, , aired between January and March 2009. The anime is licensed for North American distribution and release by Funimation Entertainment, which has released the episodes in subtitled form as Shikabane Hime through various online distribution companies and through its own website. The series made its North American television debut on the FUNimation Channel on November 15, 2010. Plot After being murdered, Makina Hoshimura turns into a living \\"Shikabane Hime\\" (\\"Corpse Princess\\"). Armed with dual MAC-11 submachine guns, she must kill 108 other Shikabane in order to gain entry into heaven. She is assisted in this task by Keisei Tagami, a Buddhist monk with links to an anti- corpse group known as the K≈çgon Sect. Her ultimate goal is to avenge the death of her family, by destroying the Shikabane known as the Seven Stars. Characters Main ; : :Makina is the main protagonist and titular \\"living corpse\\". She is tasked with killing 108 corpses to gain entrance to heaven. She has formidable physical skills and her weapon of choice are two Ingram MAC-11 submachine guns. Her Contracted Monk was Keisei Tagami. Later in the story, it is revealed that her family discovered the process of making a Shikabane Hime and was killed by the Seven Stars whom made Makina into a Shikabane. Later on, after Keisei's death, Ouri became her new Contracted Monk, although she refused to accept him at first. ; : :A normal high school boy who was raised at Keisei Tagami's temple. He treats Keisei as his brother even though they are not blood related. Ouri is able to appear where the Shikabane are because of a mysterious black cat who began to talk to him. After the second time talking to the cat, Ouri knew that when he saw the cat he had to follow it, leading him to the corpses. He has also been nicknamed by the children at the temple \\"Hanagami\\". Later on after Keisei's death, he became Makina's new Contracted Monk. In the anime, it is strongly implied that he is in love with Makina. ; : :Keisei Tagami was a Buddhist priest under the anti-corpse organization known as the K≈çugon Sect. He found Ouri Kagami as a three-year-old child and raised him at his temple orphanage. Keisei was an orphan himself, raised by Makina Hoshimura's father. When the Hoshimura family was brutally murdered, he agreed to become Makina's Contracted Monk. He was something of a pervert, often offering (or forcing upon) Ouri sexual posters or skin mags. He died near the end of the first season. Contracted Monks ; : :Rika Aragami is the only female Contracted Monk. She is one of the ten Great Holy Families, which are the descendants of the ten senior disciples of the Founder and obligated to become Contracted Monk to a Shikabane Hime. Not only is she the Contracted Monk of Saki Amase, but she is well known for her ability to heal others, and her inability to button her shirt. ; : :The Contracted Monk of Itsuki Yamagami. Their relationship is a complicated one. While the two seem to have a romantic relationship, they are incapable of acting on their feelings due to Itsuki's nature as a Shikibane. Both he and Itsuki try to prevent Ouri from making a similar mistake with Makina, but at the same time their actions show signs that they want Ouri to prove them wrong.

Isaki was made a contracted monk due to his brother's contacts. He intended to use Minai to kill his older brother, and claim the reasons that Minai killed his brother was because he was unholy and became a Shikabane.

When a person dies with a powerful regret or obsession, they may become a Shikabane. As a Shikabane, they are undead but retain some degree of memory and intelligence. Their appearance may also differ greatly from that of a human. Shikabane are given superhuman strength and a unique ability or attribute called a curse.

A Shikabane can be killed by destroying or otherwise severing their brains. ;Shikabane Hime :Shikabane Hime are Shikabane that follow the K≈çgon Sect. So far only girls of a certain age group can become a Shikabane Hime. Each of them is partnered with a monk, who provides them with life energy called Rune. In exchange, the Shikabane Hime act as shields for their monk. They are used to hunt and kill rogue Shikabane. In fact, once they kill 108 Shikabane, they receive the reward of going to Heaven (this number may be from the number of sins in Buddhism). Shikabane Hime keep their human form but do still have their own curses that occasionally manifest, and unlike rogue Shikabane, Shikabane Hime are not driven by their regrets or obsessions to the same degree of madness. If their partner monk dies and a replacement is not forthcoming, however, the Shikabane Hime usually die or become Shikabane. Despite their contribution to the fight against the rogue Shikabane, they are shunned by most of the K≈çgon Sect followers due to their nature as Shikabane. ;Contracted Monk :Contracted Monks are the partner monks of the Shikabane Hime. They usually provide their Shikabane Hime with support and are linked by a bond. ;Curse :A curse is a unique power that a Shikabane possess.

Episodes \\"'The Secrets of the Tomb Builders\\" Cruickshank finds out about the mysterious people who built the spectacular underground tombs of the Pharaohs. Cruickshank flies over the Valley of the Kings where the pharaohs hid their tombs over 3,500 years ago. Over 60 tombs are dug into the walls of the valley where the bodies and riches inside could be guarded from tomb robbers. Descending into the massive KV5, built by Rameses II for his sons, Cruickshank is able to admire the precise engineering skills of its builders. In the Tomb of Horemheb, sealed before it could be completed, he admires the unfinished work of the tomb artists. At Deir el- Medina he sees where the generations of builder, painters, sculptors and engineers who built the tombs lived with their families kept separate from the rest of the world. From the wealth of archaeological evidence (scraps of cloth, fragments of wood, traces of paint) archaeologist have built up a detailed picture of the tomb builders‚Äô lives. Cruickshank ponders the life of an ancient family of tomb builders at the house of Senagem. The builders were highly literate and thousands of examples of their writing on limestone and pottery have been uncovered giving detailed and intimate insights into ancient Egyptian life. From these ostraca we can see that they were not slaves but well cared for state employees who held some of the most important secrets of the state but court documents reveal these were also the tomb robbers. Cruickshank explains how this journey has changed his view of the valley from a place of death, afterlife, ritual and religion into a place of ordinary people and their daily lives. This insight into life in this land thousands of years ago is history from the bottom up a long way from the propaganda left behind by the pharaohs. \\"The Pharaoh Hunter\\" Cruickshank follows in the footsteps of Howard Carter to trace the life of the man who discovered the Tomb of Tutankhamun. Cruickshank attributes the discovery of the treasure of Tutankahmun to the sheer tenacity of Carter. Carter's solitary upbringing by maiden aunts in rural Norfolk is credited as the source of his self-reliance and sense of being an outsider. Carter left school aged 15 with little formal education but great artistic skills. Lord and Lady Amherst's Egyptian collection at nearby Diddlington Hall entranced Carter and they appointed him to a dig in Egypt. Arriving at the vibrantly decorated tombs at Beni Hasan he became disenchanted with the arid tracings he was instructed to produce and instead created beautiful watercolour renditions. Later he joined the dig at El Amarna and learned the scientific style of its leader Flinders Petrie. At 19, Carter was appointed site artist at the Temple of Queen Hatshepsut in Deir el-Bahri winning great acclaim with his newly acquired archaeological skill and was running the dig within 6 years. His subsequent appointment as Chief Inspector in Egyptian Antiquities Service arose resentment amongst more experienced archaeologists and was soon forced to resign. The outcast Carter eventually teamed up with Lord Carnarvon and the two began the search for Tutankhamun which eventually succeeded thanks to Carter's stubbornness. The project took over the life of the meticulous Carter who fell-out with Carnarvon over the disposition of the find further isolating him. Carter spent over a decade completing the excavation of the site before being gently pushed aside by the authorities and returning to a solitary existence in England where later he died leaving behind a magnificent archaeological legacy. \\"The Rebel Pharoah\\" Cruickshank goes on the trail of Egypt's most controversial ruler and his beautiful wife Nefertiti. The Pharaoh Akhenaten is described as a revolutionary whose dangerous ideas would change politics, religion, art and language leading the nation to the brink of catastrophe. Preserved statues of Akhnaten do not conform to the traditional depictions of a pharaoh highlighting his unconventional style. Early in his reign he underwent a religious conversion and proposed replacing the pantheon of gods with a single sun god. Wall paintings from the tomb of Chief Vizier Ramosa illustrate this overthrow. Akhnaten left the ancient capital of Luxor to build a religious utopia in the desert to break from the past and honour his new monotheistic god. The great temple at Amarna opened up to the sun but only the Pharaoh and his family were allowed in. Akhnaton came to believe that he was the son of god and should be worshipped as such. He initiated a persecution of believers in the old gods and Egypt lost status as the Pharaoh became disassociated from the real world. Art works preserved at the site show unprecedented images of the royal family displaying humanistic emotions of affection and grief. A plague sweeps the land, taking Akhnaten's wife and children, and the Pharaoh is held responsible as social order begins to fall apart. Akhnaten's death, possibly at the hands of his own courtiers, leads to his successor Tutankhamun abandoning Amarna and restoring the old gods. All trace of Akhnaten was buried, ironically preserving it for modern archaeologist. \\"Building for Eternity\\" Cruickshank explores how and why the ancient Egyptians made things to last forever, fuelled by their belief in eternity. Egyptian belief in an afterlife led to the development of ingenious techniques that have preserved much of their culture to this day. At Saqqara the Pharaoh Zoza built upon the traditional stone monument to create Egypt's first step pyramid as part of a stone complex designed to last forever. Zoza continually expanded his pyramid confirming the importance of size that culminated with the Great Pyramid of Khufu at Giza. Later monuments use granite ferried down the Nile from distant Aswan to achieve the same level of eternity. The Nile was the fertile centre of the Egyptian world and its seasonal cycle inspired the very idea of eternity. They developed mummification to maintain the body for this continuing renewal. Following preservation the heart was reinserted as the seat of the soul and rituals were conducted to reawaken the senses of the deceased. Ancient Egyptians also believed such rituals necessary for the annual flooding of the Nile and the rising of the sun and great temples such as the one at Dendera were built to facilitate this. The temples were the engines of eternity built on massive scale to last forever as a route from the world of man to that of the gods with only the most privileged allowed access. The longevity of the Egyptian civilisation allowed some to question the very nature of eternity as they witnessed the desolation of ancient monuments but much has survived allowing the ancients to live on. \\"Pharoah's Wives\\" Cruickshank goes on the trail of a pharaoh's wife who committed a crime so terrible they tried to wipe her name from history. The last of the great pharaohs Ramesses III died in mysterious circumstances surrounded by enemies and civil disobedience. In the first year of his reign he ordered the construction of Medinet-Habu filled with great depictions of his huge wealth and military victories and unprecedented depictions of his prowess with women. Ancient papyri bought on Cairo's black market in the 19th century however tell of an indecisive man unable even to choose between Tiye and Isis as his great queen. Tiye and Isis compete to have their son named as heir of Ramesses III and the Pharaoh eventually chooses Isis. Tiye plots to murder the Pharaoh and seize the country in a military coup. Tiye uses spells stolen from the Pharaoh's own library against him and recruits many important generals and courtiers into her conspiracy (including the food-taster). Ramesses's failing health and poor political decisions lead to civil disobedience and revolt across the country. Ti seizes the opportunity and within the month Ramesses III is dead presumably from poisoning. The subsequent coup however fails and Isis's son Pharaoh Ramesses IV round up the conspirators and puts them on trial. The harem women's final plot to seduce the judges is discovered and all the conspirators are executed. Isis and her son Pentawere are chiselled from history and only the papyri survive to tell their story. \\"The Death of Ancient Egypt\\" Cruickshank travels the length of the country to find out what brought this remarkable civilisation to an abrupt and tragic end. The arrival of Alexander the Great in 332 BC ushered in the 300 years rule of the Ptolemaic dynasty where Greek culture would challenge the old beliefs. The Greeks however were seduced by the mystery and magic of Ancient Egyptian and erected statues to the old god in their temples. Cleopatra, despite her Greek blood, became the archetypal Egyptian with even her legendary death at the bite of a sacred asp designed to usher her into the eternal pantheon of Egyptian deities. The Romans marched into Egypt in 30 BC intent on turning it into an imperial province and bled the country dry to sustain the Empires extensive territories. The vast resources of Egypt supplied one third of Romes grain as well as gold and granite. The country was bankrupted, the temples neglected and the priests disregarded but the beliefs lived on to seduce the Roman oppressors with some even being mummified. Christianity was adopted as the official religion of the Roman Empire and enforced upon the Egyptians. Greeks and Romans could blend their own pantheons with those of Egypt but Christianity was monotheistic and intolerant regarding old gods as devils. Ancient rituals were appropriated and transformed, including the Ptolomeic idea of monasticism, finally defeating the old gods by the mid-4th century when over half the Egyptian population had converted to Christianity and the rest were persecuted. The last of believers in the old faith retreated to the Island of Philae, where the last Demotic hieroglyphs were carved in 394 AD, and when this bastion finally fell a 3000-year-old culture had been wiped out and its knowledge forgotten.

History  The discipline of combinatorial topology used combinatorial concepts in topology and in the early 20th century this turned into the field of algebraic topology. In 1978 the situation was reversed ‚Äî methods from algebraic topology were used to solve a problem in combinatorics ‚Äì when L√°szl√≥ Lov√°sz proved the Kneser conjecture, thus beginning the new study of topological combinatorics. Lov√°sz's proof used the Borsuk‚ÄìUlam theorem and this theorem retains a prominent role in this new field. This theorem has many equivalent versions and analogs and has been used in the study of fair division problems. In another application of homological methods to graph theory Lov√°sz proved both the undirected and directed versions of a conjecture of Andr√°s Frank: Given a k-connected graph G, k points v_1,\\\\ldots,v_k \\\\in V(G), and k positive integers n_1,n_2,\\\\ldots,n_k that sum up to V(G), there exists a partition \\\\\\\\{V_1,\\\\ldots,V_k\\\\\\\\} of V(G) such that v_i \\\\in V_i, V_i=n_i, and V_i spans a connected subgraph. In 1987 the necklace splitting problem was solved by Noga Alon using the Borsuk‚ÄìUlam theorem. It has also been used to study complexity problems in linear decision tree algorithms and the Aanderaa‚ÄìKarp‚ÄìRosenberg conjecture. Other areas include topology of partially ordered sets and bruhat orders. Additionally, methods from differential topology now have a combinatorial analog in discrete Morse theory.

It is also known as Tripuri Purnima and Tripurari Purnima. It is sometimes called Deva-Diwali or Deva-Deepawali, the festival of lights of the gods. Karthikai Deepam is a related festival celebrated in Nepal, South India and Sri Lanka on a different date. Significance in Hinduism Here, the five-headed Tripurantaka is seen pointing an arrow towards the Tripura (rightmost top corner) with the bow made of mount Meru, the serpent Vasuki is seen as its string. The four-headed god Brahma is seen. The moon and the Sun are depicted as the wheels of the chariot. Tripuri Purnima or Tripurari Purnima derives its name from Tripurari - the foe of the demon Tripurasura. In some legends of Kartik Purnima, the term is used to denote the three demon sons of TƒÅrakƒÅsura. Tripurari is an epithet of god Shiva. Shiva in his form as Tripurantaka (\\"Killer of Tripurasura\\") killed Tripurasura on this day. Tripurasura had conquered the whole world and defeated the gods and also created three cities in space, together called \\"Tripura\\". The killing of the demon(s) and destruction of his/their cities with a single arrow - by Shiva overjoyed the gods and they declared the day as a festival of illuminations. This day is also called \\"Dev-Diwali\\"‚Äîthe Diwali of the gods. Diwali is the Hindu festival of lights. Kartik Purnima is also the birthday of Matsya, god Vishnu's fish-incarnation (avatar). It is also the birthday of Vrinda, the personification of the Tulsi plant and of Kartikeya, the god of war and son of Shiva. This day also is considered special for Radha, the lover of Krishna - Vishnu's incarnation. It is believed that Krishna and Radha danced rasa and Krishna worshipped Radha on this day. This day is also dedicated to the pitrs, dead ancestors. Underhill believes that the origins of this festival may lie in ancient times, when a sacrifice called Shakamedhah was performed to attain victory over enemies. The festival has even more significance when the day falls in the Nakshatra (lunar mansion) Krittika and is then called Maha Kartik. The nakshatra is Bharani, the results are stated to be special. If it is Rohini nakshatra, then the fruitful results are even much more. Any philanthropic act on this day is supposed to bring benefits and blessings equal to the performing of ten yajnas (sacrifices). Hindu rituals Kartik Purnima is closely associated with Prabodhini Ekadashi which marks the end of Chaturmas, a four-month period when Vishnu is believed to sleep. Prabodhini Ekadashi signifies the awakening of the god. Chaturmas penance ends on this day. Many fairs that begin on Prabodhini Ekadashi end on Kartik Purnima, Kartik Purnima usually being the most important day of the fair. Fairs that conclude on this day include Prabodhini Ekadashi celebrations at Pandharpur and Pushkar Fair. Kartik Purnima is also the last day to perform Tulsi Vivah ceremony that can be performed from Prabodhini Ekadashi. Also, it is believed that Vishnu, on this day, returns to his abode after completing his stay in Bali. Hence, the day is known as Deva- Diwali.Swaminarayan Smapradaya - Dev Diwali Significance Pushkar Mela, 2006 In Pushkar, Rajasthan, the Pushkar Fair or Pushkar mela commences on Prabodhini Ekadashi and continues till Kartik Purnima, the latter being the most important. This fair is held in honour of god Brahma, whose temple stands at Pushkar. A ritual bath on Kartik Purnima in the Pushkar Lake is considered to lead one to salvation. It is believed circling the three Pushkars on Kartik Purnima is highly meritorious. Sadhus gather here and stay from Ekadashi to full moon day in caves. About 200,000 people and 25,000 camels assemble in Pushkar for the fair. Pushkar fair is Asia's largest camel fair.Fairs and Festivals of India By S.P.

This holy bath is known as \\"Kartik snana\\". An holy bath at Pushkar or in the Ganges river, especially at Varanasi is deemed as most auspicious. Kartik Purnima is the most popular day for bathing in the Ganges at Varanasi. The devotees also take a bath in the evening during moonrise and offer worship by way of six prayers such as Shiva sambuti, Satait and so forth. Annakuta, an offering of food to the deities, is held in temples. People who have taken vows on Ashvin full moon day, end them on Kartik Purnima. God Vishnu is also worshipped on this day. Any form of violence (hinsa or himsa) is prohibited on this day. This includes shaving, hair-cutting, cutting of trees, plucking of fruits and flowers, cutting of crops and even, sexual union. Charity especially donation of cows, feeding of Brahmins, fasting are religious activities prescribed for Kartik Purnima. Giving gift of gold is said to fulfill all desires of people. Tripuri Purnima is only next to Maha Shivaratri, amongst festivals dedicated to Shiva worship.The Hindu religious year By M.M. Underhill pp.95-96 To commemorate the killing of Tripurasura, images of Shiva are carried in procession. Temple complexes in southern India are lit up throughout the night. Deepmalas or towers of lights are illuminated in temples. People place 360 or 720 wicks in temples, to secure escape reaching hell after death. The 720 wicks symbolizes the 360 days and nights of the Hindu calendar. In Varanasi, the ghats come alive with thousands of diyas (brightly lit earthen lamps).[Guests at God's wedding: celebrating Kartik among the women of BenaresBy Tracy Pintchman pp. 83-7] People gift lamps to priests. The lamps are kept throughout the night in houses and Shiva temples. This day is also known as \\"Kartik Diparatna\\" - the jewel of lamps in Kartik. Lights are also floated in miniature boats in rivers. Lights are placed under Tulsi, Sacred fig and Amla trees. The lights in the water and under trees are believed to help fishes, insects and birds who saw the light to attain salvation.Keys of Power: A Study of Indian Ritual and Belief By J. Abbott pp.203-4 In Odisha, on Kartik Purnima, people celebrate Boita Bandana(Odia: ‡¨¨‡≠ã‡¨á‡¨§ ‡¨¨‡¨®‡≠ç‡¨¶‡¨æ‡¨£) by heading for the nearest water body to set afloat miniature boats, originally made out of banana stem and coconut stick, lit with Deepak(lamps), fabric, betel leaves. Boita stands for boat or ship. The festival is a mass commemoration of the state's glorious maritime history when it was known as Kalinga and tradesmen and mariners known as sadhabas traveled on boitas to trade with distant island nations that share borders with the Bay of Bengal like Indonesia, Java, Sumatra and Bali. People in Odisha celebrate Kartik Purnima by setting afloat miniature boita (boats) made from banana stem to remember the historical significance of the day. In Tamil Nadu, Karthikai Deepam is celebrated where the Purnima corresponds to the Krittika nakshatra. People light rows of lamps on their balconys. In Tiruvannamalai, a ten-day annual festival is held to celebrate Karthikai Deepam. In Telugu households of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karthika Maasalu (month) is considered very auspicious. The Kartika month starts on the day of Deepawali. From that day till the end of the month, oil lamps are lit every day. On Karthika Puranam (full moon of Kartheeka month) oil lamp with 365 wicks, prepared at home, are lit in Lord Shiva temples. Apart from that, Kartika Puranam is read and fasting is observed till sunset, every day for the whole month. Swaminarayan Sampraday also celebrates this day with faith and fervor. Jainism Palitana Jain temples Kartik Purnima is an important religious day for Jains who celebrate it by visiting Palitana a Jain pilgrimage centre. Thousands of Jain pilgrims flock to the foothills of Shatrunjay hills of Palitana taluka on the day of Kartik Purnima to undertake the auspicious yatra (journey). Also known as the Shri Shantrunjay Teerth Yatra, this walk is an important religious event in the life of a Jain devotee, who covers 216 km of rough mountainous terrain on foot to worship at the Lord Adinath temple atop the hill. Considered to be a very auspicious day for Jains, the day also assumes more significance for the walk, as the hills, which are closed to the public during the four months of Chaturmas, are thrown open for the devotees on Kartik Purnima. The day of Kartik Purnima is very significant in Jainism. As devotees are kept away from worshipping their lord for four months of the monsoon season, the first day attracts the maximum number of devotees. Jains believe that Adinath, the first tirthankara, sanctified the hills by visiting it to deliver his first sermon. According to Jain texts, millions of sadhus and Sadhvis have attained salvation on these hills. Buddhism In Buddhism, Kartika Purnima is an important day. On this day, Lord Buddha preached Dhamma to one his chief disciples, Sariputta and he embraced Buddhism. Also, Sariputta is said to have attained Nirvana on the same day after few years. Hence, this day is often honoured as 'Sariputta Divasa' (day of Sariputta). Another incident is after the Mahaparinirvana of Lord Buddha, his ash relics were kept at Takshashila. However, his disciples wanted the relics back to the Gangetic valley, so one of his disciples bought the relics to Sarnath near Varanasi where Lord Buddha gave his first sermon. He deposited it at the 'Mulagandha Kuti Vihara' in Sarnath on this day, and the Vihara is located even today in Sarnath. This place is considered highly sacred. Buddhists from countries like Sri Lanka, China, Japan, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Vietnam, etc. visit this VihƒÅra on this day. Buddhists maintain a strict fast, abstain from non-vegetarian foods, circumambulate Stupas and donate Bhikshus with food. Sikhism There are no auspicious days in Sikhism. Any month, day or moment a person remembers the Divine is considered auspicious. Guru Nanak was born on 1 Vaisakh, April 14, according to the (Sikh) Nanakshahi calendar. It happened to be a full-moon night.Nanakpanthi Hindus and other followers of Guru Nanak's philosophy celebrate this festival on Kartik Purnima, according to the (Hindu) Bikrami calendar. Kartik Purnima is celebrated as Gurupurab or Prakash Parva that is Guru Nanak Jayanti Worldwide.

Tucker's lemma states that for such a triangulation at least one such 1-simplex must exist. In mathematics, Tucker's lemma is a combinatorial analog of the Borsuk-Ulam theorem, named after Albert W. Tucker. Let T be a triangulation of the closed n-dimensional ball B_n. Assume T is antipodally symmetric on the boundary sphere S_{n-1}. That means that the subset of simplices of T which are in S_{n-1} provides a triangulation of S_{n-1} where if œÉ is a simplex then so is ‚àíœÉ. Let L:V(T)\\\\to\\\\\\\\{+1,-1,+2,-2,...,+n,-n\\\\\\\\} be a labeling of the vertices of T which is an odd function on S_{n-1}, i.e, L(-v) = -L(v) for every vertex v\\\\in S_{n-1}. Then Tucker's lemma states that T contains a complementary edge - an edge (a 1-simplex) whose vertices are labelled by the same number but with opposite signs.  Proofs  The first proofs were non-constructive, by way of contradiction. Later, constructive proofs were found, which also supplied algorithms for finding the complementary edge. Basically, the algorithms are path-based: they start at a certain point or edge of the triangulation, then go from simplex to simplex according to prescribed rules, until it is not possible to proceed any more. It can be proved that the path must end in a simplex which contains a complementary edge. An easier proof of Tucker's lemma uses the more general Ky Fan lemma, which has a simple algorithmic proof. The following description illustrates the algorithm for n=2. Note that in this case B_n is a disc and there are 4 possible labels: -2, -1, 1, 2, like the figure at the top-right. Start outside the ball and consider the labels of the boundary vertices. Because the labeling is an odd function on the boundary, the boundary must have both positive and negative labels: * If the boundary contains only \\\\pm 1 or only \\\\pm 2, there must be a complementary edge on the boundary. Done. * Otherwise, the boundary must contain (+1,-2) edges. Moreover, the number of (+1,-2) edges on the boundary must be odd. Select an (+1,-2) edge and go through it. There are three cases: * You are now in a (+1,-2,+2) simplex. Done. * You are now in a (+1,-2,-1) simplex. Done. * You are in a simplex with another (+1,-2) edge. Go through it and continue. The last case can take you outside the ball. However, since the number of (+1,-2) edges on the boundary must be odd, there must be a new, unvisited (+1,-2) edge on the boundary. Go through it and continue. This walk must end inside the ball, either in a (+1,-2,+2) or in a (+1,-2,-1) simplex. Done.  Run-time  The run-time of the algorithm described above is polynomial in the triangulation size. This is considered bad, since the triangulations might be very large.

Life Born in Mond√©jar, Guadalajara, Spain, he entered the Society of Jesus at Alcal√° on 27 May 1565. He was rector of the college of Navalcarnero, taught grammar for five years, and in 1579 went to the mission of Mexico, where he was rector of the seminary. Early in 1581 he set out for the Philippines with Bishop Domingo de Salazar. S√°nchez and his companion, Antonio Sedeno, and a lay brother, were the first Jesuits in these islands. The bishop made S√°nchez his counsellor, appointed him to write the acts of the synod of Manila, and, when S√°nchez was sent on an embassy to China, interrupted the synod until S√°nchez had returned. Twice S√°nchez was despatched on official business to China, where he met celebrated Jesuit missionaries of that country and from Japan. He was thus able to publish later an account of the state of Christianity of China at the end of the sixteenth century. By the unanimous vote of all the Spanish officials, civil and religious, of the merchants and other leading citizens, S√°nchez was chosen to go to Madrid as representative of the colony in 1586. S√°nchez's mission to Philip II of Spain was very successful, his arguments moving the king to retain the islands, which many of his advisors had been urging him to abandon. From Madrid he went to Rome, and was there welcomed by Pope Sixtus V, from whom he received many privileges for the Church in the Philippines. In a Brief of 28 June 1591, Pope Gregory XIV praises the apostolic labours and writings of S√°nchez, calling him a true defender of the authority and rights of the Holy See. Pope Innocent IX addressed to him the Bull Inter felices, in which he lauds his work. Pope Clement VIII at his request granted various favours to the bishop and clergy in the islands. S√°nchez gave an account of the Jesuit missions in the Philippines to Aquaviva, the General of the Society. It had been proposed to withdraw the fathers from the Archipelago, but Aquaviva, following the plan proposed by S√°nchez, determined that the Society should remain, and made the Manila residence a college with Sedeno as its first rector. S√°nchez now asked to be allowed to return to the Philippines, but was sent instead as visitor to some of the Spanish provinces of the Society of Jesus, where there were serious domestic and external troubles. The tact of S√°nchez gained the day; he expelled some influential but turbulent members from the Society, and won over the king, the Inquisition, and prominent personages, so that they became better disposed towards the Society. S√°nchez was elected one of the representatives of the Province of Toledo to the Fifth General Congregation of the Society, but he remarked that he had a more important journey to make than the one to Rome. He died twelve days later, at Alcal√° de Henares, on the feast of the Ascension. Works His writings include chiefly short treatises, memorials, and the like. A catalogue and summary of forty-one of these, drawn up by the author, is given by Col√≠n.

Taegyo is said to be regulations that a mother should observe in order to have good effects on her unborn child during maternity. Also, it is the education occurring in the period of maternity and considered that when an expectant mother tries to be careful of everything, prudent in speech and action, and keep distance from evil thoughts, it affects the unborn child in good ways. In other words, Taegyo is all the effort for the mother to provide the best environment for the fetal development. This is based on the belief that fetal environment has a huge influence on the fetal development and the whole life of the baby. Taegyo Information Sign Near Grave Grave of Lee Sajudang Information about Lee Sajudang History Taegyo was introduced into Korea from China at the end of the Goryeo dynasty (918-1392). During the Joseon Dynasty (1392‚Äì1910), it grew in popularity. The Korean scholar Sajudang Lee (ÏÇ¨Ï£ºÎãπ Ïù¥Ïî® Â∏´Êú±Â†ÇÊùéÊ∞è) wrote a book titled Taegyosingi (ÌÉúÍµêÏã†Í∏∞ ËÉéÊïéÊñ∞Ë®ò) in 1800. In his book, Lee asserts that the ten-month education in the mother's womb is more important than the ten-year education that follows it. Proponents of Taegyo claim that its ideas overlap with, but originated significantly earlier in time than the child development theories of the Western world. Taegyo's popularity in Korea has continued into modern times: almost every book for pregnant women in Korea includes a Taegyo section. It is common for modern Korean women to practice Taegyo during pregnancy. Concepts In Taegyo, the embryo is considered to be a person from fertilization. Proponents of Taegyo believe the Oriental way of determining a person's age (which adds 10 months onto the age counted from the day they were born) supports this theory. According to Taegyo theory, as an embryo and fetus, this newly created person is strongly influenced by its emotional environment: the mindset of the pregnant woman. Taegyo is a set of practices claimed to create the best environment for fetal development.EnCyber & EnCyber.com - http://100.naver.com/100.nhn?docid=154473 Practicing Taegyo is largely the responsibility of the woman. Various rule sets have been promoted: the aim of all the rules is to prevent emotional turmoil in the pregnant woman. Proponents of Taegyo point to studies showing the detrimental health effects of stress as supporting their belief that an environment of emotional calm is vitally important to the healthy formation of a child. The most popular rule set is a traditional practice called the seven attitudes. An oral tradition for many years, the seven attitudes were first found in a published book in 1973, in a work by Lee Kyutae (Ïù¥Í∑úÌÉú) in 1973. While the rule sets focus on controlling the woman's behavior, Taegyo holds that the actions and attitude of the husband and father are equally important: the husband is believed to be the person with the greatest influence on the emotional state of his pregnant wife. Common recommendations for the husband are to abstain from smoking and drinking and to maintain a happy and devout mind. Proponents of Taegyo believe that the emotional stability of a pregnant woman has a stronger effect on the health of the fetus than does the woman's physical health. One study they cite found that women with high levels of stress and anxiety during pregnancy had children at increased risk of attention deficit/hyperactivity, anxiety and language delay.University of Edinburgh (2007) Research Symposium Antenatal stress/anxiety, the fetal environment, and the neurodevelopment of the child Another study touted by proponents found that cortisol levels in ten-year-old children showed a relationship to their mother's anxiety level late in pregnancy.BBC NEWS Pregnancy stress 'passed to baby' Tuesday, 27 September 2005 While Taegyo places great importance on avoiding emotional turmoil in a pregnant woman, maintaining a calm mind is considered, in itself, not enough. Different types of Taegyo focus on producing a child with a specific quality. For example, English Taegyo is done with the wish to improve the fetus's language competence. Sound Taegyo, which involves listening to good music, is done to developing the emotional sensitivity and the connection between the mother and child. Practices Talking By nine weeks, a developing fetus can hiccup and react to loud noises. By the end of the second trimester it can hear. Among other mental feats, the fetus can distinguish between the voice of the mother and that of a stranger, and respond to a familiar story read to it. Fetal Psychology Janet L. Hopson Psychology Today, October 1998 Taegyo holds that the best way to stimulate the developing brain of a fetus is to talk to it. The belief is that children who were talked to in the mother's womb are faster language learners, more social, more athletic, and more emotionally sensitive. Talking to the fetus is also believed to increase the strength of the mother-child bond. According to Taegyo, at the time the fetus develops the ability to hear (during the fifth or sixth month of pregnancy), it also begins to feel the same emotions as the pregnant woman. Taegyo practice is to talk to the fetus with the intent of promoting and environment of affection, love, and happiness. Involvement of the woman's husband and other children in the family is believed to increase the beneficial effects on the fetus, as well as bringing the existing family closer together.ÏïÑÏù¥ Î≤†Ïä§Ìä∏ Î≤†Ïù¥ÎπÑ Reading stories Reading children's stories to the fetus is held to aid hearing and emotional development. Reading stories with strong emotional themes, especially, is believed by Taegyo supporters to benefit the emotional development of the fetus. Reading stories is also encouraged because family members who feel awkward just talking to the fetus may be more comfortable reading aloud. In addition, Taegyo recommends having the couple or family discuss the stories after reading them. Playing sounds A recent study of premature infants found that they were soothed by music.Giselle E. Whitwell, R.M.T., The Importance of Prenatal Sound and Music - http://www.birthpsychology.com/lifebefore/sound1.html Music can be used by pregnant women to help them maintain the state of emotional calm demanded by Taegyo. Proponents of Taegyo claim many other benefits of playing calming music for the fetus: stimulation of development of the right side of the brain, development of superior hearing ability, better clarity of thought, emotional stability, hormone secretion, blood pressure, and brain waves. In addition to listening to music, Taegyo recommends that the pregnant woman and her husband sing or play instruments. This is believed to comfort the fetus and encourage healthy deep breathing in the woman.Genau's Blog Taegyo teaches that music originate in the sounds of nature, and exposing the fetus to natural sounds is also held to be important. Recommended sounds include bird song, insect chirps, sea waves, and similar. Doing yoga Yoga reduces stress and so can be very helpful to a woman trying to maintain the calm mind required by Taegyo. Yoga may also provide physical benefits to the pregnant woman, reducing the discomforts of pregnancy and easing childbirth and post- delivery recovery. Taegyo recommends beginning regular yoga practice in the fifth month of pregnancy, and especially recommends the cat and butterfly poses.::: Í±¥Í∞ïÌïú ÏïÑÍ∏∞ ÌñâÎ≥µÌïú Ï∂úÏÇ∞ ÎßòÏöîÍ∞ÄÏûÖÎãàÎã§ :::  References  External links Educating Unborn Children: A S≈èn Master‚Äôs Teachings on T‚Äôaegyo by Daehaeng Sunim, hosted at the Hanmaum Seon Center website See also *Doljanchi *Yoga Category:Korean culture ","title":"Taegyo"},{"id":"17633764","text":"Faroe Islands Premier League Football in the 2006 season. EB/Streymur were top of the league throughout most of the season, with HB T√≥rshavn, B36 T√≥rshavn and NS√ç Runav√≠k staying in contention. With 4 matches left to play, EB/Streymur were 7 points ahead of second placed HB, but after 1 draw and 1 loss for EB/Streymur, HB managed to reduce that lead by 2 points by winning twice. By this time B36, K√ç and NS√ç were out of the title race. With one match left to play, HB T√≥rshavn's only chance of securing the title was if EB/Streymur lost to K√ç Klaksv√≠k. In addition to that, HB had to win their match against √çF. But as both matches were locked in stalemates and time was ebbing out, EB/Streymur were on the way to winning the title. But then, 82 minutes into the match between EB/Streymur and K√ç, events took a dramatic twist, as Paul Clapson put K√ç 1‚Äì0 up against EB/Streymur with a long range effort. But EB/Streymur were still champions at this stage, because HB didn't seem to be able to capitalize on the golden opportunity given by EB/Streymur and K√ç. 88 minutes had gone in the match between HB and √çF, and still HB hadn't scored the crucial goal that would hand them the title. But in a last desperate effort, HB's central defender Vagnur Mohr Mortensen joined the attack. A long high ball was sent into √çF's penalty area on the left where Vagnur headed the ball over a stranded goalkeeper and into the goal for a 1‚Äì0 lead and, more importantly, secured HB the 2006 championship title. Deep into stoppage time, R√≥gvi Jacobsen added another and HB won 2‚Äì0.

Life Poncet was born in Paris in 1610. His father was a member of the Company of One Hundred Associates chartered to trade in New France. Poncet entered the Jesuit novitiate in Paris at nineteen, as a student in rhetoric and philosophy. He pursued his studies at Rouen, and taught at Orl√©ans (1631-4).Zevely, Julia. \\"Joseph Anthony de la Rivi√®re Poncet.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 12.

In 1638 he put her in touch with Madame de la Pettrie. Both accompanied him to New France the following year. Poncet arrived in Quebec in early August 1639 and was immediately sent to the Huron mission, where he spent a year before returning to Quebec, after which he went to Trois-Rivi√®res. In July 1643 he was a parish priest in Montreal.

It is part of the Frankenia genus of the Frankeniaceae family. It can be prostrate or may grow up to 0.5 m in height. Pink or white flowers are produced between June and February in its native range. It occurs in saline flats, salt marshes, or coastal limestone areas.  Taxonomy The specific epithet pauciflora, referring the Latin words paucus, meaning few, and florus meaning flower, referring to the fact that the species produces few flowers.Allen J. Coombes D. Gledhill . Varieties The currently recognised varieties are: *F. p. var. fruticulosa (DC.) Summerh. *F. p. var. gunnii Summerh. *F. p. var. longifolia Summerh. *F. p. var. pauciflora DC. Habitat Frankenia pauciflora is characterized as a halophyte and as such is found to localize in sandy soils, salt floats, salt marshes, and coastal limestones. The plant subsists in environments with a soil class of S2 and S3 which is described as moderately to highly saline soil. The species is a xerophyte, a drought-tolerant plant and survives in environments with sustained predictable dry periods followed by periods of moist soil. Frankenia pauciflora can subsist in a range of soil pHs ranging from acidic to alkaline. In addition, the plant tolerates hot overhead sun to warm low sun and is characterized as is shade tolerant. Distribution The species occurs in Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria, and Tasmania, where it is represented by the variety F. p. var. gunnii which only grows on Flinders, Short, and Harcus Islands. The species is generally considered not threatened, but F. p. var gunnii is considered rare as it only has a small population located in Tasmania that may be at more risk. Var. fruticulosa is found primarily in Southern Australia; var. longifolia is found in Western and Southern Australia, and var. pauciflora is found in only Western Australia. Description Individuals of this species are prostrate perennial shrubs up to 0.5 m in height. It forms many branches that create a thick mat-like structure. It produces fleshy, linear grey-green leaves reaching up to 2 cm, somewhat resembling thyme. The leaves can range for hairless to densely haired. Flowers Its flowers are 2 cm across, stalkless and are generally pink, but sometimes white. The flowers have four to six petals that usually have irregular edges.https://water.wa.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0017/5534/84823.pdf The flowers bloom either solitary at the base of stalks or in bunches of 2‚Äì25 that can be found either at the base or end of stems. Each flower is supported by 4 bracts. The circular pollen has a tricolpate morphology with a reticulated surface pattern. The species in the Frankenia pauciflora is distinguished from other members of its family by the structure of its ovaries. The female flower has a 3-branched style, while the male flower most commonly has six stamens. The ovaries usually have 3 placentae in a basal or parietal configuration. Each placenta is known to contain 2-6 ovules. The fruit is a small brown cylindrical capsule shape.  Leaves  Due to its halophytic properties, Frankenia pauciflora‚Äôs leaves are covered in minuscule salt crystals. These crystals cover the smooth upper surface of the leaf, which range from 2 to 13 mm long and 0.5 to 2.2 mm wide. Small hairs can be seen on most leaves, mainly on the midrib of the lower surface, along with folded over edges. Its leaves generally wilt and turn brown during drought periods. Var gunnii is distinguished in that they have longer, narrower leaves, and inconspicuous mid vein.  Seeds  There is one brown seed per fruit capsule, a cylindrical capsule with 5 or 6 ribbed parts measuring 3-7 mm long. The seeds come attached with a pappus-like structure and separate easily from the fruits. Seeds are sprouted during the months of late January to mid-March.  Bark  Frankenia pauciflora's bark differs from its trunk versus its younger branches. Its new branches have a smoother, and rusty brown appearance while its trunk contains rough and flaky grey to brown bark.  Reproduction  Frankenia pauciflora does not have a set flowering time, flowering throughout the year but particularly between the months of June and February, and can produce seeds at any time during the year. The flowers of Frankenia pauciflora are insect-pollinated to produce dicotyledon seeds. In particular, the flower of F. p. var gunnii are pollinated by insects in the order Diptera, Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera. It has been found that xenogamy in this species leads to more fruits per flower and more seeds in each fruit compared to autogamy; this was reported to be true in both observational studies and controlled experiments.  Uses  The relative simplicity of growth and ability for the plant to adapt to a wide range of soils makes Frankenia Pauciflora an attractive choice for home gardening. Its flame-retardant properties also provide reduced chances of bush-fire spread in risk zones such as Australia when planted surrounding homes. Frankenia pauciflora provides shelter for many faunae as well as being a food source for a number of insects. Its thick network of fine roots are also useful for providing stability in sediments and floodplains.

The current joint-stock company was established through the consolidation of several Samara-based aerospace engine companies, including JSC N.D. Kuznetsov SNTK, JSC Samara Design Bureau of Machine Building and JSC NPO Povolzhskiy AviTI. History The company was established in 1912 as the Gnome Factory of Moscow, after the French aircraft engine company Gnome et Rh√¥ne which supplied the engine parts assembled by the plant. In 1925 it was renamed 'Frunze Factory No. 24', after Bolshevik leader Mikhail Frunze. The factory was evacuated to its current location in Samara in 1941. The Samara Frunze Engine-Building Production Association was one of the principal aerospace engine production complexes in Russia, with six plants and 25,000 employees in the early 1990s. It has produced turbojet and turboprop engines for military and civil use, including Blackjack and Backfire bombers and Tu-154 transports. The NK-12M engine produced by Frunze is the most powerful turboprop in the world. Samara Frunze also produced engines for the Salyut spacecraft and for the Mir space station. Re-established as the joint-stock company Motorostroitel in 1994, it retained this denomination until 2010, when it was merged with several other Samara-based engine plants on the verge of bankruptcy. It then took the name of one of new its subsidiaries, Kuznetsov Design Bureau. Products The current production range of JSC Kuznetsov includes the NK-33 rocket engine, the Kuznetsov NK-32 aviation engine and the NK-37ST industrial engine. In 2016 the company announced plans to produce a modernized version of its NK-32 engine by the end of the year. ; Products The Kuznetzov Bureau first became notable for producing the monstrous Kuznetsov NK-12 turboprop engine that powered the Tupolev Tu-95 bomber beginning in 1952 as a development of the Junkers 0022 engine. The new engine eventually generated about 15,000 horsepower (11.2 megawatts), far more than any Western turboprop engine of its time, and it was also used in the large Antonov An-22 Soviet Air Force transport. Kuznetsov also produced the Kuznetsov NK-8 turbofan engine in the class that powered the Ilyushin Il-62 and Tupolev Tu-154 airliners. This engine was next upgraded to become the about Kuznetsov NK-86 engine that powered the Ilyushin Il-86 aircraft. This Bureau also produced the Kuznetsov NK-144 afterburning turbofan engine. This engine powered the early models of the Tupolev Tu-144 SST. The Kuznetsov Design Bureau also produced the Kuznetsov NK-87 turbofan engine that was used on the Lun-class ekranoplan. (Only one such aircraft has ever been produced.) Kuznetsov's most powerful aviation engine is the Kuznetsov NK-321 that propels the Tupolev Tu-160 bomber and was formerly used in the later models of the Tu-144 supersonic transport (an SST that is now obsolete and no longer flown). The NK-321 produced a maximum of about of thrust.

Rocket engines In 1959, Sergey Korolev ordered a new design of rocket engine from the Kuznetzov Bureau for the Global Rocket 1 (GR-1) Fractional Orbital Bombardment System (FOBS) intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), which was developed but never deployed. The result was the NK-9, one of the first staged-combustion cycle rocket engines. The design was developed by Kuznetsov into the NK-15 and NK-33 engines in the 1960s, and claimed them to be the highest-performance rocket engines ever built, which were to propel the N1 lunar rocket‚Äîone that was never successfully launched.Lindroos, Marcus. THE SOVIET MANNED LUNAR PROGRAM MIT. Accessed: 4 October 2011. As of 2011, the aging NK-33 remains the most efficient (in terms of thrust-to-mass ratio) LOX/Kerosene rocket engine ever created. The Orbital Sciences Antares light-to-medium-lift launcher has two modified NK-33 in its first stage, a solid second stage and a hypergolic orbit stage. The NK-33s are first imported from Russia to the United States and then modified into Aerojet AJ26s, which involves removing some harnessing, adding U.S. electronics, qualifying it for U.S. propellants, and modifying the steering system. The Antares rocket was successfully launched from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility on April 21, 2013. This marked the first successful launch of the NK-33 heritage engines built in early 1970s. Kuznetsov rocket engines include: *Kuznetsov oxygen-rich stage-combustion RP1/LOX rocket engine family. Including NK-9, NK-15, NK-19, NK-21, NK-33, NK-39, NK-43. The original version was designed to power an ICBM. In the 1970s some improved versions were built for the ill-fated Soviet Lunar mission. More than 150 NK-33 engines were produced and stored in a warehouse ever since, with 36 engines having been sold to Aerojet general in the 1990s. Two NK-33 derived engines (Aerojet AJ-26) are used in the first stage of the Antares rocket developed by Orbital Sciences Corporation. The Antares rocket was successfully launched from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility on April 21, 2013. This marked the first successful launch of the NK-33 heritage engines built in the early 1970s. TsSKB-Progress also uses the stockpile NK-33 as the first-stage engine of the lightweight version of the Soyuz rocket family, the Soyuz-2-1v. *RD-107A rocket engine. Powers the boosters of the R-7 family including the Soyuz-FG and Soyuz-2. *RD-108A rocket engine. Powers the core stage of the R-7 family including the Soyuz-FG and Soyuz-2.

He completed the curriculum in 1665 and spent two years more as an instructor at Metz. On his arrival in Canada in June, 1667, he was sent to the mission of Sainte-Marie, which ministered primarily to the Huron people, an Iroquoian- speaking group. In a letter written to friends in France the same year, Oierron described his impressions of the country, the characteristics and customs of the Native Americans, and expressed an admiration for the Iroquoian Huron language, which reminded him of Greek. He arrived at Tionontoguen, one of the three principal villages of the Mohawk Nation, on 7 October 1668, where he replaced Jacques Fr√©min as missionary. These people were one of the most flourishing of the five Iroquois nations: warriors, and difficult to convert. Father Pierron made use of pictures which he painted in order to express his teachings in a way the Mohawk could grasp. He invented a game by means of which the Indians learned the doctrines and devotions of the Church. He taught the children to read and write. Returning north, Pierron spent one winter in Acadia to ascertain whether it would be possible to re-establish the missions, which had been expelled in 1655. He also travelled through New England, Maryland (which at that time had a Catholic governor, Charles Calvert, 3rd Baron Baltimore, and a policy of religious tolerance), and Virginia. Returning to the Iroquois, he worked among them until 1677 and returned to France the following year. References ;Attribution * The entry cites: **Ed.

Nybroviken (Swedish for \\"New Bridge Bay\\") is a small bay in central Stockholm, Sweden. Nybroviken separates the city district √ñstermalm from the peninsula Blasieholmen. North of the bay is Berzelii Park and Norrmalmstorg. To the south Nybroviken connects to the bay Ladug√•rdslandsviken. Facing both these bays are the quays of Strandv√§gen and Nybrokajen. The name stems from the historical bridge Ladug√•rdslandsbron (\\"Barn's Land's Bridge\\"), also known as Nybro, which once stretched across the bay to connect to Nybrogatan. Today, Nybroviken is a frequently used departure point for ferries of various sizes bound for Djurg√•rden and the Stockholm Archipelago.  History  Map showing 14th century (dotted) and 17th century (dashed) shorelines of Nybroviken. Excavated shipwrecks in red. In the 17th century, Nybroviken was still known as Ladug√•rdslandsviken, a name derived from Ladug√•rdslandet, the histocial name of √ñstermalm, at the time a rural area. The bay then was much wider, up to 250 metres, and reached north to present-day Stureplan. Two water courses then emptied into the bay: Tr√§skr√§nnilen (\\"The Swamp Rill\\"), a strait which connected the bay to the historical lake Tr√§sket (\\"The Swamp\\") along the southern part of present-day Birger Jarlsgatan. It was seven metres wide and marked the border between the city districts Norrmalm and √ñstermalm. Archaeological excavations in the 20th century unveiled ships and landing bridges under the present streets -- today located more than 500 metres (1.600 feet) from the waterfront. Both the strait and the lake were made history by land filling around 1880. The second water course was the strait N√§ckstr√∂mmen (\\"The Neck Stream\\") which separated Blasieholmen (at the time an island) from the mainland north of it. In the mid-17th century the strait was 20 metres wide in average and 10 metres at its narrowest. The bridge N√§ckebro stretched across it. Within a century it was consumed by land filling.J√§rbe, pp 19-22. Maps from the 18th century name the innermost part of the bay Packartorgsviken or Packartorgssj√∂n (\\"Packer's Square's Bay/Lake\\") after the precursor of Norrmalmstorg square. Land fillings and garbage gradually transformed it to standing water with the surrounding quays littered with filth. A map from 1780 shows a single usable landing bridge remained in the bay at that time. In 1816, City Architect Carl Christopher Gj√∂rwell was commissioned to redesign the quays of the bay, plans however only partly completed. Packartorgsviken became gradually smaller and swampier, and was colloquially called Katthavet (\\"The Cat Sea\\"), with Katt alluding to something small and false (i.e. a water body of insignificant size).J√§rbe, pp 23-38. Fathomless to today's Stockholmers, Katthavet remained a popular spot for angling and pleasure rowing -- truly an odd hobby as the filthy bay was also used for cleaning clothes. Not even the cholera pandemic of 1834, which caused the death of 4.000 Stockholmers, resulted in any sanitary actions from the city authorities. By the end of that decade, however, the 25th anniversary of King Charles XIV's arrival to Stockholm resulted in plans for a new bridge across the bay. On royal request, the bay north of the bridge was replaced by land filling, and the bridge thus transformed into a quay. The bridge was designed by Fredrik August Lidstr√∂mer, approved by His Majesty in 1837, and works, begun in 1838, were completed in 1849. In 1852 the work to transform the new open space into the present park was begun, and as the statue of J√∂ns Jacob Berzelius was produced by the Academy of Sciences, the park got its present name, Berzelii Park.J√§rbe, pp 39-43. A decision by the city council in 1864 to replace the entire bay with landfills resulted in popular protests led by August Blanche, and in 1867 the council backed out, instead proposing a 395 metres long quay to be built. A statue of John Ericsson by John B√∂rjeson was inaugurated on the quay in 1901. In 1987, part of the quay was renamed in honour of the diplomat Raoul Wallenberg.

He stayed there a short time. The next year he was sent to revive the mission founded by Father Jogues among the Mohawk Nation. On his way, he founded the first Catholic settlement in Vermont, on Isle La Motte. After settling at Tinnontoguen, the Mohawk capital, he acquired the language and won respect. His chief work seems to have been to attend to the Huron captives who were already Christianized. In October 1668, Fr√©min proceeded to the Seneca Indian country. They were engaged in war with the Ottawa and the Susquehannock, which prevented his making much progress or many conversions. In August 1669, he left for Onondaga to preside at a general meeting of the missionary priests. Soon he returned to Tinnontoguen to resume his work among the captive Huron. In 1670, he was recalled to La Prairie, the Christian settlement near Montreal where the converted Indians had been gathered. He improved conditions at the settlement, eliminating the liquor traffic and establishing a regular cycle of prayers. From that time on, with the exception of several voyages to France in the interest of the mission, he devoted himself exclusively to the work of preserving in the Catholic faith those Indians who had been baptized.

She was the leader of Angkatan Wanita Sedar (AWAS), Malaysia's first nationalist women organisation and a prominent Malay leader of the Communist Party of Malaya (CPM). Early life Shamsiah was born in the village of Kampung Gemuruh near the town of Kuala Pilah, Negeri Sembilan. She had her early education in the Madrasah Aliah Islaiah (also known as the Islamic High School) in Pelangai, Negeri Sembilan and was later sent to the Madrasah Tuddimiah in Padang Panjang, Sumatera in what was then the Dutch East Indies. It was during this time that she came under the influence of Lebai Maadah, an influential scholar and Islamic reformer. Family life Shamsiah was married five times from the age of 17. Her first husband, Yasin Kina, abandoned her while she was pregnant with their second child and both children died in their infancy. Her second husband, J. M. Rusdi, was eventually discovered to be an informer for the Japanese forces then occupying Malaya. She was also briefly married to Ahmad Boestamam, the leader of PKMM's youth wing, Angkatan Pemuda Insaf (Awakened Youth Organisation; API). In her memoirs, she claimed that her marriage with Boestamam broke down due to her disagreement with the latter's decision to pay a fine to avoid a jail sentence for publishing a book deemed seditious by government in 1947. Notably the marriage was never mentioned in any of Boestamam's memoirs and writings. Her fourth husband, Wahi Anuwar, was a fellow CPM member who was captured by British and imprisoned. Shamsiah was told that he had surrendered and thought he was dead. He was, in fact, imprisoned for 15 years and eventually died in 1980. Her final marriage was to another CPM member, Ibrahim Mohamad, in 1956. They remained married until his death in 2006. Political activism Early involvement As a fiery orator, Shamsiah was scouted by both the United Malays National Organisation and the Malay Nationalist Party (, PKMM), the main Malay political parties in the post-war period. She eventually chose to join PKMM because she believed it was more dedicated to the struggle for Malaya's independence whereas she considered UMNO a puppet of the British. In 1946, she was asked to lead PKMM's women's wing, Angkatan Wanita Sedar (Cohort of Awakened Women; AWAS). Armed struggle With the banning of the PKMM, API and AWAS in 1948 prior to the declaration of the Malayan Emergency followed by the mass arrests of left leaning Malay nationalists, Shamsiah retreated to the jungles and joined the predominantly Malay 10th Regiment of the Malayan People's Liberation Army of the CPM operating from Lubok Kawah near Temerloh, Pahang. When the 10th Regiment was forced to retreat together with the 11th and 12th Regiment to the Thai-Malaya border in 1953 after a series of military defeats beginning with the Battle of Padang Piul in 1949, Shamsiah joined the retreat and continued to fight as a guerilla until she was sent to the China for further education together with her husband, Ibrahim Mohamad, in 1956. Exile The couple remained in China and served as broadcasters with Radio Peking's Malay language service airing propaganda broadcasts via shortwave to Malaya. In 1965, they were assigned by the party to Indonesia to set up a legation office of the Malayan National Liberation League. Their stint was, however, short lived as they were arrested later that year due to the anti-communist purges in Indonesia in the aftermath of the 30 September Movement. They remained imprisoned until 1967 when they obtained their freedom through the mediation of the embassy of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and obtained passage via Vietnam back to China. As a result of faction politics within the CPM and the chaos that resulted from the Cultural Revolution in China during the period, Shamsiah and her husband became increasingly estranged from the party's Secretary General, Chin Peng. Both Shamsiah and her husband were expelled from the party in 1972. As they were unable to return to Malaysia (established in 1963 with the federation of Malaya, Singapore, British North Borneo, and Sarawak), they settled in the town of Xiangtan, Hunan and were assigned to work in a steel factory. She also served as a Malay language consultant with Radio Beijing and the Beijing Foreign Languages Institute. Return to Malaysia Shamsiah and her family applied to the Malaysian government for permission to return to the country from 1985 onwards. Following the terms of the 1989 peace agreement signed between the CPM and the Government of Malaysia in Haadyai, Thailand, permission was finally granted on 23 July 1994 and Shamsiah returned along with her husband, their three sons and their four grandchildren. Upon their arrival, the family was met by Special Branch officers who took them to a resort and for about 10 days, they were debriefed and briefed on the local customs and political scenario in Malaysia. One of the conditions for the family's return was a bar on participation in politics and for the first few years upon their return, Shamsiah was not even allowed to participate in academic speaking engagements. Her Chinese daughters-in-law were initially barred entry into the country but were eventually granted permanent residency. Her memoirs were first published in 2004 by Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) but was immediately suppressed by the authorities and withdrawn from circulation. A new edition as well as a Chinese language translation was published in 2007 by the Strategic Information and Research Development Centre (SIRD) which saw UKM reintroduce their edition into the market. Death Following a stroke in 1999, Shamsiah had generally been in poor health and was bedridden by 2007. She died on 20 October 2008 at the residence of her son, Jamaluddin Ibrahim (father of Jamaliah Jamaluddin), due to respiratory failure and was buried at the Sungai Besi Muslim cemetery at 5.30pm of the same day. Present at the funeral were some prominent politicians including the deputy president of Parti Keadilan Rakyat, Syed Husin Ali, and Democratic Action Party Member of Parliament, Tony Pua. Controversies In 1981, the defected chairman of the CPM, Musa Ahmad, claimed that Shamsiah had committed infanticide by killing her third child while in the jungle to avoid capture. She subsequently denied the allegation in her memoirs and explained that she was convinced by fellow guerillas to give the child away to local villagers to be raised upon entering an unfamiliar district. It was only later that she discovered that the child had in fact been killed. The Japanese was raiding the whole village in an attempt to find her child, and threatened to behead everyone in the village if the child is found hidden by one of the villagers. There was no way to hide the crying child, so it was killed by one of the villagers by drowning, and the Japanese never found it.

He worked as a pioneer missionary in the north-west of the United States to the Flathead Nation, and became the philologist of their languages. Life Born in Rome, he entered the Jesuit novitiate in 1828, and later served as instructor in grammar, for which his philological bent particularly fitted him, at Rome, Modena and Reggio Emilia. While studying at the Collegio Romano in 1839, a letter of Joseph Rosati, Bishop of St. Louis, voicing the appeal of the Flatheads for missionary priests, was read out in the refectory, during the meal, and Mengarini felt moved to volunteer for the work. Ordained priest in March 1840, he sailed with Father Cotling, another volunteer, from Livorno on 23 July, and after a nine weeks' voyage landed at Philadelphia. From Baltimore the missionaries found their way to the University of Georgetown, District of Columbia, and a little later to St. Louis, where it was decided Cotling should remain. Mengarini was chosen for the mission of the upper Missouri, partly on account of his voice and knowledge of music ‚Äì valued in Indian mission work. On 24 April 1841, Father de Smet, Mengarini, and Nicolas Point, with the lay brothers Specht, Huett, and Classens, and nine other companions, began the long journey by river and overland trail to Fort Hall, Idaho, then a trading post, where they arrived on the feast of the Assumption (15 August) and found a party of Flatheads waiting to conduct them to their final destination. It was nearly a month later when they arrived at the chosen site on St. Mary's River, Montana, in the Flathead country, and began the foundations of the log mission. The missionaries worked at cutting the frozen earth with axes. The church and house were of logs plastered between with clay, and were thatched with weeds, the rooms being partitioned with curtains of deerskin and thin scraped deerskin being used in lieu of glass for the windows. The winter cold was so intense that the buffalo skin robes in which they wrapped themselves at night were frozen stiff and had to be thawed out each morning. The missionaries began the study of the language, translating into it simple prayers and hymns. Mengarini composed a Salish grammar which is still the standard for the cognate dialects. He taught the children to sing in Salish hymns of his own composition, and even trained an Indian band for service on feast days. The work progressed until 1849, when in consequence of the inroads of the Blackfeet and the defection and relapse of a large part of the Flathead tribe under a rival claimant for the chieftainship it was decided to close the mission. Mengarini was summoned to join Father Accolti, the superior of the north-western Jesuit Missions, in Oregon. About a year later, on request of Archbishop Alemany of San Francisco for Jesuit workers, he was sent to aid in establishing at Santa Clara the Californian mission which was the nucleus of the present college. In the meantime the Flatheads had sent to Oregon to ask for his return. They were told this was impossible as he was assigned to another station, but on their urgent desire, the Flathead mission was re- established at St. Ignatius in 1851. Mengarini was stationed at Santa Clara for the rest of his life, acting for thirty years as treasurer or vice- president, until a stroke of apoplexy and failing sight caused his retirement from active duties. A third stroke of apoplexy ended his life in his seventy- sixth year.  Contribution to philology  Mengarini's principal contribution to philology is his Selish or Flathead Grammar: Grammatica lingu√¶ Selic√¶ ‚Äì published by the Cromoisy Press (New York, 1861) from the third manuscript copy, the first two, laboriously written out by him, having been lost. Originally intended solely for the use of the missionaries, it was written in Latin, and he himself always said the first draft was the most correct. He also furnished vocabularies of the cognate Salishan languages ‚Äì of Shw oyelpi (Colville), S'chitzui (Coeur d'Alene) and Salish proper (Flathead) in John Wesley Powell's Contributions to North American Ethnology, I (Washington, 1877), and of the Santa Clara dialect of California in Stephen Powers's Tribes of California, volume III of the same series, published in the same year. He contributed some linguistic notes in the Journal of the Anthropological Institute of New York, I (1871‚Äì72). His personal memoir, The Rocky Mountains, published in the Woodstock Letters for 1888, was dictated a few months before his death.

It was designed for use on the Space Shuttle orbiter as part of its thermal protection system to minimize thermal conductivity while providing maximum thermal shock resistance. Statistics LI-900 has a bulk density of 144.2 kg/m¬≥ (9 lb/ft¬≥). It was for this reason that it was called the LI-900. It is made from 99.9% pure silica glass fibres, and is 94% air by volume. An LI-900 tile can be heated to and then immediately plunged into cold water and suffer no damage. Black and white tiles were used on the Space Shuttle to control the temperature of the vehicle while in orbit. * White tiles (known as LRSI) were used mainly on the upper surface and have higher thermal reflectivity. These are therefore pointed towards the sun in order to minimize solar gain. * Black tiles (known as HRSI) are optimized for maximum emissivity, which means they lose heat faster than white tiles. This property is required in order to maximise heat rejection during re-entry. There are typically 20,000 HRSI LI-900 tiles on a Space Shuttle, and 725 LRSI LI-900 tiles. Problems Atlantis Strength As a result of optimizing its thermal properties, overall strength was reduced. The tile was therefore not suitable to be used in high-stress areas such as around the landing gear doors and windows. To solve this, a higher strength version of the LI-900 material was produced, with a bulk density of 352.4 kg/m¬≥ (22 lbs/ft¬≥), which was called the LI-2200. This tile provided the strength and insulating properties, but with a considerable weight penalty. Damage reduction A research and development program was started to establish a means for substantially improving the damage resistance and micrometeorite orbital debris (MMOD) characteristics of the LI-900 shuttle baseline tile. This would result in a greatly reduced amount of damage and therefore less repair between flights. A short term solution was found by developing a new surface treatment for the tile, which took advantage of the Ames technology previously developed, and designated TUFI. A prototype of this material was produced successfully, its damage resistance was determined, and its microstructural stability was demonstrated. A longer term solution used AETB-8 as the insulation substrate. This substrate is significantly stronger than the LI-900 substrate, and is more compatible with the TUFI surface treatment.

The film, starring Haley Bennett, Chace Crawford, AnnaLynne McCord, and Jake Weber,Review: The Haunting of Molly Hartley was a critical failure but a mild commercial success. Plot The film begins with a teenage girl, Laurel Miller (Jessica Lowndes), going into the woods to meet her boyfriend Michael (Randy Wayne). He gives her an early birthday present, but her father (Jamie McShane) shows up and demands that she leave with him. As they drive home, Laurel tells him that she will be marrying Michael as soon as she turns eighteen. He breaks down and apologizes to her, telling her he can't let her turn 18, then purposely crashes their car. Seeing that she is not dead, he kills her with a broken piece of mirror, saying he couldn't let the darkness take her. The film then switches to present day where 17-year-old Molly Hartley (Haley Bennett) is stabbed in the chest by her deranged mother Jane (Marin Hinkle) with a pair of scissors one day after school. Although she survives and her wound is healed with only a scar remaining, she is still haunted in her dreams and hears things because of the frightening experience. Molly lives with her father Robert (Jake Weber), and her mother is locked up in a mental ward outside the town she recently moved to. Her father enrolls Molly in a new school to help with the trauma and start a new life. However, as her eighteenth birthday approaches, Molly must deal with both the stress of being a new student and with the continuing nightmares she has of her mother's attack. Joseph Young (Chace Crawford), one of Molly's classmates, attempts to help her; however, Molly begins to display symptoms of the same psychosis that took control of her mother's life. Molly then attends a party at Joseph's house, where his jealous ex-girlfriend tries to attack her. She breaks the girl's arm and then leaves the party on foot, due to being refused a ride home by one of her new friends. Then she has another hallucination of Jane attacking her and after escaping her has a panic attack. The next morning she apologizes to Joseph's ex, who tells Molly she knows what Molly is. Molly doesn't understand, and responds, \\"what am I? What am I?\\" Joseph catches up to her in the hall, and she tells him to leave her alone. Molly later runs into Alexis, who offers salvation which Molly declines. Afterwards she arrives home where she is cornered by Jane and discovers that she, and others who share her mother's concerns, want to kill her in order to save her from a preordained life as a servant to Satan. It is revealed that Molly had died as the result of a miscarriage and her parents made a pact with the Devil, who was disguised as a woman, to save her life. The terms of the agreement were such that the Hartleys would only have Molly until her eighteenth birthday, then she would belong to the Devil. After Jane is accidentally killed, and upon knocking her father out, Molly runs to seek salvation by accepting a baptism by Alexis, who later tries to drown her after stating she knows what Molly is. Then Alexis accidentally is knocked on her head which kills her and Molly turns to Joseph for help only to discover that he is one of them and has set her up by taking her to his house. Dr. Emerson (Nina Siemaszko) arrives at Joseph's house and tells Molly that she is also to be a servant of the devil. She says Molly can either kill her father to break the pact, or submit to the Devil. She tries to let her father live and avoid her fate by attempting suicide with a kitchen knife. This attempt is in vain because the clock has already struck midnight. The film switches to a mental institution, where a doctor is talking to a woman dressed in black, later revealed to be a cold-hearted Molly. It is revealed that Molly's father has now been admitted to the institution; Molly casually smiles and says she will not speak to him, instead choosing to move on. Molly becomes valedictorian of her high school, and dates Joseph. She is seen leaving her high school graduation with Joseph in a limousine, after being told by Dr. Emerson (disguised as the school guidance counselor) that they'll \\"see her soon.\\" Cast * Haley Bennett as Molly Hartley * Jake Weber as Robert Hartley * Chace Crawford as Joseph Young * Shannon Woodward as Leah * Shanna Collins as Alexis White * AnnaLynne McCord as Suzie Woods * Marin Hinkle as Jane Hartley * Nina Siemaszko as Dr. Amelia Emerson * Josh Stewart as Mr. Draper * Jessica Lowndes as Laurel Miller * Randy Wayne as Michael * Jamie McShane as Mr. Miller * Ron Canada as Mr. Bennett * Kevin Cooney as Dr. Donaldson * Ross Thomas as Jock * Charles Chun as Doctor * John Newton as Mr. Young Release Box office The Haunting of Molly Hartley opened theatrically on October 31, 2008, in 2,652 venues, earning $5,423,315 in its opening weekend, ranking number five and second among the weekend's new releases.

It is located 5 miles (8 km) west of Kyrenia, thus the name.Savvas D. Vlassis, O Aporritos Attilas, Athens 2004 For 3 days (20‚Äì22 July 1974), heavy fighting took place around the beachhead between Turkish and Greek Cypriot forces. 20 July  The landing  Monuments The Turkish task force set sail from Mersin port at 11.30 on 19 July. At about 05.00 on 20 July the fleet reached the northern coast of Cyprus. It initially missed the designated beach of Pentemili, and approached the unsuitable rocky beach of Glykiotissa, 3 km west of Kyrenia. The planned time for the beginning of the disembarkation was 05.30, but because of this mistake, the landing of the first crafts took place at 07.15. The landing finished at about 13.00. The landed force was the \\"√áakmak\\" (Tsakmak) one infantry marine brigade, consisting of 4 battalions with a nominal strength of 3,500 men, 12 M101 howitzers (105mm calibre) and 20 M113 armored personnel carriers. The task force also carried 15 M47 Patton tanks on the decks of the LST Ertugrul (L401), but those were unable to disembark, as the small size of the beach didn't allow the Ertugrul to approach. One unit of company size was also transported with helicopters to the hills south of the road. A total of roughly 3,000 men was unloaded on the Pentemili beachhead that day. Two Cypriot torpedo boats were sent to intercept the approaching Turkish flotilla, but were destroyed by Turkish air support. The landing itself occurred under no fire, as there were no units of the Cypriot National Guard in the area. The objective of the landed forces was the port town of Kyrenia, some 8 km to the east of the beach. The Turkish forces, immediately after landing began expanding the beachhead, to give it a safe depth. Greek-Cypriot resistance on the initial landing The event of a such landing was predicted in the Cypriot National Guard's \\"Aphroditi 1973\\" plan. Realization of this plan was thus ordered by the National Guard High Command (GEEF) at 07.00. The unit closest to the beach was the active 251st infantry battalion under Lt. Colonel Pavlos Kouroupis. The 1st company and the support company took position opposing the Turkish beachhead at about 09.30,Kostas Hatziantoniou, Kypros 1954-1974, Athens 2007 while the 2nd and 3rd companies retained their positions against the Turkish Cypriot village of Templos. The 251st battalion was aided by a tank platoon of 5 T-34/85 tanks, of the 23rd tank battalion (based in Nicosia). The 1st company took positions immediately to the east of the Turkish beachhead, while the support company was positioned southwest of the beachhead, at the location Pikro Nero.Georgios Sergis, The battle of Cyprus: July‚ÄìAugust 1974, Second Edition (improved), Athens 1999, At 10.00 the battalion was ordered to attack the beachhead. The numerical imbalance forbade any serious success, however the attack seems to have initially surprised the Turkish units and caused some casualties, but they were quickly able to answer the fire, and stop any further Greek advance. Thus, the beachhead was limited to about 300m south of the road, and 1-1.5 km east of the landing beach. With the initiation of the fire exchange, a number of National Guard's artillery batteries began sporadic and generally inaccurate fire. Since these artillery units had no orders, some of them did not act at all, and those that did, did so under their commanders' responsibility. At about 12.00 the Turkish forces attempted an advance to the east against the 251st bn, with support from their M113 APCs. The attack was repelled and two M113 were destroyed by the T-34/85, but the 251st bn had to give some ground retreating to the east. On the western side of the beachhead, the Turkish forces advanced to about 1 km, facing no resistance, and they stopped, as their objective lied to the east. Mobilisation of the National Guard Two Greek-Cypriot reserve battalions were seated in the area, the 326th in Kyrenia and the 306th in Agios Georgios. The 326th didn't mobilize at all, as its weapons were stored north of Karavas, across the Turkish beachhead, while the 306th did so, albeit very slowly, and with reduced strength. The National Guard High Command sent as reinforcements two battalions from Nicosia. Because the road from Nicosia to Kerynia was under the control of the Turkish Cypriot G√∂nyeli enclave, these units had to follow a longer route via the Panagra pass, west of the beachhead. These units were the 281st bn, minus a company, with the task of securing the Panagra pass, and the 286th mechanised infantry battalion, reinforced with 3 T-34/85, with the order of reaching the village Karavas, on the western flank of the Turkish beachhead. Both units were attacked by the Turkish Air Force while passing through the village Kontemenos, and suffered heavy casualties, including 6 BTR-152V1 APCs and the commander of the 286th, who died of his wounds later. As a result both units had a morale collapse, and both were ordered to simply move to Panagra pass securing it and regrouping. Later in the afternoon, one company sized unit from the 286th bn, including the 3 tanks and an AT platoon (equipped with M40 recoilless rifles, calibre 106mm), was ordered to continue the advance. The remaining 281st bn was also later ordered to participate in a planned night attack. The 316th reserve battalion from Morphou (west of the beachhead) was ordered to send the first two companies to be mobilized to Kyrenia, without knowing of the Turkish beachhead. As a result, at about 13.00 its 1st company was ambushed by Turkish forces, and suffered losses, including its commander. Realizing that the road to Kyrenia was cut, the battalion assumed defensive positions. At 16.30 the units from the 286th battalion arrived and united with the 316th. One T-34/85 was hit by Turkish AT fire, during a skirmish. At about 20.00 a staff officer, of the National Guard High command, Lt. Colonel Konstantinos Boufas, arrived on the western sector, trying to coordinate the actions. At 21.00 the 281st bn (still at Panagra pass) was ordered to reinforce the units on the western flank of the beachhead. It arrived at about 23.00. The reduced 281st, the two companies of the 316th, the company of the 286th and the AT and tank platoons, in total size, a reinforced battalion, was named \\"Boufas' battlegroup\\". A night attack was planned. The night attack The Greek-Cypriot counter attack was planned to begin at 02.30, with no artillery support. At 02.15 the commander of 316th bn was seriously wounded by Turkish mortar fire. Units' positions early on the 21st's morning The Greek-Cypriot attack on the west commenced only with mortar support. It was carried out mostly by the 286th bn, which attacked on foot in a wedge formation, supported by machinegun fire by its BTR-152 vehicles. After overrunning the first Turkish lines and advancing in a depth of 500m, the attack stopped, under the heavy fire of the Turkish units, that had organised their defensive positions during the day. At its right flank, the 281st bn failed to overrun the first Turkish lines. The 316th bn remained in reserve. In order to avoid the action of the Turkish Air Force after dawn, the attacking units folded back to their starting positions. On the eastern flank, the reserve 306th bn had not arrived yet. The 1st company of the 251st bn was ordered to attack, but under the dense Turkish fire it soon retreated to its initial position. The 306th arrived later and commenced its own attack, which did not succeed. On the southern flank, a reserve battalion, which was created by surplus reservists (attendance of reservists in Nicosia was bigger than expected) called \\"Pantazis battalion\\" (after the name of its commander), arrived with no information of the enemy's location. At some point during the night, as it was marching northwards, its men realized that the battalion had entered the Turkish lines. After an exchange of fire, with no serious casualties, the battalion managed to exit the Turkish ambush, and assume defensive positions. The battalion lost a total of some 7-10 men killed and wounded, including its commander, who got shot in the arm. During the rest of the night, many of its reservists leaked southwards, back to Nicosia. The battalion eventually disbanded. =Colonel Karaoglanoglu's death= At about 03:00, the Turkish Colonel Karaoglanoglu, commander of the 50th infantry regiment of the Turkish army was killed in a villa, some 300m east of the Pentemili beach. The reason of his death officially was Greek mortar or artillery fire. According however to General Bedrettin Demirel's memoirs, the projectiles (two were fired), were 3.5 inch rockets, apparently from a M20 Super Bazooka. The holes that the projectile made, vertically on a vertical wall, and Demirel's implies about \\"fire discipline\\", point to the incident being a case of friendly fire. Additionally, the maximum range of a M20 Super Bazooka is ~300m, which, judging from the direction from which the projectile came, means that it was fired from within the Turkish beachhead. 21 July On 21 July little happened around the Pentemili beachhead. The Turkish forces took some limited ground on the east during the noon. On the southern flank, where no Greek units existed, the Turkish forces advanced 500m to the roots of Pentadaktylos mountains, but stopped due to the raging fires that were burning after the bombardment of the area by the Turkish air force. Away from Pentemili, in Mersin port, a second wave of Turkish forces was being prepared. It consisted mainly of a tank company (17 tanks) of the 39th divisional tank battalion and a mechanized infantry company of the 49th regiment with M113 APCs. It left Mersin at 13.30 on 21 July 1974, its destination was Pentemili. The second wave was named \\"Task force Bora\\". 22 July Arrival of the second wave of Turkish forces Task force Bora arrived at Pentemili beach at 09.00. Major General Bedrettin Demirel, commander of the 39th Infantry Division, had appointed Brigadier Hakki Boratas commander of Bora task force, while he assumed command of all the Turkish forces in the beachhead. At arrival, Demirel, who knew of the cease-fire agreement, which would start at 17.00, sought to begin the attack against Kyrenia immediately. He noticed that the Turkish troops of the first wave were in poor shape and had low morale, being sleepless and disorganised, he however insisted that the attack start as soon as possible. The attack, led by Bora task force followed by the 50th regiment, began at 11.00. Changes on the Greek-Cypriot side On the Greek-Cypriot side, the National Guard's High Command had noticed the inability of the 3rd Tactical Group (responsible for Kyrenia sector) to coordinate its forces and eliminate the Turkish beachhead, and gave the command of all Greek forces west and east of the beachhead to Colonel Kobokis (commander of the Greek-Cypriot Special Forces). Kobokis planned for the 33rd commando battalion (reduced)to arrive as reinforcemtns. Additionally, a company of the 346th infantry battalion, mounted on improvised APCs (modified tracked artillery tractors, ATS-712) and a platoon with 4 3M6 (AT-1 Snapper) elements of the independent 120th weapons company were sent as reinforcements. Between the night attack of 20‚Äì21 July and the morning of 22 July most of 306th battalion's men had retreated to Kerynia exposing the flank of the 251st bn. At 09.00 the lightly equipped 33rd commando battalion (two companies with fewer than 150 men) arrived at the Agios Georgios village, where the 306th was supposed to be. The attack on Kyrenia At 11.00 the Turkish attack to the east, towards Kyrenia, began. The weight of the Turkish attack fell on the 33rd commando. after a brief fight, in which two Turkish M47 tanks were destroyed, the Greek line broke at about 11.30. The 33rd commando was ordered to disband and retreat in groups to Kyrenia. The elements of 251st and 306th battalions on the flank of the Turkish advance, had no ability to change the outcome of the battle, also retreated to Kyrenia. After pleads from Kobokis towards the commander of the 241st bn (stationed east of Kyrenia), elements of the 241st bn rushed to Kyrenia, trying to mount a defence line. Left of the 241st bn, some of the 306th bn's soldiers (reservists) took positions, while the rest gathered in the local football pitch. An additional 3 Turkish M47s were destroyed, but eventually the position of the 241st bn was overrun, while the commander of the 306th bn was captured. Clearing the town from remaining Greek pockets took many hours, until the morning of 23 July. During the attack, the commander of Bora force, Hakki Boratas, suffered a deep wound on his leg. The Turkish commander Mj. Gen. Demirel, after leaving about half the Turkish force in Kyrenia to clear the town of Greek forces, ordered the rest of the force southwards to the direction of Bogaz, in order to unite the beachhead with G√∂nyeli enclave. At about 17.30 the armoured elements of Bora force united with the Turkish Cypriots and the Turkish paratroopers at Bogaz. At 18.00 Demirel met with 6th Corps' commander, Lt. General Nurettin Ersin, who had been paradropped into G√∂nyeli enclave. Fighting continued after the cease fire, both in the town of Kyrenia and around the beachhead.

A self-styled doctor, he was best known for his electro-magnetic musical Grand State Celestial Bed. Dismissed as a quack by medical experts, Graham apparently believed in the efficacy of his unusual treatments.Fishbein, Morris. (1932). Fads and Quackery in Healing: An Analysis of the Foibles of the Healing Cults. New York: Covici Friede. pp. 5-6Whitwell, W. L. (1977). James Graham, Master Quack. Journal of Eighteenth Century Life 4: 43-49. Historian Roy Porter writing in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography states that Graham's sexological views were quite typical of the period. John Kay Early life James Graham, son of a saddler, was born on 23 June 1745 in Edinburgh, where he trained in medicine, but left medical school without taking a degree. Probably with the help of William Buchan, future author of the best-seller Domestic Medicine, Graham set up as an apothecary in Doncaster, Yorkshire, and in 1764 he married Mary Pickering of Ackworth. They had three children, of whom a son, James, a diplomat, and a daughter survived their father. In 1770 Graham left England for America, travelling around the middle colonies as an oculist and aurist before settling in Philadelphia. He placed prosthetic eyes and performed cataract surgery. Here he learned the principles of electricity from Ebenezer Kinnersley, Benjamin Franklin's friend and collaborator, and he later wrote that it was in Philadelphia that he began to develop the prototype of his Celestial Bed. Leaving America around the time of the first rumblings of the American Revolution, he worked briefly in Bristol and then Bath before setting up practice in London, where Horace Walpole consulted him about his gout. After travelling in Holland, Germany and Russia in 1776, Graham set up practice in Bath, Somerset. Advertisements promoting cures using \\"Effluvia, Vapours and Applications √¶therial, magnetic or electric\\" attracted his first celebrity patient, the historian Catharine Macaulay. She became the subject of scandal in 1778 when she married James Graham‚Äôs 21-year-old brother William, who was less than half her age. Temple of Health Graham with some of his patients. During a research tour of Europe in the summer of 1779, Graham acquired a new patron in Lady Spencer, mother of Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire. In May 1780, Graham opened his first Temple of Health, housed in the centre of the Adam brothers' speculative development at the Adelphi. Here he displayed elaborate electro-magnetic apparatus, treated patients with musical therapy and pneumatic chemistry as well as electricity and magnetism, published marriage guidance material, gave medical lectures and sold medicines such as \\"Electrical Aether\\" and \\"Nervous Aetherial Balsam.\\" He performed with the help of a succession of Goddesses of Health, displayed as models of physical perfection. A later rumour stated that the young Emma Hamilton (then known as Emy Lyon), was employed as the goddess Hebe Vestina. His gigantic porters were nicknamed Gog and Magog, after the Guildhall Giants. The Temple of Health was a success and Graham became the talk of London, featuring in satirical plays, poems, prints and newspaper skits. During the 1780s he was publicly associated with society figures. The Celestial Bed In June 1781 Graham launched the Temple of Hymen in new premises at Schomberg House, in Pall Mall, designed to house the newly built Celestial Bed. His \\"wonder- working edifice\\" was , and canopied by a dome covered in musical automata, fresh flowers, and a pair of live turtle doves. Stimulating oriental fragrances and \\"aethereal\\" gases were released from a reservoir inside the dome. A tilting inner frame put couples in the best position to conceive, and their movements set off music from organ pipes which breathed out \\"celestial sounds\\", whose intensity increased with the ardour of the bed's occupants. The electrified, magnetic creation was insulated by 40 glass pillars. At the head of the bed, above a moving clockwork tableau celebrating Hymen, the god of marriage, and sparkling with electricity, were the words: > \\"Be fruitful, multiply and replenish the earth!\\"Davenport, John. > Aphrodisiacs and Love Stimulants. Kessinger Publishing, 2003. p. 59 At Schomberg House, Graham gave his Lecture on Generation, a frank explanation of how to conceive which saw sex as a patriotic act and procreation as a national duty. Cold water washing of the genitals was recommended as essential to good sexual health, and prostitution and masturbation were castigated. Graham gave more discreet marriage guidance in a pamphlet called \\"A Private Advice.\\" Graham was soon in financial difficulties. He vacated the Adelphi Temple of Health in July 1781, and concentrated on trying to recoup his costs at Schomberg House. By March 1784 he was forced to sell most of his possessions. He returned to Edinburgh, to display the remains of his apparatus in a temporary Temple of Health on South Bridge Street. Last years Graham developed from the 1770s another therapy, which he called \\"earth-bathing\\" in a 1790 pamphlet. In 1786, he gave public exhibitions of earth-bathing in Panton Street in London, and lectured buried up to the neck in earth. From the mid-1780s Graham preached, and opposed the religious views of Joseph Priestley. At times he was confined to his house as a lunatic. At the end of 1792, Graham began to experiment with extended fasting to prolong his life. He died at his home in Edinburgh in 1794. Publications Graham published his first medical tract in 1775, and continued to promote his ideas in print throughout his life. His publications were distinguished by their flowery and hyperbolical rhetoric, and their humane and progressive views on war, slavery, women‚Äôs education, farming, religious tolerance and diet (he was a passionate vegetarian).

The purpose of SOE was to conduct espionage, sabotage and reconnaissance in occupied Europe against the Axis powers. SOE agents allied themselves with French Resistance groups and supplied them with weapons and equipment parachuted in from England. Vom√©court founded and headed SOE's first Resistance network (also called circuit) in occupied France. His AUTOGIRO network operated in and around Paris from May 1941 to April 1942. He was captured by the Germans in April 1942. After nearly a year of mostly solitary confinement in Fresnes Prison near Paris, he spent the rest of the war imprisoned in Nazi Germany in Colditz Castle, a POW camp for military officers. He was freed by the allied armies in April 1945. In the estimation of the official historian of SOE, M.R.D. Foot, Vomecourt was SOE's \\"first important agent in France.\\"Introduction by M. R. D.

(1966), SOE in France, London: Her Majesty's Stationery Office, pp. 163‚Äì164, 190 Early life The Vomƒócourt's were an aristocratic family from Lorraine, on the border with Germany. Pierre's great-grandfather was killed in the War of 1870 with Germany and his father was killed in 1914 in World War I. He had two older brothers, Jean and Philippe, both of whom also worked in the French Resistance. Pierre was educated at Beaumont College in Old Windsor, England.Vom√©court, Philippe de (2016), An Army of Amateurs, Pickle Partners Publishing. Kindle, Location 181‚Äì220. Originally published in 1961. Vom√©court was married to Micheline Sally, and had two daughters.\\"Pierre de Crevoisier de Vom√©court,\\" , accessed 20 January 2020 Vom√©court was \\"a vigorous, talkative, good-looking man in his middle thirties, a good shot, a fast thinker, full of energy and enthusiasm.\\"Foot, p. 163 World War II At the beginning of World War II in 1939, Vom√©court joined the French army and became a liaison officer and interpreter with the Scottish Rifles. He was evacuated with British forces from Dunkirk in June 1940. His family remained in France, living in Paris. In London, he tried unsuccessfully to interest the Free French Forces of Charles de Gaulle in supporting his plans for resistance to the German occupation of France. He then met the leaders of SOE, and was recruited into their F (French) section for training, with the codename of Lucas.Vom√©court, Location 181‚Äì220 SOE On the night of 10/11 May 1941 Vom√©court was parachuted into France near Chateauroux with Roger Cottin, the second and third SOE agents to enter France. He was met by his radio operator, Georges B√©gu√©, who had parachuted into France a few days earlier. Pierre recruited his brothers to work in the Resistance and the three Vom√©court brothers met at Philippe's estate near Limoges and divided up resistance zones among themselves. Jean chose to work in eastern France, based in Pontarlier; Philippe chose Limoges as his base; and Pierre along with Cottin and B√©gu√© would work in the north and set up a resistance network, called AUTOGIRO, based in Paris.\\"Pierre de Vom√©court,\\" Musee de la Resistance,\\" , accessed 20 January 2020. On 13 June 1941, SOE airdropped two CLE Canisters onto Bas Soleil, Philippe de Vom√©court's estate east of Limoges, France. The canisters were dropped by an Armstrong Whitworth Whitley bomber and contained sub- machine guns, explosives, and other materials. Pierre and wireless operator B√©gu√© arranged for the airdrop. These canisters were the first of nearly 60,000 canisters loaded with supplies and arms which SOE air-dropped to agents and resistance groups during World War II.Foot, pp. 163‚Äì164 Pierre and the Cat Vom√©court's wireless operator Georges B√©gu√© was arrested in October 1941 and his replacement, Andr√© Bloch, was arrested by the Germans in November. Vom√©court was scathing about SOE's \\"incredible ignorance of local (i.e. anti-Semitic) conditions\\" in sending Bloch to France. Bloch may have been arrested because he had been denounced as a Jew rather than the Germans knowing he was a SOE agent. Bloch was executed three months later.Grehan, John and Mace, Martin (2012), Unearthing Churchill's Secret Army, Barnsley, South Yorkshire: Pen and Sword Military, p. 20 Without a wireless operator, Vom√©court had no means of communicating with London. His immediate need was money. He had financed nearly all the expenses of the network from his own pocket. Through an attorney in Paris, he was introduced on 26 December 1942 to a 32-year-old woman named Mathilde Carr√© who was a leader of a Franco/Polish espionage network known as INTERALLI√â. She was nicknamed La Chatte, i.e. \\"the Cat\\"); her code code name was Victoire and she was also called Lily. She said she had access to a wireless and could arrange for the transmittal of messages from Vom√©ecourt to London. He was initially suspicious and tested her with a message to London asking SOE in London for money. Two days later SOE responded and Carr√© told him a British agent would give him the money in Vichy. Vom√©court went to Vichy and received the money. SOE headquarters was aware of Interalli√© and had been working with them.Cookridge, E. H. (1967), Set Europe Ablaze, New York: Thomas Y. Cromwell, pp. 70‚Äì71, 78 What neither SOE headquarters nor Vom√©court knew was that Interalli√© was \\"burned\\" and that Carr√© was working for the German intelligence agency, the Abwehr. In October 1941, the Interalli√© had come to the attention of the Germans and a sergeant who spoke French, Hugo Bleicher, was tasked with infiltrating the network. A captured agent gave Bleicher names and addresses of Interalli√© members. In November, twenty-one members of Interalli√© were arrested by the Abwehr in Cherbourg and on 17 November the leaders, including Carr√©, were arrested in Paris. The Germans also captured four radio transmitters. Bleicher persuaded Carr√©, with the option of being executed otherwise, to work for the Germans. Carr√© introduced Bleicher to Vom√©court as \\"Jean Castell,\\" a Belgian resistance leader. Carr√© also became Bleicher's lover.Cookridge, pp. 75‚Äì78Foot, p. 190 Vom√©court was still suspicious of Carr√© and in January 1942, his suspicions were heightened. He asked her to procure forged identity cards and she complied quickly, too quickly in his opinion and the cards were too good. Challenged, she admitted she was working for the Germans. Vom√©court then hatched a plan for Carr√© to persuade the Germans that she should go to SOE headquarters in London with him. Carr√© persuaded the Germans that she could return to France with valuable information about SOE. The Abwehr accepted her story and in early February, sent a message to London, supposedly from Vom√©court, requesting immediate evacuation from France of Vom√©court and Carr√©, saying their lives were in danger. After many misadventures, the two reached England by boat on 27 February.Foot, pp. 190‚Äì192 This was the end of Carr√©'s career as a double and triple agent. She was interrogated and imprisoned for the remainder of the war.\\"Carre, Mathilde,\\" , accessed 20 January 2020 Return to France and capture Colditz Castle POW camp in 1945. In London, Vom√©court met with the highest levels of the British government, including War Secretary Anthony Eden and Field Marshall Alan Brooke, and gave them his assessment of the German army in France, the Resistance, and the SOE's work. He wanted to return to France as soon as possible and proposed a plan of returning with Carr√© and, among other things, assassinating Bleicher. His plans were turned down and on 1 April 1942, he was parachuted blind (no reception party) onto his brother Philippe's estate near Limoges. He took on a new code name, Sylvain. The Germans were apparently still unaware that Carr√© was now working with the British.Foot, p. 192Cookridge, p. 84 The arrival of a new wireless operator for Vom√©court was delayed and he was forced to use a courier who carried messages to SOE agent Virginia Hall, an American in Vichy France. His courier was captured and the papers he carried were confiscated. Hugo Bleicher recognized Vom√©court's handwriting on one of the documents and realized he was back in France. Bleicher began arresting known associates of Vom√©court and learned from one of them of a meeting at a Paris cafe that Vom√©court was to attend. Vom√©court was arrested at the cafe on 25 April. After his arrest, Vom√©court and Bleicher had an amiable meeting at which both bemoaned their betrayal by \\"the Cat.\\"Foot, p. 193Cookridge, p. 85 With the arrest of Vom√©court and his associates the pioneering Autogiro network was destroyed. The men were initially held in Fresnes Prison in Paris. Put on trial near the end of 1942, Vom√©court persuaded the judges \\"by a final effort of personality\\" to give him and his associates the protection of the Geneva Convention as prisoners of war (POWs), thereby avoiding the fate of being sent to a Nazi concentration camp and executed. Vom√©court and his associates were transferred to the relative comfort of a POW camp for officers at Colditz Castle. Allied forces freed him on 15 April 1945.Foot, p. 193 Pierre de Vom√©court's brother Jean was captured and executed by the Germans during the war.
