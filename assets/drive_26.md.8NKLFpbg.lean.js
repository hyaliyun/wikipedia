It was located near the modern Palazzolo Acreide.  History  Akrai was among the first colonies of Syracuse founded by Corinthian colonists arriving in Sicilian territory in 663 BC. It was on the road to Gela, along with the Pantalica, Kasmene (military outpost on Monte Lauro), Akrillai and Camarina (the most distant of the colonies, founded 598 BC). Akrai and Kasmene were founded by the Syracusans: Akrai, seventy years after Syracuse, Kasmenae about twenty years later (c.640 BC). The original colonisation of Kamarina is attributed to the Syracusans, around a hundred and thirty years after the foundation of Syracuse; the founders were called Daskon and Menekolos.Thucydides, Peloponnesian War, 6.5 Loyal to Syracuse, it nevertheless had its own political life with administrative and military autonomy. Notably, its army intercepted the invasion force of Nicias in the Val di Noto or Anapo in 421 BC, contributing to his defeat. Constructed on the peak of a hill, Akrai was difficult to attack and at the time of its construction an ideal point for watching the surrounding territory. Indeed, Dion of Syracuse, when marching upon Syracuse, halted at Acrae to watch the effect of his proceedings.Plutarch Dio 27, where we should certainly read ·ºåŒ∫œÅŒ±œÇ for ŒúŒ±Œ∫œÅŒ¨œÇ. By the treaty concluded by the Romans with Hieron II, king of Syracuse (270 - 215 BC), Akrai was included in the dominions of that monarch, and this was probably the period of its greatest prosperity. During the Second Punic War it followed the fortunes of Syracuse, and afforded a place of refuge to Hippocrates of Syracuse, after his defeat by Marcus Claudius Marcellus at Acrillae, 214 BC. In 211 BC, after the fall of Syracuse, it became part of the Roman province, being known in Latin as Acre. This is the last mention of it in Classical history, and its name is not once noticed by Cicero. It was probably in his time a mere dependency of Syracuse, though it is found in Pliny's list of the \\"stipendiariae civitates,\\" so that it must then have possessed a separate municipal existence, and is noted by the geographer Ptolemy. The city continued to be under Roman rule into the Byzantine period.  Excavations  South-east Sicily and the Greek cities in red and the Native settlements in blue. The Via Selinuntina in yellow and the Via Elorina in green. One of the first scholars to identify the site of the lost city was a Sicilian monk Tommaso Fazello (1498‚Äì1570). Subsequently others showed interest in the site, especially baron Gabriele Judica, who undertook the first archaeological excavations at the site in the early 19th century and described his findings in the book Le antichit√† di Acre (The Antiquities of Akrai), published in 1819. Unearthed monuments were described also by German scholar Julius Schubring. In the 20th century Akrai had been investigated by various scholars including farther-founder of Sicilian archaeology Paolo Orsi (at the beginning of the 20th century), Luigi Bernab√≤ Brea (in the 50s), Giuseppe Voza (in the 70s) and Maria Musumeci with Lorenzo Guzzardi (in the 90s). Excavations of the archaic city have revealed a theatre which is relatively small but were very well reconstructed. There are two stone quarries known as Intagliata and Intagliatella that were used as catacombs and dwellings in the late Antiquity. On the flat area above Intagliata are the foundation stones of the Aphrodision, the temple of Aphrodite, erected in the mid-6th century BC. At the western end of the site is the Bouleuterion, where the city council met. East of the hill are the Feral Temples, dedicated to the cult of the dead. Most of the researches that had been undertaken in the XXth century brought into light public architecture. Currently, the image of life in Akrai is being fulfilled by the results of researches on residential part of the city. Greek and Roman houses have been discovered recently by Polish mission from University of Warsaw led by professor Roksana Chowaniec.  Polish mission in Akrai  The residential part of the city was recognized during the first season of non-invasive researches in 2009. Archaeologists mapped the site and proceeded with geophysical detection. In between 2010‚Äì2017 regular archaeological excavations were carried out. Archaeologists discovered the remains of Greco-Roman houses and numerous artifacts. Currently, international team of archaeologists is elaborating the findings that include: coins, different types of pottery, glass, metal and stone objects. Multidisciplinary researches engage archaeometric, lipid, petrographic, and isotopic analyses. All the results are published regularly in international journals and in the form of monographs (Akrai Studies, see: Chowaniec R. ed., Unveiling the past of an ancient town.

While some copyright agencies may also act as copyright collection societies, not all have that authority, and many copyright collection societies are only authorised by the government to manage schemes on their behalf and are completely independent. Copyright is a kind of intellectual property which protects the original expression of ideas. Creators can use it to manage how their content is reproduced.  Function  The core function of the Copyright Agency is to set and issue licenses to users of copyright protected material, collect licence revenue and distribute these as royalties money collected fairly and equitably to copyright owners and creators. They think that creators and publishers should receive a fair reward when their work is re-used. The way to ensure this is to issue licenses to organisations that want to copy and re-use their published work. The license fees collected are then passed on to the copyright owners - the authors, publishers and visual artists - that they represent. Any organisation photocopying, scanning or digitally reproducing material from copyright publications will usually require a licence to ensure legal compliance. The licences will help to reduce the risk and potential cost of copyright infringement. This requirement applies to organisations in the business, education, public or charitable sector. Copying refers to photocopying, scanning and re-use of content from magazines, books, journals, electronic and online publications, as well as press clippings or documents supplied by a licensed third party. The licences provide a cost-effective way to manage the risk associated with using and reproducing copyright materials. The Copyright Agency  Viscopy in Australia collects fees and distributes royalties to creator members for the reuse of their copyrighted text and images. They also manage the schools and universities copying schemes, the Federal, State and Territory government copying schemes, the Resale Royalty scheme for artists, and the special provisions for institutions assisting people with print disabilities. Businesses demonstrating best practice governance purchase commercial licences from the Copyright Agency  Viscopy for improved compliance and to protect themselves from infringement. Their members are authors, poets and playwrights, journalists, publishers, visual artists, photographers, cartoonists and illustrators and surveyors. Since July 2012, Copyright Agency has managed Viscopy's services. Viscopy's members are just visual artists artists and artists‚Äô estates.

Type of Commercial Licences  # CopyrightAccess Licence This licence is suitable when your business is using published material from magazines, journals, websites or books throughout the business or photocopying newspaper articles. # NewsAccess Licence for business Digital use of newspapers. For example, this will enable your employees to scan in an article that they see in a newspaper about your business or its competitors and share it with their colleagues # ContentAccess Licence for PR and marketing firms For public relations or marketing firms wishing to copy and distribute press clippings to clients and staff # Licences for press clipping agencies Specifically designed for companies providing press clipping services to businesses # Funeral directors and crematoria Delivering funeral, bereavement, remembrance or related services to the public in a funeral home or crematoria.  Benefit of Licences  * Allows the copying of content from most publications * Reduces the risk and the potential cost of copyright infringement * Offers the only way to get blanket cover so you don't have to seek permission from each copyright owner individually * Provides the convenience and certainty of a single transaction with one annual fee  Educational Licenses  The licence, set out in the Copyright Act, allows teachers to copy and share text and images in ways that usually require permission provided that fair compensation is made to the creators of the content. In addition to arrangements with peak bodies for schools and universities negotiated through Copyright Advisory Group ‚Äì Schools (CAG), the Copyright Agency also has individual agreements with more than 1,000 other education providers, including: private independent colleges, RTOs, training arms, community colleges and kindergartens. Licenses are required by Independent Education institutions where no agreement exists. Under the education copying scheme, teachers can copy and communicate text, images and print music without a copyright clearance if: * It is for educational purposes * Copying or sharing must only be for educational purposes. If it is also for other purposes (e.g. if a copy is made available to the general public), then the licence does not apply. This includes copying and sharing content in connection with a course of instruction, and copying content for the library's collection. * The statutory license allows the use of text and images from any source or format: * Digital or hardcopy * Online or offline * Australian or foreign content * Published or unpublished content The Government has also appointed Screenrights to manage the licence that allows educational institutions to copy and share broadcast content, such as documentaries shown on television. The education copying scheme (statutory licence) allows any form of ‚Äòreproduction‚Äô or ‚Äòcommunication‚Äô. This includes adding to or changing the content, or presenting it in a different context. The licence doesn't apply to translations from one language to another, or to a ‚Äòdramatic version‚Äô of a non-dramatic work (such as screenplay based on a short story), or vice versa (e.g. a novel based on a film).  Commercial Licenses  Businesses copy and share a wide range of information on a daily basis for analysis, to educate staff, monitor competitor activity and keep up-to-date with the latest industry news and trends. Most of this material is copyright protected and requires a licence. The Copyright Agency provides a range of copyright licences to cover the use of copyright material for specific business needs.

He founded FTM International, one of the first organizations specifically for FTM individuals, and his activism and community work was a significant contributor to the rapid growth of the FTM community during the late 1980s.\\"Guide to the Louis Graydon Sullivan Papers, 1755-1991 (bulk 1961-1991)\\". The Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender Historical Society. San Francisco, 1999. Accessed November 4, 2015. Early life Sullivan grew up in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Sullivan was born the third child of six in a very religious Catholic family and attended Catholic primary and secondary school. Sullivan started keeping a journal at the age of 10, describing his early childhood thoughts of being a boy, confusing adolescence, sexual fantasies of being a gay man, and his involvement in the Milwaukee music scene.Stryker, Susan. \\"The Difficult Decades.\\" In Transgender History. Berkeley, CA: Seal Press, 2008. During his adolescence he expressed continued confusion about his identity, writing at age 15 in 1966 that \\"I want to look like what I am but don't know what some one like me looks like. I mean, when people look at me I want them to think‚Äî there's one of those people [‚Ä¶] that has their own interpretation of happiness. That's what I am.\\"Sullivan, Lou. Diary. 1966. As quoted in \\"FTM Newsletter\\", Summer 2007, edited by Susan Stryker. Archived from the original on November 4, 2015. Sullivan was attracted to the idea of playing different gender roles, and his attraction for male roles was outlined in his writings, specifically in his short stories, poems and diaries; he often explored the ideas of male homosexuality and gender identity. At the age of seventeen he began a relationship with a self-described \\"feminine\\" male lover, and together they would play with gender roles and gender-bending. Transition and adulthood In 1973, Sullivan identified himself as a \\"female transvestite\\" and by 1975 he identified himself as a \\"female-to-male transsexual\\". In 1975, it \\"became apparent\\" that Sullivan needed to leave Milwaukee for somewhere where he could find \\"more understanding\\" and access hormones for his transition, so he decided to move to San Francisco.Murray, Eldon E. \\"I Remember Lou Sullivan\\". \\"FTM Newsletter\\", Summer 2007. Archived from the original on November 4, 2015. His family was supportive of the move and gave him \\"a handsome man's suit and [his] grandfather's pocket watch\\" as going-away presents. Upon arrival in San Francisco, Sullivan began working at the Wilson Sporting Good Company, where he was employed as a woman but cross dressed as a man much of the time. In his personal life, Sullivan lived as an out gay man, but he was repeatedly denied sex reassignment surgery (SRS) because of his sexual orientation and the expectation of the time that transgender people should adopt stereotypical heterosexual opposite-sex gender roles. This rejection led Sullivan to start a campaign to remove homosexuality from the list of contraindications for SRS. In 1976, Sullivan suffered a severe crisis of gender identity and continued living as a feminine heterosexual woman for the next three years. In 1978 he was shaken by the death of his youngest brother. In 1979, Sullivan was finally able to find doctors and therapists who would accept his sexuality and began taking testosterone, with double mastectomy surgery following a year later. He then left his previous job to work as an engineering technician at the Atlantic-Ritchfield Company so that he could fully embrace his new identity as a man with new co-workers. In 1986, Sullivan obtained genital reconstruction surgery. He was diagnosed as HIV positive shortly after his surgery, and told he only had 10 months to live.AIDS: The FTM Response and the Death of Lou Sullivan.\\" - OutHistory. http://outhistory.org/oldwiki/AIDS:_The_FTM_Response It is likely that Sullivan was HIV- infected in 1980, just after his chest surgery.

From July 1979 to October 1980, Sullivan edited The Gateway, a newsletter with \\"news and information on transvestism and transsexualism\\"The Gateway, July 1979, pg. 1. http://www.outhistory.org/exhibits/show/man-i- fest/item/945. that was circulated by the Golden Gate Girls/Guys. It was originally primarily focused on the needs of MTF and transvestite readers and read \\"much like a small town newspaper\\", but under Sullivan's editing it gained more gender parity between MTF and FTM issues. According to Megan Rohrer, Sullivan \\"transform[ed] Gateway in a way that [would] forever change FTM mentoring\\" because trans people could still obtain information on how to pass without having to attend group gatherings in person. =GLBT Historical Society= Sullivan was a founding member and board member of the GLBT Historical Society (formerly the Gay and Lesbian Historical Society) in San Francisco.

The Historical Society has displayed selected materials from Sullivan's papers in a number of exhibitions, notably \\"Man-i-fest: FTM Mentoring in San Francisco from 1976 to 2009,\\" which was open through much of 2010 in the second gallery at the society's headquarters at 657 Mission St. in San Francisco, and \\"Our Vast Queer Past: Celebrating San Francsico's GLBT History,\\" the debut exhibition in the main gallery at the society's GLBT History Museum that opened in January 2011 in San Francisco's Castro District. =Lobbying for recognition of gay trans men= Sullivan lobbied the American Psychiatric Association and the World Professional Association for Transgender Health for them to recognize his existence as a gay trans man. He was determined to change people's attitudes towards trans homosexualsMore, Kate, and Stephen Whittle. \\"Reclaiming Genders.\\" October 1, 1999. Page 77 but also to change the medical process of transition by removing sexual orientation from the criteria of gender identity disorder so that trans men who are gay could also access hormones and surgery, essentially making the process \\"orientation blind\\".  Honors  In June 2019, Sullivan was one of the inaugural fifty American ‚Äúpioneers, trailblazers, and heroes‚Äù inducted on the National LGBTQ Wall of Honor within the Stonewall National Monument (SNM) in New York City‚Äôs Stonewall Inn. The SNM is the first U.S. national monument dedicated to LGBTQ rights and history, and the wall‚Äôs unveiling was timed to take place during the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots. In August 2019, Sullivan was one of the honorees inducted in the Rainbow Honor Walk, a walk of fame in San Francisco‚Äôs Castro neighborhood noting LGBTQ people who have \\"made significant contributions in their fields.\\" Works * \\"A Transvestite Answers a Feminist\\" in Gay People's Union News (1973) * \\"Looking Towards Transvestite Liberation\\" in Gay People's Union News (1974) * Female to Male Cross Dresser and Transsexual (1980) * Information for the Female to Male Cross Dresser and Transsexual (1990) * From Female To Male: The Life of Jack Bee Garland (1990) ReferencesExternal links *Guide to the Louis Graydon Sullivan Papers, 1755‚Äì1991, giving an overview of the GLBT Historical Society's collection of Sullivan's papers, photographs, diaries, short stories, poems, essays, and correspondence *Man-i-fest: FTM Mentorship in San Francisco from 1976‚Äì2009, an overview of an exhibit by the GLBT Historical Society on the letters and work of Lou Sullivan * Biography of Lou Sullivan at A Gender Variance Who's Who * A special edition of FTM Newsletter celebrating and remembering Lou Sullivan * \\"Uncle Lou\\", an article on Daily Kos written by one of Sullivan's relatives for the 20th anniversary of his death * The Lou Sullivan Society *Lou Sullivan Collection on Digital Transgender Archive *The Life of Lou Project, a digital project dedicated to Lou's writings and achievements Further reading * Smith, Brice (2017).

This discovery led Fred Griffith to show that one pneumococcal type could be transformed into another (Griffith's experiment). Subsequently, Oswald Avery demonstrated that the transforming substance was DNA. All modern molecular biology has evolved from this work. Early years Neufeld was the son of a physician. He was musically talented and a gifted pianist. In 1894, Neufeld became assistant to Robert Koch. He worked with Koch on studies of tuberculosis and went to Rhodesia with Koch in 1903 to study rinderpest. Neufeld's discoveries In 1900 Neufeld discovered bile solubility of pneumococci.Neufeld F. √úber eine spezifische bakteriolytische Wirkung der Galle. Zeitschrift fur Hygiene Infektionskrankheiten. 1900;34:454-64. Addition of a small amount of ox bile to a pneumococcal culture results in complete destruction of the culture after a short incubation. This unique property became widely used to diagnose pneumococcal infections. Then, using immunological techniques, Neufeld discovered that there were three pneumococcal types. In the presence of type I antiserum type I pneumococci would swell, likewise types II and III in the presence of their specific antisera. Neufeld called this the quellung reaction, after the German word for swelling.Neufeld F. √úber die Agglutination der Pneumokokken und √ºber die Theorieen der Agglutination.

Its legislative process was accompanied by controversy over the bill's content and effects and rallies were held by supporters and opponents. The bill passed the Hawaii House of Representatives in February 2009 in a form specific to same-sex couples, was passed in amended form including opposite- sex couples by the Hawaii Senate in May 2009, and was carried over in the 2010 session, where it passed the Senate again in January 2010 with a veto-proof majority. The bill moved back to the House but was indefinitely postponed by a voice vote initiated by House Speaker Calvin Say, requiring a vote of two- thirds of Representatives to be taken up again in 2010, and was considered dead. In April 2010, on the last day of the legislative session, the House suspended the rules on the Senate bill and passed it with a majority, sending the bill to Governor Linda Lingle, who vetoed it in July 2010. Hawaii did not allow same-sex marriages or civil unions, but two unmarried people can register for a reciprocal beneficiary relationship, which provides some of the rights and benefits that come with marriage. The bill was written to become law on January 1, 2010, would allow all couples to obtain rights equal to those of married couples, and make Hawaii the only state in the Western United States to allow civil unions instead of domestic partnerships. Content of the bill House Bill 444 H.D. 1 as introduced and passed by the Hawaii House of Representatives \\"extends the same rights, benefits, protections, and responsibilities of spouses in a marriage to partners in a civil union.\\" To be eligible for a civil union, the bill outlined that the person seeking a civil union may not already be in a civil union, marriage, or reciprocal beneficiary relationship with someone else, the two people seeking a civil union must be of the same sex, both members of the civil union must be 18 years or older, and the two partners must not be related. The bill also enumerated familial relationships in which civil unions would be automatically nullified, such as a man with his father, grandfather, or son, or a woman with her mother, grandmother, or daughter. If one of the persons had a guardian, the guardian had to consent for the subject to obtain a civil union. Section 1, ¬ß ‚Äî9 of House Bill 444 explained that \\"partners to a civil union ... shall have all the same rights, benefits, protections, and responsibilities under law ... as are granted to spouses in a marriage.\\" The bill also recognized domestic partnerships, civil unions, and same-sex marriages performed in other states as civil unions in Hawaii, and would have taken effect on January 1, 2010. In addition, House Bill 444 repealed a statute that declared \\"private solemnization not unlawful.\\" House Bill S.D. 1 444 as passed by the Hawaii Senate was amended to remove the bill's reference to same-sex couples, include language stating the legislature's intent not change the definition of marriage, and include partners in civil unions for use of the terms \\"spouse\\", \\"family\\", \\"immediate family\\", \\"dependent\\", and \\"next of kin\\". The language of the bill's coming into effect remained unchanged at January 1, 2010. Legislative processPast bills= Hawaii House of Representatives chamber Following Baehr v. Lewin, a 1993 decision by the Supreme Court of Hawaii that found the state's refusal to grant same-sex couples marriage licenses discriminatory, voters in 1998 approved a constitutional amendment granting the Hawaii State Legislature the power to reserve marriage to opposite-sex couples, and the legislature passed a law banning same-sex marriage. Civil unions were not restricted. Bills creating civil unions were considered several times, but failed to receive committee approval prior to 2009. =2009 session= H.B. 444 was introduced in the Hawaii House of Representatives on January 26, 2009. It passed the Hawaii House Judiciary Committee on February 5, 2009, with 12 members voting in favor and none opposed and was approved by the Hawaii House of Representatives on February 12, 2009, with 33 members voting in favor and 17 opposed, one vote fewer than the two-thirds vote needed to override a veto by the Republican Governor Linda Lingle, who did not indicate whether she considered a veto. It was referred to the Hawaii Senate on February 13, 2009. A hearing by the Committee on Judiciary and Government Operations (JGO) was held at the State Capitol on February 24, 2009, with the outcome of three senators supporting the bill and three opposed; the bill was not passed out of committee. The Senate Democratic leadership stated the bill might be taken from committee and brought to a debate before the full Senate, which was possible after March 10, 2009. Following a rally held on February 22, 2009, that opposed the passage of H.B. 444 and in which between 2,000 and 8,000 people participated, a number of Democratic senators became unwilling to vote in favor of the motion, citing concerns about changing common Senate procedure. The number of senators supporting civil unions was reduced from 18 to 13 out of 25 senators. Supporters held a candlelight vigil attended by 300 to 400 people in support of the bill on March 7, 2009. Vigil attended by supporters of H.B. 444 on March 7, 2009 Senator Will Espero offered an amendment to the bill that would have reduced the number of benefits granted, stating this would remove concerns that civil unions were similar to marriage. Passing an amended bill would have required the House to vote on it again or to establish a conference committee to negotiate differences between versions of both chambers. Supporters of civil unions stated they would not support the compromise, and a senator argued that \\"an amendment will kill it.\\" Hawaii Senate Majority Leader Gary Hooser stated in March 2009 he would try to bring the bill to a vote if no other senator did so by the end of the legislative session in May 2009. It was not clear how many senators supported Hooser and opposing groups announced protests if action was taken. On March 25, 2009, the attempt to bring the bill before the full Senate failed when six senators supported the measure instead of the required nine senators. Senate President Colleen Hanabusa and JGO chairman Brian Taniguchi had opposed recalling H.B. 444 from Taniguchi's committee, citing unwillingness to change the traditional lawmaking process. On May 7, 2009, a second motion to recall the bill from committee, initiated by Senator Les Ihara, Jr., was successful after 10 Democrats voted in favor. The Senate Democratic Leadership, Democrats opposed to civil unions, and Senate Republicans voted in favor of an amendment to the bill that added language reaffirming the distinction between civil unions and marriage and allowing same-sex and opposite-sex couples to enter civil unions. The amendment was adopted, which killed the bill, as a revised version required renewed approval by the Hawaii House of Representatives and the legislature adjourned May 8, 2009. Senate President Hanabusa stated the issue would not be taken up again before 2010. =2010 session= The bill was carried over into the 2010 session and Lingle stated in January 2010 that the bill was a distraction from the budget and should not be voted on for final passage in the Senate. Senator Brian Taniguchi argued the legislature could work on several issues simultaneously and the bill would pass. If passed, the amended bill would have to be approved by the House of Representatives. Speaker of the House Calvin Say stated that a vote on the bill would depend on whether the Senate passed the bill with enough votes to override a gubernatorial veto, arguing that he does not want to force a vote on controversial legislation in an election year if the bill's approval was in doubt. The Senate bill contains an effective date of January 1, 2010, and if the language is not changed, the bill could be vetoed regardless of its content. The Senate passed an unchanged bill on January 22, 2010, with a veto-proof two-thirds' majority, after an amendment to update the effective date was rejected. The measure moved for final approval to the House of Representatives, but on January 29, House Speaker Calvin Say moved to indefinitely postpone a vote on the bill, which was approved by voice vote. No votes were recorded and the move deferred action on the bill for 2010 unless two-thirds of Representatives vote to reconsider the bill, and it was considered dead. On April 29, the last day of the legislative session, the Senate bill was revived in the Hawaii House following a motion by Majority Leader Blake Oshiro. Speaker Calvin Say immediately ordered a recess and after the representatives returned four votes to suspend legislative rules postponing the issue were taken and the bill passed with 31 to 20 votes. Governor Linda Lingle had until July 6 to decide whether to sign or veto the measure. The House vote margin in support is not large enough to override a gubernatorial veto. Lingle vetoed the bill on July 6, arguing civil unions should be decided by referendum. The House had ruled out any attempt to override her vetoes for the legislative session. Reactions Following the introduction of H.B. 444, gay rights organizations stated their support, arguing the bill supported equality in an ethnically diverse state. Religious groups began to set up websites, take out newspaper advertisements and hold rallies in opposition to the bill, arguing it ran against marriage. The Roman Catholic Bishop of Honolulu, Clarence Richard Silva, called the bill \\"a travesty to the democratic process\\" that \\"ignores the will of the people.\\" Marc Alexander, vicar general of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Honolulu, argued that civil unions are \\"same-sex marriage under a different name\\". The non-profit organization Hawaii Family Forum, which opposed the bill, organized the February 22 rally with local churches and achieved a large turnout. Interfaith Alliance Hawaii, made up of people of Christian, Jewish and Buddhist faiths, stated their support for the bill and argued it did not \\"endanger [civil unions opponents'] concept of marriage or family values.\\" Linda Krieger, a University of Hawaii law professor and adviser for a student gay rights group, stated \\"where the fundamental civil rights of an unpopular minority are at stake, the principle of 'letting the people decide' is often a mere cloak for majoritarian tyranny.\\" The First Unitarian Church of Honolulu sponsored a poll that found 70 percent opposition to same-sex marriage and 67 percent support on whether gays and lesbians should have the \\"same rights as everyone else.\\" The Senate hearings on the bill attracted large turnout and testimony was recorded for 15 hours. In the hearing, bill opponents outnumbered supporters. Mike Gabbard, who sponsored the 1998 amendment permitting the legislature to outlaw same-sex marriage, argued the bill would lead to same-sex marriage being taught in Hawaiian schools. Kim Coco Iwamoto of the Hawaii Board of Education countered civil unions would make children in gay families less likely to be harassed. Lieutenant Governor of Hawaii Duke Aiona criticized the bill, arguing it \\"attempts to circumvent the will of the people by authorizing the equivalent to same-sex marriage\\". U.S. Representative Neil Abercrombie supported the bill, stating \\"it is shameful that while they must give their equal share to the government, the government will not give them equal protection\\" about gay and lesbian citizens of Hawaii. The Honolulu Advertiser reported that the Senate Democratic leadership reconsidered their support for the bill because of the large demonstration of opponents and their pressure on senators to oppose the bill. It found that some senators privately suggested the bill's delay in committee or a proposed amendment to the bill were ways to avoid taking a vote following the controversy. The candlelight vigil following the bill's defeat in committee was attended by labor union members and religious groups. Father Richard Shields of the Episcopal Diocese of Hawaii stated religion should be taken out of the argument and a spokesperson for the hotel and restaurant union Local 5 argued the bill provided economic justice. A letter later sent to senators in support of the H.B. 444 by community groups, including the Local 5 union, the Hawaii NAACP, the Hawaii State Democratic Women's Caucus, and the Japanese American Citizens League. In response to Majority Leader Gary Hooser's statement that he intended to bring the bill to a vote before the full Senate, the Hawaii Family Forum stated other issues demanded more attention than civil unions and the bill would create legal challenges for child care and education. The group held demonstrations on Maui and Kauai and stated their intention to hold demonstrations to ask the governor to veto the legislation should the bill advance. Hooser argued for the bill using President Barack Obama's support of civil unions and the support of labor unions and the majority of Hawaii House representatives. The Honolulu Advertiser reported that Senate President Colleen Hanabusa privately told senators the bill could lead to a lawsuit to legalize same-sex marriage. The American Civil Liberties Union of Hawaii and Supreme Court of Hawaii judge Steven H. Levinson told the legislature that a lawsuit would have little chance of success. Following the adoption of the amended version of H.B. 444, Senator Les Ihara, Jr. stated, \\"I have a hard time reconciling the statement that the proponents made, that this is for equal rights and civil unions‚Äîat the same time, this kills it for the session.\\" Michael Golojuch of Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays called the vote \\"a dog-and-pony show\\". Hawaii Family Forum leader and former Democratic state representative Dennis Arakaki commented that \\"things worked out for the good.\\" Hooser began a campaign in June 2009 to be elected Lieutenant Governor of Hawaii in 2010, calling his support for the bill an act on a \\"critical issue\\". Neil Abercrombie was elected to succeed Linda Lingle as governor in the 2010 gubernatorial election, defeating Duke Aiona. On July 6, 2010, following Lingle's veto of the bill, Lambda Legal and the ACLU announced that they would file a lawsuit to enable civil unions, stating that \\"our constitution prevents discrimination based on sexual orientation.\\"Lambda Legal and ACLU Ready Lawsuit Following Veto of HB 444Article I, Section 5 of the Hawaii State Constitution: \\"No person shall ... be denied the enjoyment of the person's civil rights or be discriminated against in the exercise thereof because of race, religion, sex or ancestry.\\" References and notesReferencesNotes=External links * Category:Hawaii statutes Category:LGBT rights in Hawaii Category:2010 in Hawaii Category:Same-sex union legislation in the United States ","title":"Hawaii House Bill 444"},{"id":"21689885","text":"Mece (; ) is a settlement in the region of Baranja, Croatia.

It has been implicated in numerous large earthquakes. It is one of the two major faults created by the Australian and Pacific plate convergence, the other being the Ramu-Markham Fault zone. Location The Sorong fault begins around Sulawesi and runs towards New Guinea. It marks the boundary between Halmahera plate and Bird's Head Plate. The Sorong fault system has been documented to extend westward more than 500 miles (800 km) from Teluk Sarera to Kepulauan Banggai. Geology The fault zone juxtaposes Mesozoic- Tertiary continental and volcanic arc/ophiolitic rocks. Plate evolution It is widely believed that fragments of the northern Australian continental margin in New Guinea are being detached and translated westward in this shear zone until they collide with the eastern margin of Eurasia (Sundaland) in the region of Sulawesi Island. However, the details of terrane translation, amalgamation, and docking remain poorly documented at this time. In particular, the timing of events is very poorly constrained, with estimates for the commencement of the SFZ ranging from early Miocene or older to Pleistocene. Investigations in the 1990s of the SFZ and the adjacent regions of Sulawesi and Irian Jaya (Indonesian New Guinea), including fieldwork in several of the SFZ island-terranes (Waigeo Island, Halmahera, Bacan, Obi Islands, and Sula Islands), suggest a less mobilist interpretation of the region than previous reconstructions.

They include and generalize the Petersen graph. Definition and examples The odd graph On has one vertex for each of the (n ‚àí 1)-element subsets of a (2n ‚àí 1)-element set. Two vertices are connected by an edge if and only if the corresponding subsets are disjoint. That is, On is the Kneser graph KG(2n ‚àí 1,n ‚àí 1). O2 is a triangle, while O3 is the familiar Petersen graph. The generalized odd graphs are defined as distance-regular graphs with diameter n ‚àí 1 and odd girth 2n ‚àí 1 for some n. They include the odd graphs and the folded cube graphs. History and applications Although the Petersen graph has been known since 1898, its definition as an odd graph dates to the work of , who also studied the odd graph O4.. As cited by . Odd graphs have been studied for their applications in chemical graph theory, in modeling the shifts of carbonium ions... They have also been proposed as a network topology in parallel computing.. The notation On for these graphs was introduced by Norman Biggs in 1972.. Biggs and Tony Gardiner explain the name of odd graphs in an unpublished manuscript from 1974: each edge of an odd graph can be assigned the unique element of X which is the \\"odd man out\\", i.e., not a member of either subset associated with the vertices incident to that edge... Properties The odd graph On is regular of degree n. It has \\\\tbinom {2n-1}{n-1} vertices and n\\\\tbinom {2n-1}{n-1}/2 edges. Therefore, the number of vertices for n = 1, 2,... is :1, 3, 10, 35, 126, 462, 1716, 6435 . =Distance and symmetry= If two vertices in On correspond to sets that differ from each other by the removal of k elements from one set and the addition of k different elements, then they may be reached from each other in 2k steps, each pair of which performs a single addition and removal. If 2k < n, this is a shortest path; otherwise, it is shorter to find a path of this type from the first set to a set complementary to the second, and then reach the second set in one more step. Therefore, the diameter of On is n ‚àí 1. Every odd graph is 3-arc-transitive: every directed three-edge path in an odd graph can be transformed into every other such path by a symmetry of the graph.. Odd graphs are distance transitive, hence distance regular. As distance-regular graphs, they are uniquely defined by their intersection array: no other distance-regular graphs can have the same parameters as an odd graph.. However, despite their high degree of symmetry, the odd graphs On for n > 2 are never Cayley graphs.. Because odd graphs are regular and edge-transitive, their vertex connectivity equals their degree, n. Odd graphs with n > 3 have girth six; however, although they are not bipartite graphs, their odd cycles are much longer. Specifically, the odd graph On has odd girth 2n ‚àí 1\\\\. If a n-regular graph has diameter n ‚àí 1 and odd girth 2n ‚àí 1, and has only n distinct eigenvalues, it must be distance-regular. Distance-regular graphs with diameter n ‚àí 1 and odd girth 2n ‚àí 1 are known as the generalized odd graphs, and include the folded cube graphs as well as the odd graphs themselves.. =Independent sets and vertex coloring= Let On be an odd graph defined from the subsets of a (2n ‚àí 1)-element set X, and let x be any member of X. Then, among the vertices of On, exactly \\\\tbinom{2n-2}{n-2} vertices correspond to sets that contain x. Because all these sets contain x, they are not disjoint, and form an independent set of On. That is, On has 2n ‚àí 1 different independent sets of size \\\\tbinom{2n-2}{n-2}. It follows from the Erd≈ës‚ÄìKo‚ÄìRado theorem that these are the maximum independent sets of On. that is, the independence number of On is \\\\tbinom{2n-2}{n-2}. Further, every maximum independent set must have this form, so On has exactly 2n ‚àí 1 maximum independent sets.. If I is a maximum independent set, formed by the sets that contain x, then the complement of I is the set of vertices that do not contain x. This complementary set induces a matching in G. Each vertex of the independent set is adjacent to n vertices of the matching, and each vertex of the matching is adjacent to n ‚àí 1 vertices of the independent set. Because of this decomposition, and because odd graphs are not bipartite, they have chromatic number three: the vertices of the maximum independent set can be assigned a single color, and two more colors suffice to color the complementary matching. =Edge coloring= By Vizing's theorem, the number of colors needed to color the edges of the odd graph On is either n or n + 1, and in the case of the Petersen graph O3 it is n + 1\\\\. When n is a power of two, the number of vertices in the graph is odd, from which it again follows that the number of edge colors is n + 1.. However, O5, O6, and O7 can each be edge- colored with n colors. Biggs explains this problem with the following story: eleven soccer players in the fictional town of Croam wish to form up pairs of five-man teams (with an odd man out to serve as referee) in all 1386 possible ways, and they wish to schedule the games between each pair in such a way that the six games for each team are played on six different days of the week, with Sundays off for all teams. Is it possible to do so? In this story, each game represents an edge of O6, each weekday is represented by a color, and a 6-color edge coloring of O6 provides a solution to the players' scheduling problem. =Hamiltonicity= The Petersen graph O3 is a well known non- Hamiltonian graph, but all odd graphs On for n ‚â• 4 are known to have a Hamiltonian cycle. As the odd graphs are vertex-transitive, they are thus one of the special cases for which a positive answer to Lov√°sz' conjecture is known. Biggs conjectured more generally that the edges of On can be partitioned into \\\\lfloor n/2\\\\rfloor edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles. When n is odd, the leftover edges must then form a perfect matching. This stronger conjecture was verified for n = 4, 5, 6, 7. For n = 8, the odd number of vertices in On prevents an 8-color edge coloring from existing, but does not rule out the possibility of a partition into four Hamiltonian cycles.

The film originally debuted on the USA Network in 1990. The plot concerns the unseen driver of a primer gray Dodge Charger, (consisting of mixed year's makes 1971, 1974) kidnapping, molesting, and sometimes murdering young girls around the fictional locale of Copper Valley, Arizona and a bus driver who chases the car, after it kidnaps her daughter played by Marcie Leeds. Marcie Leeds was nominated for a Young Artist Award for Best Young Actress in a Cable Special. Plot On a desert highway in Arizona, a man and his daughter have broken down on the side of the road. After a truck does not stop to help them, they are then approached by a dirt- covered black 1974 Dodge Charger with a 400 V8. The driver of the Charger (who is never seen) then strikes the man, killing him, before backing up and abducting the screaming girl. Later, the girl is seen walking down the deserted highway, with signs of being assaulted. She is then spotted by two highway patrol officers, who put her in the back of their police car and take her to the hospital. Meanwhile, in the nearby town of Copper Valley, Laura (Cassidy) is a newly hired bus driver who has moved from Los Angeles, California in hopes of the small town being a better place to raise her daughter, Stephanie (Leeds). One day, she encounters the black Charger as she is taking kids home from school on a 1982 Chevy G30 Wayne Busette with a Chevy small-block engine. Shortly afterwards, the driver follows a young girl home and abducts her. The girl is sexually assaulted, but is later found alive, although clearly traumatized by what has happened. As the driver of the car continuously stalks Laura, it soon abducts Stephanie's friend Kim who is later found dead, floating in a nearby lake. Laura visits the police station and talks with Detective Drummond (Snyder), who says that in spite of all of the searches, nobody claims to have seen the car or its driver. The night after Kim's funeral, the Charger reappears in front of Laura's house. As Laura tries to contact the detective, the driver continues to rev his engine and drive around the front of the house, but soon drives away into the night. The following day, Stephanie is waiting on her mother to pick her up from gymnastics practice, but Laura is delayed by a passing freight train. As Laura arrives, the Charger appears and abducts Stephanie in front of her, prompting her to give chase, with kids still on the bus. After pursuing the car through town and down dirt roads, Laura loses sight of the car and is pulled over by a motorcycle cop. While the officer is talking to Laura and calling for backup, the car reappears and rams the cop, killing him instantly. The driver then speeds away with Stephanie leaning out the window, crying for help. Laura resumes the chase after the car, despite the kids continuously pleading for her to slow down. Soon, the bus nearly drives off the edge of a cliff near a train bridge. As Laura tries to restart the bus and put it in reverse, the car appears behind the bus and rams it repeatedly, trying to send it over the edge, but Laura manages to start up the bus and back it away from the edge, making the chase resume once again. Laura chases the car to a construction site and lets the kids off, asking them to call the police at a nearby trailer. After a long hunt, the car appears and tries to run Laura down when she gets out of the bus, but she manages to climb aboard and continue the chase. As they rumble into a quarry, Laura rams the car repeatedly, but is unsuccessful at stopping it. Finally, after a lengthy chase around the quarry, Stephanie manages to climb out of the Charger and climb onto the bus to her mother. Laura then rams the Charger and sends it tumbling over the edge of a cliff. Laura and Stephanie are tearfully reunited, however, just when it seems that the whole ordeal is ending, the car unexpectedly reappears and accelerates straight towards the bus. Laura manages to restart the bus and reverse out of the path of the speeding Charger, causing the car to fly off of a cliff and drop down the into the quarry. The car lands in a small storage building full of explosives, resulting in an explosion which incinerates the car and the driver. In the ending scene, Laura and Stephanie are seen boarding the school bus and driving off into the sunset.

Administratively, it is located in the Bilje municipality within the Osijek- Baranja County. Population is 608 people. History left left In classical antiquity location of present-day village was a part of a long Roman Danubian Limes three grave areals which were researched by archaeologists from Hungary before World War II, but two of them were destroyed in 1950 due to the dam construction. One necropolis was dated in the Late Antique period. First historical mention of the village comes from year 1212 during the reign of Andrew III of Hungary. 1713 it is mentioned as a Hungarian village with 18 families. Village is mentioned one source from 1591 in the period of Ottoman rule over the medieval Kingdom of Hungary when it was waqf with 100 Hungarian families living on it. 1713 it is mentioned as a Hungarian village with 18 families. According to local legend, prior to the arrival of Ottomans, there was a grand castle in the village. Dravafok or Dravatorok, early 20th century steamboat port and telegraphy station, belonged to the village. According to Roman Catholic Diocese of P√©cs data, village had 1203 inhabitants in 1839 and reached its peak in 1849 with 1412 inhabitants. All up until the 1918 and establishment of Kingdom of Yugoslavia village, together with the rest of Baranya, was part of Baranya County. In 1920 post World War I Treaty of Trianon was formally signed. During the Kingdom of Yugoslavia village was within the Danube Banovina. In World War II after the Invasion of Yugoslavia it was part of Kingdom of Hungary. Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia transferred the region to the Socialist Republic of Croatia. Due to the proximity of Danube river and its backwaters fishing was an important economic activity with up to the 200 fishermen in the village at its peak. Fishermen houses used the sign of fish on the facade of their homes so that urban visitors can know that they can buy fish at that place. After the establishment of Kopaƒçki Rit nature park in 1976 fishing was limited so the importance of vegetable production increased. Village is still organizing fishing festival every September attended by up to 2,000 visitors annually. Prior to Croatian War of Independence village had 805 inhabitants. During the war the village was within the boundaries of self-proclaimed SAO Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia, Republic of Serbian Krajina and after the Erdut Agreement was signed under the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium. Nature Kopaƒçki Rit Village of Kopaƒçevo is affected by regular flooding due to its proximity to both Danube and Drava rivers. Usually there are two floods annually, one in the spring known as a green flood, and one in August. Village is located next to the Kopaƒçki Rit, one of the most important, largest and most attractive preserved intact wetlands in Europe. Religion Reformed Christian Church in Kopaƒçevo was built in the 1804-1808 period. Its current form it got in 1848 during the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. During the Croatian War of Independence church was heavily devastated. It was reconstructed in 1999 with financial support of Government of Hungary. Prior to present day church, at the same spot there was a church from the 12th century that burned in the fire in 1666. Local fold story tells that at the same location there was one even older Gothic church from the 4th century. Local population of Kopaƒçevo was among the first to accept Calvinism in the 16th century and village became important center of Protestantism in the region.

The result of no less than five mergers of liberal and conservative liberal opposition parties, it could trace its roots to the Ethiopian Democratic Union, which mounted armed monarchist resistance to the Derg in the immediate aftermath of the overthrow of Haile Selassie I. In the legislative elections held on 15 May 2005, the United Ethiopian Democratic Party - Medhin, as it was then known, was part of the United Ethiopian Democratic Forces, that won 52 out of 527 seats in the Council of People's Representatives. It won no seats in the 2010 elections. Founding, mergers, and consolidation In October 1999 the Ethiopian Democratic Party (EDP) was registered following \\"40 weeks of political discussion\\". In mid-2000, the party held its first congress, electing Admassu Gebeyehu, Hailu Araya and Lidetu Ayalew as Chairman, Vice Chairman, and General Secretary, respectively. In September 2003, the EDP merged with the Ethiopian Democratic Union, becoming the United Ethiopian Democratic Party. Mengesha Seyoum became the party's honorary chairman, but played little role in the party administration, living in exile, and the post was quietly abolished. In September 2004 it merged with the Ethiopian Medhin (Salvation) Democratic Party founded by former Foreign Minister Goshu Wolde and became the United Ethiopian Democratic Party - Medhin. In early 2005 it absorbed the short-lived Ethiopian Democratic Action Group of Sophia Yilma, daughter of former Minister of Finance Yilma Deressa. In August 2005 Lidetu Ayalew was elected Party President, Sophia Yilma Vice President, and Mushe Semu Secretary General. =Merger history= The following is an illustration of the party's mergers and name changes. Electoral performance It agreed to contest the 2005 parliamentary elections as part of the Coalition for Unity and Democracy (CUD), winning 52 seats. It was one of the few to take their seats in parliament, splitting with the remainder of the coalition. There were soon inner power struggles within the CUD, however. Former Chairman Hailu Araya had backed the leadership of Berhanu Nega, but was defeated in the Party Congress in August. Lidetu and Mushe were suspended from the CUD Central Council in October, and the party central committee voted to leave the coalition.Leaders of UEDP-Medhin (UEDP-Medhin website) Lidetu was a victim of character assassination and defamation following the 2005 elections by the former CUD leaders. However, the election campaign in 2010 revealed that Lidetu and his party were not behind the unsuccessful unity.\\"Ethiopia: Ethnic Federalism and its Discontents; Africa Report No. 153 ‚Äì 4 September 2009\\" , International Crisis Group, p. 10 (accessed 16 November 2009) Despite this vindication, the party did not win any seats in the election, with the opposition overall winning only one seat. UEDP-Medhin at present uses its original name EDP - Ethiopian Democratic Party. In March 2011, Mushe Semu became party president, succeeding Lidetu. Political positions The EDP is one of the few Ethiopian parties with non-leftist origins, and had ties with the pre-revolutionary establishment. Correspondingly, it takes strong exception to the \\"ethnic federalist\\" and \\"democratic developmentalist\\" ideology of the ruling EPRDF. =Approach to governance and politics= The EDP is strongly opposed to the policy of Ethnic federalism and the division of Ethiopia on ethnic lines, supporting the restoration of the traditional provinces of Ethiopia within a federalist structure. It also supports the establishment of an independent judiciary, the observance of rule of law and human rights, as well as the strengthening of the rights of the federal regions. It rejects ethnic politics and as well as the general left-wing discourse of Ethiopian government. However, it is supportive of peaceful opposition and opposes armed struggle against the present government, condemning the endorsement of Berhanu Nega for the establishment of an armed resistance (later actualised as the \\"Ginbot 7 Popular Force\\") against the EPRDF government. It was this refusal to support armed struggle that was behind much of the allegations that the EDP was insufficiently opposed to or in collaboration with the EPRDF in the run-up to the 2010 elections. =Economic positions= Opposing the state interventionist policies of the government, the party contends that government policies have weakened the Ethiopian private sector and hampered prospects for long-term growth. It opposes continued state ownership of land and supports the reform to allow for private ownership of land, as well as increasing the property rights of smallholders. It is opposed to the price controls imposed to counter the high rate of inflation, saying that expansionary fiscal policies were to blame, and that punishing lending requirements on the private sector- private banks are required to set aside 27% of their lending for treasury bonds to fund large infrastructure projects- were hampering the economy, a position supported by the IMF, World Bank, and pro-business Ethiopian organisations like the Chamber of commerce and Capital Ethiopia.

Widely respected in the industry, his obituary in the Ocala Star-Banner was titled \\"Yowell leaves behind legacy of integrity.\\" A native of Pennsylvania, Eddie Yowell began his career in Thoroughbred racing in 1933 as a jockey. Following a successful career in which he was a leading jockey at New York's Empire City Race Track, he remained in the industry as a trainer. In 1951, at Monmouth Park Racetrack in Oceanport, New Jersey where he would become a two-time leading trainer, he notably won the first of his two Salvator Mile Handicaps with Call Over, his best runner to that time. Yowell's second Salvator Mile win came in 1963 during his best decade in racing. Yowell also had considerable success with Executioner whose wins included the Grade I Metropolitan Handicap. Triple Crown wins In 1964, Eddie Yowell trained the colt Hail To All for owner Zelda Cohen, the wife of Ben Cohen, co-owner and Secretary-Treasurer of Pimlico Race Course. At age three, Hail To All won the 1965 Jersey Derby, Travers Stakes. He ran fifth in the Kentucky Derby, third in the Preakness Stakes, and gave Yowell his first U.S. Triple Crown win in the Belmont Stakes. In 1971, Eddie Yowell earned his second Belmont Stakes win with Pass Catcher. Among the other notable horses Eddie Yowell trained was Merry Ruler, a multiple stakes winner in the early 1960s who equaled the Aqueduct track record in winning the Carter Handicap in May 1962 then in July set a new Aqueduct track record while winning the Gravesend Handicap. =Oak Crest Farm= A pioneer for what has become a major industry in Marion County, Florida, in the 1960s Eddie Yowell and Maryland horseman Arnold Wilcox established an breeding and training facility at Ocala, Florida. They named it Oak Crest Farm and raced horses under the banner of Oak Crest Stable. A substantial operation, in addition to living quarters, barns and sheds, the partners built a one-mile (1.6 km) training track that remains the property's centerpiece to this day. Through various owners over the years, the Ocala farm has been the breaking and training ground for ten Champions and two winners of American Horse of the Year honors. Yowell and Wilcox sold the property in 1977 to Robert Murty and his brothers who in 1983 sold half of the acreage, including the training track, to Dr. Jim and Sally Hill and their partners, Mickey and Karen Taylor. They raced under the name, Equusequity Stable. The Taylors are best known as the owners of U.S. Triple Crown winner, Seattle Slew. In 1992 the property became part of Allen Paulson's Brookside Farms operations. He sold it in April 2000 to Roy S. Lerman who renamed it Lambholm South. On July 14, 2006, Lerman sold the property to Ohio businessman Larry Roberts who uses it as an American Quarter Horse breeding and training operation. Health problems forced Eddie Yowell to retire in the summer of 1991. He died a few months later on October 29 from cancer.

It is found in cruciferous vegetables such as cabbage, brussels sprouts and rapeseed oil, and is formed by the hydrolysis of a glucosinolate: progoitrin or 2-hydroxy-3-butenyl glucosinolate. The unstable isothiocyanate (2-hydroxy-3-butenyl isothiocyanate) derived from the latter glucosinolate spontaneously cyclizes to goitrin, because the hydroxy group is situated in proximity to the isothiocyanate group (allowing a five-membered ring to be formed). Hence, the oxygen in the molecule stems from the hydroxy group of the original unstable isothiocyanate. Plants containing this specific glucosinolate (or glucosinolates such as glucobrassicin and sinalbin which liberate thiocyanate ion) have goitrogenic potential due to the goitrin and thiocyanate they contain.

It runs roughly parallel to Jerome Avenue, the Major Deegan Expressway, and University Avenue. Sedgwick Avenue is one of the longest streets in the western part of the Bronx, running from Mosholu Parkway at the north to Macombs Dam Bridge at its southern end, about 800 feet (250 m) west of Yankee Stadium. A smaller Sedgwick Avenue continues into Yonkers, north of Van Cortlandt Park and east of the Saw Mill River Parkway. History From the early 20th century until the 1970s, Sedgwick Avenue is one of the busiest thoroughfares in the Bronx, having streetcars, buses, and train stations. In around 1900, it was a popular road for weekend bicycle tours and military marches to Van Cortlandt Park.Henry Mitchell MacCracken, The Hall of Fame: being the official book authorized by the New York University senate as a statement of the origin and constitution of the Hall of Fame, and of its history up to the close of the year 1900, p. 73 (G.P.

Morris Heights, Bronx is adjacent to this section of the avenue. It splits northeast and becomes two-way at around West Tremont Avenue; Roberto Clemente State Park is at this intersection, and the University Woods, overlooking the Harlem River, a small wood land crested between Sedgwick and Cedar Avenues, is also nearby. Along this stretch, the Putnam Line had a station at Sedgwick Avenue. The NYPD's Strategic Response Group 2 stationhouse is located on Sedgwick Avenue at 169th Street. Sedgwick Avenue remains a primary thoroughfare through University Heights and Kingsbridge Heights; ZIP codes include 10463, 10467, and 10468. The Sedgwick Avenue station was a train station on the abandoned section of the IRT Ninth Avenue Line from 1918 until 1958.

Moshe Shalit, the president, is seated in the first row, fifth from the left. Moshe Shalit, also Moses, Moyshe, Moish√©, Mo√Øs√© Salitas, Szalit, ◊û◊©◊î ◊©◊ê◊ú◊ô◊ò [b. December 22, 1885, Vilna, Russia (present-day Vilnius, Lithuania), d. July 19, 1941, Wilno, Poland (present-day Vilnius, Lithuania)], was a researcher, journalist, essayist, ethnographer, and humanist of the inter-war period. Shalit devoted himself to the promotion of Yiddish language and of literature in a spirit of openness and intercultural exchange. Shalit was an active member of the Jewish Scientific Institute, YIVO, which became the Yiddish Institute for Jewish Research. He was murdered by the Nazis in one of the large massacres in Wilno.Henri Minczeles. Vilna, Wilno, Vilnius, la J√©rusalem de Lituanie. La D√©couverte et Syros, 2000. Pages 375-390. Youth Growing up without a father, Shalit quickly became a recognized cultural activist in the Jewish socialist movement. He attended college several years in Koenigsburg. While he was arrested on several times and was a victim of police repression, he did not quit his studies. In fact, he devoted himself to his overflowing creative activity.H. Minczeles, p. 286. During the First World War, he worked with several newspapers in Vilna. He wrote monographs, book reviews and articles in many Yiddish language publications, which were abundant at the beginning of the 20th century. Shalit travelled greatly; in 1914 he went to America, continuing to publish and spending a lot of his effort in the social-educational domain. During the German occupation, he founded a Yiddish-language Jewish school. Among other responsibilities, he was administrator of the people's university, and president of the Historical Commission. In 1918, he became general secretary of the committee for organising the first democratic Jewish assembly in Vilna.Leben, artistic and literary review founded by Shalit, VII-VIII. December 1920. The Russian Jewish writer and ethnographer S. Anski was a member of the steering committee. However, antisemitism raged. On April 19, 1919, the Polish Army (joined by volunteers) penetrated Vilna to restore Polish supremacy relative to the Russo-Soviets and to some extent the Germans. Vilna, whose status was unclear, was faced this with difficulty. The armed groups took control quickly and began a systematic program of violence against the city's Jewish population including razing, savage attacks, torture and killings. When calm was restored, the \\"wise men\\" of the community, including Shalit (then 34 years old), were called together to re-establish peace in people's minds.Abramowicz, Hirsz. Profiles of a Lost World: Memoirs of East European Jewish Life Before World War II. Wayne State University Press, 1999. . Wilno, center of Jewish intellectual life The inter-war period was marked by Polish domination, and Vilna became Wilno. For many years, Shalit was to be a pillar of Wilno cultural life. He was general secretary of YEKOPO (an aid organisation for Jewish victims of war). He was also member of the ORT (the professional teaching organisation) and the OSE (a child protection organisation focused more and more during this period on disadvantaged Jewish children).Encyclop√©die Judaica, p. 523-525. These two organisations existed the whole time. Studies by Shalit on prominent Yiddish writers such as Mendele Mocher Sforim, Sholem Aleichem, Isaac Leib Peretz and Daniel Bergelson appeared in collection. Wilno became the beacon of Jewish intellectual life, invigorated by the sheer diversity of its characters: from Hebraists, expert Biblical commentators and disciples of the Gaon to Marxist theorists, Yiddish language militants, Trotskyist dissidents and the anti-Zionist socialists of the Bund. In 1925, the fame of Wilno was such that the linguist Max Weinreich and the philosopher Zelig Kalmanovich established themselves there and were at the origin of a major cultural event, the creation of a Jewish Scientific Institute with a largely cultural calling, the YIVO. Academy and university at the beginning, it felt obliged additionally to welcome all those who, through their work, had participated in the spreading of Yiddish culture. The figurehead was Weinrich. Zalman Reisen, philologist and great Yiddish propagandist, set to work making the known the goals of the institution. The most modernist intellectuals of Wilno passed on news of the project. Among them, Shalit was called to join the research groups.Zalman Reisen, Lexique de Litt√©rature, Presse et Philologie juives, 2nd ed., vol. 4. Editions B. Kleckin, Wilno. p. 1927-29. YIVO quickly took on an international dimension; offices were opened in Warsaw, Berlin and New York City. Correspondents covered about 15 countries. Albert Einstein and Sigmund Freud associated themselves with it. The Jewish Cultural and Scientific Institute (YIVO) Four departments were created within the institute: #History #Philology and Literature #Economics and Statistics (Shalit's department) #Psychology and Education.Encyclop√©die Judaica. YIVO, Volume 16, pp. 837-839. In 1936, after a large amount of work and numerous investigations, YIVO established the laws and conventions for describing the Yiddish language. Furthermore, research was to be conducted by the most modern methods and most recent innovations of the human and social scientists into a better understanding of the Jewish identity. The researchers published in Yiddish, English, German and Polish. Statistics was at that time a new science in Jewish culture; Shalit was one of the closest collaborators of Max Weinreich.H. Minczeles, p. ? Shalit's ethnographic studies outside the Economy and Statistics department referred to the situation of the Jews of Poland and the recent past. Shalit was, beyond this, a permanent collaborator of the most important literary journal, \\"Literary pages\\" which was circulated in Warsaw. In 1935, a complete work devoted to Wilno, in which Shalit participated, was published in New York. The following years, his collaboration with various literary journals such as \\"Jewish World\\" and \\"The World Of Books\\", continued. Shalit played a role in all the secular, cultural and social Jewish authorities in Wilno, and more significantly in Poland, and in all the representative institutions in New York, Berlin, Paris and Switzerland where YIVO was to be represented, and in PEN club congresses in which he was an active member.Collectif, Biographical dictionary of modern yiddish literature, Volume 8. An open view of the world Shalit was a polyglot, as were most YIVO members. There was no conflict for these people between the discovery of the world in its diversity and describing and protecting Yiddish culture. In 1938, Shalit published an important work of research with the Almanac of the Wilno Yiddish Writers' and Journalists' Union for the celebration of the Union's 20th anniversary. The first part described the socialist direction of the association and retraced its steps since foundation. The second part was devoted to literary texts, notably those of the Yung Viln√® literary group and many articles reflecting on diverse socio-cultural subjects.. Lituanie juive (1918-1940): Message d‚Äôun monde englouti. Editions Autrement, 1996. Pages 230-231. In the same year, Shalit was president of the Union of Yiddish Language Writers and Journalists. Recognition of the Jewish identity as a cultural phenomenon was important to Shalit. At that time in Wilno, there were 70,000 Jews, almost half the city's population. Philosophers, poets, artists, scientists, political militants, artisans, and shopkeepers all spoke Yiddish‚Äîand not just exclusively in the Jewish area around Zydowska and Straszuna streets. In this fertile environment, YIVO's intellectual activity was at its highest point. It has been estimated that, before the Second World War, there were approximately 11 million Yiddish-speakers in Europe and the two principal destinations for immigration, the United States and South America. YIVO linguists, philologists, lexicographers and grammarians studied the Yiddish language. Specialists considered Lithuanian Yiddish, spoken in Wilno, to be the most literary dialect of Yiddish. Members of YIVO (particularly Shalit) viewed Judaism foremost as a culture‚Äîrather than a religion. As with all cultures, Judaism's foundations were assumed to be spiritual. YIVO's researchers were not preoccupied with making it religious. The destruction of Yiddishland and the fate of its culture During the Second World War, the Nazi authorities solicited Shalit to sit on the Judenrat, the consultative committee designed by the occupiers and formed of prominent Jews from the city's two Jewish Ghettos. Shalit refused; his antifascist militant past seemed to him incompatible with membership. In the middle of the night on July 29, 1941, the Gestapo arrested Shalit at his home on 15 Pohulanka Street (now called Basanaviciaus Street in modern Vilnius, Lithuania), a street also home to novelist Romain Gary and YIVO founder Max Weinreich. Shalit was one of the victims of the Ponary massacre,http://www.holocaustresearchproject.org/einsatz/ponary.html which took place eight kilometres southwest of Vilna. The bodies of 70,000 executed Jews were thrown into ditches in the forest of Ponar. Shalit's wife Deborah and their youngest daughter Ita were killed several months later in Belorussia where they had fled. The Holocaust extended throughout Europe; Yiddishland was to be wiped out. Nonetheless, Yiddish texts were saved from the destruction. Although Yiddish has few speakers, its readers and translators are gathering anew. Shalit's work to promote Yiddish culture continues into the 21st century. Works of Moshe Shalit Note: The works of Moshe Shalit are primarily written in Yiddish.

Lenore Lake) is located in Grant County, Washington. It is a 1,670-acre (680 ha) lake formed by the Missoula Floods in the lower Coulee just north of the town of Soap Lake, Washington. It is situated between Alkali Lake to the north and Soap Lake to the south. The lake is rather narrow, but long. The length of the lake runs north‚Äìsouth alongside Washington State Route 17 leading from near the city of Soap Lake to Coulee City, Washington. Lenore Canyon is a coulee associated with the development of the Scablands. One of the interesting areas around Lake Lenore is the Lenore Caves. Located at the northern end of the lake, the Lenore Caves are a series of overhangs along the cliffs at the lake. They exist in one of the largest volcanic regions on Earth.  Lenore Caves  The Lenore Caves were formed by the plucking of basalt from the walls of the coulees by the Missoula floods and are geologically different from most caverns. They were later used as shelters by prehistoric humans. On Washington State Route 17 along Lake Lenore is a turn- off that leads to a parking area at the beginning of a trail. There is a sign with information about the caves and a general history of the area. There are seven caves accessible by well-maintained trails leading to the caves scattered about the eastern wall of the Grand Coulee across from Lake Lenore.

The regulation is one of many implementing the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969NEPA 42 USC 4321 et seq (1976) and it sets out the formal procedure a US government agency must follow when confronted with gaps in relevant information or scientific uncertainty about significant adverse effects on the environment from a major federal action. Synopsis The regulation requires an agency to make known when it is confronted with gaps in relevant information or scientific uncertainty. The agency then must determine if the missing information is essential to a reasoned choice among the alternatives. When the missing information is material to the decision an agency ordinarily must obtain the information and include it in an environmental impact statement (EIS). If the means for obtaining the missing information are beyond the state of the art or alternatively if the costs of obtaining it are exorbitant the agency must then prepare a worst-case analysis. In this analysis the agency must weigh the need for the action against the risks and in the face of uncertainty. The agency also is to indicate the probability or improbability of the worst case's occurrence.

JAY ALDERS: In Lakewood, NJ, about 12 or so miles from the beaches of Jersey.\\" Alders was raised near the Jersey Shore in Howell Township, New Jersey. This environment provided an early-childhood influence for beach culture. Alders openly attributes surfing as one of his artistic inspirations. Alders attended Montclair State University and earned a bachelor's degree in art in 1996. At Montclair State University Alders was a member and co-founder of the Gamma Mu Chapter of Theta Xi fraternity and illustrator for the Montclarion college newspaper. According to his website, Alders' stylistic influences include Salvador Dal√≠, M.C. Escher and Ingres, among others. Career and cultural impact Although Alders drew and painted since childhood, it was not until his mid-20s that he started displaying his work at regional art shows. In November 2007, Alders toured Brazil with musicians Donavon Frankenreiter, G Love, and Matt Costa as part of the Billabong-sponsored Mostra Festival AlmaSurf. The tour also included surf artists Celine Chat, Sean Davey, and other prominent personalities in the surf-entertainment industry. The tour helped push Alders' work into the global market, landing his artwork in art galleries, on skateboards and surfboards and television, including Fuel TV. In 2008, dietary supplement company Emergen-C used Alders' artwork for a new packaging design, with a portion of the proceeds donated to the Surfrider Foundation. In February 2009, Alders designed musician and pro surfer Donavon Frankenreiter's Limited Edition Tour Poster. This modified version of Alders' painting, Rio Jam, was released during Frankenreiter's winter/spring 2009 West Coast tour. Alders contributions to Frankenreiter also included the artwork on his custom acoustic guitar and a flip book animation for Frankenreiter's guest edition of Surfer Magazine, published November, 2008. Alders' artwork was used as a surfboard design for the first time in early 2009. His art piece Left Behind the Wall was shaped and distributed by 9Fish Surfboards. New Jersey-based reggae band Echo Movement used Alders' painting Burning Inspiration as the cover artwork for their 2009 release, In The Ocean. Australian based Peter Dixon Band featured the Alders painting Home Slice as the album art for their 2011 release Long Way Home. Reggae band Echo Movement featured Alders' painting Star Crossed on their 2012 release Love and The Human Outreach. Acoustic musician Gabe Gomez released his album \\"In My Island\\" in 2012 which features Alders' painting Sea Zen of Tranquility. In 2012, Bermuda born reggae musician Mishka featured Alders' painting Out of the Blue on his album Ocean Is My Potion. On August 24, 2013, Alders hosted a solo art show at Manasquan's historic Algonquin Theatre featuring much of Alders' original surf art as well as his other genres of work. Following the art show, Alders shared the stage with blues music icon G Love; Alders painted during G Love's solo performance. In 2014, Alders linked up with friend Stefan Lessard, bassist of the Dave Matthews Band, to illustrate a setlist from the band's June 14, 2014 show in Camden, New Jersey by request of Lessard. In 2016, Alders was commissioned by Slightly Stoopid to create four art tour posters for their international music tours. In 2016, Santa Cruz, California based musicians The Expendables commissioned Alders for a T-shirt design. The Expendables also performed several live shows while Alders did live painting in Philadelphia and Asbury Park, New Jersey. In October 2016, Alders collaborated with Rock Climbing World Champion Sasha DiGiulian to create a painting inspired by her. In July 2017, Alders released a limited edition tour poster for the band 311 and their Asbury Park, New Jersey show at The Stone Pony. In July 2018, the band Slightly Stoopid released their new album \\"Everyday Life, Everyday People\\" which features an original Jay Alders surf art painting on the Album cover which is inspired by the band's hometown surf break Sunset Cliffs, San Diego. On October 10, 2018, Jay Alders and his wife Chelsea Alders, launched a podcast, The Shifting Perceptions Podcast:Inspiration for a Creative Lifestyle.url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/shifting-perceptions- podcast-inspiration-to-live-more/id1438321207?mt=2  Charity work In 2009 Alders was named an official SurfAid International Ambassador for his dedicated philanthropic work for the organization. After Hurricane Sandy hit the Jersey Shore in October 2012, Alders took to action to help his home state. He was featured on Actions News Jax to cover his philanthropic support efforts. Alders helped organize donation drop off points and helped fill trucks with donations. In November 2012, Alders designed a charity hoodie and t-shirt design which he sold on his website with 100% of the profits going towards Rebuild Recover, a local grass roots Hurricane Sandy non-profit to benefit Hurricane Sandy relief efforts. As of mid-2013, over $15,000 in support was donated from this campaign. In May 2016, Alders was named one of the 2016 Honorees for Hometown Heroes for his dedicated work raising money and awareness for the organization.

Szilard had played a leading role in the Manhattan Project, and in the story he imagines the kind of show trial he might have had if he had been prosecuted in a manner similar to the Nuremberg Trials. Szilard drafted the letter Albert Einstein signed, to Franklin Roosevelt, suggesting the US develop the military uses of nuclear power. The story is set after World War II, shortly after the United States surrendered to the Soviet Union following a sneak attack using germ warfare. Szilard is offered a choice: He can volunteer to work on scientific projects in the Soviet Union, or he can remain in the United States, and stand trial as a war criminal for his role in the development and use of the first atomic bombs during the Second World War. Szilard chooses to stand trial. During his trial the record of his opposition to dropping the atomic bomb on civilian targets is dismissed, on the grounds that he had drafted classified documents where he may have taken the opposite position, and he is convicted. Szilard is allowed to attend the trials of United States President Harry S. Truman, Secretary of War Henry Stimson, and the Secretary of State. Truman's attorney tries to argue that Truman's order for the use of atomic bombs on Japan was no more of a war crime than the Soviet use of biological weapons that led to the American surrender had been. Truman's tribunal convicts him of a violation of laws and customs of war, because, prior to 1945, it had not been customary to drop atomic bombs on cities. When the story was published in the 1961 edition of Szilard's collection, The Voice of the Dolphins, and Other Stories, the book stated that the story was required reading for students at Harvard Law School. According to William Lanouette speaking at the World Science Forum, in Budapest, in 2005 a Russian language translation of Szilard's story played a key role in Soviet physicist Andrei Sakharov's objections to the Soviet nuclear weapons program.

According to The Dallas Morning News, a witness who saw the robber prior to his putting on the mask described the robber's features to police, who created a sketch that was widely distributed.

Agents from the FBI Bank Robbery Task Force identified de la Garza as the \\"Mesh Mask Bandit\\", who was believed to have been involved in nearly 20 bank robberies since December 2012. De la Garza's wife and people who worked with him expressed shock at the arrest, although others who know him stated that de la Garza had a gambling addiction.

The comic was created by writer Joe Kelly and artist Max Fiumara and chronicles a revenge story set in Brooklyn, NYC. As Joe Kelly states, Four Eyes is about \\"a boy who‚Äôs trying to get back at a gang that‚Äôs directly responsible for his dad‚Äôs death...the world in which they live is a world where underground dragon fighting is entertainment for the masses.\\"Brady, Matt: Joe Kelly on Four Eyes, Newsarama, June 17, 2008. The title, Four Eyes comes from the name given to the dragon which befriends Enrico, the young boy who is the center character of the story. The neglected and deformed runt of a dragon which has four eyes and is not able to use them efficiently, thus making it not very suitable for fighting. Publication history The concept for Four Eyes first came to Kelly several years ago, and began with a simple image in his head. ‚ÄúA boy with a dragon on a chain in front of an old car,‚Äù said the writer, ‚Äúlike a Studebaker or old Ford - and the Brooklyn Bridge in the background. He didn't have any shoes on, and I thought it was the Great Depression. I didn't know what it meant, really, but all of a sudden, the idea of a revenge story kicked in, the struggles of the Depression and how people needed things to keep their minds off of their troubles; illegal gambling; and that dragon? Dragon fighting? That's sort of it, an image blossoming.‚Äù A Boy & His Dragon: Kelly talks \\"Four Eyes\\", Comic Book Resources, June 26, 2008 Plot Kelly has designed Four Eyes as an epic story to be told in a series of arcs. In the first year, Kelly said, readers will learn \\"what happens to Enrico's dad and how a little boy learns about the dark underbelly of his father's other life. We‚Äôll see his first dragon hunt and how he ultimately gets Four Eyes. Then, the long road to training his dragon - what a kid has to do to hide this very illegal animal, work with it, and turn it into a killer.

It is a European style call option with a low exercise price of $0.01 and a contract size of 100 shares to be delivered on exercise. The premium is close to the whole share price, and a trader only posts margin, not the full price. Both the buyer and the seller are margined, all positions are marked-to-market daily. LEPOs work like a futures contract. History The Australian Stock Exchange started listing LEPO exchange traded options in 1995 to allow traders to trade underlying shares on margin. In 2018, there are 100 ASX listed companies that offer LEPO contracts. Differences from standard options Several important differences distinguish LEPOs from standard exchange-traded options, and these differences have important implications for the pricing of LEPO. * The buyer of a LEPO does not pay the full amount of the premium upfront. * Both buyer and seller of LEPOs involve ongoing margin payments. * The buyer of a LEPO does not receive dividends or obtain voting rights on the underlying shares until the shares are transferred after exercise. * LEPOs are only available as call options. * LEPOs have a very low exercise price and a high premium close to the initial value of the underlying shares. * LEPOs have only one exercise price per expiry month. LEPOs may be over either shares or an index. Pricing of Low Exercise Price Options The current value of a contract is equal to the current price of the underlying share compounded by the risk-free interest rate, less the accumulated value of any dividends, less the exercise price of $0.01. :L _ {0, 1} = S _ 0 e ^ {r (n/365)} - D e ^ {r(n-y)/365} - X where: *L _ {0, 1} = price of LEPO contract entered into at time 0 for delivery at time 1; *S _ 0 = price of underlying share at time 0; *r = risk-free rate of return; *n = number of days until contract maturity; *D = value of share dividends; *y = number of days until dividend is paid. *X = exercise price (equals $0.01); To prove that above formula is correct, we'll calculate price using Black‚ÄìScholes formula. The Black‚ÄìScholes formula after modifications to recognize that the premium is paid at the expiry of the contract: :L_{0, 1} = [S _ 0 N(d _ 1) - X e ^ {-rn/365}N(d _ 2)] e ^{rn/365} where: N(d) is cumulative probability distribution function for a standard normal distribution. :d _ 1 = \\\\dfrac {\\\\ln(S _ 0/X) + (r + {\\\\sigma ^ 2} / 2)(n/365) } { \\\\sigma \\\\sqrt { n/365 } } :d _ 2 = d _ 1 - \\\\sigma \\\\sqrt { n/365 } For a LEPO an underlying price S_0 is very big compare to exercise price X. Because of that N(d_1) is very close to 1, with insignificant difference. Thus LEPO price per Black‚ÄìScholes formula (without dividend) is :L_{0, 1} = S_0 e^{rn/365} - X and it matches our previous formula. References # Stephen A. Easton, Sean M.

As the first African American Ph.D in anthropology, and the only one until after the Korean War,Harrison and Harrison, 1999. African-American Pioneers in Anthropology. New York: University of Illinois Press. his main focus in the anthropological discipline was studying the idea of race and its negative impact on communities of color. His career both as a physician and a professor at Howard University was dedicated to the advancement of African American researchers and he was heavily involved in civil rights activism. Cobb wrote prolifically and contributed both popular and scholarly articles during the course of his career. His work has been noted as a significant contribution to the development of the sub-discipline of biocultural anthropology during the first half of the 20th Century. Cobb was also an accomplished educator and taught over 5000 students in the social and health sciences during his lifetime.  Early and personal life  Cobb was born on October 12, 1904, in Washington DC. His mother, Alexizne Montague Cobb grew up in Massachusetts and is partly of Native American descent. His father, William Elmer Cobb, grew up in Selma, Alabama. His parents met in Washington DC when his father started his own printing business for the Black community. The tipping point for Cobb's initial interest in Anthropology came from a book of the animal kingdom that his grandfather owned. In this book, there were illustrations of human beings separated by race, but were illustrated with what Cobb called \\"equal dignity.\\" This led to an interest in the concept of race, as the same type of \\"equal dignity\\" was not granted in the society that surrounded Cobb's life. Cobb attended Dunbar High School, a highly esteemed Washington, DC. African American high school in 1917. He was a successful student and athlete, and went on to win championships in cross- country as well as lightweight and welterweight boxing during his high school and collegiate years. He married Hilda B. Smith, Ruth Smith Lloyd's sister, and they had two children. Cobb died of pneumonia on November 20, 1990 at the age of 86.  Education  Following his graduation from Dunbar High School in 1921, Cobb earned his Bachelor of Arts from Amherst College in 1925. Following completion of his baccalaureate degree, he received a Blodgett Scholarship for proficiency in biology which allowed him to pursue research in embryology at Woods Hole Marine Biology Laboratory. He earned his MD (Doctor of Medicine) in 1929 from the Howard University Medical School. He worked jobs throughout his time in medical school. Cobb then accepted a position at Howard University which he was offered prior to his graduation. Numa P.G. Adams, who was the Dean of Howard University at the time, was assigned the task of organizing a new faculty of African American physicians to help advance the school in the medical field. Cobb, in turn had the aspirations of creating a laboratory of anatomy and physical anthropology at Howard University that would have the resources for African American scholars to contribute to debates in racial biology. As a part of Dean Adams' efforts, Cobb was sent to study under biological anthropologist T. Wingate Todd at Case Western Reserve University. Cobb's dissertation work was an expansive survey of the Hamann-Todd Skeletal Collection, a large skeletal population now housed at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History which is associated with Case Western Reserve University. He earned his Ph.D in Anthropology in 1932 and his dissertation was published under the title Human Archives the following year.  Career  Following the conferral of his doctorate, Cobb remained at Case Western Reserve University as a fellow, where he continued work on the Hamman-Todd Collection with a focus on cranial suture closure. His 1940 publication \\"Cranio-Facial Union in Man\\" produced as a result of this work established his expertise as a functional anatomist and is one of his most widely cited works to date. During this period, Cobb also worked with physical anthropologist Ale≈° Hrdliƒçka on a survey of the skeletal collection at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC. He returned to the Howard University Medical School in 1930 where he taught for the majority of his career and established the W. Montague Cobb Skeletal Collection. He became the university's first distinguished professor in 1969 and became professor emeritus in 1973. In addition to his work at Howard, Cobb also taught at Stanford University, the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, the University of Washington, the University of Maryland, West Virginia University, Harvard Medical School, the Medical College of Wisconsin at Milwaukee, and the Catholic University of America during his lifetime. Cobb was heavily involved with a number of anthropological and medical organizations during his career. He was an active member of the American Association of Physical Anthropologists since its second meeting in 1930 and served on its board on multiple occasions, both as its vice president (from 1948‚Äì50 and from 1954‚Äì56) and president (from 1957‚Äì59). He also held leadership roles with the Anthropological Society of Washington, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Eugenics Society, and the Medico-Chirurgical Society of the District of Columbia. He also served as chairman on the Council of Medical Education and Hospitals for two terms (1948‚Äì63). Throughout his lifetime Cobb pursued work aimed at furthering the opportunities of African Americans both within society in general and within the health sciences. He was an active member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and served as its president from 1976‚Äì1982. He created the Imhotep Conferences on Hospital Integration in 1957 as a part of the NAACP, an annual conference seeking to end hospital and medical school segregation that continued until 1964. He was an active member of the National Medical Association, an organization dedicated to the advancement of African American physicians and other health professionals. He was a longtime contributor to its journal, the Journal of the National Medical Association, to which he served as editor from 1944 to his death in 1990. He also served as the organization's president from 1964‚Äì65. In addition to his involvement in both African American and European American-led professional organizations and journals, Cobb was active in community outreach through work on race and health published in popular African American magazines such as Negro Digest, Pittsburgh Courier, and Ebony.  Scholarship  Throughout his career, Cobb applied his technical expertise in functional anatomy and medicine to a variety of topics, including the issues of African American health, child development, and disproving scientific justifications for racism. His approach has been characterized as a form of applied anthropology and activist scholarship. His work explicitly critiqued hierarchical understandings of human variation, and he often subverted racist evolutionary arguments through highlighting the resiliency of African Americans. He took as an example the experience of the Transatlantic slave trade which he argued acted as a selective pressure and would have led to a genetically stronger population relative to European Americans who did not experience this population bottleneck. Cobb often used his expertise in anatomy and biology in order to combat racist explanations for perceived differences between African Americans and European Americans. One of the most widely cited studies in this effort was Cobb's \\"Race and Runners,\\" published in 1936. In this work, Cobb took the case of Jesse Owens to dispel the idea that his success as a quadruple gold medal winner could be explained by his \\" African American genes,\\" an argument that stemmed from the idea that black people were stronger and more athletic than whites at the cost of decreased intelligence. Proponents of this idea often pointed to the supposed existence of extra musculature or differences in nerve thicknesses that allowed African American athletes to excel relative to European Americans. Cobb addressed this question by surveying the anatomical characteristics of Owens as well as other prominent African Americans in different sports. Cobb demonstrated that not only could their successes not be explained by a shared racial trait, the physiology that would make a superior athlete in one sport would be very different from another. Instead, Cobb accounted for the achievements of African American athletes relative to European Americans in sports as due to \\"training and incentive\\" rather than any \\"special physical endowment\\". During the latter years of his career, Cobb took a more philosophical approach to his anatomical perspective of humanity. He often used biological metaphors to point to key issues within society. Cobb's most prominent philosophical contribution was arguably his 1975 publication, \\"An anatomist's view of human relations. Homo sanguinis versus Homo sapiens--mankind's present dilemma\\". This work focused primarily on the fundamental conflict in human nature he described as being between the civilized people suggested by our binomial designation Homo sapiens (\\"Man the Wise\\") and the much older and violent organism he described via his coined term Homo sanguinus (\\"Man the bloody\\"). Cobb described the recent \\"adaptations\\" of civilization and ethics as similar to recently evolved anatomical traits like bipedalism, a key human trait which has nonetheless resulted in a host of health conditions due to our lineage's adaptations for quadrupedal locomotion. Cobb argued that man the wise is up against the ancient evolutionary tradition of man as a \\"bloody, predatory primate\\" and that this history of violence and hatred will thus be difficult to overcome. Cobb's final presented publication in 1988, \\"Human Variation: Informing the Public,\\" applied his Homo sanguinus more closely to the rapid cultural change of the late 20th Century. Cobb saw this period of rapid development as both a key opportunity for continued progress against racism and other forms of inequality and a potential for such issues to become more firmly embedded within the system of the society: \\"Just as an embryological defect cannot be corrected, so our mammoth construction programs can be wrong, which is not obvious until it is too late.\\"  Legacy  Cobb distinguished himself by representing the pursuit of social responsibility in the field of anthropology, as well as by being an activist scholar who often applied anthropological methods to issues of racism and inequality. He undertook studies within the scope of his expertise in anatomy that aimed at disproving racist explanations for social difference.He believed that scholars must take responsibility \\"not only for their own thoughts and actions but also for their own society\\" because the values that are expressed in scientific work, whether subtly or overtly, are key in the shaping of culture and society. He was one of the first anthropologist to undertake a demographic analysis that illustrated the consequences of segregation and racism on the African American population, and he wanted to create the resources so he would not be the last. One of Cobb's greatest contributions to this end is the expansive skeletal collection he curated during his time at Howard University which is now housed at the university's W. Montague Cobb Research Laboratory, a research laboratory led by biological anthropologist Fatimah Jackson that also houses the New York African Burial Ground collection. Cobb was long involved in African descendants' struggle for freedom, justice, and equality. He assumed a number of roles in African American-led organizations, including the National Urban League and the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History, and he was a longtime editor of the first African American medical journal, the Journal of the National Medical Association. He was a member of the board of directors for the NAACP from 1949 until his death and president from 1976 to 1982. Cobb played a key role in efforts to expand access to medical care through his active leadership in the National Medical Association, and this activism led to his testimony to congress during the hearings leading up to the passage of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965. He was present at the signing of this bill into law by invitation of President Lyndon B. Johnson. During his lifetime, Cobb was honored by over 100 organizations for his efforts as a scholar and as an activist, including the American Association of Anatomy's highest award, the Henry Gray Award, which he received for his outstanding contributions in the field in 1980. He was also the recipient of the U.S. Navy's Distinguished Public Service Award and received honorary doctorates from several institutions, including the Medical College of Wisconsin, Georgetown University, the University of the Witwatersrand, Morgan State University, Howard University, and Amherst College.  Publications  A few of Cobb's most celebrated works were the following: * \\"Human Archives\\" ‚Äì 1932. * \\"Race and Runners\\" ‚Äì1936. *\\"Cranio Facial Union of Man\\" ‚Äì 1940. * \\"The Cranio-Facial Union and the Maxillary Tuber in Mammals\\" ‚Äì 1943. * ‚ÄúMedical Care and the Plight of the Negro in Medicine‚Äù ‚Äì 1947. * \\"An anatomist's view of human relations.

During her lifetime she became a versatile writer who produced over forty novels, some of which found a large reading public.Cork Examiner 30 Jan 1963, ObituaryIrish Times 30 Jan 1963, Obituary She preferred to be known as Mrs Victor Richard to avoid association with a young woman called Jessie Rickard, who was brutally murdered in an incident reported in the media as 'The Cornish Tragedy'Berks & Oxon Advertiser, 24 June 1904 Early life She was born in Dublin as Jessica Louisa Moore, younger daughter of Canon Courtenay Moore M.A., V.P.R.S.A.I. (1842‚Äì1922), then rector of Castletownroch and later of Brigown, Mitchelstown, co.

They were so popular that she followed with a hunting story, The Price of a Friend, which was accepted as a series by the Irish Times. She married Robert Dudley Innes Ackland, by whom she had a daughter, and later divorced him, which caused a rift with her father. Literary career The Last General Absolution of the Munsters at Rue du Bois by Matania. It depicts Victor Rickard mounted on the left Not until 1912 however, when already aged 36, did she publish her first novel, Young Mr. Gibbs, a light and humorous work. Her next book, Dregs, which appeared in 1914, was a psychological study and was the forerunner of many romantic and sometimes sensational tales marked by great vitality. The word powerful can justly be applied to them and all had evocative titles: The Dark Stranger, Blindfold, Yesterdays Love, Old Sins Have Long Shadows, and A Reckless Puritan. She had married Lieut. Colonel Victor Rickard, a professional officer of the 2nd Battalion Royal Munster Fusiliers who featured prominently in the painting The Last Absolution of the Munsters by the war artist Matania, which depicts the second battalion of the Munsters halting at a wayside shrine at \\"Rue du Bois\\" on the eve of the Battle of Aubers Ridge in May 1915, in which Rickard, who led the regiment, was to die with many of his comrades. Now widowed and with a son to support, she reverted to writing as a source of income. She first published The Story of the Munsters (1915) which provided the subject for this well-known Matania picture commissioned by her, depicting the Chaplain of the Munsters, Father Francis Gleeson, giving the Munsters their last absolution. She also published a series of articles in New Ireland during 1915 entitled The Irish at the Front, in which New Ireland claimed several soldiers received medals as a result.Maume, Patrick: The long Gestation, Irish Nationalist Life 1891‚Äì1918, p.155, Gill & Macmillan (1999) Prolific writer Beginning with Young Mr Gibbs (1911) to Shandon Hall (1950) she wrote over forty novels ranging in genre from light comedy to detective novels which earned her a living as a popular novelist. With a widening reputation, and together with Dorothy Sayers, G. K. Chesterton, Fr. Ronald Knox and others she was a founder member of the Detective Writers' Club. Having moved to England for some years, she was received into the Catholic Church in 1925 by Rev. Joseph Leonard C.M. who at that time was stationed with the Vincentians at Strawberry Hill, London. Most of her novels were published under the name \\"Mrs Victor Rickard\\", but she also achieved a reputation with others, as the author of The Pointing Man. Later life Illness and publishing difficulties due to the war brought an end to her industrious output. She came to live at Lower Montenotte in Cork city in 1948 where she wrote her last novel. She made her charming house a salon to which it was always delightful to be invited. It attracted a wide range of interesting people. Mrs. Rickard was a witty woman and a delightful hostess; kind to the young; invariably hospitable; a vivid personality. She was a close friend of Lady Hazel Lavery (1880‚Äì1935) who was the subject of her novel A Bird of Strange Plumage (1927). A debiliterating stroke in the nineteen-fifties left her paralysed on one side and she taught herself to write with her left hand, with characteristic courage. In her later years, she lived in the Montenotte home of Denis Gwynn whose wife was a daughter of Lady Lavery by her first marriage. She died on 28 January 1963 at the age of 86 and is buried in Rathcooney Cemetery, Greater Cork.Biographical portrait: Jessie Louisa Richard BibliographyNovels= * Young Mr Gibbs (Eveleigh Nash, 1911) * Dregs (Rivers, 1914) * The Light Above the Cross Roads (1916) * The Frantic Boast (Duckworth, 1917) * The Fire of Green Boughs (Duckworth, 1918) * The House of Courage (Duckworth, 1919) * Cathy Rossiter (Hodder & Stoughton, 1919) * A Reckless Puritan (Hodder & Stoughton, 1920) * A Fool's Errand (Hodder & Stoughton, 1921) * Blindfold (Jonathan Cape, 1922) * Without Justification (Jonathan Cape, 1923) * Old Sins have Long Shadows (Constable, 1924) * The Young Man in Question (1924) * A Rebel House.

It was fought on Sunday, 23 September 1798, between forces of the British Crown and a combined force of Irish rebels and a small number of French troops at Killala, County Mayo, Ireland. Background On the day before the battle, the advance of the British army was visible miles from Killala ‚Äì as it was marked by smoke from houses and cabins burned along the route.Stock, p. 135. Prior to the battle, Rebels and refugees began pouring into Killala ‚Äì especially from the direction of Ballina. The morning was marked by heavy rainfall, but this cleared before noon.Stock, p. 142. The French present at the battle included 4 officers only ‚Äì Charoust, Boudet, Ponson and Truc. Truc had arrived on the morning of the battle from Ballina. The battle The main body of Rebels occupied rising ground about a mile outside the town of Killala, on the road to Ballina. They positioned themselves behind low stone walls on each side of the road, which acted as breastworks. Other Rebels were positioned elsewhere near the town, correctly anticipating that the British would split their forces for the attack. The British force approached the town in two divisions, each from a different direction. One of these divisions approached in the direction of where the Rebels were stationed on the Ballina road and a sharp engagement took place when the two sides met. This lasted for about twenty minutes, until the Rebels fled back into the town. They were pursued by the British troops as they did so and, as a result, many Rebels were killed ‚Äì both within the town and in the fields surrounding it. Aftermath Memorial located at the main site of the Battle. The defeat was the last major engagement of the 1798 rebellion. Killala had remained for 32 days in the hands of the Rebels and French. Many Rebels were killed on the day after the battle also, as the army searched the town and surrounding countryside for fugitives. The British forces burned many houses in the area. On both days, a number of innocent civilians and loyalists were also killed.Maxwell, p. 247. The French officers surrendered ‚Äì afterwards they were sent to Dublin, and from there to London. Henry O'Keane, though an officer in the French army,Therefore, there were really 5 French Officers present at the battle ‚Äì if O'Keane is included. was not treated as such when captured. O'Keane was sent to Castlebar, where he was tried by Court martial. He was expelled from and forbidden ever to return to British territories.Stock, pp 71 ‚Äì 74. Courts martial began the day after the battle. The proceedings took place at the house of Owen Morrisson in the town.Stock, p. 75 & p. 164. Two Rebel leaders, Richard Bourke and Captain Bellew, were tried on Monday evening and found guilty. They were executed the next morning in the park behind the castle.Stock, pp 164‚Äì165.Maxwell, p. 251. Another prominent Rebel, Roger MacGuire, was transported to Botany Bay. MacGuire's father was hanged.Stock, p. 166. Courts martial and executions of other Rebels continued for a week.Teeling, p. 230. Seventy-five prisoners were tried at Killala.

Life and careerAV debut and Moodyz= An Nanba was born in Tokyo on March 7, 1984. She says she was very outgoing as a high-school student and looked much older than her age. She had met scouts from the AV industry often but only decided to begin an AV career after she was robbed and needed the money. She had done some gravure model work for Bejean a few months before and she thought she was again doing photographs for a magazine and was shocked when she realized it was a video shoot. The title of her debut video, Number.1!, released in October 2002 by Moodyz when she was 18, is a play on her name (in Japanese name order, Nanba An sounds close to English \\"Number One\\"). Her contract with Moodyz was an exclusive one and she is credited with being a driving force in that studio's success. She continued making movies with Moodyz for the rest of her career at the rate of one or often two videos per month. Although she started in AV work for the money to pay debts, she says she stayed because \\"I realized that my work turned into something of substance\\". She also occasionally made non-AV videos - her non-sex gravure title for Shuffle, Naked / An Nanba, released in July 2003, was filmed in Okinawa. Moodyz is known for its extreme videos and Nanba participated in the various porn genres popular at the studio: bukkake (including two videos with the creator of the genre, Kazuhiko Matsumoto), anal sex, bondage, interracial sex with black actors, urination and simulated rape. The videos took their toll on Nanba, she reports that at one time she collapsed from exhaustion and had to take time off. Nanba was the most celebrated actress at Moodyz during her long career with the studio - she was given the Best Actress Award at the Moodyz Awards three years running, in 2003, 2004 and 2005. Her 2003 videos Digital Mosaic Vol. 11 and Dream School 7 respectively won the top prize Moodyz Award and the Best Sales Award that year and her 2004 work Bukkake Nakadashi Anal Fuck was the recipient of a Special Award. At the 2005 Adult Broadcasting Awards ceremony for adult TV programming in 2004, Nanba took one of the Channel Actress Performance Awards for her work on the Queen Bee channel, =Later career= Starting in October 2005, after more than 50 straight original videos for one company, Nanba began to appear for the first time in videos for other AV studios beginning with start-up companies Opera and Cross.

China states that China's continental shelf in the East China Sea extends to China- Ryukyu Border Trough naturally, which has been over 200 nautical miles away from the mainland baseline of Chinese territorial waters. According to UNCLOS, any country claiming continental shelves beyond 200 nm shall provide relevant scientific evidence to CLCS.

The campus was located approximately 2 miles north of I-10. At its closing, Woodland Hall had 8 teachers and 6 staff members, with a student-to-teacher ratio of 3.6:1.  History  Woodland Hall was founded in 1972 in Charleston, South Carolina, in a rented white schoolhouse, and in 1975 transferred to a church building. In 1977, it moved to Tallahassee. The school was founded by Dr. Patricia K. Hardman, and was first known as the Dyslexia Research Institute. The program started as a summer school for children with learning disabilities and grew into a full-time school. The school closed in 2019 and admitted its last students in 2017.  Students  At its closure, Woodland Hall had 22 students in grades 1-12. Previously, the total number of students ranged from 17 to 50. Many students went on to two- and four-year colleges.  Campus  Woodland Hall is housed in a small school building of seven class rooms, one large room and a library, with the capacity to hold eleven classes at one time. The library holds 8,690 books in all. The grounds include the main school building, two utility buildings, a playground, basketball court and a large field. According to its archived web site (below) the school's buildings were purchased by Celebration Baptist Church, which allowed the school to use a classroom during its final year, 2018‚Äì2019.  Class structure  Woodland Hall implemented a number of special approaches to facilitate learning for dyslexic and ADHD students. Classes were kept small, from one-on-one tutorials up to ten student classes. To help students overcome reading problems, classes used a highly structured teaching method that emphasizes repetition and review. The schedule included a 15-minute period called D.E.A.R. (Drop Everything and Read) Time, where students broke from classes and read, or were read to by teachers. Woodland Hall Academy enforced a medication-free environment. Students were required to be off behavior- modifying medications once they began attending, relying instead on the instructive methods to help students stay on task. The school itself was a sugar-free environment, and students' families were encouraged to regulate their diets at home. Strong scents such as perfumes and colognes wereprohibited at the school for the distractions they posed to the students.  Clubs  Woodland Hall held Club Day on Friday afternoons, including a Games Club, Cooking Club, and Student Council.

Biography Gustav H. Franke was born in Wisconsin and moved to Iowa on September 7, 1888. His father, Gustave Henry Franke, was a tailor in Manning, Iowa. \\"Gus\\" Franke was an honors graduate of the United States Military Academy, class of 1911. He graduated 12th in a class of 83. One of Franke's classmates at West Point was future general Terry Allen, until Allen's academic difficulties led to his dismissal from the military academy. Another distinguished classmate was Walton Walker, who would rise to Lt. General and command the Eighth Army in Korea during the desperate times of 1950. Franke served much of his career in the Field Artillery Branch. Franke was commander of the first US unit (Artillery) to engage the Germany Army in World War I as the American forces moved forward. In the years leading up to World War II, Franke was the commanding officer of the 2nd Field Artillery Regiment from 1937 to 1940. He moved to Commandant of the Field Artillery Replacement Center at Fort Bragg in 1941. From 1941 to 1942, Franke was the commanding officer of Artillery for the 6th Infantry Division. With the advent of the United States involvement in World War II, General Franke became the commander of the 81st Infantry Division at Fort Rucker, Alabama, from its reactivation in June 1942 until August 1942. During this time Gen. Franke was responsible for the construction and establishment of Ft. Rucker as a major facility as the home and training center for the 81st Infantry Division. He was succeeded at the 81st by Maj. General Paul J. Mueller. During the summer of 1943 Franke became ill and was hospitalized for several months in Atlanta, Georgia. Franke was a member of the War Department Dependency Board from 1943 to 1944. Major General Franke retired from the Army in 1944. His son, Gustav H. Franke Jr., was also an army officer and served in World War II and the Korean War where he was awarded a Silver Star. Like his father, he was a career artillery officer, eventually retiring from the Army in 1965. After he completed courses at Duke University, he became a professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia. He also had a son that followed in his grandfather and father's steps. Gustav W. Franke served as an Army Aviator and Engineer officer. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross during the Vietnam War. Later in his career he headed up the United States Department of Defense Key Asset Protection Program during the First Gulf War and retired in 1996 as a Colonel.

This standard requires an electrical panel to provide a physical mechanism to prevent installing more circuit breakers than it was designed for. This has generally been implemented by restricting the use of tandem (duplex) breakers to replace standard single pole breakers. Code Requirement The 1965 edition of the NEC, article 384-15 was the first reference to the circuit total limitation of panelboards. , the location of this language is at Article 408.54 now titled \\"Maximum Number of Overcurrent Devices.\\" Non-CTL panels have not been made by reputable manufacturers since 1965. Though this may change due to the 2008 repeal. Non-CTL for replacement only Circuitboards and panelboards built prior to 1965 did not have circuit total limiting devices or features built-in. To support these old panels, non- CTL circuit breakers that bypass the rejection feature are still sold \\"for replacement use only.\\" As a result, numerous unsafe situations have resulted where panels were dangerously overloaded because these non-CTL breakers continue to be used. With the use of non-CTL breakers, panels can be configured with the total number of circuits in excess of the designed capacity of that panel. The 2008 code did away with the previous 42 circuit limitation on panelboards.See \\"bullet\\" in 2008 NEC between Articles 408.30 and 408.36, where 2005's Article 408.35 appeared.

Cuba's National Art Schools (Escuelas Nacionales de Arte, now known as the Instituto Superior de Arte) are considered by historians to be among the most outstanding architectural achievements of the Cuban Revolution.Loomis, John A., Revolution of Forms - Cuba's Forgotten Art Schools, introduction p. xxiii These innovative, organic Catalan-vaulted brick and terra-cotta structures were built on the site of a former country club in the far western Havana suburb of Cubanac√°n, which was once considered to be Havana's \\"Beverly Hills\\", and was then mainly reserved for Communist Party officials. The schools were conceived and founded by Fidel Castro and Che Guevara in 1961, and they reflect the utopian optimism and revolutionary exuberance of the early years of the Cuban Revolution.Rubin, D. (2000), World Encyclopedia of Contemporary Theatre: The Americas, Taylor & Francis Over their years of active use, the schools served as the primary incubator for Cuba's artists, musicians, actors and dancers. World Monuments Fund video on conservation of the National Schools of Art By 1965, however, the art schools and their architects fell out of favor as Soviet-inspired functionalist forms became standard in Cuba. Additionally, the schools were subjected to accusations that their design was incompatible with the Cuban Revolution. These factors resulted in the schools‚Äô near-complete decommissioning and the departure of two of their three architects. Never fully completed, the complex of buildings lay in various stages of use and abandonment, some parts literally overgrown by the jungle until preservation efforts began in the first decade of the 21st century. The schools‚Äô legacy was eventually brought to light by regional and international architectural journals in the 1980s, piquing the curiosity of observers both internationally and within Cuba through the 1990s. This growing interest reached its apex in 1999 with the publication of the book Revolution of Forms - Cuba's Forgotten Art Schools, by John Loomis, a California-based architect, professor, and author. Following the publication of Revolution of Forms, the schools attracted even greater international attention and in 2000 they were nominated for the World Monuments Fund Watch List. In November 2010, the National Art Schools were officially recognized as national monuments by the Cuban Government, and they are currently being considered for inclusion on the World Heritage list of sites which have \\"outstanding universal value\\" to the world. Cuba's National Art Schools have inspired a series of art installations under the name of Utopia Posible by the Cuban artist Felipe Dulzaides, the documentary film Unfinished Spaces by Alysa Nahmias and Ben Murray, and an opera directed by Robert Wilson entitled Revolution of Forms (named after John Loomis' book) written by Charles Koppleman. Conceptualization In January 1961, the Cuban revolutionary leaders Fidel Castro and Che Guevara, enjoyed a drink after they finished a game of golf at Havana's formerly exclusive Country Club Park, pondered the future of a country club whose members had all fled the country. The Cuban Literacy Campaign had just been launched, and with the inspiration of extending the program's success into a wider cultural arena, Guevara proposed the creation of a complex of tuition-free art schools to serve talented young people from all over the Third World. He conceived of the schools as highly experimental and conceptually advanced to serve the creation of a ‚Äúnew culture‚Äù for the ‚Äúnew man‚Äù. An innovative program called for innovative architecture, and Castro saw the Cuban architect Ricardo Porro as being that architect who could deliver such architecture.Loomis, Revolution of Forms, p.21 Cuba's National Art Schools represented an attempt to reinvent architecture in the same manner that the Cuban Revolution aspired to reinvent society. Through their designs, the architects sought to integrate issues of culture, ethnicity, and place into a revolutionary formal composition hitherto unknown in architecture. Design of the five schools The design of the National Art Schools, created by Ricardo Porro, Roberto Gottardi, and Vittorio Garatti, ran counter to the dominant International Style of the time. The three architects saw the International Style as the architecture of capitalism and sought to recreate a new architecture in the image of the Cuban Revolution. These critiques of modernism existed in a broader context of critique and are considered to be notable additions to the spectrum of innovative architecture from the period. Architects such as Hugo H√§ring, Bruno Zevi, Ernesto Nathan Rogers, and Alvar Aalto, not to mention Frank Lloyd Wright, all practiced on the margins of mainstream modern architecture. For Porro, Gottardi, and Garatti, this international response to modernism mixed with more region-specific expressions of Hispanic and Latin American identity (long after Gaud√≠ but sharing his Catalan influence) in the post-WWII world.Loomis, Revolution of Forms, p.7 The architects set up their design studio on the site of the former country club. They decided that there would be three guiding principles for the design of the art schools. The first principle was that the architecture for the schools would be integrated with the widely varied, unusual landscape of the golf course. The second and third principles were derived from material necessity. The US embargo against Cuba, begun in 1960, had made the importation of rebar and Portland cement very costly. The architects therefore decided to use locally produced brick and terracotta tile, and for the constructive system they would use the Catalan vault with its potential for organic form. When Fidel Castro viewed the plans for the art schools, he praised their design, saying that the complex would be ‚Äúthe most beautiful academy of arts in the whole world‚Äù.Fidel Castro Ruiz, quoted in La mas Hermosa academia de artes de todo el mundo, Noticias de Hoy, 4 May 1963 There were five art schools within the academy: the School of Modern Dance, the School of Plastic Arts, the School of Dramatic Arts, the School of Music, and the School of Ballet. =School of Modern Dance ‚Äì Ricardo Porro= School of Modern Dance, Ricardo Porro Porro conceived the modern dance school's plan as a sheet of glass that had been violently smashed and fragmented into shifting shards, symbolic of the revolution's violent overthrow of the old order.Loomis, Revolution of Forms, p.43 The fragments gather around an entry plaza - the locus of the \\"impact\\" - and develop into an urban scheme of linear, though non-rectilinear, shifting streets and courtyards. The entry arches form a hinge around which the library and administrative bar rotate away from the rest of the school. The south side of the fragmented plaza is defined by rotating dance pavilions, paired around shared dressing rooms. The north edge, facing a sharp drop in terrain, is made by two linear bars, containing classrooms, that form an obtuse angle. At the culmination of the angular procession, farthest from the entry, where the plaza once again compresses is the celebrated form of the performance theater. =School of Plastic Arts ‚Äì Ricardo Porro= School of Plastic Arts, Ricardo Porro The concept for this school is intended to evoke an archetypal African village, creating an organic urban complex of streets, buildings and open spaces. The studios, oval in plan, are the basic cell of the complex. Each one was conceived as a small arena theater with a central skylight to serve students working from a live model. The studios are organized along two arcs, both of which are curving colonnaded paths. Lecture rooms and offices are accommodated in a contrasting blocklike plan that is partially wrapped by and engaged with the colonnaded path. Ideas of gender and ethnicity converge in the curvilinear forms and spaces of Plastic Arts. Most notable is how the organic spatial experience of the curvilinear paseo archetectonico delightfully disorients the user not being able to fully see the extent of the magic realist journey being taken.Loomis, Revolution of Forms, p.65 =School of Dramatic Arts ‚Äì Roberto Gottardi= School of Dramatic Arts, Roberto Gottardi The School of Dramatic Arts is urban in concept, as are Porro's two schools. Dramatic Arts is organized as a very compact, axial, cellular plan around a central plaza amphitheater. Its inward-looking nature creates a closed fortress-like exterior. The amphitheater, fronting the unbuilt theater at what now is the entrance, is the focal point of all the subsidiary functions, which are grouped around it. Circulation takes place in the narrow leftover interstices, open to the sky like streets, between the positive volumes of the masonry cells. Winding more or less concentrically through the complex, circulation negates the axiality and generalized symmetry that organize the plan. This presents an interesting contradiction between the formal and the experiential. While quite ordered in plan, the experience of walking through the complex is random and episodic.Loomis, Revolution of Forms, p.71 =School of Music - Vittorio Garatti= The School of Music is constructed as a serpentine ribbon 330 meters long, embedded in and traversing the contours of the landscape approaching the river. The scheme and its paseo arquitectonico begin where a group of curved brick planters step up from the river. This path submerges below ground as the band is joined by another layer containing group practice rooms and another exterior passage, shifted up in section from the original band. Displacements are read in the roofs as a series of stepped, or terraced, planters for flowers. This 15m wide tube, broken into two levels, is covered by undulating, layered Catalan vaults that emerge organically from the landscape, traversing the contours of the ground plane. Garatti's meandering paseo arquitectonico presents an ever-changing contrast of light and shadow, of dark subterranean and brilliant tropical environments.Loomis, Revolution of Forms, p.86 =School of Ballet ‚Äì Vittorio Garatti= School of Ballet, Vittorio Garatti From the top of the golf course's ravine, one looks down upon the ballet school complex, nestled into the descending gorge. The plan of the school is articulated by a cluster of domed volumes, connected by an organic layering of Catalan vaults that follow a winding path. There are at least five ways to enter the complex. The most dramatic entrance starts at the top of the ravine with a simple path bisected by a notch to carry rainwater. As one proceeds, the terra cotta cupolas, articulating the major programmatic spaces, emerge floating over lush growth. The path then descends down into the winding subterranean passage that links the classrooms and showers, three dance pavilions, administration pavilions, library and the Pantheon-like space of the performance theater. The path also leads up onto its roofs which are an integral part of Garatti's paseo arquitectonico. The essence of the design is not found in the plan but in the spatial experience of the school's choreographed volumes that move with the descending ravine.Loomis, Revolution of Forms, p.45 Decline The 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis provoked an international incident that posed serious challenges for Cuba. In addition, setbacks across the Socialist world (the assassination of Congolese leader Patrice Lumumba in 1961, the coup against Algerian President Ahmed Ben Bella in 1965, the Sino-Soviet split, the newly launched guerrilla war in Vietnam), marked a turning point and created a sense of isolation and embattlement in Cuba facing the Cold War alone in the Caribbean. Production and defense became primary national priorities and the population was militarized. The government began to consider the National Art Schools to be extravagant and out of scale with reality.Loomis, Revolution of Forms, p.116 Construction of the art schools slowed down, as more and more of the workforce was now redirected to areas considered of greater national priority. The architects were also encountering criticism. Many in the Ministry of Construction did not trust the Catalan vault as a structural system. There was also a certain amount of envy on the part of many of the ministry bureaucrats toward the comparatively privileged conditions under which Porro, Gottardi, and Garrati were working.Loomis, Revolution of Forms, p.113 These tensions would prove to escalate. As Cuba's political environment evolved from one of utopian optimism into an evermore doctrinaire structure, following models provided by the Soviet Union, the National Art Schools found themselves as subjects of repudiation. The schools were criticized for ideological errors. The architects themselves were accused of being \\"elitists\\" and \\"cultural aristocrats,\\" with \\"egocentric\\" bourgeois formations.Segre, Diez A√±os de Arquitectura Revolucionaria en Cuba, p. 87 The constructive system, the Catalan vault, was now criticized as a \\"primitive\\" technology that represented \\"backward\\" values of the capitalist past. The Afro-Cuban imagery of the School of Plastic Arts was attacked as representative of ‚Äúhypothetical Afro-Cuban origins‚Äù which had been ‚Äúerased by slavery‚Äù and therefore held no relevance of a society advancing toward a culturally uniform socialist future. =Soviet-style functionalism vs. organic architecture= At the same time, these ideological issues also served to mask a very non-ideological drama. The National Art Schools and their architects were caught in a power struggle, with an architect named Antonio Quintana playing a major role. Quintana was a staunch modernist who, as the 1960s unfolded, embraced a Functionalist model for architecture, a model that advocated massive prefabricated production ‚Äì precisely the model upon which architecture was based in the Soviet Union. This model was completely at odds with the site-specific, craft-oriented, formal poetry of the National Art Schools. Quintana quite successfully, and quickly, maneuvered his way up through the ranks of the Ministry of Construction to ever increasing power. His growing authority and outspoken criticism of the National Art Schools helped to determine their fate. In July 1965, the National Art Schools were declared finished in their various stages of completion and incompletion, and construction came to a halt.Loomis, Revolution of Forms, p.129 In October 1965, Hugo Consuegra wrote a courageous defense of the National Art Schools, and their architects, that was published in the journal Arquitectura Cuba. This article was the last attempt of this period to reconcile the schools with the values of the Cuban Revolution. Consuegra described the formal complexities, spatial ambiguities, and disjunctive qualities of the schools not as in contradiction with but as characteristic and positive values of the Cuban Revolution. However, Consuegra's courageous defense proved to be in vain, and as the schools fell out of institutional favor, they were slowly abandoned. The Schools of Modern Dance and Plastic Arts continued to be used, though with little regard for their maintenance, and the Schools of Dramatic Arts, Music, and Ballet were allowed to fall into various states of abandonment and decay. The School of Ballet, nestled in a shady ravine, became completely engulfed in tropical jungle overgrowth. Ricardo Porro and later Vittorio Garatti were compelled to leave the country. Rehabilitation In 1982, a group of young Cuban architects, all critical of the way architecture was taught and practiced in Cuba, began meeting informally. In 1988 they were given official status as a part of the Hermanos Sa√≠z, a young artists‚Äô organization under the auspices of the Ministry of Culture. The 1980s in Cuba were a period that produced art that was highly polemical, even protest oriented. The Ministry of Culture had a higher tolerance for discord than the Ministry of Construction, and it was for this reason that young architects sought to associate themselves there.Loomis, Revolution of Forms, p.147 High on their agenda was the restoration of the National Art Schools to Cuba's architectural heritage. This was not necessarily a safe position to take at this time, yet the Ministry of Culture allowed them a certain latitude within which to maneuver. By 1989 John Loomis, a North American architect and scholar, met Roberto Gottardi and the Havana Biennial of Art, and Gottardi conducted him on a tour of the schools. Moved by the compelling architecture and story, Loomis embarked on a decade- long project that produced the book Revolution of Forms, Cuba‚Äôs Forgotten Art Schools. The 1990s were a decade of political, if not material, rehabilitation for the schools and their architects. In 1991, the Hermanos Sa√≠z organized a provocative exhibit entitled Arquitectura Joven that was presented as part of the Fourth Havana Biennial. Prominent in the exhibition was a photomontage by Rosendo Mesias highly critical of the crumbling state of the schools. In 1995, the schools were nominated for national monument status but were rejected for not being old enough to meet criteria. Also in 1995, the U.S. photographer Hazel Hankin held an exhibit in Havana of photographs of the schools in their state of neglect. The exhibit provoked a strong response, and in 1996, upon the initiative of Cuban cultural officials, the New York architects Norma Barbacci and Ricardo Zurita prepared nomination papers on behalf of the schools for the World Monuments Fund. The schools were eventually added to the WMF watch list in 2000 and 2002. In 1997, the Cuban National Conservation Institute designated the National Art Schools as a ‚Äúprotected zone‚Äù. The three architects also underwent a process of political \\"rehabilitation\\". Vittorio Garatti first returned to Cuba in June 1988 for a personal visit. Ricardo Porro returned for the first time in March 1996 for a series of public lectures, which were attended by standing-room-only audiences. Porro returned again in January 1997 to conduct a three-week design charrette with students, and give lectures. Vittorio Garatti also returned later that same year in June and lectured at the Colegio de Arquitectos. Porro returned again in 1998 to lecture, and in that same year an issue of Arquitectura Cuba was dedicated to him and his work. The subsequent issue was dedicated to Roberto Gottardi and his work. Throughout the 1990s there was much debate about the schools and this debate moved to higher and higher levels.Loomis, Revolution of Forms, pp.145-153 =National monument status= 1999 proved to be a critical year for the schools. In March, the book Revolution of Forms, Cuba‚Äôs Forgotten Art Schools was launched at two high-profile events. In Los Angeles the launch took place at R. M. Schindler's Kings Road House at the MAK Center, with an exhibition of photos of the schools by Paolo Gasparini taken in 1965. The event reunited Ricardo Porro, Vittorio Garatti, and Roberto Gottardi for an emotional first time since 1966, when they had last seen each other in Havana. The MAK Center event was repeated in New York at Columbia University and the Cooper-Hewitt Museum, generating copious press, including two articles in the New York Times. The exhibit went on to tour across Europe and the United States; all of the events and press coverage were closely followed by government officials in Cuba.In Cuba, Seeds of a Design Renaissance, NY Times, October 7, 1999CURRENTS: LOS ANGELES -- REVOLUTIONS; Art Schools Of Cuba, Forgotten No More, NY Times, March 18, 1999 Revolution of Forms also became a major topic of discussion among architects in Havana. At one meeting prior to its publication a government official declared that Loomis, the author, was ‚Äúan enemy of Cuba, being paid by the CIA, to write a book about the National Art Schools in order to make Cuba and the Revolution look bad‚Äù. By October 1999, however, the debate had reached the national congress of the National Union of Writers and Artists of Cuba (UNEAC) with the Council of State where the discussion was about the cultural role of architecture in Cuba. When it came to the National Art Schools, several important figures declared that the schools were the greatest architectural achievements of the Cuban Revolution. The ensuing discussion acknowledged the influence of Revolution of Forms‚Äîthe international attention it had garnered and the many foreign travelers it had attracted to visit the National Art Schools. Unfortunately, the schools were in a far-from-presentable state. Shortly thereafter, Castro declared that the schools would be recognized, restored, and preserved as national monuments. Porro and Garatti were summoned to a meeting in December 1999 with government officials to plan for the restoration. In November 2011, the National Art Schools were declared monuments by the National Council of Conservation. =World Heritage status= This site was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List on February 28, 2003 in the Cultural category. Works inspired by the schools Felipe Dulzaides, a Cuban artist, had studied at the National Art Schools and had often marveled at the beauty of the architecture there‚Äîespecially the magic realist aura evoked by the group of buildings. He had been unaware of their origins until he came upon a copy of Revolution of Forms in the United States. His artistic response to the story came later that year in the form of a video-documented performance-art piece called Next Time it Rains the Water Will Run, in which he cleans out the watercourses of the abandoned School of Ballet. The story of the National Art Schools continued to inspire Dulzaides resulting in a performance/installation in 2004 for the Proyecto Invitaci√≥n in Havana, which was followed by a more extensive, and highly acclaimed, installation titled Utop√≠a Posible at the Gwangju Biennial (South Korea) in 2008 and the Havana Biennial in 2009. This endeavor also evolved into a documentary video titled Utop√≠a Posible‚Äîa series of penetrating, and sometimes disquieting, interviews with Gottardi about his artistic quest for meaning during his years in revolutionary Cuba. Non-Cubans have also been inspired by the universal nature of the story of the National Art Schools. Alysa Nahmias was so moved by the schools she saw during her study abroad experience in Cuba as an undergraduate at New York University that she began working on a documentary film about the schools in 2001. The film, Unfinished Spaces, was co-directed by Ben Murray and scheduled to premiere in 2011.http://www.ajnafilm.com/unfinishedspaces/index.html San Francisco area-based filmmaker Charles Koppelman was also inspired by the schools‚Äô story and sought a medium that would embrace all of the arts: visual arts, music, dance, and theater. His vision was for an opera, Revolution of Forms, named after the book from which he learned the schools‚Äô story. Koppelman is producer as well as librettist along with author (and former NAS faculty member) Alma Guillermoprieto.

Both countries established diplomatic relations in 1868, originally between the Holy See and Ottoman Empire. The Holy See has a nunciature in Ankara. Turkey has an embassy in Rome.  History Ottoman Empire= The Holy See has a history of difficult relations with Turkey, or rather with the Ottoman Empire, whose forces its European allies defeated at the naval battle of Lepanto in 1571 and the battle of Vienna in 1683. The Holy See maintained positive relations with Armenia, even when it was under Ottoman rule. It was also involved in the Balkans and Greece at a time when nationalities were emancipating themselves from Turkish domination. =Atat√ºrk revolution= The Atat√ºrk revolution did not really ease relations, since it led to the suppression of the millet system, which had previously guaranteed the rights of Christian minorities that were split in Byzantine, Latin, Armenian, Syriac and Greek-Melkite ethnic lines. This is in turn led to the assimilation of Turkey's Christian population into ethnic Turkish traditions and customs. Also, the Kemalist ideology was closely related to anticlericalism in France, a French republican ideology which had been hostile to the Church in Western Europe. =Papal visits= Pope Paul VI visited Turkey in July 1967Apostolic Journey to Istanbul, Ephesus and Smyrna 25 - 26 July 1967 During his visit he met with Eastern Orthodox Patriarch Athenagoras I of Constantinople,Letter to Patriarch Athenagoras concerning the reasons to promote the re-establishment of unity between the Western and Eastern Church (Istanbul, 25 July 1967) Shenork I Kaloustian, Armenian Patriarch of ConstantinopleTo the Armenian Patriarch His Beatitude Snork Kalustian (Istanbul, 25 July 1967) as well as members of the MuslimTo the religious leader of the Muslim Community (Istanbul, 25 July 1967) and Jewish communities.To the religious leader of the Hebrew Community (Istanbul, 25 July 1967) Pope John Paul II visited Turkey in November 1979. He met with Patriarch Dimitrios I of ConstantinopleTo His Holiness Dimitrios, Patriarch of Constantinople (November 29, 1979) and Armenian Patriarch Shenork ITo the Armenian Patriarch of Istanbul (November 29, 1979) as well as celebrating the Eucharist in Ephesus.Eucharistic Celebration in Ephesus (November 30, 1979) In 2006, Pope Benedict XVI visited Turkey and its famous Blue Mosque. It was only the second time a sitting Pope was known to have entered a mosquePope makes Turkish mosque visit and was part of his efforts to mend Muslim-Christian relations, but was overshadowed by the controversy surrounding lecture at Regensburg which was interpreted by some as an attempt to link Islam and violence. He was met with 25,000 nationalist and Islamist protesters when he arrived at Ankara. =Visits to Vatican= Turkish president Celal Bayar visited the Vatican on 11 July 1959 and met with Pope John XXIII. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan visited the Vatican in February 2018 and had a meeting with Pope Francis at Apostal Palace. Religious issues The Holy See has maintained positive relations with the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople since the 1960s. The Ecumenical Patriarch who is based in current day ƒ∞stanbul is not recognized as leader of the Eastern Orthodox by the Turkish government, which prefers to regard him as a local bishop. This non-recognition of the Patriarch is an issue in Holy See‚ÄìTurkey relations. The Church has also sought to have improved legal recognition of itself under Turkish law, which at present makes it difficult for Catholic bishops to be legally recognized in their exercise of Apostolic ministry, while at times the ownership of churches is put into question. Similar problems have come up with the Greek Patriarchate, whose seminary training was shut down by the Turkish state. Armenian genocide In 2000, John Paul II officially recognized the Armenian Genocide, an opposing position to that of the Turkish government which has deployed much of its political energies in having the events in Armenia remain unrecognized by the international community. On 12 April 2015, Pope Francis used the term 'genocide' to refer to mass killings of Armenians by Turks. In response, Turkey recalled its ambassador to the Vatican for \\"consultations\\" just hours after Francis' comments, and summoned the ambassador from the Vatican for a meeting. Also, on June 24, 2016, Pope Francis in another speech described the killing of Armenians as a genocide. In addition, the Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi, told the reporters that \\"There is no reason not to use this word in this case,\\" \\"The reality is clear and we never denied what the reality is.\\" Turkey condemned the declaration as ‚Äúvery unfortunate‚Äù and also said that it bore traces of ‚Äúthe mentality of the Crusades.‚Äù EU membership The Holy See has not taken a strong position on EU membership for Turkey, although Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger was said to be hostile to it in a book he published before becoming Pope, and felt that Turkey should instead focus on relations with nearby Middle Eastern States. However, during his 2006 trip to Turkey as Pope Benedict XVI, he came out in support of Turkeys EU membership. Tarcisio Bertone, the Holy See's Secretary of State, has voiced the opinions of the Apostolic See on these matters. Tourism and pilgrimages Relations exist between the Holy See and Turkey on the basis of tourism and pilgrimages. In the 2008-2009 Year of Saint-Paul, an agreement was reached between the two States in order to promote pilgrimages to Tarsus, the place that the apostle Paul was born. Other important pilgrimage sites include Sel√ßuk, the old city of ƒ∞stanbul, ƒ∞znik (Nicaea), Bergama, ƒ∞zmir (Smyrna), Manisa and Trabzon.

The book is dated to the 12th or 13th century. He is called \\"the Younger\\" to distinguish him from Serapion the Elder, aka Yahya ibn Sarafyun, an earlier medical writer with whom he was often confused. Serapion the Younger's Simple Medicaments was likely written in Arabic, but no Arabic copy survives, and there is no record of a knowledge of the book among medieval Arabic authors.An Illustrated History of the Herbals, by Frank J. Anderson, year 1999 pages 40, 42 and 44. The book was translated to Latin in the late 13th century and was widely circulated in late medieval Latin medical circles.Les Noms Arabes Dans S√©rapion, by Pierre Guigues, in Journal Asiatique year 1905 pages 473-480. Portions of the Latin text make a good match with portions of a surviving Arabic text Kitab al- adwiya al-mufrada attributed to Ibn Wafid (died 1074 or 1067).Book, Ibn WƒÅfid (m. 460/1067): KitƒÅb al-adwiya al-mufrada (libro de los medicamentos simples), edici√≥n, traducci√≥n, notas y glossarios, by Luisa Fernanda Aguirre de C√°rcer, year 1995, in two volumes. Volume II has the medieval Arabic text of Ibn Wafid, and Volume I translates it into modern Spanish. In volume I in numerous footnotes the editor mentions content correspondences between Ibn Wafid and Serapion the Younger. The entire Latin text is very heavily reliant on medieval Arabic medicinal literature; and it is essentially just a compilation of such literature. It is exceedingly clear that the book was not originally written in a Latin language. Nothing about Serapion the Younger's biography is on record anywhere. In his only book, there is a quote from something by a certain medical writer who died around 1070 (Ibn Wafid). That puts a lower bound on when Serapion the Younger wrote. It is therefore supposed he wrote in the 12th century. It remains possible he wrote in the 13th century because there is no record of the full book anywhere until the late 13th century. On the basis of his name he might have been a Christian because \\"Serapion\\" and its Arabic equivalents \\"Sarafyun\\" and \\"Sarabi\\" is a Greek name. But since the identity of this Serapion is completely unknown, his name Serapion can be a pseudepigraph, whereby he was using the authority of the name of the earlier Serapion to give more credence to his own work. He calls himself the very same name as Serapion the Elder called himself. The distinction between \\"the Younger\\" and \\"the Elder\\" was introduced later by others after it was realized that they cannot be the same person. Pseudepigraphy was common in the medieval era. In the title Simple Medicaments, \\"simple\\" means non-compound: a practical medicine most often consisted of a mix of two or more \\"simples\\". The work was written for physicians and apothecaries. In the book's early part, Serapion the Younger classifies substances according to their medicinal properties, and discourses on their actions.The Penny Cyclopaedia of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge (1841), volume 21 page 260. The remainder and largest part of the book is a compendium of information on individual medicaments quoted from Dioscorides, Galen, and numerous named medieval Arabic writers on medicaments, with relatively brief supporting remarks by himself. A partial copy of Serapion's book survives from the medieval era in Hebrew. One historian of medieval Arabic medicine, Lucien Leclerc (died 1893), has presented some evidence that the book might have been written in Hebrew, notwithstanding that practically all of the book's information is taken from Arabic literature.Historie de la M√©dicine Arabe, by Lucien Leclerc, year 1870, volume 2 pages 152-156 and pages 470-471. The Latin translation circulated in the 14th and 15th centuries under the title Liber Serapionis Aggregatus in Medicinis Simplicibus, and Serapionis Aggregatoris de Simplicibus Comentarii, and Liber de Simplicibus Medicamentis, and Liber de Simplici Medicina. There is also a manuscript of it in a Latin-to-Italian translation dated 1390-1404 which contains many colour illustrations of plants, and which historians have named the \\"Carrara Herbal\\". Medievally the work was sometimes coupled with the works of the elder Serapion, as they were often supposed to have been the same person. After the invention of the printing press, editions were printed in Latin in 1473 (Milan), 1479 (Venice), 1525 (Lyon) and 1531 (Strasburg).The Great Herbal of Leonard Fuchs, by Frederick G. Meyer, et al., year 1999, volume one page 790. The edition of 1531 was supervised by the botanist Otto Brunfels. Very many lengthy extracts from Serapion's book are recycled in a Latin medicine encyclopedia written by Matthaeus Silvaticus dated 1317, which was itself widely circulated in late medieval Latin and printed many times during the early decades after the invention of the printing press. In the early 16th century, leading new botany books by Peter Sch√∂ffer (first published 1484), Leonhart Fuchs (1542), Rembert Dodoens (1554),A New Herball, or, Historie of Plants, by Rembert Dodoens, first published 1554. and others, contain information that is explicitly attributed to the book of Serapion (the younger). The primary historical interest in Serapion's book arises from the fact that it was widely read by medical-botany scholars in Latin in the years 1300 ‚Äì 1550 and it had a role in the transmission of medieval Arabic medicinal knowledge to the medieval Latins. It is judged today to be inferior to a comparable compilation by Ibn al-Baitar entitled Book of Simple Medicaments and Foods dated 1240s. Ibn al-Baitar's book in Arabic was not translated to Latin during the medieval era.

A non-profit trade organization, MBMA's headquarters is in Cleveland, Ohio. The organization consists of building system members, who are certified according to standards which have been set by the International Accreditation Service of the International Code Council, and associate members, who work in the metal building industry. MBMA has a General Manager, and it has a Chairman and Board of Directors who are elected by members on an annual basis. MBMA History The Metal Building Manufacturers Association, commonly known as the MBMA, was founded in 1956 by a group of companies that designed, manufactured, and marketed metal buildings. The first group of 13 metal building systems companies came together under the leadership of Wilbur B. Larkin in order to work together to promote metal building systems and be the technical voice of the industry. Early in the 1900s, prior to the formation of the MBMA, metal beams and panels were used for garages with small structures and were advertised for sale in publications such as the Saturday Evening Post. The first standing seam metal roof was introduced by Armco Steel Corp at the 1934 Century of Progress Exposition in Chicago. The use of pre-engineered buildings increased during World War II with the introduction and evolution of the Quonset Hut, a portable and inexpensive solution to housing and other needs. After the war, metal buildings became more widely accepted for other uses. During the 1950s, metal building manufacturers began to use a builder/dealer network model. The builders provided contracting and erection services and the manufacturers offered training courses for the building of their structures. At that time, Wilber Larkin of Butler Manufacturing wrote to a number of companies and invited them to a meeting in Chicago. On September 25, 1956, 13 companies officially formed the Metal Building Contractors & Erectors Association (renamed over the years to System Builders Association, and then Metal Building Manufacturers Association). The charter took effect on October 1, 1956 with Armco Steel Corp., Behlen Manufacturing, Butler Manufacturing, Carew Steel, Metallic Buildings, Pascoe Steel, Soule Steel, Steelcraft Manufacturing, Stran-Steel Corp. and Wonder Building Corp as the original members. MBMA member sales were $69.6 million in 1956. The association and its membership grew throughout the late 1950s, and each decade after that. In 1960, member sales were $98.6 million and they shipped approximately 260,000 tons of steel. There were 16 members in 1960, and in 1968 the Metal Building Dealers Association was formed. In 1970, the MBMA had 25 members with sales of $363 million. This decade saw the industry advance through a number of new developments. The standing seam roof system came into wide production and use during these years. Additionally, modern coating systems for both metal roofs and walls allowed metal buildings to incorporate a variety of colors. During this decade, the association hired its first full-time director of research and engineering - Dr. Duane Ellifritt, a former engineer with Armco and then on the faculty of Oklahoma State University. In 1980, member sales climbed to over $1 billion with steel shipments exceeding 1 million tons. Metal Building News became the industry's first tabloid-size trade publication when it began publishing in 1980. It is now called Metal Construction News, and in 1985, a second industry magazine began publishing, Metal Architecture. In 1990 MBMA member sales exceeded $1.5 billion and steel shipped was over 1.2 million tons. By 2000, MBMA member sales were over $2.5 billion and steel shipments were in excess of 1.875 million tons. Sales and shipments fell after the 2008 recession, but have since rebounded. For the most recent year that the association has on record, 2014 sales were $2.45 billion and members shipped approximately 1,060,000 tons of steel. =Engineered Metal Building Systems= Having evolved from the steel beam and corrugated structures of the early 20th century, metal buildings now use computer-aided design and drafting (CAD) systems. Metal buildings incorporate different architectural finishes to provide the appropriate facade for various facility types. =Research and development= When founded, ‚ÄúMBMA‚Äôs main purpose was to jointly attack technical matters that could not be addressed by individual companies,‚Äù according to the late James Murphy, former president of American Buildings Co. and former MBMA chairman. A Technical Committee was established and began to research and document important issues in metal building design and construction. The first publication of the new association was the MBMA Recommended Design Practices Manual, introduced in 1959. The Technical Committee helped promote and add its expertise to research being undertaken by other groups, such as the American Iron and Steel Institute's work at Cornell University that led to the publication of Design of Light Gauge Steel Diaphragms in 1967. MBMA first co-sponsored research in 1966 with a study on tapered structural members conducted at the State University of New York at Buffalo by Dr. George Lee. In 1974, MBMA began sponsoring wind load research to resolve differences in various standards and codes. The then-current American National Standards Institute, or ANSI, standard was based on high- rise buildings and was not appropriate for low-rise structures. This was not simply an issue for metal buildings, but all low-rise non-residential construction. Head of Walls: MBMA and the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) sponsored fire protection tests on head of wall (HOW) joints in metal buildings. This work was performed at Underwriters Laboratories and was designed to show the fire resistive nature of the HOW joints in metal buildings. The tests resulted in three new UL Certifications (HW-D-0488, HW-D-0489, and HW-D-0490), as well as further clarification from the UL for those who work with fire rated walls and unrated ceiling assemblies. Hot Box Testing: Buildings consume approximately 40 percent of energy used in the United States annually. The MBMA is working with the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in Tennessee to create more energy efficient structures ORNL's Large Scale Climate Simulator (LSCS) can enclose building assemblies to replicate different climatic conditions and provide ‚Äúhot box‚Äù testing in accordance with ASTM C1363 MBMA is currently working with ORNL on next- generation roofing assemblies that have been designed to increase energy efficiency, primarily by using unique combinations of insulation. ORNL provides expertise on heat-transfer fundamentals and helps to target areas to improve. Recently, MBMA started working with ORNL on the Flexible Research Platform project. This work is helping to make metal building systems more efficient and keep the industry ahead of code requirements. Overhead Doors and Metal Buildings: MBMA has been working with the Door and Access System Manufacturers Association (DASMA) for the past several years to create better doors and openings for metal buildings. Five years of collaboration and research has focused on rolling steel overhead doors and the effects of wind on the doors and the building. As a result of this collective effort in the summer of 2010, DASMA released a technical guide to ensure that metal building framing can adequately support a rolling door. The MBMA continues to perform research into wind loads on metal buildings, roof systems, and other aspects of low-rise construction. Additionally, the association has sponsored and led research into bolted end plate connections, cold-formed steel, snow loads and wind uplift, and insurance issues for metal buildings, among other topics that are pertinent to the industry. Membership frameless In 2018 there were 43 Building Systems Members and 72 Associate Members. See U.S. map at right. Education The MBMA educates members of the building community, including designers, engineers, architects, erectors, contractors, and code officials about metal building systems. It works with various groups and associations to keep code officials apprised of the advances in metal building systems and how they apply to the building codes. The association also works to educate members and other parts of the building community on best practices\\"ReferenceA/\\" and how to apply research and design improvements in their work. The MBMA offers educational resources that can be downloaded for free. MBMA sponsors a continuing education course through Northern Illinois University. This course, developed with the help of a team of architects, provides an overview of engineered metal building systems, how they are different from other metal structures and how to work with these structures. It is a particularly informative course for those who are unfamiliar with the specifics of engineered metal building systems. The course is accredited by the American Institute of Architects (AIA) and provides continuing education units (CEUs) for those who take the course and pass the test. The MBMA Media channel on YouTube.com offers a variety of videos and recorded webinars on topics of interest, including design, construction, testing, research and accreditation. Accreditation The MBMA has an accreditation program in conjunction with the International Code Council's International Accreditation Service (IAS). This program replaced the AISC-MB certification that the MBMA had previously required for membership in the association. The American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC) and the MBMA mutually agreed to end the AISC sponsorship of the Metal Building Certification program at the end of 2008. Publications The MBMA offers various publications. The following is a list of some of the notable publications of the association. Metal Building Systems Manual: The 2012 Metal Building Systems Manual is the latest edition of this manual, which was first published in 1959. This edition merges the 2010 Supplement to the 2006 Metal Building Systems Manual into one printed edition that has been updated to reflect the 2012 International Building Code (IBC). The Metal Building Systems Manual includes important topics for metal buildings such as load application, crane loads, fire ratings information and energy conservation. It also has material on common industry practices, guide specifications and climatological data for the entire United States.

The area is under consideration for inscription in UNESCO's list of sites that have \\"outstanding universal value.\\"  World Heritage status  This site was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List on 08/07/2002, in the mixed (cultural and natural) category.  Site description  The west side of the mountain is covered with a type of dense tropical vegetation that makes access difficult. The east face of the mountain is covered with many hamlets, and unique cultivated terraces that reach the summit. The population has its special customs, and dresses differently from other people in other regions. Bura is still very well protected. However, a road on the east side is currently being expanded and paved. Consequently, an increased number of vehicles could threaten the balance of the area's biodiversity. Mountain communities isolated from many modern communications media preserve their peculiarities. The east side of the mountain is tentatively listed as a Cultural Heritage site (by UNESCO), while the west side is tentatively listed under the Natural Heritage category. Five ecological levels of vegetation show climatic differences along 2,000 meters, with bananas at growing at the foot of Jabal, and durum wheat at the top. This diverse ecology allows for the growth of various species of trees (30) and shrubs (40), of live and wild animals (10), reptiles (12), and a considerable number of endemic (+ 50) and migratory (30) birds etc. Several threats to the biodiversity exist: a lack of income jeopardizes the population's ability to protect their environment, and therefore the inhabitants cut down trees and shrubs to use as firewood. The construction of the new road across fragile landscapes to the summit will put pressure on the ecological balance and make access to the forest much easier, contributing to deforestation and allowing livestock to the graze the land. Recent legislation proposes to conserve the biodiversity by establishing a consortium with farmers and landowners. The legislation, approved by Parliament, will take action for development. Bura will be declared a \\"protected area\\", and the entire population is expected to receive economic benefits: a paved road, a health center, two schools, a greater distribution of water and electricity, loans, and beekeeping training for national and international tourists. This biodiversity is open to scientists of all disciplines and eco-tourism at the national and international levels.https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1723/  Notes  References  * Training course & workshop on Jabal Bura‚Äôa - Yemen Times Accessed 24-02-2009. * prados.html * McLaughlin, D.

The Abela family is a noble family of Malta. George Abela was unanimously elected President of the Republic of Malta by the Maltese Parliament in 2009, for the first time since the country gained its independence from the United Kingdom. His term ended in 2014. His son, Robert Abela, is the current Prime minister of Malta (since 2020). Wistin Abela was Malta‚Äôs finance minister, minister for development, minister of energy, ports and telecommunications and deputy prime minister. Carmelo Abela, Malta‚Äôs current minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade Promotion, was Malta‚Äôs minister for Home Affairs and National Security and the Deputy Speaker of House of Representatives of Malta. In the 18th century, Giacomo (Jacomo) Abela and his son Tommaso Abela left Malta to settle in Saint John of Acre to do trading with Malta. Elias Abela (the son of Tommaso Abela) and his sons Francis (who went to Egypt), Tommaso (Thomas) ‚Äì who had a son, Habib Abela (who went to India, China and Sudan where he died) ‚Äì and Giuseppe Tommaso (Joseph or Youssef) Abela are born in Saint John of Acre. The history of the Abela family in Lebanon starts in the early 19th century when Giuseppe Tommaso (Joseph or Youssef) Abela moved to Tyr (where he married) and then to Saida (where he settled). Because of the Maltese roots of the Abela family, Giuseppe Tommaso (Joseph or Youssef) Abela obtained for him and his descends, i.e. all the members of the Abela family in Lebanon, the British citizenship. The Abela family is a reputable family of Lebanon. During the 20th century, Dr. Habib Abela was a very famous medical doctor in ophthalmology and in otolaryngology who cured several heads of State and Government of Middle East countries. ‚ÄúAbela Fr√®res‚Äù was established in 1927 by Nicolas Abela, Fran√ßois Abela, Basile Abela and William Abela as a family owned firm importing and distributing pharmaceutical products in Lebanon and the Middle East. They also created ‚ÄúDroguerie de l‚ÄôUnion‚Äù. The members of the Abela family have always been known for their integrity and their loyalty to the cause they defend. In that matter, Dr. Michel Abela, (Doctor in Pharmacy) who was appointed as President of the Lebanese Pharmacists Order in 1998 and who developed an ethical system for this order decided to resign after only one year of presidency due to foreign & local political pressures that wanted him to accept and validate rules and regulations that were against his ethics and believes. In 1941, Robert Abela founded in Lebanon the Syndicate of Press Editors (‚ÄúSyndicat des r√©dacteurs de presse‚Äù) and became its first president. He also acquired the papers ‚ÄúAl-Zaman‚Äù and ‚ÄúAl-Bachir‚Äù (which was then offered to Bachir Gemayel and is now owned by the Bachir Gemayel Foundation). In 1948, along with his brothers Joe Abela and Edwin Abela, Albert Abela founded in Lebanon a major-league catering international group including various forms of catering, from life support services and food processing to transportation: supplying in-flight meals but also catered in airports (such as the airports of Beirut, Dubai, Heathrow, Gatwick, Athens, Sharjah, Bucharest and Sofia), in hospitals, in nursing homes, in hotels (in France Monaco, London and Egypt), in organizations (such as the United Nations United Nations Economic and Social Commission for West Asia, ESCWA, in Lebanon), in schools, in universities, in onshore and offshore oilfields and in event and hospitality catering. The group has also invested worldwide in the field of high-end leisure: acquisitions of several four- and five-star hotels in Egypt, the United Kingdom, France (Gray d‚ÄôAlbion in Cannes), and Monaco (L‚ÄôAbela Hotel in Monaco now known as H√¥tel Colombus). It also owns a significant stake of Casino du Liban, one of the largest state-owned enterprises in Lebanon and has been operating and managing it. The group has also opened, owned and managed supermarkets in Lebanon (later re-branded Monoprix after it has been rented and managed by the Lebanese operator of the brands of the Galeries Lafayette group) and in the Gulf. Operations in 40 countries (including the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, India and the United Kingdom), over 15 million meals a year including meals served to air passengers of 165 airlines, 34,000 employed people, and annual turnover of $1.3 billion. In 2001, the world largest catering organization, Sodexho Alliance (today known as Sodexo), acquired two companies of the group (also one of the world largest catering organization): in France, Sogeres (60% owned by the group and 40% owned by Paribas Affaires Industrielles, BNP Paribas), a company running the catering at the Roland Garros tennis championships in Paris and holding catering contracts with French commercial television channel TF1 and the American Hospital of Paris; and, in the United States, Wood Dining Services (100% owned by the group), a company operating in 21 states and having among its clients the National Security Agency, elderly care group ManorCare and Lehigh University in Pennsylvania. The group was the first to handle catering on offshore drilling rigs in the North Sea. Moreover, in 1974, in joint venture with the Maltese government, the group set up Medserv Limited. In 1997, the group bought out the Maltese government stake. In 2001, AD Holdings Limited (later renamed Medserv plc) was granted options by the group to purchase the entire equity of Medserv Limited (later renamed Medserv Operations Limited), a transaction that was completed in 2003. Medserv has exclusive rights to a 200-metre-long, deep water quay at the Malta Freeport, with an additional 5,000 square metres of adjacent land area and laydown facilities extending to 50,000 square metres within the Malta Freeport confines. Medserv offers a variety of services to oil and gas offshore operators, with the company‚Äôs main focus being on industry activity within North Africa and the Mediterranean basin. Aside from its Malta base, Medserv also has operations in Cyprus, Greece, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Iraq and Libya. William Abela has created ‚ÄúAbela Consulting & Management‚Äù (AC&M;), one of the leading consultancy and management companies in the hospitality industry in the Middle East, executing various projects in Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Europe was gratified in 1998 and elected ‚Äúhotelier of the year‚Äù in recognition of his accomplishments. He also developed ‚ÄúAbela Delices‚Äù, an upscale catering company in Lebanon that caters from A to Z, for up to 2,000 meals a day, for private dinners, weddings, birthdays, anniversaries, cocktails, parties and other multiple functions including the supply of equipment, staff, utensils and all materials needed for various events including for corporations. Up to 2,000 meals a day. ‚ÄúAbela Delices‚Äù was the appointed caterer of prestigious clubs such as the Golf Club of Lebanon as well as international companies & cafeterias that wanted to give to their executives high en food services. William Abela has also been known for his engagement defending associative and humanitarian causes and has always given a major part of his time to defend child and elder people interests and rights. B√©chara Nammour and his wife Henriette Abela have invested in Albergo Hotel in Lebanon, H√¥tel Daniel in Paris, and in Sheraton Hotel in Texas as well as in other hotels in the United States; but also in La Mie Dor√©e, Balthazar and Paul restaurants in Lebanon and in J. Paul‚Äôs (the restaurant founded by Paul J. Cohn) in Washington as well as in other restaurants in the United States and in France. Since 1995, Gilbert Abela has opened several restaurants in Beirut, Lebanon such as Julia‚Äôs (at Monnot street and then at Sursock street, with Albertino Abela), Claudia‚Äôs (at Abdel Wahab el-Inglizi street), Way‚Äôs Caf√© (at Place Sassine, with Andr√© Fayad), ‚ÄúRestaurant-Diner‚Äù (former ‚ÄúLe Coffee‚Äù, at Monnot street), Bar Tabac (former ‚ÄúFrench Caf√©‚Äù, at Sodeco area) and, Casa del Gelato (at Independence street, with Andr√© Fayad).

Background In 1926, the Aircraft Operating Company, an official contractor to the British Ordnance Survey for aerial survey work overseas, required a replacement for the converted Airco DH.9s that formed the majority of its fleet. The requirements included maximum reliability, all-metal construction so that it could operate in the tropics or the arctic, a preference that it could be broken down into parts for transport. It should be able to maintain height at 9,000 ft on a single engine while fully laden. It approached the de Havilland Aircraft Company which prepared a design for a twin-engined biplane of metal construction, resembling a smaller version of the de Havilland Hercules to meet the specification, designated de Havilland DH.67.Jackson 1987, p. 275. However, de Havilland was busy with production of the Hercules and DH.60 Moth and in November 1928 it transferred the project to Gloster Aircraft Company. The customers requirement was for an aircraft that could be converted to a seaplane and capable of surveying large areas while operating from a single base. Under Folland, Gloster comprehensively redesigned the aircraft with changes in all dimensions and for its own construction methods, the resulting aircraft being designated as Gloster AS.31 Survey.Jackson 1987, p. 276.James 1971, pp. 190‚Äì191. Design and development The Gloster Survey was a twin-engined biplane with a conventional landing gear and an open cockpit for two pilots, while a camera operator and survey camera could be accommodated in the enclosed cabin.Jackson 1974, p. 314James 1971, p. 192. The entirety of the front portion of the floor of the aircraft was glazed for so that three cameras could be installed. It was powered by two 525 hp (392 kW) Bristol Jupiter XI engines, mounted on top of each lower wing. Provision was made in the design to take alternative engines including the Armstrong Siddeley Jaguar, Pratt & Whitney Hornet, Lorraine-Dietrich 14Asc and Wright Cyclone.James p192 Operational history In June 1929, the prototype Survey (G-AADO) made its first flight. It was handed over to the Aircraft Operating Company on 25 January 1930 on an occasion patronised by the Secretary and Under-secretary for Air. It had the ability to fly effectively on the power of one engine alone. On 20 March 1930, piloted by Alan S.

The airfield is located approximately east-southeast of Longvic; about southeast of Paris. Operating as a joint civilian base, it is today used as a commercial airport named A√©roport Dijon-Bourgogne. History Dijon-Longvic Air Base was one of the oldest of the Arm√©e de l'Air, being established in 1914, having origins beginning in September 1910 as a civilian aerodrome.Histoire de la Base A√©rienne de Dijon It has been active for 102 years, through both 20th Century World Wars, the Cold War, and numerous crises. The military left the base in June 2016. =World War I= In the years following the sumptuous \\"aviation parties\\" that were held in Dijon (from 22 to 25 September 1910), the French War Department decided to build a military airfield near the city, and on 7 July 1913, nine hectares located between the villages of Ouges and Longvic, near the National Road 468, were declared of public utility. This airfield became operational in the spring of 1914 and was assigned the headquarters of the 1st Aviation Group, which was accommodated in several aircraft hangars and barracks. Four squadrons were stationed there when the World War broke out: the BR 17, BL 18, HF 19 and MF 20. It is on this military airfield that the 2e reserve aviation unit dedicated to the centralization of deliveries made ??by factories working for the aviation and transit to aviation squadrons of the parks from the front of the stored goods. 2Y also worked, from 1917, a flight school dedicated to piloting aircraft Voisin firm. On May 13, 1916, there was presented to the troops the flag of the Air Force by the most famous aces of war, Lieutenant Guynemer injured two months earlier at Verdun-bearer in front of the front of the troops of 1st group. =Between the wars= After 1919, Dijon-Longvic was used for deployment of several units specializing in pursuit and observation. In 1920, saw the birth of Dijon 2e observation aviation regiment equipped with Breguet 14 (renamed later 32nd RAO). That same year, on the edge of the airfield, an area was reserved for civil aviation and the land became \\"mixed aerodrome\\". Civil aviation was built near the future base 102, at the northern end of the coast and southwest of Dijon, aeronautical lighthouse great power of Mt. Africa, situated on the air route Paris-Lyon- Marseille. =World War II= During World War II, the airport was attacked by the Luftwaffe on several occasions (10, 14 May) during the Battle of France. It was seized by the German Army in june. Initially, during the Occupation of France, it was used as a Prisoner of War camp for French and Allied personnel, during August and September 1940, who surrendered during the German Blitzkrieg, being named \\"Front Stalag 155\\". While a POW camp, prisoners were used to clear the wreckage of destroyed aircraft and tear down destroyed buildings. German engineers moved in during the winter of 1940/1941 and expanded the main runway from 800 to 1400m in length, in addition to constructing many new buildings to replace the destroyed French facilities. The first operational Luftwaffe unit to take up residence at Dijon was IV/KG 55 \\"Greiff\\", in February 1941, consisting of three squadrons (Staffel) numbers 10, 11 and 12, equipped with 12 Heinkel 111 bombers each. The unit also included a number of Gotha 145 and Junkers 52s. This unit took part in many bombing missions over England. In March 1943, II/NJG4 arrived, a night fighter unit, equipped with three squadrons of Messerschmitt Bf 110s; Dornier 217 N-1s (RADAR equipped), and Ju 88 Ns Also in 1943, I/Luftlandgeschwader 2. arrived at Dijon from the Crimea in the Eastern Front, equipped with Heinkel 111Z reconnaissance aircraft, as well as Gotha 242 gliders. The unit only stayed at Dijon briefly, being moved to Istres for use in the Italian Campaign. While under Luftwaffe control, Dijon Air Base was attacked by the United States Army Air Forces Eighth Air Force heavy B-17 Flying Fortress groups on several occasions in 1944 (28 March, 25 April and August 14). Tactical air units of Twelfth Air Force, moving up from Southern France as part of Operation Dragoon attacked the base with B-26 Marauder medium bombers and P-47 Thunderbolt attacks, dropping 500-pound general-purpose (GP) bombs on the airfield, hangars, maintenance shops and other support buildings, causing great damage to the Luftwaffe aircraft as well as destroying much of the support station. With the Allied ground forces advancing into the Dijon area, the Germans evacuated the base on 10 September 1944. Prior to their retreat, German engineers attempted to destroy what little remained after the bombing attacks; they blew up the control tower, shelters, bunkers, ammunition and gasoline, water towers, tanks, electrical transformers, and barracks. On 12 September, the first American units arrived at the base. The base was almost totally destroyed, and rehabilitation into an operational combat airfield was begun almost immediately by the USAAF IX Engineering Command 847th Engineer Aviation Battalion, which specialized in repair of captured airfields. Work began clearing the base of mines and destroyed Luftwaffe aircraft and repairing operational facilities for use by American aircraft. A metal Pierced Steel Planking patch was laid down over the bomb damaged runway to allow aircraft operations, as well as repairing what could be repaired quickly, and moved in what equipment was necessary to conduct combat operations. Their work paid off, as Dijon Air Base was declared operationally ready on 25 September, about two weeks after their arrival. It was designated as Advanced Landing Ground \\"Y-9\\" as an American airfield.IX Engineering Command ETO Airfields General Construction InformationJohnson, David C.

Each of the bomb groups had three or four combat squadrons of aircraft assigned to the airfield. From Dijon, attacks on German ground forces, bridges, airfields still in Luftwaffe hands, railroads and any target of opportunity, of the German forces, were targets of the bombers as the ground forces moved north and east into Luxembourg and past the Siegfried Line into Germany. In addition to the American units, the Free French Air Force operated B-26 Marauders from Dijon beginning on 11 October 1944. Dijon was returned to the French Air Ministry by the Americans on 1 July 1945. =Postwar history= The war had left the airbase in genuine ruins, littered with rubble, debris, scrap metal and charred remains of airplanes. A number of aircraft remains and unexploded German munitions had been hastily bulldozed into bomb craters, all of which needed to be removed. The station area and the hangars and aircraft mechanical shops were devastated, also with huge quantities of unexploded munitions still littering the ground. The American combat engineers had carried out considerable repair work on the runway, and constructed temporary structures for repair and maintenance of aircraft; however, the personnel lived in tents as repair of the barracks was not considered a priority for aircraft operations. After much reconstruction, Dijon was returned to operational service for the French Air Force. The airfield was rebuilt and reopened in 1949. Responsible for air defense of France, BA 102 received in 1949 the 2d Fighter Wing and its squadrons, and became the first air base of the Air Force to be equipped with jet aircraft: the De Havilland 100 Vampire. The basic air units were, thereafter, with priority for several generations of Dassault aircraft, those being the MD 450 Hurricane in 1953, the Mystere IVA in 1956, the Mirage IIIC in 1961, then the Mirage IIIE in 1968. BA 102 also served as the backdrop to one of the most famous French television series: Sky Fighters. In 1984, the Dassault Mirage 2000C arrived, upgraded in 1999 by the 2000-5F, contributing to a modern, front-line NATO facility. BA 102 was the first basis for Europe to have a multi-target interceptor and a weapons system of such technology. Reorganization of the French air force has pushed the Dijon base into a secondary role in the 21st century. In 2014, the assigned fighter squadrons were reassigned and the base was put into a reserve status. It was closed officially in June 2016.

Negative search is different from both positive search and discovery search. Positive search uses the selection of relevant content as its primary mechanism. Discovery calculates relatedness (between user intent and content) to present users with relevant alternatives of which they may not have been aware. Negative search applies to those forms of searches where the user has the intention of finding a specific, actionable piece information but lacks the knowledge of what that specific information is or might be. Negative search can also apply to searches where the user has a clear understanding of negative intent (what they don't want) rather than what they do. Examples of negative intent are: \\\\- Job searching: someone knows they want a new job but they have no idea what it might be. They just know what they don't want. \\\\- Online dating: someone is looking for a dating partner, but cannot identify what criteria they are looking for. They just know what they don't want. \\\\- An investigator is looking for a car but has no other information on that car on which to base a search. Negative search classifiers If there are two forms of search (positive and negative) it follows that there are two forms of classifier models: inclusive classifiers and exclusive classifiers. Countries of the world are a good example of a MECE list. A positive search for the country Kenya would identify content referencing Kenya and present it. A negative search for the country Kenya would exclude all content relating to other countries in the world leaving the user with content of some relevance to Kenya. Irrelevancy as a desirable construct Positive search tends to view irrelevancy as undesirable. Having a system actively identify and pursue irrelevant content for the purpose of elimination from a user experience may prove a highly powerful mechanism. It follows that positive and negative search are not mutually exclusive and that a more powerful search may result from the combination of selection and elimination as tools to empower user experience in negative searches. Degrees of passivity Positive search involves an active search by a user with no degree of passivity (or openness). For example: \\"I am only interested in the Hilton Hotel in Vientiane on New Year's Eve.\\" Discovery involves a simultaneous secondary more Passive search by the user while they are involved in a positive search. For example: \\"I am interested in the Hilton Hotel in Vientiane on New Year's Eve but if there's a better hotel, let me know.\\" Negative search also involves an active search but with a much higher degree of passivity (or openness to discovery). For example: \\"I need a holiday and really don't care where as long as its good.\\" Searchers can be active in one dimension (positive search) while simultaneously being passive to alternatives or what they don't know they're looking for in many dimensions. In discovery they are passive in a small number of dimensions but in negative search they are passive in many or all dimensions.

Knopf, Inc. and wife of publisher Alfred A. Knopf Sr., with whom she established the firm in 1915. Blanche traveled the world seeking new authors and was especially influential in the publication of European and Latin American literature in the United States. For her accomplishments in developing and promoting the literature of France, she was named a Chevalier (Knight) of the L√©gion d'honneur by the French government in 1949, and became an Officier de la L√©gion d'honneur in 1960. She was also honored by Brazil with the Order of the Southern Cross. BiographyFamily and Early Life= Blanche Wolf was born in 1894 on the Upper West Side of New York City to to a Jewish family; her parents were Julius and Bertha (n√©e Samuels) Wolf. Blanche told others that Julius had been a jeweler in Vienna but in fact he had been a day laborer in Bavaria. After coming to America, he co-owned a millinery business (from which he divested before it went bankrupt), and later he owned the second largest children's hat company in the country. Her mother, Bertha, was the daughter of Lehman Samuels who co-owned Samuels Brothers, which was at one point the largest exporter of cattle in America. Blanche attended the Gardner School for Girls on the Upper East Side of New York City. Blanche was introduced to Alfred A. Knopf at a party at the Lawrence Athletic Club in Lawrence, New York, in 1911. Their relationship was built on their mutual interest in books. Blanche said of their relationship, \\"Alfred had realized I read books constantly and he had never met a girl who did.... I saw him and [all we did was] talk books, and nobody liked him -- my family least of all. But I did, because I had someone to talk books to and we talked of making books.... We decided we would get married and make books and publish them.\\" They were married on April 4, 1916 at the St. Regis hotel in New York. Their first home, which they called Sans Souci (meaning carefree), was in Hartsdale, New York. Their son, Alfred A. Knopf Jr., known as \\"Pat\\", was born on June 17, 1918. After Pat's birth, Blanche and Alfred moved back to Manhattan. =Alfred A. Knopf, Inc.= Knopf launched Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. with Alfred Knopf in New York in 1915. She learned the mechanics of printing and publishing and went on to become a highly influential editor. Knopf is credited with designing the Borzoi, a Russian wolfhound imprint marking Knopf titles. She became the Vice President of the company when it was incorporated in 1918. She often clashed with Alfred's father, Sam Knopf, who was named Treasurer when the firm was incorporated. Knopf became president of Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. in 1957 when Alfred Knopf became the chairman. Knopf frequently traveled to Europe and Latin America to meet foreign authors and publishers. She is credited with recruiting Sigmund Freud, Albert Camus, Andr√© Gide, Jean- Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, Ilya Ehrenburg, Mikhail Sholokhov, Thomas Mann, and Gilberto Freyre, striking deals to publish translations of their works in the United States. In 1936 Blanche Knopf returned from Europe concerned about the plight of German publishers and authors driven out of Germany because of Nazi persecution. Knopf told the reporter, \\"There's not a German writer left in Germany who is worth thinking about. The gifted writers and enterprising publishers who had any independence have all left Germany. Only Nazi writers and publishers remain. They write and publish to please the Nazi Government.\\" Thomas Mann called Blanche Knopf, \\"the soul of the firm.\\" Knopf is credited for advancing the careers of numerous authors, serving as an adviser while agreeing to publish the work of several influential authors. By the time she died, 27 Knopf authors had won the Pulitzer Prize and 16 the Nobel Prize. Knopf also worked closely with many American writers, including John Updike, Carl Van Vechten, Willa Cather, H.L. Mencken, Raymond Chandler, Dashiell Hammett and Langston Hughes. Knopf helped Carl Van Vechten launch writers of the Harlem Renaissance including Langston Hughes and Nella Larson. According to her biography by Laura Claridge she \\"legitimized the genre of hard-boiled detective fiction\\" with authors such as Dashiell Hammet, Raymond Chandler and Ross Macdonald.\\" Knopf was also responsible for acquiring William Shirer's Berlin Diary, John Hersey's Hiroshima and works by Edward R. Murrow.

It is located at the intersection of County Highway E and Robbson Drive. History Sabin was settled in the 1850s and named for Dr. Eli Sabin, one of the first settlers. Sabin lies near the head waters of Mill Creek, known originally as Eagle Creek or Eagle River. In early days the only access to Sabin was a rough road that followed the creek about south to its mouth on the Wisconsin River at Orion. Sabin had two churches. The Disciples or Christian Church of Sabin was organized in 1858 and erected a frame building about 1872. This building was replaced with a new building seating about 400 in 1904. Baptisms were performed in Mill Creek during the summer and in the cheese factory during the winter. The last service in the Christian Church was December 11, 1966, and the building was burned on April 25, 1979. The other church was the Mt. Tabor Methodist Church for which land was deeded in 1868. The local Independent Order of Odd Fellows lodge contributed to the erection of this church and used it for their meetings. This church no longer exists but it was holding services as late as 1900. The Mt. Tabor Methodist Church stood next to the Mt Tabor Cemetery, which received its first burials in the 1860s and remains in use for new burials. The first school building at Sabin was a log structure erected in 1856. It burned down in 1880 and was replaced the following year by a frame building. This building burned in 1917 and was replaced by another frame structure which burned down in 1929 and was replaced by a brick school house which still stands, although it ceased to be used as a school in 1962. The Sabin Livewires 4-H club has been active in the community since 1946. There was a cheese factory in Sabin at least as early as 1901, and through a succession of ownership, cheesemakers, and at least three buildings, cheese was made in Sabin until 1960. The second cheese factory, constructed about 1915, was a two story structure with the factory on the first floor and a large hall and kitchen on the second floor used for community gatherings. Sabin had its own post office from 1886 to 1911. Through several changes of ownership and location, there was a general store in Sabin from before 1896 until 1966.

Montague Cooke or C.M. Cooke. Life Charles Montague Cooke Jr. was born in Honolulu, Hawaii on December 20, 1874. He was from a wealthy family descended from two early missionaries to Hawaii. His mother was Anna Rice Cooke (1853‚Äì1934), a patron of the arts in Honolulu and founder of the Honolulu Museum of Art. His father was Charles Montague Cooke (1849‚Äì1909), co-founder of the Bank of Hawaii and benefactor of educational institutions such as Kamehameha Schools, Punahou School, and the Waikiki Aquarium. His grandfather Amos Starr Cooke (1810‚Äì1871) founded Castle & Cooke. Cooke graduated from Punahou School in 1893, and Yale University, with a Bachelor of Arts in 1897 and a Ph.D. in 1901. He married Eliza Lefferts (1880‚Äì1970) from Flatbush, New York on April 25, 1901. They traveled through Europe before returning to Hawaii. They built a grand estate in Manoa Valley, the Charles Montague Cooke Jr. House, also known as Kualii, which is on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places listings in Oahu. They had two children: Carolene Alexander Cooke (1905‚Äì1987) and Charles Montague Cooke III (1907‚Äì1952). Unlike his father and younger brothers such as Clarence Hyde Cooke who became financiers, his interests were in the field of malacology, the study of molluscs. His cousin Annie Montague Alexander (1867‚Äì1950) also became a scientist. From 1902 he was a curator of the Bernice P. Bishop Museum collection of Pulmonata (snails) in Honolulu. In 1905 he bought the extensive collection of shells from early evolution scientist John Thomas Gulick. Cooke led the museum's Mangarevan Expedition in 1934. He worked with Henry Augustus Pilsbry to identify species of snails in the Hawaiian Islands. He took several expeditions with Kenneth Emory through the South Pacific. He directed the Cooke Foundation (created by his parents) from 1920 to 1948. From November 13, 1909 to April 30, 1914 he was on the board of regents of the University of Hawaii (then known as the College of Hawaii). From February 4, 1911 to July 1, 1913 he was on the Honolulu Parks Commission, and from July 1919 to June 1920 the Fish and Game Commission. (combined with those of his father) The University of Hawaii granted him an honorary doctorate in 1936. A street near the museum was named Monte Cooke Place for him, at . He died October 29, 1948 and was buried at the Mission Houses Cemetery near Kawaiaha ªo Church. His assistant Yoshio Kond≈ç became the new curator at the Bishop Museum.

The only Palestine-specific flag not restricted to official government use was the Palestine ensign (red with the Union Flag in the canton, and a white circle on the fly with the mandate's name inside it), which was flown by ships registered in the British Mandate territory from 1927 to 1948. This flag had an extremely limited use on land and was not embraced by either the Arabs or the Jews of the Palestine mandate territory. It was based on the British Red Ensign (civil ensign) instead of the Blue Ensign (used as the basis for the flags of nearly all other British-ruled territories in Africa and Asia) since it was intended for use only at sea by non- government ships.Civil Ensign 1927-1948 (British Mandate of Palestine) at FOTW siteBritish Mandate of Palestine 1923-1948 at FOTW site  Arab flags in Mandatory Palestine  Palestinian flag over the Alhambra Cinema, Jaffa, 1937 Palestinian Arabs sometimes flew their own flags, often variations of the Flag of the Arab Revolt. In 1929, a discussion was held for a Palestinian national flag and the newspaper Filastin published on its front page a proposal to establish a Palestinian national flag and anthem. Various different flags were proposed, they were mainly based on the Flag of the Arab Revolt but also included the use of crosses with crescents and the color orange. During the 1936‚Äì39 Arab revolt in Palestine a group was photographed with a flag similar to the current Palestinian flag but with a crescent and cross as well as Arabic inscription. File:Flag of Hejaz 1917.svgFlag of the Arab Revolt, many Palestinian nationalist flags were based on this. Jewish flags in Mandatory Palestine  1925 article in Filastin (newspaper), setting out objections to the flying of the Zionist flag under the guise of it being the flag of the HaKoah football team, given the ban against the Arab flag. It concludes by stating that the only official flag of the state is the Union Jack. The use of Zionist or Hebrew flags was common in the Yishuv, as the body of Jewish residents in Palestine was known before the establishment of the State of Israel, and such flags were often flown by such Yishuv institutions as The Jewish Agency or the Histadrut. However, the Yishuv constituted only one of the country's main ethnic communities - the other such community, the Palestinian Arabs, being opposed to the Zionist movement and to this movement's flag(s). Thus, Hebrew flags were never recognized or given an official status by the British authorities, which throughout the changes in their Palestine policy always asserted an impartiality as between Jews and Arabs - the only official Flag of Palestine being the Union Jack and its derivatives, as noted above. Still, the French dictionary Le Petit Larousse Illustr√© contained a world flag section which, from 1924 to 1939, showed the flag of Palestine as a yellow Star of David on a Blue and White background.Flag in Larousse Dictionary It is unknown on which basis Le Petit Larousse Illustr√© chose this flag as representing Palestine. While what would become after 1948 the Flag of Israel also includes the Star of David and a Blue and White background, these elements are arranged in a completely different way. In 1934 the National Geographic magazine published a photo of a flag similar to that of \\"Le Petit Larousse\\", flown by the Steam Ship \\"Emanuel\\" - the single vessel owned by the Palestine-based, Zionist-oriented Hofiya Shipping Company, then on her maiden voyage. The National Geographic caption read: \\"The 'Emanuel', flying a Palestine flag, anchors at Southampton, England. This Jewish trading vessel was the first to fly her country's new banner. Palestine, under British mandate, has a badge, but its Jewish population has created this flag of their own ‚Äî Solomon's seal on a field of blue and white.\\" Tragically, a few months after this item appeared in the National Geographic, the Emanuel was lost with all hands in the North Sea, putting an end to the Hofiya Company. In later Zionist and Israeli shipping enterprises, such as the Zim Company, there was no such flag used. A similar flag was also used by Hakoah Vienna - a Jewish, Zionist-oriented soccer and athletics club active in the Austrian capital.

Early life and career Livings was born in Prestwich, Lancashire, England. He won a scholarship from the Stand Grammar School in Whitefield to the University of Liverpool but attended for only two years, leaving in 1950 without graduating. He went on to serve in the Royal Air Force (1950‚Äì52), became an expert cook, and held a number of jobs before going into the theatre. He trained as an actor at Joan Littlewood's Theatre Workshop, which he joined in 1956. Livings appeared in the first of the Carry On films, Carry on Sergeant (1958) and as Wilf Haddon, Martha Longhurst's son- in-law, on Coronation Street in May 1964. His first stage play, Stop It, Whoever You Are, about a washroom attendant in a factory, was performed in 1961. The Evening Standard Awards for 1961 named Livings as Most Promising Playwright of the Year for Stop It, Whoever You Are, jointly with Gwyn Thomas, author of The Keep. Among other plays by Livings are The Quick and the Dead Quick (1961), an unconventional historical drama about Fran√ßois Villon; Big Soft Nellie (1961), whose witless hero creates chaos in a radio repair shop; and the play and TV comedy Nil Carborundum (1962), based on his experience of National Service. His play Eh? was performed Off-Broadway in 1966, with Dustin Hoffman in the leading role. Livings won an Obie Award for Best Play for the production. Eh? was turned into the 1967 film Work Is a Four-Letter Word, starring David Warner and Cilla Black. Many of the actors in this film were also members of the Royal Shakespeare Company, including Elizabeth Spriggs in her first screen role, and it was directed by RSC founder Peter Hall. His Pongo plays, performed in England during the 1960s and 1970s, have been described as Kyogen adaptations in a music hall style. Livings also wrote short stories, plays and screenplays, and contributed to the TV series Juliet Bravo (1980) and Bulman (1985). He collaborated with his friend, songwriter Alex Glasgow, who wrote the songs and music for the successful musical play Close the Coal House Door by Alan Plater. Together they starred in a 1971 comedy sketch series for BBC2, Get The Drift, based on their stage show The Northern Drift. Livings also jointly translated, together with academic Gwynne Edwards, three works by Spanish poet and playwright Federico Garc√≠a Lorca-‚ÄìThe Public, Play Without a Title and Mariana Pineda. Books by Livings include That the Medals and the Baton Be Put on View: Story of a Village Band, 1875‚Äì1975, which relates to Dobcross Band, two volumes of short stories, Pennine Tales (1985) and Flying Eggs and Things: more Pennine tales (1986), illustrated by his daughter Maria Livings, and his autobiography The Rough Side of the Boards (1994), also turned into a stage show, which featured Arthur Bostrom in its premiere.

Their imposing architecture meets two needs: defending the villagers, while leaving plenty of space for crops. Each town is built like a castle; the houses, themselves, form the wall, equipped with one or two easily defensible doors. Constructed from sandstone and basalt, the buildings are integrated into the landscape and it is difficult to tell where the rock and the village begins or ends. The mountain is divided into terraces of a few acres or more, separated by walls sometimes several meters high. On these terraced fields grow alfalfa for livestock, millet, lentils, large areas for coffee and qat. Within a day's journey are Bani Murrah and other villages located on the ridge overlooking Manakhah. Manakhah is the heart of mountain range, a large town whose market attracts villagers from the entire neighbourhood. Al Hajjara, to the west of Manakhah, is a walled village whose citadel was founded in the 12th century by the Sulayhids. From there, other villages are accessible, such as Bayt al-Qamus and Bayt Shimran. The village of Hutaib is built on a platform of red sandstone, facing a view of terraced hills which host a score of villages. Here also is the mausoleum of the third Yemeni Da'i al-Mutlaq Hatim ibn Ibrahim. Bohras from India, Sri Lanka, Madagascar and other countries gather here.  World Heritage Status  This area was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List on July 8, 2002, in the mixed (cultural and natural) category, as a site that has \\"outstanding universal value\\".

Gnosspelius and built by Short Brothers at Rochester for the 1923 Lympne light aircraft trials.Jackson 1974, page 315 Development Gnosspelius was head of the research department of Short Brothers, for whom he had devised an ingenious mechanism for testing aerofoil sections, the Gnosspelius Aerodynamic Pendulum.Experimental Data Without a Wind ChannelFlight International 21 December 1921 Tests using this had indicated that incorporating a small step into the upper surface of the wing at the point of its greatest thickness would reduce drag, and Gnosspelius had started work on the design of a small glider using this discovery when, in early 1923, two prizes intended to promote the development of light aircraft were announced. He accordingly revised his design to use a 679 cc Blackburne Tomtit V-twin motorcycle engine, driving a pair of chain-driven diameter pusher propellers running at two-thirds of the engine speed. The resulting aircraft was a single-seat high-wing monoplane with a circular section monocoque fuselage made of spruce planking built up over elm hoops, with spruce frames for local reinforcement. The wing used the RAF 19 section, modified by the inclusion of a in (10 mm) step in the upper surface. The thin wing section dictated the use of four spars, these being box sections with spruce flanges and 3-ply webs, and was built in three sections, the sections outboard of the propeller shafts being removable for ease of transportation. The wing had a parallel-chord centre section and outer sections with the leading edge swept-back to meet the fourth wing spar at the tip. The engine was mounted on duralumin bearers between the two centre spars. Wide-span ailerons were hinged to the rearmost wing spar, operated by torque-tubes with dog clutches at the junction between the centre section and the removable outer panels. The fixed undercarriage consisted of a pair of wheels on a short axle carried inside the fuselage, the lower part of the wheels projecting through slots. Two aircraft were built by Shorts and the first one, registered G-EBGN, first flew on 26 May 1923 piloted by Short test pilot John Lankester Parker. The second aircraft was unregistered and was flown at Lympne as No. 19, it crashed at Cramlington on 18 June 1926 killing the pilot.

There is another \\"Rothschild Hours\\", made in Rouen c. 1465, see Auction catalogue is an important Flemish illuminated manuscript book of hours, compiled c. 1500‚Äì20 by a number of artists.Dates vary - 1500-1510 here, 1510-1520 according to Walther and Norbert, and Finns. It has 254 folios, with a page size of 228 √ó 160 mm. It was once in the Austrian National Library in Vienna as Codex Vindobonensis S.N. 2844. Since its sale in 1999 it has held the world record price at auction for an illuminated manuscript. In 2014 it was purchased by Australian businessman Kerry Stokes from Christie's New York and is on display in the National Library of Australia. Illuminations Rothschild Prayerbook, two-page opening It contains the work of several leading miniaturists of the final flowering of the Ghent-Bruges school of Flemish illumination, who also co-operated on the Grimani Breviary, the Spinola Hours (Malibu) and other major manuscripts of these years. Most of the sixty-seven large miniatures are by the \\"Master of the First Prayerbook of Maximilian\\", an older artist, and Gerard Horenbout or the Master of James IV of Scotland (these being two names probably for the same artist).Kren & McKendrick prefer to use Master of James IV of Scotland, accepting he was very likely Horenbout Other miniatures are by Gerard David, better known as a panel painter, or a pupil working in his style, with two miniatures by Simon Bening, and other work by further masters. There are wide borders, many with flowers and other objects and drolleries, and another group with trompe l'oeil imitations of bronzes. Other borders frame the miniature with illusionistically painted wooden tracery.These are discussed in Sacred Image and Illusion in Late Flemish Manuscripts, Robert G. Calkins, Cornell University. Some pages follow the fashion of showing one scene as a framed inset within another larger one, In total 140 pages, over half of the whole book, have significant decoration outside the text. The calendar has scenes of the Labours of the Months at the bottom of the pages.Walther and Norbert, 416-417 As with other very lavishly illuminated manuscripts, it was probably worked on over a long period. History The early history of the book is obscure, and the original owner is unknown, though he or she would clearly have been a very wealthy person. This is a feature shared by several important manuscripts of the late Ghent-Bruges school, where typically the heraldry and portraits of the owners of most luxury manuscripts are not found.Kren & McKendrick The contents of the book, which has extra mass texts and prayers beyond those usually found in a book of hours, contain distinctive elements that relate it to the Chartreuse des Dunes, near Bruges. By 1500 the printed book of hours had largely replaced manuscript ones, except for luxury books like this, which were restricted to the higher nobility and royalty. The manuscript belonged to the princely Wittelsbach family in the 16th century, and then to the library of the counts palatine in Heidelberg, leaving that collection before 1623. Its history is then unknown until it reappeared in the collection of the Viennese branch of the Rothschild family in the late 19th century. It was confiscated from Louis Nathaniel von Rothschild immediately after the March 1938 German annexation of Austria. After the end of World War II, the new Austrian government used legislation forbidding the export of culturally significant works of art in part to pressure the Rothschilds into \\"donating\\" a large number of works to Austrian museums, including the prayerbook, which went to the National Library. In exchange the family was allowed to export other works.The Rothschild Affair: A Test of Austria's Conscience The Wall Street Journal, July 6, 1999, p. A13 Under international pressure over this and similar disputes, the government of Austria returned the book and other works of art to the Rothschild family in 1999. The book was sold for them by Christie's auction house in London on July 8, 1999 for ¬£8,580,000 (then $13,400,000), still the world record auction price for an illuminated manuscript. The prayerbook was offered for sale again at Christie's, New York, 29 January 2014 when it fetched ¬£8,195,783. The bidder remained anonymous until September 2014, when it was revealed on the Australian TV program Sunday Night that Kerry Stokes, an Australian businessman, billionaire and owner of the Seven Network that Sunday Night airs on, had purchased it. The Prayerbook is part of Stokes' collection in Perth, Australia and was loaned to the National Library of Australia in Canberra for display. A full facsimile has been published: E.

History of the channel The Youth Channel Television group, which operates the Belgian channels AB3 and AB4, entered negotiations in 2004 with the communications agency (CSA) of the French Community of Belgium to obtain a new broadcasting licence. Named AB5, the projected new channel presented the agency with the chance to become the Belgian version of AB1, with a target market of 15/25 years old and showing a mix of manga and music. AB Groupe, which controlled YTV, proposed other channels for the TVI SA group to rival the RTL Group in Belgium: AB3, a general channel to rival RTL-TVI, AB4, a grown-up channel to rival Club RTL and AB5, the youth channel in competition with Plug TV. Although Claude Berda, head of AB Groupe, was still in conflict with the Audiovisual council over his non-cooperation with certain regulations with AB3 in 2001 and 2002, the members of the CSA awarded a 9-year licence to AB5 on 18 February 2005. The launch of the channel took place without any agreement being reached with a cable broadcaster. The broadcast tests took place over Id√©atel (around Mons) with the channel opening by showing pop videos for a few days, on Igeho (Hainaut Occidental) and channel 72, with the channel showing a black screen for a few days, and on Coditel from February 2005 to August 2006. In September 2006, the channel was officially launched under the name La Quatre and radically changed from the ideas underlying AB4 at its creation, so that it became a channel showing cult series from the 60s, 70s and 80s, and also classic films. The change of name allowed AB Groupe to re-use programmes originally shown in 2005 on NT1 via digital television in France on the new \\"La Quatre\\". It also allowed the channel to place itself directly after the three main channels of the RTBF, as the fourth francophone Belgian channel, in place of RTL-TVI, which returned to Luxembourg in 2005. Failing to find an audience, and very similar to AB4, AB Groupe decided to stop showing \\"La Quatre\\" on 3 April 2007. On 3 April 2007, Vid√©oclick took over from La Quatre (formerly AB5) and became a channel based around a website.  Organisation Managers= Pr√©sident : *Rolland Berda =Capital= Vid√©oclick is owned 100% by BTV SA (formerly YTV), financed 49% by AB Groupe, and Ipercast SA. Programmes Formerly, La Quatre showed similar programmes to AB4, i.e., serials, series, and old films. There was no call-TV and no teleshopping. When call-TV and teleshopping was shown on AB4, La Quatre showed old series. To start with, the programmes shown on AB4, (including call-TV and teleshopping) were shown at the same time on La Quatre. Sometimes La Quatre showed the same programmes but delayed by a few days. La Quatre started showing pop videos in March 2007 until midday, and repeated these programmes in the evening. Currently, Vid√©oclick shows short advertising films, humorous videos, short clips, films, which are also available on the channel's website.

The action was fought as part of the blockade of Guadeloupe and neighbouring Martinique by a large British Royal Navy squadron, which was seeking to cut the islands off from contact and supplies from France by preventing the passage of shipping from Europe to the islands. The British blockade was part of their preparation for planned invasions during the next year. The French made numerous efforts to supply their colonies during this period, attempting to use fast frigates to bring food and military stores to the Caribbean past the British blockades, themselves a response to Napoleon's Continental System, but often losing the vessels in the process. One such attempt was made by the French frigate Topaze, despatched from Brest to Cayenne with a large cargo of flour. Driven away from Cayenne by Portugal (allies of Britain, and fighting France themselves in be Peninsular War), who had recently captured the colony, Topaze took refuge under the gun batteries of Guadeloupe. Discovered at anchor off Pointe-Noire on 22 January by the British brig HMS Hazard, Topaze was isolated and attacked by two British frigates, led by Captain Samuel Pechell in HMS Cleopatra. In the ensuing engagement, the British ships outnumbered and overwhelmed their opponent, capturing the ship and her cargo, despite heavy fire from a French gun battery that overlooked the anchorage. The British ships were drawn from a force gathered for the impending invasion of Martinique, which was launched six days after Topaze had been captured and successfully completed in a campaign lasting just over three weeks. Background By the summer of 1808, the Napoleonic Wars were five years old and the British Royal Navy‚Äîwhose success during the 1793‚Äì1801 French Revolutionary Wars had continued into the new conflict‚Äîwas dominant at sea. In an effort to restrict French movement and trade, the British fleet actively blockaded French ports, maintaining squadrons of fast frigates and large ships of the line off every important French harbour and smaller warships off less significant anchorages to intercept any vessel that attempted to enter or leave.Gardiner, p. 17 This strategy was practised across the French Empire, particularly in the West Indies, where lucrative British trade routes were at constant risk from raiding French warships and privateers. As a result, the economies of the French colonies, especially the islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe, collapsed and their food stocks, military supplies and morale all began to run low. Messages requesting assistance from France were despatched but many were intercepted by British ships, convincing the Admiralty to order invasions of the French colonies.Clowes, p. 283 During late 1808 and early 1809 therefore, expeditionary forces were sent to occupy the smaller colonies while a major army and naval fleet were assembled on Barbados under Sir Alexander Cochrane in readiness for an attack on Martinique.Woodman, p. 242 In France, news of the situation in the West Indies forced the authorities to take action. During the autumn of 1808, a number of ships were despatched carrying much needed food and military supplies, but several were intercepted, including the frigate Th√©tis, captured during the Action of 10 November 1808 in the Bay of Biscay.James, p. 82 Despite the losses, some ships did reach their destination intact and further supply ships were prepared, including the frigate Topaze, ordered to transport 1,100 barrels of flour to Cayenne. The cargo was loaded during late November and early December, the frigate also carrying military supplies and 100 soldiers to augment the Cayenne garrison. The ship, under the command of Captain Pierre-Nicolas Lahalle, was only three years old and carried 40 heavy guns.James, p. 148 In early December 1808, Topaze departed Brest and travelled across the Atlantic, encountering the British frigate HMS Loire in the Bay of Biscay. Loire fired on Topaze, but was unable to catch her and, despite minor damage, the French ship was able to reach the Caribbean without further incident.Clowes, p. 431 Nearing Cayenne on 13 January 1809, Lahalle was surprised to see the small British ship HMS Confiance emerge from the harbour and manoeuvre threateningly towards his ship. Realising that Cayenne was in British hands, he turned and sailed northwards, concerned that stronger British forces might be nearby. In fact Confiance was the only British ship in the vicinity and she was severely underarmed, with a crew of just 47 men, including 20 local inhabitants recruited on the spot. The colony had been captured just three days earlier by a combined British and Portuguese expeditionary force under Captain James Lucas Yeo.James, p. 213 Battle With Cayenne under British control, Topaze made all speed for Guadeloupe, Lahalle intending to land his food supplies and reinforcements on French held territory before attempting the return journey to Europe. For nine days Topaze crossed the Caribbean without encountering any British warships, but at 07:00 on 22 January she was spotted approaching Guadeloupe from the southwest by the brig HMS Hazard under Captain Hugh Cameron, which was part of a squadron detached from Cochrane's invasion fleet on Barbados to watch the French islands. Although his lookouts had also sighted a French schooner close inshore, Cameron gave orders for his brig to close with the much larger French frigate instead. Within two hours, Hazard was joined by the frigates HMS Cleopatra under Captain Samuel Pechell and HMS Jason under Captain William Maude. Although both ships were smaller than Topaze, together they held a considerable advantage over the overladen French ship.Gardiner, p. 78 With Hazard approaching from the northeast, Cleopatra from the southeast and Jason from the south, Lahalle had only one clear route available, eastwards directly towards Guadeloupe. By 11:00, Topaze was offshore, sheltering in the anchorage off Pointe-Noire, which was protected by a small gun battery manned by soldiers from the island's garrison. Over the next three and a half hours, the British ships steadily approached the bay, hampered by light winds. The breeze strengthened at 14:30 and by 16:30 Cleopatra was close enough for Topaze to open fire on her from . Under fire, Pechell manoeuvered into an advantageous position off Topaze's bow and began to fire on his opponent, shooting away one of the French ship's anchors. This caused her to swing with her bow towards the shore and Cleopatra was able to repeatedly rake Lahalle's ship from close range. Severely damaged, Topaze was unable to effectively respond, the only serious danger to the British ships coming from the battery onshore.James, p. 149 By 17:10 Jason and Hazard had joined Cleopatra, the brig bombarding the battery while Jason opened fire on the other side of the French ship, causing further damage. Recognising that his situation was hopeless, Lahalle surrendered at 17:20. As the French colours fell, approximately a third of the 430 soldiers and sailors on board Topaze attempted to escape captivity by diving overboard and swimming for the shore. Many drowned, and more were killed when Jason opened fire on the swimmers, although exact losses in the water are unknown. The remainder of the survivors, including Lahalle, totalled almost 300 men and were all made prisoners of war. The badly damaged Topaze was towed out of the bay and taken to a British port for repairs. Aftermath With the exception of the aforementioned Topaze, casualties were minimal: none were recorded on Jason and Hazard and none in the French battery on shore. Cleopatra, due to the poor position and accuracy of her opponent, lost only two men killed and one wounded, the most serious damage being to her masts and rigging, which were badly cut up. Losses among the French that didn't attempt to flee crew in the engagement were also relatively light, with 12 dead and 14 wounded, although a number of men were killed in their attempt to swim for shore after Topaze had surrendered. The French frigate was badly damaged, particularly in her hull, and required extensive repairs before she was fit for service in the Royal Navy, commissioned under the new name of HMS Alcmene. On 28 January, Cochrane's fleet at Barbados, including Jason, Cleopatra and Hazard, sailed for Martinique, arriving two days later and conducting successful landings at three points on the island. Within a week, all of the French colony was in British hands except for Fort Desaix, which held out for a further three weeks before surrendering after a heavy bombardment.Clowes, p. 284 The following month, a major reinforcement fleet arrived from France but was unable to affect the situation on Martinique and anchored in √éles des Saintes, a small archipelago to the south of Guadeloupe. There they were blockaded and attacked by Cochrane's squadron and in the ensuing Action of 14‚Äì17 April 1809 were defeated, with the ship of the line Haupoult captured and the remainder driven back to Europe. Two frigates reached Guadeloupe, but both were later captured. Subsequent attempts to resupply Guadeloupe, the only remaining French position in the West Indies, were made during 1809, and a squadron under Commodore Francois Roquebert managed to capture a British frigate at the Action of 13 December 1809. However, this force was intercepted by a British blockade squadron near Guadeloupe at the Action of 18 December 1809 and defeated, with two frigates destroyed and two others forced to return to Europe without reaching their destination.Gardiner, p. 79 Guadeloupe was subsequently invaded in January 1810 and captured, ending direct French interest in the Americas during the Napoleonic Wars.Gardiner, p. 80 NotesReferences  * Category:Conflicts in 1809 Category:1800s in the Caribbean Category:History of Guadeloupe Category:Naval battles of the Napoleonic Wars Category:Naval battles involving France Category:Naval battles involving the United Kingdom Category:19th century in Guadeloupe Category:January 1809 events ","title":"Action of 22 January 1809"},{"id":"21692935","text":"The Catholic News Agency (CNA) is an institution of EWTN that provides news related to the Catholic Church to the global anglophone audience.

F. 1988. Grass tetany. In: Church, D. C. (ed.). The ruminant animal: digestive physiology and nutrition. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N. J. pp. 511-523. usually after grazing on pastures of rapidly growing grass, especially in early spring.  Symptoms and cause  Progressive symptoms may include grazing away from the herd, irritability, muscle twitching, staring, incoordination, staggering, collapse, thrashing, head thrown back, and coma, followed by death. However, clinical signs are not always evident before the animal is found dead.Grass tetany. Kansas State Univ. Research and Extension, Forage Facts series. http://www.ksre.ksu.edu/forage/pubs/97notebook/fora15.pdf The condition results from hypomagnesemia (low magnesium concentration in blood) which may reflect low magnesium intake, low magnesium absorption, unusually low retention of magnesium, or a combination of these. Commonly, apparent symptoms develop only when hypomagnesemia is accompanied by hypocalcemia (blood Ca below 8 mg/dL). Low magnesium intake by grazing ruminants may occur especially with some grass species early in the growing season, due to seasonally low magnesium concentrations in forage dry matter.Rendig, V. V. and D. L. Grunes (eds.) 1979. Grass tetany. ASA Spec. Publ. 35, Am. Soc. Agron., Madison, Wisc. 175 pp. Some conserved forages are also low in magnesium and may be conducive to hypomagnesemia.Mehren, M. Winter tetany and grass tetany http://www.oregonfeed.org/mehren_art_0205.htm High potassium intake relative to calcium and magnesium intake may induce hypomagnesemia. A K/(Ca+Mg) charge ratio exceeding 2.2 in forages has been commonly considered a risk factor for grass tetany. Potassium fertilizer application to increase forage production may contribute to an increased K/(Ca+Mg) ratio in forage plants, not only by adding potassium to soil, but also by displacing soil-adsorbed calcium and magnesium by ion exchange, contributing to increased susceptibility of calcium and magnesium to leaching loss from the root zone during rainy seasons. In ruminants, high potassium intake results in decreased absorption of magnesium from the digestive tract.Wylie, M. J., J. P. Fontenot and L. W. Greene. 1985. Absorption of magnesium and other macrominerals in sheep infused with potassium in different parts of the digestive tract. J. Anim. Sci. 61: 1219‚Äì1229Schonewille, J. T., A. T. Van't Klooster, H. Wouterse and A. C. Beynen. 1999. Effects of intrinsic potassium in artificially dried grass and supplemental potassium bicarbonate on apparent magnesium absorption in dry cows. J. Dairy Sci. 82: 1824‚Äì1830. Trans-aconitate, which accumulates in some grasses, can be a risk factor for hypomagnesemia in grazing ruminants. (Tetany has been induced in cattle by administration of trans-aconitate and KCl, where the amount of KCl used was, by itself, insufficient to induce tetany.Bohman, V. R., A. L. Lesperance, G. D. Harding and D. L. Grunes. 1969. Induction of experimental tetany in cattle. J. Anim. Sci. 29: 99-102.) Relatively high levels of trans-aconitate have been found in several forage species on rangeland sites conducive to hypomagnesemia.Stout, P.R., J. Brownell and R. J. Burau. 1967. Occurrences of trans-aconitate in range forage species. Agron. J. 59: 21-24. Although at least one rumen organism converts trans-aconitate to acetate,Cook, G. M., J. E. Wells and J. B. Russell 1994.

Enrichment and isolation of rumen bacteria that reduce trans-aconitic acid to tricarballylic acid. Appl. Env. Microbiol. 49: 120-126. Using rats as an animal model, oral administration of tricarballylate has been shown to reduce an animal's magnesium retention.Schwartz, R., M. Topley and J. B. Russell. 1988.

Potassium effects on minerals and organic acids in three cool-season grasses. J. Plant Nutr. 15: 1007‚Äì1025.  Prevention  Magnesium supplements are used to prevent the disease when ruminants, for obvious economic reasons, must have access to dangerous pastures.  Treatment  The affected animal should be left in the pasture, and not forced to come back to stall because excitation can darken the prognosis, even after adequate treatment. Intravenous mixed calcium and magnesium injection are used. Subcutaneous injection of magnesium sulfate (200 ml of 50% solution) is also recommended.  Epidemiology  In Northern Europe, the disease occurs after winter housing. But in Australia and New Zealand, where the cows are not housed, the disease occurs in similar conditions, when the animal enters lush, grass-dominant pastures. In North America, grass tetany occurs most commonly when range stock are moved onto lush early pasture or when housed stock are turned out onto such pasture in the spring. A second high-risk period may occur in the fall. Although cereal grasses (e.g. winter wheat) and crested wheatgrass may be especially conducive to grass tetany, the problem can also occur with several other grass species. \\"Winter tetany\\" may occur with some silages,Kahn, M.

The Siege of Limoges was laid by the English army led by Edward the Black Prince in the second week in September. On 19 September, the town was taken by storm, followed by much destruction and the deaths of numerous civilians. The sack effectively ended the Limoges enamel industry, which had been famous across Europe, for around a century.  The attackers  The Anglo-Gascon force was not large but was led by three sons of Edward III; Edward, Prince of Wales; John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster; and Edmund of Langley, Earl of Cambridge. Edward was a sick man and was carried on litter. They were accompanied by experienced soldiers John Hastings, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, Sir Walter Hewitt, Guichard d'Angle and the Captal de Buch.Sumption (2009), p. 81. The army was small, about 3200 strong, comprising approximately 1000 men-at-arms, 1000 archers and 1200 infantry.  The defenders  By the time of the siege, the Duke of Berry had left Limoges with most of his army, leaving a small garrison of 140 men. According to Jean Froissart, Jean de Cros, Bishop of Limoges, played a large role in assisting the surrender to the Duke of Berry.Chronicle, Book I, chapter 288 Sir John Villemur, Hugh de la Roche and Roger Beaufont are described in terms of putting up a last stand in against the English in a town square and were captured when the town fell. Sack and massacre Froissart alleges that Edward was put into a \\"violent passion\\" in which he declared that regaining Limoges and punishing the French for its capture would be his singular goal. When the city wall fell, Froissart mentions the massacre of three thousand inhabitants‚Äîmen, women and children‚Äîbreaching the rules of chivalry and Edward still \\"inflamed with passion and revenge\\". Three captured French knights appealed to John of Gaunt and the Earl of Cambridge for being treated \\"according to the law of arms\\" and turned prisoners. Froissart's account is sometimes challenged as French bias. Froissart had worked for the English court, being in the service of Philippa of Hainault, queen consort of Edward III of England, but at the time he wrote he was employed by Guy de Ch√¢tillon, Count of Blois. Jim Bradbury does not dispute Froissart's account but simply states that Limoges was \\"not an exceptional atrocity\\". Richard Barber, in his biography of the Black Prince, notes that a contemporary source from Limoges only records 300 civilian casualties and other period sources don't mention civilian deaths at all, concentrating on property damage.Barber (1978), pp. 225-226. Jonathan Sumption also records that casualties may have been 300 civilians, \\"perhaps a sixth of the normal population\\", plus 60 members of the garrison. A recently discovered and previously unread letter from Edward, the Black Prince to Gaston III, Count of Foix has cast further doubt on Froissart's claims. The letter states that 200 prisoners were taken but mentions no civilian deaths. Sean McGlynn, in his study of atrocity in Medieval warfare By Sword and Fire, examines the evidence for the massacre and concludes that it was notable as major urban areas were rarely devastated as completely as Limoges. He identifies a complex interplay of reasons behind Edward's actions, including a desire to punish the perceived treachery of the city, a frustration that he could not prevent his territories from falling under the control of the French, the effects of his illness and a desire to liquidate the wealth of Limoges and carry it away, because he could not defend it. Michael Jones reviews the evidence in an appendix of his biography of the Black Prince. He finds that the archaeological and documentary evidence points to widespread property destruction and that there were civilian casualties but not at the level Froissart states, quoting a range of sources giving the killed and captured among citizens and garrison between 200-400. He believes Froissart's account should be dismissed as a \\"slur\\". Jones (2017), pp. 405-408.

It is located on the northeast coast of Raspberry Island in the Kodiak Archipelago, along the western shores of the Gulf of Alaska. The community was established in the 1930s by Lee Howard Wakefield as a herring reduction plant after he relocated the family's salmon cannery business, Apex Fish Company, from Anacortes, Washington and renamed the company Wakefield Fisheries. Lee's sons Howard, Lavern and Lowell began fishing for and processing experimentally for king crab in 1939. Lowell Wakefield, who is regarded as the founder of the Alaskan king crab industry, introduced flash frozen cooked king crab, partly because of declining herring stocks in surrounding waters. As well as the processing plant and cold storage, cedar log houses and a schoolhouse were added to the existing village for the workers and their families, with a population of approximately 100. Port Wakefield suffered badly in the 1964 Alaska earthquake and tsunami, when Raspberry Island subsided by as much as six feet. This was the most powerful recorded earthquake in North American history, and the third most powerful ever measured by seismograph; with a moment magnitude of 9.2 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of XI (Extreme). The town was not destroyed, but the cannery and community were no longer viable. The land was eventually purchased and is now used for tourism, as wilderness lodges. The crab plant was relocated to Port Lions on Kodiak Island, in a much more accessible location, with a good dock and harbor facilities. The plant was connected to Port Lions by a long causeway and a new road. Some of the cedar log houses were moved on barges from Port Wakefield to Port Lions, where they still stand. However, the plant burnt down and has not been rebuilt.

It was originally coined in reference to the use of limited proteolysis to investigate contact sites within a monoclonal antibody - protein antigen complex and a year later to examine the protection from hydroxyl radical cleavage conferred by a protein bound to DNA within a DNA-protein complex. In DNA footprinting the protein is envisioned to make an imprint (or footprint) at a particular point of interaction. This latter method was adapted through the direct treatment of proteins and their complexes with hydroxyl radicals. Hydroxyl radical protein footprinting Time-resolved hydroxyl radical protein footprinting employing mass spectrometry analysis was developed in the late 1990s in synchrotron radiolysis studies. The same year, these authors reported on the use of an electrical discharge source to effect the oxidation of proteins on millisecond timescales as proteins pass from the electrosprayed solution into the mass spectrometer. These approaches have since been used to determine protein structures, protein folding, protein dynamics, and protein‚Äìprotein interactions. Unlike nucleic acids, proteins oxidize rather than cleave on these timescales. Analysis of the products by mass spectrometry reveals that proteins to are oxidized in a limited manner (some 10‚Äì30% of total protein) at a number of amino acid side chains across the proteins. The rate or level of oxidation at the reactive amino acid side chains (Met, Cys, Trp, Tyr, Phe, His, Pro and Leu) provides a measure of their accessibility to the bulk solvent. The mechanisms of side chain oxidation were explored by performing the radiolysis reactions in 18O-labeled water. Producing OH radicals A critical feature of these experiments is the need to expose proteins to hydroxyl radicals for limited timescales on the order of 1‚Äì50 ms inducing 10-30% oxidation of total protein. A further requirement is to generate hydroxyl radicals from the bulk solvent (i.e. water) (equations 1 and 2) not hydrogen peroxide which can remain to oxidize proteins even without other stimuli. : H2O ‚Üí H2O+‚Ä¢ \\\\+ e‚àí \\\\+ H2O* : H2O+‚Ä¢ \\\\+ H2O ‚Üí H3O+ \\\\+ OH‚Ä¢ Hydroxyl radicals can be produced in solution by an electrical discharge within a conventional atmospheric pressure electrospray ionization (ESI) source. When a high voltage difference (~8 keV) is held between an electrospray needle and a sampling orifice to the mass analyzer, radicals can be produced in solution at the electrospray needle tip. This method was the first employed to apply protein footprinting to the study of a protein complex. Method The exposure of proteins to a \\"white\\" X-ray beam of synchrotron light or an electrical discharge for tens of milliseconds provides sufficient oxidative modification to the surface amino acid side chains without damage to the protein structure. These products can be easily detected and quantified by mass spectrometry. By adjusting the time for radiolysis or which protein ions spend in the discharge source, a time-resolved approach is possible which is valuable for the study of protein dynamics. Analysis A computer program (PROXIMO) has also been written to help model protein complexes using data from the RP-MS/Protein footprinting approach. RP-MS/Protein footprinting studies of protein complexes can also employ computational approaches to assist with this modeling. Applications The application of ion mobility mass spectrometry has conclusively demonstrated that the conditions employed in RP-MS/Protein footprinting experiments do not alter the structure of proteins. Other studies have extended the method to study early onset protein damage given the radical basis of the method and the significance of oxygen based radicals in the pathogenesis of many diseases including neurological disorders and even blindness.

For a larger sphere, the band will be thinner but longer. Animation of a cut napkin ring with constant height In geometry, the napkin-ring problem involves finding the volume of a \\"band\\" of specified height around a sphere, i.e. the part that remains after a hole in the shape of a circular cylinder is drilled through the center of the sphere. It is a counterintuitive fact that this volume does not depend on the original sphere's radius but only on the resulting band's height. The problem is so called because after removing a cylinder from the sphere, the remaining band resembles the shape of a napkin ring.  Statement  Suppose that the axis of a right circular cylinder passes through the center of a sphere of radius R and that h represents the height (defined as the distance in a direction parallel to the axis) of the part of the cylinder that is inside the sphere. The \\"band\\" is the part of the sphere that is outside the cylinder. The volume of the band depends on h but not on R: : V=\\\\frac{\\\\pi h^3}{6}. As the radius R of the sphere shrinks, the diameter of the cylinder must also shrink in order that h can remain the same. The band gets thicker, and this would increase its volume. But it also gets shorter in circumference, and this would decrease its volume. The two effects exactly cancel each other out. In the extreme case of the smallest possible sphere, the cylinder vanishes (its radius becomes zero) and the height h equals the diameter of the sphere. In this case the volume of the band is the volume of the whole sphere, which matches the formula given above. An early study of this problem was written by 17th-century Japanese mathematician Seki K≈çwa. According to , Seki called this solid an arc-ring, or in Japanese kokan or kokwan.  Proof  Suppose the radius of the sphere is R and the length of the cylinder (or the tunnel) is h. By the Pythagorean theorem, the radius of the cylinder is Finding the measurements of the ring that is the horizontal cross-section. : \\\\sqrt{R^2 - \\\\left(\\\\frac{h}{2}\\\\right)^2},\\\\qquad\\\\qquad(1) and the radius of the horizontal cross-section of the sphere at height y above the \\"equator\\" is : \\\\sqrt{R^2 - y^2}.\\\\qquad\\\\qquad(2) The cross-section of the band with the plane at height y is the region inside the larger circle of radius given by (2) and outside the smaller circle of radius given by (1). The cross-section's area is therefore the area of the larger circle minus the area of the smaller circle: : \\\\begin{align} & {}\\\\quad \\\\pi(\\\\text{larger radius})^2 - \\\\pi(\\\\text{smaller radius})^2  & = \\\\pi\\\\left(\\\\sqrt{R^2 - y^2}\\\\right)^2 - \\\\pi\\\\left(\\\\sqrt{R^2 - \\\\left(\\\\frac{h}{2}\\\\right)^2\\\\,{}}\\\\,\\\\right)^2 = \\\\pi\\\\left(\\\\left(\\\\frac{h}{2}\\\\right)^2 - y^2\\\\right). \\\\end{align} The radius R does not appear in the last quantity. Therefore, the area of the horizontal cross-section at height y does not depend on R, as long as y ‚â§ ‚â§ R. The volume of the band is : \\\\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} (\\\\text{area of cross-section at height }y) \\\\, dy, and that does not depend on R. This is an application of Cavalieri's principle: volumes with equal-sized corresponding cross-sections are equal. Indeed, the area of the cross-section is the same as that of the corresponding cross-section of a sphere of radius h/2, which has volume : \\\\frac{4}{3}\\\\pi\\\\left(\\\\frac{h}{2}\\\\right)^3 = \\\\frac{\\\\pi h^3}{6}.

He worked as organist in various churches in Erfurt: Reglerkirche, Andreaskirche, and Kaufmannskirche. He died in Erfurt at the age of 29.Sharp, Grove. Armsdorff's early death was not an obstacle to the posthumous popularity of his music. His organ chorale preludes survive in numerous manuscript copies that circulated in Germany for decades after Armsdorff's death. Writing in 1758, Jakob Adlung praised Armsdorff's music as \\"agreeable to the ear.\\"Apel 1972, 679. He was particularly known for his fugal writing, and traces of advanced imitative technique are present in the surviving works, particularly the two chorale preludes that employ the rare form of chorale canon: Allein Gott in der H√∂h and Es spricht der Unweisen Mund. Armsdorff mostly employed typical Central German chorale styles, however, in a few pieces he used the ornamented descant type, more widespread in the North (Allein zu dir, Herr Jesu Christ). Today, some 30 chorale preludes for organ are the only surviving pieces by Armsdorff, although there is evidence of lost vocal works, as well as numerous keyboard pieces.

Prior to that he was an American football coach for the Canton Professionals-Bulldogs of the \\"Ohio League\\", which was the direct predecessor to the modern National Football League, as well as the head football and basketball coach at Canton McKinley High School. He was fired as the head coach of the Canton Bulldogs, by manager Jack Cusack, after he benched Canton rookie Jim Thorpe for the first game of the 1915 league title game. The first game in the two-game series resulted in a 16‚Äì0 victory over the Bulldogs by their rivals, the Massillon Tigers. It is unknown why Hazlett benched Thorpe. Some historians feel it was due to Thorpe not having time to practice with the team, while others feel that he was resentful of Thorpe's high salary. After Hazlett was fired, the Bulldogs' quarterback, Don Hamilton, left the team in protest. Thorpe was later named the team's new head coach and led the Bulldogs to the 1915 championship, which was split between Canton and Massillon. Biography Hazlett joined the Ohio National Guard as a captain in 1916 and participated in the Mexican Expedition. During World War I, he served as a machine gun officer and was cited for bravery. After the war, he taught at the University of Akron and the University of Dayton as a Professor of Military Science and Tactics. Before World War II, Hazlett attended the Army War College and published a paper, Procurement and Processing during the Voluntary Enlistment Period of Initial Mobilization, in 1933. Then Lt. Colonel Hazlett served as an instructor at the Army Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth from 1935 to 1936. During 1945, Hazlett served as Commanding General of the Replacement and School Command. In June 1946, he succeeded Major General Paul J. Mueller as commander of the 86th Infantry Division. He commanded the division until it was deactivated in December 1946 on Leyte, Philippines. After commanding the 86th, he was the Post Commander at Yokohama, Japan until 1947. In retirement Hazlett lived in California. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

If passed and signed into law, marijuana would be sold and taxed openly to adults age 21 and older in California. Tom Ammiano, a Democrat representing California's 13th State Assembly district, introduced this piece of legislation on February 23, 2009, arguing that the bill will \\"tax and regulate marijuana in a manner similar to alcohol.\\" As introduced, this proposal is estimated to raise over $1 billion in annual revenue by taxing the retail production and sale of marijuana for adults 21 years of age and older. To obtain a commercial grow license one would pay an initial $5,000 fee, then a $2,500 fee each year after that. A tariff of $50 per ounce would also be placed on all sold and grown marijuana. The bill has gained much media attention, statewide and nationally. The bill was not approved by the Health Committee before a January 15 deadline, effectively killing the bill until it was reintroduced in 2010 as A.B. 2254 and the process continued. Recent polls say 56% of Californians favor taxing and regulating marijuana. In November 2010, the failed Proposition 19 was posed to Californian voters, and would have effectively made possession and cultivation of marijuana legal for citizens over the age of 21. The bill was reintroduced as Marijuana Control and Regulation Act of 2010 in slightly different form as Assembly Bill x6 9http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/09-10/bill/asm/ab_0001-0050/abx6_9_bill_20100921_introduced.pdf  Introduction of the bill  Democrat Tom Ammiano from the California State Assembly's 13th district, introduced the Marijuana Control, Regulation and Education Act during the California budget crisis. The bill is designed to raise revenue for the state, but it also provides funding for the education of discouraging substance abuse, as mentioned in the name. As Mr. Ammiano introduced the bill, he is quoted saying: A UC Santa Cruz study shows that people living in Cannabis-tolerant cities like Amsterdam and San Francisco are no more or less likely to use the drug. Prominent economists, specifically Jeffrey Miron, support the regulation of Cannabis due to the heavy violence across the U.S. and Mexico border. Economists argue that regulation would put infamous drug cartels, especially Los Zetas, out of business, improve safety standards and allow for more open research about the drug. Cannabis is also believed to be California's number one cash crop. In California, marijuana is a $14-billion black market, putting it above vegetables ($5.7 billion) and grapes ($2.6 billion). AB 390 is projected to allow an additional economic benefit of $12 ‚Äì18 billion. = Proponents = * Orange County Superior Court Judge James Gray estimates that legalizing marijuana and thus ceasing to arrest, prosecute, and imprison nonviolent offenders could \\"save the state $1 billion a year.\\" * Marijuana law reform groups such as Drug Policy Alliance, NORML, Marijuana Policy Project and Campaign Against Marijuana Prohibition CAMP 420 also support the bill. = Opponents = * John Lovell, lobbyist for the California Correctional Peace Officers Association, opposes the bill and is quoted saying \\"the last thing we need is another mind-altering substance to be legalized.\\"  Timeline  2009 = A.B. 390 * February 23 ‚Äî Read for the first time.

The crew of Essex escaped in small whaleboats, with sufficient supplies for two months, but were not rescued within that time. During January 1821, the near-starved survivors began to eat the bodies of those who had died. When even this resource ran out, the four men remaining in Pollard's boat agreed to draw straws to decide which of them should be slaughtered, lest all four die of starvation. Coffin 'lost' the lottery, and was shot and eaten. The captain volunteered to take Coffin's place but Coffin refused, saying it was his 'right' to do so that the others might live. Coffin was the son of Nancy (Bunker) and Hezekiah Coffin. He is a direct lineal descendant of Tristram Coffin, Sr, one of the colonizers of Nantucket Island.  In popular culture  *The title song of the 1971 album Nantucket Sleighride by American rock band Mountain is titled in full \\"Nantucket Sleighride (To Owen Coffin)\\". While there is no evidence that the song is specifically about Coffin or the ship Essex (and the lyrics are in parts obscure in meaning), it is written from the point of view of a sailor on a ship undertaking a \\"three-year tour... on a search for the mighty sperm whale\\", and co-writer Felix Pappalardi, in an interview for the British music weekly Sounds (issue dated November 20, 1971), confirmed that the Owen Coffin in the dedication was the one from the Essex tragedy. *German funeral doom metal band Ahab released The Divinity of Oceans, a concept album about Essex, and one song, Gnawing Bones (Coffin's Lot), directly references Coffin's fate. *The story of the Essex is known to have greatly interested Herman Melville, who annotated a copy of Narrative of the Most Extraordinary and Distressing Shipwreck of the Whale-Ship Essex, an account of the shipwreck and its aftermath by the ship's surviving first mate, Owen Chase. The story inspired part of Melville's novel Moby-Dick. *Owen Coffin was played by British actor Frank Dillane in the 2015 film adaptation of the story of the Essex, In the Heart of the Sea, directed by Ron Howard. In the film, the character was renamed as \\"Henry Coffin\\", presumably to avoid confusion with Owen Chase. *Owen Coffin was played by Jassa Ahluwalia in the BBC film of the true story of the sinking of the whale ship Essex, entitled The Whale.

Peeball  Peeballs are biodegradable compacted- powder balls that can be collected, or placed in gentlemen's urinals and destroyed using the power of the urinary stream. Peeball is available in many retail outlets including the Mitchells & Butlers and Scottish & Newcastle pub chains, Virgin Megastores, River Island, Maplin and Ryman, and via the web. In the UK, Peeballs cost ¬£1.00 with at least 30p of which going directly to the Prostate Cancer Charity. Peeball was conceived as 'a new approach to charitable awareness and fund raising ‚Äì an alternative to the worthy-but-dull badges and key rings that have become the mainstay of charity in retail'. It was created to engage and amuse but also to highlight issues that would never usually be discussed socially or in mainstream media. Peeball has used schoolboy humour to help communicate serious health and awareness messages. The game has been featured on national TV (on This Morning), in radio programmes (including Radio One's Mark and Lard 'playing' the game on air and a feature on the Steve Wright Show), newspapers, magazines and the local press. In addition, the Peeball on-line game has been played more than 26,000,000 times. As a result of its success in the UK ‚Äì Peeball has been adopted for launch by several other national prostate cancer charities.

The 'Remember Me' Weeping Flower sign was created by Sweetapple and given to the charity mainly to provide a permanent memorial to lives lost or blighted through road crashes. It was also intended to provide a poignant warning to other road users regarding the everyday risks of road use. Since its launch over 3,000 Remember Me signs have been placed on Britain's roads and the Weeping Flower image has been used to front various RoadPeace campaigns. These have included projecting the image onto City Hall in London and using it to highlight the connection between Safety Cameras and road deaths by Transport for London.

Following many school performances, it has been performed live on stage at various venues including the Museum of London and The Bull Theatre in London. Rockford's Rock Opera grew from the success of a song released by Sweetapple with the help of Gerry Bron on behalf of Battersea Dogs and Cats Home called \\"Rockford's Christmas\\" which entered the UK singles chart in 2004.  DogMob  DogMob was created with Mobstar Media for Battersea Dogs and Cats Home. Dogmob allows customers to download mobile phone content ‚Äì images, screensavers, mobile wallpapers, ringtones ‚Äì and 'thank you' messages featuring Battersea Dogs currently looking for homes. The concept created a link between the charity and payments for popular dog related mobile content. Supporters visit the DogMob site, select the Battersea Dog they‚Äôd like to adopt, and then text the dog's name to a 'short code' number. (There's a choice of four dogs on the site at any time ‚Äì updated regularly as they find homes ‚Äì together with information about them and how they came to the Dog's Home.) Customers are then sent a link to a wapsite where they can download four pieces of content ‚Äì an animated screensaver, wallpaper certificate, a 'thank you' video and barking ringtone. Customers can also register for free news updates about their adopted dog.  GiveSure  GiveSure is a UK insurance service that gives money to charity each time someone buys a policy. Launched in the UK in 2006, Givesure offers car, home, van and bike insurance. Rather than doing its own underwriting, Givesure is backed by a broker, which searches the underwriting market for competitive quotes. For every policy bought or renewed through Givesure the broker makes a donation to charity of ¬£20 or 10% of the premium, whichever is the greater. Givesure is able to make the charitable donations without loading customers' premiums. This is because it does not spend money on marketing and advertising. The money the company will save from not doing this is passed on to charity.

Live distributed object (also abbreviated as live object) refers to a running instance of a distributed multi-party (or peer-to-peer) protocol, viewed from the object-oriented perspective, as an entity that has a distinct identity, may encapsulate internal state and threads of execution, and that exhibits a well-defined externally visible behavior. Key Concepts The key programming language concepts, as applied to live distributed objects, are defined as follows: * Identity. The identity of a live distributed object is determined by the same factors that differentiate between instances of the same distributed protocol. The object consists of a group of software components physically executing on some set of physical machines and engaged in mutual communication, each executing the distributed protocol code with the same set of essential parameters, such as the name of a multicast group, the identifier of a publish-subscribe topic, the identity of a membership service, etc. Thus, for example, publish-subscribe channels and multicast groups are examples of live distributed objects: for each channel or group, there exists a single instance of a distributed protocol running among all computers sending, forwarding, or receiving the data published in the channel or multicast within the group. In this case, the object's identity is determined by the identifier of the channel or group, qualified with the identity of the distributed system that provides, controls, and manages the given channel or group. In the case of multicast, the identity of the system might be determined, for example, by the address of the membership service (the entity that manages the membership of the multicast group). * Proxies (replicas). The proxy or a replica of a live object is one of the software component instances involved in executing the live object's distributed protocol. The object can thus be alternatively defined as a group of proxies engaged in communication, jointly maintaining some distributed state, and coordinating their operations. The term proxy stresses the fact that a single software component does not in itself constitute an object; rather, it serves as a gateway through which an application can gain access to a certain functionality or behavior that spans across a set of computers. In this sense, the concept of a live distributed object proxy generalizes the notion of a RPC, RMI, or .NET remoting client- side proxy stub. * Behavior. The behavior of a live distributed object is characterized by the set of possible patterns of external interactions that its proxies can engage in with their local runtime environments. These interactions are modeled as exchanges of explicit events (messages). * State. The state of a live distributed object is defined as the sum of all internal, local states of its proxies. By definition, it is distributed and replicated. The different replicas of the object's state may be strongly or only weakly consistent, depending on the protocol semantics: an instance of a consensus protocol will have the state of its replicas strongly consistent, whereas an instance of a leader election protocol will have a weakly consistent state. In this sense, the term live distributed object generalizes the concept of a replicated object; the latter is a specific type of live distributed object that uses a protocol such as Paxos, virtual synchrony, or state machine replication to achieve strong consistency between the internal states of its replicas. The state of a live distributed object should be understood as a dynamic notion: as a point (or consistent cut) in a stream of values, rather than as a particular value located in a given place at a given time. For example, the externally visible state of a leader election object would be defined as the identity of the currently elected leader. The identity is not stored at any particular location; rather, it materializes as a stream of messages of the form elected(x) concurrently produced by the proxies involved in executing this protocol, and concurrently consumed by instances of the application using this protocol, on different machines distributed across the network. * Interfaces (endpoints). The interface of a live distributed object is defined by the types of interfaces exposed by its proxies; these may include event channels and various types of graphical user interfaces. Interfaces exposed by the proxies are referred to as the live distributed object's endpoints. The term endpoint instance refers to a single specific event channel or user interface exposed by a single specific proxy. To say that a live object exposes a certain endpoint means that each of its proxies exposes an instance of this endpoint to its local environment, and each of the endpoint instances carries events of the same types (or binds to the same type of a graphical display). * References. The reference to a live object is a complete set of serialized, portable instructions for constructing its proxy. To dereference a reference means to locally parse and follow these instructions on a particular computer, to produce a running proxy of the live object. Defined this way, a live object reference plays the same role as a Java reference, a C/C++ pointer, or a web service's WSDL description; it contains a complete information sufficient to locate the given object and interact with it. Since live distributed objects may not reside in any particular place (but rather span across a dynamically changing set of computers), the information contained in a live distributed object's reference cannot be limited to just an address. If the object is identified by some sort of a globally unique identifier (as might be the case for publish-subscribe topics or multicast groups), the reference must specify how this identifier is resolved, by recursively embedding a reference to the appropriate name resolution object. * Types. The type of a live distributed object determines the patterns of external interactions with the object; it is determined by the types of endpoints and graphical user interfaces exposed by the object's proxies, and the patterns of events that may occur at the endpoints. The constraints that the object's type places on event patterns may span across the network. For example, type atomic multicast might specify that if an event of the form deliver(x) is generated by one proxy, a similar event must be eventually generated by all non-faulty proxies (proxies that run on computers that never crash, and that never cease to execute or are excluded from the protocol; the precise definition might vary). Much as it is the case for types in Java-like languages, there might exist many very different implementations of the same type. Thus, for example, behavior characteristic to atomic multicast might be exhibited by instances of distributed protocols such as virtual synchrony or Paxos. The semantics and behavior of live distributed objects can be characterized in terms of distributed data flows; the set of messages or events that appear on the instances of a live object's endpoint forms a distributed data flow Ostrowski, K., Birman, K., Dolev, D., and Sakoda, C. (2009). \\"Implementing Reliable Event Streams in Large Systems via Distributed Data Flows and Recursive Delegation\\", 3rd ACM International Conference on Distributed Event-Based Systems (DEBS 2009), Nashville, TN, USA, July 6‚Äì9, 2009, http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~krzys/krzys_debs2009.pdf .Ostrowski, K., Birman, K., Dolev, D.

The term live distributed object was first used informally in a series of presentations given in the fall of 2006 at an ICWS conference,Ostrowski, K., and Birman, K., 'Extensible Web Services Architecture for Notification in Large-Scale Systems', IEEE International Conference on Web Services (ICWS 2006), Chicago, IL, September 2006, http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=4032049.

QuickSilver Scalable Multicast. Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA, November 2006. http://www.researchchannel.org/prog/displayevent.aspx?rID=7870&fID;=2276. and then formally defined in 2007, in an IEEE Internet Computing article.Ostrowski, K., Birman, K., and Dolev, D. (2007). \\"Live Distributed Objects: Enabling the Active Web\\", IEEE Internet Computing, November‚ÄìDecember 2007, 11(6):72-78, http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?isnumber=4376216&arnumber;=4376231. Originally, the term was used to refer to the types of dynamic, interactive Web content that is not hosted on servers in data centers, but rather stored on the end-user's client computers, and internally powered by instances of reliable multicast protocols. The word live expressed the fact that the displayed information is dynamic, interactive, and represents current, fresh, live content that reflects recent updates made by the users (as opposed to static, read-only, and archival content that has been pre-assembled). The word distributed expressed the fact that the information is not hosted, stored at a server in a data center, but rather, it is replicated among the end-user computers, and updated in a peer-to-peer fashion through a stream of multicast messages that may be produced directly by the end-users consuming the content; a more comprehensive discussion of the live object concept in the context of Web development can be found in Krzysztof Ostrowski's Ph.D. dissertation.Ostrowski, K. (2008). \\"Live Distributed Objects\\", Ph.D. Dissertation, Cornell University, http://hdl.handle.net/1813/10881. The more general definition presented above has been first proposed in 2008, in a paper published at the ECOOP conference.Ostrowski, K., Birman, K., Dolev, D., and Ahnn, J. (2008). \\"Programming with Live Distributed Objects\\", Proceedings of the 22nd European Conference on Object-Oriented Programming, Paphos, Cyprus, July 07‚Äì11, 2008, J. Vitek, Ed., Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol. 5142, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg, 463-489, http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1428508.1428536. The extension of the term has been motivated by the need to model live objects as compositions of other objects; in this sense, the concept has been inspired by Smalltalk, which pioneered the uniform perspective that everything is an object, and Jini, which pioneered the idea that services are objects. When applied to live distributed objects, the perspective dictates that their constituent parts, which includes instances of distributed multi-party protocols used internally to replicate state, should also be modeled as live distributed objects. The need for uniformity implies that the definition of a live distributed object must unify concepts such as live Web content, message streams, and instances of distributed multi-party protocols. The first implementation of the live distributed object concept, as defined in the ECOOP paper, was the Live Distributed Objects http://liveobjects.cs.cornell.edu platform developed by Krzysztof Ostrowski at Cornell University. The platform provided a set of visual, drag and drop tools for composing hierarchical documents resembling web pages, and containing XML-serialized live object references. Visual content such as chat windows, shared desktops, and various sorts of mashups could be composed by dragging and dropping components representing user interfaces and protocol instances onto a design form, and connecting them together. Since the moment of its creation, a number of extension have been developed to embed live distributed objects in Microsoft Office documents,Ahnn, J., Birman, K., Ostrowski, K., and van Renesse, R. (2008). \\"Using live distributed objects for office automation\\", Proceedings of the ACM/IFIP/USENIX Middleware '08 Conference Companion, Leuven, Belgium, December 01‚Äì05, 2008, Companion '08, ACM, New York, NY, 30-35, http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1462735.1462743. and to support various types of hosted content such as Google Maps.http://liveobjects.cs.cornell.edu/community/index.html As of March 2009, the platform is being actively developed by its creators.Ostrowski, K., and Birman, K.

She also had a predilection for programme music, as is evidenced by her four movement suite Woudsproke. Her works for amateur singers and choruses have been described as energetic. In them, Appeldoorn used simple tonal melodies and set the texts predominantly syllabically. In contrast, her accompaniments show a spicy harmonic language filled with dissonances which illustrate the text, such as in Frissche bloemen. Biography Dina Appeldoorn attended the Royal Conservatory of The Hague, where she studied composition under F.E.A. Koeberg and later with Johan Wagenaar. The later would become a close friend whom she would continue to consult throughout her life. She graduated the conservatory in 1910, at which time twenty of her songs had already been published. Her early work met with mixed reviews from Dutch music critics with some pieces, like Frissche bloemen, getting better reviews than others. Appeldoorn would later become a piano teacher at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague. After her studies, Appeldoorn began her career as a piano accompanist for various choirs in The Hague. Ultimately, though, she found herself drawn more toward her composition background. Many of her early songs were first performed by a quintet she founded with the soprano Lena van Diggelen. Other singers who have performed her work include Julie de Stuers, who gave several recitals outside of the Netherlands featuring Dutch composers. Appeldoorn dedicated her Vondel- liederen to Stuers. The Utrecht City Orchestra debuted her first major work, the symphonic poem P√™cheurs d‚ÄôIslande, in 1912. In 1923, one of her compositions was awarded a prize by the Nederlandsche Volkszang-bond in Utrecht. This was Jubileum-lied, which she wrote for Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands‚Äô 25th anniversary. In 1925, the Utrecht City Orchestra premiered another one of her works, her Noordzee-symfonie. Throughout the 1920s, Appeldoorn also wrote choral works for the popular community singing evenings in The Hague of the Nederlandse Vereniging voor den Volkszang, conducted by Arnold Spoel. Some of her choral works were also performed by Die Haghe Sanghers in the 1930s, such as Het Zwervers‚Äô Lied. In 1934, she found a fan in Eduard Flipse, who was then conductor of the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra. He promoted her work in the music community and his orchestra performed her work the Blijspel-ouverture. Appeldoorn also became involved with the Esperanto movement in the 1930s and wrote a large number of songs in the constructed language. She was also known for writing patriotic works, such as the Hollansche Overture and Loflied aan Nederland.

History \\"Miss Sophia's Diary\\" was written in 1927 and first published in the influential Early Republic of China \\"Fiction Monthly\\" (Â∞èËØ¥ÊúàÊä•). Ding Ling named the main character after Sofia Perovskaya, a Russian revolutionary who was executed for orchestrating the assassination of the tsar Alexandr II. A major influence on the story was Ding Ling's personal experiences at that time, including depression, exhaustion, and impoverishment. Dr. Tani E. Barlow describes Ding Ling in 1927 as \\"miserable, drinking heavily, dispirited by the national tragedy of political counterrevolution, and exhausted by her impoverished, often squalid life in boarding-house rooms . . . . \\" More generally, Ding Ling was passing from the milieu of a girls' schools to the male-dominated literary scene and involvement with some of China's most sophisticated male writers. Major themes The major subject matter of Miss Sophia's Diary is a person's thoughts and feelings. The \\"interior\\" nature of the story is reinforced by its setting in a tuberculosis sanatorium. Much of the diary concerns Miss Sophia's romantic attraction and sexual desire, and even reveals her bisexuality. More generally, the diary displays rapid swings of mood and outlook, and captures complex ambivalence of the subject about virtually everything in her life, what one scholar called \\"the chaos of personality.\\" Miss Sophia's Diary provides an unorthodox perspective on basic aspects of life. It expresses frank, unflattering views of the male gender: \\"glib, phony, cautious\\" . . . \\"make my skin crawl\\" . . . \\"bastard\\". It also shows an unflattering side of women: cruel, tough, selfish (\\"the lovely news that someone got sick over me\\") . . . \\"savage\\" It turns traditional morality on its head: the chasteness of her friends Yunglin and Yufang is \\"just one of those strange, unexplained things in life.\\" The story shows a person in all her complexity and contradictions. For instance, it shows how Miss Sophia is simultaneously able to exercise power over others, and yet is powerless. A recurring motif is that she has the power to command the attention of others, but not to make them understand her. She is attracted to a man named Ling Jishi for his physical beauty, but is stimulated by the jealousy of her friend Weidi. Moreover, Ling Jishi has \\"the beautiful form I adore\\" but a \\"cheap, ordinary soul.\\" Furthermore, Miss Sophia has varying degrees of awareness of her own complexity and contradictions. The author even speaks to her \\"readers\\" and admits that the diary is just one (crafted) version of her experience, and just another exercise in controlling the attention of others. The emotional complexity of the character can be sensed from the fact that, in the closing sentences of the story, her mood ranges from \\"profound anguish . . . a mere trifle . . . agony . . . excitement . . . laugh wildly, I feel so sorry for myself . . . pathetic . . .\\" Ding Ling uses this story to criticize Chinese society for not accommodating an independent woman like Sophia.Kuhlman, p. 362. Historical significance Miss Sophia's Diary is a landmark in the evolving role of women in China during the era marked by the New Culture Movement and May Fourth Movement.See full discussion in the editor's introduction to I Myself Am A Woman: Selected Writings of Ding Ling, Tani E. Barlow, ed. (Boston: Beacon Press, 1989). A subtext of Miss Sophia's Diary, left unspoken until late in the story, is that there is an irreconcilable contradiction between the instinct to be attracted to someone like Ling Jishi and the fact that he is so irredeemably unenlightened. Of equal historical significance is the interior nature of the narrative in Miss Sophia's Diary. In contrast to other first person narratives, even those using the \\"diary\\" format, such as the landmark A Madman's Diary by Lu Xun, Miss Sophia's Diary is unusual in the frankness with which it reveals a real person's emotions. Comparative perspective Madame Bovary by Gustave Flaubert was a major influence on Ding Ling in writing \\"Miss Sophia's Diary\\". English translations *Tani E.

The C√∫c Ph∆∞∆°ng National Park administration not only manages a refuge for rare animals. The Department of Culture has also issued a certificate, that declares Con Moong prehistoric site and its surroundings as National Relics. Among these locations, the archaeological site of Con Moong cave is of central importance for the study of the Mesolithic Hoabinhian culture. In April and May 1976 Vietnamese archaeologists have excavated the site.UNESCO Site Description Con Moong Cave Site description The Con Moong limestone cavity lies about above a valley level on the right bank of the Red River, running along the Da River, about south-west of Hanoi. The cave has two entrances that connect with one another. Excavations were made near the south- western entrance in an area of around and to a depth of . Ten strata, including the cave floor and the top crust (prefeudal to modern) were found and recorded in the cultural sediments. The Con Moong Cave may be one of the archaeological sites with the thickest cultural layers in Vietnam. Based on the structure of soil layers and typical items, the soil layers can be classified into three different cultural layers: # Down from the surface, layers 2, 3, and 4 belong to cultural layer III, which is the most recent. In this layer they found out some cobble tools, such as a H√≤a B√¨nh-style axe with blade, or B·∫Øc S∆°n-style and pottery. This is typical for H√≤a B√¨nh or B·∫Øc S∆°n culture. # Layers 6 and 7 belong to cultural layer II. Most of the tools found here present the typical features of H√≤a B√¨nh culture. The stone tools such as cutting tool with almond form, oval form, rectangular form; scraper of plate form, short axe, bone sharpen head tool, scraper of mother of pearl. The huddled tomb with yellow soil found here is also popular in H√≤a B√¨nh excavation sites. # Layer 9 is cultural layer I, the earliest. The typical stone tools with usable edges were covering one quarter of the cobble; there were also some fragments of broken wine bottles. These tools are typical for S∆°n Vi culture, proving that H√≤a B√¨nh culture comes from S∆°n Vi culture. Layers 5 and 8 are thin, with thickness from 10 to 25 cm, having burnt spots and inorganic material. They are the boundary line dividing the 3 cultural layers. In all cultural layers, traces of cooking can be seen, the later ones being nearer to the cave entrance. Together with the kitchen areas are the shells of mollusc, such as Cyclophorus, Camraena, Hybocystis, Antirnelania, Lanceolaria sp. nohyriopsls, Ozynaia, and Meretrix. Some of these molluscs are in situ, others smashed, closely mixed with each other or scattered in the soil. History Due to its long history of uninterrupted occupation, the Con Moong site is of great significance for the understanding of Vietnamese and South East Asian prehistory. Techniques to make cobble tools were continuously applied at the site during the S∆°n Vi culture the H√≤a B√¨nh culture and the B·∫Øc S∆°n culture. A continuous sequence of human cultural evolution with a distinct regionl character, from the end of the old stone age, through the middle stone age, to the new stone age, from hunter-gatherer culture to agriculture has occurred at the site. The development from the Old Stone Age to the New Stone Age in Vietnam also implies a change from the Pleistocene to the Holocene. Cultural layers I and II have various floristic compositions, which means that there is only sporoplasm (Polypodiaceae, Cyatheaceae) but not pollen; and vice versa, there is only pollen (Chenopodiaceae, Leguminosae, Rubiaceae, Myricaceae, Mzliaceae, Fagaceac) but not sporoplasm in cultural layer II. At present there are 17 generations C14 for cultural layers in different depths of the Con Moong excavation site. The duration between Pleistocene and Holocene of the Quaternary period in Vietnam that is more or less 10,000 years ago. In the Con Moong archaeological site, the existence of S∆°n Vi culture at the end of the Old Stone Age has been reconfirmed by stratum document. Moreover, formerly S∆°n Vi culture has been only known as existing before H√≤a B√¨nh culture but now it is known more clearly that it had been integrated with H√≤a B√¨nh culture at the utmost. Through the tombs found in cultural layers II and I, we have found out about the S∆°n Vi ancient people. The mollusks, yellow soil, and stone wares buried together with the dead people suggest that there is a connection between S∆°n Vi and H√≤a B√¨nh people based on the burial forms. The stone wares in layer II are of the H√≤a B√¨nh culture, but are big not small, and quite different from the European mesolithic. It means that in the mesolithic or epipaleolithic, people here did not use the bow and arrow as others, but rather the abundance of bamboo allowed them to use bows and cross- bows without armature, as in many other places. Layer III is of the B·∫Øc S∆°n culture, similar to H√≤a B√¨nh II that had been put forward before by M. Colani. H√≤a B√¨nh II or B·∫Øc S∆°n culture really belongs to the New Stone Age, with the appearance of axes with ground blades and pottery. With blade axes, the human beings had gained great achievement in production techniques of stone wares, the beginning for the New Stone Age revolution in Vietnam and the region. World Heritage status This site was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List on 21 June 2006, in the Cultural category.

Postwar  Although the published closure date known for this airfield relates to the World War II airfield, the Army maintained an Anti Aircraft training camp across from RAF Weybourne using Bofors 40 mm guns linked to AA4 mk7 gun-laying radar. When that closed in 1958 the radars were transferred to the RAF. A very small permanent detachment was maintained there using the obsolete radar into the 1980s for cross-tell training, decoy work and to extend low level coverage. In the late 1980s trials were carried out to confirm the site's suitability for deployment of the new mobile radars that were coming into service.

According to American historian Ephraim Emerton, who produced the first systematic study of the Order, \\"the fame of the house drew visitors, both well and sick, including women in childbirth and infants\\" from around Italy.Ephraim Emerton (1923), \\"Altopascio--A Forgotten Order,\\" American Historical Review, 29(1), 6. HistoryFoundation= The Order was founded by Matilda of Canossa between 1070 and 1080 at Altopascio, a town on the Via Francigena in what is now Tuscany.Michael Walsh (2003), Warriors of the Lord: The Military Orders of Christendom (Grand Rapids: William B. Eerdmans Publishing, .), 197. The earliest datable reference to a hospital edificatus in locus et finibus ubi dicitur Teupascio (\\"built in the place called Teupascio\\") is from 1084.A location called Teupascio is first mentioned in a document reporting a land transfer in Teutpascu, qui vocatur Tersuarius (\\"in Teupascio, which is called Tersuarius\\") from the nobleman Causulus of Lucca to the presbyter Tanuald of Saint Regulus \\"in the third year of the Lombard king Ratchis\\", that is, 746. Ludovico Muratori thought Teupascio to be an eighth-century corruption of the Latin Altopassus.Emerton, 4, citing Muratori (1739), Antiquitates Italicae Medii Aevi, IIL, 1041. Giovanni Lami believed it to be of Etruscan origin, but related it to the Latin totus pascuus (all pasture), denoting its verdant meadows, fed by a river of the same name which Lami believed to read in a grant of 1056. The variants Taupascio and Topascio have led some to suppose a relationship between the (alternative) name of the town and the Order sometimes known as \\"of the Tau\\", after their symbol, which would once have been a common sight in the town. This derivation is highly unlikely, however, and the name appears to be Germanic in origin.Emerton, 4-5, believes it meant \\"German pasture\\" or \\"German pass\\". He adduces evidence in support of this from the Germanic names prevalent in charters referring to Teupascio. The document of 746 is witnessed by Ratpert, Tuirepert, Eliprandus, and a scribe named Aldipertus. The 1056 document is a title deed relating to one Teutio and referring to a priest Theupert. Also, near where the rivers Arno and Elsa meet, sits the town and castle named San Miniato al Tedesco, that is, \\"to the German\\". According to the Order's own tradition it was founded between the Palude di Fucecchio, the Lago di Sesto, and the forest of Cerbaie towards 1050 by twelve citizens of nearby Lucca, a tradition which is preserved in a couple of lines of poetry appended to the Italian version of its rule: {  :La qual casa sia questa dell' Ospitale :La quale incommincio lo Coro duodenale.Emerton, 5. These were persone da bene (persons of means) according to Lami.  :That house which belongs to the hospital :Which was founded by the Choir of twelve. } Probably the \\"choir of twelve\\" refers to the founding twelve members (brethren, friars, fratres), not to twelve founders.Its foundation is probably wrapped up in the spiritual movements of the mid-eleventh century, such as the Pataria, the Peace and Truce of God, and the Gregorian reform. The movement is attested in the area by the foundation in 1039 and spiritualisation in 1059 of the Badia di San Pietro in nearby Badia Pozzeveri. In his Memorie di Pescia, Francesco Galeotti wrote that the Order was founded by a rich and pious personaggio (individual). The Order was dedicated to James the Greater and Egidius. Its head was initially a rector, later a grand master (magister generalis), custos (custodian), warden, and eventually even bore the title Signore d'Altopascio (Lord of Altopascio).Emerton, 6. Originally the Order was composed of a few canons charged with caring for pilgrims on their way to Rome or the Holy Land, via Italy, but later it extended its concern to the Way of Saint James. Their headquarters were in the church of the same name, San Giacomo dell' Alto Passo. Their Great Hospital dedicated to Saint James at Altopascio (Domus Hospitalis Sancti Iacobi de AltopassuTranslation: House of the Hospital of Saint James of Altopascio, .) is first mentioned in a bull of Innocent III from 1198, though he refers to earlier grants to the hospice by the Bishops of Lucca, whose names indicate that it existed as early as the third quarter of the century.Emerton, 5. In 1244 the hospice of Altopassus received a confirmation of its properties in Italy from the Emperor Frederick II as part of a program of support for institutions looking after the miserabiles (unfortunate). The emperor forbade the imposition of any tax on the Order or any interference lay or ecclesiastical with its property.Emerton, 7, says: \\"all persons are forbidden to obstruct in any way the free passage of goods destined for the service of the hospice or to hinder the brethren in their coming and going about their business--pro quacumque necessitate vel negotio suo--anywhere in Italy by the imposition of any form of exaction.\\" The movement of goods as part of the Order's regular business was to go unhindered.Emerton, 7. =Expansion= In time the Order came to be charged with safeguarding the roads and the bridges from brigands. The Order also had a bell named \\"La Smarrita\\" that was rung each night from a half hour before sunset to a half hour past to help guide any pilgrim wandering in the woods to safety. This custom was still reported in the time of Lami. They maintained a ferry service on the Arno River: > in the territory of Florence and on the high road to Rome, where formerly a > heavy tribute was exacted. This road has now been made free by members of > the aforesaid Great Hospital and of other hospitals affiliated with it. So > that at present all pilgrims and others freely pass there without > payment.Emerton, 2, quoting Pierre H√©lyot, in his turn quoting Jacques du > Breul, Le Th√©√¢tre des Antiquitez de Paris (Paris: Pierre Chevalier, 1612), > 576. The church of Saint-Jacques-du-Hault-Pas, the first Altopascian foundation in Paris. The lands from which the Order drew its income were found throughout Tuscany: in the Valdarno (bull of Anastasius IV of 1154), Valdinievole (bull of Alexander III of 1169), and Pistoia and Prato (aforementioned bull of Innocent III of 1198). Eventually the Order spread throughout Tuscany and Italy, reaching first Naples, Sardinia, and Sicily. The Order was eventually internationalised and had reached as far as the Rh√¥ne in Provence by the end of the twelfth century. It received endowments in Bavaria, Burgundy, the Dauphin√©, England, Flanders, France, Germany, Lorraine, Navarre, Portugal, and Savoy. Each separate body was called a mansio (plural mansiones) on analogy with the Roman relay stations and hospitals abiding by the Order's rule were called obedientiae. Grants to the mansiones of money and land and, in the later Middle Ages, tithes were supervised by the grand master. The heart of the Order was always in Tuscany, however, as its close relationship with the great families of the Republic of Florence shows.Emerton, 6, citing Lami's documents. There is evidence that in the sixteenth century the Order was exchanging lands in such a way as to build up a compact territory of holdings nearer Altopascio.In 1481 the grand master, a member of the Capponi family of Florence, exchanged lands in Florence itself for lands near Fucecchio contiguous with properties already held by the order, with the permission of the papal legate. (The document is affirmed by \\"Antonio, son of Anastasio, son of Amerigo de' Vespucci, notary\\" and a brother of another Amerigo Vespucci.) The same grand master also exchanged lands in Volterra and Pisa with \\"Giovanni, notary of the Apostolic See, canon of Florence, and son of Lorenzo the Magnificent\\" for lands nearer Florence. The church and hospital of Saint- Jacques-du-Haut-Pas in Paris, subject to the Great Hospital, was founded by Philip IV of France.Emerton, 2. Other sources place its foundation in 1180. It was still active in 1567. =Suppression= The Order was suppressed by the bull Execrabilis issued by Pius II on 18 January 1459 along with five other religiones (religious orders). Their property was transferred to the fledgling Order of Our Lady of Bethlehem founded by that same bull: > Further, we suppress and annul their former ordinances (ordines), the names > of their associations, their titles of priority (priorales) and other > dignities, and we decree that henceforth they shall be called, held, and > named as of that military order of Saint Mary of Bethlehem. Moreover, in > this order there shall be brethren and knights and priests as also in the > aforesaid Order of Rhodes [Knights of Saint John], and the head of the > aforesaid Hospital of Saint Mary of Bethlehem shall be the Master, elected > by the brethren in the same way (pariformiter) [as in the Order of > Rhodes].Emerton, 22-23. The suppression, however, was imperfectly carried out, or perhaps was never carried out at all.C. H. M. (1924), \\"The Fratres Pontifices and the Community at Altopasio,\\" Catholic Historical Review, 9:4, 565-66. The Order certainly retained some Italian property until, on 14 March 1587, Sixtus V, at the request of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, merged the Order of Altopascio with the Order of Saint Stephen. In France it was finally absorbed into the Order of Saint Lazarus in 1672. OrganisationRule= The Order's rule, the Regola dei Frati di San Jacopo d'Altopascio, was promulgated in ninety-six chapters by Gregory IX in 1239, and was based on the rule of the Knights of Saint John and, more generally, the rule of Saint Augustine.Emerton, 9. The rule was requested by the brethren. It is unknown if they abided by a different rule before 1239.If they were always Augustinians, as Walsh, 197, believes, they probably requested the more specific Hospitaller rule to more efficiently organise their Order, cf. Emerton, 9. The new rule also instituted a previously unknown hierarchy of members, leading the brethren to eventually refer to themselves all as knights, cf. Emerton, 18. The Latin rule is preserved in the Archives nationales on twenty-one 8¬Ω\\"x6\\" pages.Emerton, 12, who reviewed only photographic reproductions of the Latin manuscript, notes that the paragraphs \\"correspond in general with those in the Italian version\\". It was first published (in part) by the antiquarian Giovanni Lami between 1741 and 1754 and edited (entirely) by Pietro Farfani in 1864 in Italian.Emerton, 1-4\\\\. He disparages Farfani's Italian edition (in Curiosit√† Letterarie, LIV) on page 11, though Fanfani was aware that his Italian version was not contemporary but was a later translation, since the original Latin had been quoted at an earlier date by the Sieur du Cange. A Pescian document of 1358 still referred to the order as \\"living under the Rule of Saint Augustine\\".Emerton, 11. By a comparison with the Hospitaller rule it is clear that the first twenty-five chapters of the Altopascian rule correspond to the first nineteen chapters from the Hospitaller rule of Raymond du Puy (from 1125-53).Emerton, 13. Chapters 30-37, which deal with the proper burial of deceased brethren, are probably adapted from the additions made by Jobert of Syria to the Hospitaller rule between 1177 and 1181. Chapters 39-45 are concerned with the care for the sick and were added to the Hospitaller rule by Roger de Moulins in 1181 or 1182. Chapters 47-52 and 76 are derived from the later usances (customs) of the order of Saint John, with chapters 49-52 prescribing the ceremonies for the initiation of brethren and confrati (affiliated persons). Chapters 53-75 are a selection of later Hospitaller esgards (judgements), probably chosen for their relevance to the Altopascian situation. They deal primarily with crime. Chapters 26-29, 38, 46, and 77-96 are not based on the Hospitaller rule. =Composition= The Order's members appear to have been mostly laymen. References in the Order's rule to fees paid to priests for their services imply that these priests were not members, since the Order's rule elsewhere prohibits private property.Emerton, 13-14. In 1324 Marsilius of Padua, in his Defensor pacis, criticised the Papacy for trying to classify as many persons as possible as clerici (clergy), and appears to say that the Order of Altopascio was lay, but the Pope wished to classify it as clerical.This depends on alto passu in the following quotation meaning Altopascio: Sic quoque fratres templariorum, hospitaliorum et reliquos plures hujusmodi ordines, similiter et eos qui de alto passu (Emerton, 1). Chapter 64 of the Order's rule, however, does refer to brothers who are \\"priest or deacon or of any other clerical order\\".Emerton, 14, concludes that the priests associated with the order performed regular functions, but when outside priests were unavailable for special services, house priests could be paid the honorarium and perform the services. If the trend reported by Marsiglio continued, the ratio of clerical to lay brethren may have increased in the late Middle Ages. Pierre H√©lyot, having seen certain tomb effigies of some brethren bearing the insignia of ordination, calls the Order the Chanoines Hospitaliers de S. Jacques du Haut-Pas ou de Lucques (canons hospitaller of Saint James of Altopascio or of Lucca).Emerton, 2, 14-15, quoting H√©lyot (1792), Histoire des Ordres Religieux et Militaires, 2nd ed., II, 282. H√©lyot implies that the brethren were not canons regular. The knights (cavalieri) of the Order were established by chapter 93 of its Rule, which is an almost verbatim copy of a paragraph of a set of Hospitaller regulations drawn up at Margat in 1204-06.Emerton, 16. The Hospitaller regulations survive in parallel Latin and Old French texts. The knights are only mentioned once else in the Rule, in chapter 78, where the process of electing a grand master is described. The prior of the Order is to select from the brethren a priest (frate preite), a knight, and a servitor (also sergent, servente), who will form the electorate and choose a master.This provision is derived from the Margat rule, and is the only paragraph of that text to survive in French but not Latin, cf. Emerton, 16. Emerton casts doubt on the military nature of these knights, suggesting instead that they were lay noble religious. He points out that the Rule omits all of the Hospitallers' references to horses, arms, and armour. Besides the priest and knight there is another special position in the order, singled out for its involvement in the election of the master: the servitor, who was subordinate to the regular brother. The servitors were not allowed to fighting among themselves, to refuse work, or to spend the night in town without permission. Strict penalties were prescribed, but their pay was never withheld and they appear to have been hired workers.Emerton, 17. They were under the direction of the brethren, but performed the majority of menial tasks. =Symbols= seal of the Order, showing its \\"tau\\" symbol. Di nero alla Tau d'argento, con il braccio verticale aguzzato e affiancata da due conchiglie di San Giacomo dello stesso (\\"Black, with a silver tau, with a sharpened vertical arm and flanked by two conchs of Saint James, the same\\"). The symbol of the order was the letter tau, usually white on a black field, the vertical arm of the tau being always pointed at the bottom and the crossbar either square at the ends or else concave or notched like a Maltese cross, the result being called a croce taumata. These peculiarities have suggested to some historians that it represents an auger and an axe or hammer and thus carpentry, probably to be associated with bridge-building and road maintenance.Lami, in his Novelle Letterarie di Firenze (1747), first makes this identification, based on a representation of the Order's symbol that he saw \\"on the campanile of the conventual church of the Knights (Cavalieri) at Altopascio\\". He adds that he \\"had the famous Cristofano Martini make a drawing from the original and engrave it on copper\\". Lami's final description of the symbol as he observed it in the campanile (which he dated to 1056) goes: \\"the true symbol (vera segna) of the brethren of that hospice, that is, as it were a Tau with a pointed upright shaft and two transverse arms like the two arms of a Maltese cross\\", quoted in Emerton, 8. The aforementioned edict of Frederick II contains one obligation placed on the order: > It is our will and command that the hospice and its brethren build and > maintain upon the public pilgrim's highway near Ficeclum on the White Arno, > at the most convenient point, a bridge for the service of travellers, and > this without let or hindrance from any person whomsoever. But if, in case of > flood or other accident, they shall be without a bridge, it is our will that > they provide a ferry-boat for the free transportation of pilgrims, and it > shall be unlawful for any other person to keep any boat there for > passengers, whether for hire or not.Quoted in Emerton, 7. The Order's rule, however, does not mention the maintenance of bridges or roads. A similar tau-like symbol or cross was venerated at the same time by the Franciscans. It may have symbolised perfection, since taf was the last letter of the Hebrew alphabet.The letter tau symbolised thaumaturgy at Santiago de Compostela. Activities The care of the sick was the primary mission of the Order. The Rule required four physicians and two surgeons attached to the hospital.Emerton, 15, notes that they had to be acquainted with uroscopy, medical diagnosis, and pharmacology, the production of syrups and other drugs. The Rule exhibits \\"an enlightened conception of the needs of the sick that would do credit to any modern institution\\".Emerton, 15. It laid down the principle of primum non nocere and even advised a \\"hearty diet\\" during Lent for the ill.Eels, cheese, peas, beans, and cabbage were forbidden as unwholesome. For \\"our lords (domini, signori) the sick\\", as the Order's patients are called in the Rule, beds must be large with separate sheets and coverlets, each patient was to have fur cloak and woolen cap for use in the commons area (per andare ad luogo commune). Cribs and cradles were to be provided for newborns. The Order was not an order of fratres pontifices (\\"pontifical, i.e. bridge-building, brethren\\") and was not heavily involved in bridge-building.Emerton, 19. H√©lyot, in examining the origins of certain bridges associated with hospitallers in the Rh√¥ne valley, ascribed their construction to the Order of Altopascio, whose members he calls religieux hospitaliers pontifes (\\"bridge-building hospitaller religious\\"). H√©lyot went so far as to associated the famous Saint B√©n√©zet with the Altopascians. Henri Gr√©goire, writing in 1818, cast doubt on the thesis and Emerton rejected it as groundless while admitting that the Proven√ßal hospitals may well have been associated with Altopascia.Emerton, 20-21\\\\. See also Marjorie Nice Boyer (1964), \\"The Bridgebuilding Brotherhoods,\\" Speculum, 39:4, 637. Besides the bridge at Fucechhio which is known from the imperial edict of 1244 to have been charged to the Order's care, other bridges may have been maintained in Italy where the Via Francigena crosses the Arda, the Elsa, the Taro, and the Usciana. Primary textsText of the Papal bull of 1239= Ephraim Emerton provides an English translation of the Papal bull granting the Order a rule:His translation (pp 9-10) is based on Joseph Delaville le Roulx (1894), Cartulaire g√©n√©rale de l'ordre des Hospitaliers, II, 566. :Gregory, Bishop, Servant of the Servants of God, to the Master and Brethren of the Hospital of Altopascio in the Diocese of Lucca, Greeting and Apostolic Benediction! :It is the practice of the apostolic see to respond favorably to pious requests and to grant its kindly favor to the sincere prayers of its petitioners. Wherefore, beloved sons in the Lord, we have inclined our ear to your petition and have decided to grant to you and to your successors by these presents the Rule of the Brethren of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem, to be observed forever in the Hospital of Altopassus and in all its dependent houses, the privileges previously granted by the apostolic see to your hospital to remain in full force. :We do not intend, however, that through this grant the Master and Brethren of the Hospital of Jerusalem shall acquire any rights or jurisdiction whatsoever over your hospital or its [subsidiary] houses. Let no one, therefore, encroach upon this our grant or act in rash opposition to it. If any one shall presume to attempt this, let him know that he will incur the wrath of Almighty God and his blessed Apostles, Peter and Paul. ::Given at the Lateran on the 5th day of April in the 13th year of our pontificate. =Selection of chapters from the Rule, 1239= Emerton provides an English translation of chapter 20 of the Altopascian rule, concerning punishment for the holding of private property:Emerton, 14. :If any brother at the time of his death shall have any property which he has concealed from the Master, he shall be buried without divine service as a person excommunicate. And if during his life concealed money shall be found upon him, it shall be hanged about his neck and he shall be stripped and soundly flogged through the Hospital of Saint James at Altopascio or any other house where he may belong, by a clergyman, if he be a clergyman, and by a layman, if he be a layman. And let him do penance for forty days and fast the fourth and sixth days of the week on bread and water. He also provides a translation those chapters (30-37) concerning the death and burial of members: :Where the body of a brother of the Hospital shall be buried, there let his name be written in the calendar, and after thirty days let there be an anniversary day for him forever. If in the church where the trecennario [memorial service of thirty days] is celebrated there are three priests, let one celebrate the trecennario and the two others sing the masses for the day. If there are two priests, the service of the trecennario is to be divided between them, and the fees also. In a church where there is only one priest another is to be called in from outside to perform the trecennario, and when this is completed he is to receive as a gratuity (caritatevilemente [sic]), one bezant and a shirt and a new pair of breeches, according to the custom of the House. But, if no [outside] priest can be found, the priest of the House alone may perform the trecennario, celebrating mass daily for the dead, excepting on Sundays and holy days, and then let a special commemoration for the dead brother be made; but, after thirty days, let the number of thirty days on which only special masses are said for the dead brother be completed, and then let the priest have the aforesaid gratuity. He also provides a translation of chapter 45, about the care of the sick:Emerton, 18. :Finally, besides the daily care and watchfulness which the brethren of the Hospital are bound to exercise with zeal and devotion toward the needy poor, as toward their masters, it is added in Chapter General that in each corridor (rutga), i.e., ward (piazza) of the house of the Hospital, where the patients lie, nine servitors shall be placed at their service, who, under the orders of the brethren, shall bathe the heads and feet of the sick and dry them with towels. They shall keep them tidy (forbano), shall make their beds, bring them their meals, and supply them carefully with drink, and, in general, whatever is needful and useful for the sick they shall obediently do. He also provides a translation of chapter 64, based on Hospitaller esgard 10, which concerns crimes by members: :If any brother, being priest or deacon or of any other clerical order, shall commit any offense, and this shall come to the knowledge of the Prior or the Master, the brethren whom the Prior shall select for the court shall judge with righteous judgment and shall impose a penance of seven days or even of forty according to the gravity of the fault, just as in the case of other brethren who are not in holy orders. For, seeing that we are all of one religion and all, both clergy and laymen, make the same profession, it seems unfitting that there should be any distinction between brethren within the Hospital. Wherefore it is ordered that, as we live under one rule, so also we ought to be subject to the same judges of the rule. He also provides a translation of chapters 67-70 and 72 on the relationship between friars (fratres) and servitors:Emerton, 16-17. :If a friar shall strike a servitor, and this shall come to the knowledge of the Prior of the House, let him do penance for seven days. If blood flows, except from the nose, let him do penance for forty days; but, if the servitor dies from the wound, the friar shall lose his habit and shall be sent to Rome to our lord the pope for his penance. After that, if he receive letters from the pope and ask for mercy, he may be received back, saving the justice of the house, and shall do penance for forty days. :If a servitor assaults a friar, and the friar reports it to the Prior, let the servitor do penance. But, if he shall call the friar a thief or a fornicator or a malefactor under the house rules (della casa), and cannot prove the charge, let him be severely flogged by the friars, first through the house, then to the door, and out of the house; nevertheless, let him be paid what is owing to him. :In the case of a servitor who quits without permission and then returns to make amends, if his service is paid at the discretion of the Hospital (ad caritate), first let him do penance and, for the time since the beginning of the year, let nothing be reckoned to him. But if he is serving on contract (ad convenzione), after he has done his penance, let the time of his actual service be reckoned to him, and at the end of the year, let him be paid his price, that is, what is due him. :If a servitor steals property of the Hospital, even a whole loaf of bread, or shall sell the same, and it be clearly proven, let the stolen property be hanged about his neck, and let him be soundly flogged through the house to the door, and at the door let him be given a loaf of bread and be discharged, and let him have what he has earned-- but, this at the discretion of the Prior and the friars. :Servitors may not testify against a friar except on a charge involving penance of seven days. If they have the presumption to attempt this on a charge of forty days' penance, they shall not be heard. If they try to testify to a crime for which a friar would lose his habit, they shall not be believed--unless he be caught in the act--which God forbid! He also provides a translation of chapter 93, the only one concerned with knighthoods: :Let no one demand to be made a knight while he is in the Hospital, unless this had been promised him before he took the habit of a religious, and then only if he has reached the age at which he might have become a knight if he had remained in the world. Nevertheless the sons of noblemen, especially if they have been brought up in the Hospital, when they have reached military age, may, with the consent of the Master and[/or] of the Prior (coinandeor, comandatore), and with the approval of the brethren of the House, be invested with the insignia of knighthood. =An incident at Pescia in 1358= Emerton also provides an English translation of Giovanni Lami's retelling of an incident involving the Order and the city of Pescia in 1358:Derived from Lami, Deliciae eruditorum, XVI. :At that time the Grand Master was Messer Jacopo da Pescia. He accepted as brethren of the Order many citizens of Pescia who were married men and who took the habit to escape the payment of taxes and avoid doing guard duty, to the very great detriment of the community. When the commune perceived that the greed (ingordigia) of these friars was over great it deputed a magistrate to see that the commune was protected and to take such action as was best for the service of God and of the public. This magistrate, having heard and well considered what these friars had been doing, gave orders that they should be driven out of Pescia and its territory and should not be allowed to enter it. He made proclamation that whoever had any claim against the Master and his friars should bring it before the chancellor of the community, and that no person should work the properties of the friars or cause them to be worked, under heavy penalties. He sent messengers to the [papal] legate, to the Signoria of Florence and to Messer Andrea da Todi, the papal collector, to notify them of his action. The result of this policy of the commune was that the Master and the friars refrained from taking married men as brethren, but when an occasion arose for receiving such the Master wrote to the commune commending himself, the friars, and the hospitals to the protection of the same. This letter was read in the Grand Council and referred by it to the above-mentioned magistrate for the necessary action. After due consideration of the whole matter he decided that certain married men of Pescia were not and could not be brethren of that Order, but were subject to the jurisdiction of the commune of Pescia. Messer Andrea da Todi, the papal collector, also gave orders that the Master should not in future receive any married person, and that those friars who were married should have no vote in the chapter.

His first appearance was in Kitty Pryde and Wolverine #2 (Dec 1984), and was scripted by Chris Claremont and drawn by Allen Milgrom. Fictional character biography Ogun was a ninja and martial arts master who acted as Wolverine's mentor. Very little is known of his past or the exact nature of his abilities, but he was apparently a mutant who could possess and control minds via telepathy. His reflexes and reaction time also appear to have been enhanced beyond the range attainable by normal humans, such as that he was easily a match for Wolverine. Note that either or both of these abilities may have been wholly or partially mystical in nature.Wolverine #50 Ogun first met Wolverine in Shanghai, China. Shanghai was held by the Empire of Japan, following the Battle of Shanghai in the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937‚Äì1945). Ogun was reportedly active in the War as a captain of the Imperial Japanese Army. Wolverine was only a wandering sailor but managed to draw the attention of the captain who would seek his acquaintance. The issue was scripted by Larry Hama and drawn by Leinil Francis Yu.Wolverine #113 (May 1997) At some point in the past, Ogun fell from the path of honor and was a criminal enforcer for the Yakuza. Ogun mentally possessed Kitty Pryde trained as a ninja, and attempted to turn her into an assassin. Under Wolverine's care, however, Kitty recovered and resisted another brainwashing attempt, and Wolverine was eventually forced to kill Ogun.Kitty Pryde and Wolverine #1-6 Years later, Ogun returned as a disembodied spirit, mentally possessing host after host, and again attacked Wolverine and Kitty. With Ghost Rider's help, Wolverine figured out that to destroy Ogun involved only destroy Ogun's enchanted mask (apparently he had several as the first was already destroyed). Ogun was thus destroyed, seemingly for good.Wolverine #89 Later, Ogun returned yet again, this time travelling from host body to host body, and he even tried to take over Lady Deathstrike's body. Wolverine found a way to force him out of all available host bodies and into the body of Viper who Wolverine impaled (non-lethally). Panicking, Ogun jumped from Viper's body but having no form to inhabit, seemed to evaporate away. But as seen somewhat later, Ogun even survived that and tried to take his revenge on Pryde and Wolverine by luring the two onboard of the Hellicarrier he was able to control through the things about cyberpathy he learned while taking over Lady Deathstrike, but once again he was defeated. It is not known what happened after Kitty managed to convince him of the error of his ways inside the astral plane.Kitty Pryde, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. #1-3 Ogun's clan is now shown to be run by Sojobo and Karasu, a pair of psychic twins he had adopted as a son and daughter prior to his demise. The children are rescued from this brutal existence by David Haller who shows them that they don't have to follow in their father's murderous footsteps.X-Men Legacy (vol. 2) #3 After a skirmish with the X-Men, the twins are then taken to the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning.X-Men Legacy (vol. 2) #4 Ogun's spirit later resurfaces and tries to possess Kitty once more before his host manages to drive him out. It's also revealed that Ogun had murdered Cyber in an attempt to sell the villain's adamantium-laced corpse to Abraham Cornelius.Death of Wolverine #3 Ogun's spirit possessed the fighter Shogun.Wolverines #1-20 Powers and abilities The extent and nature of Ogun's powers was never fully revealed. He demonstrated the ability to control minds and could remove his spirit from his body and place in a new host (submerging that host body's personality). His original body also seemed to be somewhat resistant to injury, although Wolverine managed to kill him. Ogun was able to survive impalement through the torso by a sword thrust with no apparent ill-effects. His reflexes and agility were heightened beyond normal human levels. It is implied that Ogun was a telepath who also had some mystical powers, but this was never clearly specified. In life, Ogun was also apparently capable of slowing or completely halting his aging; a legend is mentioned where he had once a duel of wills with the Japanese swordmaster Miyamoto Musashi.Kitty Pryde and Wolverine #4 In other mediaTelevision= Ogun makes his animated debut in the Wolverine and the X-Men animated series, voiced by James Sie. This version is depicted as Wolverine's sensei rather than an immortal ninja. In the episode \\"Code of Conduct\\", his memory is used by Professor X to help refresh Logan's samurai skills. =Toys= The Series 6 Wolverine figure from ToyBiz's Marvel Legends line came with a display base that featured Ogun.

He played 21 games at first, with a fielding percentage of .994 and one error, and 59 games in left field. In 2012 he batted .230/.308/.399 with 11 home runs and 36 RBIs in 296 at bats.

In 99 games in 2014, Morrison hit .262/.315/.420 while finishing with 11 home runs and 38 RBIs in 336 at bats. Over the final two months of the season (49 games), he hit .321/.375/.512 with 6 home runs and 20 RBIs, solidifying his role as the Mariners' first baseman heading into 2015.

J. Riefenhauser, and Boog Powell. Morrison would wear number 7 during his time with the Rays.

The company numbered sixty men and officers and saw action as part of the expeditionary force dispatched to put down the American Indian uprising during Tecumseh's War. The company saw additional service as part of a larger militia force that operated during the War of 1812. Formation In September 1811 John Gibson, secretary of the Indiana Territory, called out the militia in response to rising tensions with Native American tribes in the region. The Yellow Jackets were one such company to respond to the call. The company gained its name from the uniforms provided by the county for the men. The cuffs and fringes of their buckskins and wool coats were dyed a bright yellow.Funk p. 25 The militia of Harrison County was organized into a company of sixty men commanded by Captain Spier Spencer, the county sheriff. Spencer was a veteran of at least forty prior engagements with Native Americans. The second in command was 1st Lieutenant Richard McMahan, a new settler living near Corydon. The company had four sergeants and four corporals, one of each from each township in the county. Among them was Pearse Chamberlain, Henry Batman, and William Pennington, the younger brother of Dennis Pennington the speaker of the territorial legislature. Dennis Pennington was also a member of the company, but was unable to join the expedition because he was overseeing the construction of the new county courthouse and had to attend a meeting of the legislature who were called into an emergency session. The company had eight ensigns including future U.S. Senator John Tipton. Tipton kept a detailed journal of the company's activities and it is from that source that most knowledge of the company is known. The company contained two musicians, Daniel Cline serving as a drummer and Isham Stroud as a fifer. Both boys were fifteen years old, the youngest men in the company. There were forty-three privates enlisted, including many of the prominent men in the county.Funk, p. 26 The privates were paid between $8 and $6.66 for the duration of their four- month enlistment. The officers were paid between $50 and $26. All the men were required to supply their own horses and were paid forty cents a day for their horses' fodder. The company first met at Harrison Mill on the western edge of the county. After camping there a night waiting for the entire force to come together the company set out to join the primary camp of the territorial militia.Funk p. 27 Tippecanoe expedition On September 8 the company set out down the Buffalo Trace towards the capital in Vincennes. Traveling along the road they met up with other companies of infantry militia traveling by wagon who they accompanied the remainder of the journey. By the 16th they crossed the White River and met up with the main army commanded by Governor William Henry Harrison on the 18th. For the next twelve days the company remained in camp just north of Vincennes. On September 30 they received orders to march to Maria Creek with the rest of militia gathered in the camp to meet the army regulars already stationed near Maria Creek. Upon reaching their destination the Yellow Jackets were removed from the normal chain of command and moved to only answer to Harrison. Harrison intended to use the company as scouts and foragers. He put them in a wide formation around the main body of the army where they kept watch for enemies and gathered wild game to bring back to the main army. The company was successful and was even able to find beehives and bring back ten gallons of honey. On October 3 the army reached the site of modern Terre Haute, a strategic location on the Wabash River. The company continued to scout the countryside and forage while the rest of the army constructed Fort Harrison. A small detachment of mounted men under the command of Lieutenant Thomas Berry was added the Yellow Jackets.Funk, p. 28 On October 10 a small group of Indians ambushed sentries at the fort, wounding a man. The Yellow Jackets quickly drew up around the fort preparing to drive off an attack, but it never materialized. On October 22 the company held elections for additional officers, and Tipton was promoted to Lieutenant. The army soon resumed its advance, and by the end of the month they had arrived in modern Vermillion County. On November 2 Harrison ordered the entire army to parade so he could inspect them. The entire force did so, except the Yellow Jackets, who were off foraging. Harrison threatened to demote all of their officers, but never carried through on the threat for fear they would desert.Funk, p. 29 On November 3 the army moved out again and the Yellow Jackets along with the dragoons were put out in a skirmishing formation in front of the army to clear any possible enemies. By November 6, they reached the village of Prophetstown, the center of the native resistance. That night the army camped on a hill near the edge of the settlement. The army was camped in a battle formation and the Yellow Jackets were placed on the far right flank. Early on the morning of November 7, the Indians in Prophetstown launched a preemptive strike on the army.Funk, p. 30 The attack took the army by surprise and the brunt of the attack came down on the right flank. Captain Spencer was among the first to be killed, being shot in each thigh. Governor Harrison later recorded his death in a dispatch to Washington. Of Spencer he said, \\"...Spencer was wounded in the head. He exhorted his men to fight valiantly. He was shot through both thighs and fell; still continuing to encourage them, he was raised up, and received a ball through his body, which put an immediate end to his existence...\\" Lieutenants McMahan and Berry were also soon wounded and killed. As the Yellow Jackets were quickly overwhelmed a reserve company of regulars came to reinforce their line and turned the tide. The battle lasted three hours before the Native forces withdrew. The Yellow Jackets suffered the highest casualties of the army, over 30%. Eleven were killed in the battle or died from wounds and thirteen wounded.

The common technique of theorizing a normal distribution of price changes underestimates tail risk when market data exhibit fat tails. Tail risk is sometimes defined less strictly: as merely the risk (or probability) of rare events.

He studied philosophy and theology at the University of Leipzig, and from 1814 to 1819 served as a minister to a Saxon Landwehr installation. Afterwards he worked as a pastor in the hamlet of Hermannsdorf in the Erzgebirge. In 1838 he settled in Dresden, where he published his first book, Der Urevangelist oder exegetisch kritische Untersuchung √ºber das Verwandtschaftsverh√§ltni√ü der drei ersten Evangelien (The Urevangelist, exegetical critical study on the relationship of the first three Gospels, 1838). In this work he asserted that the evangelist Mark was the \\"original evangelist\\" and was the source for the Gospels of Matthew and Luke. During the same time frame, philosopher Christian Hermann Weisse (1801-1866), independent of Wilke, came up with the same conclusion. In the following years, Wilke published a New Testament lexicon called Clavis Novi Testamenti Philologica (1840‚Äì41, not to confuse with a anterior book of same title by Christian Abraham Wahl), a book involving New Testament rhetoric titled Die neutestamentliche Rhetorik (1842‚Äì43) and an influential study on New Testament hermeneutics called Die Hermeneutik des Neuen Testaments (1843‚Äì44).

He was Governor of Gibraltar from 1753 to 1756, and twice court-martialled during his service. The first followed defeat at Prestonpans in the 1745 Jacobite Rising, when he was acquitted. As Governor of Gibraltar, he was court-martialled again for his part in the 1756 Battle of Minorca, a defeat that led to the execution of Admiral Byng. Sentenced to nine months suspension, despite minimal responsibility for the defeat, George II insisted he be dismissed from the army. This ended his career, although he was reinstated as Lieutenant General following the accession of George III in 1761. He died in Bath in March 1765. Fowke's great-uncle emigrated to Virginia in 1651, and he was closely related to George Mason, 1725 to 1792, one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. Mason built a house he named Gunston Hall, after the family home in Gunstone, South Staffordshire; it is now an historic monument. Life Thomas Fowke was the elder son of Thomas Fowke (ca 1645‚Äì1708) and his second wife Mary (ca 1650‚Äì1705), born in 1690 near Gunstone, South Staffordshire. He had two sisters, Mary and Martha; his younger brother Edmund (1704‚Äì1784) became a Rear-admiral. He was married twice, first to Elizabeth Ingoldsby (ca 1705‚Äì1735), with whom he had a daughter, Theophila Lucy (1724‚Äì1734). In 1747, he married Dorothea Randall (ca 1732‚Äì1788); they had two children, another Theophila (ca 1745‚Äì1756), and Sir Thomas Fowke (1744‚Äì1786). His grandson was Sir Frederick Fowke (1782‚Äì1856). He died in Bath, England in March 1765. Career Sir John Cope arriving at Berwick after Prestonpans; a popular caricature of the time, the image has persisted Fowke began his military career during the War of the Spanish Succession in 1702 as an Ensign in Nicholas Lepell's Regiment of Foot, his father being a captain in the same unit. Until the late 19th century, commissions could be purchased or sold; in June 1707, he became captain after exchanging positions with his father, who died in June 1708. Peregrine Lascelles, who later served with Fowke in the 1745 Rising, was a captain in the same regiment. In 1710, the unit served in Spain, a last effort to win the Spanish throne for Archduke Charles of Austria. Despite victories at Almanara and Saragossa, the Allies were defeated at Villaviciosa in December. The regiment suffered heavy losses; Lepell, by then the senior British officer in Catalonia, reported losses of 107 men after the battle. Villaviciosa ended the campaign in Spain, and Lepells was disbanded in November 1712 as the army was reduced prior to the 1713 Peace of Utrecht. Fowke managed to retain his commission, transferring into Whetham's, later 27th Foot, before joining Cotton's Foot, later Somerset Light Infantry in 1716, as a Major. In June 1722, he was commissioned as Lieutenant-Colonel Kerr's Dragoons, later 11th Hussars, a position he retained until late 1740. The period of comparative peace after 1713 ended with the outbreak of the War of the Austrian Succession, and in January 1741, Fowke became Colonel of a new regiment, the 43rd Foot. He exchanged into the Queen's Royal Regiment, then based in Scotland, and promoted Brigadier General in June 1745, three months before the 1745 Jacobite Rising. Minorca; Byng was executed in March 1757, Fowke dismissed As deputy to Sir John Cope, military commander in Scotland, he fought at Prestonpans in September; their army collapsed in the face of the Jacobite assault, in a battle lasting less than 15 minutes. Fowke commanded two regiments of dragoons, who fled without firing a shot, and halted only when they reached Berwick-upon-Tweed. He, Cope and Lascelles were later tried by a court-martial in 1746; while all three were exonerated, Cope never held command again. Fowke was posted to Flanders and became a Major General in 1747, shortly before the 1748 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle followed by an appointment as Governor of Gibraltar in 1752. The opening action of the Seven Years' War was the British naval defeat at Minorca in June 1756, an event that led to the trial and execution of Admiral John Byng. Fowke was court martialled for allegedly refusing to provide Byng with soldiers from the Gibraltar garrison; originally suspended for nine months, George II insisted he be dismissed from the army. Both he and Byng were viewed as unfairly singled out for a defeat brought about by general neglect. A 1757 Parliamentary committee noted the poor state of the island's defences, with crumbling walls and rotten gun platforms; over 35 senior officers were absent from their posts, including the governor and colonels of all four regiments in its garrison. This ended his career, although his rank was reinstated when George III succeeded in 1761. Legacy Gunston Hall, Virginia, named after Fowke's family home In 1651, Thomas Fowke's great-uncle Gerard moved to Virginia, along with his cousin, Philip Mason; one of their descendants was George Mason (1725‚Äì1792), a US Founding Father. In 1755, he commemorated his family roots by building a new house in Virginia named Gunston Hall; in 1923, another Mason built a second Gunston Hall, in North Carolina. Fowke kept a personal journal and record of correspondence; his papers for the period 1752 to 1755, including his time as Governor of Gibraltar, were acquired by in 2015 by the Lewis Walpole Library, part of Yale University. After his retirement, he lived near Park Hill, Yorkshire, now the site of the Park Hill estate, Sheffield, which was given listed building status in 1998.

The swan lake. Parque Centenario is an extensive public park in the Caballito district of Buenos Aires, Argentina. Overview Presiding over a rapidly expanding city, the Buenos Aires City Council in 1908 approved the purchase of a 10 hectare (25 acre) plot belonging to Parmenio Pi√±ero, a local brickmaker, for the purpose of a creating a \\"Westside Park\\" (the area was near Buenos Aires' western limits at the time). The project was entrusted to the City Parks Administrator, the renowned French Argentine urbanist Charles Thays, who completed the project in time for the 1910 centennial of the May Revolution (hence the park's name, Centenario). Rerouting two streets, Thays created a circular green space anchored by fountain in the middle. The outer sections of the park were planned for residential development, though these plans were later rescinded. The Museum of Natural Sciences.The Friends of Astronomy observatory. The outermost lots were made available to a number of cultural and scientific institutions, notably the Louis Pasteur Institute (founded in 1927), the Marie Curie Oncological Institute (1931), the Bernardino Rivadavia Natural Sciences Museum, which relocated there from its original building in 1937, and the Argentine Friends of Astronomy Association, who opened their observatory at the park in 1944; the Leloir Institute - one of the nation's leading biotechnology research centers - and the Central Naval Hospital were both opened during the early 1980s in lots facing the park. President Juan Per√≥n had the central fountain replaced in 1951 by an amphitheatre with a capacity for 20,000 spectators, a structure lost to arson in 1959. Mayor Osvaldo Cacciatore had a shallow lake built over 2000 m¬≤ (21,000 ft¬≤) of the central section of the park during the late 1970s, later populated with ducks, swans and other waterfowl. The mile-long perimeter became a popular joggers' route and a number of important public institutions had been opened along the park's surroundings. Parque Centenario increasingly suffered from neglect during the 1980s, a trend underscored by the 1989 theft of the iconic bronze female nude in sculptor Luis Perlotti's Fountain of the Irup√© Flower. Mayor An√≠bal Ibarra initiated an ambitious restoration project for the park in 2005, resulting in the reconstruction of the amphitheatre, the refurbishment of the swan lake and the creation of a number of new facilities. The park's refurbishment was concluded in May 2009, and the new, 2,000 seat amphitheatre was inaugurated with a performance by the City Tango Orchestra. Mayor Mauricio Macri's decision to install a perimeter fence around the park in 2013, however, resulted in a violent protest by opponents of the plan.

Like most other zygomycete fungi, the Zoopagomycotina have cell walls containing chitin and have coenocytic (nonseptate) hyphae. Their vegetative body consists of a simple, branched or unbranched thallus. Asexual reproduction is by arthrospores (in Helicocephalum), chlamydospores, uni- or multi-spored sporganiola; sporangiospores of multi-spored formed in simple or branched chains (merosporangia), usually from a vesicle or stalk. Many produce haustoria. Where observed, the sexual spores (zygospores) are globose and unornamented. The hyphae used during sexual outcrossing is similar to vegetative hyphae or in some cases may be slightly enlarged. Etymology The word Zoopagomycotina comes from the Greek roots zoo meaning ‚Äúanimal‚Äù and pag meaning ‚Äúrock‚Äù or ‚Äúice/frost.‚Äùurl=http://www.oed.com Evolutionary relationships phyla and subphyla in kingdom Fungi Phylogeny of Zygomycota Although great strides have been made in resolving the evolutionary relationships among many lineages of fungi, it has been challenging to resolve relationships within and among zygomycetes. For example, the uncertain grouping of Zoophagus insidians with the Kickxellomycotina. Resolving a well- supported monophyly of the Zoopagomycotina has been particularly challenging for several main reasons: 1) most species of Zoopagomycotina are microscopic and challenging to observe, 2) most species of Zoopagomycotina cannot be grown separately from their host organisms in axenic culture, so obtaining pure DNA for molecular studies is challenging, and 3) based on ribosomal DNA sequences, species of Zoopagomycotina may have undergone accelerated evolution, so grouping may be skewed by long-branch attraction (LBA) and a high frequency of parallel evolutionary changes.

Biography Born in Brest-Litovsk, now Brest, Belarus, Freed's family emigrated to the United States when Freed was three years old and settled in Philadelphia, where his father owned a music store. Freed began playing piano at age seven, and began composing at age nine. Freed's formal music education was at the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned a bachelor's degree at the age of 18. After graduation from Penn, Freed briefly held a teaching post at The Curtis Institute of Music. In 1924, he married Riva Hoffmann, a dancer in Isadora Duncan's troupe. Following this Freed went to Berlin where he briefly studied piano with Josef Weiss, and then to Paris where he studied composition with Ernest Bloch, Nadia Boulanger, Louis Vierne and Vincent d'Indy. He also studied piano with J√≥zef Hofmann and George Bayle, and organ with Rollo Maitland. Freed returned to the United States in 1934, and shortly after he was employed by the composition department at Temple University from the mid-1930s until the mid-1940s, but sources disagree as to the dates of his appointment. In 1944, Freed was named head of the composition department at the Hartt School of Music (now known simply as The Hartt School), where he taught in various capacities until his death in 1960. In 1951 he was also hired as Harmony instructor at the Hebrew Union School of Sacred Music. He also served as a radio commentator for performances of the Philadelphia Orchestra, and edited a number of scores in conjunction with Lazare Saminsky. Freed died in Rockville Centre, New York on November 10, 1960. Freed's work Freed's primary contribution to scholarly discourse is his book, Harmonizing the Jewish Modes, a theoretical treatise discussing Jewish sacred music in the context of Western European music theory, particularly the synagogue mode and its lack of a strong tonic-dominant relationship. Freed was also active as a synagogue musician, acting as organist and choirmaster at Temple Keneseth Israel in Philadelphia. His work as a synagogue musician led him to compose Jewish liturgical works, beginning with his Sacred Service for Shabbat Morning, published in 1939. Many feel that this is his most enduring musical work. In 1946, he was commissioned by the Julius Hartt Foundation to write an opera, The Princess and the Vagabond which was premiered at the Hartt School two years later. In 1944 he received prizes for two works: Triptych for violin, viola, violoncello and piano, and Postscripts, a choral work which won the Eurydice Choral Prize. His Rhapsody for Trombone and Orchestra, received a radio broadcast premiere in New York in 1951. After the composer's death, the National Jewish Music Council published a brief biography of Freed, A Jewish Composer by Choice: Isadore Freed, His Life and Work, which contains reminiscences of Freed's life and works by such luminaries as Pierre Monteux, who programmed Freed's Jeux de Timbres for concerts in San Francisco and Amsterdam in 1937, the same year in which Freed became the first American composer to be guest conductor for the NBC Symphony Orchestra. Freed was both a secular and sacred composer with deep interest in Jewish liturgical music as well as the promotion of contemporary secular music, being a co-founder of the Philadelphia Society for Contemporary Music and the Philadelphia Chamber Orchestra and Composers' Laboratory, the latter of which was superseded by the WPA Music Project Composers' Forum Laboratory.

Shortly after graduating high school, Singletary (who was actively pursuing a career as a musician at the time) was asked by Dante Marioni to work as a night watchman at what was then the Glass Eye, a Seattle glass-blowing studio. Singletary quickly moved from being night watchman to working the day shift to eventually joining one of the studio‚Äôs production teams. In 1984, Singletary took part in a workshop at Pilchuck Glass School for the first time. He has since been involved in Pilchuck as a teacher, student, and more recently as a member of its Board of Trustees. Singletary has blown glass around the world in countries such as Sweden, Italy, and Finland. In the late 1980s, Singletary began incorporating traditional Tlingit themes into his work and reaching out to other Northwest Coast Native American artists.Ganglehoff, Bonnie. \\"Glass Act.\\" Southwest Art.

Background  Article One of the United States Constitution, Section 8, Clause 18, allows Congress \\"to exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever, over such District (not exceeding ten miles square) as may, by cession of particular states, and the acceptance of Congress, become the seat of the government of the United States, and to exercise like authority over all places purchased by the consent of the legislature of the state in which the same shall be, for the erection of forts, magazines, arsenals, dockyards, and other needful buildings.\\" The rights of residents of such federal enclaves was argued in Howard v.

That was rejected, and it was ruled that the enclaves continue to be part of the states of which they were a part: \\"A state may conform its municipal structures to its own plan, so long as the state does not interfere with the exercise of jurisdiction within the federal area by the United States.\\" In 1963, a Maryland Appeals Court ruled, in Royer v. Board of Election Supervisors, that residents of federal jurisdictions were not entitled to vote in Maryland. Land in Montgomery County, Maryland, was purchased for the National Cancer Institute in the 1930s and was officially made a US jurisdiction in 1953. Both before and after the cession of the land, residents of the complex registered and voted in Montgomery County without incident. Then, in October 1968, the Permanent Board of Registry of Montgomery County, Maryland, citing Royer v. Board of Elections Supervisors, announced that persons living on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) federal reservation or enclave located within its geographical boundaries did not meet the residency requirement of Article 1 of the Maryland Constitution. The people were thus not qualified to vote as residents of Maryland. Several residents of the enclave sued the Permanent Board for a three-judge Federal District Court to be convened to enjoin as unconstitutional the application of the Maryland voter residency law. The Federal District Court issued a temporary injunction allowing residents to vote in the 1968 elections. In the actual argument of the case, the District Court held that to deny the residents the right to vote was to deny them equal protection of the laws, but the case was appealed to the Supreme Court.  Decision  The Supreme Court, in a decision written by Justice Marshall, joined by Justices Black, Douglas, Harlan, Brennan, Stewart, White, and Chief Justice Burger, ruled that the precedent of Howard meant that the complex was part of Maryland and so its residents counted as residents of Maryland in every other way and had substantial interest in the governance of the enclave. As it was subject the legislation of the state and county, they could not be denied the vote without violating their constitutional right to equal protection. Justice Blackmun did not take part, and there were no dissensions or concurrences.  Subsequent developments  Evans v. Cornman is often cited, usually among other precedents, in cases concerning violations of the Fourteenth Amendment, as it pertains to voting rights and representation, especially in cases concerning residency requirements (Oregon v. Mitchell, Mobile v. Bolden, Whatley v. Clark, Dunn v. Blumstein, etc.). The case has recently been cited in arguments in favor of national representation for the District of Columbia.

It is native to California and Oregon, where it grows along the coast and in dry and open meadows, prairies and forest clearings. It is a member of several plant communities, including coastal sage scrub, chaparral, northern coastal scrub, foothill woodland, and yellow pine forest. Description A lupine seedling at the site of a 2004 California wildfire Lupinus albifrons is a perennial shrub, taking up about of space and reaching . It has a light blue to violet flower on stalks. The leaves are silver with a feathery texture. Cultivation This plant grows as a wildflower in the hills and valleys of California. It requires good drainage and needs little water once the roots are established. Toxicity to livestock The plant is deer-resistant due to the presence of the bitter- tasting alkaloid toxins anagyrine and lupinine.Effects of Experience and Lactation on Lupine Consumption by Cattle Because of these toxins lupines can negatively affect livestock, causing birth defects and decreasing weight especially in young, inexperienced cattle. When cows are under stress from lactating, especially in times of low forage availability, they will consume more lupine than usual. Mission blue butterfly The federally endangered mission blue butterfly requires either Lupinus albifrons, Lupinus formosus and Lupinus variicolor, on which their larvae feed.Essig Museum of Entomology The butterfly becomes toxic itself when it feeds on the plant, leaving it with a bitter taste to deter predators. Due to its potential danger to livestock, this lupine is removed from rangeland when possible, eliminating a crucial food plant from the butterfly's range.

History Private and locally established common schools existed in the old Mississippi Territory in what is now Alabama. The 1819 State Constitution declared: > Schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged in this > State; and the General Assembly shall take measures to preserve, from > unnecessary waste or damage, such lands as are or hereafter may be granted > by the United States for the use of schools within each township in this > State, and apply the funds, which may be raised from such lands; in strict > conformity to the object of such grant.

In 1822, Athens State University was established as a private institution called the Athens Female Academy. It did not become a public school until 1974. LaGrange College was established as a private college in 1830. It was destroyed during the war and reestablished in 1872. It is now the University of North Alabama. In 1850, there were 1,323 schools with about thirty-seven thousand students enrolled. The state's voters approved a referendum calling for free public schools for white children in 1852. The legislature approved funding for such schools in the 1854 Public Schools Act. This decision was not without controversy. The 1858 Report of the Superintendent of Education, Gabriel B. Du Val discussed the population's attitude toward education, \\"Fortunately however for Alabama, and it is believed the Southern States generally, this indifference has not been felt toward education itself but toward governmental aid in procuring it. The happy condition of our social relations and general diffusion of wealth has rendered it comparatively unnecessary, wherever it was needed private generosity generally anticipated public aid.\\" By 1860, about a quarter of white school-aged children were enrolled. The 1868 constitution required free, racially integrated public school funded by the state. During this period, it was a crime in Alabama to teach a slave to read. In 1880, a quarter of all whites over the age of ten were illiterate. The number was 18.84% in 1890 and 14.8% in 1900. Only two states, South Carolina and Louisiana had lower figures. Comparable national illiteracy rates are 1880 17%, 1890 13% and 1900 11%. In 2012, the state reported 14.8% of all adults were illiterate. Recent reports use different standards of illiteracy than earlier compilations, and so the numbers are not completely comparable. In the 1890s, about 25% of white and 38% of black students who entered the first grade left in their first month, unable to pay tuition. The state's 1901 constitution prohibited both racially integrated schools and state aid to religious schools. It reduced property taxes but required schools to be funded by the localities using tuition and user fees. Eighty days of schooling per year was made mandatory in 1915, but the requirement could be waived for the very poor. The state began to require each county to have a high school, and by 1918 all but ten counties met the obligation. By the mid-1930s, two-thirds of the children of landowners reached high school, but only a third of the children of white sharecroppers. In an effort to reduce illiteracy the state created \\"Opportunity Schools\\" in 1920. These schools enrolled young adults who had not completed fourth grade. The schools taught basic reading and writing to the fourth-grade level. As a reaction to Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, both state and local officials took steps to preserve de facto educational segregation. In 1955, the state allowed public schools to use intelligence and other tests to assign students. Such tests were a method to keep schools segregated. The state also allowed public funds to flow to private schools that admitted only students of one race. In 1956, the Autherine Lucy, the first black student admitted to the University of Alabama, was expelled. In 1958, John Patterson was elected governor on a platform that promised \\"if a school is ordered to be integrated, it will be closed down\\". As late as 1965, schools in Jefferson County were still completely segregated. Since 2000, eleven school districts have been established by breaking away from the county schools. This has eroded the tax base for the county schools and increased racial segregation. Primary and secondary education Public primary and secondary education in Alabama is under the overview of the Alabama State Board of Education as well as local oversight by 67 county school boards and 60 city boards of education. Together, 1,541 individual schools provide education for 743,364 elementary and secondary students. Public school funding is appropriated through the Alabama Legislature through the Education Trust Fund. In FY 2006‚Äì2007, Alabama appropriated $3,775,163,578 for primary and secondary education. That represented an increase of $444,736,387 over the previous fiscal year. In 2007, over 82 percent of schools made adequate yearly progress (AYP) toward student proficiency under the National No Child Left Behind law, using measures determined by the state of Alabama. In 2004, 23 percent of schools met AYP. While Alabama's public education system has improved, it lags behind in achievement compared to other states. According to U.S. Census data from 2000, Alabama's high school graduation rate ‚Äì 75% ‚Äì is the second lowest in the United States, after Mississippi.https://www.census.gov/prod/2003pubs/c2kbr-24.pdf The largest educational gains were among people with some college education but without degrees.Education Statistics. CensusScope.org This value dropped to 72% for the 2010‚Äì2011 school year, but at least 8 states had a lower figure than Alabama that year. There have been concerns about literacy. 130 high schools out of 367 in the state either failed reading or were classified as \\"borderline\\" for 11th graders for the school year 2008‚Äì2009. 60% of Alabama's school systems had at least one school that failed reading or was borderline. The state provides education from Kindergarten through grade 12. It has also established a pre-kindergarten program. This program was recognized in 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 as having the highest quality standards, tied for first place with North Carolina. In addition to state funded pre-k programs administered through the state, some public schools in the state offer pre-k through the use of local and federal funds. The appropriation for the state funded pre-k program is $18,376,806. Currently, 7% of the state's four year olds participate in the First Class program. Although unusual in the West, school corporal punishment is not uncommon in Alabama, with 27,260 public school studentsPlease note this figure refers to only the number of students paddled, regardless of whether a student was spanked multiple times in a year, and does not refer to the number of instances of corporal punishment, which would be substantially higher. paddled at least one time, according to government data for the 2011‚Äì2012 school year. The rate of school corporal punishment in Alabama is surpassed only by Mississippi and Arkansas. Colleges and universities Harrison Plaza at the University of North Alabama in Florence. The school was chartered as LaGrange College by the Alabama Legislature in 1830. Alabama's programs of higher education include fourteen four-year public universities, numerous two-year community colleges, and 17 private, undergraduate and graduate universities. Public, post- secondary education in Alabama is overseen by the Alabama Commission on Higher Education. Colleges and universities in Alabama offer degree programs from two-year associate degrees to 16 doctoral level programs. Accreditation of academic programs is through the Southern Association of Schools and Colleges as well as a plethora of subject focused national and international accreditation agencies. Charter schools Alabama has no charter schools. Governor Bob Riley (R) proposed charter schools to the Alabama legislature, but the proposition was killed in House and Senate committees in February 2010. Opposition to charter schools has come from politicians, city and county school systems, and the Alabama Education Association.

The French planned to land 100,000 French soldiers in Britain to end British involvement in the war. The invasion was one of several failed and defeated French attempts during the 18th century to invade Britain. Background The War of the Austrian Succession ended in 1748 with the Peace of Aachen. All of its signatories considered it unsatisfactory; in France \\"as stupid as the peace\\" became a catch phrase. Frustrated by the loss of Silesia to Prussia, Maria Theresa of Austria looked for an alliance which would enable her to recover it. This led Austria to an historic rapprochement with France. France was prepared to ally with her historic enemy because this would, the Conseil du Roi thought, allow her to concentrate her efforts against Great Britain in a future war. In reaction, Prussia, which had emerged from the war as a newly significant European power, allied with her previous enemy, Great Britain. By 1755 Britain and France were fighting an undeclared war at sea and on the Indian frontier of North America; for example: in May, 2,000 British soldiers invaded French North America; in June, the Royal Navy captured nearly 300 French fishing vessels off Newfoundland and their 4,000 crew, both hitting France economically and reducing the French navy's potential recruitment pool of experienced seamen. The invasion of Saxony by Prussian troops, in August 1756, triggered what was later known as the Seven Years' War. France supported Austria and Russia in a land campaign against Prussia, and launched what she saw as her main effort in a maritime and colonial offensive against Great Britain. By the beginning of 1759 neither alliance had the advantage, in either the land or sea campaigns. Both France and Great Britain were having serious problems financing the war. In 1759 over 60% of French revenue went to service its debt, causing numerous shortages. The French navy in particular was overstretched and suffered from the lack of a coherent doctrine, exacerbated by the inexperience verging on incompetence of the Secretary of State for the Navy, Nicolas Ren√© Berryer, a former chief of police. Meanwhile, Britain's war effort over the first three years of the war had been a failure. From the summer of 1757 the British war effort came under the control of William Pitt, who imposed an assertive and coordinated strategy. It consisted of a naval and colonial effort to expel the French from North America and ruin their maritime trade, while dispersing their efforts between fighting Prussia in Europe and attempting to defend the wide range of French overseas possessions. By early 1759 this was beginning to bear fruit. Invasion plansConception= Duc de Choiseul was the principal author of the invasion plan, with which he hoped to end the war against Britain with a single masterstroke. The invasion was planned by the Duc de Choiseul who became French foreign minister in December 1758 and effectively served as Prime Minister during the period of the mooted invasion. He wanted to launch a bold initiative that would knock Britain out of the war with one stroke. French pride had been stung the previous year by the ease with which the British had captured Louisbourg and launched amphibious raids on the French coast during 1758, such as that against Cherbourg. British financial subsidies and military aid to her only ally Prussia had kept that country afloat since 1756. Choiseul's brief as foreign minister was to overturn this situation. Choiseul was interested in the concept of a French invasion of Britain. He perceived that Britain's strength was its naval power. He saw that if a large French force managed to cross the Channel without being intercepted, it could triumph over the relatively weak British land forces. Choiseul initially ignored perceived wisdom that any invasion would have to involve French warships. He believed that trying to bring warships out of the blockaded port at Brest would cause unnecessary delays, and could be disastrous. A mixed force as he saw it would suffer the same fate as the Spanish Armada. A previous attempt by France in 1744 had to be abandoned. His conception was relatively simple: a massive fleet of flat-bottomed transport craft would carry an army of 100,000 troops across the Channel where they would be landed on the coast of southern England. An essential component of the plan was speed. The French would wait for a favourable wind and cross the Channel quickly. Once they landed, they believed they would easily overpower the small army Britain retained on home soil and end the war. Choiseul managed to overcome opposition in the French cabinet and the invasion was approved as the cornerstone of French strategy for 1759 along with an attempt to capture Hanover. =Jacobite involvement= Prince Charles Edward Stuart, after a portrait by Giles Hussey As part of the scheme the French considered trying to start a Jacobite rebellion, as they had in 1745, by sending the heir apparent of the Jacobite movement Charles Edward Stuart with or ahead of the invading forces. A secret meeting was arranged with Charles Stuart in Paris in February 1759, but it went badly. Charles turned up late and drunk, and proved surly and uncooperative. Convinced that the Jacobites were of little material help, Choiseul dropped them from the plan. From then on, any French landing would have to be entirely accomplished by French troops. He did however consider sending Charles to Ireland where he could be declared King of Ireland and lead a rebellion. Eventually the French decided to try to recruit Jacobite supporters without involving Charles directly in the operation ‚Äì as he was considered a potential liability. France also sought support from Denmark and Russia to provide troops and naval stores for the expedition, but both declined to participate. Sweden initially agreed to take part in the scheme by sending an invasion force to Scotland, but later backed out of this arrangement. The Dutch Republic, traditionally a British ally but neutral at the time, was deeply alarmed by the French actions, and demanded assurances that the French were not planning to place the pretender Stuart on the British throne, an action they believed would threaten their own security. The French ambassador assured them they were not. =British response= William Pitt was the British war leader, and mobilised Britain's defences against the invasion threat. The British were well aware of these developments through a well- established network of secret agents. On 19 February the British war cabinet met at Lord Anson's house to discuss the potential invasion. Both William Pitt and the Prime Minister, the Duke of Newcastle, were extremely bullish about the prospects of the campaign. A few proposals were made, such as stationing troops on the Isle of Wight, but the consensus was that existing strategy was already sufficient to deal with the invasion threat. No plans were made for the withdrawal of British troops in Germany or to request that Hanoverian troops be sent to defend Britain. Pitt was committed to despatching expeditions to French colonies around the world, a policy that had proved successful. It had, however, deprived Britain of necessary troops to defend itself from a European invasion. In response to this the government had pushed through a Militia Act which created a large militia to defend Britain. The fighting capabilities of this force were untested, though it provided the British with a much larger force on paper than her regular troops alone. General Ligonier estimated that he would have only 10,000 regular troops immediately available to resist any French landing. A tight blockade was maintained on major French ports throughout 1759 under the command of Admiral Edward Hawke. It proved crippling, as it denied France valuable colonial shipping supplies, and the ease with which the Blockaders kept the French fleet bottled up was shattering to French morale. Improvements in supply arrangements had enabled the British to maintain a continuous blockade, something they had failed to accomplish previously. The British shared conventional wisdom that any invasion would have to involve the Brest fleet, but kept a close watch on all potential departure points. =French preparations= French Fleet with French and Imperial German troops in Brest, 1759 During 1759 the French pressed on with their preparations. Hundreds of the flat-bottomed transport craft were constructed in Le Havre, Brest, St Malo, Nantes, Morlaix and Lorient. An estimated 30 million livres was spent on the construction of the boats. A number of small but well-armed escorts were also constructed. By midsummer, more than 325 transports were nearing completion. 48,000 troops were immediately ready to take part in the invasion. Drills were conducted which found the French troops could embark and disembark from the ships in just seven minutes. Throughout the year, several points of the plan were altered, but it remained the same in essence. In spite of opposition from within the French cabinet (particularly the war minister Belle-Isle), Choiseul insisted on launching the crossing without fleet support. The French decided to launch the invasion force entirely from Le Havre, a large harbour some distance from the blockading British fleet at Brest. A smaller diversionary force would leave from Dunkirk. Sir Edward Hawke's ships kept up a constant blockade of the French coast throughout 1759 In June, French planners agreed that a separate, smaller force would be sent to Scotland to try and gain Jacobite support, and crush British resistance in a pincer movement. The Duc d'Aiguillon was selected to take command of this force. Once landing on the Clyde approximately 20,000 Scottish Jacobites, mostly Highland clansmen, would rise and join him. Command of the larger southern invasion was given to Prince Soubise. Plans called for Soubise's force to wait for good winds, and then cross the Channel speedily from Le Havre landing in Portsmouth. French naval defeatsRaid on Le Havre= A surprise British raid on Le Havre in early July did considerable damage, destroying a number of the transports. However, the success of the venture lured the British commanders into a false sense of security, making them believe it had been a greater setback than it had in fact. The French intended to capitalise on this, but scaled back their initial plans. A War Council in Paris decided to launch the expedition to Scotland first, and if it was successful, send follow-up forces to Portsmouth and Maldon, Essex. Exact details were left vague to enable them to respond to changing circumstances. Delays to the assembly of the invasion force pushed back the date of the launch, and the sea grew rougher and more dangerous to cross. Some French leaders were wary of putting the fleet to sea in potentially bad weather, but the need for a major victory to restore French morale and win an honourable peace overruled their concerns. In October, D'Aiguillon arrived at his command centre at Vannes, near to where much of his army had gathered. For five days after 15 October, the British blockading squadrons were forced to withdraw from the French coast by a storm, leaving the French invasion forces free to sail. Conflans declined to leave harbour, as he believed his fleet was not ready, and on 20 October the British returned to blockade the French Atlantic ports again. =Battle of Lagos= In summer 1759, the French Toulon fleet under Admiral La Clue slipped through the blockade and sailed out through the Straits of Gibraltar. They were caught and defeated by a British fleet at the Battle of Lagos in August. Their intended destination had been the West Indies, but the loss of ships and men stretched the French fleet almost to the breaking point, and raised questions about the viability of the invasion. =Battle of Quiberon Bay= Quiberon Bay proved a devastating setback to the planned invasion, and was one of the major reasons behind its ultimate cancellation The invasion plan received a crippling blow in November, when the French Brest Squadron was heavily defeated at the Battle of Quiberon Bay. Conflans had sailed from Brest on 15 November heading a hundred miles down the coast to Quiberon Bay, where the invasion army was now waiting to board his transports. Conflans' fleet became caught in a storm which slowed them down and allowed the pursuing British under Sir Edward Hawke a chance to catch up with them. Meeting at the mouth of Quiberon Bay on 21 November, the two fleets closed in on each other. Conflans initially formed a line of battle and prepared to engage, but then changed his mind and his ships raced to take shelter in the bay. Hawke pursued, taking a high risk in the middle of a violent storm, and captured or drove ashore five French ships. The remainder managed to find shelter in the bay. They were now blockaded in by the British fleet, and most were abandoned and their guns taken off them. Only three ships ever sailed again, a devastating setback to the French Channel fleet. The crushing defeat at Quiberon Bay ended any real hope of a major invasion of the British Isles. Landing in Ireland A privateer, Fran√ßois Thurot, sailed from Dunkirk with five ships to provide diversionary support to the invasion. In 1760 he landed on the northern Irish coast and set up a base at Carrickfergus. Had he not repeatedly clashed with the commander of the land expedition, the force might have captured poorly defended Belfast. Having sailed for home, the Royal Navy killed Thurot and destroyed his squadron in the Irish Channel. By this point, the French had abandoned the invasion. However, many French people took heart from Thurot's expedition as it demonstrated that French forces could land in the British Isles. Madame de Pompadour suggested that France would have won at Quiberon, had Thurot been in command instead of Conflans. Abandonment With the Brest fleet destroyed at Quiberon Bay, they were now unable to escort the French troops across the Channel. Some now began pressing Choiseul for a return to the original plan of an unescorted crossing, suggesting that the invasion be postponed to early 1760. 1759 was a disastrous year for the French war effort. They suffered severe defeats in Canada, the West Indies, Europe and India. Choiseul was particularly disappointed by the poor performance of the French navy.Murphy pp. 211‚Äì12 As word of these disasters poured in, the extent to which France's forces were now stretched became clear. Realising they needed the French forces earmarked for the invasion elsewhere, particularly in Germany to fight Hanover, Choiseul reluctantly called off the invasion. He remained hopeful that it might still be possible at some future date, but the war situation continued to deteriorate for France during the next few years particularly when Spain entered the war as a French ally in 1761. Choiseul began in 1762 to plan a fresh invasion, but this was also abandoned when an armistice was signed. Aftermath The French fully abandoned the plan in 1763, when the Peace of Paris mandated a general cessation of hostilities. Choiseul continued to advocate a direct strike against Britain as the way to win future wars, and despatched engineers and agents to examine British defences in preparation. During the Falklands Crisis of 1770 he proposed a similar action, but was dismissed by the French King, Louis XV. Further French invasions were planned in 1779 during the American War of Independence, and by Napoleon in 1803‚Äì04, but none came to fruition for much the same reasons as Choiseul's 1759 campaign had been abandoned.

Subjects assessed include Mathematics, Science, Language Arts, and Social Studies. These tests are initially offered during students' eleventh-grade year, allowing for multiple opportunities to pass the tests before graduation at the end of twelfth grade.GA DOE ‚Äì Testing ‚Äì GHSGT .

The HOPE Scholarship, funded by the state lottery, was available to all Georgia residents who have graduated from high school with a 3.0 or higher grade point average and who attend a public college or university in the state. The scholarship covers the cost of tuition and provides a stipend for books for up to 120 credit hours. If the student does not maintain a 3.0 average while in college they may lose the scholarship in which case they will have the chance to get it back by bringing their grade point average above a 3.0 within a period of 30 credit hours. This scholarship has had a significant impact on the state university system, increasing competition for admission and increasing the quality of education. In 2011, facing a budget shortfall, the state cut portions of the HOPE scholarship. Bill 326 trimmed scholarships by 90 percent. High school seniors who earn a 3.7 GPA and a 1200 on the SAT will still be able to get a full scholarship under the new law.

Department of Education The Maine Department of Education (DOE) administers public education in the state. It is run by a commissioner appointed by the governor. It concerns itself with academics. It does not concern itself with what public school staff does to their students. Local municipalities and their respective school districts operate individual public elementary and secondary schools but the DOE audits performance of these schools. The DOE also makes recommendations to state leaders concerning education spending and policies. Primary and secondary schools Education is compulsory from kindergarten through the twelfth grade, commonly but not exclusively divided into three tiers of primary and secondary education: elementary school, middle school or junior high school and high school. =Standards= The state is participating in a 30-state Common Core State Standards Initiative and assessment of students to replace the New England NECAP test. The state intends to use the new standards by 2015. The test will be given in grades 3-8 and at the end of grade 11 (junior year). Public school districts Maine has four types of school departments: the first is a local school, one which serves only one municipality, and is headed by a superintendent. Usually, it serves kindergarten through grade 12, although some only go to grade 8. Usually, independent school districts which do not have a high school are not totally independent; they are part of a school union, the second type of school district. A school union is two or more school departments that share a superintendent but nothing else; each town has an independent school board. Usually, only one of the schools in the school union has a high school, but unlike MSADs (discussed below), students in the whole school union are not compelled to attend that school. School union students are given a choice of neighboring school districts, and the school union pays for the student's tuition. The third type is a MSAD (Maine School Administrative District). This is a regional school district that incorporates two or more towns into one school department with one high school and middle school. These towns do not have independent school boards, but instead have one central board governing the entire district. Students are obligated to attend the central high school. Usually, a MSAD comprises one larger town and one or more smaller towns. The larger town is equipped with a high school and middle school, while the surrounding towns have elementary schools as well, but no secondary schools. The elementary schools usually cut off after grade 5 or grade 6. Sometimes, towns in a MSAD do not have an elementary school but possess a high school and/or middle school, whereas the surrounding towns have the elementary schools. The last type of school district is a CSD (Community School District, sometimes called a Consolidated School District). This usually (but not always) exists in school districts with such a small student population between several towns that the school district cannot justify an elementary school outside the largest town in the district. In rare cases a CSD refers to only a high school of a school union. Sometimes, in towns geographically isolated (such as island towns) the entire student population attends one school grades PK‚Äì12. Students can choose to attend a school in another district if the parents agree to pay the school tuition. Vocational centers are usually regional, so one school department will administer a technical center but other school districts will transport their students there to take classes. Private schools Private schools are less common than public schools. A large number of private elementary schools with under 20 students exist, but most private high schools in Maine can be perceived as \\"semi-private.\\" This means that while it costs money to send children there, towns will make a contract with a school to take children from a town or MSAD at a slightly reduced rate. Often this is done when it is deemed cheaper to subsidize private tuition than build a whole new school when a private one already exists. In addition to the many private elementary schools, there are several well-known private high schools and K-12 schools including Fryeburg Academy, Waynflete School, Berwick Academy, Cheverus High School and Catherine McAuley High School. Magnet schools Maine has one major magnet school: The Maine School of Science and Mathematics in Limestone. Another specialty public school exists in Portland: the Maine School of Performing Arts.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 11, 1975. The house was voted one of the top ten favorite buildings in Louisville by local residents in a contest by The Courier-Journal. History The house was built in 1868 for tobacco merchant Francis Ronald. In 1884, it was sold for $12,000 to Thomas Brennan, an equipment manufacturer and inventor who was originally from Ireland. He and his wife, Anna, had eight children who grew up in the house. Thomas Brennan (1838-1914) received accolades for his inventions, including two prizes at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair. He was co-owner and vice president of Brennan & Co., SouthWestern Agricultural Works, a manufacturer of farm machinery. The three-story townhouse has six bedrooms and features 16-foot ceilings. It was designed with stained-glass windows, an expansive veranda, hand-carved marble and slate mantels, and crystal chandeliers. The Brennan home was among the first in Louisville to have electric lights. Two of the Brennan sons became doctors, and one of them, Dr. J. A. O. Brennan, added a north wing to the house in 1912 for medical office space with waiting and exam rooms. One of Brennan's sons continued to live in the house until his death in 1963. At that time, the house was left to the Filson Club. The house was operated by the Filson Club as a house museum from 1969 until 1992, when a non-profit organization was created by the club to manage the house, as well as to help defray the costs of maintaining it. Today The Brennan House is now the home of Preservation Louisville, a non- profit advocacy organization whose mission is to protect and promote the city's cultural, architectural, and environmental heritage. The house is available for group tours and can be rented for weddings, parties, and other events. Annual Victorian holiday tours are held at the house. Inside, the house has been preserved with original interior finishes and lighting. The furnishings are from the Brennan family's personal collection.

The school's mascot was a Viking and the fight song was the Notre Dame Victory March.  History  The school originally opened as Vance Senior High in 1968, replacing Henderson High School near downtown Henderson. The new school was located approximately four miles North outside the town limits. It was expanded in 1974 adding M and L Suites and a second cafeteria. Most students and faculty affectionately refer to the cafeterias as the \\"Old\\" Cafeteria or the \\"New\\" Cafeteria, although both are primarily connected. In 1990, the school name was changed to Northern Vance High School, following a split in the student population by the school board in response to a growing population at the time. Southern Vance High School opened the same year, essentially taking half of Vance Senior High School's students. Later that same year. the newly minted Northern Vance High School befell violence after one student shot another in the halls. The student survived the shooting. The student who committed the crime calmly walked down the hall after the shooting, placing the gun on then Principal Wayne Adcock's desk, sat down and awaited his arrest by Vance County Sheriff's officials. The shooting made regional and national news headlines. The front page of the Town's Newspaper, The Henderson Daily Dispatch (then published Monday-Saturday in the afternoon), showed the victim being loaded into an ambulance with EMS workers and the school nurse. In March 2018, Vance County Schools announced that it was consolidating both high school campuses into one location as a cost-cutting measure. The new school, Vance County High School, would be located at the former Southern Vance High campus. Northern Vance later became the home of Vance Middle School, itself a consolidation of two other middle schools in the area.

The conversion rate is about 15.76%, almost triple that of 4-androstenedione, due to utilization of a different enzymatic pathway. There is also some conversion into estrogen, since testosterone is the metabolic precursor of the estrogens. 4-Androstenediol is closer to testosterone structurally than 5-androstenediol, and has androgenic effects, acting as a weak partial agonist of the androgen receptor. However, due to its lower intrinsic activity in comparison, in the presence of full agonists like testosterone or dihydrotestosterone (DHT), 4-androstenediol has antagonistic actions, behaving more like an antiandrogen. 4-Androstenediol is very weakly estrogenic.

Career  A former model and stage designer, he founded the eponymous fashion house in Florence and was acclaimed for his creations ever since his first appearance on the catwalks of Milan and Paris in 1977. His designs are recognizable for their bright colours, prevalence of chromaticism, exuberant fantasy of prints, and taste for eccentricity and enjoyment. The designer presented his first collection, Touche by Enrico Coveri, in Milan in 1973. His creative talent made him famous in the world of fashion and a representative of the taste \\"Made in Italy\\". His first collection for women was presented in Paris in 1977 and brought him instant success and praise of fashion press and opinion-makers. The menswear collection followed soon after. Sequins became his signature mark; Le Figaro wrote: \\"Sequins are to Coveri what chains are to Chanel.\\" The house of Enrico Coveri launched several collections for women, men and children, as well as a range of jeans. It added cosmetics to its offer in 1981. Coveri's first fragrance for women, launched in 1982 under the name Paillettes (sequins), was followed by his first fragrance for men, Enrico Coveri pour Homme. In Venice, at Palazzo Moretti, Coveri also threw one of the most extravagant masked balls. In 1985 the collection You Young Coveri, created for a young audience, was released. One of the most important awards the creator received was the Grande M√©daille de Vermeil in Paris in 1987. Enrico Coveri also received the title of Commendatore della Repubblica, which made him the only person under 35 to receive this accolade. When Enrico Coveri died from lung cancer in 1990, he was succeeded by his sister Silvana. She was familiar with the job, because she had been his manager and assistant. Francesco Martini Coveri, Silvana‚Äôs son and the most talented of Enrico‚Äôs nephews, also started to be active in fashion design, by becoming Creative Director of You Young Coveri. He became one of the leading figures of the fashion house and is now the main designer and artistic director. Some of the awards he received for his work are the Premio Ago d'oro in 1998, Premio Donna Circe, Premio Arte e Immagine nel mondo in 2002, as well as the American \\"2004 Designer of the Year Award\\". A special honour was paid to the house when a street was named after the designer in 2004: Piazzale Enrico Coveri in Prato. The house has 15 perfumes.

Upon graduation S√°nchez moved to New York City to specialize in gastroenterology at New York University while working as a resident in the Bronx. However, he quickly became absorbed with painting, his new-found hobby. Initially self-taught, his talent developed rapidly.

General Electric Co., 272 U.S. 476 (1926), is a decision of the United States Supreme Court holding (per Chief Justice Taft) that a patentee who has granted a single license to a competitor to manufacture the patented product may lawfully fix the price at which the licensee may sell the product.. Background GE's patent on the tungsten filament lamp, US Pat 1,018,502 -- one of the patents that the Supreme Court said completely covered the manufacture and sale of incandescent light bulbs GE owned three patents that ‚Äúcover[ed] completely the making of the modern electric lights with the tungsten filaments.‚ÄùGE, 271 U.S. at 481. GE accounted for 69% of total manufacture and sale of incandescent light bulbs, and Westinghouse, 16%. GE licensed Westinghouse to manufacture and sell light bulbs on the condition that Westinghouse should sell at prices that GE fixed and changed at its discretion.271 U.S. at 488. GE tungsten filament lamp embodying the invention of US Pat 1,018,502 -- one of those involved in the 1926 US v GE litigation Supreme Court opinion The Court pointed out that GE had not sold the light bulbs to Westinghouse but rather had granted Westinghouse a license to manufacture and sell the bulbs under GE‚Äôs patents. It was well settled that, under the exhaustion doctrine, ‚Äúwhere a patentee makes the patented article and sells it, he can exercise no future control over what the purchaser may wish to do with the article after his purchase. It has passed beyond the scope of the patentee's rights.‚Äù271 U.S. at 489. On the other hand, ‚Äúthe question is a different one‚Ä¶when we consider what a patentee who grants a license to one to make and vend the patented article may do in limiting the licensee in the exercise of the right to sell.‚Äù271 U.S. at 489-90. If all that the patentee does is grant a license to make, the Court said, the licensee only gets an implied license to use the article and not one to sell it. That raises the question of what happens if the patentee also licenses sale: > If the patentee goes further and licenses the selling of the articles, may > he limit the selling by limiting the method of sale and the price? We think > he may do so provided the conditions of sale are normally and reasonably > adapted to secure pecuniary reward for the patentee's monopoly. One of the > valuable elements of the exclusive right of a patentee is to acquire profit > by the price at which the article is sold. The higher the price, the greater > the profit, unless it is prohibitory. When the patentee licenses another to > make and vend, and retains the right to continue to make and vend on his own > account, the price at which his licensee will sell will necessarily affect > the price at which he can sell his own patented goods. It would seem > entirely reasonable that he should say to the licensee, \\"Yes, you may make > and sell articles under my patent, but not so as to destroy the profit that > I wish to obtain by making them and selling them myself.\\" He does not > thereby sell outright to the licensee the articles the latter may make and > sell, or vest absolute ownership in them. He restricts the property and > interest the licensee has in the goods he makes and proposes to sell.271 > U.S. at 490 (emphasis supplied). However, in , the patentee Adams assigned > the right to make, use, and sell the patented product (a coffin lid) within > a ten-mile radius of Boston to another, who manufactured the patented > product and sold it to Burke. Burke then took the product more than ten > miles from Boston and used it in his undertaking business to bury a > customer. Adams sued Burke for patent infringement, but the Supreme Court > held that the exhaustion doctrine freed Burke from infringement liability. That is the core of the opinion in the case, and the rule for which the GE case is usually cited today: the patentee may impose any conditions in a manufacturing license that ‚Äúare normally and reasonably adapted to secure pecuniary reward for the patentee‚Äôs monopoly.‚ÄùSee, e.g., (‚ÄúAs was said in United States v. General Electric Co., 272 U.S. 476, 489 (1926), the patentee may grant a license ‚Äòupon any condition the performance of which is reasonably within the reward which the patentee by the grant of the patent is entitled to secure.‚Äô‚Äù), quoted in The decision also upheld price fixing restrictions that GE imposed in agreements with agents for sale of bulbs that GE had manufactured. The Court ruled: ‚ÄúThe owner of an article, patented or otherwise, is not violating the common law or the Anti-Trust Act by seeking to dispose of his articles directly to the consumer and fixing the price by which his agents transfer the title from him directly to such consumer.‚ÄùGE. 271 U.S. at 488 (emphasis supplied). Subsequent developments The U.S. Department of Justice has been trying to overturn the 1926 GE decision almost since it was first handed down, and has twice seen it upheld by an equally divided 4-4 Supreme Court.; . Subsequent decisions of the Court, however, have repeatedly circumscribed the scope of the dispensation that the 1926 GE case offers.Robert A. Lipstein & Ryan C. Tisch, RPM in IP: RIP to Per Se?, Competition Law 360, The Newswire for Business Lawyer (April 9, 2007), at 2 (‚Äúcourts have nibbled away at [General Electric], leaving it a narrow rule surrounded entirely by wide exceptions‚Äù). It does not apply when several patentees pool their patentsSee Line Material, supra. or when the patentee has multiple licensees.See It does not apply when the patentee-licensor is not itself a manufacturer licensing competitive manufacturers. (licensor is patent holding company and licensees are manufacturers). See also It does not apply to a price-fix on an unpatented product made by a patented machine or patented method.See Cummer-Graham Co. v. Straight Side Basket Corp., 142 F.2d 646 (5th Cir. 1944); The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has continued to rely on what is termed, above, the core of the opinion. In Mallinckrodt, Inc. v. Medipart, Inc., the Federal Circuit relied on GE as the basis for its ruling that the patentee‚Äôs post-sale restrictions were not prohibited under the exhaustion doctrine. The Federal Circuit‚Äôs Quanta decision relied for its rationale on Mallinckrodt, and thus on GE. But the Supreme Court‚Äôs reversal of that decision in Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc. has created uncertainty about the continuing authority of this line of precedent and has left this area of law unsettled. In its initial brief in the Quanta case, as amicus curiae, the United States had pointed to the \\"seeming anomaly\\" between the two lines of authority that the GE case addresses.For a more detailed discussion of this issue, see the article on Quanta v. LGE. One line is represented by the Supreme Court's \\"exhaustion\\" cases such as United States v. Univis Lens Co.. and Quanta. Another line is reflected by such decisions and GE and General Talking Pictures Corp. v. Western Electric Co. The Mallinckrodt case seemed to expand the scope of the second line of authority at the expense of the first, but now Quanta may be reversing the direction of expansion. This area of law may thus remain unsettled for several years. Early in 2015, the Federal Circuit called for en banc briefing and argument of whether the Mallinckrodt case should be overruled, in light of Quanta.See Mallinckrodt‚ÄîContinued viability questioned. In February 2016, the Federal Circuit, in a 10-2 decision, reaffirmed Mallinckrodt..

The hospital, along with Marion National Cemetery were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999 as a national historic district. Note: This includes , site map, site map, and Accompanying photographs. History On July 23, 1888, with increasing membership amongst the six National Homes for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers (NHDVS), Congress established the seventh of ten national old soldiers' homes in Grant County, Indiana to be known as the Marion Branch. Congress allotted an appropriation of $200,000, while the Grant County residents provided a natural gas supply for the heating and lighting of this new facility. Marion, Indiana was selected as a site for the new branch due to the availability of natural gas and the political efforts of George Washington Steele.VANIHCS Marion, Indiana: A History, 2007 =George Washington Steele= During his last term, Colonel George Washington Steele introduced legislation for establishing a branch home in Grant County in the fiftieth session of congress, the measure coming up in December, and for seven months he watched the proceedings. Colonel Steele was not optimistic about the chances of Grant County receiving the National Home. In a letter sent to Simon Goldthwait two days before Congress approved the measure, Colonel Steele said that the bill \\"was in real danger.\\" The bill was approved by an Act of Congress and signed by President Grover Cleveland on July 23, 1888, entitled: \\"An Act to authorize the location of a Branch Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers in Grant County, Indiana, and For Other Purposes.\\" This legislation required a tract of land of at least with a natural gas well or wells on the site. The cost of drilling the wells was to be paid by Grant County citizens. Once the site and the gas supply were provided, the Board of Managers would begin construction within six months. The initial Congressional appropriation for the project was $200,000. Approval of Steele's bill was received with great enthusiasm in Marion, where the local newspaper predicted that the expenditure for the branch would total at least $500,000. News of the bills passing was favorably received in Grant County and on July 30, 1888 a celebration took place and it was estimated that the streets of Marion were thronged with the largest assemblage ever reported in Marion. = Construction= By October 1888, a tract had been purchased by a group of local citizens for donation to the Federal government for the National Home site. This tract was located in North Marion in a bend of the Mississinewa River on the \\"hilliest body of land in Grant County\\" from which there were views to the east and north as well as south to Marion.Historical Files, Indiana Room of the Marion Public Library: Marion Daily Chronicle, \\"Hip Hip Hurrah\\", July 23, 1888. However, this site proved to be unacceptable because the natural gas wells drilled on it were inadequate. Other sites were proposed. In February 1889, General Lew A. Harris and Colonel J. B. Thomas, serving as advisers to the Board of Managers, visited Marion to inspect possible sites for the branch. They made their headquarters the Spencer House. On March 2, 1889, an announcement was made that the selection of a site along Jonesboro Pike, 2 ¬Ω miles southeast of town, was announced. The site was assembled from of Geiger owned farmland which was purchased on March 28, 1889, and of land purchased from Isaac Elliott on April 10, 1889. These two tracts were purchased for approximately $110 per acre. The Federal Government only authorized up to $90 per acre, and therefore, local Grant County citizens donated the additional monies to ensure the construction of the Marion Branch. The site was later enlarged with the purchase of three additional tracts in 1894, 1896, and 1897, for a total of 298.84. On May 2, 1889, a group of men headed by Colonel Harris arrived to visit the home site. While visiting a demonstration of the natural gas well was given. This well is located east, across the street from Building 23. Construction of the Marion Branch began in 1889. A brick works was located on an adjacent farm which supplied the bricks for the original structures. The official opening for the Marion National Home was on March 18, 1890. The cost of land, buildings and permanent improvements totaled $698,000. Enrollment at the Marion Branch in 1890 was 586. The main hospital building, Building 19, was completed and patients began to be treated in the facility. Female nurses arrived for work from Cincinnati. =Operations= By 1892 a request for two additional barracks was made due to the VA reaching its veteran capacity of 1,241 members. During this time, members were sleeping on the floor due to lack of space. Enrollment steadily rose to reach 1782 members in 1901. With enrollment increasing due to the veterans returning from World War I, and with the 1917 amendment allowing all veterans the same medical care, additions to the National Home became necessary. By 1919, approximately 60 additional buildings had been constructed to include memorials, a fire station, warehouses, additional quarters, supply buildings, and greenhouses. The Marion Branch and all other homes were opened to both the white veteran and members of the United States Colored Troops. This integration was a full eighty years before the United States had fully integrated military units. The integration was rudimentary by today's standards. When the numbers permitted there were separate barracks and separate tables in the dining hall, but each man wore the same uniform, ate the same meals and performed similar duties. =World War I veterans= In 1921, the Marion Branch became the Marion National Sanitarium, a facility dedicated to the treatment World War I neuropsychiatric cases, including what was then called shell shock and other mental disorders. In August 1921, Congress acted to consolidate all veterans' benefits into a single independent agency, the Veterans Bureau. On April 29, 1922, this agency assumed responsibility for fifty-seven veterans' hospitals operated by the Public Health Service as well as nine under construction by the Treasury Department. By 1926, the Board began to see a new trend in veterans' use of the National Home. For the most part, the World War I veterans were receiving medical treatment and returning to civilian life rather than entering the domiciliary program for the Home. The Board noted that hospital care costs were almost three times the cost of domiciliary care and required large capital investments in hospitals, medical equipment, and professional staff. By 1928, the Board concluded that it was not capable of managing the National Home as a national medical service. In June 1929, the president of the Board of Managers was named to the Federal Commission for Consideration of Government Activities Dealing with Veterans' Matters; the work of this commission resulted in the creation of the Veterans Administration.  End of the National Home  In 1930 the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers, Veterans Bureau, and Bureau of Pensions were consolidated together into the new Veterans Administration. The National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers was renamed the \\"Home Service\\" within it. The Marion Branch was then renamed the Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Marion, Indiana. In 1996, the facility was integrated with the Fort Wayne facility by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, becoming the VA Northern Indiana Health Care System, Marion Campus.VA Northern Indiana Health Care System Cemetery A burial ground of was set aside from the buildings in memory of the men who offered their lives in defense of their country. \\"The Silent Circle\\" is designated as Section 1, which consists of seven concentric rows of graves. Each grave has a plain marble marker with the name of the deceased, along with the rank and regiment. Each marker is numbered in succession but does not indicate any order of death. There is a section that was reserved for the burial of employees and their families to include the first governor of The Home and the first surgeon of the hospital.

He is best known for the series of five readers for elementary school, L√¶sebog for folkeskolen (1892-1895), which became the most widespread schoolbook in Norway. Family Rolfsen was born in Bergen. His parents were merchant and later bank teller Rasmus Rolfsen and Jannikke Brun. He was great-grandson of poet and bishop to Bj√∏rgvin Johan Nordal Brun, and grandson of shipmaster, shipowner and member of the Norwegian Constitutional Assembly Jens Rolfsen. He married Hedevig Martha Hastrup Birch in 1885. He was the father of painter Alf Rolfsen. Early life Rolfsen finished his education at Bergen Cathedral School in 1866, and continued his studies in Christiania. He worked as a teacher at Aars og Voss' skole from 1870 to 1872 and at Fr√∏ken Falsens pikeskole from 1873 to 1876. He issued the collection of poetry and stories Under Sneen in 1874. In 1877 he moved to Bergen, working as an instructor at the theatre Den Nationale Scene. He became determined to be a dramatist, and travelled to Denmark, where two of his plays were performed, Ved Solnedgang (1878, Copenhagen) and En Valkyrie (1880, Copenhagen). During the 1880s he experimented with different literary genres. He edited the children's magazine Illustreret Tidende for B√∏rn from 1885 to 1894. His musical comedy Svein Ur√¶d (1890), with music by Ole Olsen, was a success on stage. Later life In 1890 the Rolfsen family moved from Bergen and settled in Kristiania. Rolfsen had sent an application to the Ministry of Church for funding the writing of new readers for elementary school, but his application was refused after a three days' debate in the Parliament of Norway. Instead he received funding from bookseller and publisher Jacob Dybwad. The readers L√¶sebog for folkeskolen were issued 1892-1895 (five volumes), and were later reissued numerous times. They would become the standard readers in Norwegian elementary schools until Thorbj√∏rn Egners leseb√∏ker took over in the 1950s. Rolfsen worked as a full-time writer and editor the rest of his life, and also as a translator, journalist, researcher and speaker. In 1894 he issued L√¶sebog for middelskolen. He was editor of the epos Norge i det nittende Aarhundrede (1900). Rolfsen was leader of the Norwegian Students' Society, and later chairman of the Norwegian Authors' Union. He was decorated Knight, First Class of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav in 1912.

He was influenced by makers of the previous generations such as Giovanni Battista Guadagnini and Tommaso Balestrieri, and between 1775 and 1795 manufactured a massive number of high-quality string instruments in a conventional manner. However, Storioni made some bold adjustments with his extreme creativeness. He changed the position of the F-hole, selected unusual materials such as local wild maple, and decorated his instruments with wide and rugged fringe, giving them strong but elegant looks as well as excellent sound. He used a spirit varnish which sometimes appears to have saturated the wood. His choice of wood was not always the best but that is due to the times in which he was living. From the 1750s to the end of the century Italy endured many wars and finding materials for instrument makers was at times very difficult. Decades of war, reforms, and repeated conquests by the French and Austrians dismantled the social and economic structure of Cremona as Duane Rosengard explains in a 1991 paper published in the Journal of the Violin Society of America (Citation needed). In the 1770s, just as Storioni emerged, the guilds that had governed the skilled crafts since the Middle Ages were abolished by the conquering Austrians. The Jesuit fathers, whose educational institutions were major patrons of the violin makers, were suppressed by the Pope; and the lay corporations, who conducted commerce on behalf of Cremona's religious orders, were abolished. The church and nobility‚Äîprimary patrons of the violin makers‚Äîlost power and money as the French and Austrians taxed and requisitioned treasure out of Italy to pay for the wars.\\"The Late Cremonese - by Erin Shrader STRINGS magazine Many of Storioni's instruments are of broad grain in the upper table. He enjoyed working with the Joseph Guarnerius model. He is known to have made magnificent double basses. His followers include Giovanni Battista Ceruti, Giovanni Rota and Giovanni Francesco Pressenda. \\"If rough work and poor wood characterized the Storioni-Rota-Ceruti school, they still find favor with musicians. ‚ÄúThey were not the tidy boys, but they‚Äôre all acoustically rock solid,‚Äù says Boston violin maker Marilyn Wallin, who enjoys working on them for this reason. ‚ÄúAs a group, they didn‚Äôt have the best wood, but they did know what to do with it.‚ÄùThe Late Cremonese - by Erin Shrader STRINGS magazine A bass that has been attributed to him is References *The Late Cremonese - by Erin Shrader STRINGS magazine * The Late Cremonese Makers - Dmitry Gindin Walter Hamma, Meister Italienischer Geigenbaukunst, Wilhelmshaven 1993, *\\" Lorenzo Storioni by John Dilworth, taken from the Amati Website Category:1751 births Category:1802 deaths Category:Luthiers Category:Italian musical instrument makers Category:Bowed string instrument makers ","title":"Lorenzo Storioni"},{"id":"21696254","text":"The HTC Touch Diamond2, a mobile phone designed by the HTC Corporation, is the successor to the popular HTC Touch Diamond.

The Ing√° Stone is also called Itacoatiara do Ing√°. The word Ita means \\"stone\\" in the Tupi language of the natives that lived in that area.This work researches the tourist potential of the Itacoatiara do Ing√° (Written Stone of Ing√°), 2003, by Jos√© dos Santos Martins (in Portuguese) It is a rock formation in gneiss which covers an area of approximately 250 m¬≤. Altogether primary, a vertical wall 46 meters long by 3.8 meters high, and adjacent areas, there are entries whose meanings are unknown. Several figures are carved in low relief in this set, suggesting the representation of animals, fruits, and human constellations like Orion and Milky Way. It is composed of some basalt stones covered with symbols and glyphs which are undeciphered until now. Scholars think it was created by natives that lived in the area until the 18th century. Unfortunately, the site is under constant danger of being damaged beyond repair by scavengers and vandals. Most glyphs represent animals, fruits, humans, constellations, and other unrecognizable images.  Archeoastronomical hypothesis  Glyph detail There is a hypothesis that provides petroglyphs of Ing√° an exceptional importance from the archeoastronomical point of view. In 1976, the Spanish engineer Francisco Pav√≠a Alemany started a mathematical study of this archaeological monument. The first results were published in 1986 by the Instituto of Arqueologia Brasileira (Pav√≠a Alemany F. 1986). He identified in Inga a series of \\"bowls\\" and another petroglyph etched into the vertical surface of the wall of Inga that formed a \\"solar calendar\\", over which a gnomon projected the shadow of the first solar rays of every day. The Agrupaci√≥n Astron√≥mica de la Safor published in 2005 a summary of this work in its official bulletin Huygens No. 53 (Pav√≠a Alemany F. 2005). Later, F. Pavia continued the study, focusing this time on a series of signs engraved on the rocky surface, which he interpreted as a large number of \\"stars\\" grouped forming \\"constellations\\". The coexistence of the \\"bowls\\" and the \\"constellations\\" in the same rock are thought to give it archaeoastronomical significance. In 2006, the Egyptologist and archeoastronomer Jose Lull coordinated the publication of a book entitled Trabajos de Arqueoastronom√≠a. Ejemplos de Africa, America, Europe y Oceania, a compendium of thirteen articles written by archeoastronomers. Among these items are \\"The archeoastronomical ensemble of Inga\\" where is exposed the study of both the bowls and constellations mentioned before and the reasons that justify Inga as an exceptional archeoastronomic monument, like no other in the world.

Annual precipitation depends on elevation: Yosemite Valley at gets a year. At the lower elevation of this forest, the hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters of the Mediterranean climate give rise to the lower montane forest zone. The accumulation of several feet of snow during the winter is not uncommon and can stay on the ground for several months. The diversity of tree species found in this zone make this a beautiful and interesting forest to explore. The indicator species for the lower montane forest are the ponderosa pine and the Jeffrey pine. Ponderosa pines are common in the west side forests at lower elevations. Jeffrey pines are commonly found in the East side forests at higher elevations and in drier areas. The lower montane forests also include trees such as California black oak, sugar pine, incense-cedar, and white fir. The giant sequoia groves of the Sierra Nevada are also found within this biotic zone. Animals that may be found in this zone include the dark-eyed junco, mountain chickadee, western gray squirrel, mule deer, and American black bear. The lower montane forest can be seen in Yosemite Valley and along the Wawona, Hetch Hetchy, and Big Oak Flat Roads. The lower montane forest consists of several layers: * Mostly secondary growth with partial to complete canopy closure * A understory consisting either of smaller trees or discontinuous shrubs * A low herbaceous cover * A woody fuel and litter layer Some threats to the lower montane forests include logging, grazing, changing fire regimes, fragmentation due to development, climate change, and pest outbreaks.

Amdahl (January 23, 1919 - August 24, 2010) was an American lawyer and judge from Minnesota. He served as Chief Justice of the Minnesota Supreme Court from December 1981 to January 1989. Early life and education Amdahl was raised in the small town of Mabel in southeastern Minnesota. He was the son of Olean and Beaulah Amdahl. His father, who was a Norwegian immigrant, operated a shoe repair shop. Amdahl served in World War II in the United States Army Air Force Signals Intelligence Service as a cryptologist within the European theater. After flying in and going ashore three days after the D-Day invasion of Normandy Beach, Douglas K. Amdahl coordinated efforts to decrypt German enigma communication and was briefly a tank commander at the Battle of the Bulge despite previously being prohibited from combat due to his poor eyesight. Career He served as a judge in Hennepin County from 1961 to 1980. While chief justice, Amdahl was a leader in establishing the Minnesota Court of Appeals, which was created in 1983. Prior to that, if a person believed a district judge erred in a ruling, the only avenue for appeal was the state supreme court, which could take up to three years to issue a ruling. The creation of the appeals court enabled a quicker resolution to cases and provided additional oversight in the judicial process.Jessica Mador Retired Minn. justice Douglas Amdahl dies Minnesota Public Radio.

Biography Early life and work = Born in a thirteen-room house in Saint Charles, Missouri and christened in the local Episcopal church, Kelly spent his youth on the banks of the Mississippi. His father was Cornish, while his mother was a descendant of the Calvert family, founders of the city of Baltimore. Once a partner of railroad magnate Thomas Alexander Scott, Kelly's father had lost his stake and took a job as a mine inspector, dying in poverty before Kelly's fifth birthday. Kelly left school after the fifth grade and worked as a pressman in printing companies in order to support his family. At twenty years old, he was wandering from city to city. He was hired as a salesman of printing equipment by the American Machine and Foundry Company of Cleveland, Ohio. It was during this time he became actively engaged in the trade union movement and was first exposed to anarchist ideas. He became a collaborator of Charles Mowbray on Boston's The Rebel, and when that ceased publication, published a paper called The Match, the first of three anarchist periodicals he founded in America. Kelly's contemporary Hippolyte Havel would later comment that \\"The Match went out all too suddenly, but while it burned it gave Kelly great pleasure and satisfaction.\\" = Years in England = Scholar Lawrence Veysey observed that Kelly shared with his father \\"at least two major traits‚Äîa migratory restlessness and a certain interest in books and ideas\\". Kelly moved to England in 1898, partly to meet his father's relatives, but also to engage with London's renowned circle of anarchist revolutionaries, a prospect which he had looked forward to with impatience. It was there, among newfound friends and comrades, anarchist thinkers and propagandists, that Kelly spent his happiest days, and in the words of Havel \\"fortified his ideal with historical, economical and social facts and data\\". In England, he worked alongside prominent anarchist intellectual Peter Kropotkin, with whom he formed a close friendship, visiting the Russian often at his home in Bromley, Kent and finding him to be an enthusiastic comrade and great teacher. Though he became increasingly less active in the labor movement whilst in England, he collaborated on the prominent London anarchist newspaper Freedom, alongside Kropotkin, Tcherkesow, Louise Michel, Max Nettlau and John Turner until his return to the United States in 1904. = Return to America = On his return from Europe, Kelly continued selling printing equipment for American Machine and Foundry until 1920, with the exception of several weeks in 1911 when he became a full-time professional organizer for the Francisco Ferrer Association of New York, an anarchist organization established to create Modern Schools in America based on the ideas of Francesc Ferrer i Gu√†rdia. Kelly worked as a salesman for several companies in the 1920s, including periods at the John Hancock Company and, for six months, the Metropolitan Insurance Company. Kelly struggled financially in the Great Depression, writing in 1932 that he had failed to earn enough in the preceding year to support himself, and being refused a TVA position after listing his political affiliation as \\"anarchist\\".  Thought and activism  On his return to the United States from England, Kelly established libertarian communities and schools in New York and New Jersey. He was an early resident of Free Acres, a social experimental community developed by Bolton Hall in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey.Buchan, Perdita. \\"Utopia, NJ\\", New Jersey Monthly, February 7, 2008. Accessed February 27, 2011. \\"Free Acres had some famous residents in those heady early days: actors James Cagney and Jersey City‚Äìborn Victor Kilian, writers Thorne Smith (Topper) and MacKinlay Kantor (Andersonville), and anarchist Harry Kelly, who helped found the Ferrer Modern School, centerpiece of the anarchist colony at Stelton in present-day Piscataway.\\" He was a co-founder and organizer of the Ferrer Modern School at Stelton Colony in Piscataway Township, New Jersey, which became the most successful and longest lasting anarchist colony in America. He left the colony in 1923, and went on to found the Mohegan Colony at Lake Mohegan, New York in 1925, and later the Mount Airy Colony at Harmon, New York. He was a close friend of Russian anarchists Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman, alongside whom he worked for years until their deportation under the Anarchist Exclusion Act in 1918. Kelly sought to establish an anarchist society founded on voluntary association, in which coercion and authority would be replaced with personal freedom, individual autonomy and mutual aid. \\"Anarchism\\", he wrote to anarchist historian Max Nettlau, \\"is an ideal to strive for but it requires patience and fortitude in an uncanny degree to live it.\\" In a speech celebrating Kelly's fiftieth birthday, Havel elaborated: Kelly's attitude towards his life divided between wage labor and activism was one of ambivalence.

This infraclass mostly consisted of marine limpets and operculate snails. At least 20,000 species were considered to exist within the two clades that were included, Heterobranchia and Caenogastropoda.http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/29828/Apogastropoda Description Gastropods that were placed in this taxon have bifurcate tentacle nerves and two pedal commissures.  Reasons for establishing  Older morphological and molecular studies appeared to show that the Caenogastropoda and Heterobranchia should be considered as sister taxa, comprising the Apogastropoda. This taxon was used in taxonomy of the Gastropoda (Ponder & Lindberg, 1997).  Reasons for rejection  However this taxonomic grouping is no longer used (according to the taxonomy of the Gastropoda by Bouchet & Rocroi, 2005). It is out-dated because more recent molecular studies have proved that it contains two separate evolutionary lineages, the two clades mentioned above. Apogastropoda was also rejected according to the nucleotide sequence of mitochondrial genome in 2008.

Special education In December 2013, Keystone Central School District administration reported that 739 pupils or 17.5% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 2.95% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. In December 2012, Keystone Central School District administration reported that 745 pupils or 17.3% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 56% of identified students having specific learning disabilities. In December 2010, Keystone Central School District administration reported that 775 pupils or 17.6% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 56% of identified students having specific learning disabilities. In December 2009, the district administration reported that 764 pupils or 20.8% of the district's pupils received Special Education services. In 2007, Pennsylvania Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak testified before the Pennsylvania House Education Committee regarding full-day kindergarten. He claimed that districts which offered the program would see a significant decrease in special education students due to early identification and early intervention. He asserted the high cost of full-day kindergarten would be recouped by districts in lower special education costs. Keystone Central School District has provided full-day kindergarten since 2003. The district has seen a slight decrease in the percentage of special education students it serves, but it has yielding no savings. The district engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Instructional Support Team or Student Assistance Team. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the district seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the district or contact the Supervisor of Special Education. The IDEA 2004 requires each school entity to publish a notice to parents, in newspapers or other media, including the student handbook and website regarding the availability of screening and intervention services and how to access them. Students who have an Individual Education Plan (IEP) may take the PSSA-M an alternative math exam rather than the PSSA.Eleanor Chute., Modified PSSA test in math offered for 1st time, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, April 18, 2010 Some special education students may take the PASA (Pennsylvania Alternate System of Assessment), rather than the PSSA. Schools are permitted to provide accommodations to some students. In 2012, the Obama Administration's US Department of Education issued a directive requiring schools include students with disabilities in extracurricular activities, including sports. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815 for special education services. The funds were distributed to districts based on a state policy which estimates that 16% of the district's pupils are receiving special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs.Browne, Patrick., Senate Education Committee Hearing on Special Education Funding & Accountability testimony, November 1, 2011 Over identification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education. The state requires each public school district and charter school to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students.Amy Morton, Executive Deputy Secretary, Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Pennsylvania Department of Education, November 11, 2011 Keystone Central School District received a $3,102,551 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011‚Äì12, 2012‚Äì13, 2013-14 school years, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010-11. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required.Department of Education, Investing in PA kids, April 2012 For the 2014-2015 school year, Keystone Central School District received an increase to $3,159,868 from the Commonwealth for special education funding.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Special Education funding report by LEA, July 2014 Additionally, the state provided supplemental funding for extraordinarily impacted students. The district must apply for this added funding. In 2013, the state's Special Education Funding Reform Commission provided a report on the state of funding for special education in the Commonwealth. Funding for special education programs is borne largely on a local basis at 60%, with the state contributing $1 billion or 30% and the federal government providing 10% of the funding. ;LRE monitoring In 2009, Keystone Central School District was identified by the Pennsylvania Department of Education for Least Restrictive Environment monitoring. One hundred ninety six schools districts were selected in 2008-09. The district received an alert letter from the PDE - Bureau of Special Education. School districts were placed in one of three categories: Tier 1, Tier 2 or Tier 3. The district was placed in Tier 2 due to students spending less than 21% of the school day, outside of regular education. The monitoring is a product of the PDE addressing its voluntary settlement in Gaskin V. Pennsylvania which ordered that special education students spend most of their school day (80%) in regular education classrooms with supplementary aids and services to assist funded by the taxpayers. In 2010, Keystone Central School District was assigned to the Tier 3 monitoring list, due to students spending less than 40% of their day in a regular education classroom. The district received a letter of \\"Warning\\" letter from the Pennsylvania Department of Education. =Gifted education= The District Administration reported that 41 or 3.62% of its students were gifted in 2009. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The primary emphasis is on enrichment and acceleration of the regular education curriculum through a push in model with the gifted instructor in the classroom with the regular instructor. This approach permits such specialized instructional strategies as tiered assignments, curriculum compacting, flexible grouping, learning stations, independent projects and independent contracts. Students identified as gifted attending the High School have access to honors and advanced placement courses, and dual enrollment with local colleges. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Wellness policy Keystone Central School Board established a district wellness policy in June 2006 - Student Wellness Policy 246. The policy deals with nutrition of meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 - 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity hat are aligned with the Pennsylvania State Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus.Nutrition Standards for Competitive Foods in Pennsylvania Schools for the School Nutrition Incentive, Pennsylvania Department of Education ‚Äî Division of Food and Nutrition. July 2008 The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for its approval. Keystone Central School District offers both a free school breakfast and a free or reduced-price lunch to children in low income families. All students attending the school can eat breakfast and lunch. Children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level are provided a breakfast and lunch at no cost to the family. Children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of the federal poverty level can be charged no more than 30 cents per breakfast. A foster child whose care and placement is the responsibility of the State or who is placed by a court with a caretaker household is eligible for both a free breakfast and a free lunch. Runaway, homeless and Migrant Youth are also automatically eligible for free meals.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs - Eligibility Manual for School Meals, 2012 The meals are partially funded with federal dollars through the United States Department of Agriculture.Pennsylvania Hunger Action Center, The Pennsylvania School Breakfast Report Card, 2009 In 2013, the USDA issued new restrictions to foods in public schools. The rules apply to foods and beverages sold on all public school district campuses during the day. They limit vending machine snacks to a maximum of 200 calories per item. Additionally, all snack foods sold at school must meet competitive nutrient standards, meaning they must have fruits, vegetables, dairy or protein in them or contain at least 10 percent of the daily value of fiber, calcium, potassium, and Vitamin D.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs, June 27, 2013 In order to comply with the Healthy, Hunger- Free Kids Act of 2010 all US public school districts are required to raise the price of their school lunches to $2.60 regardless of the actual cost of providing the lunch. The Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 mandates that districts raise their full pay lunch prices every year until the price of non- subsidized lunches equals the amount the federal government reimburses schools for free meals. That subsidy in 2013-2014 was $2.93. In 2014, President Barack Obama ordered a prohibition of advertisements for unhealthy foods on public school campuses during the school day. The Food and Drug Administration requires that students take milk as their beverage at lunch. In accordance with this law, any student requesting water in place of milk with their lunch must present a written request, signed by a doctor, documenting the need for water instead of milk. Keystone Central School District provides health services as mandated by the Commonwealth and the federal government. Nurses are available in each building to conduct annual health screenings (data reported to the PDE and state Department of Health) and to dispense prescribed medications to students during the school day. Students can be excluded from school unless they comply with all the State Department of Health's extensive immunization mandates. School nurses monitor each pupil for this compliance. Nurses also monitor each child's weight. In 2016, the Pennsylvania Department of Health distributed to each Pennsylvania high school the overdose antidote drug naloxone in a nasal spray. School nurses were also provided with educational materials and training developed by the National Association of School Nurses. The cost was covered by a grant from a private foundation. Bullying Policy The Keystone Central school administration reported no incidents of bullying occurring in the schools in 2009. The Keystone Central School Board prohibits bullying by district students. A policy approved in July 2009 defines bullying and cyberbullying. The Board directs that complaints of bullying shall be investigated promptly, and corrective action shall be taken when allegations are verified. No reprisals or retaliation shall occur as a result of good faith reports of bullying. The board expects staff members to be responsible to maintain an educational environment free from all forms of bullying. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct.

Title II grants The Federal government provides annual grants to schools to be used to improve the quality of teacher instructions to pupils. The goal is to provide each child in public schools with \\"Highly Quality\\" teachers and principals as defined by the state. The funds are sent to the state Department of Education which distributes them to each school district and charter school. Beginning in 2002, the federal funding committed to Title II was $3,175,000,000. Public school district administrations must apply to the state annually for the Title II funds.

For 2014-15, Keystone Central School District received $5,133 in Title III funding.PDE, Title III Grant Allocations 2014-15, 2014 =Real estate taxes= For the 2015-16 school year, the Keystone Central School Board set property taxes at 44.2200 mills for Centre County residents, for residents in Clinton County 12.1900 mills, and residents of Potter County at 38.0900 mills. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Unlike other states, under Pennsylvania state tax policy, natural gas and oil pipelines are exempted from property taxes. There are a plethora of gas pipelines in the district due to marcellus shale gas development. Pipeline companies prohibit development within the 100 foot wide right-of-way, there by limiting future development options for the landowner. This limits future potential property tax revenues for the school district, by constraining future land development. Located in the marcellus shale region, Keystone Central School District is adversely impacted in this way. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. The School District crosses three counties, each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, necessitating a state board equalization of the tax rates between the counties. In 2010, miscalculations by the State Tax Equalization Board (STEB) were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts, including Keystone Central and those that did not cross county borders. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation, within a community and across a region. In 2008, Clinton County conducted a county wide property reassessment. Upon completion of the reassessment the school board was required to reduce the millage rate to assure the school district received the same level of tax revenues for one year.Clinton County Reassessment Board, CLINTON COUNTY REASSESSMENT APPEALS, 2008 *2014-15 - Centre County - 44.4700 mills, Clinton County - 12.2200 mills, Potter County - 38.0900 mills. *2013-14 - Centre County - 43.5900 mills, Clinton County - 11.9100 mills, Potter County - 36.6400 mills. *2012-13 - Centre County - 43.6200 mills, Clinton County - 11.9200 mills, Potter County - 36.6400 mills. *2011-12 - Centre County - 40.2400 mills, Clinton County - 11.23 mills, Potter County - 36.2800 mills. *2010-11 - Centre County - 40.2400 mills, Clinton County - 11.23 mills, Potter County - 36.2800 mills. *2009-10 - Centre County - 37.3700 mills, Clinton County - 10.8300 mills, Potter County - 37.9500 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Pennsylvania School District Finances_Real Estate Tax Rates_0910, 2009 *2008-09 - Centre County - 36.1200 mills, Clinton County 53.3500 mills, Potter County - 38.0400 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Pennsylvania School District Real Estate Tax Rates 2008-09, 2008 *2007-08 - Centre County - 34.3300 mills, Clinton County 53.3500 mills, Potter County - 39.9700 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2008 *2006-07 - Centre County - 34.3800 mills, Clinton County 53.3500 mills, Potter County - 40.6300 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2006 *2005-06 - Centre County - 34.7300 mills, Clinton County 51.9000 mills, Potter County - 38.7200 mills.

Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011-2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but it can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increasing rising health care costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.Pennsylvania Department of Education 2010-11 Act 1 of 2006 Referendum Exception Guidelines. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six of the ten exceptions to the Act 1 Index. Several exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate.

It has the same ultimate source material as the 1948 film of the same name (and some other films), but differs in some significant respects. In the series, Audie Murphy stars as Tom \\"Whispering\\" Smith, a 19th-century police detective in Denver, Colorado. Filming of the series began in 1959, but the program did not air until May 8, 1961, because of unexpected production problems. Whispering Smith combines elements of CBS's Have Gun - Will Travel starring Richard Boone, NBC's Tales of Wells Fargo starring Dale Robertson, the syndicated Shotgun Slade with Scott Brady, and ABC's The Man From Blackhawk, a Stirling Silliphant production starring Robert Rockwell. While the Western setting of the series is unique, it is otherwise a standard detective program. Program background The 1948 film was about a railroad policeman named Luke \\"Whispering\\" Smith in frontier-era Wyoming, pursuing a gang of train robbers loosely modeled on the Hole in the Wall Gang. It was based on a novel by Frank H. Spearman. The character in the novel and the subsequent film combined elements of real-life railroad detectives Joe Lefors, who was employed by the Burlington line, and Timothy Keliher of the Union Pacific. By contrast, the character on the TV series, whose first name is slightly different, does not seem based on any real-life figure, and neither are the other characters. The series is clearly set sometime after 1874. when Denver's local law enforcement agency transitioned from a town marshal's office to a city police force. Some episodes of the show were said to be based on actual cases from the files of the Denver Police Department. In the 1948 film Whispering Smith, Alan Ladd starred as the no-nonsense railroad investigator assigned to solve the mystery of a rash of train robberies. He sadly finds that the perpetrator of the crimes is an old friend, Murray Sinclaire, portrayed by Robert Preston. The 1948 film was not the first motion picture to have been based on Spearman's railroad detective. In fact, there were three silent films based on Spearman's novel, in 1916, 1926, and 1927. A sound picture set in modern times, Whispering Smith Speaks, was released in 1935, though, in that film, the titular character was a railroad track walker rather than a detective, who solves a crime on the side. In the first of the silent films, Harold Lloyd served as an assistant director, while the director, J. P. McGowan, also played the lead. In 1951, the film, Whispering Smith Hits London, also set in modern times, starred Richard Carlson as an American detective working on a special case at Scotland Yard in England. Controversy and Conclusion After seven episodes of the series were filmed, co-star Guy Mitchell, a recording artist who portrayed detective George Romack, broke his shoulder in a fall from a horse. By the time he recovered, Murphy had a film commitment (Hell Bent for Leather, shot August 17 ‚Äì September 11, 1959) and production had to be further postponed. Actor Sam Buffington, costarring as police chief John Richards, committed suicide at the age of twenty-eight, and had to be replaced. Once scheduled, the series missed its intended debut date because of an NBC news special.Gossett, p. 176. After the premiere of Whispering Smith, the U.S. Senate Juvenile Delinquency subcommittee claimed that the series was excessively violent, and Murphy rushed to its defense. A hearing before the subcommittee made the front page of The New York Times on June 9, 1961. With the lights dimmed in their meeting room, members of the subcommittee watched the second episode, \\"The Grudge\\". They saw a story of bloody revenge that included the following: a fistfight, a mother horsewhipping her son, a claim of sexual assault (fabricated) in a hotel room, a story told of a man laughing after shooting another man six times in the stomach, a gunfight ending in injury, and the same mother, at the end, accidentally shooting and killing her daughter instead of the target (Smith/Murphy). The story was set in Denver, Colorado and when the lights came up Senator John A. Carroll of Colorado called the episode \\"a libel on Denver\\". An executive producer for Revue Studios defended the program before skeptical senators. The committee staff estimated that 2,500,000 children had watched \\"The Grudge\\".\\"Delinquency Rise Laid to TV Shows\\", The New York Times, June 9, 1961, p.1. The program was soon discontinued, as Murphy himself lost interest in the project. Twenty Whispering Smith episodes aired through September 18, 1961, in the time slot following Tales of Wells Fargo. The remaining six segments were never broadcast on NBC. Whispering Smith aired at 9 p.m. Mondays opposite the CBS sitcom The Danny Thomas Show and the second half of the ABC modern detective series Surfside 6. The budget was $45,000 an episode.Don Graham, No Name on the Bullet: The Biography of Audie Murphy, Penguin, 1989 p 284 Cast *Audie Murphy as Tom \\"Whispering\\" Smith *Guy Mitchell as George Romack *Sam Buffington as John Richards Notable guests Among current and future stars who appeared on Whispering Smith were *Robert Redford and Gloria Talbott as Johnny and Cora Gates in \\"The Grudge\\", the second episode of the series *Harry Carey, Jr. as Sergeant Stringer in \\"Safety Valve\\" *Richard Chamberlain as Chris Harrington in \\"Stain of Justice\\" *James Best in starring role in \\"The Hemp Reeger Case\\" *Edward Platt in \\"The Hemp Reeger Case\\" *Roscoe Ates (1895‚Äì1962), formerly of the 1950 western The Marshal of Gunsight Pass, as a sheriff in the episode entitled \\"Three for One\\" *Clu Gulager, later co- star of The Tall Man and The Virginian, as Jeff Whalen in \\"The Devil's Share\\" *Myron Healey as Jim Conley in \\"Double Edge\\" *Don Keefer as Dr. Johnson in \\"The Deadliest Weapon\\" *Read Morgan as Hob Tyler in \\"The Jodie Tyler Story\\" *Forrest Tucker, later star of the western sitcom F Troop, as Gunman Bardot in \\"Trademark\\" *Elen Willard, as Charlotte Laughlin in \\"The Quest\\" *Alan Hale, Jr., who starred in the western series Casey Jones, appeared in the series finale, \\"The Idol\\", as Ole Brindessen, the witness to a swindler who commits murder *Jim Davis of Dallas fame appears in \\"Homeless Wind\\" Episodes { class=wikitable style=\\"background:#FFFFFF\\" - style=\\"color:#FFFFFF\\" ! style=\\"background:#515151; width:20px\\" N¬∫ ! style=\\"background:#515151\\" Title ! style=\\"background:#515151; width:135px\\" Original air date } DVD release Timeless Media Group released 25 episodes of this series in a 3-disc Region 1 set on April 20, 2010.

It stars Ken Foree. Plot In 1986, in Chernobyl, a mass grave of bodies is discovered, resembling victims of the Plague. The Chief of Bureau (Eugeni Roig) arrives at the scene and is informed that a man cut himself on a corpse‚Äôs ribcage and died of infection minutes after. Seconds later, that same man rises up and attacks them both. Twenty years later, a local professor (Steve Agnew) is trying to catch a train out of Pancevo, Serbia, but finds that all railroads have been closed down as part of a military exercise. While he tries to make a call, a train comes in carrying a deadly biohazard agent monitored by a scientist in a hazmat suit, who asks for permission to pass through. Before he can, a trio of drunken off-duty soldiers emerge and harass the station guard, taking his weapon and inadvertently rupturing the tank, releasing the chemical agent into the atmosphere. All the soldiers and the station guard are infected by the gas, becoming zombies, but the professor manages to escape. Meanwhile, INTERPOL Agent, Mina Milieus (Kristina Klebe) is tasked with transporting a mysterious prisoner (Emilio Roso) from Serbia to Belgrave while under the supervision of Agent Mortimer ‚ÄúMorty‚Äù Reyes (Ken Foree), an ex-CIA agent and on the verge of retiring, along with his partner, Inspector Dragan ‚ÄúDra‚Äù Belic (Miodrag Krstovic). While Mina is in awe of Morty, she is also nervous as this is her first assignment in the field. Morty assures her that she will be fine, considering this to be the easiest assignment he‚Äôs ever had. The Chief of Bureau meets with the President and informs him about the accident at the train station in Pancevo. He discloses that the agent in the tank was capable of reanimating dead cells and advises that he not bother with evacuation, but contain the incident and let the National Guard deal with the rest. Back in Pancevo, a young reporter named Jan (Marko Janjic) is wasting his time at a minor concert, and is eventually convinced by his girlfriend Angela (Ariadna Cabrol) to leave along with her friend, Jovana (Iskra Brajovic). At the same time, the professor is trying to escape the growing number of infected. He comes across another escaped felon, Armageddon (Vukota Brajovic), who states the End of Days has arrived, and he has made it his personal mission to eradicate the zombies. The professor runs away and meets Jan and the girls, who allow him to come into their car. The two INTERPOL vans arrive in Pancevo just as the driver, Petrovic, hits a zombie. When they go out to investigate, several more arrive, separating them from Agents Bottin (Vahidin Prelic) and Savini (Zeljko Sesta). They attempt to contact Headquarters for backup, but there is no signal. Upon finding the second van, containing the Prisoner, Morty finds Bottin and Savini are dead with more zombies coming. The Prisoner tells them to shoot the zombies in the head, which proves to be successful, but they are quickly overwhelmed: Petrovic is devoured and Dra is bitten on the hand. With little choice, they are forced to take shelter in a nearby abandoned police station. While reconnoitering the area, Morty and Dra find the professor, Jan and the girls, and bring them back to the reception. The Prisoner attempts to flirt with Mina, but she rebuffs him, although she is put off by how he knew she was a rookie. Meanwhile, Armageddon continues his rampage on the zombies, using multiple weapons at his disposal. He enters a local TV Station and broadcasts his declaration of the apocalypse to Pancevo, including the station. Realizing the gravity of the situation, Morty decides to activate the generator and find a way out. Dra is unable to come with him and has begun to succumb to infection, resulting in Morty freeing the Prisoner and taking him along. After turning the power on, several zombies break in and nearly kill Morty, but the Prisoner saves him. Dra subsequently dies and reanimates, forcing Mina to shoot him. Jovana, driven insane by the turn of events, breaks down the barricade, allowing herself to be eaten. The professor also chooses death by Morty‚Äôs gun, as opposed to being eaten. The group escapes and heads towards the river through the train tunnels. The Prisoner reveals to Mina that he knows of the zombies because his father was one of them, as a result of the incident in Chernobyl. He goes on to explain the President will most likely ‚Äòcleanse‚Äô the city to prevent the spread of infection. Upon arriving at the shipyards, they find a horde of sleeping zombies which are awoken by the Hazmat zombie. Morty leads the zombies away while the rest of the group makes for the boat. Morty runs out of ammo and gets trapped inside a train, while Jan takes the boat and abandons Angela. Just as she is about to be eaten, Armageddon arrives and supplies the group with weapons; Mina with a rifle, and the Prisoner with a broadsword. The three proceed to kill the zombies, while Morty escapes the train, taking a gun from the Prisoner and helping them out. Armageddon finishes off the undead and the Prisoner decapitates the Hazmat zombie, apparently ending the threat. Later, the President announces that he will cooperating with NATO to bring all those responsible for the bioweapon to justice, much to The Chief of Bureau‚Äôs chagrin. The President considers his decision to be ‚Äúa necessary evil‚Äù and expects the Chief to resign, effective immediately. Mina allows the Prisoner to leave, despite having some ammo in her guns, showing respect for him. Morty congratulates her on her efforts, in spite of the mission not being completed, saying he messed up his first one as well. Milo asks who the Prisoner was, to which Morty replies: ‚ÄúNobody special.‚Äù As they leave, Armageddon completes his prophesy, possibly answering Mina‚Äôs question: ‚ÄúAnd he shall raise his hands with the Sword of Vengeance. The Flaming Blade of the Lord‚Äôs Retribution. And his eyes were as a flame of fire‚Ä¶ And he had a name written‚Ä¶ which no man knoweth but himself.‚Äù In the final scene, Jan has taken the boat up the river, only for it to run out of gas. As he heads to a cabin to look for more, the infected captain lurches out and tackles them both into the river. CastRelease The film was released on February 22, 2009.

Yuriy Meshkov served as the only President of Crimea from 1994 to 1995. Eleven days after his first return to Crimea since 1995, Meshkov was deported from Ukraine on July 13, 2011 with the restriction of entry for 5 years. Biography Yuri Meshkov was born on October 25, 1945 in SynelnykoveMeshkov Comments on Kiev, Moscow Talks, Vremya (MN) (February 1994) in the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (now Ukraine) to a Ukrainian-born mother and a native Kuban Cossack Russian father. He grew up in Simferopol where he finished high school. When he was about eight years old the region of Crimea was officially transferred from the Russian SFSR to the Ukrainian SSR. For his military obligation he served in the Border Guard. In 1967 (in some sources 1977) he graduated from the Law School of Moscow State University. Until 1982 he worked as a detective and then as the head detective in the office of the District's Attorney. From 1982 to 1985 he spent time on the science-researching yacht Skif. After 1985 and until 1990 worked privately as a judicial consultant. At that time he also was one of the leaders of the Crimea department of the All- Union historical-enlighting society \\"Memorial\\", and the president of the Crimean Federation of kickboxing. In 1990, Meshkov was elected as a deputy to the Supreme Council of Crimea (the republic's parliament). There he became the co-founder of the RDK Party (Republican movement of Crimea). In 1994 he stood at the helm of the electoral bloc \\"Russia\\" for the republican presidential elections where he easily defeated in the second round of elections Mykola Bahrov who ran as the independent. Mykola Bahrov at that time was the head of the Supreme Council of Crimea. During the second round of the 1994 Crimean presidential elections, Meshkov won with 72.9 percent and elected as the republic's only president.Bohlen, Celestine (March 23, 1994). Russia vs. Ukraine: A Case of the Crimean Jitters. New York Times His main political platform was to facilitate much closer relationships with the Russian Federation up to the possible reunification of Crimea with Russia. Meshkov tried to initiate a military-political union with Russia and completely disregarded the stances of the Ukrainian government. He also tried to force the rotation of the Russian ruble, issue Russian passports to the Crimean population, and even transfer Crimea to the same time zone as Moscow. Due to the unforeseen resistance from the local opposition, Meshkov only managed in putting his autonomous republic into Moscow time zone. He also appointed the vice prime-minister, the Russian economist Yevgeny Saburov, who virtually became the head of the government. He then argued when was confronted by other government officials regarding the legitimacy of his appointee who did not even possess a Ukrainian passport. Due to that Yevgeny Saburov was forced to resign. After that he managed to paralyze the work of the Supreme Council of Crimea. In 1995, the Ukrainian parliament scrapped the Crimean Constitution and abolished the post of president on March 17, 1995.Staff report (March 19, 1995).

After Ukrainian special forces had entered Meshkov's residence and disarmed his bodyguards Meshkov was put on a plane to Moscow (Russia). In Moscow he taught at the Moscow university. He did not return to Crimea till 2 July 2011 because his ex-wife (Lyudmyla) had died (on 28 May 2011). –í –°–∏–º—Ñ–µ—Ä–æ–ø–æ–ª–µ –ø–æ–≥–∏–±–ª–∞ –∂–µ–Ω–∞ –ø—Ä–µ–∑–∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ç–∞ –†–µ—Å–ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–∏ –ö—Ä—ã–º (–í–ò–î–ï–û) –ê–∫—Ç–∏–≤–∏—Å—Ç–∫–∞ —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –¥–≤–∏–∂–µ–Ω–∏—è –≤—ã–ø–∞–ª–∞ –∏–∑ –æ–∫–Ω–∞ In Simferopol, the president's wife died of the ARC (VIDEO) Russian activist movement fell out of the window, (28 May 2011) At a 7 July 2011 press conference, he called for a referendum on restoring the Constitution of Crimea 1992 version, which actually declared Crimea a sovereign state.

The event was organised by Michael Gudinski, Michael Chugg, Amanda Pelman, Joe Segreto & Tom Lang of IMC/Homebake Festival and Mark Pope to raise funds for those affected by the February 2009 Victorian bushfires. The event was held simultaneously at the Melbourne Cricket Ground and the Sydney Cricket Ground. All the proceeds from the Melbourne Concert and half of the proceeds of the Sydney Concert went to the Red Cross Victorian Bushfire Appeal. The other half of the Sydney proceeds went to the Queensland Premier's Disaster Relief Appeal to help flood victims. A special presentation was held midway through the concerts, with a satellite link between the two venues. At this time, Kylie Minogue, at the Melbourne event, performed \\"I Still Call Australia Home\\" and Australian actress Toni Collette introducing Princes William and Harry who sent their support via satellite. The Princes' speech at Sound Relief was their first ever to the nation and as such, made Australian Constitutional history. Jet and Wolfmother flew interstate to play at both concerts. Hunters & Collectors reunited for the first time in over 10 years for the concert. The finale of the show was Midnight Oil who had reformed to perform on the Melbourne stage at the MCG. Lead singer Peter Garrett, was then also Australia's Minister for Environment and the Arts. Some members of Crowded House made a surprise appearance with Liam Finn to perform three of their hits. Kings of Leon chose not to perform their popular No. 1 hit, Sex on Fire, out of respect for the bushfire victims. Footage was released on DVD on 9 October.

Once he made it back to the stage he then repeated the end of the song, but was so exhausted that he let the crowd sing the final line. He was then unwell after the performance and spent the afternoon vomiting, still managing to play a second show that night. Eskimo Joe, Wolfmother and Jet all premiered new songs that had not been released yet. Eskimo Joe sung \\"Foreign Land\\" and \\"Inshalla\\", Wolfmother sang \\"Back Round\\" and Jet sang \\"She's A Genius\\". Little Birdy sang \\"Six Months in a Leaky Boat\\" in Sydney and Split Enz would sing it at Melbourne later that night. While Jet and Wolfmother played most of their songs at both concerts, this was the only song to be played at both concerts by two separate artists. Australian actress Toni Collette introduced Princes William and Harry who sent their support via satellite. The Presets performed parts of their song during the middle of a lightning storm. Media coverage On television, the Sydney concert was broadcast on XYZnetworks-owned pay TV music channel MAX, with the Melbourne concert was broadcast on sister channel Channel [V]. On radio, the ABC's youth radio network Triple J produced a feed syndicated to commercial radio networks for free, with acts from both concerts produced by the station's live music team. Aside from the station itself, the feed was aired on the Austereo-owned Triple M Network, the Macquarie Regional RadioWorks- owned LocalWorks network, and the DMG Radio Australia-owned Nova and Vega networks.

His research focuses in the philosophy of psychology. He also works in both the philosophy of mind, and philosophy of biology. Background Shapiro graduated summa cum laude from Dickinson College in 1984, earning entry into the Phi Beta Kappa Society. He received his Ph.D in philosophy from the University of Pennsylvania in 1992. Shapiro married Athena Skaleris, a lawyer and together they moved to Madison, Wisconsin. They have two daughters, Sophia and Thalia. He has published a number of articles in top-tier philosophy journals. He is also the author of The Mind Incarnate (MIT:2004), which challenges the widespread assumption that mental states can be 'realized' in a variety of different substances. Shapiro's argument has important consequences for a range of philosophical positions about the mind, including the functionalist analysis of mental states. He has also co-edited, with Brie Gertler, Arguing About the Mind, a book of readings in the philosophy of mind. He published a book on embodied cognition called Embodied Cognition,Shapiro, Lawrence A. Embodied Cognition. New York: Routledge, 2011. Print.

He also came up with many product names, including the Esquire, the Telecaster, the Stratocaster, and the Champ. He was Leo Fender‚Äôs partner and the sales, distribution, marketing and advertising behind the company‚Äôs rise from small California guitar maker to worldwide status. Biography Donald Dean Randall was born in Kendrick, Idaho, on Oct. 30, 1917, to Earnest and Osie Violet Randall. The family moved to California when Randall was 10 years old, and he developed an interest in radios and audio amplifiers while still in high school (he earned his ham radio operator license at age 16 in 1934). At the height of the Big Band era, Randall built a portable amplifier and speaker system that he set up at parties and dances. He graduated from Santa Ana Community College. Around 1940, Randall worked part-time as a salesman for Santa Ana, California radio supply shop, Howard Taylor Wholesale Radio, calling on Southern California radio shops, including Clarence ‚ÄúLeo‚Äù Fender‚Äôs shop in Fullerton, California, Fender Radio Service. Randall and Fender met shortly before the United States entered World War II; Randall had bought Taylor‚Äôs store in 1941 but sold his inventory on being drafted into the Army. During the war, Randall served in the Army Corps of Engineers, the Army Signal Corps and the Army Air Corps, becoming communications chief of the pre-flight school near Santa Ana Randall was an avid lifelong aviator who received his pilot‚Äôs license in the early 1950s and logged thousands of flight hours in his own aircraft. Randall left the Army in 1946 and immediately re-entered the radio business, managing Francis ‚ÄúF.C.‚Äù Hall‚Äôs Santa Ana radio shop, Radio-Tel. A natural salesman and an astute electrical engineer, Randall suggested that Hall distribute the steel guitars and amplifiers made by Leo Fender. Through Randall, Fender and Hall signed an agreement that March, marking the beginning of an extraordinarily successful partnership. Through Hall‚Äôs agency, Randall handled sales and distribution of Fender products first regionally, then nationally. Indeed, the fledgling Fender company owed its early success as much to Randall‚Äôs skilled sales organization as it did to its founder‚Äôs innovative products. Randall became president of new organization Fender Sales in February 1953 (the Fender Electric Instrument Company having become a corporation in December 1951). Under Randall‚Äôs marketing genius, organizational expertise and senior partnership with Leo Fender, Fender Sales grew steadily throughout the 1950s and thrived well into the 1960s on an international scale. It was he who coined the names Esquire, Telecaster (and its earlier incarnation, the Broadcaster), Stratocaster, Precision Bass (with Leo Fender), Twin Reverb, Bassman and others.

The Youth Front was created for the framing and political indoctrination of the young Spaniards according to the principles of the so-called Movimiento Nacional, the conglomeration of political and social forces that supported the Military Uprising against the II Republic, which would give rise to the civil war with which Franco took power. Prior to its creation, there had been a series of youth organizations of the parties that supported the Uprising, especially the \\"Pelayos\\", traditionalism youths, and the \\"Balillas\\", first name of the Spanish Falange youth organization and de las JONS, which was renamed Youth Organizations following the Unification Decree of 1937 and whose second and last Delegate was, until 1940, Sancho D√°vila; these organizations were dissolved and integrated in the Youth Front to the creation of this.Law of creation of the Frente de Juventudes (1940) With the evolution of Francoism, the Youth Front was adapting its aims and its composition to the political vicissitudes of the Regime; in November 1961 the denomination of Youth Front was changed to that of National Delegation of Youth, much less belligerent: and in January 1970, a major reorganization of the General Secretary of the Movement, the highest organ political regime, changes its name to National Delegation of Youth, with which it reaches the end of the Regime, in 1977.  Institutional purposes  The aims of the Youth Front are clearly stated in its Foundational Law, and were addressed to the entire Spanish youth, both those affiliated voluntarily, and, and here lies the singularity of the Front and its influence on Spanish society at the time, the unaffiliated, who received the denomination of \\"framed\\" and were divided into \\"schoolchildren\\" (of all educational levels), \\"apprentices\\" (workers), and \\"rural\\" (peasants). For affiliated youth, the purposes were the following (Article 7 of the Law): a) Political education, in the spirit and doctrine of the Movement. b) Physical and sports education. c) Pre-military education. d) Initiation to the Home female youth. e) Collaborate in the cultural, moral and social formation with the institutions to which they belong and provide religious education proper to the Church. f) Organize and direct camps, colonies, shelters, courses, academies and any other work of this kind, directed to the fulfillment of its functions. g) Complete, with respect to its affiliates, the work of the State, mainly in matters of health, education and work. With regard to unaffiliated youth, the purposes were the following (Article 8): a) Political initiation. b) Physical education. c) The organization of how many summer colonies or similar institutions are subsidized by public Corporations and the inspection of those organized by private entities. d) The monitoring of compliance with the slogans of the Movement, as far as youth is concerned, in education and work centers.  Organization and structure  For the best fulfillment of the competences attributed to the Youth Front, this was structured through different bodies, some of a personal nature and others, collective. At the head of the Delegation was the National Delegate of the Youth Front, freely appointed by the National Chief of the Traditionalist Spanish Falange and of the National Syndicalist Movement Offensive Board, Francisco Franco, at the proposal of the Secretary General, on which he depended hierarchically, as stated in article 11 of the founding law. Nothing says in the legal text on the removal of the Delegate, but the Statute of the Movement, in article 23 determines that at the head of each service there will be a Delegate, \\"appointed and dismissed freely by the National Chief\\". The organization was structured through services or departments to which they should develop the tasks entrusted. This structure was not stable and permanent, but, although it suffered several modifications, always maintained the foundational purposes. Military authorities visiting the Youth Front camp in Orio, Gipuzkoa. The founding law pointed to the existence of a physical education advisor and another of religion, whose first holders were Lieutenant General Joaqu√≠n Agulla and Jim√©nez-Coronado, and the Patriarch Leopoldo Eijo y Garay, respectively. Within the organization there were several units, as it was, especially in the first moments, the University Spanish Union (SEU), which attended the youth of higher education. Then there were the central Sections of Teaching, which competed everything related to the teaching activity that the Youth Front had entrusted; also everything related to the teaching staff of the National Spirit and Physical Education, as well as everything related to the textbooks of those subjects. The one of Work Centers attended to the working youth. One of the means employed was the so-called \\"Teaching Evenings\\", time that the companies gave to the Youth Front so that the apprentices could attend the activities and classes that the organization taught. Later, the \\"Vocational Training Competitions\\" began, which reached an international level. There was also a Rural Section that catered to peasant youth. The Organic Standard of 1962 refers to the Section of Professional Activities, with two aspects: the Agricultural Training Work and the Vocational Training. The founding law provided for the creation of the Naval and Air Sections. This last one did not come into existence and as for the Naval it had as its aim \\"the formation of young people who will normally do their military service in the navy, as well as those who aspire to exercise the professions of the navy or merchant, fishing fleet, and auxiliary services of the same.  Organization of affiliates  The voluntarily affiliated youth formed the Phalanges of Volunteers, later called Franco's Youth Falanges, which were organized into three groups or legions: Arrows (from 10 to 13 years old), Cadets (from 14 to 16 years old) and Guides (from 17 to 20 years old). The basic unit was the squadron, and the commands were called squad leader, phalanx, century and legion. The command of the Youth Front of the province corresponded to the provincial assistant. As more outstanding activities of the Youth Front were households, camps, marches and mountain schools stood out. In the 50s, the Youth Front was already clearly outdated, due mainly to his political and ideological component. This lag ends up leading to its dissolution. However, its sports and cultural component were still standing, leading in 1960 to the creation of the Spanish Youth Organization (OJE), which emerged as an independent youth association, devoid of political content and aimed at filling the free time for children and adolescents with their own educational project.  Services and activities  The services and activities developed by the Youth Front were very broad and numerous, covering, in addition to the educational field, free time, culture and even information. In the free time highlights were mainly tournaments and competitions of sports activities, camps and hostels, cultural and leisure activities such as theater, model airplanes, school health and companies such as BCB (Blue Chain of Broadcasting), the Travel Office TEET (Tourism, Exchange and Educational Trips), the Spanish Network of Youth Hostels, the Youth Bazaar Network, and the Editorial Doncel, through which he edited comics as Balal√≠n (1957-1959) and Trinca (1970-1973).Cuadrado (2000), pp. 103-104. In the more strictly educational field, the Youth Front came to have a network of primary schools and one of minor schools (secondary education in boarding school), in addition to having the exclusivity of organization, teaching and evaluation, at all levels of education, of various subjects, the so-called \\"disciplines of the Movement\\": physical education, political education (which received different names as the Regime developed) and, for girls, several subjects that together constituted the so-called \\"home teachings\\". Even the Official School of Journalism came to depend on Youth, before the creation of the Faculties of Information Sciences. The basic human support of the Youth Front was constituted by the Special Body of Instructor Officers trained in the Command Academy Jos√© Antonio of Madrid, graduated in physical education, civic-social training and camps.

The series recounts the early adventures of Kryptonian Clark Kent as he adjusts to life in the fictional town of Smallville, Kansas, during the years before he becomes Superman. The ninth season comprises 21 episodes and concluded its initial airing on May 14, 2010, marking the fourth season to air on The CW television network. After four seasons broadcasting on Thursday nights at 8:00 pm, Smallville was moved to Friday nights at 8:00 pm for season nine, to make room for The Vampire Diaries. This season Clark takes his superhero persona into obsessive territory when he leaves behind those he cares for so that he can focus solely on Jor-El's training. In order to accomplish this, Clark wears a new costume that sports his family crest on the chest. The theme of the season is about Clark finally embracing his alien heritage, while also being his darkest hour thus far. As a result, Clark's relationships with Chloe and Oliver suffered this season. Season nine also saw the introduction of more DC Comics characters, including multiple episode appearances for the Justice Society of America, as well as villain Metallo, and villainess Agent Amanda Waller and an appearance by the Wonder Twins. Following the end of season eight, Aaron Ashmore and Sam Witwer departed the series after both their characters were killed off. Regular cast members during season nine include Tom Welling, Allison Mack, Erica Durance, Cassidy Freeman, Justin Hartley, and Callum Blue. With the loss of two series regulars, producers had to look for a new primary villain for season nine. Executive producers Kelly Souders and Brian Peterson decided to use Zod, a character from the comics and Christopher Reeve Superman films. This version of Zod is younger than previous incarnations, including the short appearance he had on Smallville in season six, and goes by the title of \\"Major Zod\\". Original depictions list the character as \\"General Zod\\". The season premiere brought in 2.58 million viewers and outperformed any other show in the Friday 8:00 pm timeslot in over a year. Furthermore, \\"Absolute Justice\\", a two-hour episode featuring the Justice Society of America, aired on February 5, 2010. In an effort to clear up confusion, the Smallville writers announced on their Twitter page that they still consider the two-hour episode to be two separately produced episodes, but was aired and packaged on the season nine DVD as a single episode. Season nine averaged 2.38 million viewers, ranking #129 out of the 140 broadcast primetime shows. EpisodesProductionWriting= In an interview, Justin Hartley revealed that season nine would partially deal with Oliver having to battle his personal demons: \\"I think he is going to struggle with the things he has been afforded (as a result of) his powers. He has sacrificed things and done things that haunt him... It‚Äôs bad stuff. We need to get to the bottom of it.\\" Peterson stated that season would see Clark taking his \\"Red-Blue Blur\\" persona into obsessive territory: \\"He is trying a little too hard to be a hero, and is leaving the rest of his life behind.\\" Entertainment Weekly's Michael Ausiello revealed that this season would feature major developments to the Clark/Lois relationship, but also that Superman's \\"iconic 'S'\\" would be featured significantly throughout the season, including on Clark's chest. After an interview with Peterson, Ausiello stated that the theme for season nine revolved around \\"Clark's darkest hour\\"; there will be a love-triangle between Clark, Lois, and the Red-Blue Blur that will last for the season; tension will build between Chloe and Clark as the former realizes she is not satisfied just being a \\"sidekick\\"; and that the creative team is not \\"story-wise, approaching this season as Smallvilles last\\". A scene between Clark and Jor-El has been constructed for the premiere to explain why Clark has not learned to fly. Clark and Oliver's friendship also became tense thanks to Oliver's growing interest in rekindling his romantic relationship with Lois, Zod would bring multiple Kryptonians to Earth with him, and Jor-El would make a physical appearance on the show. In an interview following the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con International panel for Smallville, Souders and Peterson revealed that Clark would be training to take one-step closer to his ultimate destiny as Superman, and that Clark would be wearing a costume while performing his Red-Blue Blur duties. The pair explained that this season's theme is also about Clark \\"embracing the fact that he is an alien\\". That said, Souders has stated that she would not refer to Clark himself as \\"darker\\", because he is still \\"the Superman underneath it all that we all know and love\\". E! Online's Natalie Abrams revealed, following the Smallville panel, that Clark's suit would be black, with a silver Superman \\"S\\" on the front, as well a trench coat that doubles as a cape. Based on the information released at the panel, Abrams reports that the producers had a series finale prepared should this season be the last. Although it was initially stated that Tom Welling would direct two episodes, because of his responsibilities producing the new series Hellcats, he only directed one. Allison Mack will be directing one. =Characters= Making return appearances this season are Toyman, who last appeared in season eight's episode \\"Requiem\\", along with another appearance from Martian Manhunter. On November 6, 2009, it was reported that Serinda Swan would return as Zatanna for an early 2010 episode, titled \\"Warrior\\". The characters Victor Stone and Dinah Lance are set to return for the season finale; Victor Stone has not been seen since the season six episode \\"Justice\\", and Dinah Lance has not made an appearance since the season eight finale. Callum Blue was also cast in the series regular role of Zod. His character was first mentioned in season five, when Brainiac used Lex Luthor's body as a physical vessel for Zod's spirit to inhabit. In an interview, Peterson and executive producer Kelly Souders explained that this version of Zod will be different from the one who appeared in prior seasons. The execs classify this incarnation as \\"Major Zod\\", as opposed to his typical \\"General Zod\\" identifier and reveal that throughout season nine \\"the venomous side of Zod rises because he experiences a few key betrayals with our beloved characters\\". Zod will also be accompanied by Kryptonians Faora, his wife in the comics, and Basqat. On September 11, 2009, it was announced that Julian Sands was cast as Jor-El for the seventh episode of season nine, \\"Kandor\\". Until now, Jor-El has been a disembodied voice emanating from Clark's ship in season two, the Kawatche cave walls in season three and four, and then the Fortress of Solitude from season five onward. Annette O'Toole and Michael McKean will return to reprise their roles as Martha Kent and Perry White, respectively. O'Toole has not made an appearance since the season six finale, when her character left for the United States Senate, and McKean has not appeared since his first guest spot in season three. Both actors will appear in the penultimate episode of the season. Executive producer Brian Peterson reveals that White's reintroduction into the series will show him moving closer to his destiny as the Editor-in-Chief of the Daily Planet, as well as his first meeting with Lois Lane, while Martha and Clark's reunion will have an \\"unexpected surprise\\". Brian Austin Green was cast to portray Metallo for the first two episodes of this season, and made a third appearance in the seventeenth episode in the spring 2010. The executive producers also brought in DC Comics character Roulette, portrayed by Steph Song, In an interview Song revealed that she reviewed the character's comic book backstory beforehand, but that she wanted to make it known that the character has her own agenda in the episode. Clarifying, even though Roulette is sent after Oliver by someone else, she always stays \\"five steps ahead of everyone else\\". Roulette's famous tattoo, a dragon going up her leg and wrapping around her torso, will appear in the episode. Song stated that she spent three days in testing, where the creative team drew the tattoo onto her body and then took pictures of how it appeared before making a transfer with color. In addition, there will also be first appearances by the Wonder Twins and Green Arrow's sidekick Speedy. Peterson revealed that Smallville's version of Speedy will be the most recent incarnation, Mia Dearden, and is HIV-positive just like her comic book counterpart. Souders explains, \\"She has a sordid past and crosses paths with Oliver [Green Arrow] in some shady places [...] But he gives her hope.\\" The Wonder Twins, who first appeared in the Super Friends Saturday morning cartoons, will have their traditional abilities of being able to transform into various forms of water and animal life; there will also be a glimpse of the twins' blue monkey Gleek. Geoff Johns will return to write an episode featuring the Justice Society of America; he previously wrote the episode \\"Legion\\", which introduced the Legion of Super-Heroes in season eight. According to Johns, the Justice Society will be a team of superheroes who \\"started it all-like the Watchmen\\" and \\"come out of retirement to give 'the screwed-up guys of the next generation a needed smack down'\\". Michael Shanks, Brent Stait and Brittney Irvin will be portraying Carter Hall/Hawkman, Kent Nelson/Dr. Fate and Courtney Whitmore/Stargirl respectively in the two-hour episode. Shanks will wear the traditional Hawkman uniform, complete with strap-on wings and Hawkman's mace. Shanks spent time practicing his wirework for the flying scenes he would have to film while in full costume. One difference in the costume is the inclusion of a chest plate. According to Shanks, the costume designers added a chest plate to assist the flying harness they created. The chest plate and Hawkman's helmet were given a bronze color, as opposed to the more traditional \\"yellow/gold\\" color. Smallville's version of Hawkman uses the backstory that Carter Hall is a \\"reincarnated prince from a thousand years ago\\", and worked alongside a group of superheroes in the 1970s. Shanks states that the Justice Society arrives to provide some \\"tough love\\" to Clark and his superhero friends, who are reaching a point in their lives where they are trying to find their own destinies. Although they will not appear, Shanks points out that there are references to other Justice Society members throughout the episode. Shanks and Irvin will reprise their Hawkman and Stargirl roles for the season finale. On November 9, 2009, it was announced that Pam Grier was cast as Amanda Waller, a villainess from DC Comics, for \\"multiple episodes\\". Odessa Rae was cast as the villainess Siobhan McDougal, also known as Silver Banshee. Smallville's McDougal is characterized as a \\"vengeful spirit of a fallen Gaelic heroine\\". The tenth episode of season nine featured a \\"bad guy version\\" of Green Arrow, known as the \\"Dark Archer\\", played by Steve Bacic. Carlo Marks has been cast to play Steven Swift/Warrior Angel, a potential love interest for Chloe. On February 22, 2010, it was announced that Gil Bellows would portray the DC Comics villain Maxwell Lord in at least one episode this season, with the potential for more episodes. Reception The season nine premiere, \\"Savior\\", pulled in viewership ratings that were the lowest for an original episode in the entire history of the series at the time, with only 2.58 million viewers. Low viewership aside, The CW issued a statement noting that Smallville did outperform every previous show on the network in the Friday 8:00 pm time slot in a year. On January 29, 2010, Smallville returned after a two-month hiatus. Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly said the first hour of the episode \\"Absolute Justice\\" contained the \\"stand-out visual sequence\\" and thought the second hour was \\"more lumbering\\", with the big fight sequence toward the end \\"unsatisfying\\". Tucker stated, \\"For viewers who only know the Superman/boy mythos according to Smallville, it must have seemed strange to have most of the series' ongoing subplots put in storage for this week's two-hour edition. Then again, since the villain of this piece was a faux-hawked foe called the Icicle, frozen plotlines were inevitable.\\" When referring to \\"Warrior\\", he called Serinda Swan's portrayal of Zatanna \\"smart\\" and said her dialogue with Clark was \\"crisp\\" which made Lois‚Äô jealousy understandable. On March 4, 2010, after The CW announced that Smallville would be back for its tenth season, and it stated that Smallville improved the network's overall Friday performance in the 8:00 pm ‚Äì 9:00 pm time period by 67% among adults 18‚Äì34, 200% in men 18‚Äì34, 75% in adults 18‚Äì49, 183% in men 18‚Äì49 and 74% in total viewers. After more than a month of not airing repeats or new episodes, Smallville returned with a series low of 2.13 million viewers, with the episode \\"Escape\\" on April 2, 2010. The following two episodes dropped in overall viewership, creating series lows three weeks in a row.  Home media release  The complete ninth season of Smallville was released on September 7, 2010 in North America in both DVD and Blu-ray format. The DVD and Blu-ray box set were also released in region 2 and region 4 on October 25, 2010 and June 22, 2011, respectively. The box set included various special features, including episode commentary, a documentary on the Zod character titled \\"Kneel Before Zod\\", and a documentary on how the creative team brought the Justice League to Smallville called \\"Justice to All\\".Details from the back of the DVD box set.

Born a generation after Stradivarius and Guarnerius, with no direct link to the great tradition, violin making made an unlikely comeback in Cremona in the person of Lorenzo Storioni and his two followers, Giovanni Rota and Giovanni Battista Ceruti. Along with Giovanni Rota, G.B. Ceruti was a follower of Lorenzo Storioni. He was born just outside Cremona and did not take up violin making until about age 40. It is said that he was probably self-taught, and his change of profession may have come through his colleagues in the textile trade, Bergonzi brothers, Nicola and Carlo II nephews of Michel Angelo Bergonzi, who did make a few violins. Philip Kass states that Ceruti was sponsored by a nobleman, to the displeasure of the famous dealer and collector Count Cozio, who was promoting other makers, including Giovanni Battista Guadagnini and Giacomo Rivolta of Milan. Ceruti‚Äôs son Giuseppe and grandson Enrico carried on as the premier violin makers of Cremona until Enrico‚Äôs death in 1883. Ceruti Dynasty carried on the tradition from the times of Storioni. Italy endured many wars, and finding materials for makers, at times was very difficult.The Late Cremonese - by Erin Shrader STRINGS magazine In 1802, he left Cremona and at some point took over Storioni's workshop. He died in 1817, most likely from typhus.

She has been described as \\"the Verdian dramatic soprano par excellence, powerful, passionate in utterance, but dignified in manner and secure in tone and control\\".Porter (1998), in Grove, p. 549 Biography Teresa Stolz was born Tereza Stolzov√° (Tereza is sometimes seen in diminutive versions such as Teresina, Teresie or Terezie) in Kostelec nad Labem in the Austrian Empire in 1834. This is now in the Czech Republic. She studied under Josef Neruda then at the Prague Conservatoire under Giovanni Battista Gardigiani. She was expelled from the Conservatoire in October 1851 but continued her study with Vojtƒõch ƒåaboun. She moved to Trieste to be with her brother, and where she studied with Luigi Ricci (who had conducted the 1848 premiere of Giuseppe Verdi's Il corsaro\\"Federico Ricci\\" and \\"Luigi Ricci\\": biographies on belcantosociety.org and later became her brother-in-law). She made her debut in Tiflis in 1857 and also appeared in Odessa, Constantinople, Nice, Granada and other places. In 1864 she went to Italy, where she was a pupil of Francesco Lamperti in Milan. She made her European debut in Turin in 1864. She appeared regularly at La Scala, Milan, between 1865 and 1877. She created the role of Leonora in the revised version of Verdi's La forza del destino in Milan on 27 February 1869. Teresa Stolz as the title role of Aida, Parma, 1872 She was the first to sing the title role of Aida in Italy (La Scala, 8 February 1872; also its European premiere). Verdi did not attend the world premiere in Cairo the previous December, and considered the Milan performance, in which he was heavily involved at every stage, to be its real premiere. Stolz was also the soprano soloist at the premiere of Verdi's Requiem on 22 May 1874. She also appeared in the Requiem under Verdi's direction at the Royal Albert Hall in London in 1875. She reprised Aida under Verdi in Vienna in 1875 and in Paris in 1876. Other roles included the title roles in Donizetti's Lucrezia Borgia, Bellini's Norma, and Verdi's Giovanna d'Arco; Mathilde in Rossini's Guillaume Tell, Alice in Meyerbeer's Robert le diable, Amelia in Un ballo in maschera, Gilda in Rigoletto and Desdemona in Otello. Her career took her to such places such as Moscow, St Petersburg, Cairo, the major Italian opera houses, as well as Vienna, Paris and London. Private life She was the mistress and later the fianc√©e of the conductor and composer Angelo Mariani. That relationship ended around 1871 but there were a number of complicating factors that led up to it. Mariani had formerly been a good friend of Verdi's, but they parted company in 1871 after Mariani's indecision when he was asked by Verdi to conduct the premiere of Aida in Cairo. Stolz was accused of having an affair with Verdi, but whether this charge is true cannot be said with certainty. Verdi did spend an unusual amount of time working with her leading up to the Milan premiere of Aida in 1872.\\"Giuseppe Verdi, 1813-1901: Essays on Verdi's Life and Works\\" on italianoperachicago.com. Retrieved 22 September 2013 Mariani died of cancer in 1873. On 4 September 1875, a Florence newspaper, the Rivista indipendente, published the first of five articles with intimate details of her private life, and accused her of immoral relations with both the late Mariani and with Verdi. Group portrait at Verdi's house at Sant'Agata in 1900. upright=1.3 What can be said with confidence is that Stolz's break with Mariani came with the encouragement of both Verdi and his second wife Giuseppina Strepponi, the supposedly wronged party, who had herself previously referred in her letters to the \\"continual deception\\" of Stolz. It was a very complicated affair, made even more complicated by the publication of supposed letters by Strepponi which referred to \\"my dear friend Teresina ... who has always behaved as a faithful friend should\\". These letters are now known to be forgeries; and the exact truth of the matter has been debated ever since. Stolz became Verdi's companion after Strepponi's death in 1897, Giuseppe Verdi: Time Line on brebru.com/musicroom but whether this was platonic or romantic is not known. She died in Milan in 1902, the year after Verdi, and is buried there. A hall in Kostelec is named after her. Family She had identical twin elder sisters, Francesca (Fanny) and Ludmila (Lidia), both singers. They both lived openly with her former teacher, the conductor and composer Luigi Ricci, who married Ludmila, but maintained a relationship with Francesca. By Ludmila, Ricci had a daughter Adelaide (Lella) Ricci, who was also a singer. Lella (Teresa's niece) became pregnant (possibly to Bed≈ôich Smetana), but had an abortion and died as a result of complications, aged 21. By Francesca, Luigi Ricci had a son, also Luigi Ricci (Teresa's nephew), who was a conductor and composer. He inherited Teresa Stolz's estate, and changed his name to Luigi Ricci-Stolz. Her grand-nephew through a different part of the Stolz line was the composer Robert Stolz. References Notes Sources *Conati, Marcello; Mario Medici (eds.) (Trans.

Born in New South Wales, Scherf was working on his father's grazing property when he enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force in 1941. On graduating as a pilot, he was sent to the United Kingdom for service in the European theatre. Flying de Havilland Mosquitos with No. 418 Squadron RCAF, Scherf was credited with the destruction of 7¬Ω aircraft in the air and on the ground, and awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. Afterward, he was posted for duties with Headquarters Air Defence of Great Britain. He nevertheless returned occasionally to No. 418 Squadron and flew operational sorties with the unit, destroying a further 16 aircraft and earning two more decorations. By the end of the war, Scherf had achieved 14¬Ω aerial victories in 38 operational sorties. He was also credited with destroying nine aircraft on the ground, and with damaging seven others. Early life Scherf was born at Emmaville, New South Wales, on 17 May 1917, the son of Charles Henry Scherf, a grazier, and his Cornish wife Susan Jane (n√©e Curnow). An active sportsman, Scherf attended the local school where he obtained an Intermediate Certificate. In 1934, he enlisted in the Citizens Military Force and was allotted to the 12th Light Horse Regiment as a private. He rose to the rank of corporal, before taking his discharge in 1939. On 23 August 1939, Scherf married Florence Hope O'Hara in an Anglican ceremony at the Holy Trinity Church, Glen Innes; the couple would have a son and three daughters. By this time he was working as a grazier on his father's property. Second World War On 12 September 1941, Scherf enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force for service during the Second World War. Posted for flight training at No. 10 Empire Flight Training School, Temora, and later No. 6 Service Flying Training School, Mallala, he graduated as a pilot with an \\"above average\\" rating on 2 July 1942. Commissioned as a pilot officer on 17 September, Scherf embarked from Sydney bound for the United Kingdom the following month. Following a six- week voyage, he disembarked on 27 November and was attached to Royal Air Force training units for \\"advanced flying and operational training\\". He was promoted to flying officer during this time. On completion, Scherf was posted to No. 418 Squadron RCAF on 13 July 1943, flying the de Havilland Mosquito, on intruder (a.k.a. \\"ranger\\") operations over occupied Europe. The pilots and navigators of four Mosquito crews who successfully engaged the enemy on a recent sortie. In a period of eight minutes, the four teams destroyed seven Axis aircraft and badly damaged another. Scherf is third from left. In August 1943, Scherf commenced flying operational sorties against Axis airfields in France. On 15 September, he flew as an escort to a group of eight Lancaster bombers during a low level attack on the Dortmund-Ems Canal, Germany. He was promoted to acting flight lieutenant on 29 December. During this time, Scherf took part in several night operations and was credited with damaging a variety of targets as well as shooting down four German aircraft at night. Praised for his \\"exceptional keenness and ... courage\\", Scherf was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his night time exploits. The announcement and accompanying citation for the award was published in a supplement to the London Gazette on 4 April 1944. In late February 1944, Scherf took part in a sortie over Axis occupied territory with Squadron Leader Howie Clevelend; Scherf flew the leading aircraft of the two. The pair attacked an Axis airfield at St Yan, France, and successfully destroyed three aircraft on the ground. Soon after, the two pilots spotted a Heinkel He 111Z twin-fuselage glider tug towing two Gotha Go 242 gliders. Scherf and Clevelend attacked the party, with Clevelend firing first and destroying one of the gliders. Scherf then destroyed the second glider, before the pair assaulted the Heinkel. In the first pass, Scherf set the starboard engine ablaze while Clevelend hit the starboard side. Scherf made a second firing pass, before the Heinkel spiralled to the ground with three of its five engines on fire. This action was Scherf's final sortie of his tour. The pair were credited with shooting down three aircraft in this operation, with an additional three others damaged or destroyed on the ground. On 13 March 1944, Scherf was promoted to acting squadron leader and, with his operation tour at an end, was posted to Headquarters Air Defence of Great Britain as a controller of Intruder operations. By the time of this posting, Scherf had destroyed seven airborne or grounded German aircraft, with an additional shared victory. Despite his new position, Scherf's \\"impatient spirit was far from satisfied with a staff position\\", and he occasionally returned to No. 418 Squadron when he was off duty, taking part in operational sorties with the unit. On 5 April, Scherf joined the squadron in a sortie over Northern France. During the engagement, Scherf shot down two Axis aircraft in the air and damaged three more on the ground. For his actions on the two operations in February and April, Scherf was awarded a Bar to his Distinguished Flying Cross. The citation for the decoration was published in a supplement to the London Gazette on 12 May 1944, reading: BBC radio. On 2 and 16 May 1944, Scherf took part in two further daylight sorties with No. 418 Squadron into \\"well-defended areas far into Germany\\". Leading a section of Mosquito aircraft in action against Luftwaffe bases in the Baltic area and over northern Germany, Scherf was credited with shooting down six aircraft in aerial combat, and damaging an additional three on the ground over the two operations. Commended for his \\"great skill, enterprise and fearlessness\\", Scherf was awarded the Distinguished Service Order. The notification and accompanying citation for the decoration was published in a supplement to the London Gazette on 27 June 1944. Scherf embarked to return to Australia on 10 July 1944, arriving in Brisbane two months later. He was briefly posted to RAAF Station Sandgate, before moving to No. 5 Operational Training Unit, based at Williamtown, as chief flying instructor in October. He served in this position until late December, when he was posted for duties with RAAF Base Richmond and later RAAF Bradfield Park. On 11 April 1945, Scherf transferred to Royal Australian Air Force Reserve and returned to his home in Emmaville, thus ending his wartime service. By this time, Scherf had been officially credited with shooting down 14¬Ω Axis aircraft in aerial combat, as well as nine aircraft destroyed on the ground and a further seven damaged from a total of 38 operational sorties. Later life On 16 February 1946, Scherf attended an investiture ceremony at Government House, Sydney, where he was presented with his decorations by the Governor- General of Australia, Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester. Scherf was discharged from the Royal Australian Air Force Reserve on 1 July 1947. Scherf found it difficult to re-adjust to civilian life, and began to have nightmares about the Germans he had shot down and killed during the war. This led him to drink heavily. On 13 July 1949, Scherf was driving his car along the Inverell road approximately from Emmaville when he struck a tree and the vehicle overturned. He died from his injuries later that day. Survived by his wife, their three daughters and son, Scherf was buried in the local cemetery. Two RAAF P-51 Mustang fighters flew in formation over the cemetery as the funeral party arrived, followed by a Mosquito as Scherf's casket was lowered into the grave.

The regiment was involved in campaigns in North Africa, Syria‚ÄìLebanon, Salamaua‚ÄìLae, the Finisterre Ranges and Borneo. After training in Victoria, the regiment deployed to North Africa in late 1940. After being deployed in the defence of Mersa Matruh in Egypt in early 1941, the regiment took part in the fighting against the Vichy French in Syria and Lebanon, before undertaking garrison duties there. It returned to Australia in early 1942 following Japan's entry into the war, and in September 1943, a small group of artillerymen from the 2/4th parachuted with two short 25 Pounder guns in the airborne landing at Nadzab airstrip in New Guinea in support of the US Army's 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment. Later, the regiment took part in the 7th Division's advance through the Finisterre Range before returning to Australia in early 1944. Its final involvement in the war came around Balikpapan in 1945. After the war, the regiment was disbanded on 7 February 1946. History Raised on 7 May 1940, as part of the 7th Division at Caulfield Racecourse, in Melbourne, Victoria, the regiment was initially formed with two three-troop batteries: the 7th and 8th. Each battery consisted of three troops and four QF 18 pounders. The regiment's initial volunteers were drawn mainly from Victoria, with many having previously served in local Militia artillery units. Artillery guns were scarce at the time and training was completed at Puckapunyal, Victoria, using guns borrowed from other units. On 21 October 1940, still without its own guns, the regiment embarked from Port Melbourne bound for the Middle East. Disembarking at El Kantara, in Egypt, on the Suez Canal in November. Its next destination was Deir Suneid, Palestine, traveling by train, where it undertook training, before receiving some artillery guns in January 1941. After moving to Ikingi Maryut, Egypt, in mid-April it finally was equipped with 25-pounders, 18-pounders, and 4.5 inch howitzers. After Tobruk was placed under siege by Axis forces in April 1941, the regiment moved to the fortress at Mersa Matruh, Egypt, with four guns being deployed forward in an anti-tank role. In May, the regiment received new 25-pounders at Tel el Kebir, Egypt, from the 9th Division before the Allies launched the Syria‚ÄìLebanon Campaign and moved to Affula, Palestine. As part of the invasion of Syria and Lebanon held at the time by the Vichy French, the regiment supported the Australian 21st Brigade's advance along the coast. Crossing the border on 8 June, the 7th Battery, as part of the advance guard which overlooked the Litani River, fired the first artillery shots of the campaign, subsequently providing critical fire support which allowed a bridgehead to be secured. During the fighting that followed the regiment undertook anti-tank, direct- fire tasks, counter battery fire and came under enemy air and naval attack. At the conclusion of the campaign, the 2/4th remained in Syria undertaking garrison duty. During its time there the regiment was expanded to include a third battery, which was designated the 54th Battery. 2/4th gunner's aboard a C-47 prior to a combat jump over Nadzab, September 1943 As part of the transfer of Australian combat troops to the Pacific, the 2/4th was withdrawn from Syria in December 1941 and subsequently transported back to Australia to help bolster the garrison there following Japan's entry into the war. In May 1942, after a period of leave, the regiment concentrated around Caloundra, in Queensland, after which a long period of training for jungle warfare took place. During this time the regiment was warned out for possible deployment on a number of occasions, but was ultimately not required. Some personnel were detached for service in New Guinea around Milne Bay and with \\"Lilliput Force\\", but the regiment did not see action again until early September 1943 when the 54th Battery deployed a detachment of 31 artillerymen and two Short 25-pound artillery pieces to support the US 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment's airborne landing at Nadzab, as part of Allied efforts to capture Lae during the Salamaua‚ÄìLae campaign. Following the successful capture of Nadzab, the rest of the regiment was transported by air and supported the Australian 25th Brigade's advance on Lae, and then the Australian 7th Division's subsequent involvement in the Finisterre Range campaign, during which its fire played a significant role in the successful capture of Shaggy Ridge by the Australian infantry on 27 December. The regiment was withdrawn to Australia in February 1944 for rest and reorganisation. A period was spent at Strathpine, Queensland, and then later the regiment moved to the Atherton Tablelands where the 7th Division prepared for its final campaign of the war in Borneo. It was over a year before the regiment was deployed again, transiting through Morotai Island in June 1945 before supporting the division's landing at Balikpapan in July. Landing on the second day of the operation, the regiment operated in support of the Australian 18th Brigade. After a short campaign, the war came to an end in August 1945 and the demobilisation process began. Personnel were transferred from the unit for subsequent service, or were repatriated to Australia for discharge, before the regiment was finally returned to Australia for disbandment. This occurred on 7 February 1946, while the regiment was based at Chermside, in Brisbane. A total of 30 personnel from the regiment were killed in action during the war, or died while on active service.

The Heritage-Scape. 2008, page 293-4 History Apsara represent an important motif in the stone bas-reliefs of the Angkorian temples in Cambodia (8th‚Äì13th centuries AD), however all female images are not considered to be apsara. In harmony with the Indian association of dance with apsaras, Khmer female figures that are dancing or are poised to dance are considered apsara; female figures, depicted individually or in groups, who are standing still and facing forward in the manner of temple guardians or custodians are called devatas. Apsara dancers at the Bassac Theatre. In 1940s, Queen Sisowath Kossomak Nearirath Serey Vatthana, the wife of King Norodom Suramarit, was sent an invitation to visit the Sothearath primary school. While there she saw the school mistress prepare an inspirational angkor apsara dance performed by young school children in the paper apsara costume including Crown, Sampot and Flower, all referencing Apsara represented at Angkor Wat. The Queen got the idea to re-create the dance, which led her first granddaughter, Princess Norodom Buppha Devi, a daughter of Norodom Sihanouk, to become the first professional apsara dancer of the modern era. The Princess started practicing the dance at 5 years old and danced apsara for first time during King Norodom Sihanouk's tenure. In 1967, the fine‚Äìboned young princess, clad in silk and glittering jewels, performed beneath the stars on the open pavilion within the palace walls, accompanied by the royal dance troupe and the pinpeat orchestra. Selected by her grandmother, Queen Sisowath Kossomak, to become a dancer when she was only a baby. She toured the world as the principal dancer of the apsara role. Costume The costumes of the apsara role is based on the devatas as depicted on bas-relief of Angkor Wat. They wear a sampot sarabap, a type of silk brocade that is intricately pleated in the front. Apsara dancer in a pose. =Headdress= The headdress of the lead apsara has three points or tips, with two rows of spherical decorations like the apsara pictured at Angkor Wat. Headdress worn by the subordinate dancers commonly have three points and only one row of sphere decoration. These crowns often include garlands of artificial hair with ornate adornments. The five-points crowns are frequently absent in modern dance routines. =Accessories= This round decorative collar (red colored) is highly visible; found just below the neck, the collar is embellished with detailed gold-colored copper ornaments and beaded designs. The elaborate decorations is usually found gracefully decorated on two separate rows. Additional copper ornaments are found hanging below these rows, in the shape of difficult-to-describe warped spear tips, the largest of which is centralized. Dangling earrings, which are bound in bunches, traditionally stretch almost to the shoulder. These dangling earrings are mainly duplicated from the design of the 'krorsang' flower (a large spiny tree with sour fruit) and are preferred to the 'mete' (chili) flowers, which are held to be less beautiful. There are a total of four types of wrist jewelry: kong rak, patrum, kong ngor, and sanlek. The first is a truly beautiful diamond-like studded bracelet a fine and elegantly wrist jewel decorated in a tree branch-like fashion, the second is more of a spring-like coiled gold colored thick copper while the third type of bracelet (two sets are worn) are small round beaded orb/sphere bunches delicately connected to one another, the last bracelet is an intricate and well decorated thickly rounded jewel. Additionally an Apsara dancer may be found wearing a garland of jasmine. Two types of gold ankle jewelry are usually worn by the Apsara dancer, the first being kong tong chhuk the second kong ngor (or kong kravel). The sangvar is a loosely decorated band of beads worn crosswise. The golden flower is considered a body-decorating element, either worn on the waist or carried during the performance. It too is gold in color, and made of thin flexible copper. Prima Ballerinas In the Royal Ballet, a prima ballerina for the apsara role is considered. Starting with Princess Norodom Buppha Devi there have been many others since the dance's conception. Sin Sakkada is the current prima ballerina for the apsara role. *Mrs. Seng Sreymom (·û¢·üí·ûì·ûÄ·ûü·üí·ûö·û∏ ·ûü·üÅ·ûÑ ·ûü·üí·ûö·û∏·ûò·ûª·üÜ) *Mrs. Voan Savai (·û¢·üí·ûì·ûÄ·ûü·üí·ûö·û∏ ·ûú·üê·ûì ·ûü·û∂·ûú·üÉ ) *Mrs. Douch Thach (·û¢·üí·ûì·ûÄ·ûü·üí·ûö·û∏ ·ûå·ûª·ûÄ ·ûê·û∂·ûÖ ) *Mrs. Voan Savong( ·û¢·üí·ûì·ûÄ·ûü·üí·ûö·û∏ ·ûú·üê·ûì ·ûü·û∂·ûú·ûÑ·üí·ûü) *Mrs. Yim Devi (·û¢·üí·ûì·ûÄ·ûü·üí·ûö·û∏ ·ûô·ûπ·ûò ·ûë·üÅ·ûú·û∏) *Mrs. Mom Kanika (·û¢·üí·ûì·ûÄ·ûü·üí·ûö·û∏ ·ûò·üâ·ûò ·ûÄ·ûé·û∑·ûÄ·û∂·ûö ) *Mrs. Ok Phalla (·û¢·üí·ûì·ûÄ·ûü·üí·ûö·û∏ ·û¢·üä·ûª·ûÄ ·ûï·ûõ·üí·ûõ·û∂ ) *Mrs. Sok Sokhoeun (·û¢·üí·ûì·ûÄ·ûü·üí·ûö·û∏ ·ûü·ûª·ûÅ ·ûü·ûª·ûÅ·ûø·ûì) *Mrs. Chap Chamroeunmina (·û¢·üí·ûì·ûÄ·ûü·üí·ûö·û∏ ·ûÖ·û∂·ûî ·ûÖ·üÜ·ûö·ûæ·ûì·ûò·û∑·ûì·û∂) *Mrs. Chen Chansoda (·û¢·üí·ûì·ûÄ·ûü·üí·ûö·û∏ ·ûÖ·û∑·ûì·üí·ûè ·ûÖ·ûì·üí·ûë·ûü·ûª·ûä·û∂) *Mrs. Sin Sakkada (·ûÄ·ûâ·üí·ûâ·û∂ ·ûü·ûª·û∑·ûì ·ûü·ûÄ·üí·ûÄ·ûä·û∂) See also * Dance in Cambodia * Earth in Flower * Khmer Classical Dance * HRH Norodom Buppha Devi ReferencesExternal links *See images of Apsara in Flickr *Watch Apsara dance *Robam Moni Mekhala (PL) *Taniec Apsar ‚Äì rozrywka bog√≥w i kr√≥l√≥w (PL) Category:Cambodian dances ","title":"Apsara Dance"},{"id":"21697154","text":"Chad O'Shea (born December 18, 1972) is an American football coach and former player who is the wide receivers coach and passing game coordinator for the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League (NFL).

A point of contention was the management style of then-institute director Jorunn Bj√∏rgum, who was accused of being \\"highly authoritarian\\" by one of Nedkvitne's professor colleagues, and both sides accused each other of harassment. The case caused concern among other Norwegian professors and academics (including Jan Helge Solbakk, Henning Jakhelln, Bernt Hagtvet, Kristian Gundersen, Unni Wikan, Arne Johan Vetlesen, Anine Kierulf and Jan Fridthjof Bernt) that academic freedom was not respected by the university administration.http://www.uniforum.uio.no/nyheter/2009/02/uio-professorar- stottar-oppseiingstruga-kollega.html On March 11, 2009, it became known that Nedkvitne would bring the case to court with support from the Norwegian Association of Researchers.http://universitas.no/nyhet/53114/ The case commenced before Oslo City Court in January 2010.

History A 17th-century bottle This specific vinegar composition is said to have been used during black death epidemic of the medieval period, to prevent the catching of the plague.Rene-Maurice Gattefosse, Gattefosse‚Äôs Aromatherapy (CW Daniel Company, Ltd. First published in Paris, France in 1937 by Girardot & Cie.), 85-86. Similar herbal vinegars have been used as medicine since the time of Hippocrates. Early recipes for this vinegar called for a number of herbs to be added into a vinegar solution and left to steep for several days. The following vinegar recipe hung in the Museum of Paris in 1937, and is said to have been an original copy of the recipe posted on the walls of Marseilles during an episode of the plague: Plausible reasons for not contracting the plague was that the herbal concoction contained natural flea repellents, since the flea is the carrier for the plague bacillus, Yersinia pestis. Wormwood has properties similar to cedar as an insect repellent, as do aromatics such as sage, cloves, camphor, rosemary, and campanula. Meadowsweet, although known to contain salicylic acid, is mainly used to mask odors like decomposing bodies. Another plausible reason for its effectiveness may be the antimicrobial properties of its constituents. Scientists have found wormwood, meadowsweet, wild marjoram, sage, cloves, campanula, angelica, rosemary, horehound and camphor to have antimicrobial properties. Another recipe called for dried rosemary, dried sage flowers, dried lavender flowers, fresh rue, camphor dissolved in spirit, sliced garlic, bruised cloves, and distilled wine vinegar.Hopkins, The Scientific American Encyclopedia of Formulas, 1910, 878. Modern-day versions include various herbs that typically include sage, lavender, thyme, and rosemary, along with garlic. Additional herbs sometimes include rue, mint, and wormwood. It has become traditional to use four herbs in the recipe‚Äîone for each thief, though earlier recipes often have a dozen herbs or more. It is still sold in Provence. In Italy a mixture called \\"seven thieves vinegar\\" is sold as a smelling salt, though its ingredients appear to be the same as in four thieves mixtures.http://www.cooker.net/doc/3A7B645D81D2CFB5C12572EE004D745A Mythology The usual story declares that a group of thieves during a European plague outbreak were robbing the dead or the sick. When they were caught, they offered to exchange their secret recipe, which had allowed them to commit the robberies without catching the disease, in exchange for leniency. Another version says that the thieves had already been caught before the outbreak and their sentence had been to bury dead plague victims; to survive this punishment, they created the vinegar. The city in which this happened is usually said to be Marseille or Toulouse, and the time period can be given as anywhere between the 14th and 18th century depending on the storyteller.Legend of Four Thieves Vinegar An alternative theory says that \\"four thieves vinegar\\" could be a corruption of \\"Forthave's vinegar\\", a concoction sold and invented by one Richard Forthave. (Published in a brief article in The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.) Another source, the book Abr√©g√© de toute la m√©decine pratique (1741), seems to attribute its creation to George Bates, though Bates' own published recipe for antipestilential vinegar in his Pharmacopoeia Bateana does not specifically use the name 'thieves' or 'four thieves'.

On the day Anderson declared a mistrial (due to a deadlocked jury), a three judge panel from the Ninth Circuit ruled that due to Anderson's actions during the case his \\"impartiality might be questioned\\" and that the case should be expediently retried before another judge. In 2008, the Ninth Circuit overturned a trial Anderson presided over, ruling that Anderson should have disqualified himself due to his stock holdings in a corporation alleged to be a part of fraudulent business activities in the case.\\"Homestore CEO's fraud conviction overturned\\", Bob Egelko, San Francisco Chronicle, January 15, 2008 In a 2011 Los Angeles Times article,\\"Relief delayed for prisoners deemed wrongfully convicted\\", Carol J. Williams, Los Angeles Times, August 21, 2011 Anderson was criticized for extensive delays in reviewing writs of habeas corpus. In particular, Anderson is alleged to refuse to rule upon writs in which junior judicial officials have found merit to a finding in favor of prisoner release; three cases have \\"languished unattended\\" in \\"years-long inaction\\"--these three cases waiting five years or more for rulings from Anderson. Legal experts have said that the delays are \\"highly unusual\\" and critics have asserted that Anderson's handling of these cases is concerning and may warrant a misconduct inquiry.

Biography Carter was born in Kendal, Westmorland, the son of a builder, John Carter. Carter lived in London from the age of 21 and through adult education classes at the Westminster Institution, broadened his knowledge and outlook. His studies led him to advocate emigration and, in particular, emigration to New Zealand, as one means of relieving distress. Following his marriage to Jane Robieson in 1850, he left for New Zealand with his wife. In Wellington he quickly made a position for himself as a resourceful and enterprising contractor, among the works which he completed being harbour reclamation, seawalls, and the Wellington Provincial Buildings (1857). In 1853 he was elected to the committee of the Wairarapa Small Farms Association, an organisation responsible for the settlement of Greytown and Masterton. In 1867 his suggestion that the unsold lands should be used for educational purposes within the district led directly to the establishment of the Greytown and Masterton land trusts. Carter represented the Wairarapa in the Wellington Provincial Council from 1857 to 1864, and in the General Assembly (for Wairarapa) from 1859 to 1865. The settlement was named in his honour 'Carterville', these days called Carterton. Carter's business success permitted his early return to England in 1863 for a four-year interval and again for most of the latter part of his life. Between 1857 and 1863, by a series of purchases of small holdings, he had formed the East Taratahi or Parkvale estates. While overseas he kept in touch with Carterton, and his direct assistance to the borough library made it, by the mid-1880s, probably the best in the country outside the main centres. Carter died at Wellington on 22 July 1896, and was buried at Clareville Cemetery in Carterton. He bequeathed a significant book and pamphlet collection to The New Zealand Institute, and the residue of his estate went towards the erection of an astronomical observatory for Wellington ‚Äì the Carter Observatory.

Additionally, he has personally coached athletes to international medals, including Denise Lewis, Kelly Sotherton and Huang Zhihong.  Early career  Charles van Commenee was born in Amsterdam, Holland, the son of Otto (a heavy industry worker) and Ineke (a woman of Indo Eurasian heritage). He grew up in Osdorp, a borough of the city, and from an early age he was instilled with a strong work ethic.

Though this was a significant achievement for the veteran athlete, Van Commenee said that he was as much a personal mentor for Huang as he was a coach. She had moved away from home to attend a sports institute at the age of twelve and had not experienced life outside of the centre. Van Commenee had helped her adapt to living on her own and supporting herself, at the same time as he helped her to a World Championship medal.Turnbull, Simon (2008-09-07).

The coach showed his stubborn and determined temperament when in 1996 he withdrew from managing the Dutch Olympic team because he felt that one of his trainees, Sharon Jaklofsky, was receiving unfair treatment. His trip to the 1996 Atlanta Olympics was self-funded and he took Jaklofsky out of the Dutch camp for training every day. She reached the finals of the competition but faulted three times, failing to record a mark.  British coaching  Van Commenee first met British heptathlon athlete Denise Lewis in 1994 at an athletics meeting in Valladolid, Spain. Her coach Darrell Bunn could not attend the meeting and Van Commenee was asked to help her through the event. Impressed with his work, Lewis moved to Amsterdam to train with Van Commenee in 1997. The pairing was fruitful for both athlete and coach; under the supervision of Van Commenee, Lewis went on become heptathlon champion at both the Commonwealth Games and European Championships in 1998 and won silver at the 1999 World Championships.Knight, Tom (2001-01-13).

At the 2000 Sydney Olympics she took the gold in the heptathlon, becoming the first of Van Commenee's charges to win an Olympic gold medal. However, her victory was not easily forthcoming; during the Olympic events Van Commenee was critical of her performances, urging her ever more to try harder. Despite the fact that Lewis was suffering injuries, she managed to win the event. She put much of her success and drive to win down to the fact that Van Commenee had been so strict: Van Commenee also worked with less prominent athletes, helping them improve their performances through sheer hard work--he coached Lieja Koeman at the Olympics and although the shot putter was ranked 23rd in the world she managed to finish ninth in the competition. In recognition of his achievements, he was named as the 2000 Amsterdam Coach of the Year.De Finale van Topsport in Amsterdam. Topsport Amsterdam. Retrieved on 2009-02-25.

As director he took on responsibilities for British athletes including Dean Macey, Ashia Hansen and Jonathan Edwards, though they all retained personal coaches. In 2003 he asked Kelly Sotherton to join his training group and she agreed. Although she was ranked 57th in the world for the heptathlon, she won the bronze medal at the 2004 Athens Olympics. However, this was still not enough for Van Commenee and he branded her \\"a wimp\\" for not managing to finish in second place. Later on, he expressed regret over the timing of the comment but Sotherton stood by her coach regardless, stating: \\"People always go on about that quote, but they have to remember that Charles was the one who got me in the position to be an Olympic medallist...I don't think any other coach could have got me to where he did.\\" In 2004 the position of performance director became available at UK Athletics.

From left to right: Tygra, Snarf, Panthro, Lion-O, WilyKit, Cheetara, and WilyKat. The following is a list of characters that appear in the American animated series ThunderCats, its 2011 reboot, ThunderCats Roar, and its related media. Original ThunderCatsJaga= Jaga (voiced by Earl Hammond in the original series, Corey Burton in the 2011 series, Larry Kenney in the 2020 series) is also known as \\"Jaga the Wise\\" and is based on the jaguar. This elder warrior was once regarded as the mightiest and greatest of all Thundercats by Lion-O himself. In his youth, Jaga was the Lord of the Thundercats, and rescued a young Hachiman from being trapped in the Jade Dragon (which later became a part of the Treasure of Thundera). An adviser and protector of the Lord's family, Jaga wielded the \\"Sword of Omens\\" and was a formidable fighter in combat. After Claudus was blinded, Jaga became the main guardian of the Eye of Thundera, the Sword of Omens, and the Treasure of Thundera. It was Jaga who gathered the nobles of the Thundercats to escort Lion-O and the Eye of Thundera to safety, but did not survive the trip to Third Earth as he volunteered to pilot the damaged ship while the others slept. Because of this, Jaga died of old age. However, Jaga does reappear on Third Earth as a ghost (seen only by Lion-O at first) to guide him in his lessons and adventures. At times, he appears before the other Thundercats as well such as when facing down Grune the Destroyer's ghost and when the Thundercats need to rescue their fellow Thunderians. Jaga's physical body does reappear at one point during the original series in the episode \\"The Astral Prison\\" where he was trapped in another dimension, prompting Lion-O to travel there to rescue him from being held captive by an evil inhabitant of said dimension. His fate as a physical living entity after this was never revealed, but his spirit form continued to appear throughout the series. In the 2011 series, Jaga serves as head of Thundera's cleric warriors, possessing a knowledge of ancient secrets, superhuman speed, projecting lightning from his staff. In his prime, he used the \\"Sword of Omens\\" in an epic duel against Ratilla. At the start of the series, Jaga sacrifices himself to ensure Lion-O and his group escape. This resulted with him being tortured into revealing the location of the \\"Book of Omens\\" to Mumm-Ra, though doing his best to resist the villain's magic when sealed within a lantern, eventually his free will wavers along with his physical form. Though Jaga destroys the lantern that was keeping his soul intact to save Lion-O from Mumm-Ra, his soul took residence within the Book of Omens and becomes Lion-O's guide. In the 2-part \\"The Trials of Lion-O\\" Pt. 1, Lion-O encounters Jaga in the entrance to the Spirit World. Jaga tells Lion-O of the challenges he must undergo to gain a second chance in life. But when he failed the final test, Jaga allows Lion-O to return to the living long enough to save the other ThunderCats though it would exile Lion-O's soul to Limbo by sunrise. However, once saving his friends, Lion-O learns from Jaga that it was actually a test like the other challenges and allows Lion-O to remain among the living. Jaga character was described as being based on \\"Wisdom\\". =Lion-O= Lion-O (voiced by Larry Kenney in the original series, Will Friedle and Tara Strong (young) in the 2011 series is the leader and the hereditary \\"Lord of the Thundercats\\"., Max Mittelman in the 2020 series) - Lion-O, based on the lion, wields the legendary Sword of Omens, which is able to fire bolts of energy and allows Lion-O to see across great distances with its power of \\"Sight Beyond Sight\\", the sword was created from the same star as the sword of plundar, the eye of thundera is the eye which belonged to a beast who was as gigantic as the mountain .he held immense power and was imprisoned in the gem forged by the ancestors of JagaJaga,who sacrificed themselves to save the Thunderians from his wrath, as well as the Claw Shield, a gauntlet that launches grappling lines from its claws. A mere child of twelve years old at the time of Thundera's destruction, Lion-O aged to adulthood during the trip to Third Earth when his suspension capsule failed to prevent him from aging too much. Although cunning and skillful, he is truly a child in a man's body, and throughout the series, must learn what it takes to become a true leader and gain true maturity. In the latter half of the show's first season, Lion-O has to put all that he has learned to use in the \\"Anointment Trials\\", which consist of contests of strength, speed, cunning, and intelligence (this last is referred to as \\"mind-power\\" in the story arc) against each of the other Thundercats. (Complicating matters for Lion-O is the fact that he is required to be unarmed for the contests; moreover, the other Thundercats are not permitted to assist him. The Mutants attempt, but ultimately without success, to take advantage of this last in an effort to leave the Thundercats leaderless.) Ultimately triumphing over Mumm-Ra in a final battle (\\"The Trial Of Evil\\") in the heart of the villain's pyramid in which he discovers that Mumm-Ra, like any Egyptian mummy, is dependent upon his sarcophagus, Lion-O is crowned the true Lord of the Thundercats in a grand inaugural ceremony attended by nearly every inhabitant of Third Earth. In the 2011 version, Lion-O is a teenager instead of being a boy inside an adult body. Lion-O can also be a bit of a hothead but is by far the most patient and understanding cat next to Cheetara. He is the only one at the beginning who believes that technology and Mumm-Ra exist even though the technology is sold across Third Earth. Lion-O believes that the other races of Third Earth should be treated equally as seen when Lion-O was defending two persecuted Lizards from some Thunderians until Claudus broke up the fight. After Claudus was killed by Mumm-Ra, Lion-O becomes the new Lord of the Thundercats. His catchphrase is \\"Whiskers!\\" whenever he finds himself in a bad situation. In \\"Legacy\\", it is revealed that Lion-O had an ancestor named Leo who played a part in the defeat of Mumm-Ra. Lion-O's weapons are the Sword of Omens and the Claw Shield. It is shown that Lion-O had feelings for Cheetara until in \\"Between Brothers\\" when she confessed her feelings for Tygra. In \\"Native Son\\", it is shown that Lion-O had an unnamed mother who died giving birth to him. In Recipe for Disaster it is shown that Lion-O had attempted to work through his relationship issues with Cheetara by pursuing Pumyra, trying multiple times to court her, all of which ended in disaster. However, after saving her from Mumm-Ra yet again she gives him a kiss on the cheek in thanks. However, in \\"What Lies Above Part 2\\", the feeling was revealed to be an act as she reveals her loyalty and love to Mumm-Ra and only toyed with Lion-O's emotions to further her advantage. Lion-O character was described as being based on Courage. In ThunderCats Roar, Lion-O is depicted as being child-like with his antics annoying some of the ThunderCats. Lion-O is renamed Le√≥n-O in the Spanish version, Leo in the German version, Starlion in the French version, and Lion in the Brazilian version. Originally Lion-O was to be named Lion-L in the English language version. =Panthro= Panthro (voiced by Earle Hyman in the original series, Kevin Michael Richardson in the 2011 series, Chris Jai Alex in the 2020 series) is the next noble and greatest warrior after Jaga, and based on the panther. Even though a warrior in all forms of ThunderCats martial arts fighting, Panthro has a brilliant mind, which he uses as the chief mechanic/engineer and pilot for the ThunderCats. He is also physically the strongest and is a cunning warrior in combat, relying as much on martial arts as on physical strength. With Tygra's help, he builds all of the vehicles the ThunderCats use on Third Earth‚Äîincluding the ThunderTank, the Feliner and the ThunderClaw, ThunderStrike, and HoverCat. Panthro is a complex ThunderCat. On the one hand, he has great passion, love of family, and life. With an infectious laugh, accompanied by a good sense of humor. On the other hand, he is a stone-cold warrior. He lives by the ThunderCats warrior code. Pride, excellence, and loyalty are a hallmark of what makes Panthro tick. Because of his passion, he is known to lose his patience with other ThunderCats. On the field of battle, however, he is cool, calm and collected. Because of this, Panthro has gained respect both from friends and enemies alike. They respect the king but fear the panther. In combat, he uses a pair of nunchaku with open-away cat-paws, which house several chemical spray-compounds, and objects such as ball bearings, that he can use against foes. The spikes on his chest bands can be used as projectile weapons or as rappelling lines also. Panthro does have a fear of bats. In the 2011 series, Panthro is one of Claudus' more loyal soldiers who was sent with his friend Grune to find the Book of Omens. Their attempted search resulted with Mumm-Ra's release and Panthro being betrayed by Grune, and ruing a struggle, fell down an abyss and was believed killed. However, Panthro survived the fall and constructed the ThunderTank, which he later used to save Lion-O's group from Slythe's platoon. Though he questioned Lion-O's ability to lead, Panthro eventually accepted him as the new king. Unlike the rest of the ThunderCats, he never learned how to swim. In \\"Between Brothers,\\" Panthro duels with Grune when he and Slithe attack the Elephants' village against Mumm-Ra's orders. Panthro loses his arms while trapping Grune in the astral plane. He was later outfitted with mechanical arms built by the Berbils which can also elongate themselves. In \\"The Pit,\\" it was revealed that he was an old friend of Dobo back when they were slaves in a gladiator arena called The Pit which was located in a city that is inhabited by Dogs. Panthro later escaped the Pit when it turned out that the match the next day would be a deathmatch. This caused Dobo to feel bitter towards Panthro until Panthro revealed the deathmatch would pit him and Dobo against each other. In \\"What Lies Above\\" it is revealed Panthro is afraid of heights, which he finds out during the Feliner's first flight. =Tygra= Tygra (voiced by Peter Newman in the original series, Matthew Mercer in the 2011 series, Patrick Seitz in the 2020 series) is a staunch, level-headed warrior based on the tiger. Tygra is known as the ThunderCat architect and scientist. He is the one Lion-O often turns to as second-in-command and for counsel. He is responsible for the design of all of the ThunderCat structures on Third Earth‚Äîthe Cat's Lair and the Tower of Omens. He is also gifted with \\"mind- power\\"‚Äîthe ability to create lifelike illusions in other people's minds; he used this for Lion-O's Anointment Trial, but it puts a great strain on him. He uses a whip-like bolas in combat, with which he can render himself invisible to the naked eye. In the episode \\"All That Glitters\\", Lion-O instructs Tygra \\"If I do not return, you will be the new Lord of the ThunderCats\\". This verifies that indeed Tygra is the second-in-command. Tygra's weakness is that he is not able to swim when not invisible. Also, Tygra has shown to be easily influenced by external stimuli more than any other ThunderCat (\\"The Garden of Delights\\", \\"Turgamar the Tuska\\" and \\"Crystal Canyon\\"); he also claimed to be shy when being a kid. Patient, analytic and calm, Tygra is the quietest ThunderCat, and usually considers every part of the problem before making a decision. Where creators Ted Wolf and Leonard Starr described Panthro's character as being based on \\"strength\\" and Cheetara's character as being based on \\"speed\\", Tygra's character was described as being based on \\"integrity.\\" In the 2011 series, the character is the adopted older brother of Lion-O. A flirtatious ladies man, Tygra possesses xenophobia, a jealous streak, and superiority to Lion-O in every way, all of which often serve to cause friction between himself and Lion-O. As he would learn later in the season, Tygra is of the Tiger Clan who were forced, by the spiteful other cat clans, to live in the frozen mountains far from Thundera due to their steadfast continued loyalty to Mumm-Ra even after the latter's entrapment. Sent to Thundera as a baby by his biological father Javan, Tygra was raised by Claudus and his wife with the latter loving Tygra dearly prior to her death while giving birth to Lion-O. Losing both the right to succeed his foster father and the only mother he knew, Tygra grew to hate Lion-O and questioning the latter's decisions after he became the new Lord of the Thundercats. Furthermore, Tygra fell in love with Cheetara when they first met as children in the past, although he believed she never returned his feelings for her. Her apparent friendship with Lion-O gave him another reason to bear a grudge on his brother. Tygra and Cheetara eventually become a couple after Cheetara confesses her love for Tygra. Soon after, Tygra meets his birth father and inherits his whip. In \\"What Lies Above\\" he is explained to be a natural pilot able to fly any craft without any training at all due to his ancestors serving as pilots under Mumm- Ra. In ThunderCats Roar, Tygra is depicted as a neat freak. Tygra is renamed Tigro in the Spanish, German and French versions. =Cheetara= Cheetara (voiced by Lynne Lipton in the original series, Emmanuelle Chriqui and Grey DeLisle (young) in the 2011 series, Erica Lindbeck in the 2020 series) is a female warrior, based on the cheetah. She is the only adult female ThunderCat until the later appearance of Pumyra. She is as lovely as she is brave and caring. Often a voice of reason, she is also the bearer of a budding \\"sixth sense,\\" detecting when something is unsafe or if evil is near. This precognitive sense, which Cheetara regards as a curse for the most part, also allows her to perceive visions‚Äîwhether involuntary or by forcing herself‚Äîbut can leave her very weak; she may require days to regain her strength. It was this ability that enabled Lion-O to learn the fates of Lynx-O, Pumyra, and Bengali the day when Thundera exploded. She has incredible speed, once clocked at 120 m.p.h. on a morning jog. She can maintain this speed only for brief periods, but with it, she is very fast in combat. Her weapon of choice is a baton that expands into a bo staff that can grow or shrink to variable lengths. When not in use, it is attached to her left armband. The season one episode \\"Sixth Sense\\" briefly hinted at the idea of romantic attraction between Cheetara and Lion-O, however, the subject was never revisited again in the series. In the Wildstorm/DC comic book series it is revealed that, while most of the ThunderCats detest and avoid water, Cheetara loves it and is by far the best swimmer among them. In the Wildstorm/DC miniseries ThunderCats: The Return, Cheetara is revealed to have been made a slave of the mutants during Lion-O's time training inside the Book of Omens, and it is hinted that she was sexually abused by them, though it is never outright confirmed. The comic again references the ideas of a possible romance between Cheetara and Lion-O‚Äî seemingly expanding on the hints from the episode \\"Sixth Sense\\", indicating that feelings may have developed post-cartoon and pre-comics between the two‚Äî but indicates that Cheetara had begun to resent Lion-O after the defeat of the ThunderCats by Mumm-Ra and the Mutants and her ensuing enslavement for not coming to her rescue sooner, and her feelings had shifted towards Panthro in the intervening years, who is hinted to reciprocate her feelings when he and Lion-O manage to rescue her from the Mutants. In the 2011 series, Cheetara is one of the last remaining cleric warriors. When she originally tried to join the Order of Clerics as a child, she was initially turned down by Jaga, because even though she had the speed possessed by clerics, she lacked the patience. Despite being turned down, Cheetara decided to show Jaga she had the patience needed to become a cleric and began to wait in front of the Order's doors. While waiting, she was given a flower by Tygra, which helped Cheetara sustain herself for days, until Jaga finally allowed her to join the clerics. In the aftermath of Thundera's downfall, Cheetara's possibly the sole surviving member of the Order, other than Jaga, who lives on in spirit form. Cheetara initially served as an encourager to Lion-O, since she never shunned him for his interest in technology and initially seems to support his kindness to other races. During the first half of the first season, both Tygra and Lion-O harbor romantic feelings for her and competed for her love. Originally many believed Cheetara held feelings for Lion-O and would choose him, but in the end, it's revealed she has always been in love with Tygra since their childhood when he had shown her kindness and support during the days she desired to become a cleric. Cheetara and Tygra become a couple shortly thereafter and Cheetara later abandons her duties as a Cleric in \\"New Alliances\\" to save Tygra's life. In ThunderCats Roar, Cheetara has an athlete personality. Cheetara is renamed Chitara in the Spanish version, Geparda in the German version, F√©libelle in the French version. In the WildStorm/DC comic mini-series, Tygra eventually marries Cheetara and the two raise a pair of twin cubs. =WilyKit and WilyKat= WilyKit (voiced by Lynne Lipton in original series, Madeleine Hall in the 2011 series, Erica Lindbeck in the 2020 series) and WilyKat (voiced by Peter Newman in original series, Eamon Pirruccello in the 2011 series, Max Mittelman in the 2020 series) are twin siblings, Kat being the older brother and Kit as the younger sister where both of them are based on the wildcat; they are jointly referred to as \\"ThunderKittens\\" by the other characters, although technically they are older than Lion-O. In the original series, Kat appears to be the equivalent to a human that is twelve years of age. They are the mischief-makers, and often have their own lessons to learn alongside Lion-O while they live on Third Earth, where they frequently use tricks and traps to combat evil. Kit is the more adventurous, while the older Kat usually errs on the side of caution. Kit also appears to be the more agile, and at times, she employs a rolling-attack against the enemy. Their agility is often displayed when they ride their \\"space boards\\"‚Äîspecially designed flying devices shaped like Earth surfboards that can carry them over long distances. Each uses special capsules, balls and other gimmick weapons carried in pouches and on their belts. They sometimes use slingshots to fire these at the Mutants or other foes. They also carry trick lariats, with which they can either tangle and ensnare foes, or use to pull themselves out of danger. In the first episode, they appeared to be slightly older than Lion-O, but when they went into suspended animation, they did not age as far in their suspension capsules as Lion-O did in his. In the 2011 version, they are younger in age and were originally from a low-class family in the countryside living with their mother, their father, and their two siblings. When the two lost their father to a tornado, resulting in the family becoming more down-trodden, the twins resolve to run away from home to find the lost city of El Dara and become rich. However, upon arriving to Thundera, they were forced to become street urchins and lock-picking pickpockets in order to survive the slums with their aspirations the only thing keeping them going. When the Lizards attack Thundera, the two manage to escape during the chaos before eventually teaming up with the ThunderCats on their journey. In this version, WilyKit and WilyKat have tails, which none of the main adult ThunderCats except Panthro possess (how Panthro lost his is never shown nor explained), and visible external ears. Like in the original series, WilyKat possesses gimmick weapons with his usual weapon being a grappling hook called a Flick. WilyKit also possesses a special musical instrument called a Flupe that she uses to play a soothing melody that their mother used to hum to the siblings, able to put anyone in a hypnotic trance. During her time with the Elephants, learning to use her flute to shatter boulders when in tune with the Elephant's trumpets. Over the course of the first half in season one, Wilykit gained a spiritual outlook on life as she and her brother become more involved in their adult companions' fight. This new outlook allowed the youth to assume Cheetara's abandoned role of Cleric, encouraging Lion-O when he needs it the most. In the second half, the twins acquire hoverboards from the Berbils and later the Forever Bag, a magic bag previous thieves possessed that has an infinite storage space, activated by the magic word \\"rankinbass\\" (a reference to Rankin/Bass Productions, which produced the original series). In ThunderCats Roar, Wilykit has a tomboy personality, while Wilykat is the more mature half of the duo. WilyKit and WilyKat are renamed Felina y Felino in the Spanish version (except in the 2011 version, where they retain their original names), and MiniKit und MiniKat in the German version. =ThunderCats who appeared later in the series= At the start of the series' second season, it was revealed to Lion-O (after having a recurring dream about the final moments of the destruction of Thundera) that there are three more Thunderians living on Third Earth whom Jaga was unable to rescue. They survived the cataclysm when rescued by a Ro-Bear Berbil scout ship piloted by two Berbils. The ship was damaged in the final explosion of the planet and made it to Third Earth landing on an unknown island somewhere in the northern sea as the ship didn't have enough fuel to get to the Berbil Village. This was revealed to Lion-O when Cheetara focuses her powers into tapping into this knowledge. After Mumm-Ra tries to capture them to use as bait to destroy the ThunderCats at Firerock Mountain (which is where a lot of Thundrainium is located), these three Thunderians are rescued and brought back to the Cat's Lair, where Lion-O anoints them as new ThunderCats. They initially come to live in Cat's Lair until after the arrival of the Lunataks, at which time they are stationed at the Tower of Omens. Bengali Bengali (voiced by Peter Newman) is one of the two younger Thundereans among the trio, named after the bengal tiger and resembling the white variant. This warrior is a skilled blacksmith like his father before him and it proves valuable after the Sword of Omens is once again broken. Fast and agile like Tygra, Bengali is called \\"brother\\" by him, but it is unclear if they share a true familial bond or if the greeting is merely meant as a term of endearment (given that the new ThunderCats repeatedly call the originals \\"Nobles\\" while referring to themselves as \\"mere Thunderians,\\" it seems unlikely that there is any family relationship between the two). Another possibility is that because they are both tigers, the Ben-Gal clan may be cousins to the Tygra clan, even though one is considered nobility while the other is not. In combat, Bengali wields a weapon called the Hammer of Thundera (which he also uses when doing blacksmith-related work). It can shoot energy blasts, and carries smoke pellets in its handle, to allow him to cause confusion and provide cover for withdrawal from a fight. He is the only Thundercat who does not appear in the 2011 series. Lynx-O Lynx-O (voiced by Doug Preis in the original series, Kevin Michael Richardson in the 2011 version) is the oldest of the trio who is based on the lynx. Lynx-O was spared the sight of the destruction of their homeworld by a cruel twist of fate: a blast of intense heat and fire blinded him moments before he and his two younger companions were rescued, leaving his eyes all orange denoting blindness. Because of this injury, Lynx-O has had to adapt to survive on Third Earth and has done so by honing his other senses to super-human levels. His sense of touch, smell, taste and hearing are far above those of the other ThunderCats, and this affords him a type of \\"sixth sense,\\" though it is not like the one Cheetara possesses. Though blind, Lynx-O is still a formidable fighter. His sense of touch allows him to find pressure points on a foe's body to knock them off balance or stun them. He can also feel vibrations, which allow him to evade attacks and capture, and can use a Sonic Reflector as a weapon in combat. His greatest skill comes in utilizing a special \\"braille board\\"‚Äîa device that allows him to translate information coming from sensor systems inside the Tower of Omens, enabling him to see into the gloom of Dark Side. This same device also allows him to pilot the ThunderStrike aircraft through the Valley of Mists when the ThunderCats need to find a way through to Dark Side. In the 2011 series, Lynx-O is a general under Claudus. He first made a cameo as one of Thundera's lookout sentries. It is unknown as to whether or not he survived Thundera's destruction. If there was a season two, it would have depicted Lynx-O's history with Slithe and show how the Lizards sided with Mumm-Ra. Pumyra Pumyra (voiced by Gerrianne Raphael in the original series, Pamela Adlon in the 2011 series) is another female Thunderian along with Cheetara and WilyKit. This young woman who is based on the puma is a talented healer and medic. She uses her knowledge of Thunderian medicine, combined with the wide range of medical supplies to be found on Third Earth, to help heal and cure her fellow ThunderCats. Her compassionate nature lends to offering an alternative perspective, solving problems or conflict without fighting by using compromise and understanding. Possibly the most agile ThunderCat next to the ThunderKittens, Pumyra employs an incredible leaping ability‚Äîoften able to vault higher than even great jumpers like Tygra or the ThunderKittens. She was also shown to be able to move in short bursts of super-speed (while moving fast she resembled a flash of lightning darting from place to place). In combat, she uses special whipcord, which resembles a \\"cat's tail,\\" that can launch special pellets and spheres like an ancient sling. Pumyra's role gradually decreased after her role in the first two movies. The only episode to focus on Pumyra was \\"Mumm-Rana's Belt\\" where she helps to regain Mumm- Rana's belt after it was stolen by Luna. In \\"The Return to Thundera Part IV,\\" she and Tygra stay behind on Third Earth in order to continue protecting the planet from danger. In the 2011 series, Pumyra is portrayed as bitter, spiteful, passionate, independent, agile, sly, and manipulative. She takes over Tygra's role in questioning Lion-O's decisions. Unlike Tygra, Pumyra easily manipulates Lion-O to side with her. Pumyra originally fought against the lizards during the fall of Thundera before being wounded and left to die under the rubble as nobody could hear her. In her final moments, she witnessed Lion-O, Tygra, Cheetara, WilyKit, WilyKat, and Snarf fleeing the city. Pumyra died hateful and resentful towards Lion-O and company for abandoning Thundera while they failed to hear her pleas for help. Sensing her strong hatred, Mumm- Ra resurrected Pumyra to give her a second chance in life, serving him as his spy, placing her among the captive Thunderian slaves to be sold to Dobo. From there, meeting Lion-O and managing to keep her need for revenge in check when she is unable to finish off Lion-O, Pumyra earns his trust and love while serving as a beacon for Mumm-Ra to regain the Sword of Plun-Darr and track the Thundercats' movement. Lion-O viewed Pumyra as a possible love interest and makes several attempts to impress her which usually result in her being injured, captured or humiliated. Although Pumyra often rejects Lion-O, on rare occasions she displays acts of affection to keep him obsessed with her. Cheetara is concerned with Lion-O's feelings for Pumyra and doesn't think she is right for Lion-O. It was during the siege of Avista that Pumyra reveals her true colors by giving the Tech Stone to Mumm-Ra, who she calls her true master and love. After taking a hit from Ro-Bear Bill and Dobo, Pumyra leaves with Mumm-Ra and promises to kill Lion-O the next time they meet. According to the creators if there had been a season two, Pumyra would've turned into a wicked insectoid due to her hunger for more power. Thunderians on ThunderaClaudus= Claudus (voiced by Earl Hammond in the original series, Larry Kenney in the 2011 series) is the previous Lord of the ThunderCats and Lion-O's father who like his son is based on the lion. Claudus ruled Thundera before its destruction. He lost his sight during a war he fought against the mutants of Plun-Darr. In the episode \\"Return to Thundera,\\" Lion-O is transported back in time to Thundera the day before it was destroyed. He later rescued his father from past versions of Slithe and Vultureman (who were attempting to recover plans for a War-Bot that had fallen into the hands of Claudus's spies). He then proceeded to give these plans to Lion-O, who used them in the present to destroy the mutants' War-Bot. Believed to have died on Thundera while assisting the royal flagship in taking off, he was later found to have been captured by the Shadowmaster. Through a sequence of nightmares, Lion-O eventually learns from Jaga of his father's imprisonment in the Shadow Realm and is able to rescue him. Claudus is currently with Jaga in the afterlife. In the 2011 series, Claudus is a stern father to Lion-O and the adoptive father of Tygra. He had a wife who died giving birth to Lion-O. When Grune and Panthro had fought bravely to get promoted to general, Claudus told them that he has given the job to Lynx-O. He was the one who sent Panthro and Grune to find the Book of Omens. When Lion-O was fighting off some Thunderians who were beating up two imprisoned Lizards (where Lion-O was assisted by Tygra and Cheetara), Claudus arrived to break up the fight. He was convinced by Lion-O to let the Lizards go free and back to their homeland. When Thundera was being attacked by the Lizards, Claudus is murdered by Mumm-Ra (who had assumed Panthro's form). Lion-O, Cheetara, and Tygra later hold a funeral pyre for him after escaping with the Sword of Omens. Thunderians on New Thundera When the planet of Thundera is reformed in Season Two of the series by Mumm-Ra in a plot to claim the Sword of Plun-Darr, the ThunderCats must work to stabilize the planet before it can tear itself apart again. It is here that they discover another ThunderCat and gain additional allies. =Jagara= Jagara (voiced by Gerrianne Raphael) is found deep within the core of New Thundera. This powerful, ancient Thundercat (like Jaga, based on the jaguar) is an immortal sorceress. Her duty is to guard the massive gyroscope that keeps the planet intact. She uses the powers of levitation, teleportation, and psychokinesis to perform her tasks and to defend the gyroscope from attackers. It is noted by Jaga (no relation) that she has been acting in this capacity for countless years. =Thunderian commoners= * Torr (voiced by Larry Kenney) ‚Äì A young Thunderian commoner of indeterminate feline motive rescued by the ThunderCats along with other commoners from their ship drifting into deep space. Since then, Torr has been an ally of the ThunderCats where he has often helped the ThunderCats in various missions. In \\"Well of Doubt,\\" Torr is shown to have a history with Baron Tass. * Leah (voiced by Lynne Lipton) ‚Äì A Thunderian little girl of indeterminate feline motive whose escape pod was intercepted by Mumm-Ra and landed in the Jungles of Darkness. Her doll was used by the Ancient Spirits of Evil to disguise the Mirror Wraith to infiltrate the Cat's Lair forcing her to keep it a secret. She was later freed from the influence of the Mirror Wraith by the ThunderCats. Other Thunderians The following Thunderians appeared in different media projects: * Leo (voiced by Will Friedle in the first appearance, Jason Marsden in the second appearance) ‚Äì Exclusive to the 2011 series, Leo was Lion-O's direct ancestor and Mumm-Ra's right hand. Leo originally believed in Mumm-Ra's ideals for order across the cosmos prior to witnessing the death of the Plun-Darr galaxy. Deciding to engineer a rebellion, Leo gathered the scrapes from what remained from the creation of the Sword of Plun-Darr to create the Sword of Omens to defeat Mumm-Ra. In the aftermath of the Black Pyramid's descent to Third Earth, the Stones of Power taken from Mumm-Ra were split amongst the major races of Third earth with Leo keeping the War Stone with the Cats as the Eye of Thundera. * Panthera (voiced by Cree Summer) ‚Äì Exclusive to the 2011 series, Panthera was a Thunderian based on a panther who was among the Thunderians that worked for Mumm-Ra. Being Leo's second-in-command and girlfriend, she tried to convince him to betray Mumm-Ra. It was only after the death of the Plun-Darr galaxy that Panthera convinces Leo in planning a mutiny against Mumm-Ra. Her fate after the Black Pyramid's descent to Third Earth is unknown (although, given that she and Leo were implied to be a couple, it is possible that she married him and is also Lion-O's ancestor). * Javan (voiced by Robin Atkin Downes) ‚Äì Exclusive to the 2011 series, Javan is a Thunderian based on the Javan tiger and is the biological father of Tygra. His ancestors were shunned by the other Thunderians as the Tiger Clan branch of the Thunderians were still loyal to Mumm-Ra. When his kin was inflicted with a plague, Javan chooses not to turn to Thundera for aid and instead invoke the power of the Ancient Spirits of Evil to save his people. But once learning their price for their survival is the death of his newborn son Tygra, Javan couldn't bring himself to sacrifice the infant to honor their pact and send him away. As a result, the Ancient Spirits bound the souls of the Tiger Clan to the living world as cursed shape-shifting shadow monsters that obey the Ancient Spirits of Evil's every command at nightfall. Many years later while he and Lion-O were in the mountains, Tygra came across his ancestral home and meets Javan, expressing discontent towards the father who abandoned him. It was only later that Lion-O learned the truth of the curse as Javan tells him not to tell Tygra and get him away from the village before the sun sets. However, upon learning that Caspin and some of his royal court are going to kill his son, Javan fends them off before the curse takes effect and he mindlessly attacks Tygra. However, Tygra's act of humility broke the curse so both Javan and his kin are able to pass on to the next life. Tygra then inherits his father's whip. * Caspin (voiced by Jim Cummings) ‚Äì Exclusive to the 2011 series, Caspin is a Thunderian based on the Caspian tiger. He is among the tiger-based Thunderians that live in the mountains and serves their leader Javan as his right-hand Cat on his royal court. When Lion-O and Tygra came across the Tiger Clan's cave, Caspin took them to meet Javan. During this time, Caspin saw an opportunity to end his people's curse as he and his conspirators decided to kill Tygra themselves. However, Javan comes to Tygra's aid and was forced to kill Caspin in self-defense stating that it didn't have to be this way. Before dying, Caspin told Javan that it had to be this way since it was Javan's fault that the entire Tiger Clan was cursed. But as the curse is broken and the Tiger Clan was revealed to have already died long ago, Caspin's spirit body faded away alongside the spirit bodies of the other Tiger Clan members. * Lion-S (voiced by Kaitlyn Robrock) - Exclusive to ThunderCats Roar, Lion-S is a Thunderian based on a lion. She came to Third Earth where she met Lion-O who found a kindred spirit in her due to the fact that they have good sword tricks and a talent for pranks like they did on Mumm-Ra and the Mutants. What Lion-O didn't know is that she is an escaped convict from the Gray Penal Planet who Mandora was after. While Lion-S managed to swipe the Sword of Omens, Lion-O revealed one other sword trick as he quoted \\"Sword of Omens, come to my hand.\\" Lion-O allowed Lion-S to go which got the ThunderCats in trouble with Mandora for aiding and abetting an escaped convict. The Snarfs The Snarfs are a race of intelligent cat-like creatures that are plump, fuzzy and kind. Snarfs are native to Thundera, living in the Valley of Snarfs, and many of their numbers act as servants to Thunderean nobility, happily working as cooks, nursemaids, squires and so forth. When Thundera was destroyed, forty-nine Snarfs were able to commandeer a Mutant tanker and made their way to an uninhabited planet which they took as their own, dubbing it the \\"Planet of Snarfs\\". Later, when Mumm-Ra recreated Thundera, he captured the Snarfs and brought them back to their home planet, putting them to work searching for the Treasure of Thundera. Subsequently, liberated by the ThunderCats, the Snarfs returned to living happily on Thundera. Snarfs are the only creatures in the Universe incapable of evil (except while possessed), although, in episode 105, Snarf becomes corrupt with the power to control the other ThunderCats. Quick and clever, a Snarf is a loyal friend, though their small size often makes them a target for Mutants or other evil creatures. The Snarfs have proved to be valuable allies to the ThunderCats in times of peril. Though their fighting skills are more than wanting, the Snarfs have an inherent invulnerability/resistance to many (but not all) forms of magic and mind-control. This ability has enabled the Snarfs to save the other ThunderCats on several occasions. Snarfs are known to end their sentences with the squeaking exclamation for which they are named‚Äî\\"snarf, snarf!\\" =Snarf= Snarf (voiced by Bob McFadden in the original series, Satomi K≈çrogi in the 2011 series) is an elder Snarf, properly known by his name Osbert, which he hates. Snarf served as a nursemaid and protector for Lion-O when he was a boy. After Lion-O grew up, Snarf found that often Lion-O did not want to have him \\"mothering\\" or protecting him. Still, Snarf has remained loyal to Lion-O and the other ThunderCats. At times, he does come through in a pinch with an idea and takes action when it is needed. Despite his age, he does keep up with the others. Even though not a fighter by skill or nature, Snarf is very agile (he boasts he can outplay anyone at tail bail or kick-the-bucket). He also can communicate with other animals on Third Earth to enlist their help in his tasks, and once even tricked the Ancient Spirits of Evil into giving him a power-up to become a being called Snarf-Ra. In the 2011 version, Snarf is more of a pet to Lion-O and does not speak English but can make animal sounds (though it seems Lion-O can still understand him). In later episodes, he goes \\"Snarf\\". In ThunderCats Roar, Snarf is depicted as a robot animal. The episode \\"Snarf's Day Off\\" reveals that Snarf can take the form of a normal house cat once a month to pay a visit to an old lady named Mrs. Gristildi. He accompanied Mrs. Gristildi to the craft fair where she competed with a disguised Mumm-Ra. When Snarf's true form was revealed by Mumm-Ra, Mrs. Gristildi sheds her disguise revealing her true form of Mumm-Rana who beats up Mumm-Ra. Now knowing each other's secrets, both of them use the photos of Mumm-Ra's beatings for their homemade calendar. =Snarfer= Snarfer (voiced by Bob McFadden) is a young and excitable Snarf who is Snarf's young nephew. He was thought lost when Thundera exploded but was one of the surviving Snarfs that made it to the Planet of Snarfs. Slightly more aggressive than his uncle, Snarfer is a keen mechanic and pilot in his own right, having been educated at \\"Snarf College\\" while majoring in Snarf-Studies (Snarf once said he was a \\"college boy\\"). He does tend to babble when over-excited, but at times he can be just as level-headed as Tygra. Though smaller than Snarf, he does not allow that to get in his way when he wants to help friends. It was through him that the ThunderCats learned, much to their surprise, that Snarf's real name was Osbert‚Äîand that he hated the name. =Snarf Oswald and Snarf Eggbert= Snarf Oswald (voiced by Earle Hyman) and Snarf Eggbert (voiced by Larry Kenney) are two of the Snarfs who survived the destruction of Thundera, this duo became the ThunderCats main Snarf \\"contacts\\" on New Thundera. Oswald was originally mentioned by Snarf during the first season, noting that he owed him \\"fifty thunder-dollars.\\" Natives of Third EarthThe Ro-Bear Berbils= The Robear Berbils are partly-furred robotic bears from the planet Ro-Bear. Because their homeworld is so tiny, they must form other colonies on distant worlds to survive. Small and harmless-looking, the Berbils are steadfast, hardy workers and skilled farmers, cooks, and craftsmen. It was thanks to them that Tygra was able to build Cat's Lair‚Äîand later the Tower of Omens‚Äîso quickly. Apparently, the Robear Berbils are cybernetic organisms, as they are able to eat and digest organic food. When they were first encountered, the ThunderCats protected the Berbil's candy fruit crops from the Trollogs and the Giantors. In the 2011 series, the Berbils are shown to be more bear-like and have an ability to roll up into balls. The Berbils made themselves known to the ThunderCats when they helped to repair the Thunder Tank and give them food. Panthro was against their cute appearance first until it came to repairing Ro-Bear-Bill following an attack by the Conqueror (who had been abducting Berbils and selling them as slaves). The ThunderCats managed to help the Berbils drive away the Conqueror along with his Trollog and Giantor customers. The Berbils later help in constructing Panthro's new arms and upgrading the Thunder Tank. In \\"What Lies Above\\" Pt. 2, Wilykit and Wilykat were able to get the Berbils to help them fight Mumm-Ra and save Avista. After Avista was safely landed on the ground, the Berbils began working to get Avista operational again. * Ro-Bear-Bill (voiced by Earl Hammond in the original series, Dee Bradley Baker in the 2011 series, Dana Snyder in the 2020 series) - A brown Ro-Bear Berbil and the co-leader of the Berbils. He is one of the first Ro-Bear Berbils to befriend the ThunderCats and often supply information about local places, people and phenomena on Third Earth. Through their fields and forests of fruit trees, they are also able to provide the Thundereans with new food stuffs. After the Mutants and the Lunataks were removed from Third Earth, Ro-Bear-Bill and Ro-Bear-Belle become members of the League of Third Earth. * Ro-Bear-Belle - An orange Ro-Bear Berbil and co- leader of the Berbils. She is one of the first Ro-Bear Berbils to befriend the ThunderCats and often supply information about local places, people and phenomena on Third Earth. Through their fields and forests of fruit trees, they are also able to provide the Thundereans with new food stuffs. After the Mutants and the Lunataks were removed from Third Earth, Ro-Bear-Bill and Ro- Bear-Belle become members of the League of Third Earth. * Ro-Bear-Bert - A blue Ro-Bear Berbil who is skilled at agriculture, is an expert cook, and doesn't talk much. He and Ro-Bear-Bob were the ones who saved Lynx-O, Bengali, and Pumyra from the destruction of Thundera by inviting them on their ship which Ro-Bear-Bert piloted. The ship was damaged upon evading the explosion of Thundera and landed on an island on Third Earth since it didn't have any more power to get back to the Berbil Village. The two Berbils alongside the other three ThunderCats ends up landing on an uninhabited island where they lived until they were caught by Hammerhand and his pirates. Ro-Bear-Bert and Ro- Bear-Bob were later rescued by the ThunderCats and assumed to have been reunited with the other Berbils. * Ro-Bear-Bob - A yellow Ro-Bear Berbil. He and Ro-Bear-Bert were the ones who saved Lynx-O, Bengali, and Pumyra from the destruction of Thundera by inviting them on their ship. The ship was damaged upon evading the explosion of Thundera and landed on an island on Third Earth since it didn't have any more power to get back to the Berbil Village. The two Berbils alongside the other three ThunderCats ends up landing on an uninhabited island where they lived until they were caught by Hammerhand and his pirates. Ro-Bear-Bob and Ro-Bear-Bert were later rescued by the ThunderCats and assumed to have been reunited with the other Berbils. =Warrior Maidens= The Warrior Maidens are a race of barefoot Amazon women who live in the forests of what is called the Tree-Top Kingdom. They are fierce fighters and very territorial. At first distrustful of the ThunderCats (whom they view as aliens), the Warrior Maidens soon treat them as friends. Often, Nayda and Willa are the two who have the most contact with the ThunderCats. While some of the Warrior Maidens resemble Native Americans, other Warrior Maidens have different skin tones, whereas some of the Warrior Maidens have red hair. * Willa and Nayda (both voiced by Lynne Lipton in the original series, Laila Berzins and Cindy Robinson in the 2020 series) ‚Äì Sisters who are both members of the Warrior Maidens. Willa is their leader while the younger Nayda is a scout and second-in-command. Both are expert markswomen with bows and arrows and are very agile and fleet among the branches of their forest home. Often distrustful of outsiders, both become friends of the ThunderCats, and, by their example, the rest of their people treat them as allies. They often help the Thundereans by showing them paths around Third Earth and using special tricks (like a giant tree-top spider Bushy when it came to rescuing Tygra from Castle Plun-Darr) to aid them on their quests and missions. On one occasion, Willa is even able to use the Sword of Omens' \\"Sight Beyond Sight,\\" which normally is possible only for Lion-O. After the Mutants and the Lunataks are removed from Third Earth, Willa and Nayda become members of the League of Third Earth. In the 2020 series, Willa mostly speaks in grunts with Nayda translating for her. =Wolos= The Wolos are small, furry people who have small villages all around the habitable places of Third Earth. The Wolos work as farmers, carpenters, and fishermen. The Wolos often use donkeys for their transportation. They are gentle folk who often turn to the ThunderCats for protection. In the 2011 series, the Wolos (pronounced \\"Wallow\\" in the reboot) are shown to have rodent-like teeth. * Ponzi (voiced by Jim Meskimen) ‚Äì Exclusive to the 2011 series, Ponzi is a scam artist who travels from town to town to sell \\"miracle elixir\\" that he promises will solve all customers' problems. However, the elixir has unpredictable side effects that force him to leave town. However, meeting the ThunderCats, Ponzi learns his elixir has a neutralizing effect on Sycorax (a monster that Mumm-Ra resurrected as his vessel). He helps the Thundercats with gathering Caracara leaves to make a new batch of elixir and Lion-O with winning Pumyra's affection, though both attempts to help backfire with Ponzi's caterpillar Lucy eating all the Caracara leaves as Sycorax arrives. Upon metamorphosing into her butterfly-like adult stage, Lucy uses the Caracara leaves in her body to crystallize Sycorax causing Mumm-Ra to retreat. Soon after, Ponzi and Lucy take their leave to start their business anew. =Bolkins= The Bolkins are sheep-like people, similar to the Wolos. They are herdspeople and farmers who are just as likely to call for help from the ThunderCats. * Bundun and Hurrick (voiced by Bob McFadden) - Two Bolkins who are friends with each other. They were the ones who accidentally released the spirit of Grune the Destroyer when they were trying to escape from the bad weather. After Jaga's spirit defeated Grune the Destroyer, Bundun and Hurrick were forgiven for their mistake by the ThunderCats. =Tabbuts= The Tabbuts are a race of wealthy yet greedy traders who often appeared as allies of the mutants. They resemble one-horned humanoid pigs in appearance. A ninja that worked for Mumm-Ra once assumed the form of a Tabbut. =Fishmen= Exclusive to the 2011 series, the Fishmen are one of the native sentient species of Third Earth and resembled humanoid fish- like creatures. Fishmen sub-species are mostly based in appearance on the Ostariophysi-based fish and include carps, suckerfish, loaches, goldfish, and minnows. A group of their kind lived in a paradise oasis, somewhere in the Sand Sea until their home was attacked by the massive Ramlak, which consumed all the water of their home. With their home destroyed, Captain Koinelius Tunar, became fixated on getting revenge on the creature and assembled a crew of Fishmen along with a ship to hunt it down. Their journey saw them encounter the ThunderCats, under Lion-O who they captured, and initially attempted to flay as well as eat until the Ramlak attacked. Upon seeing the courage of Lion-O, Captain Tunar decided to let the ThunderCats live and asked for their help in slaying the beast. Ultimately, the Fishman's ship was destroyed by the Ramlak and Captain Tunar was killed but Lion-O managed to slay the creature leading to all the captured water being released into the Sand Sea thus creating an oasis for the Fishmen. The Fishmen thanked Lion-O, assuring him that Tunar's death was his own doing and was beyond help, and decided to remain behind at their new home. In \\"What Lies Above\\" Pt. 2, Wilykit and Wilykat were able to get some of the Fishmen to help them fight Mumm-Ra and save Avista. One Fishman rode with Wilykit and Wilykat since it didn't want to ride in the Forever Bag. * Captain Koinelius Tunar (voiced by Robin Atkin Downes) ‚Äì A member of the Fishmen race who was driven to vengeful rage by the Ramlak stealing both his homeland and his leg, the latter he replaced with a metallic peg leg. He later took command of a ship and assembled a crew of Fishmen with the task of hunting the creature down, claiming actions were in the crew's best interest yet places killing the Ramlak at all costs before them. Encountering the Thundercats with the intent to make them into chum to attract his quarry, Tunar reconsiders once seeing them fight the Ramlak and makes them part of his crew while finding common ground with Lion-O, who is also out for revenge on Mumm-Ra. However, while Lion-O lets go of his revenge to save the Fishman's crew, Tunar became a victim of his own revenge as he is dragged into the Sand Sea while harpooning the Ramlak. Lion-O managed to avenge him by slaying the Ramlak. =Elephants= Exclusive to the 2011 series, the Elephants are a giant grey-skinned race brought to Third Earth when the black pyramid fell alongside the other Animals that Mumm-Ra enslaved. A normally passive race that rarely fights, the Elephants are spiritualists who don't have much of a good memory and can speak in an Indian accent. When the ThunderCats encounter their colony while on their search for the Warstones, the Elephants reveal that they have one yet forgot the item's exact location in their village. After the ThunderCats returned from the Forest of Magi Ore, the Elephant village was attacked by Grune and his forces. The ThunderCats were able to save the village and its people from the Lizards occupation, with the Elephants later coming to conclusion to aid in fending off the invading forces. * Anet (voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson) ‚Äì Exclusive to the 2011 series, Anet is a member of the Elephants race and is an ally of the ThunderCats. Anet appears to be a high-ranking spiritual leader among the Elephants. After he and Lion-O meet, Anet personally instructs Lion-O in the use of \\"Sight Beyond Sight\\". Anet has the ability to see visions of the future, telling Lion-O of the betrayal yet unable to specify it to be the king's relationship to Cheetara. In \\"What Lies Above\\" Pt. 2, Anet and some of the Elephants were recruited by Wilykit and Wilykat into helping them fight Mumm-Ra and save Avista. Anet stated that they are doing this to repay Lion-O. * Aburn (voiced by Jim Meskimen) ‚Äì Exclusive to the 2011 series, Aburn is also a member of the Elephants race, and is an ally of the ThunderCats. Aburn is the first of the Elephants to speak with the ThunderCats, befriending Wilykit and her brother while overhearing the former playing her instrument. During \\"Into The Astral Plane\\" Grune held Aburn hostage in order to force the ThunderCats to surrender, prior to Tygra was able to slip away and save everyone using the ThunderTank. =Dogs= One of the many elements featured in the 2011 series that seems to have been \\"inspired\\" by the Wildstorm/DC Comics mini-series, the Dogs were a rival species to the Thunderians. Each of the Dogs are modeled after Doberman Pinschers, Pit bulls, jackals, wolves, foxes, Labrador Retrievers, Mastiffs, Bulldogs, Boxers, Sheepdogs, Spaniels, and other types of canines. Many of the Dogs have bitter feelings towards the Thunderians while some others lived in Thundera's slums as second class citizens prior to the city's fall. Normally living in the Dog City within the desert, the Dogs own a variety of ramshackle bazaars and bars. They also have a gladiatorial arena know colloquially as \\"The Pit\\" which is part of their justice system as criminals are made slaves (unless if the slaves were bought from someone else) to fight against each other in combat until they have either paid their debt with 100 wins or have died in battle. * Jorma (voiced by Corey Burton) ‚Äì A dog who is a resident of Thundera's slums. Jorma is a mechanic by nature who sold technology to Lion-O at his junk shop. After Thundera's fall, Jorma moved back to Dog City where he is later reunited with Lion-O and plays a role in directing the Thundercats to Avista. * Dobo (voiced by Fred Tatasciore) ‚Äì Bearing an uncanny similarity to the Doberlord character featured in the Wildstorm/DC Comics mini-series, Dobo is a Doberman Pinscher- type dog who was originally a thief prior to the series. Dobo was paired with Panthro (a prisoner of war at the time) to earn his freedom from The Pit. Though the two were a powerful team, Dobo soon finds himself on his own when Panthro managed to escape. Earning his freedom, Dodo succeeded his predecessor and became the new Pit Master while having somewhat forgiving his friend and developing an idea to trust no one. Crossing paths with Panthro while having acquired Pumyra from the Rats, Dobo took offense to Lion-O's attempt to free his property locking him in the nearby cell with intent to put him again Pumyra while confiscating the Sword of Omens. Panthro was not pleased with Dobo's actions as Dobo tells him that Lion-O will go free if he defeats Pumyra. During Lion-O's fight with Pumyra, Panthro reveals that he escaped the Pit after learning he was to fight Dobo and did not want to forcefully kill him. When Pumyra is unable to finish off Lion-O, Dobo states that the penalty for forfeit is death. The crowd then chants for Dobo to spare her and Lion-O. Dobo then gives Lion-O and Pumyra their freedom. In \\"What Lies Above\\" Pt. 2, Dobo is among the Dogs that helps Wilykit and Wilykat to help to fight Mumm-Ra and save Avista. He does manage to knock down Pumyra before she and Mumm-Ra retreat with Mumm-Ra's forces. * Dog Constable (voiced by Jim Meskimen) ‚Äì The Dog Constable is a Boxer who is a stern law enforcer in the City of Dogs and has had some run-ins with Tookit. He is very tough and holds the law up in high standards and will arrest anyone who has broken the law no matter how old they are. The Dog Constable eventually learns that Tookit has been manipulating some orphans to do his dirty work upon overhearing Wilykit and Wilykat standing up to him. Although Tookit made a run for it, the Dog Constable gave chase and caught him when Wilykit and Wilykat had switched the Forever Bag with the real bag. The Dog Constable ended up remanding Tookit to The Pit. =Birds= Exclusive to the 2011 series, the Birdmen are a species of humanoid birds brought to Third Earth when the black pyramid fell alongside the other Animals that Mumm-Ra enslaved. They are the most culturally, artistically, and technologically advanced race on Third Earth, living in a democratic style of society in the treetop Bird Nation, as well as the majestic city in the sky Avista. They are fair, hospitable, and generous, but they are also arrogant, believing that the other Animals are primitive and unsophisticated, and thus not worthy of their spare time. Technology provides for their every practical need, but they can also fly under their own natural wing power. Like the Dogs and the Fishmen, the Birds have many diverse sub- species such as birds of prey, crows, ravens, pigeons, parrots, geese, magpies, storks, ducks, pelicans, macaws, cockatoos, mockingbirds, catbirds, doves, cranes, and many more. Addicus the Monkey committed vile crimes against the less-technological Bird Nation where was caught and sentenced to death only to be saved at the last moment by Slithe the Lizard. He then proceeded to murder and eat the Birds present offscreen at his intended execution as he was promised a \\"last meal.\\" Later, when Lion-O fracked the Tech Stone to Avista with the other ThunderCats, he was arrogantly brushed off by their perfect Vultaire. After the Cats failed to get the Stone following an unfair racing challenge in the air, they tracked the Stone themselves to the core power chamber of Avista. However, they were caught and sentenced to be \\"thrown out with the trash\\" by Vultaire, literally until Mumm-Ra came with his Lizards to steal the Tech Stone. The Cats were allowed to help the Avistans defend the city. The Ravenmen and Vultaire defended the skies as best they could, but the superior fighting skills of the Lizards and the destructive power of Mumm-Ra soon decimated the fleet causing Vultaire to defect to Mumm-Ra's side. After Mumm-Ra stole the Tech Stone, the city began to fall, due to the Stone generating anti-gravity emissions, but after Mumm-Ra and the Lizards evacuated, Panthro managed to land the city safely and saved the lives of most of the Avistans, who were grateful to the ThunderCats for saving them. Cheetara promised them that the equally technologically-talented Berbils would repair their city and return it to the sky. * Horus ‚Äì Horus is a pigeon-like Bird of Avista. Apparently, he's an aristocrat of the city as well as Vultaire's attach√©. Horus stays by the Vultaire's side much of the time. He went along with Vultaire's arrogant attitude and opposition to the ThunderCats until Mumm-Ra invaded Avista and the Cats helped them defend it. Horus participated in the defense of Avista and he did not follow Vultaire's footsteps when the latter treacherously defected to Mumm-Ra's side. His fate after the battle and the fall of Avista is unknown, but it is likely that he survived and allied with the Cats along with the other Avistans. * Raven Men ‚Äì The Raven Men are the elite military of Avista. Armed with electric shock spears and dressed in red uniforms and steel helmets, they are highly intelligent, like real ravens and have advanced military knowledge, more so than the Lizards possibly, although the Lizards took advantage of their easy- to-shoot-down flight formations. Their SkyCutter squadrons are named after birds of prey like ospreys and kestrels. They were initially antagonists to the ThunderCats, treating them like prisoners and trespassers, but later, when the ThunderCats proved to be better leaders and defenders than their treacherous prefect, the Ravens followed the Cats' lead, especially Tygra's. A substantially large number of Ravenmen and SkyCutters were destroyed by Lizard warships and Mumm-Ra's power, but some may possibly have survived Avista's downfall and allied themselves with the ThunderCats. =Other Third Earth Races= The following races were also featured throughout the series: * Brute-Men ‚Äì A tribe of unintelligent humanoid bovine-like creatures. They were once enslaved by the Mutants to build Castle Plun-Darr. * Cavemen ‚Äì A race of primitives that live on Third Earth. In \\"The Time Capsule,\\" Lion-O had to arm wrestle a caveman in order to claim a Thunderan Time Capsule. * Crabmen ‚Äì A race of humanoid crabs that live on Third Earth. They reside on the beaches and are very territorial. * Feerits ‚Äì The Feerits are a tribe of humanoids that live along the river. They are known to attack any foreign lifeform that comes near their territory. In \\"Lion-O's Anointment Day: The Trial of Speed,\\" Lion-O had an encounter with the Feerits. * Gargoyles ‚Äì The Gargoyles of Third Earth resemble winged demon-like humanoids that are made of stone. They are often used as guardians and servants for certain powerful figures. In \\"The Tower of Traps,\\" a bunch of Gargoyles resided in the Black Tower where they have served the late Baron Karnor into stealing from the inhabitants of Third Earth while terrorizing them. These Gargoyles were destroyed by the ThunderCats. In \\"The Sound Stones,\\" two Gargoyles work for Sondora and help her to guard the Sound Stones. * Giants ‚Äì The Giants of Third Earth are large human-like beings. They live in a cliffside area next door to a group of trolls as seen in \\"All That Glitters.\\" * Giantors ‚Äì The Giantors are a race of large ogre-like creatures that live at the top of the mountains. They force the Trollogs into hunting the Berbils' candy fruit crops. After Lion-O had fended off the Trollogs, the Giantors had to come to the Berbil village themselves. Lion-O called for the other ThunderCats and they were able to drive away from the Giantors. In the 2011 series, the Giantors still have the Trollogs work for them, but also buy some slave captured by the Conquedor. After Lion-O freed the slaves, Conqueror led the Giantors and the Trollogs into recapturing the Berbils. With help from the Berbils, the ThunderCats were able to drive away Conqueror, the Giantors, and the Trollogs. * Kymeras ‚Äì A race of robot-like aliens that terrorize the Terators. * Mermaids ‚Äì A race of half-human half-fish creatures. In \\"Turmagar the Tuska,\\" Tygra falls into the spell of a Vampire Mermaid. * Micrits ‚Äì A race of tiny humans that live near the Cats' Lair. They are farmers by trade and live in primitive huts. In \\"The Micrits,\\" the Micrits' village had been run-over by the Thunder Tank. When Lion-O later came near their village, the Micrits tied Lion-O up with rope made with Thundranium. Snarf later had to offer himself to them so that Lion-O can help fight off the Mutants. To prevent any further destruction of the Micrit's village, the ThunderCats put up signs around their village to let anyone who passes by know that the Micrits live here. In ThunderCats Roar, the Micrits are led by Emperor Toadius (voiced by Steve Blum) who has a son named Prince Starling (voiced by Cedric L. Williams). * Molemen ‚Äì A race of small humanoid moles that live underground. They aren't too friendly even to those who rescue them. Some of the Molemen were enslaved by Molemaster until Tygra defeated him. * Mudhogs ‚Äì A race of humanoid common warthogs that live underground and are easily blinded by bright lights. They once captured Quick Pick and Mandora planning to feed them to a giant bird. In the nick of time, Lion-O and the other ThunderCats arrived to save Mandora and Quick Pick where the Thunder-Tank's lights drove away from the Mudhogs. * Petalars ‚Äì Exclusive to the 2011 series, the Petalars are a race of small flower people that have a very short lifespan that lasts only one day. However, the Petalars' sense of time differs from that of other races, so hours seem like years to them. A Petalar named Emrick (voiced by Atticus Shaffer as a child, Patrick Cavanaugh as an adult, James Arnold Taylor like an old man) taught him the value of life before passing away. * Snowmen - A race of Yeti-like creatures that reside on Hook Mountain. They are a savage and proud race. * Terators ‚Äì A race of aliens whose homeworld was destroyed by the Kymeras. * Trolls ‚Äì The Trolls of Third Earth are small creatures that are similar in appearance to the Bolkins and the Wolos. The Trolls are known to ride Hoppers. They live in a cliffside area next door to a group of Giants. In \\"All That Glitters,\\" Mumm-Ra once assumed the form of Grygory Grygion in order to trick Lion-O into attacking Tygra which would lead to the Sword of Omens getting broken. * Trollogs ‚Äì A race of humanoid Bulldogs that live in the caves that are north of the Berbil Village. They are forced by the Giantors to raid the Berbils' candy crops. When Lion-O fought off the Trollogs, the Giantors did not take the news of this lightly and went to the Berbil Village themselves. In the 2011 TV series, the Trollogs are shown with the Giantors into buying slaves from Conquedor. After Lion-O freed the slaves, Conquedor led the Trollogs and the Giantors into attacking the Berbil Village. With help from the Berbils, the ThunderCats managed to fend off Conquedor, the Trollogs, and the Giantors. * Tuskas - A race of humanoid walruses. * Under-Earthmen ‚Äì The Under-Earthmen are a group of people that live deep underground. They are feared for the knowledge contained within their many books, which they guard fiercely despite years of confinement below ground having robbed them of the ability to read them. In \\"Lion-O's Anointment Third Day: Trial of Cunning,\\" Lion-O encountered the Under-Earthmen during his test held by Wilykit and Wilykat. Allies of Third EarthCaptain Bragg & Crownan= Captain Bragg (voiced by Bob McFadden) is an intergalactic ringmaster and bounty hunter who pilots a train-like spaceship called the Circus Train which he transports his captives to Wayout Back. Captain Bragg traveled to Third Earth and befriended Wilykat. Part huckster and part showman, Bragg uses his showmanship to capture both the Mutants and the Lunataks when they were transported to him by the Ancient Spirits of Evil following Mumm-Ra's failure in an ultimatum battle against Lion-O. Although a bit of a bungler in nature, Bragg becomes an ally of the ThunderCats and calls upon their assistance in subsequent appearances. On one occasion, he even attempts to flirt with Mandora the Evil-Chaser without much success. Crownan 'Crownan is a talking crow who is Captain Bragg's wisecracking sidekick. =Dr. Dometome= Dr. Dometome (voiced by Bob McFadden in the original series, Trevor Devall in the 2020 series) is one of Third Earth's great thinkers, scientists, and gentlemen. He is the chief protector of the Great Oceanic Plug (a massive engineering project built to seal a crack in the ocean floor to prevent the planet's oceans from flooding its core). He is a small man but very chivalrous and a skilled pilot of Hercules (aka \\"Herky\\"), a giant frog-shaped robot used to guard the sea floor. =Hachiman= Hachiman (voiced by Peter Newman) is a samurai warrior and master swordsman from Ancient Japan. Summoned to Third Earth by Mumm-Ra, he was tricked into fighting Lion-O, but thanks to his code of Bushido, he became an ally to the ThunderCats and the Warrior Maidens of the Tree-Top Kingdom. He wields a sword known as ‚ÄúThe Thunder-Cutter,‚Äù a katana-blade that, with his skill, can cut through solid stone. Hachiman has saved the lives of various ThunderCats on multiple occasions. Hachiman maintains a friendship with Lion-O after they first join forces. During the race to rescue Pumyra, Ben-Gali, and Lynx-O during ThunderCats- HO!, he is again briefly tricked into attacking the ThunderCats‚Äîspecifically Lion-O‚Äîby Mumm-Ra. However, he eventually realizes that he has again been deceived and sides with the ThunderCats once more. In his final appearance, Hachiman is shown to be living on his own planet which resembles ancient Japan. =Mandora= Mandora (voiced by Lynne Lipton in the original series, Erica Lindbeck in the 2020 series) is an intergalactic police officer, who works in conjunction with a series of law enforcers to protect the peaceful people of the galaxy. She works in part to run the Great Penal Planet‚Äîwhich houses some of the galaxy's nastiest criminals‚Äîand routinely comes to Third Earth as part of her patrols. When one of these criminals, a robotic pickpocket named Quick Pick, helps her and Lion-O against Captain Cracker, she makes him an Evil Chaser assistant. She travels on a specially equipped hoverbike called the Electro-Charger and uses a weapon called the ‚Äúenzyme catalyzer\\"‚Äîa spray gun loaded with a chemical that she describes as follows: \\"An ancient formula, now a closely guarded secret. It used to be called soap.\\" After the Mutants and the Lunataks are removed from Third Earth, Mandora becomes a member of the League of Third-Earth. Mandora appears in ThunderCats Roar. She is shown to be annoyed with Lion-O's oafish antics when it comes to him accidentally letting the bad guys she's after escape. =Mumm- Rana= Mumm-Rana (voiced by Lynne Lipton in the original series, Kaitlyn Robrock in the 2020 series) is an ancient sorceress for good and counterpart to Mumm-Ra. She lives in the White Pyramid where her powers (apparently bestowed upon her by \\"the Ancient Spirits of Goodness\\" whom she invokes in her very first appearance) keep her from traveling too far. She at one time battled Queen Luna (grandmother to the Lunatak Luna) to stop her rampage across Third Earth. She did so by stripping Queen Luna of her magical belt which she later lost to Luna (it was destroyed eventually). Much like Mumm-Ra, her powers limit the time she can spend outside of her pyramid home. Mumm- Rana's level of power is somewhat unclear, as she was seen to be bested in battle by Mumm-Ra in the first appearance (he used a spell to trick Mumm-Rana into thinking that the ThunderCats are evil), but she was also shown to be considerably more powerful than both Queen and Princess Luna, as she defeated both of them with relatively little effort. In ThunderCats Roar, Mumm-Rana is first seen in \\"Snarf's Day Off\\" posing as an old lady named Mrs. Gristildi who a disguised Snarf poses as. When at the craft fair, Mrs. Gristildi has some competition from a disguised Mumm-Ra. After Snarf's disguise was exposed when fighting Mumm-Ra, this caused Mumm-Rana to shed her disguise and beat up Mumm- Ra for ruining her day. With both of them now knowing each other's secrets, Mumm-Rana and Snarf put together a calendar consisting of picture showing Mumm-Ra being beaten up. =Snowman= The Snowman of Hook Mountain (voiced by Earl Hammond in the original series, Dave B. Mitchell in the 2020 series) is a yeti-like chivalrous knight, who rules over the Kingdom of the Snowmen on the frigid heights of Hook Mountain. He once tried to fight Lion-O for possession of a meteor that fell onto the slopes of his mountain kingdom, but they became friends after Lion-O rescued him from a Mutant attack. He can craft weapons out of ice, seemingly at will. After the Mutants and the Lunataks were removed from Third Earth, Snowman becomes a member of the League of Third Earth. Snowmeow Snowmeow is the Snowman's great snow cat who serves as his mount. He tends to act as a messenger to the ThunderCats when warning them about the dangers that threaten the Snowmen. In the 2011 series, Snowmeow had a small cameo in the ninth episode \\"Berbils.\\" Snowmeow was one of the wonders being auctioned off by the Conqueror. He was described as coming \\"straight from Hook Mountain,\\" implying his origins were largely the same as the original. =Sondora= Sondora (voiced by Gerrianne Raphael) is the Keeper of the Mystical Soundstones, she assists the ThunderCats when Vultureman steals one of her stones to create a sonic weapon for the Lunataks. After Lion-O recovers the stolen Soundstone, Sondora decides to take the stones to another dimension. But she promises the ThunderCats that she would be there to help them if they ever required her assistance. =Turmagar= Turmagar (voiced by Earl Hammond) is the leader of the walrus-like Tuska Warriors who live near the source of the river that serves as Third Earth's natural water supply. Very skilled as a warrior and leader, Turmagar is also a crafty pilot who flies the Gomplin. It is Turmagar who often helps the ThunderCats with air support before they crafted their own air-vehicles. It is worth noting that the Tuska Warriors are among the few factions in the series to employ firearms as opposed to melee weapons and/or bows and arrows. In his self-titled episode, Turmagar comes to the ThunderCats for help against the Technopede. In \\"Catfight,\\" Mumm-Ra disguised himself as Turmagar in order to incite in- fighting between the original ThunderCats and the new ones. =Unicorn Keepers= The Unicorn Keepers are two unknown humanoids that serve as the caretakers of the Unicorn Forest where they look over the forest's unicorns. Although the male Unicorn Keeper (voiced by Bob McFadden) and the female Unicorn Keeper (voiced by Lynne Lipton) are married, they are never referred to by their real name. They first appeared in \\"The Terror of Hammerhand\\" where they befriend the ThunderCats upon them coming to their aid when Hammerhand and his pirates have been poaching the unicorns. In \\"The Time Capsule,\\" the female Unicorn Keeper tells Lion-O of the Black Widow Shark that dwells in the River of Despair. She uses a crystal that forms the Bridge of Light that enables Lion-O to cross the River of Despair. In \\"Snarf Takes up the Challenge,\\" the female Unicorn Keeper and Robear Bill tell Snarf that the other ThunderCats have been captured by the Mutants and have been handed over to Mumm-Ra. =Wizz-Ra= Wizz-Ra (voiced by Larry Kenney) is a powerful wizard from ancient Egypt. He lost a battle to Mumm-Ra who framed him for damaging the face of the Great Sphinx which banished Wizz-Ra to the 7th Dimension. His helmet has the ability of mind-control and is sought by Mumm-Ra after it is discovered that the wall of the 7th Dimension is weak enough (after 7,000 years) for him to appear in Cheetara's bedchamber. He aids the ThunderCats after they help him to recover his helmet, and then is forced to return to the 7th Dimension. Before departing, Wizz-Ra promising Cheetara they would meet again in her dreams. Allies of New ThunderaChar= Char (voiced by Bob McFadden) is a four-armed alien garbage scavenger and blacksmith who encounters Snarf as he was trying to bring the damaged pieces of the Sword of Omens back to Ben-Gali. Char wants the sword for himself, but Snarf tricks him into repairing it which causes the sword to mystically return to Lion-O. Char later apologizes for his actions and becomes an ally of the ThunderCats. In \\"The Heritage,\\" Char and the ThunderKittens WilyKit and WilyKat fall under the evil influence of an evil golden orb which in reality is Mumm-Ra's lost Sphere of Setti. =Screwloose= Screwloose is a bungling robot whom the ThunderCats enlist to assist Jagara in the repair of the Gyroscope. Mumm-Ra replaces Screwloose's brain module with one of his own creation, causing the robot to alternate between good and evil behavior. After he tries to destroy the gyroscope and kill Jagara, Lion-O uses the Sword of Omens to restore Screwloose. During the ensuing battle with Mumm-Ra, Screwloose actually defeats him by taking the Sword of Plun-Darr. In the end, Screwloose remains behind on New Thundera to help Jagara maintain the gyroscope. AntagonistsMumm-Ra= Mumm-Ra (voiced by Earl Hammond in the original series, Robin Atkin Downes in the 2011 series, Patrick Seitz in the 2020 series) is the chief villain and antagonist of the ThunderCats, the demon-priest Mumm-Ra is the self-proclaimed \\"ever-living source of evil\\" on Third Earth, having powers of sorcery and an apparently unlimited lifespan. He is, in fact, a servant to the Ancient Spirits of Evil who provide him with increased power and virtual immortality to further his pursuit of spreading their dark influence throughout Third Earth. Residing within the Black Pyramid amid the ruins of what appears to be an ancient Egyptian civilization, Mumm-Ra exists in a decayed, weakened mummified form that must return to a stone sarcophagus to replenish his energy. He can transform himself into a far more vigorous and muscular form‚ÄîMumm-Ra, the Ever-Living‚Äîby reciting the incantation: \\"Ancient Spirits of Evil, transform this decayed form... to Mumm- Ra, the Ever-Living!\\" While in this form, Mumm-Ra possesses fortification of his mystical might‚Äîcasting spells, throwing energy bolts, etc.‚Äîto battle his foes. He can also alter his physical form into a variety of alter-egos to deceive his enemies. Seemingly invincible in whatever form he chooses, Mumm-Ra appears to have a singular weakness: seeing his own hideous reflection neutralizes his ability to remain outside the Black Pyramid and forces him to withdraw there in his emaciated mummy form. However, at the beginning of the second season, the Ancient Spirits of Evil revoked this shortcoming. Mumm-Ra is a master of deception and will use whatever means necessary to fight against the forces of good. In later episodes, while endowing Mumm-Ra with his powers, the statues of the Ancient Spirits of Evil came down from their perches to extend their arms over him. In addition, Mumm-Ra has the ability to shapeshift, which he uses to create disguises and deceive the ThunderCats on various occasions. Among these are Diamondfly (in the episode \\"Queen of Eight Legs\\"), Gregory Gregion (\\"All That Glitters\\"), Silky (\\"The Garden of Delights\\"), The Netherwitch (\\"The Astral Prison\\"), and Pumm-Ra (in the episode \\"Pumm-Ra\\"). He once took the form of King Arthur to acquire the legendary magic sword Excalibur, using it against the Sword of Omens. In a few episodes, Mumm-Ra has an even more powerful form beyond \\"Mumm-Ra the Ever-Living\\" called \\"Mumm-Ra the All-Powerful\\". In this manifestation, Mumm-Ra absorbs the entire power of the Ancient Spirits of Evil to become grander in size and strength, and the design pattern on his loincloth changes, as does his voice. This form is only presented in the series three times. In another incarnation, invoking \\"the Ancient Spirits of the Dream World\\" to transform himself into \\"Mumm-Ra the Dream Master\\", he is able to enter dreams to subliminally influence the ThunderCats in their sleep as a form of mind control. Mumm-Ra is regarded as immortal, and when defeated, he simply returns to his sarcophagus. Mumm-Ra cannot be truly killed; even in cases where his body is destroyed, he will eventually be restored, as he often states: \\"Wherever evil exists, Mumm-Ra lives!\\" In later episodes, when the Ancient Spirits of Evil were increasingly disappointed with Mumm-Ra's repeated failures, they demanded he destroys the ThunderCats or else he would be forcefully removed. They dimensionally banish Ma-Mutt as an example. When Mumm-Ra fails, the Ancient Spirits of Evil trap him within a planar crystal and cast him away from Third Earth. When the ThunderCats decide to colonize New Thundera to rebuild it, the Ancient Spirits of Evil free Mumm-Ra and rebuild his pyramid there. In \\"The Heritage,\\" it was said that Mumm-Ra once owned the Sphere of Seti which increased his power. When he managed to recover it after it was found by Char, he planned to use it to increase his power and free himself from servitude to Ancient Spirits of Evil. Figuring out Mumm-Ra's plan, the Ancient Spirits of Evil cut off his transformation chant and demanded he surrender the Sphere of Setti to them. Angered at his plot as well as at his deceptive attempts to hide it, the Ancient Spirits of Evil seal off the Black Pyramid, forcing Mumm-Ra to choose between sustenance (the pyramid) or power (the sphere). Ultimately, Mumm-Ra admits that he cannot survive without the pyramid‚Äîthus he begrudgingly surrenders the Sphere of Setti to them. In the 2011 version, Mumm-Ra is an Ancient Spirit of Evil employed by the Ancient Spirits of Evil (confirmed by series Art Director Dan Norton) with changes including demon wings on his Ever-Living form, a larger body, and a weakness to intensely bright light. His ultimate goal is universal domination and enforcing his ideal order on it. Centuries prior to the new series, Mumm-Ra used advanced technology and magic at his disposal to enslave the ancestors of the ThunderCats and the Animals into serving him so he would gather the Four Powerstones from various planets to place on the Sword of Plun-Darr, a weapon forged from a star he had collapsed at the cost of the entire Plun-Darr galaxy. But managing to take the Warstone (which would become the Eye of Thundera) while staging a rebellion with the Animals' help, the ThunderCat Leo defeats Mumm-Ra and strips him of the other Powerstones. But when Mumm-Ra's pyramid spacecraft was pulled into Third Earth's atmosphere, Mumm-Ra entered his tomb to bide his time for everyone else to die in the resulting crash. However, the controls were smashed and Mumm-Ra was trapped within his pyramid as the stones and survivors spread across Third Earth. However, many centuries later, Mumm-Ra used Grune to release him from his prison and masterminded Thundera's downfall. With the aid of Grune and Slythe, Mumm-Ra not only plans to obtain the Eye of Thundera, but to regain the other three Powerstones in order to get to the Sword of Plundarr and the remaining stones. Mumm-Ra also resurrected Pumyra to serve him and planted her amongst the Thunderian slaves. After Grune ends up trapped in the Astral Plane, Mumm-Ra has Slithe recruit the homicidal Addicus and sociopathic Kaynar to not only restore the Lizard army morale and punish any who quit but also increase their numbers with members of the new generals' respective races. Later, through a calculated scheme involving his agent Pumyra, Mumm-Ra regains the Sword of Plun-Darr and the Tech Stone while gaining a new ally in Vultaire. In ThunderCats Roar, Mumm-Ra had his Mumm-Ra the Ever-Living form when he wielded a Doom Staff. It was broken by the ThunderCats in their first battle. Mumm-Ra went through different artifacts to regain this form until he recalled that he has the Ancient Spirits of Evil. Ma-Mutt Ma-Mutt is a demonic Bulldog that is Mumm-Ra's pet. While incapable of speech because of his canine physiology, he appears to be a sapient being of roughly human intelligence. Ma-Mutt has demonstrated the ability to fly as well as to grow in size and seems to have greatly enhanced strength. Ma-Mutt also harnesses the same shape-shifting capabilities as Mumm- Ra. =Ancient Spirits of Evil= The Ancient Spirits of Evil (voiced by Earle Hyman in the original series, Jim Cummings and Kevin Michael Richardson in the 2011 series, Chris Jai Alex in the 2020 series) are four dark spirits summoned by Mumm-Ra, who represents the incarnation of malicious evil. They are both the source of Mumm-Ra's powers and his eternal masters. They communicate with him through the cauldron and giant anthropomorphic statues of a boar, vulture, crocodile, and ox. The Ancient Spirits of Evil often provide Mumm-Ra with a source of knowledge of ancient or magical events. They are, however, incapable of interacting with the physical realm outside of the Black Pyramid and thus must rely on Mumm-Ra (or other beings) to serve as avatars of their power or enact their influence accordingly. In the episode \\"Doomgaze,\\" it is hinted that the Ancient Spirits of Evil are of the same race as H. P. Lovecraft's Great Old Ones, because Mumm-Ra invokes Yog-Sothoth and Cthulhu when freeing the evil Princess Ta-She from her time prison. In the 2011 version, the statues of the Ancient Spirits of Evil that are in Mumm-Ra's chamber are made to resemble a lizard, a jackal, a monkey, and a vulture. The Ancient Spirits played a role in the creation of both the Sword of Plun-Darr, possessing a Thunderian blacksmith to forge the weapon, and the Sword of Omens, due to the blacksmith retaining the spirits' knowledge to forge a weapon similar to the previous creation. In \\"Native Son,\\" it is revealed that the Ancient Spirits have been worshiped by the Tiger Clan after their ancestors were driven off to the mountains due to their loyalty to Mumm-Ra. When the Tiger Clan was on the verge of dying out from an epidemic, the spirits offer to cure them in return that the newborn Tygra (who would grow up to become an enemy to Mumm-Ra and themselves) be sacrificed. When Javan refused to honor his end of the pact, the Ancient Spirits bound the souls of the Tiger Clan to the living world as shape-shifting shadow monsters that obey their every command. Some years later, a fully-grown Tygra found his way back to his ancestral home and freed his kin of the curse. In a sense of irony, Tigra only became the threat they foresaw by ordering his death. In ThunderCats Roar, the Ancient Spirits of Evil were revealed to have been unplugged by Mumm-Ra in the episode \\"Mumm-Ra the Ever Living\\" when they speak to him. They get annoyed with the ThunderCats when they make strange demands to them. In \\"Mumm-Ra of Plun-Darr,\\" the Ancient Spirits of Evil tip off Mumm-Ra that the Sword of Plun-Darr is coming out of Third Earth's orbit. =The Mutants= The Mutants are creatures who are the first villains seen in the series, originating from the planet Plun-Darr. They are the long-time enemies of the Thunderians. Later in the series, it is revealed that events that stemmed from their unsuccessful invasion of Thundera ultimately led to the destruction of that planet. Not content to see the Thunderians lose their homeworld, the Mutants chased after the survivors, using their spaceships to devastate the Thunderian fleet and seeming to destroy the majority of the doomed planet's escaping populace. They then boarded the flagship (which carried the ThunderCat nobles, Jaga the Wise, and the young Lion-O) in attempting to capture the Eye of Thundera. They were repelled and retreated to later relocate the crashed flagship on Third Earth. It was here that Mumm-Ra's power grounded the Mutant ship, and they were forced to follow his demands once he sank their vessel beneath the desert sands. Though they exhibited an extraordinary incompetence that was characteristic of most cartoon villains, the Mutants managed to construct their own fortress, which they called Castle Plun-Darr after their homeworld, and salvage equipment from their downed spaceship to build weapons and vehicles that they could use on Third Earth (e.g., the Skycutters, the Nosediver, etc.). There was an inconsistency in how many mutants were actually on Third Earth as some episodes had a small army guarding Castle Plun-Darr. But in most episodes, only Slithe, Monkian, Jackalman, and Vultureman, who appeared shortly after the initial few episodes as he was not present during the attack on the Thunderian flagship, were seen. They would later be joined by Rataro, a general in the mutant armies who possessed magical weapons of his own, and who was generally more competent than the primary four mutants, though he was no more successful against the Thundercats than the other mutants were. In the 2011 series, the Mutants are referred to as \\"Animals\\" which their surviving ancestors brought to Third Earth after aiding Lion-O's ancestor Leo in defeating Mumm-Ra. However, while four of the races obtain a stone that made them each a power, the other animals were ultimately outmatched by the Cats and pitted against each other until the Lizards managed to salvage lost technology and ransacked Thundera with help from Mumm-Ra and Grune. Besides the lizards, the jackals, the monkeys, the birds (sorted into the Bird Nation and the Avistans), and the Rats, among the animal types presented in the reboot are the Dogs, the peaceful Elephants, the Fishmen, aquatic creatures that resemble the TigerSharks, and a character that looks like Mon*Star from SilverHawks. In the 2020 series, the Mutants' roles are similar to the 1985 series where Ratar-O was depicted as their leader. Slithe Slithe/Slythe (voiced by Bob McFadden in the 1985 series, Dee Bradley Baker in the 2011 series, Trevor Devall in the 2020 series) is the brutish leader of the Reptilians (referred to as Lizards in 2011 series), a race of Lizard Men. Although he lacks sophistication, his intuitive cunning is considerable. Domineering and impatient, Slithe often must browbeat the other Mutants into going along with his plans. Unlike Jackalman and Monkian (whose appearances are identical to other mutants of their kind), Slithe stands out from other Reptilians because of his ears and broader build. He pilots the Nosediver. Slithe served as Rataro's cook earlier in his career, and he retains a discriminating palate. In the 2011 series, though a descendant of the Lizards that were enslaved by him, Slithe serves Mumm-Ra in order for his kind to take revenge on the Thunderians for generations of persecution. The Lizards have been at war with the Thunderians during their history. Succeeding in ransacking Thundera, Slithe pursues Lion-O's group before overseeing the search for the Book of Omens and later the War Stones. When it came to the attack on the Elephants' village while Mumm-Ra was in the Astral Plane, Slithe and Grune disobey Mumm-Ra's orders and attacked the village. In \\"Legacy,\\" it was revealed that a Lizard named Rezard (voiced by Rob Paulsen) assisted Leo and Panthera into overthrowing Mumm-Ra. In \\"New Alliances,\\" some of the Lizards that worked for Slithe have been deserting Mumm-Ra causing Slithe to prosecute any that he catches. Slithe is also instructed by Mumm-Ra to recruit Kaynar and Addicus to Mumm-Ra's services. He was renamed \\"Rept√≠lio\\" in the Spanish version, and \\"Escamoso\\" in the Brazilian version. =Khamai= Khamai (voiced by James Arnold Taylor) is a chameleon-like lizard who is exclusive to the 2011 TV series. He leads a special squad of Lizards and works closely with Slithe. Khamai is killed by Lion-O. =Kask= Kask (voiced by Matthew Mercer) is a Lizard who is exclusive to the 2011 TV series. He served as Slithe's scout lieutenant. =Sauro= Sauro (voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson) is a Lizard who is exclusive to the 2011 TV series. He is Slithe's scout. Jackalman Jackalman (voiced by Larry Kenney in the 1985 series, Dee Bradley Baker in the 2011 series, Andrew Kishino in the 2020 series) is a cautious and distrustful coward who leads the Jackalmen, a race of humanoid jackals. Though he is one to take any advantage presented to him, Jackalman often sides with Slythe to keep from being the scapegoat when plans fail. He also pilots a Skycutter. In the 2011 series, though Slythe called him a \\"Jackalman\\", his real name is Kaynar. A deranged psychopath who was about to be placed in solitary confinement within a Dog prison, Kaynar is recruited by Slithe to be one of Mumm-Ra's new generals. Though preferring his cell, Kaynar accepts Slithe's proposal when he mentions that he can slaughter ThunderCats while allowed to \\"say goodbye\\" to his jailers. Prior to his debut, Kaynar's kind was seen in the episode \\"Legacy.\\" During that time, a Jackalman named Shen (voiced by Rob Paulsen) assisted Leo and Panthera in overthrowing Mumm- Ra. He was renamed \\"Chacalo\\" in the Spanish version. Monkian Monkian (voiced by Peter Newman in the 1985 series, Robin Atkin Downes in the 2011 series, Jim Meskimen in the 2020 series) is a shifty no-good eavesdropper who is the excitable leader of the Simians (referred to as Monkeys in the 2011 series), a race of ape men. He often plays the role of scout for the Mutants and is frequently the first to run from danger. Monkian typically uses his flail and projectile-firing shield when in combat. He pilots one of the Skycutters. In the 2011 series, though Slythe called him a \\"Monkian\\", his real name is Addicus. Addicus is a bloodthirsty barbarian who committed crimes against the Bird Nation and was sentenced to a death drop from high up in his captors' domain. However, Addicus is rescued from the fall by Slithe and recruited to be one of Mumm-Ra's new generals. Accepting the proposal, Addicus is allowed to get his revenge on the Bird Nation as Addicus states that they \\"owe him a last meal.\\" He was renamed \\"Mandrilo\\" in the Spanish version. Vultureman Vultureman (voiced by Earl Hammond in the 1985 series, Michael McKean in the 2011 series, Dana Snyder in the 2020 series) is a crafty, vulture-like opportunist who serves as chief inventor and mechanical know-it-all for the Mutants. His skills with both machines and science make him frequently indispensable, but he is more often than not blamed when his devices or machines fail to live up to Slithe's expectations (In one episode, he grew tired of this and activated a hidden self-destruct mechanism in every single machine and vehicle the Mutants used, telling them that if his work was really so bad, then \\"See how you do without them!\\"). As befits a scientist, Vultureman is inquisitive and open-minded, frequently leaving him odd-man-out among his more barbaric peers. Much later, he decides to work for his own gains, and he often strikes solo deals with Mumm-Ra. He pilots a vulture- styled Flying Machine carries a crossbow-shaped weapon, and later commands weapons like the Mutank and Thundrainium Cannon. Unlike the other mutants, Vultureman was not introduced in the opening episode of the series, but a flashback reveals him working with Slithe years earlier. In the 2011 series, he is renamed Vultaire and is a prefect of Avista (a floating futuristic city in the sky). Like the other birds in this series, Vultaire is shown with wings on his back (where the 80's version didn't have wings). Vultaire's ancestors were entrusted with the Tech Stone by Leo and used it to build Avista with the stone's power keeping Avista afloat. Like many of his kind, Vultaire is arrogant and sees himself above those who live on the land, especially the ThunderCats whom he considers to be manipulative barbarians. When the ThunderCats arrive to Avista for the Tech Stone, Vultaire accepted Tigra's challenge for the item to obtain the two stones in his group's possession. But upon losing, Vultaire refuses to honor his end of the deal and places ThunderCats under house arrest. He was momentarily held hostage by Pumrya in order to gain access to the Tech Stone. However, Vultaire purposely left the security system active as it knocked out Pumyra while having his Ravenman guards escort the ThunderCats to be thrown out of Avista with the trash before Mumm-Ra's forces to make their move. Though aiding the ThunderCats in fighting off Mumm-Ra's army, Vultaire betrays his fellow Avistans and aligns himself with Mumm-Ra upon witnessing his power firsthand. Vultaire shoots down Tygra and then quotes to Addicus \\"the enemy of my enemy is my friend.\\" Vultaire joins Slithe, Kaynar, and Addicus into fighting Tygra, Panthro, and Cheetara prior to the latter knocking him out before Tygra can get payback for the bird's treachery. After Mumm-Ra claimed the Tech Stone, Vultaire joined Mumm- Ra's forces into retreating from Avista. He was renamed \\"Bu√≠tro\\" in the Spanish version. Ratar-O Ratar-O (voiced by Bob McFadden in the 1985 series, Carlo Rota in the 2011 series, Crispin Freeman in the 2020 series) is a rat-like general in the Mutant armies. This portly rodent is considered the most cunning and evil of all the Mutants. He comes to Third Earth at the behest of the Vultureman to aid them in defeating the ThunderCats. His flagship the Ratstar is a powerful war machine. Though it crashes, Ratar-O salvages parts to make a Mutank to continue the fight. He is strong and wields the Rat's Eye (a pair of kris-style daggers which have two mystical gems embedded in their hilts) that he can use to fire energy blasts, levitate foes and even fly through the air. Ratar-O is a descendant Ratilla the Terrible (the former holder of the Sword of Plun-Darr). In the 2011 series, Ratar-O is the dictator of the Rats, a descendant of Ratilla who found the Sword of Plun- Darr after the Animals ended up on Third Earth. While under Mumm-Ra's services, the Rats served as janitors within the Black Pyramid before ending up scavengers on Third Earth. Though Ratilla used the item to turn his people into a power equal to the ThunderCats, the Sword of Plun-Darr corrupted his mind before Jaga is forced to kill him in order to seal the weapon away in what becomes Mount Plun-Darr. As the weapon's whereabouts are unknown to Mumm- Ra, Ratar-O buys the Thunderian survivors from the Lizards to use as slaves to mine for the Sword of Plun-Darr and obtain it for him due to the curse Jaga placed on it that kills any who attempt to retrieve it. When the ThunderCats raid Mount Plun-Darr as Tygra and Cheetara pose as slaves to get the sword, Lion-O's group is captured by Mordax and turned over to Ratar-O. But once Tygra and Cheetara found the Sword of Plun-Darr, it caused much of Mount Plun- Darr to collapse with Ratar-O's palace destroyed in the process. Following the castle collapse, Ratar-O battles Lion-O who manages to defeat Ratar-O as he retreats underground. In the 2020 series, Ratar-O is depicted as the leader of the Mutants who fought Jaga wielding the Sword of Plun-Darr. At some point while in space, he does managed to reclaim the Sword of Plun-Darr some time after Thundera's destruction. When he arrives on Third Earth and gets Slithe, Jackalman, Monkian, and Vultureman on his side, Ratar-O fights the ThunderCats wielding the Sword of Omens. The ThunderCats defeat Ratar-O and throw the Sword of Plun-Darr into outer space. =Mordax= Mordax (voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson) is an eyepatch-wearing mouse who is exclusive to the 2011 series and Ratar-O's abused second-in-command. When the ThunderCats raid Mount Plun-Darr, Pumyra is prevented from killing Mordax by Lion-O wishing to show mercy rather than force. Though Mordax takes advantage of the act of kindness by taking Lion-O, Pumyra, and Panthro prisoner and hand them over to Ratar-O. Mordax later turn against Ratar-O, refusing to kill Lion-O and by returning the Sword of Omens to him before making his escape. =The Lunataks= Hailing from the Moons of Plun-Darr, the Lunataks are vile beings who have once feared criminals in ancient times. They dwell in Dark Side, a volcanic region on the far side of Fire-Rock Mountain. They were encased in molten rock by Mumm-Ra when they attempted to take control of the Third Earth. Mumm-Ra later had the Mutants release them on the condition that they work for him to battle the ThunderCats. However, the Lunataks instead form their own \\"third column\\" based in Dark Side where they build a massive floating fortress called Sky Tomb from which they strike against all of Third Earth. Their numbers consist of: * Luna (voiced by Lynne Lipton) ‚Äì A midget sorceress who is the leader and chief strategist of the Lunataks. Because of her small form, she is carried around and cared for by Amok. Cruel and caustic, Luna at one time recovered the magical belt once worn by her grandmother Queen Luna that was confiscated by Mumm-Rana and used its power to grow tall and mobile again, but reverted in size when the belt was later destroyed. * Amok (voiced by Earl Hammond) ‚Äì Luna's loyal servant and bodyguard who is also her chief mode of transportation. A hulking quadrupedal Bulldog/demon-like brute with very limited capacity for vocalization, Amok is strong and fast but also displays enough cunning to exact revenge against Luna for abandoning him when she recovers Queen Luna's magical belt. He also has an innate weakness for candies and will abandon Luna in an instant if it means getting to eat it. * Alluro (voiced by Doug Preis) ‚Äì An unspecified creature with a slimy and treacherous personality, Alluro is a master of deception, mind games, and psychological warfare. He is not much of a fighter, but he uses a powerful weapon called a Psyche-Club to immobilize his foes. The crystal ball launched from his club focuses his mental powers onto a foe, allowing him to manipulate their minds with illusions or to command them to do his bidding. Unlike the other Lunatak soldiers, no connection is ever made between Alluro's powers and any condition on his home-world moon that would necessitate having them. * Tug Mug (voiced by Bob McFadden) ‚Äì A Lunatak from one of Plun-Darr's moons with strong gravity, Tug Mug proves extremely powerful in the lesser gravity of Third Earth. He can use his tripod \\"legs\\" to leap great distances, and his strength is so impressive that he once snapped the blade of the Sword of Omens with his bare hands (it was later repaired by Bengali). Combative by nature, Tug Mug can use a \\"gravity carbine\\" in battle, whose gravitation beams can make a living being or object light as air or as heavy as stone. * Chilla (voiced by Gerrianne Raphael) ‚Äì This female Lunatak from the ice moon of Plun-Darr has command over cold and heat by the power of her expelled breath, blowing to freeze the air around a target in seconds to immobilize them, or heating it through her heat beams (both optical or from her hands) to incite flames or burn them. She has little regard for life and sometimes uses her powers willfully out of spite. Her one major weakness is rock salt which is known for its ability to melt ice. Out of all the Lunataks, Chilla is the most humanoid. * Red-Eye (voiced by Earle Hyman) ‚Äì A Lunatak from the misty moon of Plun- Darr, this hulking brute has enhanced vision capabilities allowing him to see things in infra-red and even to detect the ThunderCat Tygra when invisible. A loyal follower of Luna, Red-Eye uses a spinning discus (stored in his armored chest plate) to battle his foes. He is often the engineer and pilot of Sky Tomb. =The Berserkers= The Berserkers are the odd band of Viking-like pirates who first appeared pillaging the northern shores of the Unicorn Forest (as seen in the episode The Terror of Hammerhand). They have a habit of repeating certain words or phrases three times. The original Berserkers resembled Vikings and were apparently all killed when their ship was sunk. By the Season 2 mini-series \\"ThunderCats-Ho!\\", a revived Hammerhand had formed a second incarnation of the Berserkers with new members endowed with cybernetic bodies and powers like his own. Mumm-Ra enlisted them into capturing Lynx-O, Bengali, Pumyra, and the two Berbils that rescued them. The Berserkers are made up of: * Hammerhand (voiced by Earl Hammond in the original series, Trevor Devall in the 2020 series) ‚Äì The leader of the Berserkers who has a cybernetic arm that can punch and pound with great force. After he and his original Berserkers were killed, Hammerhand was later mystically resurrected by Mumm-Ra who summoned up his spirit to animate a clone of Panthro which he had created. When the plan failed, Hammerhand's spirit broke Mumm-Ra's control and the clone body shifted into Hammerhand's original form before departing. * Topspinner (voiced by Bob McFadden in the original series, Erica Lindbeck in the 2020 series) ‚Äì A warrior and member of Hammerhand's second incarnation of the Berserkers who can spin at high speeds to deflect missile objects or smash opponents. His spinning can also make him dizzy. * Ram Bam (voiced by Peter Newman in the original series, Dana Snyder in the 2020 series) ‚Äì A member of Hammerhand's second incarnation of the Berserkers. Rolling by the wheel embedded in his chest, this fighter can launch himself along the ground at high speeds to smash through objects like a battering ram. Ram Bam also has rollers on his feet to help him move fast. * Cruncher (voiced by Earle Hyman in the original series, Chris Jai Alex in the 2020 series) ‚Äì A hulking pirate and member of Hammerhand's second incarnation of the Berserkers whose sheer strength can crush buildings and boulders with ease. =Grune the Destroyer= Grune the Destroyer (voiced by Bob McFadden in the original series, Clancy Brown in the 2011 series) is a Thunderian based on the saber-toothed tiger. This former ThunderCat noble was once a good friend to Jaga the Wise on Thundera. However, his lust for power and greed turned him renegade against his fellow ThunderCats, forcing Jaga to fight him in a titanic battle that lasted for days. Grune was defeated by Jaga, then banished and sent into exile in space. He wields a mace and possesses immense superhuman strength. Eventually, his spacecraft landed on Third Earth and he began terrorizing its natives until, many years later, he was defeated (by unknown means) and sealed away inside a tomb (which was covered with a stone slab and a tree to prevent others from opening it). At some point, Grune lost one of his fangs. A mystic seal in place over the doorway to his tomb kept Grune from causing further havoc after his death, until several centuries later, when a pair of Bolkins accidentally released his spirit in the episode Ghost Warrior. Once freed, the ghost of Grune seeks out the ThunderCats and attacks them. He toys with the ThunderCats briefly before departing the Cats' Lair and attacking a city on Third Earth and demanding \\"Fire Rocks\\" (the Third earth name for Thundranium, which Grune had become immune to for unknown reasons, despite being Thunderian in origin) from them. Eventually locating the substance himself and forging a replica of his original battle club from the material, Grune would go on to attack the ThunderCats a second time in the hopes of drawing out his old arch- rival Jaga, whose spirit ultimately defeats him using both Lion-O's strength and the Eye of Thundera. However, Grune would return later when summoned by Mumm-Ra to stop Jaga's spirit from obtaining the Star of Thundera (which was needed to help free three more Thunderians‚ÄîPumyra, Ben-Gali, and Lynx-O‚Äîfrom the Mutant prisons at Fire-Rock Mountain). When the ThunderCats return to New Thundera, Grune is resurrected by Mumm-Ra. Grune initially succeeds in defeating Lion-O, breaking the Sword of Omens and chaining Lion-O and Cheetara up on the Churning Rocks. However, Snarf gathers the pieces of the sword and while attempting to take them to Ben-Gali for repair, he is captured by Char who repairs the sword and makes it even more powerful. Sensing the sword is repaired, Lion-O calls for it and uses it to free himself and Cheetara. Grune attempts to defeat Lion-O, but fails and is banished back to Third Earth when Lion-O activates the ThunderCat signal. In the 2011 series, Grune is one of Claudus' trusted warriors who was best friends with Panthro in the past while confiding in him his desire to rise up the ranks. During one of their missions, Grune ripped his sabertooth off to save Panthro from Spidera. When Grune and Panthro sparred to prove themselves to get a promotion from Claudus, Claudus instead promoted Lynx-O to general and assigned Grune and Panthro to find the Book of Omens. Grune felt betrayed and drove himself mad with his own paranoia. Eventually, his jealousy towards the king was used by Mumm-Ra to convince Grune to become his follower and serve a key role in Thundera's downfall. However, Grune also intended to betray Mumm-Ra in the long run prior to leading the attack on the Elephants' village to obtain the spirit stone there resulting in Grune getting sucked into the Astral Plane thanks to Panthro (who lost his arms in the process). =Other villains= * Amortus (voiced by Peter Newman) ‚Äì A villain who appeared in \\"The Touch of Amortus.\\" He was a pinkish figure who had one short arm and an octopus tentacle on the other side. He was a being who had been trapped by Mumm-Ra on New Thundera's location called The Land of No Return. He pleaded with Mumm-Ra to release him from his imprisonment, so Mumm-Ra tasked him with destroying the ThunderCat Lynx-O. Amortus afflicted Lynx-O with his dreaded Touch of Amortus, which caused him to suffer from delusions of persecution], and he was alienated from the rest of his comrades. Lynx-O then flew to The Land of No Return to confront the source of the hallucinations, only to be inflicted with a deadlier Touch of Amortus that turned him to stone (the same move that petrified some of his other victims). He was also revealed to have turned many Thunderians to stone during his imprisonment, and it was only with the Sword of Omens that Lion-O was able to overcome the being, curing all of his teammates and temporarily reviving the stone figures, who were able to defeat him. Amortus called for Mumm-Ra to help him when the stone figures have him overwhelmed. As punishment for his failure, Mumm-Ra permanently banished him to another location. * Baron Tass (voiced by Peter Newman) ‚Äì A Thunderian baron of indeterminate feline motive who arrives on New Thundera in \\"Well of Doubt.\\" He is shown to have a history with Torr. Baron Tass tried to cash in on old debts, but Lion-O forbade him. He discovered the Well of Doubt and gave its water to Lion-O, where its waters filled Lion-O with doubt. After Lion-O was effected by the waters and Jagara discovered that the water he was given from the Well of Doubt, Baron Tass attacks the ThunderCats with some stone statues. Once Lion-O overcomes the effects of the Well of Doubt and defeats the stone statues, Baron Tass promises to change his ways starting with Lion-O having Baron Tass sealing off the entrance to the Well of Doubt. ** Mr. Grubber (voiced by Bob McFadden) ‚Äì A Thunderian of indeterminate feline motive who is Baron Tass's bookkeeper and assisted him in his plot. * Boatman ‚Äì A hooded robed boatman who appeared in \\"Lion-O's Anointment Final Day: The Trial of Evil.\\" He tried to stop Lion-O from traveling down the River of Doom. * Burnout (voiced by Bob McFadden) ‚Äì Burnout was a robot criminal that was accidentally released by Lion-O in \\"Mandora the Evil Chaser.\\" Lion-O helped Mandora recapture him. * Captain Cracker (voiced by Earl Hammond) ‚Äì A robotic space pirate who commands a starship named the Jolly Roger. In \\"Mandora and the Pirates,\\" he raids the Great Penal Planet to release a criminal contingent to help him take over the space-ways. He, his pirates, and the villains were defeated by Lion-O and Mandora. In \\"Exile Isle,\\" he and the Lunataks team up to plan a destructive return to Third Earth. In \\"Cracker's Revenge,\\" Captain Cracker lands on Way Outback and free the Lunataks and put Bragg and Crownan in one of the train's cages. They plan to go to Third Earth to attack it, since most of the ThunderCats are no longer on Third Earth. They were defeated by the ThunderCats when they were knocked into the moat surrounding Cat's Lair. ** Polly (voiced by Bob McFadden) ‚Äì Captain Cracker's robotic parrot. * Captain Shiner (voiced by Bob McFadden in a German accent) ‚Äì A monocle- wearing, dog-like space-faring alien mercenary commanding a starship named The Vertus and its sizeable crew. He is summoned on more than one occasion to carry out Mumm-Ra's bidding (for a substantial fee) although he did help the ThunderCats escape from a black hole. In the second appearance, he was instructed by Mumm-Ra to take the three Thunderians Lynx-O, Pumyra, and Bengali to Fire-Rock Mountain to be locked away near where some Thundranium is located. After Lynx-O, Pumyra, and Bengali are imprisoned in Fire-Rock Mountain, Captain Shiner engaged the Thundercats which ended with his ship being rocketed off to another location in outer space. * Charr-Nin ‚Äì Charr-Nin is a genie who was released from the Great Golden Harp by Wilykit and Wilykat as seen in \\"The Evil Harp of Charr-Nin.\\" * Child of Gorgon ‚Äì The Child of Gorgon is an evil giant that was seen in \\"The Mask of Gorgon.\\" It was imprisoned in stone thousands of years ago with the formation becoming the Hills of Elfshima. Mumm-Ra woke the Child of Gorgon by using the Sword of Omens' sight beyond sight on the Mask of Gorgon. Once the Mask of Gorgon was destroyed, the Child of Gorgon was also destroyed. * Conquedor (voiced by Jon Polito) ‚Äì Exclusive to the 2011 series, Conquedor is a robotic villain who has been capturing Berbils and selling them to the highest bidder. After the ThunderCats had crashed his auction and freed the Berbils and the other creatures in his possession, Conquedor led the Giantors and the Trollogs to attack the Berbils. With help from the Berbils, the ThunderCats were able to defeat the Trollogs and Giantors while Lion-O defeats Conquedor. * Demolisher (voiced by Peter Newman) ‚Äì Only appearing in a single episode, Demolisher is one of the more powerful foes to challenge the ThunderCats. Similar to Safari Joe, his motives are not power but glory. A dog-like being (resembling a thylacine), the Demolisher travels from planet to planet seeking a worthy opponent to battle with his arsenal of high-tech weapons. The Demolisher originally lands on Third Earth to battle Mumm-Ra. After Mumm-Ra is defeated by the galactic warrior, he convinces him that Lion-O is a far worthier conquest. Thus persuaded, the Demolisher seeks out and engages Lion-O in battle but is eventually overcome. Defeated, the Demolisher flees Third Earth in shame. Lion-O laments that such a strong and courageous warrior must live without a cause to fight for, stating, \\"...I wish he had joined us in our fight to spread the code of Thundera.\\" ** Dirge ‚Äì A stumpy armadillo-like drummer who is a companion of Demolisher. He serves the role of a cheerleader/herald and is somewhat of a \\"Snarf\\" to the Demolisher's \\"Lion-O.\\" * Driller (voiced by Bob McFadden in the original series, Matthew Mercer in the 2011 series, Stephen Tobolowsky in the 2020 series) ‚Äì A metallic demon of the sand who has a drill in place of legs. He also has changeable drill bits on his head, which allows him to drill through the sand, rock, and dirt in the deep desert. His services are for hire; his chief price is diamonds, which he needs to keep his drill points sharp. He once captured Panthro for Mumm-Ra, and appeared again to drill a tunnel from Acid Lake to the Cat's Lair. Driller starred in \\"Spitting Image\\" (where he was hired by Mumm-Ra to capture Panthro), \\"Return Of the Driller,\\" \\"Jackalman's Rebellion\\" (where he and Molemaster teamed up with Jackalman), and \\"The Mechanical Plague\\" (where he was reactivated by Mumm-Ra). In the 2011 reboot, Driller is a robot built by Grune to mine for Thundrillium. Driller managed to buy Grune sometime to get away before being deactivated by Lion-O. * Duelist (voiced by Miguel Ferrer) ‚Äì Exclusive to the 2011 series, the Duelist is a professional swordsman who claims the swords of his defeated opponents. One of his swords in his possession is the Sword of Hittanzo which he claimed from its sword-maker Hittanzo. He challenges Lion-O to a sword match with the Sword of Omens as its wager. Though the Duelist wins the sword, Lion-O manages to get it back with help from the Drifter (who was really Hittanzo all along) while disarming the Duelist of his swords. When the Duelist tries to attack Lion-O, Hittanzo intervenes and drives the Duelist out of town. * Enflamer (voiced by Bob McFadden) ‚Äì Enflamer is a creature who has mastery over the fire as seen in \\"All That Glitters.\\" Lion-O had to seek out Enflamer in order to reforge the Sword of Omens. A mutant attack had drained Enflamer of his powers. After a bath in molten gold caused by the ThunderCats, the Enflamer emerged and reforged the sword. However, he turns against the ThunderCats and taunts Lion-O. The ThunderCats managed to defeat Enflamer. * Frog Man (voiced by Earl Hammond) ‚Äì Frog Man is a humanoid frog who was the survivor of another planet that crash-landed on Thundera centuries ago. He tried to destroy the planet with a flood so that he can claim it as his own when his own planet's water dried out but was imprisoned by the Thunderians after his fight with Jaga. On New Thundera, he is accidentally freed by WilyKit and WilyKat. Pretending to be their friend, Frog Man quickly turns on them and tries to sink the new Cat's Lair. In the end, Lion-O is able to defeat him and trap him in his original prison. * Ice King ‚Äì An ancient king from 1,000 years ago who appeared in the episode \\"Secret of the Ice King.\\" He emerged from a melted glacier where he caused havoc to the Snowmen. Ice King managed to freeze most of the ThunderCats except for Cheetara. She manages to use the Sword of Omens to thaw Lion-O and the other ThunderCats. The ThunderCats discover that the Ice King is looking for an ancient egg to see his wife one last time before he dies. The ThunderCats now understand his actions and assist him in finding the egg. * Mad Bubbler (voiced by Bob McFadden) ‚Äì A reptilian phantom that inhabits the Hook Mountain thundrilium mines. The Mad Bubbler bears an uncanny resemblance to the bubble dragons from Bubble Bobble. * Malcar (voiced by Bob McFadden) ‚Äì An ancient alchemist whom Mumm-Ra summoned from the dead in Tomb Town in a plot to transmute Thundrillium into Thundranium on New Thundera. When he was revived as an old man, Mumm-Ra needed to send Malcar to the Canyons of Youth twice in order to restore his youth so that he could more effectively attack the ThunderCats. However, this plan backfires the second time as Mumm-Ra accidentally leaves Malcar in the Canyons of Youth making him revert into an infant due to Jaga's interference. With no memory of his previous life, the baby Malcar is given by Lion-O to be adopted by a Thunderian couple who arrived on New Thundera. * Mirror Wraith (voiced by Peter Newman) - A demon who hides behind the mirrors. The Ancient Spirits of Evil summoned Mirror Wraith to help Mumm-Ra when a pod containing the Thunderian girl Leah crash-landed in the Jungles of Darkness. Mumm-Ra disguised Mirror Wraith as a doll and gave it to Leah so that he can get into Cats' Lair. Snarf and Leah used the fire extinguishers to cover up all the mirrors to defeat Mirror Wraith. After Mumm-Ra transported Mirror Wraith back to the Dark Pyramid, he has the Ancient Spirits of Evil deal with him. The Ancient Spirits of Evil teleported Mirror Wraith away. * Molemaster (voiced by Bob McFadden) ‚Äì A moleman who enslaved the other mole people to work in his tunnels as seen in \\"Time Capsule.\\" He was defeated by Tygra. He later returns in \\"Jackalman's Rebellion\\" where he teamed up with Jackalman and Driller. * Mongor (voiced by Bob McFadden) ‚Äì A demonic goat-like being believed to be the personification of fear on Third Earth. For three centuries, Mumm-Ra had unsuccessfully tried to locate his tomb and free him, but the ThunderKittens accidentally freed Mongor allowing him to attack and subdue the other ThunderCats. He feeds from his opponents' fears to grow larger and more powerful. His only weakness is for his foes not to look directly at him, which takes away his power (as Lion-O, WilyKit and WilyKat discover to defeat him). * Nemex (voiced by Earle Hyman) ‚Äì Nemex is a three-eyed, four-armed imp-like creature of the Netherworld who once captured Jaga in \\"The Astral Prison.\\" * Ninja (voiced by Earl Hammond) ‚Äì In \\"The Thunder-Cutter,\\" Mumm-Ra summoned a ninja to defeat Hachiman after Mumm-Ra's deception on Hachiman is revealed. * Plutar (voiced by Peter Newman) ‚Äì Plutar is a criminal from the dark planet Onyx who was accidentally released by Lion-O in \\"Mandora the Evil Chaser.\\" Plutar is known for his toxic touch.

She steals the Arrietta bird from the Ro-Bear Berbils (who were hoping to get a good harvest) so the queen would get it to sing for her only. She has guards that are blindfolded for she forbids them to look at her treasures. She traps Lion-O in crystal casing as punishment for being in her treasure room. Snarf entered the queen's treasure room by digging under. He manages to free the Arrietta bird so it could sing high notes to help get Lion-O out of the crystal casing. Panthro arrives in the Thundertank before the queen's guards could destroy Lion-O, Snarf, and the Arrietta bird. It can be assumed that Queen Tartara perished as her kingdom collapsed. * Quick Pick (voiced by Bob McFadden) ‚Äì Quick Pick is a robotic pickpocket and escapes artist who was accidentally released by Lion-O in \\"Mandora the Evil Chaser.\\" He was recaptured by Lion-O and Mandora after the other ThunderCats saved them from the Mudhogs. In \\"Mandora and the Pirates,\\" he is among the inmates in the Gray Penal Planet who is released by Captain Cracker. He helps Lion-O and Mandora defeat Captain Cracker. Mandora plans to speak to the Galactic Governor to have a pardon given to Quick Pick in order to make him her assistant. * Rhino ‚Äì A Rhinosauran (which is a rhinoceros-headed gorilla) criminal who was incarcerated on the Gray Penal Planet. In \\"Mandora and the Pirates,\\" Captain Cracker and his crew invaded the Grey Prison Planet and freed Rhino in order to help him capture Mandora. * Safari Joe (voiced by Larry Kenney in an Australian accent in the 1985 series, Trevor Devall in the 2020 series) ‚Äì An intergalactic big-game hunter who ventures to Third Earth to hunt the ThunderCats in his self-titled episode after he had successfully hunted the Big Cats, Sky Cats, and Aqua Cats. He uses a rifle that has a variable arsenal of weapons (like capture claws, fire rounds, missiles, etc.). Safari Joe was known for his trademark slogan \\"Safari Joe...does it again!\\" Safari Joe manages to capture all the ThunderCats through different traps associated with their weaknesses and imprison them in cages made of Thundranium. He captures Wilykit and Wilykat by shooting darts into their hoverboards, fires energy bolts on Cheetara to negate her speed, traps Tygra in water, and uses an illusion of an energy bat to trap Panthro. Safari Joe fails to capture Lion-O thanks to Snarf supplying a distraction. When Safari Joe finds himself out of ammunition, he is revealed to be nothing more than a coward and is defeated by Lion-O. Safari Joe was made to promise that he would never hunt again and Mule was reprogrammed to ensure he kept his word. In \\"Fond Memories,\\" Mumm-Ra creates a gallery trap for Lion-O with Safari Joe being one of the portraits alongside Slithe, Ratar-O, and Spidera. ** Mule (voiced by Bob McFadden) ‚Äì Safari Joe's robot assistant whose head is shaped like a train. He helps to assemble traps, using a computerized analyzer called the Holojector to provide information on his prey which includes the information on their strengths and weaknesses. After Safari Joe was defeated by Lion-O, Mule was reprogrammed to make sure Safari Joe keeps his word to never hunt again. * Scrape (voiced by Bob McFadden) ‚Äì Scrape is a salvage expert from the planet Blue Plunder. In \\"Dr. Dometone,\\" Scrape came to Thundera where his superiors wanted him to mine a certain rock. In order to do this, he would have to remove the Great Oceanic Plug. This led him into conflict with Dr. Dometone (who was the guardian of the Great Oceanic Plug) and the ThunderCats.

He was defeated by both Jaga and Lion-O's father, Claudus, and was then banished to the \\"Shadow Realm,\\" but he managed to escape years later, kidnapping Claudus just before Thundera was destroyed. Through a sequence of nightmares, Lion-O eventually learns of his father's imprisonment in the Shadow Realm and is able to rescue him. The Shadowmaster has arguably come closer to defeating the ThunderCats than anyone else. In his one-time assault on the ThunderCats, the Shadowmaster would have succeeded had Mumm-Ra not interfered for fear that the Shadowmaster would replace him as the chief servant to the Ancient Spirits of Evil. * Ta-She (voiced by Lynne Lipton) ‚Äì A beautiful princess from ancient times who was imprisoned in the time continuum on her boat operated by her humanoid crocodile servants. She wields the power of the Doomgaze which enables her to mesmerize males with her beauty. The Ancients Spirits of Evil ordered Mumm-Ra to have the Mutants free her. They needed to obtain items in order to free Ta- She which included the hair of a cheetah (which ended up being a sample of Cheetara's hair), the tears of a Berbil (which Mumm-Ra extracted from Robear Belle), the shoe of a unicorn, and a hero to take her place (Mumm-Ra planned to have Lion-O be the candidate for this). Freed by Mumm-Ra, Ta-She puts the male ThunderCats under her spell. She is ultimately defeated by Cheetara (who is a woman was completely immune to the effects of Ta-She's beauty) and is then returned to her eternal prison. * Technopede ‚Äì An enormous mechanical centipede-like creature, the Giant Technopede is a war machine from the past.

A gentleman thief by trade, Tookit possesses a precognitive ability called Kleptovoyance, enabling him to see the potential use in pickpocketed items and people alike order to improve his chances in stealing something of greater value. This ability, in turn, makes Tookit a firm believer in preordain circumstances as he managed to obtain the Forever Bag from a fellow thief and proceeds in forcing Gusto, Jenyo, and Albo into his services by placing them in positions where he is the only one to keep them safe from the Dogs' justice system. He used that same tactic on Wilykat and Wilykit during their stay in the city, testing their abilities after he stole their items and later set them up as public enemies to keep them from leaving. However, the twins convince their fellow blackmailed peers to expose Tookit as they made a plan to stall him long enough for the Dog Constable to overhear him willingly admit that he subtly forced them into a life of crime without any regrets. Taking what he believed to be the Forever Bag, Tookit realized too late that it was a forgery with the real bag now owned by the twins. Though seemingly accepting being subjected to The Pit, Tookit secretly harbored a hairpin he stole earlier on his person with the intent to escape as he winks towards the viewers. * Two Time (voiced by Bob McFadden) ‚Äì Two Time is a robot with heads on both ends of his body where both sides of his body switch positions at different points.

When Lion-O travels back to Thundera before it exploded, Lion-O received the blueprints for it from Claudus. Using the blueprints upon returning to the present, Lion-O is able to find the Warbot's Achilles Heel. In \\"Mechanical Plague,\\" Mumm-Ra reactivates the Warbot in order to attack the ThunderCats. * Wolfrat ‚Äì A giant wolf/rat-like infiltration robot created by Vultureman in its self-titled episode. Mumm-Ra modified the robot with miniaturization gas where it manages to shrink most of the ThunderCats during its attack on Cats' Lair. With help from a normal-sized Snarf, the miniature ThunderCats managed to destroy Wolfrat. In \\"Mechanical Plague,\\" Mumm-Ra reactivates Wolfrat in order to attack the ThunderCats. * Zaxx (voiced by Bob McFadden) ‚Äì A four-armed birdman sorcerer who unsuccessfully fought Mumm-Ra for control of Third Earth in the distant past. Zaxx was left without form as his essence was trapped within a magical medallion. Any creature later wearing the medallion acquires his fantastic power but is progressively transformed to permanently become Zaxx, who requires a host body for retribution against his ancient foe. His medallion was discovered by Vultureman who escaped from his incarceration. Thanks to the ThunderCats, the medallion was placed on Mumm-Ra as they both fall into the cauldron.

The tentacles of the creature were strong enough to rip apart entire ships and it was known to consume large quantities of water which it stored within its body. One such Ramlak was known to have consumed the entire watery oasis home of the Fishmen. This left Koinelius Tunar with nothing but rage and he assembled a crew of his fellow Fishmen who traveled the Sand Sea in order to slay the beast. As part of their plans, they used to leave food floating on the sands to attract the beast and incidentally captured the ThunderCats who were being led by Lion-O. Before the Fishmen could kill them, the Ramlak attacked their ship but were driven off by Lion-O and his comrades. Following Captain Tunar explaining his past, Lion-O decided to accompany him in slaying the beast. They ultimately managed to find the creature but Captain Tunar's single-minded pursuit of revenge led to the loss of the ship along with the near death of the entire crew. This forced Lion-O to save the crew whilst Koinelius Tunar attempted to slay the creature only to be dragged into the Sand Sea where he was presumed to had been killed. When the Ramlak emerged once more, she seemingly swallowed Lion-O only for Lion-O to use the Sword of Omens to slice her apart from the inside. With her death, the entire stolen water of the Fishmen home was released into the sands creating a paradise oasis for the surviving crew who decided to remain behind. * Sandy-Tailed Hooji ‚Äì A small furry animal that is native to New Thundera.

The other ThunderCats arrive to fight Spidara only to have Cheetara and Tygra become entangled in her webs. Snarf manages to throw the Sword of Omens to Lion-O, allowing himself and the other ThunderCats to defeat Spidera. In \\"Fond Memories,\\" Mumm-Ra creates a gallery trap for Lion-O with Spidera being one of the portraits alongside Slithe, Ratar-O, and Safari Joe. In the 2011 series, Spidera was depicted as a giant spider that Panthro and Grune encountered after busting out of a prison camp during the Lizard War. Panthro told Wilykit and Wilykat that Spidera had him trapped until Grune ripped out his sabretooth and stabbed Spidera in her weak spot. * Sycorax ‚Äì Exclusive to the 2011 series, Sycorax is a dinosaur- like monster with bone-plated armor and was already dead before the series started. Mumm-Ra resurrected the Sycorax to use as his vessel so that he can attack the ThunderCats in daylight. The Sycorax is shown to have an unforeseen weakness to the leaves of the Caracara Tree. During the second battle, the ThunderCats had a hard time-fighting Sycorax until Ponzi's caterpillar Lucy emerged from her cocoon as a butterfly and ended up crystallizing Sycorax with her wings. Mumm-Ra emerged from Sycorax's body in raven form and got away. * Thunderian Mount ‚Äì Exclusive to the 2011 series, the Thunderian Mounts are cat-like horses that serve as a mode of transportation for the Thunderians. * Tongueosaurus ‚Äì Large semi-aquatic animals that live in the River of Despair. * Tricorn Elk ‚Äì The Tricorn Elk is a noble animal with strange-looking antlers.

Viragor is a wise and powerful being who has been living in the Forest of Magi Ore for centuries protecting it from anyone who would harm it. He was once aided in protecting the Forest of Magi Ore by Zig and his Wood Forgers even when the Wood Forgers had created magic paper. When Zig desired more wood to make more magic papers, they turned against Viragor by cutting down some trees instead of harvesting the wood from the dead trees. When the ThunderCats arrived in the Forest of Magi Ore, Zig lied to the ThunderCats stating that Viragor is a threat to the Forest of Magi Ore. When Lion-O's sword attacks were unable to work on Viragor, he eventually learned the truth when he was snatched into the skies by him. When the truth was known to the other ThunderCats, they helped Viragor drive away from the Wood Forgers. After the battle, Viragor used the wood from the oldest tree in the Forest of Magi Ore to make Cheetara a new staff after her previous one broke during the battle. * Winged Water Snake ‚Äì Flying snakes that reside near the Geysers of Life. * Wraith ‚Äì Exclusive to the 2011 series, the Wraiths are insect-like creatures that fly in large swarms like locusts.

The Lactosylceramides, also known as LacCer, are a class of glycosphingolipids composed of a variable hydrophobic ceramide lipid and a hydrophilic sugar moiety. Lactosylceramides are found in microdomains on the plasma layers of numerous cells. Moreover, they are a type of ceramide including lactose, which is an example of a globoside. The chemical formula of Lactosylceramide is C42H79NO13, which has 806.088 g/mol of molar mass. Moreover, The IUPAC name of LacCer is N-(dodecanoyl)-1-beta- lactosyl-sphing-4-enine . Lactosylceramides were initially called 'cytolipin H'. It is found in small amounts just in most creature tissues, however, it has various huge organic capacities and it is of extraordinary significance as the biosynthetic forerunner of the greater part of the impartial oligoglycosylceramides, sulfatides and gangliosides. In creature tissues, biosynthesis of lactosylceramide includes expansion of the second monosaccharides unit (galactose) as its nucleotide subsidiary to monoglucosylceramide, catalyzed by a particular beta-1, 4-galactosyltransferase on the lumenal side of the Golgi mechanical assembly. In creature tissues, the antecedent glucosylceramide is moved by the sphingolipid transport protein FAPP2 to the distal Golgi, where it should initially cross from the cytosolic side of the membrane conceivably by means of the activity of a flippase. Biosynthesis of lactosylceramide then includes expansion of the second monosaccharides unit as its actuated nucleotide subordinate (UDP-galactose) to monoglucosylceramide on the lumenal side of the Golgi apparatus in a response catalyzed by Œ≤-1,4-galactosyltransferases of which two are known. The lactosylceramide created can be further glycosylated, or it very well may be moved to the plasma layer essentially by a non- vesicular system that is inadequately seen, however it can't be translocated back to the cytosolic flyer. It is likewise recovered by the catabolism of a considerable lot of the lipids for which it is the biosynthetic antecedent. Erasure of the lactosylceramide synthase by quality focusing on is embryonically deadly.  Associated disorder Gaucher's disease is a sphingolipidosis described by a particular inadequacy in acidic glucocerebrosidase, which results in abnormal gathering of glucosylceramide essentially inside the lysosome. Gaucher's disease has been associated with instances of leukemia, myeloma, glioblastoma, lung malignancy, and hepatocellular carcinoma, in spite of the fact that the explanations behind the relationship are at present being discussed. Some suggest that the impacts of Gaucher's disease might be connected to malignant growth, while others ensnare the treatments used to treat Gaucher's illness. This discussion is not completely astounding, as the theories connecting Gaucher's disease with cancer fail to address the roles of ceramide and glucosylceramide in malignant growth science. Gaucher disease is caused by mutations in GBA1, which encodes the lysosomal catalyst glucocerebrosidase (GCase). GBA1 transformations drive broad gathering of glucosylceramide (GC) in different natural and versatile resistant cells in the spleen, liver, lung and bone marrow, frequently prompting endless irritation. The systems that interface abundance GC to tissue aggravation stay obscure.

It was created by David Jacobs (Dallas, Knots Landing) for CBS, which wanted to experiment with late night programming as a counterpoint to ABC and NBC's more successful efforts at that time of night. Drawing upon his experience with the prime-time serials, Behind the Screen was a dramatization of the goings-on at a fictional TV soap opera called Generations. This was not the first attempt to explore the concept of a \\"soap within a soap\\" as radio soaps had used the idea as far as back as the 1940s (A Woman To Remember), and Ryan's Hope had used the idea for a story in the early 1980s. It premiered as an hour-long special, and regular episodes were 30 minutes. The show focused on the beautiful young star of Generations, Janie-Claire Willow (Janine Turner), who was a pawn in a power struggle between her wheelchair-using mother Zina (Joanne Linville), her powerful agent Evan (Mel Ferrer), and her show's leading man, Brian (Michael Sabatino). The show's early pacing was a bit meandering and had problems finding an audience. The show seemed to be finding its focus, helped by stronger writing by Ronnie Wencker-Konner, when it was canceled after only 3 months on the air. The last episode concerned a backstage party where starlet Joyce Daniels was poisoned. Suspicion quickly fell on Lynette Porter (Debbi Morgan). In a bit of levity, Michele Lee (a star on Jacobs' Knots Landing) appeared as herself, playing a guest at the party; when questioned by police, she was mistakenly identified by the cops as Mary Tyler Moore. The lasting effect of the show lies in the wonderful cast. Mel Ferrer and Joanne Linville added a touch of class to the proceedings, and other cast members made impact on other shows. Janine Turner gained notice when she appeared as a Laura lookalike on General Hospital and eventually found fame in movies and on the quirky series Northern Exposure. Michael Sabatino appeared on Knots Landing as the unhinged Chip Roberts and later appeared on several daytime soaps. After Behind the Screen, Debbi Morgan was cast as Angie Baxter on All My Children. Coincidentally, she later appeared on a different soap actually called Generations as Chantal.

SFCTA is a separate legal entity from the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, and other transportation agencies in the San Francisco area, with its own administrative structure, policies, staff, budget, and with separate borrowing capacity. The Authority Board consists of the eleven members of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. The Authority was originally created to administer the proceeds of San Francisco's first local sales tax for transportation, which began in 1990 and was passed by voters in 1989 as Proposition B. Since then, the agency has taken additional responsibilities mandated by state law. Beginning in 2004, SFCTA became the administrator of the Proposition K sales tax for transportation approved in November 2003, which substituted the original 1989 tax. The 2003 Proposition K is a half cent local transportation sales tax program. Since 1990, the Authority has also been the designated Congestion Management Agency (CMA) for San Francisco, and has also served as the San Francisco Program Manager for grants from the Transportation Fund for Clean Air (TFCA). In the role of CMA, the agency has been responsible for developing and administering the Congestion Management Program (CMP). As part of its responsibilities, the Authority leverages state and federal transportation funds and grants to complement the revenues collected from the tax for transportation. The Authority also monitors transportation system performance to ensure that San Francisco gets a good economic return from its transportation investments. SFCTA also prepares a long-term Countywide Transportation Plan to guide future investment decisions. As program manager for the TCFA, the Authority approves funding for transportation projects that directly benefit air quality by reducing motor vehicle emissions. Since 2013, the Executive Director of the SFCTA is Tilly Chang, who was previously the Deputy Director. Previous Executive Directors include Jos√© Luis Moscovich, Andrew Nash, Carmen Clark and Brigid Hynes-Cherin.

If every line parallel to these two lines intersects both regions in line segments of equal length, then the two regions have equal areas. * 3-dimensional case: Suppose two regions in three-space (solids) are included between two parallel planes. If every plane parallel to these two planes intersects both regions in cross-sections of equal area, then the two regions have equal volumes. Today Cavalieri's principle is seen as an early step towards integral calculus, and while it is used in some forms, such as its generalization in Fubini's theorem, results using Cavalieri's principle can often be shown more directly via integration. In the other direction, Cavalieri's principle grew out of the ancient Greek method of exhaustion, which used limits but did not use infinitesimals.  History  Bonaventura Cavalieri, the mathematician the principle is named after. Cavalieri's principle was originally called the method of indivisibles, the name it was known by in Renaissance Europe. Cavalieri developed a complete theory of indivisibles, elaborated in his Geometria indivisibilibus continuorum nova quadam ratione promota (Geometry, advanced in a new way by the indivisibles of the continua, 1635) and his Exercitationes geometricae sex (Six geometrical exercises, 1647).Katz, Victor J. (1998), A History of Mathematics: An Introduction (2nd ed.), Addison-Wesley, p. 477. While Cavalieri's work established the principle, in his publications he denied that the continuum was composed of indivisibles in an effort to avoid the associated paradoxes and religious controversies, and he did not use it to find previously unknown results. In the 3rd century BC, Archimedes, using a method resembling Cavalieri's principle, was able to find the volume of a sphere given the volumes of a cone and cylinder in his work The Method of Mechanical Theorems. In the 5th century AD, Zu Chongzhi and his son Zu Gengzhi established a similar method to find a sphere's volume. Extract of page 27 The transition from Cavalieri's indivisibles to Evangelista Torricelli's and John Wallis's infinitesimals was a major advance in the history of the calculus. The indivisibles were entities of codimension 1, so that a plane figure was thought as made out of an infinity of 1-dimensional lines. Meanwhile, infinitesimals were entities of the same dimension as the figure they make up; thus, a plane figure would be made out of \\"parallelograms\\" of infinitesimal width. Applying the formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression, Wallis computed the area of a triangle by partitioning it into infinitesimal parallelograms of width 1/‚àû.  Examples  Spheres = The disk-shaped cross-section of the sphere has the same area as the ring-shaped cross-section of that part of the cylinder that lies outside the cone. If one knows that the volume of a cone is \\\\frac{1}{3}\\\\left(\\\\text{base} \\\\times \\\\text{height}\\\\right), then one can use Cavalieri's principle to derive the fact that the volume of a sphere is \\\\frac{4}{3}\\\\pi r^3, where r is the radius. That is done as follows: Consider a sphere of radius r and a cylinder of radius r and height r. Within the cylinder is the cone whose apex is at the center of one base of the cylinder and whose base is the other base of the cylinder. By the Pythagorean theorem, the plane located y units above the \\"equator\\" intersects the sphere in a circle of radius \\\\sqrt{r^2-y^2} and area \\\\pi\\\\left(r^2 - y^2\\\\right). The area of the plane's intersection with the part of the cylinder that is outside of the cone is also \\\\pi\\\\left(r^2 - y^2\\\\right). As we can see, the area of every intersection of the circle with the horizontal plane located at any height y equals the area of the intersection of the plane with the part of the cylinder that is \\"outside\\" of the cone; thus, applying Cavalieri's principle, we could say that the volume of the half sphere equals the volume of the part of the cylinder that is \\"outside\\" the cone. The aforementioned volume of the cone is \\\\frac{1}{3} of the volume of the cylinder, thus the volume outside of the cone is \\\\frac{2}{3} the volume of the cylinder. Therefore the volume of the upper half of the sphere is \\\\frac{2}{3} of the volume of the cylinder. The volume of the cylinder is :\\\\text{base} \\\\times \\\\text{height} = \\\\pi r^2 \\\\cdot r = \\\\pi r^3 (\\"Base\\" is in units of area; \\"height\\" is in units of distance. Area √ó distance = volume.) Therefore the volume of the upper half-sphere is \\\\frac{2}{3} \\\\pi r^3 and that of the whole sphere is \\\\frac{4}{3} \\\\pi r^3. = Cones and pyramids = The fact that the volume of any pyramid, regardless of the shape of the base, whether circular as in the case of a cone, or square as in the case of the Egyptian pyramids, or any other shape, is (1/3) √ó base √ó height, can be established by Cavalieri's principle if one knows only that it is true in one case. One may initially establish it in a single case by partitioning the interior of a triangular prism into three pyramidal components of equal volumes. One may show the equality of those three volumes by means of Cavalieri's principle. In fact, Cavalieri's principle or similar infinitesimal argument is necessary to compute the volume of cones and even pyramids, which is essentially the content of Hilbert's third problem ‚Äì polyhedral pyramids and cones cannot be cut and rearranged into a standard shape, and instead must be compared by infinite (infinitesimal) means. The ancient Greeks used various precursor techniques such as Archimedes's mechanical arguments or method of exhaustion to compute these volumes. =The napkin ring problem= If a hole of height h is drilled straight through the center of a sphere, the volume of the remaining band does not depend on the size of the sphere. For a larger sphere, the band will be thinner but longer. In what is called the napkin ring problem, one shows by Cavalieri's principle that when a hole is drilled straight through the centre of a sphere where the remaining band has height h, the volume of the remaining material surprisingly does not depend on the size of the sphere. The cross-section of the remaining ring is a plane annulus, whose area is the difference between the areas of two circles. By the Pythagorean theorem, the area of one of the two circles is œÄ times r 2 ‚àí y 2, where r is the sphere's radius and y is the distance from the plane of the equator to the cutting plane, and that of the other is œÄ times r 2 ‚àí (h/2)2. When these are subtracted, the r 2 cancels; hence the lack of dependence of the bottom-line answer upon r. = Cycloids = The horizontal cross-section of the region bounded by two cycloidal arcs traced by a point on the same circle rolling in one case clockwise on the line below it, and in the other counterclockwise on the line above it, has the same length as the corresponding horizontal cross-section of the circle. N. Reed has shownN. Reed, \\"Elementary proof of the area under a cycloid\\", Mathematical Gazette, volume 70, number 454, December, 1986, pages 290-291 how to find the area bounded by a cycloid by using Cavalieri's principle. A circle of radius r can roll in a clockwise direction upon a line below it, or in a counterclockwise direction upon a line above it. A point on the circle thereby traces out two cycloids. When the circle has rolled any particular distance, the angle through which it would have turned clockwise and that through which it would have turned counterclockwise are the same. The two points tracing the cycloids are therefore at equal heights. The line through them is therefore horizontal (i.e. parallel to the two lines on which the circle rolls). Consequently each horizontal cross-section of the circle has the same length as the corresponding horizontal cross-section of the region bounded by the two arcs of cyloids. By Cavalieri's principle, the circle therefore has the same area as that region. Consider the rectangle bounding a single cycloid arch. From the definition of a cycloid, it has width and height , so its area is four times the area of the circle. Calculate the area within this rectangle that lies above the cycloid arch by bisecting the rectangle at the midpoint where the arch meets the rectangle, rotate one piece by 180¬∞ and overlay the other half of the rectangle with it. The new rectangle, of area twice that of the circle, consists of the \\"lens\\" region between two cycloids, whose area was calculated above to be the same as that of the circle, and the two regions that formed the region above the cycloid arch in the original rectangle. Thus, the area bounded by a rectangle above a single complete arch of the cycloid has area equal to the area of the circle, and so, the area bounded by the arch is three times the area of the circle.

The books were critically acclaimed, and Nasdijj received several literary awards and recognition from major institutions. His \\"memoirs,\\" which dealt in part with issues of two adopted children who suffered from severe problems, were also acclaimed by Child Rights and HIV/AIDS activists advocating for greater awareness of American children living at acute risk. In 2006, journalists revealed that Barrus had published the Nasdijj books under a fictional identity, and that the events depicted in all three were largely fiction. In the United States publishing world, Barrus' work is cited as an example of memoirs released under misleading pretenses. The deception was revealed in the same period as two other literary scandals. Controversy arose over the portrayal of fictional accounts as memoirs, as well as authors presenting false personas. Native Americans strongly criticized Barrus for appropriating the historic suffering of their people. They criticized the publishing world for so readily accepting impostors. In the 1980s and 1990s, Barrus had published numerous articles and several novels. He is credited by Jack Fritscher with coining the term \\"Leather Lit.\\" Early life and education Tim Barrus was born and grew up in Lansing, Michigan, where he attended public schools. His parents were European American: his father Maynard Barrus worked as a foreman at the power plant. His mother Jean Anne Steginga was of Scandinavian descent. He has a younger sister Suzanne. Marrying at a young age, Barrus took a variety of jobs and lived in different regions of the country in his early years. He attended community college in Largo, Florida and started writing in the early 1970s, although he did not publish anything for years. Marriage and family At the age of 19, Barrus married Jan Abbott, from a nearby town. Together they have a daughter named Kree, born in 1974. In 1975 they adopted Tommy, a boy who Barrus said had severe developmental problems. After two years, they turned him back to the state, finding they were unable to care for him adequately. Barrus and Jan later separated and divorced. He moved to San Francisco and later Key West. Barrus remarried in 1993, in San Francisco, to a special education teacher named Tina Giovanni. She has worked with autistic children for 20 years.Andrew Chaikivsky, \\"Nasdijj\\", Esquire, 30 April 2006, accessed 20 July 2012 Work life Barrus was a \\"provocative associate editor\\" of Drummer Magazine for five issues (#117-122). An editorial by the publishers on his departure explained that they were impressed with the work that he had done, and regretted that \\"Justice Department persecution of publishers of erotica\\" had caused him to terminate the relationship.Jack Fritscher, Gay San Francisco: Eyewitness Drummer, (Palm Drive: San Francisco, 2008), 127 Jack Fritscher (editor in chief) described Barrus as \\"one of the best editors\\" the magazine had in the 1980s. Barrus subsequently worked as an editor at Knights Press, creating the LeatherLit Writers Series.Jack Fritscher, Gay San Francisco: Eyewitness Drummer, (Palm Drive: San Francisco, 2008), 361 By his account in later interviews, Barrus moved into social work, serving \\"special- needs children in Florida, Apache kids in New Mexico, disabled adults in Michigan,\\" and autistic children in San Francisco. In 1996, he and his wife Tina moved from Ft. Lauderdale, Florida to a Bureau of Indian Affairs School at Mariano Lake, New Mexico. This period inspired his persona as Nasdijj. He has said this Navajo word means \\"to become again,\\" according to an 1890s text. Irvin Morris, a full-blood Navajo and professor of literature and Navajo studies at Dine College, in 2006 said there was no such word in the language. Literary career Barrus began publishing articles in the late 1970s, primarily for the gay leather magazine Drummer. After his move to Key West in 1984, he also wrote for The Weekly News, a local gay newspaper. From 1985 to 1992, he published five novels, all dealing with homosexuality in different genres. While some were favorably reviewed, he never broke into mainstream acceptance. His novel Genocide was recognized as an early contribution to AIDS literature, described by critic Toby Johnson as \\"dark and pessimistic\\".Toby Johnson, \\"AIDS and Spiritual Wisdom\\", in Confronting AIDS Through Literature: The Responsibilities of Representation, (Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 1993), 125. In connection with Anywhere, Anywhere, a novel about Americans in Vietnam during the war, Barrus said that he had been a Vietnam veteran. This account was disputed by people who knew him. He also published numerous articles, reviews and other short pieces. Reception as Nasdijj In 1999, Barrus submitted an unsolicited manuscript to Esquire magazine under the byline Nasdijj; he noted to them that the magazine had never published a work by a Native American author. \\"Nasdijj\\" wrote that his essay was about the death of his adopted son from fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), and that he also had it. His essay, \\"The Blood Runs Like a River Through My Dreams\\", was published in Esquire in 1999 and was a finalist in the National Magazine Awards that year. The following year Nasdijj published this and other non- fiction essays collected as a book under the same name. Receiving widespread notice and praise, the collection was selected as a \\"Notable Book of the Year\\" by The New York Times, and sold 27,000 copies. Nasdijj's work received critical acclaim, and his first book was a finalist for the PEN/Martha Albrand Award and winner of the Salon Book Award. In a 2002 PEN Forum, in which authors were asked to describe \\"literary lineage\\", Nasdijj responded, As Nasdijj, Barrus received widespread recognition as a writer on the Native American experience. His work was described as a compelling combination of poetry and prose. His second Navajo memoir, The Boy and the Dog Are Sleeping (2003), won the 2004 PEN American Center's PEN/Beyond Margins Award. In the specialist Native American journal, Studies in American Indian Literatures (SAIL), Marijo Moore wrote, Interested in The Boy for its portrayal of fatherhood, in 2004 James Dowaliby, a former vice president for Paramount International Television Group, acquired the film rights from Nasdijj. By the end of 2004, he had approval from FilmFour of the United Kingdom to develop a feature-length adaptation. During the process, he began to suspect the book was fraudulent when an adviser identified numerous errors, including the portrayal of Navajo clans and kinship system. Barrus published the following books under the name Nasdijj: *The Blood Runs Like a River Through My Dreams (2000), *The Boy and the Dog Are Sleeping (2003), and *Geronimo's Bones: A Memoir of My Brother and Me (2004) Published as non-fiction, each memoir recounted purported aspects of the author's life. The memoirs referred to his Navajo heritage, his self-destructive and abusive parents (a white father and Navajo mother), his unhappy childhood as a migrant worker, his dysfunctional relationships with other family members, and his growing up to become a nurturing father. As an adult, he adopted two children: one with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and a second who was HIV-positive. In the books, the children are unprotected; the author attacks white society for their plight. Hoax controversy In January 2006, the journalist Matthew Fleischer published \\"Navahoax\\", an article in the LA Weekly, documenting Nasdijj as an ethnic European American named Timothy Patrick \\"Tim\\" Barrus. Fleischer provided details about Barrus' parents, marriages and other writings. The article noted that Barrus was known as the author of fiction relating to gay sado-masochism. Feischer said that suspicions about Nasdijj had arisen with publication of his first book; Sherman Alexie, a respected author of the Spokane tribe, said that he had complained to Anton Mueller, Nasdijj's editor, that the author had plagiarized him and other Native Americans. Alexie also wrote to Houghton Mifflin, which published the first book but then dropped Nasdijj as an author. Dowaliby dropped his film project because of his belief that the work was false. Extensive media coverage followed the article's publication. A former literary agent for Nasdijj, while not confirming the LA Weekly article, called it \\"well researched and highly persuasive.\\" News & Observer, a North Carolina newspaper that had published some of Nasdijj's work, confirmed that it had on file a social security number that matched that of Tim Barrus. Esquire magazine revealed that it had paid for a 1999 Nasdijj article with a check made out to \\"Tim Nasdijj Barrus\\". In \\"Nasdijj Shops Tell-All\\", Fleischer noted these developments. He quoted an e-mail from Nasdijj to an editor at Penguin Books, in which the author offered a novel called Year of the Hyena: The Story of Nasdijj. The article presented excerpts from Nasdijj's blog with the headline, \\"Deserving Death for Evil Deeds, by Tim Barrus\\". It quoted, \\"What you want to believe you want to believe. If I am the devil incarnate then I am the devil incarnate.\\" Subsequently, the host TypePad deleted Nasdijj's blog. Sherman Alexie (Spokane-Coeur d'Alene), commented publicly on the controversy. In an article published in the February 6, 2006 issue of Time magazine, Alexie wrote, He had become suspicious of Nasdijj, finding that the author appeared to borrow from his and other Native American writings. Asked by Alexie to review the books by Nasdijj, Morris found numerous errors that led him to believe the author was an impostor. He did not pursue the matter; as he said, The author and critic David Treuer (Ojibwe) described Barrus' actions as \\"harmful cultural fraud.\\" The activist Suzan Shown Harjo (Muscogee Creek and Cheyenne) questioned why the publishing world was taken in by Native American impostors. She said, \\"There should be a law for the Navajo Nation to sue Barrus for the profits he made while committing the crime of stealing tribal identity.\\" (She has also been critical of Ward Churchill, who as a professor of ethnic studies claimed to be Native American and acts as a spokesman. Harjo and others have documented that he has no record of Native American ancestry.) Barrus' hoax gained attention for occurring at the same time as other literary scandals: the writer James Frey was found to have made up portions of works published as memoirs, and the purported author JT LeRoy was revealed as a deception created by three people: a woman who performed as the young man in public appearances, and a woman and man who wrote \\"his\\" published works. None was the teenage boy from a poor background who was represented in interviews and the works. One journalist noted that \\"the convergence of all three scandals at once had the feel of a Triple Crown of hoaxery, with the grand losers being accuracy, truth, and literature itself.\\" Fleischer said that, writing under his pseudonym, Barrus had described the cost of such appropriation: After \\"Nasdijj\\" After the scandal broke, J. Peder Zane, the News & Observer's book-review editor, who had published some of Nasdijj's work and promoted his writing, reflected, In May 2006, Esquire published the article \\"Nasdijj\\", for which the journalist Andrew Chaikivsky interviewed Barrus. Chaikivsky describes a man whose \\"shifting emotional temperature\\" veered between \\"meticulousness and careful good manners\\" and \\"a full roar.\\" Barrus was quoted as saying, \\"I understand that a trust was violated. I'm not defending it.\\" In the course of the interviews, Barrus spoke of knowing Robert Mapplethorpe, being encouraged to write by Tennessee Williams, and adopting a developmentally challenged child with his first wife during the mid-1970s. Chaikivsky said, \\"Over the three days I spend with Barrus, I don't believe much of what he tells me.\\" The adoption was documented, as was Barrus and his wife returning the child to the state, which he said was because of the boy's severe problems caused by FAS.Andrew Chaikvisky, \\"Nasdijj\\", Esquire, 30 April 2006, accessed 20 July 2012 In May 2007, Virginia Heffernan reported in the Screens blog of The New York Times that Barrus had \\"found a home on YouTube\\", where he was posting \\"Nuyorican beat-style stuff\\", which she described as \\"irritable, pretty, autodidactic, engrossing.\\" Bibliography As Tim Barrus = *Mineshaft.

Theosophical Society Family background Pryse was born in New London, Ohio (a suburb of Cincinnati), and died in Los Angeles, California. Pryse married Jessica \\"Jessie\\" Mayer (died on Aug. 27, 1928) on Dec. 1, 1902 at Galesville, Trempealeau County, Wisconsin. James had a brother named John Morgan Pryse (Sept. 9, 1863 - Sept. 5, 1952) who died in Los Angeles and who was also a publisher and writer on esoteric subjects. James began his career in law, but gave it up for journalism. In adult life he travelled extensively, helping create a utopian colony in Topolobampo, Mexico, and editing the Topolobampo periodical from his New Jersey home. Pryse brothers and the Theosophical Society James settled in Los Angeles, California, in 1886. He joined the Los Angeles branch of the Theosophical Society on July 28, 1887. His brother John was already a member at that time. John later dropped out of the Theosophical Society and founded the Gnostic Society in 1928. The original headquarters of the Gnostic Society was in John's home in Los Angeles (address: 919 South Bernal Avenue, Los Angeles, California). In July 1888 the Pryse brothers arrived in New York City. In 1889, members of the Theosophical Society from New York City and Chicago purchased a printing press and type, for the purpose of setting up a publishing company which would handle the publishing needs of the various branches of the Theosophical Society located in the United States. This theosophical publishing company, named the Aryan Press, was located at 144 Madison Avenue in Manhattan, New York City. James was recruited to set up and operate the Aryan Press, which was in full operation by December 1889. Due to the success of the Aryan Press, a larger printing press was purchased and shipped to London, England. In August 1890, James was contacted by Helena Blavatsky (1831-1891) (co-founder of the Theosophical Society) and summoned to London, for the purpose of setting up and operating this new publishing company, known as the H. P. B. Press (Printers to the Theosophical Society). This printing press was also referred to as the \\"Blavatsky Press.\\" James left New York City for London in September 1890, at which time his brother John took over operation of the Aryan Press. The H. P. B. Press (Blavatsky Press) was installed in London ( at 42 Henry Street, Regent's Park, London, N. W.) about November 1890. Blavatsky had asked James to publish her Esoteric Instructions in the United States, so the work would be accessible to members of the American branches of the Theosophical Society.Boris de Zirkoff (1889). H. P. Blavatsky Collected Writings, Vol. 12, p. 499. Quest Books. Blavatsky's Esoteric Instructions was duly published by the Aryan Press in 1890. In The Apocalypse Unsealed (1910) Pryse published the secret key to decoding the esoteric meaning of the Biblical Book of Revelation.

He designed many buildings on the campus of the University of Tokyo, and served as the 14th president of the university. Career Uchida was one of five 1907 graduates from the Department of Architecture of Tokyo Imperial University. For the next four years he worked as an architect in the real estate division of the Mitsubishi group. In 1910, he returned to Tokyo Imperial University for graduate studies under Toshikata Sano, the country's leading structural engineer and a pioneer in the study of earthquake resistant architecture. From 1911, Uchida lectured at the university on structural engineering. As Sano's successor, he did pioneering work in the study of steel frame and reinforced concrete construction. He also made important contributions in the fields of fire prevention, urban planning, and the restoration of cultural monuments. His interests were wide-ranging, and he influenced nearly every aspect of architectural engineering in Japan. Uchida also had a lasting influence on the University of Tokyo. In 1923, after much of the campus was destroyed in the great Kant≈ç earthquake, Uchida oversaw the reconstruction effort and devised the master plan that shaped the campus as it exists today. In 1943, he was appointed president of the university. As president he successfully resisted demands from both the Japanese military and the American occupation forces that he allow the university to be used as a military headquarters. (By coincidence, the Dai Ichi Seimei Building, which ultimately did become the occupation's headquarters, was built to one of his designs.) Architecture Uchida is best remembered for the buildings he designed on the campus of the University of Tokyo. With the assistance of younger colleagues and students in the Department of Architecture, he designed some 30 buildings in a distinctive style known as \\"Uchida Gothic\\". The massing, towers, and pointed arches of this style recall the Gothic revival architecture of universities in the United States and Europe. But its overall abstract quality also suggests an Expressionist influence, especially in works in which Uchida collaborated with his colleague Hideto Kishida. A well-known example is Yasuda Auditorium. Completed in 1925, it is a symbol of higher education and one of the most famous buildings in Japan. His work was also part of the architecture event in the art competition at the 1936 Summer Olympics.

He was born at Santa Croce sull'Arno (between Pisa and Florence) on 8 November 1697, into a wealthy family. From 1715 he studied Law at the University of Pisa and obtained his doctorate of law in 1719. From 1728 he was the librarian of the Biblioteca Pallavicini at Genoa and (after extensive travels) in 1732 became librarian to the wealthy Riccardi family in Florence. He eventually succeeded to a professorship of ecclesiastical history at the University of Florence, and was a court theologian and counsellor to the Grand Duke of Tuscany. He died in 1770 and was buried in the Basilica di Santa Croce.

It runs parallel to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park just to its south. Like other park border regions, the history and economy of the valley are intertwined with that of the Smokies. The primary community is Wears Valley. Wear Cove is a type of valley known as a \\"limestone window\\", created when erosion weathers through the older Precambrian sandstone and exposes the younger Paleozoic limestone beneath. The northern rim of the Smokies is dotted with limestone coves, the most well- known of which are Cades Cove and Tuckaleechee Cove. Limestone coves contain very fertile soil which lured early settlers. Wear Cove is hemmed in by Cove Mountain to the southeast, Roundtop to the southwest, Davis Mountain to the northwest, and Hatcher Mountain to the northeast. Numerous hollows cut into the ridges throughout the cove, including Happy Hollow, Smith Hollow, and Little Cove. U.S. Route 321 is the valley's main road, connecting Townsend in the west with Pigeon Forge in east, where it merges with U.S. Route 441. This section of 321 is known as \\"Wears Valley Road\\". Lyon Springs Road connects Wears Valley Road with Little River Road inside the national park, crossing the gap between Cove Mountain and Roundtop and emerging at the Metcalf Bottoms campground. HistoryEarly settlement= Aaron Crowson's grave at Crowson Cemetery in Wears Valley Wear Cove is named after Samuel Wear, a Revolutionary War veteran who erected a fort near the entrance to the valley in what is now Pigeon Forge. The original name of the valley was \\"Crowson Cove\\", after its first settler, Aaron Crowson (1774‚Äì1849). While no one is sure why its name changed, the valley was using its current name by 1900.Inez Burns, History of Blount County, Tennessee (Nashville: Benson Printing, 1957). Crowson arrived in Wear Cove from North Carolina in 1792 along with his friend, Peter Percefield. This was a period of elevated strife between the Cherokee and the fast-encroaching Euro-American settlers. Wear's Fort was attacked in 1793, with Wear leading a punitive march against the Cherokee village of Tallassee shortly thereafter. In May 1794, Percefield was killed in a Cherokee attack. Crowson rode to Wear's Fort to get help, but the Cherokee had fled by the time he returned. Several settlers marched onward to Great Tellico to the west, where they murdered four Cherokee while they slept. Percefield was buried on a hill in the eastern half of Wear Cove in what is now Crowson Cemetery. Later that year, Crowson received a land grant for this plot of land.Ida Headrick Myers, \\"Recollections of Wears Valley,\\" The Sevier County News-Record, 1953. (http://www.headrickchapel.org/wears_valley.shtml) Retrieved: 16 July 2007. Along with Crowson, other early settlers in the cove included a Revolutionary War veteran named William Headrick, who arrived in 1821, and John Ogle, a War of 1812 veteran and son of the first settlers in Gatlinburg. Another War of 1812 veteran, Peter Brickey (1769‚Äì1856), arrived in 1808. Brickey operated a large farm and distillery in the valley until his death in 1856. The log home he built shortly after his arrival still stands in Smith Hollow (between Wears Valley and Townsend) and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.The Center for Historic Preservation, \\"Tennessee Century Farms‚ÄîBlount County\\" (http://histpres.mtsu.edu/centfarms/blount_county/#Brickey_Farm) retrieved: 16 July 2007. The Peter Brickey House, constructed ca. 1808 Like many other farms in the cove, the Brickey farm was ravaged by the U.S. Civil War. Isaac Trotter, who operated the iron forge at Pigeon Forge reported a Cherokee raid in Wear Cove in 1864.D.M.G. Emert, Beulah Linn (editor), \\"The Isaac Trotter Papers,\\" Smoky Mountain Historical Society Newsletter 12, no. 2 (Summer of 1986): 31. Earlier in the war, a Union army passed through the valley en route to dislodge the troops of Will Thomas who were entrenched in Gatlinburg.Beulah Linn, Reunion At the River: Official History of Pigeon Forge, Tennessee 1783-1930 (Pigeon Forge Homecoming '86 Committee, 1986), 10-20. Sometime after the war, Alfred Line established a farm at the base of Roundtop Mountain, near the southern half of Wear Cove. Line Spring, a clear mountain spring which flows down from the slopes of Roundtop, gave its name to a small recreational area that developed in this part of the cove. In the 1880s and 1890s, mineral- rich mountain springs were thought to have health-restoring qualities, and provided an early form of tourism for the mountain regions. In 1910, D.B. Lawson, the son of a circuit rider who had purchased the Line farm, constructed the Line Spring Hotel. The hotel boosted the valley's economy by providing a market for local farmers. =Religion= Headrick Chapel, constructed in 1902 Around 1800, Crowson and several other settlers erected a crude log church known as the Bethlehem Church. The church was used by both Methodists and Baptists throughout the 1800s, with Baptist services being conducted by an elected pastor and Methodist services being conducted by circuit riders. On occasion, both congregations would meet in a mini-revival known as a \\"union meeting\\". In 1886, both Baptists and Methodists constructed separate structures, although union meetings were still fairly common. For most of the 19th century, funerals in the valley were held at Headrick Cemetery, near the valley's western entrance. A large oak tree provided shelter for funeral-goers, although cold weather and rain often made apparent the need for a building in which to conduct indoor services. In 1902, according to local lore, the oak tree was destroyed by lightning, and in response, the residents erected Headrick Chapel on the cemetery's grounds. The chapel was shared by four Baptist and Methodist congregations, with funeral services having priority. The chapel's bell would ring once for every year of the deceased's life, a tradition still observed by the inhabitants of Wears Valley. In 2001, Headrick Chapel was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.David Frye, \\"Headrick Chapel: Symbol of a Rural East Tennessee Community,\\" Smoky Mountain Historical Society Journal 18, no. 4 (Winter of 2004): 2. (http://www.headrickchapel.org/davids_article.shtml) Retrieved: 16 July 2007. =The national park= The Wear Cove entrance to the GSMNP on Lyon Spring Road In 1934, the Great Smoky Mountains National Park was established. The park's border paralleled Wear Cove to the south, following the crest of Roundtop and Cove Mountain. With improvements to US-321 in the 1950s, tourist outlets began to trickle into the cove. Cabin rentals and outdoor supply stores are among the more common tourism-oriented venues in the valley today. In 2005, a group of developers led by Ron Ogle and Jerry Miller sought to build 400 houses on the slopes of Cove Mountain. This raised concern among many valley residents over the impact such development might have on Cove Mountain's scenic value. In 2007, Friends of Wears Valley - a group opposed to the development - unsuccessfully petitioned the Sevier County Regional Planning Commission to block the housing expansion on Cove Mountain. The group has posted \\"Save Our Mountains\\" signs throughout the valley, although the developers insist their plans will not harm the mountain's natural qualities.Craig Mintz, \\"Wears Valley Friends To Meet,\\" The Mountain Press, 27 September 2005.Greg Johnson, \\"Doomsday Development On Cove Mountain,\\" The Knoxville News-Sentinel, 4 May 2007.

Cathy Park Hong at the Library of Congress in 2016. =Dance Dance Revolution= Dance Dance Revolution was Hong's second book, published in 2007 by W.W. Norton. It is a collection of poems, written in a style that encompasses \\"code-switching\\", or the mixture of several languages, such as English, Spanish, French and Korean, and spoken extremely informally with the inclusion of slang. The story takes place in an imaginary place called \\"The Desert\\", a luxurious place where people of different origins and languages mingle, causing a blend of languages that form into a dialect known in the book as \\"Desert Creole\\". The narrator of Dance Dance Revolution is the Historian, who travels to the Desert to find the woman who her father once loved. \\"The Guide\\", a character in the story who acts as the tour guide to the Historian, is that woman. Most of the poems in the book are told from The Guide's point of view, characterized by the Guide's mixture of languages and point of view, with narration of the Historian, which is characterized by the Historian's use of standard English. The Guide uses the poems to talk about her life in the Desert as well as her past during the Kwangju Revolution, when she lived in South Korea before she moved to the Desert.Hong, Cathy Park. Dance Dance Revolution When asked about the unusual language in the book, Hong commented, \\"As far as the language, I was reading a lot of linguistic theory at the time, particularly on this idea of Creole as a language that is in transition. French, for instance, was a Creole of Latin before it became the \\"official\\" language. English is always in transition, although the Standard version is more likely to be frozen in its glass cube. But spoken, English is a busy traffic of dialects, accents, and slang words going in and out of fashion. Slang is especially fascinating. I love outdated slang dictionaries‚Äîthese words are artifacts that tell you the mindset and squeamish taboos of a certain milieu during a certain time period. I wanted the English in the book to be a hyperbole of that everyday dynamism of spoken English.\\" Awards * 2002 Pushcart Prize for Translating Mo'Um * 2006 Barnard Women Poets Prize for Dance Dance Revolution * 2018 Windham‚ÄìCampbell Literature Prize in Poetry Other awards include a MacDowell Colony Fellowship, Guggenheim, Fulbright, National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship, and New York Foundation for the Arts Fellowships.

It was founded on April 21, 1997, and has developed video games for other video game companies, including Nintendo, SEGA, and Square Enix.  Overview  The name of the company is a portmanteau, which came from the early days of the company, where the company strives to produce independent video games (indies) with a low budget and minimal connections to other developers which is described as \\"almost zero\\" (zero). From an interview with Famitsu, another candidate for the company name came from one of the fictitious game companies appearing in \\"Game Center CX Arino's Challenge\\". The philosophy of the company is to make games that are easy to understand and user-friendly. At the start, the company specialized in creating games for handheld systems, but eventually expanded to making mobile games. The company is also involved in making licensed trading-card games for popular franchises such as Legend of Mana and Final Fantasy. In an interview with a local university, the founder Masanobu Suzui commented that the company plans to \\"make new products that has never been created before\\". He regards the company as a game developer that \\"cherishes a creative viewpoint rather than state-of-the-art technology capabilities\\" and makes games that can be immersed by a long-time video game player but also aimed at what everyone can easily play.  History  In 1997, Masunobu Suzui founded the company at 24 years old, along with two members from the fresh graduate discovery project \\"Nintendo & Dentsu Game Seminar\\" (predecessor of the current \\"Nintendo Game Seminar\\"). They were initially tasked with developing programs for Nintendo's Satellaview peripheral for the Super Famicom. Some of the projects they worked on included \\"Sutto Hankoku\\" and \\"Cooking Pong!\\". The company went to develop many titles for the Nintendo DS such as Electroplankton. Shaberu! DS Ory≈çri Navi released by Nintendo in July 2006 won the 10th Media Arts Festival Entertainment Division Excellence Award. Oshare Majo: Love and Berry was released from Sega in November which became a million seller and awarded a special prize in the annual work section of the Japan Game Award 2007. In June 2011, the company released DualPenSports as their first title for the Nintendo 3DS. The company then collaborated with Square Enix on Theatrhythm Final Fantasy, in which Masunobu Suzui reunited with former Bandai producer Ikuro Kuroku when working on the game. The game went on to have an iOS and Arcade port, as well as two independent sequels titled Theatrhythm Final Fantasy: Curtain Call and Theatrhythm Dragon Quest. The company then collaborated with Nintendo EAD for the development of NES Remix for both the Nintendo 3DS and the Wii U. During the planning phase, Koichi Hayashida, the Director of Nintendo Tokyo Production Department who participated in the \\"Nintendo & Dentsu Game Seminar\\" in his student days together with Masunobu Suzui, called up Suzui to partner up on the game development. Suzui then came to Hayashida with a game prototype, which Hayashida approved and green-lighted on the spot. This was around the time when development of the \\"Nintendo 3DS Guide Louvre Museum\\" was just completed, therefore the company was able to commit to the project. The game was well- reviewed and two sequels in the form on NES Remix 2 and Ultimate NES Remix was developed. The company first mobile title was Grand Marche no Meikyuu, released in September 2016. The game was developed in collaboration with Square Enix, after development of Theatrhythm Dragon Quest was wrapped up. However, Square Enix announced the game servers closure in November 2017. During Nintendo's E3 Presentation in 2017, the company was revealed to be co- developing Sushi Striker: The Way of Sushido, a strategic action-RPG-puzzle game for the Nintendo 3DS with Nintendo. A port of the game for the Nintendo Switch, to be released on the same day as the 3DS version, was revealed in a Nintendo Direct in March 2018, making this the first title the company developed for the Nintendo Switch.

Mason (1830 - July 29, 1859) was the first Secretary of State for Washington Territory and was acting Governor for two and a half years while the territorial Governor, Isaac Ingalls Stevens, conducted railroad surveys and concluded treaties with First Nations tribes and confederations. Mason was born in 1830 in Fort Washington, Maryland. After the death of his father in 1837, he moved with his mother to her home town of Providence, Rhode Island. Mason graduated with honors from Brown University in 1850 and was recommended for the bar shortly after. Following the establishment of Washington Territory in March 1853, Mason was appointed Secretary of the Territory and came west, arriving in September 1853. As Acting Governor he served the state in time of war, from October 1855 to January 1856, as hostilities between settlers and First Nations peoples erupted in Snohomish, King, Pierce, and Thurston counties. Historians assess his efforts during this time as \\"marked with energy, decision, and wisdom.\\" Mason called for volunteers, maintained peaceful relations with non-hostile bands, and treated all parties with fairness. From May 15, 1855, Mason assisted Stevens in the negotiations of the Medicine Creek and Point No Point Treaties and was credited as the secretary of the treaty commissions. Mason transported documents to the nation's capital and secured $300,000 for territorial aid. In all he served four stints as acting Governor: # March 26, 1854 - December 1854 # May 12, 1855 - January 19, 1856: Gov. Stevens was in eastern Washington to establish treaties. # August 1857 - September 1857: Gov. Stevens resigned to become the delegate in Congress for Washington Territory. Mason acted as governor until Gov. Fayette McMullen arrived. # August 1858 - July 1859: Gov. McMullen was removed from office. Mason acted as governor until Gov. Richard D. Gholson arrived. Mason died after a brief illness at Olympia, Washington Territory. Isaac Stevens gave his eulogy at the funeral. His burial location was established by the Washington state Archivist from the primary source material and his grave marked in 1997 following an extensive search.

It was introduced in early 1949 for $7.95 as the \\"Man-from-Mars Radio Hat.\\" Thanks to a successful publicity campaign, the radio hat was sold at stores from coast to coast in the United States. The radio hat was manufactured by American Merri-Lei Corporation of Brooklyn N.Y. The company was a leading supplier of party hats, noise makers and other novelty items. Its founder, Victor Hoeflich, had invented a machine to make paper Hawaiian leis while still in high-school (1914), and by 1949 the company shipped millions of leis to Hawaii each year.

Hoeflich continued to develop and even sell machinery that manufactured paper novelty items. Battery-operated portable radios had been available for many years, but Hoeflich hoped a radio with innovative packaging and a publicity campaign could be a runaway success. The transistor had just been invented, but was still an expensive laboratory curiosity; the first pocket transistor radio was still 5 years away. This radio would have to use the existing vacuum tube technology and the tubes would be a prominent design feature. The loop antenna and the tuning knob were also visible. The hat was available in eight colors: Lipstick Red, Tangerine, Flamingo, Canary Yellow, Chartreuse, Blush Pink, Rose Pink and Tan.

This Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA) wire service story was printed in many newspapers, including these: Ames Daily Tribune (Ames, Iowa on March 28) 1949; The Daily Mail (Hagerstown, Maryland on April 1); The Lima News (Lima, Ohio on April 11); Lowell Sun (Lowell, Massachusetts on April 7) The Brownsville Herald, (Brownsville, Texas on June 3). This Associated Press Wirephoto featured a boy, Ed Donegan of Brooklyn NY. The articles typically included a photo of a young lady wearing the hat and a six-paragraph story. The radio hat also received widespread coverage in magazines. This included do-it-yourself magazines such as Popular Mechanics, Popular Science, Mechanix Illustrated, and Radio-Electronics. There was also coverage in general-audience magazines such as Life, Time, Newsweek, and The New Yorker. The radio hat was sold in department stores and by mail order. A Van Nuys, California service station chain sold the hats as a promotion item to customers who purchased gasoline. The massive publicity did not lead to lasting sales. Advertisements for the radio hat stopped in early 1950. In a 1956 interview, Hoeflich said the company still got orders for the hat even though it was long out of production. Hugo Gernsback, the Editor of Radio-Electronics, was impressed with the radio hat and the June 1949 issue had a two-page article describing the circuitry and construction of the radio. The cover photograph shows a 15-year-old Hope Lange wearing a Lipstick Red hat. She went on to become an award-winning stage, film, and television actress. She was nominated for the 1957 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role as Selena Cross in the film Peyton Place. She was also in the 1974 film, Death Wish.  Circuit description  The circuit was on a flexible liner that fit inside the hat. Radios at this time usually were powered by the AC mains. They used vacuum tubes that had a 6 or 12 volt filament supply that heated the cathode; and a 100 to 300 volt anode (or B+) supply. The technological advances in World War II for mobile radios produced inexpensive low power vacuum tubes. The radio hat had an external battery pack that provided 1.5 volts for the filaments and the 22.5 volt B+ supply. These were much safer voltages for use in a hat, especially since the full plate voltage is dropped across the earphone. This technique was commonly used in many simple radios, some having ninety or more volts present across the head or earphones. The battery pack would power the radio for up to 20 hours. The radio received the AM broadcast band (540 kHz to 1600 kHz) and was tuned by a knob between the two tubes. (Table top or console radio receivers of the day used 5 or 6 tubes to provide better performance.)  Schematic  The 1S5 vacuum tube converted the radio signal to audio and the 3V4 amplified the audio for the headphone. The 1S5 tube functioned as a regenerative detector. Audio detected by the 1S5 was resistance-coupled to the 3V4, where it was amplified and supplied to the earphone. The detector was provided with a cathode feedback level well into the oscillation range by the 330 pF capacitor. The received carrier blocked the oscillations, allowing strong local stations to be received clearly. In addition, the loop antenna was part of the resonant tuning circuit, resulting in near-unity coupling between the antenna and the detector, which helped provide a high enough level of carrier for the blocking function. A regenerative detector operated in this mode is sometimes called a superregenerative detector, but in this circuit there was no separate quenching oscillator. The blocking signal was ideally at the same frequency as the oscillation, as opposed to the usually lower frequency employed in a true supperregenerative detector. The regenerative detector in the radio hat had adequate sensitivity to receive stations much more distant than the stipulated twenty-mile range, but distant stations would not have had a strong enough carrier to block the oscillations and so would be received with an objectionable heterodyne, audible as an astable squealing noise. Furthermore, the loop antenna was somewhat directional. This was a limitation for a portable radio; the signal level could vary when the listener turned their head. If the target station was accidentally nulled, the carrier signal could fall below blocking level, resulting in an annoying squealing heterodyne similar to that present on stations outside the normal range of the radio.

In April 1862, General Grant's troops landed at Milliken's Bend before the siege of Vicksburg and occupied the Sparta Plantation. During the course of the siege, Union forces confiscated the Hermione House, on the Kell Plantation, for use as a federal hospital. They also took over some other plantation homes in the area.

Horseshoes are not used, but domesticated horses may still require trimming, exercise and other measures to maintain a natural shape and degree of wear. Within the natural hoof care philosophy, the term barefoot horses refers to horses which are kept barefoot full-time, as opposed to horses who are fitted with horseshoes. The hooves of barefoot horses are trimmed with special consideration to a barefoot lifestyle https://horse-canada.com/magazine/hoof-care/why-go-barefoot/. The barefoot horse movement advocates a generalized use of barefoot horses, both in non-competitive and competitive riding, often coupled with a more natural approach to horse care. Horses are kept barefoot in many parts of the world, including South America, Mongolia and other industrialized and non- industrialized cultures. History Horses were ridden and used for work by man for thousands of years before horseshoes were invented. The Ancient Greeks did not shoe their horses, and Xenophon in his classic work on horsemanship wrote, \\"naturally sound hooves get spoiled in most stalls,\\" and advised measures to strengthen horses' feet: More recently, Jaime Jackson, who studied wild and domestic horse hooves, promoted the modern variant of natural hoof care in The Natural Horse: Lessons from the Wild (1992).Reviewed, \\"The Natural Hoof: A Sign of the Times,\\" The Horse (October 10, 2001). Benefits of barefooting While horses have been used without shoes throughout history, the benefits of keeping horses barefoot has recently enjoyed increased popularity. Not only does the horse benefit with a healthier hoof in some cases, it can be less expensive to keep a horse barefoot, and many owners have learned to trim their horses' hooves themselves. As the health and movement benefits of barefooting have become more apparent in horses that have completed transition, horses are being competed barefoot in various sports (including dressage, show jumping, flat racing, steeplechase racing, trail riding and endurance riding). Barefoot trim Hoof nippers are used to begin a trim of the hoof wall. There are several styles of barefoot trim in use today, including the Wild Horse or \\"Natural Trim\\" (developed by Jaime Jackson) the 4-Point Trim (Dr. Rick Reddin of NANRIC), the Strasser Trim (one of the most controversial as the horse's sole and bars are scooped out to widen the frog), the \\"Pete Ramey\\" trim where elements of the wild horse trim are the goal but the process includes removing hoof wall and forcing the horse to walk primarily on the sole. Some types, such as the 4-Point Trim can be used alone, or with shoes.Equine Podiatry  Dr. Stephen O'Grady, veterinarians, farriers, books, articles Barefoot trims are marketed to the public as something different from the \\"pasture\\" or \\"field\\" trim which farriers are trained to provide, taking into consideration hoof health and bony column angles, though each branded type of barefoot trim has its individual differences and there is no standardization or agreement between various barefoot advocacy groups. In contrast to farrier trims, barefoot trims are marketed as an approach to high performance hooves without the need for shoes, or simply as a natural approach to hoof care (depending upon the individual trimming method). However, they are something different, designed by nature itself to maintain a healthy, sound hoof without the use of shoes. The barefoot trim aims to emulate the way in which hooves are maintained naturally in wild horse herds, like feral horse herds such as the American Mustang or the Australian Brumby, as well as wild zebras and other wild equine populations. Wild horses have been observed by Gene Ovnicek as having a hoof that tends to make contact with the ground on four points, and the hoof wall does not contact the ground at all.Summary Notes: 1998 Heumphreus Memorial Lecture But the wild horse studies and measurements gathered by Jaime Jackson, a farrier at the time and working in unison with farrier Leslie Emery (author, Horseshoeing Theory & Practice) from 1982 to 1986 dispute Ovnicek's findings (The Natural Horse: Lessons from the Wild, 1992/1988 American Farriers Association annual conference). The trim guidelines he created for the AANHCP require the hoof wall to be on the ground as the most distal structure - with the sole, frogs and bars also acting as support structures when the horse is on uneven terrain. This is said to be another difference between the barefoot trim and the pasture trim, where the hoof wall was left long and in contact with the ground. Like wild horse populations, barefoot domestic horses can develop callouses on the soles of the hooves, allowing them to travel over all types of terrain without discomfort. Important to the success of the barefoot trim is consideration for the domestic horse's environment and use, and the effects these have on hoof balance, shape, and the comfort of the horse. Objectives depend upon which method is followed: 1) many other than the AANHCP suggest shortening the hoof wall and heel to the outer edge of the concave sole for best hoof conformation, and 2) applying a rounded bevel (\\"mustang roll\\") to the bottom edge of the wall to allow for a correct breakover (the moment when the foot unloads and tips forward as it begins to lift off the ground) and to prevent chipping and flaring of the wall. There is some research, but no scientific double blind studies, which indicates that removing horseshoes and using barefoot trimming techniques can reduce or in some cases eliminate founder (laminitis) in horses and navicular syndrome.Laminitis, Navicular Syndrome, Coffin Bone Penetration - Natural Hoof Care, Maple Plain, Minnesota It is generally agreed upon by most natural hoof care practitioners that the management of the animal (diet and boarding conditions) are the most important components for the success of the horse to be barefoot. If the diet is unnatural, there will be inflammation and the horse cannot be comfortable. Impact of horseshoes Removable iron horseshoes known as \\"hipposandals\\" may have been invented by the Roman legions. Nailed-on shoes were certainly used in Europe by the Middle Ages. Horses were shod with nailed-on horseshoes from the Middle Ages to the present, though well-trained farriers also performed barefoot trimming for horses that did not require the additional protection of shoes. It has become standard practice to shoe most horses in active competition or work. However, there is a growing movement to eliminate shoes on working horses. Advocates of barefooting point out many benefits to keeping horses barefoot and present studies showing that improper shoeing can cause or exacerbate certain hoof ailments in the horse. A hoof boot may help protect the horse's hooves during the transition period. Damage from improperly fitted and applied horseshoes can be seen in a gradual distortion of hoof shape, along with other ailments. Hoof soles are often sensitive when going barefoot after a long period of having been shod (because they are not thick enough through callusing). It can take weeks, months, a year, or more, depending on the horse's prior condition, before a horse is sound and usable on bare feet. During this transition period, the horse can be fitted with hoof boots which protect the soles of the feet until the horse has time to heal and build up callouses, though these boots, especially when not properly fitted and used, can cause hoof damage as well. Hoof health The two things which can directly affect the health of the hoof are diet and exercise. Observers of wild horse populations note that the equine hoof stays in notably better condition when horses are in a herd situation and are free to move around 24 hours a day, as wild horses do, permitting good circulation inside the hoof.The Natural Horse: Lessons From the Wild, Jaime Jackson, Northland Publishing, 1992 It is recommended that horses be allowed to walk at least five miles per day for optimum hoof health. The terrain should be varied, including gravel or hard surfaces and a water feature where the hooves can be wet occasionally. Diet is very important too, as changes in feed can directly affect hoof health, most notably seen in cases of laminitis. Even some lots of hay may be high enough in sugar to cause laminitis. A healthy diet for horses currently with or prone to laminitis is based on free access to hay that has been tested for carbohydrate content and found to be less than 10% WSC + starch, some mineral supplementation, and no grain. Feeds and forage with high levels of sugar (carbohydrates) correlate with higher risk of clinical or subclinical laminitis and with other hoof ailments.Safergrass.org Articles on grass carbohydrates and laminitisThe Horse: Laminitis: New Study on Sugar and Starch as a Cause Natural hoof supplements can be used as a boost to the immune systems of horses when concerned with laminitis or other hoof ailments. D-Biotin supplements, often including the sulfur-containing amino acid dl- Methionine, are commonly known natural supplements that are effective for managing hoof health. Modern research by individuals such as Jaime Jackson and Tia Nelson have studied feral horses to observe the way in which their natural foraging and roaming affects their hooves. They noticed that the hooves of these horses have a different configuration from domestic horses kept in soft pasture, having shorter toes and thicker, stronger hoof walls. Controversies Whether wearing shoes or going barefoot is better for the horse is the subject of some controversy. Opponents of the barefoot movement argue that domesticated horses are routinely put through abnormal levels of activity, stress, and strain, and their hooves undergo excessive wear and shock. Stable-kept horses are not exposed to the same environment as wild horses, which can affect their hoof quality. Additionally, humans sometimes favor certain traits over hoof quality (such as speed), and will breed horses with poor hoof quality if they are exceptional athletes. This can lead to overall decreased hoof quality within a breed and in riding horses in general. Advocates of traditional hoof care suggest that shoeing is needed to protect the hoof from unnatural destruction, and that the horseshoe and its various incarnations has been necessary to maintain the horse's usability under extreme and unnatural conditions.

Players bid to take a particular number of tricks, and are awarded bonus points for doing so. The commercial game differs significantly from the traditional version in the use of a proprietary deck with 6 colored suits and the addition of 6 types of special cards that change gameplay. Deck Rage uses a deck made up as follows. * 96 number cards, divided among 6 colored suits (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple) each with 16 values (0-15). * 2 Wild Rage cards * 2 Bonus Rage cards * 2 Mad Rage cards * 4 Change Rage cards * 4 Out Rage cards There are thus a total of 110 cards in the deck. Fundex states there are 16 Rage cards (though its itemized list adds up to only the 14 listed here) and so some editions of the game may have additional Rage cards. Setup The game can be played by 2 to 6 players. One player is the scorekeeper and uses either the special scoresheet printed in the instructions (it can be photocopied freely) or a piece of plain paper to keep score. The entire deck of cards is shuffled and cut. Deal In the first round, 10 cards are dealt to each player. In each subsequent round one fewer card is dealt, until by the tenth and final round, each player receives only one card. Cards are dealt clockwise. The pile is put down in the middle of the table, and its top card is turned over. The color of this card is the trump suit; a card of this color played to a trick will beat any other card played except a higher trump. If this top card is a Rage card, it is discarded and another card is turned over, until a color card is shown. Bidding After viewing and organizing their hands, starting to the dealer's left, players bid in turn on the number of tricks they think they can take in the hand. Bidding is non-auction; a player's first and only bid is binding. Bids are recorded by the scorekeeper. Four players can play in partnerships, while 6 players can play in pairs or teams of 3. In such cases, bids are summed to form a team bid. After bidding is finished, the player on the dealer's left selects and plays a single card from their hand. Each player in turn then does the same, with the caveat that they must \\"follow suit\\" by playing a card of the same color if they have one. If the lead card was a Rage card other than Wild Rage (such cards have no intrinsic color), the color of the second card played determines the lead color that others must follow. If a player does not have any card of that color, they may play any card from their hand, including a trump card (if trump was not led) or a Rage card. The player playing the highest trump card, or if trump was not played the highest card of the led suit, takes the trick and leads the subsequent trick. =Rage cards= The 14 Rage cards in the deck have black borders and, with the exception of the Wild Rage card, do not count as being of any suit and therefore cannot win a trick. Their effects are as follows: * Change Rage - When played, the current trump color is replaced by a new one, by selecting the trump color of the players choice. That color becomes trump effective immediately for this and future tricks until another Change Rage or an Out Rage card is played, or the round ends. * Out Rage - When played, the current trump color is discarded, but not replaced. The face-up card of the trump pile is turned face-down and discarded, and the current and any future tricks in the round are played without a trump suit. A Change Rage card played later in the current trick or in any subsequent trick cancels this effect by choosing a new trump color. * Bonus Rage - When played, the person who takes the current trick adds an extra 5 points to their score. * Mad Rage - When played, the person who takes this trick subtracts 5 points from their score. * Wild Rage - This card is unique in that it is the only Rage card that can win a trick. When played, the player announces a specific color. This color can be the trump color. The Wild Rage card then becomes equivalent to a 16 of that color, beating any other card of that color. If both Wild Rage cards are played in a single trick, the card played first outranks the second. Scoring After a round is complete (all players' hands have been exhausted of cards), players count the number of tricks they have taken, and score as follows: * +1 point for each trick * +10 for taking exactly the number of tricks bid ** only +5 are awarded if the player bid and took zero tricks. To this, the Bonus Rage and Mad Rage points are added or subtracted (+5 for Bonus Rage, -5 for Mad Rage). Bonuses and penalties stack, so if a player takes two Bonus Rage cards they earn 10 extra points; if a player takes a Bonus Rage and a Mad Rage card, the bonus and penalty net to zero. An alternative scoring system is as follows: * +1 point for each trick * +10 for taking exactly the number of tricks bid (including a zero bid) * -5 for missing your bid (either higher or lower) This alternate form of scoring makes the game more volatile and competitive. Players that accidentally win more bids than they predicted, want to continue to win tricks to minimize their losses. Bonus Rage and Mad Rage points are added and subtracted the same as above. Winning The player who has the highest score after the tenth round (in which a single card is dealt) is the winner. Variations The game lends itself to many variations. Among the variants listed in the instructions packaged with the game are: * A player may play a Rage card even if they could follow suit. * Bids are made in secret, written on a piece of paper kept by the player and only revealed after the round is over. * Except in the last round where only one trick is taken, a player who takes every trick in the round (whether they bid to do so or not) earns 2 points per trick instead of only 1. Additionally, unofficial variants can easily be added. The number of rounds and number of cards dealt in each round can be varied widely, such as starting with a single card and increasing to 10, dealing 10 rounds of 10 cards each (no reduction in hand size in subsequent rounds), etc. The Rage cards' effects can also be altered; players may be able to choose a specific trump color when playing a Change Rage card, for instance.

He was the second Governor of Gibraltar during the Habsburg occupation. He served in this military position during the period of 6 August 1704 to November 1704. Early years Coolamber Hall House Nugent was born at Coolamber, County Longford. His father was Thomas Nugent, who descended from James Nugent, the younger brother of Richard Nugent, 13th Baron Delvin (died 1559). Henry's older brother was James Nugent of Coolamber. Career In 1690‚Äì91, Nugent fought in the Irish campaign, in support of King James, during the Williamite War in Ireland. After the siege of Limerick in 1691, Nugent joined the Imperial regiment of Irish under Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt in 1692,Parnell 1905, p. 45 entering into service for the Habsburgs, as being a Roman Catholic, he was unable to be commissioned in the British Army. In 1697, he distinguished himself while defending Barcelona against the French during the Siege of Barcelona at the orders of Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt. Once the War of the Spanish Succession started, he was created Count of Val de Soto (Conde de Valdesoto) in Spain by Archduke Charles, pretender to the Spanish throne. On 4 August 1704, Gibraltar was captured by an Anglo-Dutch force after a short siege which ended when Governor Diego de Salinas surrendered Gibraltar to Prince George, who took it in the name of the Archduke, as Charles III, king of Castile and Aragon. Two days later, on 6 August 1704, Nugent was appointed Governor of Gibraltar,Parnell 1905, p. 80 with the rank of Major General. He was described as \\"an Irish Catholic, not well regarded by the English\\" (). Brigadier Fox, commander of the English Marines, and junior to Nugent, demanded to go home. Hesse gave a refusal to Fox, prompting antagonism between Nugent and Fox. During the Twelfth Siege of Gibraltar in November 1704, Nugent was mortally wounded on 9 NovemberParnell 1905, p. 83 and died soon thereafter.

The Albany Bulb (also simply known as The Bulb) is a former landfill largely owned by the City of Albany, in California. The Bulb is the west end of a landfill peninsula jutting west from the east shore of San Francisco Bay. The term \\"Bulb\\" is often used to refer to the entire peninsula, which includes the Albany Plateau, north of Buchanan Street at its base; the high narrow \\"Neck,\\" and the round \\"Bulb.\\" The Bulb is part of the City of Albany, and can be reached via Buchanan Street or the Bay Trail along the east side of San Francisco Bay.  History  Albany Bulb seen from the bay Like the Point Isabel peninsula to the north and the Berkeley Marina, Point Emery, and Emeryville Marina Peninsulas to the south, the Bulb peninsula is a relic of almost a century of systematic filling of the shallow Bay and its adjacent wetland. This filling was largely halted by efforts of Save The Bay from the 1960s to the 1980s. The usual fill method can be seen in the rectangular lagoon at the west end of the Bulb peninsula, a remnant left when legal action finally forced closure of the dump: Enclose part of the shallow Bay with rock and concrete rip-rap, fill the created lagoon with garbage and debris, and (usually) top off with a layer of clay. The development dream was to join the peninsulas, leaving a narrow shipping channel edged by commerce. The tidelands off Berkeley and Albany were sold by the state in the 1870s, as railroads extended tracks northward along the waterfront from the Oakland terminus of the Transcontinental Railroad. (These tracks soon became the main transcontinental line.) Early in the 20th century, the tidelands were acquired by the rival Santa Fe Railroad. Creation of the Bulb peninsula can be said to have begun in 1939, when the Santa Fe Railroad dynamited El Cerrito del Sur, the low hill on Fleming Point southwest of Albany Hill, to build Golden Gate Fields race track. The debris was pushed into the Bay to create parking lots. Almost immediately afterward, the City of Albany extended Buchanan Street west on Bay fill, creating a lagoon between Buchanan and the north edge of the race track. Aerial photos show the gradual filling of this lagoon at the same time that dumping extended the peninsula west into the Bay and, later, north onto the Plateau. The small salt marsh south of Buchanan, fed by Codornices and Village Creeks, grew in the last remnants of the lagoon, an echo of much larger wetlands that once flourished farther south, where the creek waters emptied into the Bay behind (east of) the dynamited hill. The Bulb proper‚Äîthe round hill at the tip of the peninsula‚Äîwas created in 1963, after the City of Albany and Santa Fe, which owned the land, signed a contract for the disposal of construction debris. Thus The Bulb is made of mostly of construction debris such as concrete and rebar, as is still very visible. Lawsuits against the landfill operator brought the dumping to a halt in 1983. The City of Albany entertained a variety of proposals for development of the peninsula, including high-rise hotels and a marina. In 2002, however, 17 years of effort by Citizens for Eastshore State Park (now Citizens for Eastshore Parks) resulted in the Plateau and lower Neck, along with shoreline to the north and south, becoming part of The Eastshore State Park. The City of Albany maintains ownership of The Bulb itself. The City of Albany continues to negotiate to have the State Parks Department (owners of the park) and/or East Bay Regional Park District (managers of the park and owners of some adjacent shoreline) take over the Bulb. Other entities are reluctant due to liability and potential costs of making the area, with its projecting concrete and rebar, \\"safe.\\" Meanwhile, the Bulb area and adjacent Albany Beach have become one of the most heavily used outdoor recreation sites in the Bay.  Natural conditions and ecology  A beached jellyfish and kelp on the sandy shore of the Bulb Bay currents were altered by creation of the Bulb and fill peninsulas to the north and south (Pt. Isabel was natural, but its hill was dynamited in the 1950s and marshes between it and the mainland were filled). One result has been westward extension of tidal mudflats at the mouths of Codornices, Village, and Marin Creeks, between the Bulb peninsula and Pt. Isabel. These are the Albany Mudflats, protected as important habitat for waterfowl and shorebirds. The wooden posts in the area often serve as perches for Peregrine Falcons and ospreys eating their catches. Another result was formation of Albany Beach‚Äîlow dunes and a sandy beach running south between the Bulb peninsula and Fleming Point. Sandy beaches are rare on San Francisco Bay, but strong tidal current to and from the Golden Gate tend to create them along the Berkeley and Albany shorelines. The beach has been heavily used by dog owners for decades. Strong winds make the water south of the Bulb peninsula, off the beach, popular with wind- and kite- surfers. Eel grass near the Bulb tip is important subtidal habitat. The sheltered lagoon at the west end is a calm- water refuge during storms, and shorebirds use its riprap edge at high tide. Like other abandoned dumps, the Bulb became quickly vegetated. The vegetation is largely non-native, including weeds such as acacias, broom, and fennel; exotics such as palm and large thickets of Himalayan blackberries. The Bulb provides habitat for a variety of wildlife, including songbirds, rats, mice, black-tailed hares, as well as snakes, hawks and barn owls that feed on them. The Plateau area, once popular for flying model airplanes, has been partly fenced off as habitat for burrowing owls, as mitigation for habitat taken by sports fields to the south. As of 2016, a birder sighted and photographed at least one burrowing owl when dogs that are not permitted within the enclosed area entered it and flushed the bird out of the vegetation. The owl has since been spotted there again, but concerns about disturbance by dogs remain for this species that is quickly disappearing as a result of loss of habitat from development. The south shore's riprap is largely un-vegetated, but lagoons and some gentler shoreline on the north, facing the Albany Mudflats have welcomed typical salt-marsh vegetation such as pickleweed, salt grass, and gum plant.  Notable features  Because the Bulb is geographically unorganized and because the Albany Police Department had for a long period of time been given orders to not enforce the law barring \\"camping\\", the Albany Bulb is often described as anarchic. Many groups, including urban artists, otherwise- homeless Albany residents, dog walkers and owners, teenagers, and environmentalists, used the Bulb area and felt they have a stake in it. = Art = A humanoid statue made chiefly of scrap metal and wood. One of many such works on The Bulb. The Bulb was home to a vast array of urban art including mural, stencil, graffiti, sculpture, and installation art. In 2016, some art remains but it is quickly deteriorating and no where as vibrant as it was in its peak around 2006. Sculptor and activist lawyer Osha Neumann has created some of the largest works. He often collaborates with his son-in-law Jason DeAntonis. Sniff, a group of artists composed of Scott Hewitt, Scott Meadows and David Ryan, painted large, highly imaginative \\"murals\\" on wood and erected more sculptures on the northwest corner of The Bulb. Another Bulb landmark known as \\"Mad Mark's Castle,\\" after its builder, a long-time Bulb resident, is a large concrete, rebar and plaster shelter which sits on the south west corner of the Bulb, directly opposite the Golden Gate Bridge. The Bulb has been used for informal concerts and even a production of Shakespeare's The Tempest presented by We Players, a Bay Area site-specific theatre company, in 2006. = Library = The Bulb was home to a small, makeshift library, assembled mostly from driftwood and old boat pieces. The Landfill Library, comprised, on average, 300 volumes in various conditions, donated by its patrons. The books were free to borrow and keep, although a take-something-leave-something approach is encouraged. As of August 2013, the library is closed due to vandals destroying it. On January 12, 2014 the library burned to the ground after a fire of unknown origin. With the resident squatters gone, it will most likely remain closed. = Homeless community = Starting in the early 1990s, the Albany Bulb was home to a community of otherwise homeless individuals who lived there on and off for nearly 20 years, despite a lack of official permission from the City of Albany. Their presence was generally tolerated so long as the number of residents remained low. The population living on the Bulb had grown to approximately 50 or 60 in early 1999, leading to a mass eviction by the city later that summer. Homeless people began to filter back over the next few years, including many of those who had been evicted in 1999, and by early 2013, the population had again grown to more than 40. In May 2013 the Albany City Council voted to evict the residents of the Bulb, offering them minimal assistance with relocation to other living arrangements. Ultimately the city ended up offering 30 Bulb residents $3,000 each if they would leave their longtime homes on the Bulb in order to settle a lawsuit brought by the East Bay Community Law Center on behalf of the residents. 28 of the 30 plaintiffs accepted the buy-out and voluntarily left by April 24, 2014. Two Bulb residents, Amber Whitson and her partner Phyl Lewis, refused the settlement and the court dismissed their claims without prejudice. On May 29, 2014 at 4:00 am, Albany Police went out onto the Albany Bulb armed with assault rifles and arrested Amber Whitson and Phyl Lewis as well as one supporter, Erik Eisenberg, on charges alleging violation of California Penal Code 647(e) \\"lodging\\". A documentary about the Albany Landfill Encampment, Bum's Paradise was released in 2003 documenting the 1999 eviction. More recently, in 2013, Andy Kreamer (a former Bulb resident and aspiring history teacher) released a film called Where Do YOU Go When It Rains? featuring Bulb residents talking candidly about their experiences living on the Albany Bulb. In 2016, the Albany city council approved plans to create a city park out of the space. Although the agreement holds no legal weight, it sets the foundation for the city to approve budget funds for the park. Further, the main trails were widened and leveled after the 2014 evictions to allow for greater motor vehicle access, police patrols were increased, and vegetation was cut back for several years to prevent further camping.  Development  Environmental protections as well as understanding of the dangers of building on unconsolidated fill make it extremely unlikely that the Bulb could be developed. In 2006, Magna Corporation, owners of Golden Gate Fields race track, proposed a large commercial shopping area on the racetrack property southeast of the Bulb. Extensive protest led by Citizens for Eastshore Parks, headed by former Albany mayor Robert Cheasty, led to these plans being dropped. The future of the racetrack holdings remains uncertain. Voices to Vision, a two-year study that examined what citizens of Albany desired for the waterfront, concluded in 2010. Fern Tiger Associates who conducted the study reported that 62 percent of residents who participated in the study wanted to expand open space by at least 75 acres. This expansion would mean 163 acres of parkland, trails, and wetlands at the waterfront. The area would include the bulb, the Golden Gate Fields race track and parking lot, and the Eastshore State Park plateau. However, the study also found that half of participants wanted enough development on the waterfront to maintain the current tax revenue generated from Golden Gate Fields, which is about $1.7 million. 85 percent of participants reported that building a hotel on the site would be a good idea, with many supporting additional retail and restaurant developments on the site.
