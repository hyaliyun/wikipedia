Early life  Kilrain found employment as a teenager in Somerville, Massachusetts. As a country boy from Long Island, he had to learn how to stand up to the workers in the rolling mills. By the age of 20, he had been recognized as the toughest fighter in the mill. Kilrain was also a champion rower having won the National Amateur Junior Sculling Championship in 1883. He was later stripped of that honor when it was discovered that he was a prizefighter and thus could not be considered an amateur. In 1883, Kilrain took up prizefighting as a profession and quickly established a reputation as a very tough fighter.  Professional career  = World Championship fight with Jem Smith = By 1887 Kilrain already has been recognized as the U.S. National Champion, that gave him an opportunity to fight for the Championship of the World and silver belt versus the British Champion Jem Smith, scheduled to take place in December 1887, in France, at a little island on the River Seine, called St. Pierre d'Autils. The bout was attended by about a hundred of the upper class spectators and journalists, mainly from England, being covered by the major international media of the day, such as Reuters, Gaulois, etc. They fought 1-minute rounds with 30 seconds break between the rounds. At the outset the men fought evenly. After the 3rd round Kilrain scored several knockdowns, and wrestling formed the principal mode of operations for the rest of the fight. Before the 106th round had started, after two hours and a half of fighting (roughly three times the full duration of modern-day 12-round championship fights,) when darkness set in, the bout was stopped due to technical reasons, as no artificial lighting of the scene has been arranged the outcome was called a draw due to darkness. Clearly dominant throughout the fight (even the English newspapers wrote that \\"the Englishman was no match for the American crack\\",) upon his return to the United States, Kilrain was pronounced by Richard K. Fox of the National Police Gazette as Heavyweight Champion of the World for his bout with Jem Smith. The awarding of the belt to Kilrain was part of a strategy by Fox to draw Sullivan into a fight. Any remote claim he had to the title of world champion was lost in 1889 after his loss to John L. Sullivan. = Bout with John L. Sullivan = The Kilrain- Sullivan pre-fight poster Kilrain is perhaps best known for challenging champion John L. Sullivan in 1889 in the last world heavyweight championship prizefight decided with bare knuckles under London Prize Ring rules in history. They fought 1-minute rounds with 50 seconds break between the rounds. In a hard-fought contest, Kilrain lost at the start of the 76th round (after 2 hours 16 minutes) when Mike Donovan, his second, threw in the sponge. Kilrain had not wanted to give up thinking that he could outlast Sullivan, but Donovan defended his actions insisting that Kilrain would have died had the fight gone on. In any case, the Kilrain-Sullivan fight can rightly be listed among the greatest fights of the pre-modern era. = Later career = Kilrain continued on for 10 more years after the Sullivan fight with gloves under Marquis of Queensberry rules with some success. His most significant win was a 44-round knockout of Boston's George Godfrey in 1891. He retired with a record of 18 wins (3 by KO), 6 losses and 12 draws along with 1 non-decision. He lived in his later years as a devoted family man with his wife and children as proprietor of a saloon in Baltimore, Maryland. After his saloon burned down, he moved back to Somerville and was given a job with the parks department. After government cutbacks during the Great Depression he became a night watchman at a Quincy, Massachusetts shipyard. In his later life, Kilrain became good friends with John L. Sullivan. When Sullivan died in 1918, Kilrain served as a pallbearer at the funeral. He was also godfather to the English boxer Charley Mitchell's son Charles Mitchell. Death and Honors Kilrain died on December 22, 1937, in a local hospital from complications of old age and diabetes, aged 78.http://www.rarenewspapers.com/view/657602 Kilrain was elected to the Bare Knuckle Boxing Hall of Fame in 2009 and to the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2012.

It is located between the Swedish cities of Uppsala and Stockholm, at almost equal distance. Since 2009, the domes and telescopes of the Kvistaberg Observatory are part of a museum. The observatory established a 1 meter Schmidt telescope in 1963, which is a large size for this type of telescope designed to give a wide field of view.  History  The observatory was the result of a donation in 1944 from Nils Tamm, an artist who had studied astronomy in his youth under Nils Christoffer Dun√©r and √ñsten Bergstrand in Uppsala and remained an avid amateur astronomer throughout his life. Through the work of professor √Öke Wallenquist and professor Gunnar Malmquist at the observatory in Uppsala, the new observatory was fitted out with a large Schmidt telescope (100/135/300cm) in 1963. Wallenquist became the first director of the observatory (1948‚Äì1970) and was succeeded by Tarmo Oja (1970‚Äì1999) and later Claes-Ingvar Lagerkvist (1999‚Äì2007). The asteroid 3331 Kvistaberg, was named for the astronomical observatory, where hundreds of minor planets had been discovered with the Schmidt telescope between 1975 and 2005. Around 2004, Uppsala University decided to discontinue active research at the observatory. The property was sold to the municipality of Upplands-Bro, where Kvistaberg is situated.

He was a king of the Qin for less than one year, and died three days after his coronation. This gave rise to many theories as to his short reign. The most accepted one is that he was very old when he ascended to the throne (his father ruled for over 50 years).Nicola Di Cosmo, The Northern Frontier in Pre-Imperial China//The Cambridge History of Ancient China, p. 961 However, there is a conspiracy theory: that L√º Buwei poisoned the king or at least hastened his death, to put the next king, King Zhuangxiang of Qin onto the throne.

The character was created by writer and artist Frank Borth, and debuted in Feature Comics #57, which bore a cover date of June, 1942. Borth continued to write and draw the Spider Widow feature until the end of its run in Feature Comics #72 (June, 1943). Spider Widow is the secret identity of Dianne Grayton, a bored and wealthy athlete who decides to fight crime and foreign saboteurs after discovering she has the ability to control deadly black widow spiders. She disguises herself in a stereotypical Hallowe'en witch costume, wearing a green-faced old crone mask, a floppy black hat, and a long black dress. In her new guise, she calls herself \\"the Spider Widow, Grandmother of Terror\\". In a genre dominated by beautiful young superheroines with shapely bodies, Spider Widow was one of the few to subvert that stereotype; she's \\"a lovely young woman who actually made herself look like a hideous old hag to fight crime.\\" Valerie Estelle Frankel compares her to the heroine of the 1940-1944 Fiction House comic Fantomah, Mystery Woman of the Jungle, writing, \\"They transformed from nice young ladies into crone faces of rage and power.\\" Spider Widow had a complicated relationship with two other Quality heroes, forming a tentative romantic relationship with a male superhero, the Raven, and a corresponding rivalry with Phantom Lady for his affections. Trina Robbins notes that Spider Widow \\"turned the tables\\" on the usual hero/sidekick relationship, being a female hero with a lovestruck male assistant. The Quality Companion says that \\"this feature seemed to end before its time, probably a victim of Borth's entry into military service.\\" When Borth returned from military service in 1946, he was hoping that he could return and write more \\"Spider Widow\\" stories, but was told that there were too many GIs returning, and Quality couldn't give everyone their jobs back. He moved on to create a daily adventure newspaper strip, Ken Stuart, for the Frank J. Markey Syndicate. Fictional character biography In Feature Comics #60 (Sept 1942), Nazi agents set a trap for Spider Widow by posting an advertisement in the newspaper that requests her assistance, and then knock her out when she shows up. She is rescued from a boat bound for Germany by the bird-costumed Raven on his first heroic outing, and the two reveal a hidden U-boat to the U.S. Navy. She becomes romantically involved with the Raven (who is later revealed to be Tony Grey); however, neither initially knows what the other looks like without their mask on because they shared their first kiss in the dark. Starting with #60, the stories are billed as \\"Spider-Widow and the Raven\\". The two later team up with Phantom Lady in a multi-part crossover that spanned between Feature Comics #69-71 and Police Comics #20-22. This was the only time that Quality Comics' superhero characters ever appeared in each other's strips. Though Spider Widow initially worries that Phantom Lady is a potential rival for the Raven's affections, they nevertheless became allies. The Spider Widow, the Raven and Phantom Lady appear in each other's stories for several months in 1943, but her final adventure in issue #72 (Oct 1943) was a solo act. The character also appeared in two issues of Police Comics in 1943. Powers and abilities Spider Widow has the ability to psychically control black widow spiders. The reason for her gaining this power is never explained. She is also a trained athlete. Legacy Spider Widow inspired a character called the Widow in the 2002 Elseworlds miniseries JLA: Destiny, by John Arcudi.

The largest number of Baiga is found in Baiga-chuk in Mandla district and Balaghat district of Madhya Pradesh. They have sub-castes: Bijhwar, Narotia, Bharotiya, Nahar, Rai Bhain and Kadh Bhaina. The Baiga are a Munda or Kolarian people(part of the Bhuiya tribe) located in the central highlands of India. The name Baiga means \\"sorcerer- medicine man\\".  Demographics  The Baiga are designated as a Scheduled tribe in much of Uttar Pradesh. The 2011 Census of India for that state showed those so classified as numbering 17,387. They are, however, designated as a Scheduled Tribe in Sonbhadra district.  Lifestyle of Baiga tribes  The Baiga tribes practice shifting cultivation, called 'bewar' or 'dahiya'. Live- in relationships are common among the Baiga. If marriage does take place, the man compensates the woman's family for the loss of a working member. This reverse dowry either involves footing the bill of the marriage celebration or offering the woman's family mahua liquor. If divorced, the new husband must compensate the old one for the dowry amount. If the divorced couple have children, the wife has the first right, followed by the husband. If neither wants to raise the child, the community will allot a guardian to the child until age 15. The Baigas in Chhattisgarh are classified as Particularly vulnerable tribal group(PVTG) by Government due to their declining population and low level of literacy.The Government of India has notified 75 PVTG which reside in 18 states and one UT which are classified on the basis of five criteria and in Chhattisgarh Baigas along with Abhujmaria, Kamar, Pahadi Korwa and Birhor are included in this group.The women of these tribes were not provided reproductive rights like right to use contraceptives but in 2018 on a Public Interest Litigation Chhattisgarh High Court allowed them to have access to contraceptives.The Baigas were found to be highly focused on family planning. Culture =Language= It is believed that the ancestors of the Baigas spoke an Austroasiatic language, however no trace of it is left now. Some Baigas (specifically those from the Mandla district) have mentioned \\"Baigani\\" as their mother tongue in the past: Baigani is now recognised as a variety of Chhattisgarhi influenced by Gondi.Linguistic survey of India, Volume 6 by George Abraham Grierson. Page 241. Most Baigas communicate with outsiders in Hindi, and some of them also know a few local languages such as Gondi and Marathi depending on the region where they live. = Tattooing = Baiga tattoos Tattooing is an integral part of their lifestyle. This tribe inhabits the dense hilly forests in the eastern part of the Satpuras, in Shahdol, Bilaspur, Rajnandgaon, Mandla and Balaghat districts. It is believed that this tribe is an offshoot of the Bhuiya tribe of Chhota Nagpur. A distinguishing feature of the Baiga tribe is that their women are famous for sporting tattoos of various kinds on almost all parts of their body. The women who work as tattooing artists belong to the Ojha, Badni and Dewar tribes of Madhya Pradesh are called Godharins. They are extremely knowledgeable about the different types of tattoos preferred by various tribes. Their mothers traditionally pass on this knowledge to them. Tattooing amongst the tribals commences with the approach of winter and continues until summer. =Cuisine= leftBaiga cuisine primarily consists of coarse grains, such as kodo millet and kutki, and involves very little flour. Another staple food of the baiga is pej, a drink that can be made from ground macca or from the water left from boiling rice. They supplement this diet with food from the forest, including many fruits and vegetables. They hunt, primarily fish and small mammals. Forced evictions Since the 1960s, the Baiga have been the victims of forced evictions at the hands of the Indian authorities.http://www.galli.in/2011/08/out-of-junglethe-baigas-sayantan- bera.html, 'the village Bhanpur Khera was relocated from inside the Khana National Park (a critical tiger habitat) way back in 1968.'

It was created on 19 March 1929 for the surgeon Sir Berkeley Moynihan, 1st Baronet, the son of the Victoria Cross recipient Andrew Moynihan. Sir Berkeley had already been created a Baronet, of Carr Manor, in 1922.Complete Peerage, vol. XIII, St Catherine Press, 1940, p. 455. The titles fell into a six-year period of dormancy while they were the subject of a dispute on the death of his grandson, the third Baron, in 1991. This involved a complex series of legal proceedings between the third Baron's two sons, born separately by his fourth and fifth wives; the third Baron had believed that the eldest boy, Andrew, was not his son, and favoured the younger, Daniel. They were joined in the dispute by Colin Moynihan, younger half-brother of the third Baron; in March 1994 Colin Moynihan applied for a writ of summons thereby challenging the legitimacy of both sons and claiming the title for himself.Emma Wilkins, \\"Moynihan appeals to the Queen in fight for peerage\\", The Times, 12 March 1994. In 1996 the Family Division of the High Court ruled that the third Baron's divorce from his fourth wife Editha Eduarda had been obtained by fraud, meaning that his fifth marriage to Jinna Sabiaga had been bigamous and his son by that marriage illegitimate.Andrew Pierce, \\"Lords clear way for Moynihan's return to politics\\", The Times, 27 February 1997, p. 3. After this action had been decided, the Committee of Privileges of the House of Lords ordered DNA testing of Andrew Moynihan, which found that the third Baron was not his father. The Committee therefore resolved the disputed succession in favour of the petition from Colin Moynihan, summing up their decision by saying: > ...that neither of the two sons purporting to be the sons of the third Baron > can, in fact, be an heir to the peerage. In the case of the elder, Andrew, > the committee was shown overwhelming genetic evidence that he cannot be the > son of the late Lord Moynihan; and so far as the younger, Daniel, is > concerned, the evidence clearly shows that he is the child of a bigamous > marriage and is therefore illegitimate.

The red nucleus is pale pink, which is believed to be due to the presence of iron in at least two different forms: hemoglobin and ferritin.wikipedia Red Nucleus Revision https://sites.google.com/site/childrenoftheamphioxus/table-of- contents/wikipedia-red-nucleus-revision The structure is located in the tegmentum of the midbrain next to the substantia nigra and comprises caudal magnocellular and rostral parvocellular components. The red nucleus and substantia nigra are subcortical centers of the extrapyramidal motor system. Function In a vertebrate without a significant corticospinal tract, gait is mainly controlled by the red nucleus. However, in primates, where the corticospinal tract is dominant, the rubrospinal tract may be regarded as vestigial in motor function. Therefore, the red nucleus is less important in primates than in many other mammals. Nevertheless, the crawling of babies is controlled by the red nucleus, as is arm swinging in typical walking. The red nucleus may play an additional role in controlling muscles of the shoulder and upper arm via projections of its magnocellular part. In humans, the red nucleus also has limited control over hands, as the rubrospinal tract is more involved in large muscle movement such as that for the arms (but not for the legs, as the tract terminates in the superior thoracic region of the spinal cord). Fine control of the fingers is not modified by the functioning of the red nucleus but relies on the corticospinal tract. The majority of red nucleus axons do not project to the spinal cord but, via its parvocellular part, relay information from the motor cortex to the cerebellum through the inferior olivary complex, an important relay center in the medulla. Input and output The red nucleus receives many inputs from the cerebellum (interposed nucleus and the lateral cerebellar nucleus) of the opposite side and an input from the motor cortex of the same side. The red nucleus has two sets of efferents: * In humans, the majority of the output goes to the bundle of fibers continues through the medial tegmental field toward the inferior olive of the same side, to form part of a pathway that ultimately influence the cerebellum. *The other output (the rubrospinal projection) goes to the rhombencephalic reticular formation and spinal cord of the opposite side, making up the rubrospinal tract, which runs ventral to the lateral corticospinal tract. As stated earlier, the rubrospinal tract is more important in non-primate species: in primates, because of the well-developed cerebral cortex, the corticospinal tract has taken over the role of the rubrospinal.

She continued to speak Italian with her grandmother, Amelia Pincherle Rosselli, a Venetian Jewish feminist, playwright, and translator from a family prominent in the Italian Risorgimento, the movement for independence. Rosselli returned to Italy in 1949, eventually settling in Rome. She spent her life studying composition, music, and ethnomusicology and taking part in the cultural life of postwar Italy as a poet and literary translator. Her extraordinary, highly experimental literary output includes verse and poetic prose in English and French as well as Italian. She committed suicide in 1996 by jumping from her fifth floor apartment near Rome's Piazza Navona. Rosselli has been translated into English by Lucia Re, Jennifer Scappettone, Gian Maria Annovi, Diana Thow, Deborah Woodard, Paul Vangelisti, and Cristina Viti.

Fictional biography Scudder debuted in 1976's The Sins of the Fathers as an alcoholic ex-cop who had recently quit the NYPD and left his family after accidentally causing the death of a young girl. Living in a rent-controlled hotel room in Hell's Kitchen, he earns his living as an unlicensed private investigator--or, as he puts it, \\"doing favors for friends.\\" The series' overarching theme is mortality: the early entries are filled with scenes of Scudder alone in churches, compulsively tithing his small income, lighting candles for whatever deceased figures happen to be on his mind--and always for the girl whose life he had inadvertently taken. The fifth entry, 1982's Eight Million Ways to Die not only featured a more intricate plot than the earlier novels, but is the first to notably move the character forward: the novel concludes with Scudder introducing himself at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. Block planned to end the series there, but a promise he'd made to supply an editor friend with an original short story resulted in \\"By the Dawn's Early Light,\\" a story set during Scudder's drinking days in the 1970s (Abe Beame is mentioned as New York mayor) but told from the perspective of a recovering addict. The story was well-received, winning a Shamus Award for best short story of 1985. Block would go on to expand on that success with 1986's When the Sacred Ginmill Closes, which not only resurrected the series, but proved a favorite of both the author and his fans. From then on, Scudder's circumstances rarely remain the same for long: 1990's A Ticket to the Boneyard reunites him with Elaine Mardell, a hooker from his days on the force, and concludes with him staging the suicide of a man who had threatened their lives--a decision he recalls in a number of subsequent volumes. 1991's A Dance at the Slaughterhouse introduces TJ, a young Times Square hustler who becomes Scudder's prot√©g√© and closest ally. 1992's A Walk Among the Tombstones sees him struggling with Elaine's role as a prostitute (as well as a pair of violent kidnappers), while 1994's A Long Line of Dead Men ends with the two marrying. While Scudder never takes another drink (coming closest in Boneyard), alcohol continues to play a large role in his life: he continues to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings (which constitute a central setting of the later novels), and his best friend, Mick Ballou, is a career criminal and saloonkeeper with whom he often spends long nights. He also has a standing Sunday night dinner with his sponsor, Jim Faber, who eventually becomes a surrogate father figure. Scudder has relaxed somewhat in recent entries, and is now far more apt to enjoy an evening at Lincoln Center with Elaine than he is to take on a job. 2005's All the Flowers Are Dying, the sixteenth title in the series, seemed to have been written as a possible final chapter. However, a new Scudder book, titled A Drop of the Hard Stuff,--a second \\"flashback\\" novel--was published in 2011 and again set in the 1970s but during Scudder's first year of sobriety. The novella A Time to Scatter Stones is scheduled for a 2018 publication, featuring an aging Scudder helping friends of his wife Elaine who want to escape sex work.A Time to Scatter Stones (2018), Subterranean Press List of Matthew Scudder novels * The Sins of the Fathers (1976) * In the Midst of Death (1976) (#3 in the series) * Time to Murder and Create (1977) (#2 in the series) * A Stab in the Dark (1981) * Eight Million Ways to Die (1982) * When the Sacred Ginmill Closes (1986) * Out on the Cutting Edge (1989) * A Ticket to the Boneyard (1990) * A Dance at the Slaughterhouse (1991) * A Walk Among the Tombstones (1992) * The Devil Knows You're Dead (1993) * A Long Line of Dead Men (1994) * Even the Wicked (1997) * Everybody Dies (1998) * Hope to Die (2001) * All the Flowers Are Dying (2005) * A Drop of the Hard Stuff (2011) * The Night and the Music (2011) (short story anthology) * A Time to Scatter Stones (2019) In other media * The character of Matthew Scudder was portrayed by Jeff Bridges in 8 Million Ways to Die, in which the setting was moved to Southern California and characterized Scudder as a sheriff's deputy.

It is Scotland's highest village, at an elevation of around ,https://www.bing.com/maps?q=wanlockhead&mkt;=en&FORM;=HDRSC4 and can be accessed via the B797, which connects it to the A76 near Sanquhar and the A74(M) motorway at Abington.Lead Mining Museum History The village was called Winlocke until 1566, derived from the Gaelic Cuingealach (the narrow pass). Wanlockhead owes its existence to the lead and other mineral deposits in the surrounding hills. These deposits were first exploited by the Romans, and from the 13th century they began to be worked again in the summer. The village was founded permanently in 1680 when the Duke of Buccleuch built a lead smelting plant and workers' cottages.Undiscovered Scotland Lead, zinc, copper and silver were mined nearby, as well as some of the world's purest gold at 22.8 carats, which was used to make the Scottish Crown. Early gold miners included Cornelius de Vos, George Bowes, and Bevis Bulmer. Wanlockhead became known as \\"God's treasure house\\" from the richness of its mineral resources. William Symington, Engineer. Despite a branch railway (see Leadhills & Wanlockhead Railway), also the highest in Scotland, which served the village from 1901 to 1939, lead mining declined in the 20th century and finished in the 1950s. From 1850 the Glasgow and South Western Railway had provided sidings at Mennock Lye Goods Depot for the use of the Wanlockhead and Leadhills mines. The village had a curling club which was formed in 1777 and there were also quoits, bowling clubs, a drama group and a silver band which had instruments purchased for them by the Duke of Buccleuch. William Symington was from Leadhills, but lived and worked in Wanlockhead. His fame lies in the fact that he designed the engine used to power the world's first steamboat. This boat was successfully tested on Dalswinton Loch near Ellisland on 14 October 1788. Dalswinton was the home of Robert Burns's landlord, Patrick Miller. =Robert Burns= Robert Burns and an associate, Thomas Sloan, visited Wanlockhead in the winter of 1789-90. The weather was very icy and they decided to have their horses' shoes 'frosted', that is sharpened to increase the grip. They had to wait their turn and took shelter at Ramage's Inn, where Burns wrote a poem entitled Pegasus at Wanlockhead. Pegasus was the name of Burns' horse. Burns also visited Wanlockhead in January 1792 to explore the lead mines. He was accompanied by Maria Riddell, the sister of Robert Riddell of Friar's Carse. They breakfasted at Sanquhar and then took a poste-chaise to the mines. They went a considerable distance into the mines, braving the dark, wet and cramped conditions at first; however they had to turn back as Burns found the poor air very distressing. Burns did not record this visit, but Maria included the details in a letter. Geography =Climate= Wanlockhead has a moist oceanic climate (Cfb, according to the K√∂ppen climate classification), with cool to chilly weather throughout the year, bordering on a subpolar oceanic climate (Cfc, according K√∂ppen). This town has cool summers and chilly winters, with snowfalls. It is one of the coldest inhabited places in the United Kingdom. Facilities The village now features a lead mining museum and industrial equipment from the 18th century and is a popular tourist destination. Wanlockhead is on the Southern Upland Way, a walking trail that traditionally starts at Portpatrick on the west coast, in Dumfries & Galloway, and finishes some 212 miles (341 km) away at Cockburnspath on the east coast, in the Scottish Borders. The village is also the home of the highest pub in Scotland, the Wanlockhead Inn which opened in 2003; an earlier pub situated on a track rising from the other side of the main road through the village was considerably higher, but closed in the late 1990s. The village is the setting for the BBC television drama series, Hope Springs. =Wanlockhead library= The old Wanlockhead Miners' Library, now the Museum of Lead Mining, Wanlockhead. Wanlockhead Miners' Library is the second oldest subscription library in Great Britain and was established on 1 November 1756 with 32 male members who mainly funded the purchase of the books, etc.; a contribution was also made by mining companies who were keen to encourage such acts of 'self-improvement' amongst the miners. The Duke of Buccleuch, as the land owner, was a major patron of the library. The library was essential in facilitating a level of educational achievement that allowed some miners and their children to escape the toil of mine work. The school housed the library at first, but as the number of books increased, it became necessary in 1787 to move the library to a cottage given for this express purpose by the mine overseers. However the cottage was a small one and it was found to be necessary to build a larger building. The number of books purchased through subscription eventually rose to over 2,000 and in 1851 a new library was built and survives to this day.Wanlockhead Library In 1974 the Wanlockhead Museum Trust took over the running of the library. The Miners' Library became a Recognised Collection of National Significance in October 2007. =Meadowfoot cemetery= This lies approximately from the village and dates from 1751. Before Wanlockhead had its own graveyard, coffins had to be transported along a typical corpse road the 8 miles (13 km) to the nearest graveyard, which was at Sanquhar. William Philip Minder who died on 2 April 1751 aged just 10 months was the first burial at the newly opened burial site.  Beam engine  Hydraulic pumping engine at Wanlockhead The beam engine and water bucket pumps were introduced into Wanlockhead in 1745. The history on the beam engine is not certain, but accounts of similar engines have been recorded on a coal mine at Canonbie, Dumfriesshire, in the 1790s. The Wanlockhead Beam Engine was built, supposedly, in the middle of the 19th century and is the only lasting example of a water bucket pumping engine to be seen on a mine in the UK today. The beam engine allowed miners to continue working in the Straitsteps mine, and assuming that there were two strokes of the beam per minute, this engine would have been able to lift around and requiring little attention it would have been left to do this twenty-four hours a day. The wooden bucket was fed from a cistern above and once the weight of water was greater than the water above the pump piston the beam was lifted, carrying water from up to below ground into a wood lined culvert which carried it off to the nearby burn. Periodically the weight of the piston was adjusted so that it remained heavier than the empty bucket, ensuring that the beam fell to start the cycle again. The Secretary of State for Scotland in 1972 took on the guardianship of the beam engine, making it Scotland's third Industrial Monument. Historic Scotland owns and maintains the engine. A working model of the engine is located in the Museum of Scottish Lead Mining.  Lowther Hills Ski Centre  Wanlockhead is one of the birthplaces of Scottish winter sports. Curling in Wanlockhead can be traced back to 1777, when the Wanlockhead Curling Society ‚Äìone of Scotland's first Curling societies- was created. Scotland's first boys' Curling club was established in Wanlockhead in 1883. The sport remained popular in the area until the 1930s, when the mines closed. Since the 1920s skiing in the Wanlockhead area has been organised intermittently by a succession of local residents as well as several non-for-profit sports clubs. Lowther Hill, above the village, is home to the only ski area in the south of Scotland, and Scotland's only community-owned ski centre. Operated by Lowther Hills Ski Club, the ski centre runs three ski lifts above the villages of Leadhills and Wanlockhead for beginners and intermediate skiers.Lowther Hills Ski Club See also *List of places in Dumfries and Galloway *Enterkinfoot and the Enterkin Pass *Mennock *Allenheads - an upland lead mining village in Northumberland that is above sea-level References =Notes= =Sources=  * * External links *The Lordship & Barony of Kilmarnock - photographs of Wanlockhead *Lowther Hills Ski Centre Category:Villages in Dumfries and Galloway Category:Mining communities in Scotland ","title":"Wanlockhead"},{"id":"2078208","text":"London Gateway services is the southernmost motorway service station on the M1 motorway, located between Junctions 2 and 4 north of London, England.

Following the success of their stripped-down fifth studio album Lie of the Land, the duo experienced attention from major publications, who praised the album, and the duo's fan base had built. Nonetheless, the duo were unable to commerce any performances in London. Their duo and their manager and producer Gerard O'Farrell took the gamble of hosting the city's historic Royal Albert Hall for a concert on 24 March 1996. The concert would be an attempt to gather all of the duo's fans and to raise the duo's profile. The duo were ridiculed for booking the hall, with many saying the performance would not sell out. Nonetheless, not only did the performance sell out, but it did so with advance orders, and it raised the duo's profile. Producer and manager Gerard O'Farrell recorded the event for a live album on the cost of ¬£200, and the duo released it on their own label Hands on Music in August 1996. It was released to positive reviews, with one review stating that it \\"stands alone as a showcase for the best of the band's repertoire over the last couple of years.\\" The album became the duo's best-selling album to date, a title it would hold for many years, and had sold 4,000-5,000 copies by mid-1997. The duo have since performed at the Royal Albert Hall on three other occasions. Background and concert Show of Hands became a collaboration for Devonian folk musicians Steve Knightley and Phil Beer in 1987, although the two had walked together several times before. The duo recorded the cassette- only albums Show of Hands (1987) and Tall Ships (1990) whilst Beer was still a member of The Albion Band, but Beer left The Albion Band in late 1990, allowing Show of Hands to become a full-time partnership. They recorded their last cassette-only album, Out for the Count, in 1991, and formed Anglo-Chilean band Alianza with Dave Townsend with three Chilean musicians, exploring world music. Alianza released a self-titled album in 1992, becoming Knightley and Beer's first CD release. Knightley and Beer soon continued performing as a duo and, with engineer Mike Trim, recorded a performance of Show of Hands from 8 June 1992 at Bridport's Bull Hotel, and released it on The Road Goes on Forever in 1992 as Show of Hands Live, the duo's first CD, but by the time of its release, the band's previous three albums were out of print,Roots: The Best of Show of Hands liner notes leading to it often being referred to as the band's album.Though the cassette albums have not returned to print, selected tracks from them were released as the compilation Backlog 1987‚Äì1991 in 1995. The band liked how the live album sounded and hired Mike Trim to produce their first CD studio album, Beat about the Bush, released on TWAH! Records in February 1994, an album that helped build on the band's success, although \\"despite Mike Trim's best efforts\\",Roots: The Best of Show of Hands the album did not receive the radio attention it intended, and the duo simplified their sound for their subsequent album, Lie of the Land, released in 1995 on Isis Records. Prior to the release of Lie of the Land, the band hired Gerard O'Farrell for live performances supporting Beat about the Bush, but he soon became the band's manager, and produced Lie of the Land. Whilst the duo had gradually built success, Lie of the Land was seen as a major turning point, having been given attention by major publications such as Mojo and Q, the latter naming it \\"folk album of the year\\". The duo received more attention and, by early 1996, they had by now built up a considerable fanbase through their mailing list. But despite the escalating fan base, they still could not command any London gigs. Knightley, Beer and manager O‚ÄôFarrell took the gamble of hiring London's famous Royal Albert Hall for a performance on the evening of 24 March 1996, in attempt to gather all of the duo's fans, and to raise the duo's profile. The duo hired the hall \\"to the amusement of the media and the cynicism of sceptics\\" and was considered a huge gamble. Nonetheless, the performance sold out in advance. Selling out the hall was \\"unprecedented for a folk act.\\" One biography said that the success \\"proved that for this enigmatic, indy duo anything was possible.\\" Knightley said in 1997 that \\"people still talk about it in glowing terms.\\" He also noted that \\"quite a lot of people now know Show Of Hands as 'Those guys who did the Albert Hall'. So it's opened a lot of doors. In India there was a tremendous cachet - we were checked out by people who came to see us just because of having played the Royal Albert Hall. In America as well. So it exceeded all our expectations in that sense.\\" O'Farrell commenced producing the performance as a live album, whose production work on Lie of the Land pleased the duo, who also liked the live sound of their previous live album Show of Hands Live, produced by Mike Trim. The album cost ¬£200 on the night to record. Music The Royal Albert Hall, where the album was recorded The show took place on 24 March 1996, and featured various guest musicians. The album is slightly condensed from the performance and slightly re-arranged. The performance opened, as does the album, with \\"Columbus (Didn't Find America)\\", the title track of the band's 1993 extended play, written by Knightley during the duo's time with Alianza. The song is a protest song about the Spanish exploitation of the New World.Show of Hands - Show of Hands  Release Info  AllMusic The duo then performed \\"Day Has Come\\", a song from Beat about the Bush, but the music had been re-arranged, although the lyrics stayed the same. This was followed by Lie of the Land song \\"The Preacher\\", non-album track \\"Cutthroats, Crooks and Conmen\\", and two traditional tracks, \\"The Blue Cockade\\", which had featured on Beat about the Bush, and \\"The Soldiers Joy\\", at which point hints the band will play the \\"one about the horses\\" later, referring to \\"The Galway Farmer\\". The band's long-standing live staple \\"Exile\\" plays next, which had recently been revisited following its re-recording on Lie of the Land, followed by \\"The Man in Green\\", Jacques Brel's \\"The Dove\\", \\"The Well\\", Lie of the Land opening track \\"The Hunter\\", which briefly, near its conclusion, incorporates an excerpt of \\"In the Jungle\\". This is followed by \\"Captains\\", the traditional track \\"The Blind Fiddler\\", and \\"Santiago\\", another track that dates from the Alianza days,It appeares on the Alianza album and features on their only album. The main set closed with \\"The Galway Farmer\\", which features a fast fiddle solo from Beer. The song is about is about an Irishman betting on a horse at a race at Cheltenham Racecourse and winning, despite being ridiculed beforehand. After a minute following the performance of the song after the band had left the stage, they returned to the stage to perform an encore of the Cyndi Lauper song \\"Time After Time\\", featuring a squeezebox. Sally Barker sings backing vocals on \\"Columbus (Didn't Find America)\\" and \\"Captains\\".Liner notes Vladimir Vega performs pan pipes on \\"Columbus (Didn't Find America)\\", including prominently in the intro of the song, as well as on \\"The Hunter\\" and \\"Santiago\\", also performing backing vocals on the latter with Matt Clifford, who also performed backing vocals on \\"Columbus (Didn't Find America)\\" which he also played keyboards on, as well as on \\"Exile\\". \\"The Well\\" and \\"The Galway Farmer\\" feature pipes from Nick Scott, accordion from Sarah Allen and whistle from Biddy Blythe, who also plays flute on \\"The Galway Farmer\\". The duo themselves play a wide range of instruments. Steve Knightley sings lead vocals on all songs, aside from the instrumental \\"The Soldiers Joy\\", guitar on eleven of the tracks, cello-mandolin on four of the tracks, cuatro on \\"The Preacher\\" and concertina on \\"Time After Time\\". Phil Beer sings backing vocals on nine of the tracks, plays the fiddle on five of the tracks, guitar on three tracks, the cello-mandolin on four tracks, cuatro on three tracks and mandolin on \\"The Hunter\\". Release and reception The performance was success, and the album entered post-production in spring and summer 1996.Liner notes. It was released in August 1996 as the first release of the band's own label, Hands on Music, with the catalogue number HMCD01. The album is slightly condensed from the original performance and some songs are presented in a different order. Living Tradition said the album \\"stands alone as a showcase for the best of the band's repertoire over the last couple of years.\\" Reviewer Graham Gurrin noted \\"how well it shows the duo's exceptional abilities as performers. Thinking of Phil Beer as a multi-instrumentalist has become a clich√©, but just listen to him play fiddle on \\"The Blind Fiddler\\" as if his life depended on it, his elegant cuatro on \\"Santiago\\" or the subtlety of his slide guitar work on \\"The Blue Cockade\\". The boy is a genius, and Steve Knightley must have been bathing his tonsils in honey for weeks before the gig. His harmonies with Sally Barker on \\"Captains\\" should be filed under S for spine-tingling. There is a hint of over-excitement in his voice throughout, which along with the contributions of the various guests gives a bit of an edge to the performances, particularly on stompers like \\"The Galway Farmer\\" and \\"The Hunter\\",\\" before praising how the album only has three tracks with the band's other live album, both albums having sixteen tracks. Steve Knightley said in a 1997 interview that despite the cost of ¬£200 to record on the night, the album \\"has been a great calling card to send festival promoters. So it exceeded all our expectations in that sense.\\" It became the duo's best selling album, and was reported by Knightley in 1997 as to having sold 4,000-5,000 copies at that time. The album is sometimes known as 24 March 1996, or 24 March 1996: Show of Hands Live at the Royal Albert Hall, due to the words displayed on the album cover. The album has been referred to as the band's best selling album to date, although this may no longer be true, and their later album Witness (2006) was reported as the duo's best-selling album. The duo subsequent album, 1997's Dark Fields, continuing Lie of the Land's stripped down approach, featured a single in \\"Crazy Boy\\", an attempt to further the profile of the duo achieved by the Royal Albert performance. The duo played further performances at the Royal Albert Hall in 2001, 2007 and 2012. The 2001 performance was released as a VHS concert film entitled The Big Gig. It was produced by Carlton who broadcast the film in two parts on television.

Overview The name Baidicheng literally means White Emperor City. It has been said that the area was once surrounded with a white mist, giving it a look which was rather mysterious, yet serene‚Äîmuch as what an emperor should be like. It has also been said that someone saw a white dragon, the symbol of the Emperor appear there, that the warlord Gongsun Shu thought this was a fortuitous sign, and so declared himself Emperor of Chengjia. Thus Gongsun was said to have founded the city, and so called himself \\"the White Emperor\\". The temple complex is now on an island, due to raised water levels following the construction of the Three Gorges Dam. Many older structures were submerged, and new buildings have been built higher up. The temple complex island is linked to the north bank of the Yangtze, by a bridge. The island continues to be a tourist attraction, with many cruise ships halting for tours at Fengjie. Baidi is also known as the \\"City of Poems\\", because so many poets such as Li Bai wrote about it (see: \\"Departing from Baidi in the Morning\\"). Another famous and talented poet, Du Fu, resided in Baidi for 2 or 3 years. Liu Bei, the first emperor of the Shu Han during the Three Kingdoms era, is said to have died in Baidi, although, according to Records of the Three Kingdoms, Liu Bei died at his palace of Yong'angong. The site of Yong'angong was located in what is now inside of the Normal School of Fengjie County, a few miles away from the current Baidicheng. Thus, as in other cases, the location of an ancient place is not necessarily the same as the location of a modern town with the same name. In 2006, the Chinese government established Baidi Fortress as a national heritage site. Gallery File:Baidicheng 2014.jpgTemple of the White Emperor.

This space is commonly used in descriptive set theory, to the extent that its elements are often called \\"reals\\". It is denoted NN, œâœâ, by the symbol \\\\mathcal{N} or also œâœâ, not to be confused with the countable ordinal obtained by ordinal exponentiation. The Baire space is defined to be the Cartesian product of countably infinitely many copies of the set of natural numbers, and is given the product topology (where each copy of the set of natural numbers is given the discrete topology). The Baire space is often represented using the tree of finite sequences of natural numbers. The Baire space can be contrasted with Cantor space, the set of infinite sequences of binary digits.  Topology and trees  The product topology used to define the Baire space can be described more concretely in terms of trees. The basic open sets of the product topology are cylinder sets, here characterized as: :If any finite set of natural number coordinates I={i} is selected, and for each i a particular natural number value vi is selected, then the set of all infinite sequences of natural numbers that have value vi at position i is a basic open set. Every open set is a countable union of a collection of these. Using more formal notation, one can define the individual cylinders as :C_n[v]= \\\\\\\\{(a_1,a_2,\\\\cdots) \\\\in \\\\omega^\\\\omega : a_n = v \\\\\\\\} for a fixed integer location n and integer value v. The cylinders are then the generators for the cylinder sets: the cylinder sets then consist of all intersections of a finite number of cylinders. That is, given any finite set of natural number coordinates I\\\\subseteq\\\\omega and corresponding natural number values v_i for each i\\\\in I, one considers the intersection of cylinders :\\\\bigcap_{i\\\\in I} C_i[v_i] This intersection is called a cylinder set, and the set of all such cylinder sets provides a basis for the product topology. Every open set is a countable union of such cylinder sets. By moving to a different basis for the same topology, an alternate characterization of open sets can be obtained: :If a sequence of natural numbers {wi : i < n} is selected, then the set of all infinite sequences of natural numbers that have value wi at position i for all i < n is a basic open set. Every open set is a countable union of a collection of these. Thus a basic open set in the Baire space is the set of all infinite sequences of natural numbers extending a common finite initial segment œÑ. This leads to a representation of the Baire space as the set of all infinite paths passing through the full tree œâ<œâ of finite sequences of natural numbers ordered by extension. Each finite initial segment is a node of the tree of finite sequences. Each open set is determined by a (possibly infinite) union of nodes of that tree. A point in Baire space is in an open set if and only if its path goes through one of the nodes in its determining union. The representation of the Baire space as paths through a tree also gives a characterization of closed sets. Every point in Baire space passes through a sequence of nodes of œâ<œâ. Closed sets are complements of open sets. Each closed set consists of all Baire sequences that do not pass through any node that defines its complementary open set. For any closed subset C of Baire space there is a subtree T of œâ<œâ such that any point x is in C if and only if x is a path through T. Conversely, the set of paths through any subtree of œâ<œâ is a closed set. Cartesian products also have an alternate topology, the box topology. This topology is much finer than the product topology as it does not limit the indicator set I=\\\\\\\\{i \\\\in \\\\omega \\\\\\\\} to be finite. Conventionally, Baire space does not refer to this topology; it only refers to the product topology.  Properties  The Baire space has the following properties: # It is a perfect Polish space, which means it is a completely metrizable second countable space with no isolated points. As such, it has the same cardinality as the real line and is a Baire space in the topological sense of the term. # It is zero-dimensional and totally disconnected. # It is not locally compact. # It is universal for Polish spaces in the sense that it can be mapped continuously onto any non-empty Polish space. Moreover, any Polish space has a dense GŒ¥ subspace homeomorphic to a GŒ¥ subspace of the Baire space. # The Baire space is homeomorphic to the product of any finite or countable number of copies of itself. # It is automorphism group of countably infinite saturated model M of some complete theory T.  Relation to the real line  The Baire space is homeomorphic to the set of irrational numbers when they are given the subspace topology inherited from the real line. A homeomorphism between Baire space and the irrationals can be constructed using continued fractions. That is, given a sequence (a_0,a_1,a_2, \\\\cdots)\\\\in \\\\omega^\\\\omega, we can assign a corresponding irrational number greater than 1 :x = [a_0+1;a_1+1,a_2+1,\\\\cdots] = (a_0+1)+\\\\frac{1}{(a_1+1)+\\\\frac{1}{(a_2+1)+\\\\cdots}} Using x \\\\mapsto \\\\frac{1}{x} we get another homeomorphism from \\\\omega^\\\\omega to the irrationals in the open unit interval (0,1) and we can do the same for the negative irrationals. We see that the irrationals are the topological sum of four spaces homeomorphic to the Baire space and therefore also homeomorphic to the Baire space. From the point of view of descriptive set theory, the fact that the real line is connected causes technical difficulties. For this reason, it is more common to study Baire space. Because every Polish space is the continuous image of Baire space, it is often possible to prove results about arbitrary Polish spaces by showing that these properties hold for Baire space and are preserved by continuous functions. œâœâ is also of independent, but minor, interest in real analysis, where it is considered as a uniform space. The uniform structures of œâœâ and Ir (the irrationals) are different, however: œâœâ is complete in its usual metric while Ir is not (although these spaces are homeomorphic). The shift operator The shift operator on Baire space, when mapped to the unit interval of the reals, becomes the Gauss- Kuzmin-Wirsing operator h(x)=1/x-\\\\lfloor 1/x \\\\rfloor. That is, given a sequence (a_1, a_2, \\\\cdots), the shift operator T returns T(a_1, a_2, \\\\cdots)=(a_2, \\\\cdots). Likewise, given the continued fraction x=[a_1, a_2, \\\\cdots], the Gauss map returns h(x)=[a_2, \\\\cdots]. The corresponding operator for functions from Baire space to the complex plane is the Gauss‚ÄìKuzmin‚ÄìWirsing operator; it is the transfer operator of the Gauss map.Linas Vepstas, \\"The Gauss-Kuzmin-Wirsing operator\\" (2004) That is, one considers maps \\\\omega^\\\\omega\\\\to\\\\mathbb{C} from Baire space to the complex plane \\\\mathbb{C}. This space of maps inherits a topology from the product topology on Baire space; for example, one may consider functions having uniform convergence. The shift map, acting on this space of functions, is then the GKW operator. The Haar measure of the shift operator, that is, a function that is invariant under shifts, is given by the Minkowski measure (...)^\\\\prime. That is, one has that (TE)^\\\\prime = E^\\\\prime, where T is the shift Linas Vepstas, \\"On the Minkowski Measure\\", (2008) arXiv:0810.1265 and E any measurable subset of œâœâ.

The Holocaust memorial museum is the fourth largest in the U.S., and opened in 1996. Holocaust Museum Houston is dedicated to remembering the 6 million Jews and other innocent victims of the Holocaust and honoring the legacy of the survivors. Using the lessons of the Holocaust and other genocides, they teach the dangers of hatred, prejudice and apathy. The museum promotes understanding, remembrance and education with the goal that both students and the general population stay and become aware of the lesson of these tragic events. This lesson is that humankind must strive to live together in peace and harmony. A major commitment of the Holocaust Museum Houston is education. The Boniuk Center physically and conceptually houses Holocaust Museum Houston‚Äôs Education Department. The physical space holds four classrooms, staff offices, storage rooms and a library. Holocaust Museum Houston Engines of Change Student Ambassador Program introduces Houston-area high school students to Holocaust history and enables them to better understand current issues and to develop their own informed opinions and voices. The Educator in Motion program is a free school and community outreach program that provides educational programming on the Holocaust, Genocide, Social Justice, and Active Citizenship in school and community settings. The Museum, working with colleagues from the Anti-Defamation League Southwest Region, and the Houston Police Department offers training for recruits, in- service and command-level law enforcement officers in this day-long session. Another educational resource the Museum offers are the Digital Curriculum Trunks. Each trunk contains a class set of iPad minis (30 total per trunk).  Facilities FIRST FLOOR Morgan Family Welcome Center The Museum‚Äôs patron‚Äôs first experience will include entry via the Morgan Family Welcome Center, complete with an orientation film and exhibition materials in both English and Spanish. Bearing Witness: A Community Remembers The permanent Holocaust Gallery is personalized with testimony of Holocaust Survivors who later settled in the Houston area, featuring artifacts donated by the Survivors, their descendants, liberators, and other collectors. The exhibit also educates visitors about Jewish and non-Jewish resistance efforts, including the Warsaw Ghetto uprising, prisoner revolts, sabotage, the partisan movement, displaced persons camps and life after the Holocaust. World War II-era Railcar and the 1940s Danish Rescue Boat The fishing boat like those used by Danish fishermen to ferry Jewish neighbors to neutral territory and the World War II-era railcar like the ones that transported Jews to concentration camps and killing centers are intentionally placed next to each other in the permanent Holocaust gallery to help teach visitors the continuing importance of each individual‚Äôs responsibility to act when confronted with injustice. As part of the Museum‚Äôs expansion, these rare artifacts were brought inside the permanent Holocaust Gallery to protect them from the elements. Dimensions in Testimony USC Shoah Foundation‚Äôs Dimensions in Testimony exhibition, featuring Houston-area Holocaust survivor William J. ‚ÄúBill‚Äù Morgan, allows visitors to have ‚Äúvirtual conversations‚Äù with Holocaust survivors by asking questions of their HD projections who then answer in real time via pre-recorded video images. Each specially recorded interview enables viewers to ask questions of the survivor about their life experiences and hear responses in real-time, lifelike conversation. Questions are answered naturally, as if the survivor is in the room, and through AI, the more questions asked the better the technology becomes. Dimensions in Testimony is housed in the permanent Holocaust Gallery. Human Rights Gallery The new Human Rights Gallery will feature educational displays of all UN-recognized genocides as well as tributes to international human rights leaders including Malala Yousafzai and Martin Luther King, Jr. among others. The exhibition encourages visitors to engage with one another, and the outside world, to understand their calling relative to these social ills and the choices that one single person can make to turn the tide and combat hatred and prejudice. The Rhona and Bruce Caress Gallery ‚Äì And Still I Write: Young Diarists on War and Genocide And Still I Write: Young Diarists on War and Genocide highlights the diaries of young people who wrote during war and genocide. The Gallery features six interactive diaries stations with 12 diarist stories rotating between them to educate visitors about the very personal stories of the Holocaust, as well as the existing dangers of hatred, prejudice and apathy. Visitors will be able to access and utilize these electronic diaries, providing them with the unique use of interactive, experiential technology. In addition, the Gallery will include a historical exhibit on Anne Frank. Two Changing Galleries The Museum also includes two changing galleries for art and photography exhibits. The Central Gallery is naturally located in the center of the Museum building. The Josef and Edith Mincberg Gallery is a larger hall for more extensive displays. The changing exhibits are designed to complement and further explore the issues presented in the permanent galleries. Lack Family Memorial Room Two other areas of Holocaust Museum Houston allow for reflection and meditation. The Lack Family Memorial Room is a quiet place for contemplation. It contains the three-part work of art comprising the Wall of Remembrance, the Wall of Tears and the Wall of Hope. The Memorial Wall is a place where local Holocaust survivors can commemorate their lost loved ones. Eric Alexander Garden of Hope Outside the Memorial Room is a quiet garden known as the Eric Alexander Garden of Hope. It is dedicated to the eternal spirit of children and is in memory of the one and a half million children who lost their lives in the Holocaust. SECOND FLOOR The Jerold B. Katz Family Butterfly Loft Suspended as if in flight, the Butterfly Loft sculpture is a kaleidoscope of 1,500 butterflies that connects all three floors of the Museum in an organically shaped swarm. Each butterfly represents 1,000 children and together are a memorial to the 1.5 million children who perished in the Holocaust. The Boniuk Center for the Future of Holocaust, Human Rights, and Genocide Studies ‚Äì Second Floor The Boniuk Center for the Future of Holocaust, Human Rights and Genocide Studies will provide a research and scholarly forum to consider how to best educate our community and others around the world about the history and memories of the Holocaust. In light of ongoing genocides and issues of human rights, the Center will provide a venue in which to consider values and how our work shapes society‚Äôs citizenry. The Center will explicate questions of morality and coexistence as these pertain to human behavior and decision-making. Samuel Bak Gallery The Museum will debut the nation's largest gallery of artwork by Holocaust survivor and painter Samuel Bak, with more than 130 works in exhibition rotation. The gallery itself is circular, continuously displaying the exceptional work of the artist while teaching children and adults to apply an understanding of the events of the Holocaust and other genocides to their own lives and respond to them successfully by developing social resiliency. THIRD FLOOR The Boniuk Library The expansion of The Boniuk Library, with more than 10,000 volumes and numerous resources for in-house research and education, allows for enhanced public access to its 285 oral testimonies for research purposes and genealogical searches. The Boniuk Library is one of the largest sources of data in the U.S. for communities that were destroyed occurred during the Holocaust. = Museum Relocation = Holocaust Museum Houston, Lester and Sue Smith Campus relocated to its new, permanent location in the Houston Museum District in June, 2019 after a $34 million expansion of its original building. By more than doubling in size to a total of , the new facility will rank as the nation's fourth largest Holocaust museum, and is fully bilingual in English and Spanish. The new three-story structure will house a welcome center, four permanent galleries and two changing exhibition galleries, classrooms, research library, caf√©, 200-seat indoor theater and 175-seat outdoor amphitheater. The exhibits now discuss overall history and other genocides. Some items had been temporarily moved to protect them during construction. They were the rescue boat \\"Hanne Frank\\" and a railcar. Moral Courage Award In 1994, HMH introduced the Lyndon Baines Johnson Moral Courage Award in memory of the 36th president of the United States. Recipients of this award are individuals who, like Johnson, exhibit moral courage, individual responsibility and the willingness to take action against injustice. The 2009 award honored U.S. Sen. John McCain for his heroism in the face of extreme adversity during the Vietnam War.

Upani·π£hads. Oxford University Press, 1998, pages 3‚Äì4 The Sanskrit language text is contained within the Shatapatha Brahmana, which is itself a part of the Shukla Yajur Veda. The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad is a treatise on ƒÄtman (Soul, Self), includes passages on metaphysics, ethics and a yearning for knowledge that influenced various Indian religions, ancient and medieval scholars, and attracted secondary works such as those by Adi Shankara and Madhvacharya .Brihadaranyaka Upanishad with Adi Shankara's commentary Swami Madhavananada (Translator)Brihadaranyaka Upanisad with the commentary of Madhvacharya, Translated by Rai Bahadur Sri≈õa Chandra Vasu (1933), Chronology The chronology of Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, like other Upanishads, is uncertain and contested.Stephen Phillips (2009), Yoga, Karma, and Rebirth: A Brief History and Philosophy, Columbia University Press, , Chapter 1 The chronology is difficult to resolve because all opinions rest on scanty evidence, an analysis of archaism, style and repetitions across texts, driven by assumptions about likely evolution of ideas, and on presumptions about which philosophy might have influenced which other Indian philosophies. Patrick Olivelle states, \\"in spite of claims made by some, in reality, any dating of these documents (early Upanishads) that attempts a precision closer than a few centuries is as stable as a house of cards\\". The chronology and authorship of Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, along with Chandogya and Kaushitaki Upanishads, is further complicated because they are compiled anthologies of literature that must have existed as independent texts before they became part of these Upanishads.Patrick Olivelle (2014), The Early Upanishads, Oxford University Press, , page 11-12 The exact year, and even the century of the Upanishad composition is unknown. Scholars have offered different estimates ranging from 900 BCE to 600 BCE, all preceding Buddhism. Brihadaranyaka is one of the first Upanishads, along with that of Jaiminiya Upanishad and Chandogya Upanishads.Olivelle, Patrick (1998), Upani·π£ads, Oxford University Press, , pages 10-17Fujii, M. 1997, ‚ÄúOn the Formation and Transmission of the Jaiminƒ´ya-Upani·π£ad-BrƒÅhma·πáa‚Äù, Inside the Texts, Beyond the Texts: New Approaches to the Study of the Vedas, ed. M. Witzel, Harvard Oriental Series, Opera Minora, 2], Cambridge, 89‚Äì102 The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad was in all likelihood composed in the earlier part of 1st millennium BCE, around 700 BCE, give or take a century or so, according to Patrick Olivelle.Patrick Olivelle (2014), The Early Upanishads, Oxford University Press, , page 12-13 It is likely that the text was a living document and some verses were edited over a period of time before the 6th century BCE. Etymology and structure Brihadaranyaka Upanishad literally means the \\"Upanishad of the great forests\\". Brihadaranyaka literally means \\"great wilderness or forest\\". The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad is credited to ancient sage Yajnavalkya, but likely refined by a number of ancient Vedic scholars. The Upanishad forms the last part, that is the fourteenth kƒÅnda of ≈öatapatha BrƒÅhmana of \\"≈öhukla Yajurveda\\". The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad has six adhyayas (chapters) in total. There are two major recensions for the text - the Madhyandina and the Kanva recensions. It includes three sections: Madhu kƒÅnda (the 4th and 5th chapter of the fourteenth kƒÅnda of Satapatha Brahmana), Muni kƒÅnda (or Yajnavalkya Kanda, the 6th and 7th chapter of 14th kƒÅnda of Satapatha Brahmana) and Khila kƒÅnda (the 8th and 9th chapter of the fourteenth kƒÅnda of Satapatha Brahmana).Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 389-397 The first and second chapters of the Upanishad's Madhu kƒÅnda consists of six brahmanas each, with varying number of hymns per brahmana. The first chapter of the Upanishad's Yajnavalkya kƒÅnda consists of nine brahmanams, while the second has six brahmanas. The Khila kƒÅnda of the Upanishad has fifteen brahmanas in its first chapter, and five brahmanas in the second chapter.Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 399-544 Content =First chapter= The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad starts by stating one of many Vedic theories of creation of the universe. It asserts that there was nothing before the universe started, then Prajapati created from this nothing the universe as a sacrifice to himself, imbued it with Prana (life force) to preserve it in the form of cosmic inert matter and individual psychic energy.Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, Chapter 1, Translator: S Madhavananda, pages 5-29 The world is more than matter and energy, asserts Brihadaranyaka, it is constituted also of Atman or Brahman (Soul, Self, Consciousness, Invisible Principles and Reality) as well as Knowledge. The Brahmana 4 in the first chapter, announces the Upanishad's non-dual, monistic metaphysical premise that Atman and Brahman are identical Oneness, with the assertion that because the universe came out of nothingness when the only principle existent was \\"I am he\\", the universe after it came into existence continues as Aham brahma asmi (I am Brahman).Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, Chapter 1, Translator: S Madhavananda, pages 92-118 In the last brahmana of the first chapter, the Upanishad explains that the Atman (soul) inspires by being self-evident (name identity), through empowering forms, and through action (work of a living being). The Soul, states Brihadaranyaka, is the imperishable one that is invisible and concealed pervading all reality. =Second chapter= The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad starts the second chapter as a conversation between Ajatashatru and Balaki Gargya on theory of dreams, positing that human beings see dreams entirely unto themselves because mind draws, in itself, the powers of sensory organs, which it releases in the waking state. It then asserts that this empirical fact about dreams suggests that human mind has the power to perceive the world as it is, as well as fabricate the world as it wants to perceive it. Mind is a means, prone to flaws. The struggle man faces, asserts Brihadaranyaka in brahmana 3, is in his attempt to realize the \\"true reality behind perceived reality\\". That is Atman-Brahman, inherently and blissfully existent, yet unknowable because it has no qualities, no characteristics, it is \\"neti, neti\\" (literally, \\"not this, not this\\"). In fourth brahmana, the Upanishad presents a dialogue between a husband and wife, as Yajnavalkya and Maitreyi, on nature of love and spirituality, whether and how is Atman related to deep connection and bonds between human beings. Yajnavalkya states that one doesn't connect with and love forms, nor does one connect or love mind, rather one connects with the Self, the Soul of one's own and one's beloved. All love is for the sake of one's Self, and the Oneness one realizes in the Self of the beloved.Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, Chapter 2 Section IV, Translator: S Madhavananda, pages 347-377 He then asserts that this knowledge of the Soul, the Self, the Brahman is what makes one immortal, the connection immortal. All longing is the longing for the Soul, because Soul is the true, the immortal, the real and the infinite bliss.Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 425-445 The fifth brahmana of the second chapter introduces the Madhu theory, thus giving this section of the Upanishad the ancient name Madhu Khanda. The Madhu theory is one of the foundational principles of Vedanta schools of Hinduism, as well as other ƒÅstika schools of Indian philosophies. Madhu literally means \\"honey\\", or the composite fruit of numerous actions on the field of flowers. In the Madhu theory, notes Paul Deussen, the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad asserts that \\"Atman exists\\" (soul exists), that all organic beings (plants, animals, human beings and gods) are wandering souls yet One with each other and the Brahman (Cosmic Soul); it further asserts that inorganic nature (fire, air, earth, water, space) is the field where the beings act, and where their numerous actions create fruits that they separately and together experience. The Upanishad then states that everything is connected, beings affect each other, organic beings affect the inorganic nature, inorganic nature affects the organic beings, one is the \\"honey\\" (result, fruit, food) of the other, everyone and everything is mutually dependent, nourishing and nurturing each other, all because it came from one Brahman, because it is all one Brahman, because all existence is blissful oneness.Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 437-443Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, Chapter 2 Section IV, Translator: S Madhavananda, pages 377-404 This theory appears in various early and middle Upanishads, and parallels Immanuel Kant's doctrine of \\"the affinity of phenomena\\" built on \\"the synthetic unity of apperception\\".Alan Jacobs (1999), The Principal Upanishads: The Essential Philosophical Foundation of Hinduism, Watkins, The last brahmanam of the Upanishad's first section is a Vamsa (generational line of teachers) with the names of 57 Vedic scholars who are credited to have taught the Madhu Khanda from one generation to the next.Max M√ºller, Brihad Aranyaka Upanishad The Sacred Books of the East, Volume 15, Oxford University Press =Third chapter= The third chapter is a metaphysical dialogue between ten ancient sages, on the nature of Reality, Atman and Mukti. Paul Deussen calls the presentation of ancient scholar Yajnavalkya in this chapter \\"not dissimilar to that of Socrates in the dialogues of Plato\\".Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 443-445 Among other things, the chapter presents the theory of perceived empirical knowledge using the concepts of graha and atigraha (sensory action and sense). It lists 8 combinations of graha and atigraha: breath and smell, speech and name (ideas), tongue and taste, eye and form, ear and sound, skin and touch, mind and desire, arms and work respectively. The sages debate the nature of death, asserts the third chapter of Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, and whether any graha and atigraha prevails after one dies. They rule out six, then assert that one's ideas (name) and one's actions and work (karma) continues to affect the universe.Max M√ºller, Brihad Aranyaka Upanishad The Sacred Books of the East, Volume 15, Oxford University PressPaul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 448-449 The fourth brahmana of the third chapter asserts, \\"it is your soul which is inside all\\", all souls are one, immanent and transcendent. The fifth brahmana states that profound knowledge requires that one give up showing off one's erudition, then adopt childlike curiosity and simplicity, followed by becoming silent, meditating and observant (muni), thus beginning the journey towards profound knowledge, understanding the soul of things where there is freedom from frustration and sorrow. In the sixth and eighth brahmana of the third chapter in Brihad Aranyaka Upanishad is the dialogue between Gargi Vachaknavi ‚Äì the female Vedic sage, and Yaj√±avalka, on the nature of universe.Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 450-457 The seventh brahmana discusses how and why the soul interconnects and has the oneness through all organic beings, all inorganic nature, all of universe. It asserts that the soul is the inner controller of beings, conflated with the interaction of nature, psyche and senses, often without the knowledge of beings. It is the soul, nevertheless, that is the true and essence, states the Upanishad.Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 457-465 The ninth brahmana, the longest of the third chapter, introduces the \\"neti, neti\\" principle that is discussed later, along with the analogical equivalence of physical features of a man and those of a tree, with the root of a man being his soul.Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 466-475Kausitaki Upanishad Robert Hume (Translator), Oxford University Press, pages 125-127 The last hymns of chapter 3 in Brihadaranyaka Upanishad also attest to the prevalent practice of the renouncing ascetic life by the time Brihadaranyaka Upanishad was composed in Vedic age of India, and it is these ascetic circles that are credited for major movements such as Yoga as well as the ≈õrama·πáa traditions later to be called Buddhism, Jainism and heterodox Hinduism.Geoffrey Samuel (2008), The Origins of Yoga and Tantra, Cambridge University Press, , page 8, Quote: such (yogic) practices developed in the same ascetic circles as the early ≈õrama·πáa movements (Buddhists, Jainas and Ajivikas), probably in around the sixth or fifth BCE. =Fourth chapter= The fourth chapter of Brihadaranyaka Upanishad starts as a dialogue between King Janaka and Yajnavalka. It explores various aspects of the \\"Soul exists\\" theory, its phenomenal manifestations, and its philosophical implications on soteriology. The Upanishad, in the first brahmanam of fourth chapter, states that the soul manifests in human life in six forms: Prajna (consciousness), Priyam (love and the will to live), Satyam (reverence for truth, reality), Ananta (endlessness, curiosity for the eternal), Ananda (bliss, contentness), and Sthiti (the state of enduring steadfastness, calm perseverance).Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 475-507 In the second brahmanam, the Upanishad explores the question, \\"what happens to soul after one dies?\\", and provides the root of two themes that play central role in later schools of Hinduism: one, of the concept of soul as individual souls (dualism), and second of the concept of soul being One and Eternal neither comes nor goes anywhere, because it is everywhere and everyone in Oneness (non-dualism). This chapter discusses the widely cited \\"neti, neti\\" (‡§®‡•á‡§§‡§ø ‡§®‡•á‡§§‡§ø, \\"not this, not this\\") principle towards one's journey to understanding soul. The second brahmanam concludes that soul exists is self-evident, soul is blissfully free, soul is eternally invulnerable, and soul is indescribable knowledge. The hymn 4.2.4 of Brihadaranyaka Upanishad is one of many instances in the ancient Sanskrit text where the characters involved in philosophical debate greet each other with Namaste (‡§®‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•á), a practice in the culture of India.Brihadaranyaka 4.2.4 S Madhavananda (Translator), pages 590-592 The third brahmanam of the fourth chapter discusses the premises of moksha (liberation, freedom, emancipation, self-realization), and provides some of the most studied hymns of Brihadaranyaka. Paul Deussen calls it, \\"unique in its richness and warmth of presentation\\", with profoundness that retains its full worth in modern times.Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 482 Max M√ºller translates it as follows, The fourth brahmanam continues to build the thematic description of Atman-Brahman (Self, Soul) and the state of self-realization as achieved. Yajnavalkya declares that Knowledge is Self, Knowledge is freedom, Knowledge powers inner peace. In hymn 4.4.22, the Upanishad states, \\"He is that great unborn Self, who consists of Knowledge, is surrounded by the Pr√¢nas (life-force), the ether within the heart. In it [Soul] there reposes the ruler of all, the lord of all, the king of all. He does not become greater by good works, nor smaller by evil works. He is the lord of all, the king of all things, the protector of all things. He is a bank and a boundary, so that these worlds may not be confounded. He who knows him [soul], becomes a Muni. Wishing for that world, mendicants leave their homes.\\" Max M√ºller and Paul Deussen, in their respective translations, describe the Upanishad's view of \\"Soul, Self\\" and \\"free, liberated state of existence\\" as, \\"[Self] is imperishable, for he cannot perish; he is unattached, for he does not attach himself; unfettered, he does not suffer, he does not fail. He is beyond good and evil, and neither what he has done, nor what he has omitted to do, affects him. (...) He therefore who knows it [reached self-realization], becomes quiet, subdued, satisfied, patient, and collected. He sees self in Self, sees all as Self. Evil does not overcome him, he overcomes all evil. Evil does not burn him, he burns all evil. Free from evil, free from spots, free from doubt, he became Atman-Br√¢hmana; this is the Brahma-world, O King, thus spoke Yagnavalkya.\\" The last brahmanam of the Upanishad's second section is another Vamsa (generational line of teachers) with the names of 59 Vedic scholars who are credited to have taught the hymns of Muni Khanda from one generation to the next, before it became part of Brihadaranyaka.Max M√ºller, Brihad Aranyaka Upanishad The Sacred Books of the East, Volume 15, Oxford University Press =Fifth and sixth chapters= The fifth and sixth chapters of Brihadaranyaka Upanishad are known as Khila Khanda, which literally means \\"supplementary section, or appendix\\".Max M√ºller, Brihad Aranyaka Upanishad The Sacred Books of the East, Volume 15, Oxford University Press Each brahmanam in the supplement is small except the fourteenth. This section, suggests Paul Deussen, was likely written later to clarify and add ideas considered important in that later age.Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 507 Some brahmanams in the last section of Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, such as the second and third brahmanam in fifth chapter, append ethical theories, while fourth brahmanam in the fifth chapter asserts that \\"empirical reality and truth is Brahman\\".Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 509-510 In the fourth brahmanam of sixth chapter, sexual rituals between a husband and wife are described to conceive and celebrate the birth of a child.Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 534-544 Discussion The Brihadaranyaka text has been an important Upanishad to the Vedanta scholars, and discusses many early concepts and theories foundational to Hinduism such as Karma, Atman and others. =Karma theory= One of the earliest formulation of the Karma doctrine occurs in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad.Tull, Herman W. The Vedic Origins of Karma: Cosmos as Man in Ancient Indian Myth and Ritual. SUNY Series in Hindu Studies. P. 28 For example: =Ethics= The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad includes hymns on virtues and ethics.S Wesley Ariarajah (1986), Hindu Spirituality, The Ecumenical Review, 38(1), pages 75-81Harold Coward (2003), Ethics and Nature in the World‚Äôs Religions, in Environment across Cultures, Wissenschaftsethik und Technikfolgenbeurteilung, Volume 19, , pp 91-109 In verse 5.2.3, for example, it recommends three virtues: self-restraint (‡§¶‡§Æ‡§É, Damah), charity (‡§¶‡§æ‡§®‡§Ç, Daanam), and compassion for all life (‡§¶‡§Ø‡§æ, Daya).PV Kane, Samanya Dharma, History of Dharmasastra, Vol. 2, Part 1, page 5 The first ethical precept of Brihadaranyaka Upanishad became the foundation of Yamas in various schools of Hinduism. In Yoga school, for example, the yamas as listed by Pata√±jali in Yogas≈´tra 2.30 are: # Ahi·πÉsƒÅ (‡§Ö‡§π‡§ø‡§Ç‡§∏‡§æ): restraint from initiating violence, harm, injury to other living beings by actions, words or in one's thoughtsJames Lochtefeld, \\"Yama (2)\\", The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 2: N‚ÄìZ, Rosen Publishing. , page 777Kaneda, T.

The Upanishad states a behavioral theory, linking action to nature, suggesting that behavioral habits makes a man, > According as one acts, so does he become. One becomes virtuous by virtuous > action, bad by bad action. ‚Äî Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 4.4.5Four facts of > Hinduism Ancient and medieval Indian scholars have referred to Brihadaranyaka Upanishad as a foundation to discuss psychological theories, the nature of psyche, and how body, mind and soul interact. For example, Adi Shankara in his commentary on the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad explains the relation between consciousness, the mind and the body.KR Rao (2005), Perception, cognition and consciousness in classical Hindu psychology. Journal of Consciousness Studies, 12(3), pages 3-30RH Trowbridge (2011), Waiting for Sophia: 30 years of conceptualizing wisdom in empirical psychology. Research in Human Development, 8(2), pages 149-164 Mind creates desire, asserts Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, with its basis in pleasure. Eye is the cause of material wealth, because it is through sight that wealth is created states the Upanishad, while ears are spiritual wealth, because it is through listening that knowledge is shared. The Upanishad suggests in the dialogue between Yajnavalkya and Maitreyi, husband and wife, that one does not love an object for the sake of the object but for the sake of the subject, the Self (the soul of the other person). =Metaphysics= Advaita Verse 1.3.28 acknowledges that metaphysical statements in Upanishads are meant to guide the reader from unreality to reality. The metaphysics of Brihadaranyaka Upanishad is non-dualism (Advaita). For instance, in verse 2.4.13 Yajnavalkya asserts that everything in the universe is the Self. The nature of reality or Self is described as consciousness-bliss in verse 3.9.28. Neti-neti or (not this‚Äînot this) is a method of emphasizing the discovery of the right, by excluding the wrong. The verse 5.1.1 states that the Universe, Reality and Consciousness is infinite. :‡§™‡•Ç‡§∞‡•ç‡§£‡§Æ‡§¶‡§É ‡§™‡•Ç‡§∞‡•ç‡§£‡§Æ‡§ø‡§¶‡§Ç ‡§™‡•Ç‡§∞‡•ç‡§£‡§æ‡§§‡•ç‡§™‡•Ç‡§∞‡•ç‡§£‡§Æ‡•Å‡§¶‡§ö‡•ç‡§Ø‡§§‡•á ‡•§ :‡§™‡•Ç‡§∞‡•ç‡§£‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§™‡•Ç‡§∞‡•ç‡§£‡§Æ‡§æ‡§¶‡§æ‡§Ø ‡§™‡•Ç‡§∞‡•ç‡§£‡§Æ‡•á‡§µ‡§æ‡§µ‡§∂‡§ø‡§∑‡•ç‡§Ø‡§§‡•á ‡•• :p≈´r·πáam ada·∏•, p≈´r·πáam ida·πÉ, p≈´r·πáƒÅt p≈´r·πáam udacyate :p≈´r·πáasya p≈´r·πáam ƒÅdƒÅya p≈´r·πáam evƒÅva≈õi·π£yate. :\\"That (Brahman) is infinite, and this (universe) is infinite. the infinite proceeds from the infinite. : (Then) taking the infinitude of the infinite (universe), it remains as the infinite (Brahman) alone.\\" :::::::::::::::::Translation by Swami Madhavananda \\"From infinite or fullness, we can get only fullness or infinite\\". The above verse describes the nature of the Absolute or Brahman which is infinite or full, i.e., it contains everything. Upanishadic metaphysics is further elucidated in the Madhu-vidya (honey doctrine), where the essence of every object is described to be same to the essence of every other object. The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad looks at reality as being indescribable and its nature to be infinite and consciousness-bliss. The cosmic energy is thought to integrate in the microcosm and in the macrocosm integrate the individual to the universe. =Different interpretations= The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad has attracted secondary literature and commentaries (bhasya) from many scholars. In these secondary texts, the same passages have been interpreted in different ways by the various sub-schools of Vedanta such as nondualistic Advaita (monism), dualistic Dvaita (theism) and qualified nondualistic Vishistadvaita.

The ratio of length and breadth of the flag is 3:2.  Membership  The Students' Federation of India in 202021 has 24 functioning state committees. Gujarat and a Unit in Central University of Gujarat Sikkim, Chhattisgarh and a unit in Central University of Jammu are newly formed committees. SFI is leading several student unions of universities in Himachal Pradesh, Delhi, Rajasthan, Gujarat, West Bengal, Tripura, Assam, Odisha, Maharashtra, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Bihar and Kerala. In 201415, its total membership was 4,300,405. Activities * SFI has protested against the National Education Policy, 2019, hike in fees, and under-representation of reserved students in IITs. * SFI members took part and organised multiple Citizenship Amendment Act protests in 2019. The SFI marched to the Parliament in one such protest. Further, the SFI even approached the Supreme Court against the act. * During the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in India, SFI distributed sanitary napkins to female students in West Bengal and demanded their inclusion in essential commodities in Himachal Pradesh. SFI set up COVID-19 helpline numbers in various states to help stranded students. To combat misinformation and reach out to the migrant labourers in various places, SFI launched a campaign named \\"My dear friend\\" where verified information from government sources are translated into various Indian languages and circulated through social media. Online art festivals, lecture series and online classes were also organised by various SFI committee's. SFI also produced face masks and hand sanitisers. * SFI had won court cases for regulating private coaching centres in India. SFI and DYFI activists jointly posted 1.5 lakh letters to the Prime Minister's office for lodged FIR against 49 artists who condemned the lynching of people and the activities of cow vigilantes. =Women in SFI= From 27‚Äì29 January 2017, the 5th All India Girls Convention was held at Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh and it elected a 23 member team of girls‚Äô sub-committee. Bleed Without Fear, Bleed Without Tax Protesting against the imposition of 12% tax on sanitary napkins, the women sub-committee of SFI protested nationwide in July 2017. The campaign was named \\"Bleed Without Fear, Bleed Without Tax\\". Petitions were submitted to the Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley for revoking the government decision. Thousands of girl students mailed sanitary napkins with protest slogans to Arun Jaitley's office. This campaign was similar to that of the Pink Chaddi Campaign in 2009. The campaign also demanded the installation of adequate sanitary napkin vending machines in schools and colleges and providing six packets of sanitary napkins for one rupee to the women below poverty line. All-women panels Female candidates of the SFI won all seats in a mixed college by fielding an all-women panel for students union elections in Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit, Kalady in 2017. An SFI member became the first Dalit woman to be elected as the chairperson in Maharaja's College, Ernakulam in 2017. In 2018, all-women SFI panels won in CMS College Kottayam and contested in Government Victoria College, Palakkad. In 2019, SFI members were elected as the first female chairpersons in Sacred Heart College, Thevara, Kochi, and the College of Engineering, Trivandrum (CET). Earlier, the SFI had organised protests of the female hostelites of CET in February 2019 for extending the curfew timings for girls' hostels. This movement forced the government to accept the demands and Dr Usha Titus, the Higher Education Secretary of Kerala Government issued orders to enforce them. GSCASH The idea of GSCASH (Gender Sensitisation Committee Against Sexual Harassment) was first experimented in Jawaharlal Nehru University by SFI's students union headed by Vijoo Krishnan in 1998‚Äì99. In September 2013, after the harassment of two women students of Pondicherry University, the SFI initiated a movement for GSCASH in the university and the activists approached Madras High Court for redressal. The movement later ended successfully with the High Court ordering university to constitute institutional mechanisms for grievances. In Assam, the Directorate of Higher Education (DHE) in 2018 ordered all colleges to set up GSCASH after the SFI's intervention.  Reception  In 2019, an informal probe by retired Justice PK Shamsudin, appointed to look into the discrepancies in college campus politics noted the anti-democratic activities of SFI in Kerala. However, the SFI denied these claims.

To have such an ability (and to convince an opponent of its viability) is considered vital in nuclear deterrence, as otherwise the other side might attempt to try to win a nuclear war in one massive first strike against its opponent's own nuclear forces. Theory The possession of second-strike capabilities counters a first-strike nuclear threat and can support a no first use nuclear strategy. Reciprocal second- strike capabilities usually cause a mutual assured destruction defence strategy, though one side may have a lower level minimal deterrence response. Second-strike capabilities can be further strengthened by implementing fail- deadly mechanisms. These mechanisms create a threshold and guaranteed consequences if that threshold is breached. For instance, a threshold may be for an allied nation not to be attacked. If a rival nation then breaches this threshold by attacking the allied nation, then the predetermined consequences for this action go into effect. These predetermined consequences could include a wide range of responses, including a retaliatory nuclear second strike. Implementation Trident II missile launched from a Royal Navy ballistic missile submarine The crucial goal in maintaining second-strike capabilities is preventing first-strike attacks from taking out a nation's nuclear arsenal. In this manner, a country can carry out nuclear retaliation even after absorbing a nuclear attack. The United States and other countries have diversified their nuclear arsenals through the nuclear triad in order to better ensure second-strike capability. Submarine-launched ballistic missiles are the traditional, but very expensive, method of providing a second strike capability, though they need to be supported by a reliable method of identifying who the attacker is. Using SLBMs as a second-strike capability has a serious problem, because in retaliation for a submarine-launched ICBM, the wrong country could be targeted, and can cause a conflict to escalate. However, implementation of second strikes is crucial to deter a first strike. Countries with nuclear weapons make it their primary purpose to convince their opponents that a first strike is not worth facing a second strike. Such countries have many diverse launch mechanisms, prepared responses to various nuclear attack scenarios, launch mechanisms in many different areas of the country, and underground launch facilities that are specifically designed to withstand a nuclear attack. Launch on warning is a strategy of nuclear weapon retaliation that gained recognition during the Cold War between the Western Bloc and the Eastern Bloc. In addition to the nuclear triad, nations deploy an early warning system that detects incoming nuclear missiles. This gives that nation the capability and option to launch a retaliatory second strike before the incoming nuclear first strike hits any of its targets. This is another method of solidifying second-strike capabilities and deterring a first strike from another nuclear power. Because of the low accuracy (circular error probable) of early-generation intercontinental ballistic missiles (and especially submarine-launched ballistic missiles), second strike was initially only possible against very large, undefended countervalue targets like cities. Later-generation missiles with much improved accuracy made second-strike counterforce attacks against the opponent's hardened military facilities possible. =Perimetr-PTS= Perimetr-PTS, otherwise known as –º–µ—Ä—Ç–≤–∞—è —Ä—É–∫–∞ (the Dead Hand) within Russia, is a Russian nuclear deterrence developed to automatically launch ballistic missiles as a retaliatory attack in the event that the Russian command and control system is destroyed in a surprise decapitation strike. Perimetr PTS dates back to 1974, in response to Soviet fears of devastating nuclear strikes from US Ballistic Missile submarines. It became operational in January 1985, with SS-17 launch silos in Vypolzovo (Yedrovo) and Kostroma, each 100 and 150 miles north-west of Moscow respectively. The system was built with multiple layers of redundancy, in case multiple layers of communications were destroyed in the initial strike. Launch authorization would be transmitted by UHF radio, by transmitters buried deep underground. Development continued over the years with the system incorporating the new RT-2PM2 Topol-M ICBMs in December 1990, and further refinements in 1996. Russian leadership was concerned that the system could trigger an accidental launch, so they incorporated numerous safeguards into its design. # Initially, both the Vyuga nuclear command link to Russian leadership and the secure Kazbek communications system must be interrupted. The simultaneous loss of both systems would indicate that the national command post has been destroyed and the political leadership killed. # Secondly, the General Staff would have had to escalate the threat level sufficiently high so that a preauthorisation for launch had already been attained prior to loss of communications. If this hadn't been received, it was up to the missile operators within the silos to abort the automated launch. # Third, the collective input of data from a variety of sensors fed into a central server. This included ground and infrared sensors designed to detect explosions around early-warning radar stations, command posts, and silos; missile signatures from radar stations, and data from the Oko early warning satellite system. Perimetr-PTS was deliberately designed not to launch in the event of a smaller strike from US allies or an Asian nuclear power, given their inability to wage 'total war'. It was also designed to discount the possibility of an earthquake or natural disaster, by referencing data from seismograph stations. Despite the automated launch capabilities, Russian nuclear command and control could order missiles to self-destruct mid-flight in the event of an accidental launch. Russian Ballistic Missile submarines were reportedly never incorporated into Perimetr-PTS, given the inherent communication issues which could ensue. History As early as 1940, science fiction writer Robert A. Heinlein wrote the science fiction short story Solution Unsatisfactory in which he described a nuclear arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union. In one episode, the US cabinet discusses the scenario of a Soviet surprise attack in which American cities would be destroyed, but the US armed forces would survive and launch a counter-attack.

Introduced in 1911, and designed by John G. Robinson, 126 were built for the GCR prior to the First World War. Including wartime construction for the British Army ROD and the post-war GCR Class 8M, the class and its derivatives totalled 666 locomotives. Great Central Railway GCR Class 8K (later LNER Class O4/1) loco 63664 at Langwith Junction engine shed on 7 August 1960 The first of the 8K class was outshopped from the GCR's Gorton workshops in 1911. It was essentially a superheated version of an earlier 0-8-0, the 8A class, with the addition of a pony truck. This both supported the greater front end weight and gave a steadier ride. The 8K was introduced to anticipate the increased traffic from the GCR's vast new docks complex at Immingham in North East Lincolnshire and by June 1914 126 were in traffic. During the First World War there were experiments with oil burning 8Ks with larger bogie tenders. Post-war, a further 19 locomotives were built in 1918‚Äì21 to a modified design with a larger boiler (GCR class 8M). In 1922 the GCR rebuilt two Class 8M to Class 8K. Railway Operating Division Robust and straightforward, the Class 8K 2-8-0 steamed well and proved outstandingly reliable, qualities that commended the design to the Ministry of Munitions. Sir Sam Fay ensured that it became the standard locomotive during the First World War as the ROD 2-8-0, used by the Railway Operating Division of the Royal Engineers. 521 ROD locomotives were built in 1917-19 to essentially the same design as the GCR's 8K locomotives, differing only in minor details, such as the fitting of Westinghouse Air Brakes and the use of steel for the boiler tubes and inner firebox. After the war, the surviving ROD locomotives were sold to various railway companies, with the GCR itself purchasing 3 in 1919, which were added to its indigenous 8K fleet. Other surplus ROD locomotives were sold to the London and North Western Railway (30 locomotives), its successor the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (75 locomotives, see LMS ex-ROD 2-8-0), the Great Western Railway (100 locomotives, see GWR 3000 Class), and to various purchasers in Australia and China. Many of these had short lives with their new owners ‚Äì the LMS locomotives were all scrapped or sold by the 1930s, and half of the GWR fleet was gone by 1930. However, other GWR engines survived well into the 1950s. The last of 13 locomotives sold to J & A Brown for use on the Richmond Vale railway line, in Australia, was retired in 1973, and 3 locomotives in China were only retired in 1990. LNER and BR ownership Upon its formation in 1923 the London and North Eastern Railway inherited a total of 131 class 8K and 17 class 8M locomotives from the Great Central Railway. Under the LNER's ownership the 8Ks became known as Class O4, and the 8Ms as Class O5, although all of the O5s were converted to Class O4s by 1946. They were joined by a further 273 former ROD locomotives purchased in 1923-27, bringing the total LNER O4 fleet to 421 locomotives. Some 92 of these were requisitioned by the War Department in 1941 for use in support of Commonwealth forces in the Middle East, none of which would return to Britain. The O4 locos served widely throughout the LNER system, many being modified to help extend their useful working life on heavy freight trains. Fifty-eight of the class were rebuilt into LNER Thompson Class O1s in 1944-49. 329 LNER O4 locomotives passed to British Railways ownership in 1948. Five locomotives were sold to the Government in 1952 for use in Egypt, and routine withdrawals of BR's class O4s commenced in December 1958. The last examples of the class were withdrawn from operations in the Doncaster area in April 1966, not long before the abandonment of steam altogether. Preservation Richmond Vale Railway in June 1973 One of the GCR-built 8Ks, BR number 63601 (originally GCR No. 102 built at Gorton in 1912), is preserved in Great Britain where it runs on the preserved Great Central Railway at Loughborough. There are also three ROD 2-8-0s (not used by the GCR or LNER) in New South Wales, Australia. Two are stored at the Dorrigo Steam Railway and Museum and one is being restored on the Richmond Vale Railway. Models In 2009 Bachmann Branchline announced a ready-to-run '00' scale model of the Class 8K, marketing it under the LNER class name of O4. The models being of preserved 63601, and 2 long-gone examples BR 63635 and LNER 6190, -these have since been released. In October 2012 RailSimulator.com released a pay-ware add-on of the GCR 8K, again marketed under its LNER O4 classification, for Train Simulator 2013. It was released as a companion to the Woodhead Line add-on, released earlier in the year, and features sounds from the preserved O4 63601 before its boiler ticket ran out, and includes 4 scenarios for the Woodhead Line and Quickdrive compatibility. In May of 2019, a new payware version of the GCR 8K was released for Train Simulator. It was released covering multiple variants of the locomotive. Including the GCR 8K, GWR 3000, LNER 04, LNWR ROD, CR ROD and the ROD version itself. The pack included a few Scenarios for the LNER 04 and GWR 3000 classes.

These rules were based on those drafted by England's Jack Broughton in 1743 and governed the conduct of prizefighting/bare-knuckle boxing for over 100 years. They \\"introduced measures that remain in effect for professional boxing to this day, such as outlawing butting, gouging, scratching, kicking, hitting a man while down, holding the ropes, and using resin, stones or hard objects in the hands, and biting.\\" They were later superseded by the Marquess of Queensberry Rules, the origins of the modern sport of boxing. Bare-knuckle boxer John L. Sullivan.  Scope  Fights under these rules were often contested with bare knuckles. The rules also allowed for a broad range of fighting including holds and throws of the opponent. Spiked shoes, within limits, were also allowed. Also included were provisions dealing with how wagers would be resolved if various events such as interference by the law, darkness, or cancellations occurred. In contrast with modern boxing rules based upon the Marquess of Queensberry Rules, a round ended with a man downed by punch or throw, whereupon he was given 30 seconds to rest and eight additional seconds to \\"come to scratch\\" or return to the centre of the ring where a \\"scratch line\\" was drawn and square off with his opponent once more. Consequently, there were no round limits to fights. When a man could not come to scratch, he would be declared loser and the fight would be brought to a halt. Fights could also end if broken up beforehand by crowd riot, police interference or chicanery, or if both men were willing to accept that the contest was a draw. While fights could have enormous numbers of rounds, the rounds in practice could be quite short with fighters pretending to go down from minor blows to take advantage of the 30-second rest period.  Fighters  Famous fighters of prize ring include William \\"Bendigo\\" Thompson, Tom Cribb, Jack Broughton, James \\"Deaf\\" Burke, \\"Professor\\" Mike Donovan, Tom Allen, Samuel \\"Dutch Sam\\" Elias, John \\"Gentleman\\" Jackson, the \\"Benicia Boy\\" John Carmel Heenan, Daniel Mendoza, Tom Molineaux, John \\"Old Smoke\\" Morrisey, Tom Sayers, Owen Swift, the \\"Trojan Giant\\" Paddy Ryan, Joe Goss, and James \\"Yankee Sullivan\\" Ambrose, Arhan \\"Hanuman Dragon\\" Deshmukh. England's last prize ring great was \\"gypsy\\" Jem Mace, and America's was John L. Sullivan‚Äîboth men fought under both sets of rules, with and without gloves and are considered bridges to the modern era of boxing. John L. Sullivan is the last fighter to have won a \\"world\\" championship under the London Prize Ring Rules in 1882 against Paddy Ryan and was the last champion to defend a title under the rules in 1889 against Jake Kilrain.  The rules  The rules of 1853 (which were somewhat different from the rules of 1838) were as follows: # That the ring shall be made on turf, and shall be four-and-twenty feet square, formed of eight stakes and ropes, the latter extending in double lines, the uppermost line being four feet from the ground, and the lower two feet from the ground. That in the centre of the ring a mark be formed, to be termed a scratch; and that at two opposite corners, as may be selected, spaces be enclosed by other marks sufficiently large for the reception of the seconds and bottle-holders, to be entitled ‚Äúthe corners.‚Äù # That each man shall be attended to the ring by a second and a bottle-holder, the former provided with a sponge and the latter with a bottle of water.

That the referee shall withhold all opinion till appealed to by the umpires, and that the umpires strictly abide by his decision without dispute. # That on the men being stripped, it shall be the duty of the seconds to examine their drawers, and if any objection arise as to insertion of improper substances therein, they shall appeal to their umpires, who, with the concurrence of the referee, shall direct what alterations shall be made. # That in future no spikes be used in fighting boots except those authorized by the Pugilistic Benevolent Association, which shall not exceed three-eights of an inch from the sole of the boot, and shall not be less than one-eight of an inch broad at the point; and, it shall be in the power of the referee to alter, or file in any way he pleases, spikes which shall not accord with the above dimensions, even to filing them away altogether. # That both men being ready, each man shall be conducted to that side of the scratch next his corner previously chosen; and the seconds on the one side and the men on the other, having shaken hands, the former shall immediately return to their corners, and there remain within the prescribed marks till the round be finished, on no pretence whatever approaching their principals during the round, under penalty of 5s. for each offence, at the option of the referee. The penalty, which will be strictly enforced, to go to the funds of the Association. The principal to be responsible for every fine inflicted on his second. # That at the conclusion of the round, when one or both of the men shall be down, the seconds and bottle-holders shall step forward and carry or conduct their principal to his corner, there affording him the necessary assistance, and no person whatever be permitted to interfere with this duty. # That at the expiration of thirty seconds (unless otherwise agreed upon) the umpire appointed shall cry ‚ÄúTime,‚Äù upon which each man shall rise from the knee of his bottle-holder and walk to his own side of the scratch unaided, the seconds and the bottle-holders remaining at their corner; and that either man failing so to be at the scratch within eight seconds, shall be deemed to have lost the battle. # That on no consideration whatever shall any person be permitted to enter the ring during the battle, nor till it shall have been concluded; and that in the event of such unfair practice, or the ropes and stakes being disturbed or removed, it shall be in the power of the referee to award the victory to that man who in his honest opinion shall have the best of the contest. # That the seconds and bottle-holders shall not interfere, advise, or direct the adversary of their principal, and shall refrain from all offensive and irritating expressions, in all respects conducting themselves with order and decorum, and confine themselves to the diligent and careful discharge of their duties to their principals. # That in picking up their men, should the seconds or bottle-holders wilfully injure the antagonist of their principal, the latter shall be deemed to have forfeited the battle on the decision of the referee. # That it shall be ‚Äúa fair stand-up fight,‚Äù and if either man shall wilfully throw himself down without receiving a blow, whether blows shall have previously been exchanged or not, he shall be deemed to have lost the battle; but that this rule shall not apply to a man who in a close slips down from the grasp of his opponent to avoid punishment, or from obvious accident or weakness. # That butting with the head shall be deemed foul, and the party resorting to this practice shall be deemed to have lost the battle. # That a blow struck when a man is thrown or down, shall be deemed foul. That a man with one knee and one hand on the ground, or with both knees on the ground, shall be deemed down; and a blow given in either of those positions shall be considered foul, providing always, that when in such position, the man so down shall not himself strike or attempt to strike. # That a blow struck below the waistband shall be deemed foul, and that, in a close, seizing an antagonist below the waist, by the thigh, or otherwise, shall be deemed foul. # That all attempts to inflict injury by gouging, or tearing the flesh with the fingers or nails, and biting, shall be deemed foul. # That kicking, or deliberately falling on an antagonist, with the knees or otherwise when down, shall be deemed a foul. # That all bets shall be paid as the battle-money, after a fight, is awarded. # That no person, on any pretence whatever, shall be permitted to approach nearer the ring than ten feet, with the exception of the umpires and referee, and the persons appointed to take charge of the water or other refreshment for the combatants, who shall take their seats close to the corners selected by the seconds. # That due notice shall be given by the stakeholder of the day and place where the battle-money is to be given up, and that he be exonerated from all responsibility upon obeying the direction of the referee; and that all parties be strictly bound by these rules; and that in future all articles of agreement for a contest be entered into with a strict and willing adherence to the letter and spirit of these rules. # That in the event of magisterial or other interference, or in case of darkness coming on, the referee shall have the power to name the time and place for the next meeting, if possible, on the same day, or as soon after as may be. # That should the fight not be decided on the day, all bets, instead of being drawn, shall be put together and divided, unless the fight shall be resumed the same week, between Sunday and Sunday, in which case the bets shall stand and be decided by the event. That where the day named in the articles for a fight to come off is altered to another day in the same week, the bets shall stand. The battle-money shall remain in the hands of the stakeholder until fairly won or lost by a fight, unless a draw be mutually agreed upon. # That any pugilist voluntarily quitting the ring previous to the deliberate judgment of the referee being obtained, shall be deemed to have lost the fight. # That on an objection being made by the seconds or umpire, the men shall retire to their corners, and there remain until the decision of the appointed authorities shall be obtained; that if pronounced ‚Äúfoul,‚Äù the battle shall be at an end, but if ‚Äúfair,‚Äù ‚Äútime‚Äù shall be called by the party appointed, and the man absent from the scratch in eight seconds after shall be deemed to have lost the fight.

He is a member of the AVN Hall of Fame and the XRCO Hall of Fame. Biography Thomas was born in Winnetka, Illinois to an upper-middle-class family. His father was of Greek-Jewish descent and his mother of Russian-Jewish descent. He is the nephew of businesswoman Sara Lee Lubin. Although he attended the University of Wisconsin at Madison on a basketball scholarship and studied political science, he turned to acting as a career. He began his acting career in the play Hair in both Chicago and New York. Then he appeared in the stage version of Jesus Christ Superstar on Broadway and in a touring production, where he played all the male roles except Peter. After completing the touring production, Norman Jewison cast him as Peter in his film version of Jesus Christ Superstar. He also performed in the long-running play Beach Blanket Babylon in San Francisco. He signed with the William Morris Agency and went to Hollywood, where he appeared in a few television shows. At this point, he appeared ready to start a career in mainstream television and movie work, but instead he turned to the career for which he would become more famous. Thomas started working in pornography in 1974. He met the porn producers the Mitchell Brothers while playing in a musical in San Francisco. He performed in several porn loops for them and, in 1976, appeared in his first porn feature, The Autobiography of a Flea. Thomas performed mostly using the stage name \\"Paul Thomas\\", but he has also appeared under several other names. In 1982 Thomas was arrested for smuggling cocaine into the United States from South America. Convicted, he served one year in jail. Following his release from prison, Toubus resumed his career and, in 1983, won the Adult Film Association of America Award for Best Actor in Virginia. He had a starring role in the 1985 film series Taboo American Style. Thomas started directing porn films in 1985, and has directed for Vivid Entertainment since 1986. Thomas has acted in over 500 films and directed nearly 300 films, winning seven Adult Video News Awards and two X-Rated Critics Organization Awards for best director. He was inducted into the X-Rated Critics Organization Hall of Fame in 1986. Thomas is a member of the Adult Video News Hall of Fame. He is a personal friend of Jennifer Ketcham, who recounts Thomas' directing style as relying heavily on aesthetics with \\"one-hundred-page scripts\\" and \\"deftly placed lighting\\" in order to create shadow effects on his performers' bodies. She also stated that Thomas would require more acting from his performers than many other directors in the industry.

Life Born at Paisley, Renfrewshire, the son of a successful merchant, he was educated at Paisley Grammar School before entering the Port-Eglinton Spinning Co. in 1811, an affiliation he was to maintain to the end of his life. His early involvement in Sunday School teaching led him to believe in the importance of effective training for teachers at all levels. His motto was \\"Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.\\"https://davidstow.org.uk/http://gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/mlemen/mlemen089.htm A leader of considerable ability and energy, in 1828, Stow set up his first day school in New City Road, Cowcaddens, Glasgow. Its success led to the establishment of the influential Glasgow Educational Society. In 1836, Stow established a Normal School for teacher training. The name was derived from the French word 'norma' meaning a rule or system. The Normal School existed to train teachers not to provide them with an education. Stow believed that his students should already possess the necessary education and knowledge of the curriculum they intended to teach. The school attracted students and observers from across the UK, including James Phillips Kay-Shuttleworth, education in England still being comparatively undeveloped at that stage. Teachers trained in Stow‚Äôs ‚Äòsystem‚Äô were sent out to schools throughout the United Kingdom and the Colonies taking his approach across the world. https://davidstow.org.uk/ Stow's school became part of the establishment and, following the Disruption of 1843, a legal ruling of 1845 held that the school was part of the Church of Scotland. Stow and most of his colleagues and students were adherents of the Free Church of Scotland; for this reason, they were compelled to resign from what had become state-funded teaching posts. Stow established a new college in Glasgow as the Free Church Normal Seminary.  The Glasgow System  The Glasgow System had been named \\"The Training System\\" by Stow. The system originated during the controversy over Bell-Lancaster method. Gladman, citing the British and Foreign School Society handbook, wrote \\"Failure occurred, as it always will, when masters were slaves to \\"the system,\\" when they were satisfied with mechanical arrangements and routine work, or when they did not study their pupils, and get down to Principles of Education.\\" Gladman goes on to write that Stow, a young merchant, who, in his anxiety to \\"stem the torrent of vice and ungodliness, turned his attention to the young,\\" and established a school on Sabbath evenings in the Saltmarket, \\"the very St. Giles of Glasgow,\\" in 1816. Gladman writes that Stow realised that the training of the street was more important than any individual. Adding to the institution Stow had started, he also formalised his method. \\"The Training System cultivates the whole nature of the child, instead of the mere head - the affections and habits, as well as the intellect.\\"https://davidstow.org.uk/ \\"The peculiarities of the Training System may be stated in one sentence, as - Picturing out in words, direct moral training, with suitable premises, and various practical methods by which these objects are accomplished, under well instructed and well trained masters or mistresses.\\" Honours *The David Stow Building of the University of Strathclyde is named for him. *Stow College (now Glasgow Kelvin College) in Glasgow was also named for him.

He also played an important role during the First World War as part of the Railway Executive Committee.  Early years  Samuel Fay was born in Hamble-le-Rice, on 30 December 1856. He was the second son of Joshua Fay (b. 1824 in Awbridge), a farmer of Hugenot origin, and Ann Philpott (b. 1820 in Eling). Fay was educated at Blenheim House school in Fareham.  Railway career  = L&SWR; = At the age of 15¬Ω Fay joined the London and South Western Railway. His first post was as a junior clerk at , from where he moved to Stockbridge on the Sprat and Winkle Line. After a 12-month period spent on the relief staff at various stations, Fay joined Kingston upon Thames where, in 1881, he launched the South Western Gazette together with two clerks in the general manager's office. The profits of the publication went to the L&SWR; Orphanage Fund. Two years later, Fay wrote his first book, A Royal Road, which was a brief history of the L&SWR.;Dow, p. 25. In 1884, Fay was transferred to Waterloo as second clerk in the Traffic Superintendent's office. After a few months he was promoted to chief clerk. He was subsequently considered for manager of the Waterford and Central Ireland Railway, but withdrew his candidature on account of the poor prospects of the job. He became Assistant Storekeeper at Nine Elms in 1891. In the same year, he was elected to Kingston Council, but this proved to be a short-lived experience.Dow, p. 26-27. = M&SWJ; = In early 1892, Fay was seconded to the Midland and South Western Junction Railway as Secretary and General Manager; at the time, the railway was in a poor condition, almost bankrupt and in the hands of a receiver. Within a period of twelve months, he had turned the situation around and restored the company to solvency, taking the place of the receiver. He also succeeded in promoting a bill for the Marlborough and Grafton Railway which completed the missing link between the two parts of the MSWJR, thereby avoiding the need to use the Great Western Railway's Berks & Hants Extension and Marlborough Railway from Savernake to Marlborough. = Great Central = Sam Fay c.1902 In 1899, Fay returned to Waterloo as the L&SWR;'s Superintendent of the Line. It was from here that he was appointed by Lord Faringdon, Chairman of the Great Central Railway, to succeed Sir William Pollitt as General Manager of the line in 1902. The Great Central was at that time in a precarious financial position due to the costs of constructing its London Extension, yet Fay was confident in his ability to repeat his performance with the M&SWJ.; He was to be paid ¬£3,000 per year and his contract was subject to six months notice on either side.Dow, p. 28. Presumably as a result of his experience with the M&SWJR;, Fay appears to have been head-hunted to become General Manager of the Great Central Railway. Whilst he was successful in maintaining the Great Central as an effective railway, Fay was not able completely to turn round the financial position of the company. One of his first decisions was to extend the operation of through passenger services between Newcastle and , supplemented by express excursions between Nottingham, Leicester and Bournemouth. Fay also reintroduced services between Sheffield and Leeds via the Swinton and Knottingley Joint Railway, as well as through services from Marylebone to Stratford-upon-Avon. Journey times for expresses between Marylebone and Sheffield were cut to 3 hours, a reduction of 8 minutes at an average speed of 54.9 mph. Fay introduced several notable innovations to the Great Central including the setting-up of a Publicity Department in 1902, and the rolling-out of the first weekly zone season tickets in Manchester in 1904. He was also responsible for the setting- up of the Great Central Railway Journal in 1905Dow, p. 32. and the initiation of competitive examinations in 1907 to create promotion opportunities for promising young members of staff.Dow, p. 82. Following his service with the War Office, Fay returned to the Great Central in May 1919.Dow, p. 296. The Great Central's Board of Directors held their final meeting before the railway grouping on 15 December 1922. It was agreed to award Fay a pension of ¬£3,000 per year.Dow, p. 347-348. = Other railway interests = In 1913, Fay became part-owner of the struggling Freshwater, Yarmouth and Newport Railway. He ran the line until the railway grouping and made a profit upon its disposal to the Southern Railway.Dow, p. 249. In 1924, Fay together with Sir Vincent Raven was appointed by the Government of New South Wales to the Royal Commission on the New South Wales Government Railways.Two British Knights come to Sydney Everett, Andrew Australian Railway History, November, 2005 pp. 464‚Äì473 The Commissioners reported in October 1924 that the metropolitan railway network was at saturation point and recommended the construction of a circular railway around Sydney, as well as the transfer of control over railway finances from the government to the Railway Commissioners. The construction of the City Circle line was subsequently commenced and a bill was passed amending the constitution of the Railway Commission.Gunn, p. 301-310. Fay held two Argentine railway directorships - the Buenos Aires Great Southern and Buenos Aires Western Railway Companies. In 1923, he replaced Stanley Jackson on the board of directors of Beyer, Peacock and Company, constructor of numerous Great Central locomotives,Dow, p. 353. of which he became Chairman on the retirement of Sir Vincent Caillard. For some time he also acted in an advisory capacity to the London and North Eastern Railway which had taken over the Great Central upon the railway grouping.Dow, p. 347. Had Fay not been of retirement age at the time of the grouping, he would have been a strong contender for becoming general manager of the new company. In the event, Sir Ralph Wedgwood was appointed to the position.Whitehouse and Thomas, p. 18.  Government work  = Committees = Fay served on two committees unconnected with railways - the Committee on Post Office wages in 1904 and the Departmental Committee on Inshore Fisheries in 1912. = First World War = Fay had, in 1911, been invited by the Secretary of State for War Richard Haldane to join the Ports and Transit Executive Committee bringing together the railway managers of six principal railway companies to examine the problem of feeding London in the event of enemy action on the south coast. Upon the outbreak of the First World War, Fay together with the eight other managers of leading railways became part of the Railway Executive Committee chaired by the LSWR's Herbert Walker.Bourne, p. 89-90. At the beginning of 1917, Fay took over the post of Director of Movements at the War Office, an experience which he was to write about in his book The War Office at War published in 1937; he refused to wear a military uniform or to remove his beard, even though his post carried the rank of general. In March 1918, he succeeded Sir Guy Granet, the Midland's General Manager, as Director-General of Movements and Railways, with a seat on the Army Council. During the period of his absence from the Great Central, Fay's assistant, E.A. Clear, took charge of the day-to-day running of the system.Dow, p. 297. = Grouping proposals = In December 1918, he had proposed to the coalition government the creation of a \\"Transport Authority\\" which would be composed of the representatives of railway and dock companies, the Board of Trade, trade unions and agricultural and industrial bodies. The Authority would acquire, using public stock, the capital of the country's railways and canals, and divide their operations into five regional groups which the Authority could take over and control in the public interest. The Prime Minister, David Lloyd George, had previously dealt with Fay in 1906, when he adopted the latter's plans for a conciliation system to settle industrial disputes on the railways. Although the power of nationalisation was withdrawn in the face of opposition in Parliament, an Act came into force on 15 August 1919 which created the Ministry of Transport headed by Sir Eric Geddes.Bagwell, p. 228-234.  Personal life  In 1883, Fay married Frances Ann Farbrother (b. 1856 or 1857 in Kingston), with whom he had four daughters and four sons, including Edgar Fay, the judge. A heavy cigar-smoker,Dow, p. 27. he lived in Cirencester, Gerrards Cross and finally Awbridge Danes near Romsey in Hampshire. In June 1902 he was gazetted a Lieutenant-Colonel in The Engineer and Railway Volunteer Staff Corps, and re-gazetted at the same rank when E&RVSC; became the Engineer and Railway Staff Corps of the Royal Engineers in April 1908. He received the Territorial Decoration in October 1920, and resigned his commission in January 1924. Fay was knighted by King George V in somewhat theatrical fashion during the royal opening of the Immingham Dock on 22 July 1912. In 1944, he published a small volume of poems and essays. Fay died in Awbridge on 30 May 1953, seven years after his wife, who had died on 10 July 1946. He is buried in the churchyard of All Saints Church.Swindon's Other Railway He had intended to write his memoirs but never got beyond the stage of rough notes.Dow, p. 354.  Legacy  Fay had a Great Central locomotive named in honour of his 1912 knighthood, the locomotives in the class becoming known informally as \\"Sam Fays\\".http://www.lner.info/locos/B/b2b19.shtml A bar/restaurant named Sam Fay's complete with railway memorabilia operated from the former Nottingham High Level station ticket office during the mid/late 1990s,https://www.flickr.com/photos/nickbeee/3285203877http://www.disused- stations.org.uk/n/nottingham_london_road_high_level/ although the station had always been on the Great Northern railway network until the LNER grouping in 1923.

The Roman force, led by Consul Lucius Licinius Lucullus, defeated Tigranes, and as a result, captured Tigranes' capital city of Tigranocerta. The battle arose from the Third Mithridatic War being fought between the Roman Republic and Mithridates VI of Pontus, whose daughter Cleopatra was married to Tigranes. Mithridates fled to seek shelter with his son-in-law, and Rome invaded the Kingdom of Armenia. Having laid siege to Tigranocerta, the Roman forces fell back behind a nearby river when the large Armenian army approached. Feigning retreat, the Romans crossed at a ford and fell on the right flank of the Armenian army. After the Romans defeated the Armenian cataphracts, the balance of Tigranes' army, which was mostly made up of raw levies and peasant troops from his extensive empire, panicked and fled, and the Romans remained in charge of the field. Background Tigranes' expansion into the Near East led to the creation of an Armenian empire that stretched almost across the entire region. With his father-in-law and ally securing the empire's western flank, Tigranes was able to conquer territories in Parthia and Mesopotamia and annex the lands of the Levant. In Syria, he began the construction of the city of Tigranocerta (also written Tigranakert), which he named after himself, and imported a multitude of peoples, including Arabs, Greeks, and Jews, to populate it. The city soon became the king's headquarters in Syria and flourished as a great centre for Hellenistic culture, complete with theatres, parks and hunting grounds. This period of Armenian hegemony in the region, however, was coming close to an end with a series of Roman victories in the Roman‚ÄìMithridatic Wars. Friction between the two had existed for several decades, although it was during the Third Mithridatic War that the Roman armies under Lucullus made significant progress against Mithridates, forcing him to take refuge with Tigranes. Lucullus sent an ambassador named Appius Claudius to Antioch to demand that Tigranes surrender his father-in-law; should he refuse, Armenia would face war with Rome.Sherwin-White. \\"Lucullus\\", p. 239. Tigranes refused Appius Claudius' demands, stating that he would prepare for war against the Republic. Lucullus was astonished upon hearing this in the year 70, and he began to prepare for an immediate invasion of Armenia. Although he had no mandate from the Senate to authorize such a move, he attempted to justify his invasion by distinguishing as his enemy king Tigranes and not his subjects. In the summer of 69, he marched his troops across Cappodocia and the Euphrates river and entered the Armenian province of Tsop'k', where Tigranocerta was located. Siege of Tigranocerta Tigranes the Great's empire circa 80 BC Tigranes, who was residing at Tigranocerta in the summer of 69, was not only astonished by the speed of Lucullus' rapid advance into Armenia but by the fact that he had even launched such an operation in the first place. Unable to reconcile with this reality for a certain period of time, he belatedly sent a general named Mithrobarzanes with 2,000‚Äì3,000 cavalrymen to slow down Lucullus' advance, but his forces were cut to pieces and routed by the 1,600 cavalry led by Sextilius, one of the legates serving under Lucullus. Learning of Mithrobarzanes' defeat, Tigranes entrusted the defence of his namesake city to Mancaeus and left to recruit a fighting force in the Taurus Mountains.Plutarch. Life of Lucullus, 25.5. Lucullus' legates were able to disrupt two separate detachments coming to the aid of Tigranes, and even located and engaged the king's forces in a canyon in the Taurus. Lucullus chose not to pursue Tigranes while he had an unimpeded path towards Tigranocerta; he advanced and began to lay siege to it.Plutarch. Life of Lucullus, 26.1. Tigranocerta was still an unfinished city when Lucullus laid siege to it in the late summer of 69. The city was heavily fortified and according to the Greek historian Appian, had thick and towering walls that stood 25 meters high, providing a formidable defence against a prolonged siege.Appian. The Mithrdatic Wars, 12.84. The Roman siege engines that were employed at Tigranocerta were effectively repelled by the defenders by the use of naphtha, making Tigranocerta, according to one scholar, the site of \\"perhaps the world's first use of chemical warfare.\\" However, since Tigranes had forcibly removed many of its inhabitants from their native lands and brought them to Tigranocerta, their allegiance to the king was cast into doubt. They soon proved their unreliability: when Tigranes and his army appeared on a hill overlooking the city, the inhabitants \\"greeted his [Lucullus] appearance with shouts and din, and standing on the walls, threateningly pointed out the Armenians to the Romans.\\"Plutarch. Life of Lucullus, 27.1. Forces Appian claims that Lucullus had embarked from Rome with only a single legion; upon entering Anatolia to make war against Mithridates, he added four more legions to his army. The overall size of this force consisted of 30,000 infantry and 1,600 cavalry.Appian. The Mithrdatic Wars, 12.72. Following Mithridates' retreat to Armenia, Appian estimates Lucullus' invading force to be only two legions and 500 horsemen,Appian. The Mithrdatic Wars, 12.84. although it is highly improbable that he would have undertaken the invasion of Armenia with such a small army.Ueda-Sarson, Luke. Tigranocerta: 69 BC. June 20, 2004. Accessed June 12, 2008. Plutarch gave 16,000 heavy infantry and 1,000 cavalry, slingers and archers for the Romans at Tigranocerta. Of these, 6,000 heavy infantry did not participate in the battle.Plutarch. Life of Lucullus, 27.2. Eutropius put the Roman army at 18,000 men.Eutropius 6.9 Historian Adrian Sherwin-White places the size of Lucullus' force at 12,000 seasoned legionaries (composed of three legions), and 4,000 provincial cavalry and light infantry.Sherwin-White. \\"Lucullus\\", p. 240. The Roman army was further bolstered by several thousand allied Galatian, Thracian, and Bithynian infantry and cavalry, giving it a possible strength of 40,000. Tigranes' army clearly held a numerical superiority over that of Lucullus'. According to Appian, it numbered 250,000 infantry and 50,000 cavalry.Appian. The Mithrdatic Wars, 12.85. According to Plutarch, Lucullus stated in a letter to the senate to have fought 20,000 slingers and archers, 55,000 cavalry, including 17,000 armoured with mail, 150,000 heavy infantry and 35,000 non-combatants for a total of 225,000 soldiers and 35,000 non- combatants.Plutarch. Life of Lucullus, 26.5. Eutropius went further, claiming 600,000 Armenian cataphracts and 100,000 infantry.Eutropius 6.9 Memnon of Heraclea gave a more modest 80,000 infantry and cavalry.Memnon History of Heracleia, 38.4 Phlegon of Tralles says Tigranes had 70,000 men, including 30,000 cavalry and 40,000 infantry.Phlegon, fragment 12.10 Many scholars, however, doubt these figures accurately reflect the true number of Tigranes' army and believe they are highly inflated.Cowan and Hook. Roman Battle Tactics, p. 41. Some historians, most notably Plutarch, wrote that Tigranes considered Lucullus' army far too small, and upon seeing it, is quoted as saying \\"If they come as ambassadors, they are too many; if they are soldiers, too few,\\"Plutarch. Life of Lucullus, 27.4. although some have expressed doubt on the veracity of this quote.Kurkjian, Vahan (1958). A History of Armenia. New York: Armenian General Benevolent Union of America, p. 80. In 1985, Ruben Manaseryan estimated Tigranes' army at 80,000‚Äì100,000 men. Manaseryan, Ruben. ¬´’è’´’£÷Ä’°’∂’°’Ø’•÷Ä’ø’´ ’≥’°’Ø’°’ø’°’¥’°÷Ä’ø ’Ñ.‘π.‘±. 69¬ª (Battle of Tigranakert, 69 BC). Armenian Soviet Encyclopedia. vol. xi. Yerevan: Armenian Academy of Sciences, 1985, p. 700. Tigranes also possessed several thousand cataphracts, formidable heavily armoured cavalry that were clad in mail armour and armed with lances, spears or bows. Disposition and engagement The commander of the Roman Senate army, Lucius Licinius Lucullus. The two armies converged toward the Batman-Su river slightly to the south-west of Tigranocerta.The precise location of the battle has remained a source of dispute. Appian and Plutarch remark that the battlefield was close enough for the garrison commander of Tigranocerta to make out the figures of the armies; however, according to T. Rice Holmes, the site of the battlefield was roughly sixteen miles to the southwest of the city. Holmes restricts the location of the battle to three contemporary sites: Arzen, Farkin, and Tell Ermen. See T. Rice Holmes, \\"Tigranocerta.\\" Journal of Roman Studies, vol. vii, 1917, pp. 136‚Äì138. Tigranes' army was positioned on the east bank of the river while Lucullus, who had left a rear guard of 6,000 heavy infantry under Murena to continue the siege of the city, met the Armenian army on the river's west bank.Plutarch. Life of Lucullus, 27.2. The Armenian army was formed of three sections. Two of Tigranes' vassal kings led the left and right flanks, while Tigranes led his cataphracts in the centre. The rest of his army stood in front of a hill, a position Lucullus soon exploited. Roman troops at first attempted to dissuade Lucullus from engaging in battle, since October 6 marked the day of the disastrous battle of Arausio, where the general Quintus Servilius Caepio and his Roman army were delivered a crushing defeat by the Germanic Cimbri and Teuton tribes. Ignoring his troops' superstitious beliefs, Lucullus is said to have responded, \\"Verily, I will make this day, too, a lucky one for the Romans.\\"Plutarch. Life of Lucullus, 27.7. Cowan and Hook suggest that Lucullus would have deployed the Romans in a simplex acies, that is to say a single line, so making the frontage of the army as wide as possible as a counter to the cavalry. He took several of his troops downriver, where the river was the easiest to ford, and at one point, Tigranes believed that this move meant Lucullus was withdrawing from the battlefield.Plutarch. Life of Lucullus, 27.5. One of Mithirdates' commanders, Taxil√©s, who accompanied Tigranes, informed the Armenian king that, \\"When these men are merely on the march, they do not put on gleaming armour, nor have their shields polished and helmets uncovered as they have now, taken the leather covers from their armour. No, this splendor means they are going to fight, and are now advancing on their enemies.\\" Quoted in Cowan and Hook. Roman Battle Tactics, p. 42. Lucullus had initially decided to make a running charge with his infantry, a Roman military tactic that minimized the amount of time an enemy could utilize its archers and sling infantry prior to close combat engagement.Cowan and Hook. Roman Battle Tactics, p. 42. However, he decided against this at the last moment when he realized that the Armenian cataphracts posed the greatest threat to his men, ordering instead a diversionary attack with his Gallic and Thracian cavalry against the cataphracts. With the cataphracts' attention fixed elsewhere, Lucullus formed two cohorts into maniples and then ordered them to ford the river.Rice. \\"Tigranocerta\\", p. 136. His objective was to outflank Tigranes' cataphracts by circling counterclockwise around the hill and attacking them from the rear.Plutarch. Life of Lucullus, 28.1‚Äì3. Lucullus personally led the charge on foot and upon reaching the top of the hill, he yelled to his soldiers in an effort to buoy their morale: \\"The day is ours, the day is ours, my fellow soldiers!\\"Plutarch. Life of Lucullus, 28.3. With this, he gave special instructions to the cohorts to attack the horses' legs and thighs, since these were the only areas of the cataphracts which were not armoured.Plutarch. Life of Lucullus, 28.4.Sherwin-White. \\"Lucullus\\", p. 241. Lucullus charged downhill with his cohorts and his orders soon proved decisive: the lumbering cataphracts were caught by surprise and, in their attempts to break free from their attackers, careered into the ranks of their own men as the lines began to collapse.Plutarch. Life of Lucullus, 28.4‚Äì5. The infantry, which was also made up of many non-Armenians, began to break ranks and confusion spread to the rest of the body of Tigranes' army. While the great king himself took to flight with his baggage train northwards, the entire line of his army gave way. Aftermath and legacy With no army left to defend Tigranocerta, and a foreign populace that gleefully opened the gates to the Romans, Lucullus' army began the wholesale looting and plunder of the city.Plutarch. Life of Lucullus, 29.3. The city was burned. The king's treasury, estimated to be worth 8,000 talents,Kurkjian. History of Armenia, p. 81. was looted and each soldier in the army was awarded 800 drachma. The battle also resulted in severe territorial losses: most of the lands in Tigranes' empire to the south of the Taurus fell under the sway of Rome. Despite the heavy losses Tigranes suffered, the battle did not end the war. In retreating northwards, Tigranes and Mithridates were able to elude Lucullus' forces, though losing again against the Romans during the battle of Artashat. Kurdoghlian, Mihran (1994). Badmoutioun Hayots, Volume I (History of the Armenians). Athens, Greece: Hradaragoutioun Azkayin Oussoumnagan Khorhourti, pp. 67‚Äì76. In 68, Lucullus' forces began to mutiny, longing to return home, and he withdrew them from Armenia the following year.Sherwin-White. \\"Lucullus\\", p. 243. The battle is highlighted by many historians specifically because Lucullus overcame the numerical odds facing his army. The Italian philosopher Niccol√≤ Machiavelli remarked upon the battle in his book, The Art of War, where he criticised Tigranes' heavy reliance on his cavalry over his infantry. =Casualties= The casualties reported for Tigranes' army are immense, with estimates given from 10,000 to as many as 100,000 men. Phlegon counted 5,000 dead and 5,000 captured.Phlegon, fragment 12.10 Orosius gave 30,000 losses, while Plutarch upped them to 100,000 infantry slain and the entire cavalry force wiped out save for a handful.Orosius 6.7.6Plutarch. Life of Lucullus, 28.6. Plutarch says that on the Roman side, \\"only a hundred were wounded, and only five killed,\\"Plutarch. Life of Lucullus, 28.6. although such low figures are highly unrealistic.Chahin. Kingdom of Armenia, p. 201. Cowan and Hook, while considering these losses ridiculous, think it is clear that the battle was won with disproportionate losses.Cowan and Hook. Roman Battle Tactics, p. 43.

British Railways Westbound freight struggling up Worsborough Bank approaching West Silkstone Junction headed by an ex-LNER Class O4, ex-GCR Class 8K The surviving 329 Class O4 locomotives passed to British Railways (BR) on 1 January 1948. They were then widely operated on freight trains throughout the Eastern and North Eastern regions of BR. The locomotives were given BR numbers in the range 63570-63920 but this range included 58 locomotives which had been rebuilt as Class O1. Withdrawal of O4 engines by BR commenced in 1959 and the last was taken out of service in the Doncaster area in April 1966.  Preservation  An O4/1, GCR No. 102, BR No. 63601, is part of the extensive National Collection, and is preserved on the preserved Great Central Railway at Loughborough, Leicestershire. A further three Robinson 2-8-0s were exported and survive in preservation in New South Wales, Australia.

Life Athenodorus was born in Canana, near Tarsus (in modern-day Turkey); his father was Sandon.Strabo, xiv. 14 He was a student of Posidonius of Rhodes, and the teacher of Octavian (the future Caesar Augustus) at Apollonia. He was a personal friend of Strabo, from whom we derive some knowledge of his life. In 44 BC, he seems to have followed Octavian to Rome and continued mentoring him there. He is reputed there to have openly rebuked the Emperor, and to have instructed him to recite the alphabet before reacting in anger. Later, Athenodorus returned to Tarsus, where he was instrumental in expelling the government of Bo√´thus and drafting a new constitution for the city, the result of which was a pro-Roman oligarchy. Athenodorus is also written of by Pliny the Younger, who tells us of Athenodorus' renting of a haunted house in Athens. Athenodorus was wary because the house was exceptionally cheap for its size. When Athenodorus was writing a book of philosophy, late at night, a ghost is said to have come to him. The ghost, who was bound with chains, beckoned Athenodorus to follow him, leading him to a courtyard, where the ghost suddenly vanished. Athenodorus marked the spot, and the next day, with the permission of the city magistrates, he dug up the earth from that spot, where he found the skeleton of an old man, bound with chains. After the skeleton was given a proper burial, the ghost was said to have never haunted that house again. Works Strabo, Cicero, and Eusebius regarded him highly. Works attributed to Athenodorus include: * A work against the Categories of Aristotle (although this is sometimes credited to Athenodoros Cordylion). * A history of Tarsus. * A work of some kind dedicated to Octavia Minor.Plutarch: Life of Publicola 17. * A work entitled œÄŒµœÅ·Ω∂ œÉœÄŒøœÖŒ¥·øÜœÇ Œ∫Œ±Œπ œÄŒ±ŒπŒ¥ŒµŒØŒ±œÇ (\\"On zeal and education\\"). * A work entitled œÄŒµœÅŒØœÄŒ±œÑŒøŒπ (\\"Perambulations\\"). None of these are extant, but he also assisted Cicero in writing his De Officiis and it has been suggested that his work may have influenced Seneca and Saint Paul. Following his death, the people of Tarsus held an annual festival and sacrifice in his honour.

The boot image is a view of the objects Jikes RVM requires to boot created using reflection in the bootstrap JVM. A small C loader is responsible for loading the boot image at runtime. VM Magic VM Magic is where the compiler generates different code for a class than the bytecodes within that class should perform. VM Magic classes allow direct access to memory and are key to the Memory Management Toolkit's performance. The VM Magic classes reside in the org.vmmagic package and have been reused in other Java projects. Memory Management Toolkit The Memory Management Toolkit (MMTk) is a set of precise garbage collectors that have been used within Jikes RVM and other projects such as the Singularity operating system and the Shared Source Common Language Infrastructure (SSCLI, formerly named Rotor). As with the rest of the Jikes RVM, the implementation is in Java, but the main dependence is on VM Magic. Class libraries Either Apache Harmony or GNU Classpath class libraries can be used with Jikes RVM, with experimental support for OpenJDK's class library. Compilers Jikes RVM uses a fast baseline compiler to quickly generate code for a given architecture. Adaptive compiling then recompiles code with an optimizing compiler with features such as on-stack replacement (OSR). The adaptive compiling system uses a cost- benefit analysis model. Runtime Jikes RVM's runtime has many innovative features including mechanisms for fast locking, collaborative scheduling, and support for fast exception gathering and dispatch. Processors Jikes RVM supports PowerPC (or ppc) and IA-32 (or Intel x86, 32-bit) instruction set processor architectures.

Life and career =Early life= Wilson was born and raised Roman Catholic in McAlester, Oklahoma. He graduated from UC Berkeley with a bachelor's degree in philosophy in 1936 and did post-graduate fellowship work between 1937 and 1939. He taught English and began his writing career with short stories for magazines. Then, starting in 1941, he wrote or co-wrote 22 screenplays. =Early Screenplays= Wilson was credited on The Men in Her Life (1941) with Loretta Young. He did some William Boyd westerns, Border Patrol (1943), Colt Comrades (1943), Bar 20 (1943), and Forty Thieves (1944). Wilson's career in Hollywood was interrupted by service with the United States Marine Corps during World War II. =Return from World War Two= In 1945 he became a contract writer with Liberty Films, working (uncredited) on such pictures as It's a Wonderful Life (1946). He was a co- winner of the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for A Place in the Sun (1951), and won an Edgar Award and another Oscar nomination for his script for 5 Fingers (1953). =Blacklisting= Wilson was named an unfriendly witness by the House Un-American Activities Committee and blacklisted for being a communist. After he was blacklisted, he left for France and worked on scripts for the European film industry. While blacklisted, Wilson wrote the script for Salt of the Earth (1954), a fictionalized account of a real strike by zinc miners in Grant County, New Mexico. The movie was directed by Herbert Biberman and produced by Paul Jarrico both of whom had also been blacklisted. The film has been deemed \\"culturally significant\\" by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. He wrote or collaborated on scripts for Hollywood films without credit or under a pseudonym for much less than his usual fee before being blacklisted, including Carnival Story (1954) (for King Brothers Productions who often used blacklisted writers); They Were So Young (1954); The Court-Martial of Billy Mitchell (1955), for Otto Preminger; Friendly Persuasion (1956), for William Wyler; The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957), for Sam Spiegel and David Lean; The Two-Headed Spy (1958); Tempest (1958) and 5 Branded Women (1960) for Dino De Laurentiis; and Lawrence of Arabia (1962) for Spiegel and Lean again. His screenplay for Friendly Persuasion was nominated for an Academy Award, but was disqualified because his name did not appear in the credits. Director William Wyler wanted his brother, Robert Wyler, and Jessamyn West credited for rewriting the script, but Wilson disputed this. Wyler then was able under the rules of the blacklist to have one of the few films in history credited to no writer at all. Wilson and Carl Foreman worked separately on The Bridge on the River Kwai, but as both were blacklisted, the official credit went to Pierre Boulle, upon whose novel the movie was based, even though Boulle did not even speak English. Wilson remained in France with his family for nine years, before returning to live in Ojai, California in the United States in 1964. =Return to Hollywood= Wilson continued to write screenplays, including for The Sandpiper (1965), Planet of the Apes (1968), and Che! (1969). His screenplay for Planet of the Apes was based on a novel by Pierre Boulle; only Boulle received screen credit. Michael Wilson was awarded Writers Guild of America's Laurel Award in 1975 and was posthumously awarded his second Academy Award in 1984 for The Bridge on the River Kwai. In 1995, Wilson was credited by the academy's board of directors with an Academy Award nomination as a co- writer of Lawrence of Arabia and credited as the winner of the Writers' Guild of Great Britain Award for Best British Dramatic Screenplay. Wilson also completed an unproduced screenplay on December 16, 1976, The Raid On Harper's Ferry, which was an adaptation of Truman J. Nelson's book The Old Man: John Brown at Harper's Ferry (1973). He also apparently wrote unproduced scripts for a movie about the Industrial Workers of the World titled The Wobblies and a movie about the infiltration of the Black Liberation Movement titled Quiet Darkness. Personal life Michael Wilson married Zelma Gussin in 1941; the couple had two daughters.\\"Here and There,\\" Berkeley Daily Gazette (June 23, 1941): 3, social page mentions the couple's recent wedding. Zelma's sister, Sylvia, was married to another blacklisted screenwriter, Paul Jarrico. Michael Wilson died of a heart attack in 1978 in Los Angeles County, California.

Background Before the Act was passed, citizens of Commonwealth countries had extensive rights to migrate to the UK. For instance, in the sparsely populated frontier area of San Tin in Hong Kong, 85‚Äì90 percent of the able-bodied males left for the United Kingdom between 1955 and 1962 to work in British factories, foundries, railways, buses, hotels, and restaurants. There was widespread opposition to immigration in Britain from a variety of political groups, including the Conservative Monday Club, whose Members of Parliament were very active and vocal in their opposition to mass immigration. In response to a perceived heavy influx of immigrants, the Conservative Party government tightened the regulations, permitting only those with government-issued employment vouchers, limited in number, to settle. The leader of the opposition in Parliament at the time, Hugh Gaitskell of the Labour Party, called the act \\"cruel and brutal anti- colour legislation\\". The Act The Act specified that all Commonwealth citizens, including citizens of the UK and Colonies (CUKCs), without a relevant connection to the UK were subject to immigration control. Commonwealth citizens who were born in the UK or who held a passport issued by the UK government in the UK or Ireland, CUKCs holding a passport issued by the UK Government (not including colonial governments) anywhere, and family members included in their passports were immune from control. Exemptions applied to Commonwealth citizens who were ordinarily resident in the UK at any point from 1960 to 1962, as well as wives and children under 16 accompanying a family member resident in the UK. The Act went into effect on 1 July 1962. Aftermath The Act was amended by the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968 and was superseded by another new Act, Immigration Act 1971, which came into force in 1971.

It uses Boehm garbage collector and GNU Classpath. The Jupiter Virtual Machine main aspects of its design can be simplified as: *Memory locality - Objects are allocated on the heap with little or no consideration for locality. While this approach may be appropriate for uniprocessors or small-scale SMPs, it is unlikely to work well on a cluster of workstations where remote memory access is one or two orders of magnitude slower than local memory access. *Parallel garbage collection - Garbage collection can consume a considerable amount of application time. Typically, JVMs employ \\"stop-the-world\\" garbage collectors, where program threads are halted during garbage collection. This approach will not work for large numbers of processors, for two reasons. First, the cost of \\"stopping the world\\" is considerably higher when the number of processors is large. Second, using a single thread to collect garbage results in an unacceptably large sequential fraction for any application. *Memory consistency model - To achieve scaling performance on many processors, it is important to exploit the \\"relaxed\\" Java Memory Model. Presently no JVM implements the JMM faithfully, and indeed many implement it incorrectly, leading to lack of coherence and loss of optimization opportunities. The specification of the JMM was also revised in 2007. *Efficient threads and synchronization - With many processors, it is critical to provide efficient threading support and synchronization mechanisms that scale well.

Numerous visual artists contributed to the building: architects created the unusual double-dome wooden structure over a curving concrete base, stained glass windows added color into the space, painters decorated the ceiling with motifs depicting the whole of human evolution, and sculptors carved huge column bases, capitals, and architraves with images of metamorphoses. Already during the construction, musicians, actors, and movement artists began performing a wide variety of pieces in a neighboring workshop. When the Goetheanum hall was completed, in 1919, these performances moved onto the stage located under the Goetheanum's smaller cupola. The auditorium was located under the larger cupola.

It represents a pioneering use of visible concrete in architecture and has been granted protected status as a Swiss national monument.Hans Hasler, \\"A sculptural expression of harmony\\", Architects' Journal , S9(3), March 4, 1999. Art critic Michael Brennan has called the building a \\"true masterpiece of 20th-century expressionist architecture\\".Michael Brennan, Rudolf Steiner, artnet Magazine 3/18/98 The present Goetheanum houses a 1000-seat auditorium, now the center of an active artistic community incorporating performances of its in-house theater and eurythmy troupes as well as visiting performers from around the world. Full remodelings of the central auditorium took place in the mid-1950s and again in the late 1990s. The stained glass windows in the present building date from Steiner's time; the painted ceiling and sculptural columns are contemporary replications or reinterpretations of those in the First Goetheanum. In a dedicated gallery, the building also houses a nine-meter-high wooden sculpture, The Representative of Humanity, by Edith Maryon and Rudolf Steiner.Paull, John (2018) A Portrait of Edith Maryon: Artist and Anthroposophist, Journal of Fine Arts, 1(2):8-15. Architectural principles Steiner's architecture is characterized by a liberation from traditional architectural constraints, especially through the departure from the right- angle as a basis for the building plan. For the first Goetheanum he achieved this in wood by employing boat builders to construct its rounded forms; for the second Goetheanum by using concrete to achieve sculptural shapes on an architectural scale.Richard Reid, The book of buildings: Ancient, medieval, Renaissance & modern architecture of North America & Europe, . Chapter title \\"Modern Architecture\\", subsection \\"Switzerland\\". The use of concrete to achieve organically expressive forms was an innovation for the times; in both buildings, Steiner sought to create forms that were spiritually expressive. Steiner suggested that he had derived the sculptural forms of the first Goetheanum from spiritual inspirations.Rudolf Steiner, Ways to a New Style in Architecture, five lectures given at Dornach, Switzerland during the building of the First Goetheanum, 1914.

Appel (1998), Modern Compiler Implementation in C - \\"Boehm Conservative Garbage Collector\\" Boehm GC is free software distributed under a permissive free software licence similar to the X11 license.  Design  Hans Boehm describes the operation of the collector as follows: Boehm GC can also run in leak detection modeUsing the Garbage Collector as Leak Detector in which memory management is still done manually, but the Boehm GC can check if it is done properly. In this way a programmer can find memory leaks and double deallocations. Boehm GC is also distributed with a C string handling library called cords. This is similar to ropes in C++ (trees of constant small arrays), but instead of using reference counting for proper deallocation, it relies on garbage collection to free objects. Cords are good at handling very large texts, modifications to them in the middle, slicing, concatenating, and keeping history of changes (undo/redo functionality).  Operation  The garbage collector works with most unmodified C programs, simply by replacing with calls, replacing with calls, and removing calls. The code piece below shows how one can use Boehm instead of traditional malloc and free in C.Using the Garbage Collector: A simple example #include #include #include int main(void) { int i; const size = 10000000; GC_INIT(); for (i = 0; i < size; ++i) { int **p = GC_MALLOC(sizeof *p); int *q = GC_MALLOC_ATOMIC(sizeof *q); assert(*p  0); *p = GC_REALLOC(q, 2 * sizeof *p); if (i  size-1) printf(\\"Heap size = %zu \\", GC_get_heap_size()); } return 0; } For completeness, boehm supports explicit deallocation via . All the substitution can be done using preprocessor macros.  Uses and ports  The Boehm GC is used by many projects that are implemented in C or C++ like Inkscape, as well as by runtime environments for a number of other languages, including Crystal, the GNU Compiler for Java runtime environment, the Portable.NET project, Embeddable Common Lisp, GNU Guile, the Mono implementation of the Microsoft .NET platform (also using precise compacting GC since version 2.8), GNUstep optionally, and libgc-dlibgc-d (a binding to libgc for the D programming language, used primarily in the MCI). It supports numerous operating systems, including many Unix variants (such as macOS) and Microsoft Windows, and provides a number of advanced features including incremental collection, parallel collection and a variety of finalizer semantics.

Biography Mapy Cort√©s began experimenting as an actress since an early age, working in Puerto Rican amateur theater. In 1932 Mapy traveled to New York City and married childhood friend Fernando \\"Papi\\" Cort√©s. Under contract to a theatrical troupe headlined by Dominican baritone Eduardo Brito, the couple traveled to Spain. After the company disbanded, the couple began performing in different teatro de revista companies, primarily in Barcelona. Mapy Cort√©s made her film debut as one of the two female leads in the comedy Dos Mujeres y un Don Juan (Two Women and a Don Juan, 1933). By that time Cort√©s had a nephew, Paquito Cordero, who would become a famed actor and producer in Puerto Rico. Mapy in the 1942 RKO film \\"Seven Days Leave.\\" After the start of the Spanish Civil War, Mapy and Fernando Cort√©s went to Marseilles before making their way down to Argentina. Following stops in Buenos Aires and Havana, where they appeared on stage and movies, the couple traveled to Mexico City. They made their stage debut as part of the Cantinflas revue and soon joined the growing Mexican film industry, which lacked established female stars. Back-to-back starring roles in three hit films - the Pan-American musical La liga de las canciones / The League of Songs (Chano Urueta, 1941), the nostalgia musical comedy ¬°Ay, qu√© tiempos, se√±or don Sim√≥n! / Oh, What Times, Don Simon! (Julio Bracho, 1941) and the Cantinflas comedy El gendarme desconocido / The Unknown Policeman (Miguel M. Delgado, 1941) - quickly turned Mapy Cort√©s into one of the most bankable leading ladies in Mexican cinema. In 1942, Cort√©s made her only foray into Hollywood cinema, playing a singer in the RKO wartime musical comedy Seven Days' Leave. Her eponymous character is engaged to Victor Mature's soldier character before he falls in love with a socialite played by Lucille Ball. During this period Mapy also appeared in the U.S. State Department propaganda short film Mexican Moods, made soon after Mexico joined the United Nations. The short shows Mapy and Fernando performing at the Roosevelt Hotel in Mexico City. Mapy sings the Rafael Hern√°ndez song \\"Nada\\" (Nothing), which the couple later performed in the 1966 film Luna de miel en Puerto Rico as part of a tribute to the recently deceased composer. After filming Seven Days Leave, Mapy Cort√©s returned to Mexico City and played top-billed roles in contemporary romantic comedies and nostalgia musicals set during the Mexican Belle √âpoque. The 1945 Mapy Cort√©s vehicle La p√≠cara Susana / Mischievous Susana marked the directorial debut of her husband Fernando, who remained very active as a comedy director in Mexican film and TV until his death in 1979, directing vehicles for popular Mexican comedians like Tin-Tan, Resortes, and la India Maria. While Fernando's demand as journeyman comedy director grew, Mapy's film career waned in the early 1950s with the rise of a younger generation of vedettes, rumberas and musical comedy stars. The couple received an invitation from √Ångel Ramos, owner of El Mundo Enterprises, to help launch WKAQ-TV Telemundo Channel 2. On March 28, 1954, Puerto Rico received its first television transmission from Telemundo: a live broadcast of the Spanish comedy El caso de la mujer asesinadita, starring Mapy and directed by Fernando. The couple also starred in the station's first comedy show Mapy y Papi, an adaptation of the I Love Lucy format that also featured Maria Judith Franco and Mapy's nephew Paquito Cordero. Despite their success in Puerto Rican television, the couple decided to return to Mexico City, where they starred in a Mexican version of Mapy y Papi. Her niece Mapita Cort√©s had been living with the couple in Mexico City and she briefly joined the Mexican film industry after becoming Miss Puerto Rico 1957. After an eight-year absence from films, Mapy Cort√©s co-starred in the comedy Dormitorio para se√±oritas / Girls' Dormitory (1959), a loose remake of her 1943 hit Internado para se√±oritas / Girls' Dormitory (1943), starring Mapita and directed by Fernando. However, Mapita quickly retired from showbiz after marrying the popular Chilean crooner Lucho Gatica and only briefly returned many years later, as part of the Mexican telenovela industry. By the 1960s, Mapy Cort√©s was working mostly on the Mexico City stage, often starring in comedies by Spanish author Alfonso Paso. Her last film appearances were supporting roles in three Puerto Rican/Mexican co-productions that were filmed in Puerto Rico, directed by her husband, and produced by her nephew Paquito. After Fernando Cort√©s died, Mapy Cort√©s returned to Puerto Rico and led a relatively quiet life. In 1998 she died at her home of a heart attack. She was buried at the Puerto Rico Memorial Cemetery in Carolina, Puerto Rico.

History 44444 shunting just south of the station in 1950 The Manchester and Birmingham Railway opened in stages from Manchester and reached Stockport in 1840. The line ran from a temporary station in Manchester to another in Stockport at the north end of the uncompleted Stockport Viaduct. The temporary station which was later renamed Heaton Norris was Stockport's only station for more than two years. After the viaduct was completed, the M&BR; built a station at its southern end as an experiment. The decision was prompted by complaints that the first station was a long way from the industrial parts of town and even farther from the residential districts on the south side. The second station opened on 15 February 1843 as Edgeley. By 1844, it was the town's principal station. Heaton Norris, at the north end of the viaduct, closed in 1959. The station was operated by the London and North Western Railway and became part of the London Midland and Scottish Railway in 1923. In 1948, British Railways ran the system. Lines into the station were electrified at 25 kV AC, using overhead wires, under the British Railways 1955 Modernisation Plan. BR Class 101 under Regional Railways calling at the station in 1993. However, not all the local lines were electrified. Facilities Main entrance The station is positioned at high level above the valley of the River Mersey and with lifts that link a pedestrian underpass to central Stockport and Edgeley. The station is staffed, has a ticket office and ticket machines, customer service points, shops, toilets, waiting rooms, lifts from the station subway and step-free access to the platforms.National Rail Enquiries - Station facilities for Stockport Accessed 2014-06-03Stockport Station Plan Accessed 2014-06-03 In 2009, the station was identified as one of the ten worst category B interchange stations for mystery shopper assessment of fabric and environment and received a share of ¬£50m funding for improvements. Metrolink plans A Metrolink extension was proposed in 2004 but dropped on cost grounds. In 2016, it was announced that the plans were revived to extend the line to Stockport. The line will terminate at the railway station. =History= An extension to the line, from East Didsbury to Stockport, was planned in 2004 and GMPTE applied for powers to build it. The project came to a halt when the big bang extension was stopped. The proposed extension would have reused some of the former railway alignment but some of it was built on or filled in after closure. This made re-opening more difficult and the proposed line would have included new infrastructure and street running sections to take it into Stockport. The line would have terminated at Stockport bus station.

He is best known for playing The Demon Headmaster in the children's television series of the same name, and also for portraying Luftwaffe Police Major Reinhardt in the 1970s drama series Secret Army. Career Born in Forest Gate, Newham, London, Hardiman was educated at Buckhurst Hill County High School, Essex, and at Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge (then known as Fitzwilliam House), where he read English.'Cambridge University Tripos Results: English', Times, 25 June 1959, p. 15. He is often seen playing authority figures, and has played Nazi era German military personnel (Secret Army, Colditz, Wish Me Luck and Enemy at the Door) and British officers (When the Boat Comes In), police inspectors (Juliet Bravo and Softly, Softly), doctors (Home to Roost, The Royal), barristers (Crown Court and The Brittas Empire), judges (The Bill and The Courtroom), Father Abbot Radulfus (Cadfael), and an evil headmaster (The Demon Headmaster). He also played Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald, in Richard Attenborough's Gandhi. Hardiman's television work has included him playing barrister Stephen Harvesty in Granada Television's Crown Court from 1972 to 1983. Hardiman's portrayal of Major Reinhardt, in Secret Army, the (fictional) head of the Luftwaffe (German Air force) police, often provided a foil to Clifford Rose's more brutal S.S. Chief, Kessler. As with many of the characters in Secret Army, Reinhardt was not a one dimensional villain, but a rounded character who often questioned his own motives and methods. The actor's portrayal allowed the viewer to sympathise with this character. In 1990, he played a two dimensional German officer, General Stuckler, in the final series of London Weekend Television's Wish Me Luck. Hardiman starred as the eponymous The Demon Headmaster in the children's television drama series, which ran to three series from 1996 to 1998, and proved popular with adults as well as children. He reprised his role as a cameo in the 2019 reboot . He also had a starring role as Charles Pooter in the 1979 television adaptation of George and Weedon Grossmith's Diary of a Nobody, a role which shows his versatility more than the succession of officers he usually portrays. Hardiman's other recurring role was as Brother Cadfael's ecclesiastical superior, Abbot Radulfus, in the television series. Joining him throughout the series as Prior Robert was Michael Culver, who had played his predecessor Major Brandt in Secret Army. A notable small role Hardiman played was a version of the Sergeant Wilson character from Dad's Army, in an episode of time travel comedy Goodnight Sweetheart, called \\"Don't Get Around Much Any More\\", in which Nicholas Lyndhurst's character Gary Sparrow goes back in time to a bank in the 1940s, and encounters characters called Mainwaring and Wilson. Hardiman's portrayal was a keenly observed impersonation of John Le Mesurier's own performance, incorporating many of the tics and mannerisms of the original. Hardiman also appeared as Grand Wizard Egbert Hellibore in four episodes of The Worst Witch. Hardiman appeared in the second series of The Worst Week of My Life. Another notable recent role was as a devious Swiss murder victim in an episode of crime mystery series Jonathan Creek. He made an appearance on the daily soap on BBC One, Doctors, on 3 April 2009, as well as from 14 to 15 January 2015, and in the drama from Yorkshire, Heartbeat, as John Upton in one episode. In 2009, he appeared in a film for the BFI, Radio Mania: An Abandoned Work, directed by British artists Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard. The film was based on The Man from M.A.R.S. (1922). Hardiman appeared as Hawthorne in the episode of Doctor Who, \\"The Beast Below\\", on 10 April 2010.

Biography =Early years= Paul Jarrico was born in Los Angeles, California on January 12, 1915, as Israel Shapiro. His father was a Russian Jewish immigrant, a lawyer, poet and socialist. While attending UCLA, Jarrico joined the Young Communist League, where he became an active member of the American Communist Party. His alliance and association with the party lasted from 1937 to 1952. Jarrico married Sylvia Gussin in 1936. Sylvia's younger sister, Zelma, married screenwriter Michael Wilson in 1941. =Film career= During the 1930s, Jarrico began his writing career. He mostly wrote crime and comedy scripts for lower budget Hollywood films with Columbia Pictures. Among these films were No Time to Marry (1937), I Am the Law (1938), and Beauty for the Asking (1939), starring Lucille Ball. In the early 1940s, Jarrico was sent to Northern Africa and Italy to be a merchant marine in World War II. When he returned home he restarted his career with Metro Goldwyn Mayer Pictures. His 1941 film Tom, Dick and Harry, starring Ginger Rogers, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. In 1943, Jarrico co-scripted the feature film Song of Russia. The film was created under pressure from president Franklin D. Roosevelt to garner sympathy from the public for the Soviet cause in their war against Germany. Some other successful films written by Jarrico in the 1940s include Thousands Cheer (1943), The Search (1948) and Not Wanted (1949). =Blacklisted= Jarrico had engaged in a protracted legal battle with Howard Hughes, the head of RKO. In 1950, while working on his newest script for the Howard Hughes film, The White Tower, a friend close to Jarrico gave his name to the House Un-American Activities Committee. Immediately upon hearing the news of Jarrico's subpoena, Hughes dismissed Jarrico from the film. After refusing to testify before HUAC, Jarrico was blacklisted and his passport was confiscated. This made it extremely difficult for him to make films. No American studios were willing to make his scripts into movies, and he could not go to other countries due to his lack of a passport. In 1954, Jarrico went to New Mexico with Herbert J. Biberman, a fellow blacklist filmmaker, where they created the film Salt of the Earth. The film was the only one to be made by blacklisted filmmakers, and therefore became blacklisted itself, making it the only blacklisted film. The film was one of 100 films chosen by the Library of Congress for the National Film Registry in 1992. In 1958, he moved to Europe where he lived for over twenty years. During the 1960s he used the pseudonym Peter Achilles to co-script several films, including Jovanka e l‚ÄôAltri (1960), Call Me Bwana (1963), Der Schatz der Azteken (1965) and La Balada de Johnny Ringo (1966). He also wrote scripts for television in Europe all throughout the 1960s. =Personal life and death = In 1966 Jarrico divorced Sylvia Gussin, his wife of 30 years, to marry a Frenchwoman, Yvette Le Floc'h, from whom he separated in 1977. He then returned to the United States where he met and, in 1992, married Lia Benedetti. He spent the rest of his life in California. He taught courses at the University of California at Santa Barbara and lectured on film theory and the blacklist in the U.S. and Europe. Jarrico died on October 28, 1997, in a car accident. He was returning home after attending events commemorating the beginnings of the blacklist fifty years earlier. He was 82 years old.

Recording a total of five albums, The last two - Radio Ixtlan (2004) and Conspiritus (2005) - were released through the UK's Earache Records. The track \\"Its Not Reality\\" was featured on a PlayStation 2 video game called Extreme Metal Racing, as well as being remixed by Hardcore Techno producer Scott Brown. In 2007, Ewigkeit was ended (as reported by Blabbermouth), and following, Fogarty founded a new project called The Bombs of Enduring Freedom. The Bombs of Enduring Freedom Formed in 2007, the music of 'The Bombs Of Enduring Freedom' is a mix of industrial metal and modern electronic music. The self-titled debut album was featured in a two-page article in the UK's Metal Hammer magazine. Further EPs have been released. In 2008, The Bombs Of Enduring Freedom remixed the track \\"Survival of the Outlaw\\" for Norwegian black metal band Solefald for their remix album The Circular Drain. In 2011, a video was made for a track called \\"Bin Laden Is Dead\\" by Matthias Fritsch (the filmmaker behind Techno Viking). As well as limited-edition CD releases, all material is available to download free from the band's website.  Jaldaboath / The Meads of Asphodel  In 1998, Fogarty co-founded the experimental black metal band The Meads Of Asphodel under the pseudonym of Jaldaboath, for whom he wrote and recorded the band's demos, the debut album The Excommunication of Christ and the \\"Jihad\\" EP (a split EP with Norwegian black metal band Mayhem which gained 'Single of the Week' in Kerrang! magazine). In 2003, Fogarty left the project to concentrate fully on Ewigkeit. In 2008, Fogarty formed a new project called 'Jaldaboath' - the music is comical in nature, taking inspiration from Monty Python, Black Adder and various subgenres of heavy metal. Austria's Napalm Records released the debut full-length album The Rise of the Heraldic Beasts worldwide in September 2010. The CD was also released via Death To Music productions as a limited edition. Jaldaboath  Death To Music productions  Fogarty founded 'Death To Music', a Netlabel with occasional limited edition releases. The majority of the releases are MP3 downloads.

Its population is approximately 6,500. Characteristics It is an administrative and cultural centre of the Laborec Region. A train line connects it with the town of Humenn√© to the south and with Poland to the north. The private sector and service industries are developing quickly in the town at the moment. It is home to the Andy Warhol Museum of Modern Art, opened in 1991, which contains many artworks and effects of Andy Warhol and of his brother Paul and nephew James Warhola. Warhol's mother, Julia Warhola, was born and lived with her husband in the village of Mikov√°, to the west. Medzilaborce is situated in one of the least developed regions of Slovakia. There are three churches in the town. Geography City parts: * Medzilaborce * Borov * Vydra≈à The town of Medzilaborce lies in the valley of the Laborec river in north-eastern Slovakia. The hills of the surrounding Laborec Highlands are typical of this countryside. History The oldest written record connected with Medzilaborce dates back to 1543. The village first belonged to the Drugeth family, but passed to the Cs√°ky family in the 17th century and later in the 19th century to the Andrassy family manor. As early as the 17th century, an important trade route passed through Medzilaborce connecting the interior of Slovakia with Poland through the Lupkov Pass. Medzilaborce became a town in 1860. (Slovak) In 1873, construction of the train track between Humenn√© and Medzilaborce and further on to Galicia via the Lupkov Pass, which contributed to the growth of the town from 724 inhabitants in 1851 to 1561 citizens in 1910. During World War I, Russian troops entered the town in February 1915 and stayed there until May 1915, leaving the town significantly damaged. During the first Czechoslovak republic, there was massive unemployment, and many people emigrated from the town. The town was significantly damaged again during World War II. It was the seat of the district until 1960, when it was merged with the Humenn√© district. It has again been the seat of the Medzilaborce district since 1996.

This wide tie is usually patterned, folded over, and fastened with a tie pin or tie clip. It is usually reserved for formal wear with morning dress for daytime weddings and worn with a cutaway morning coat and striped grey formal trousers. This type of dress cravat is made of a thicker, woven type of silk similar to a modern tie and is traditionally either grey or black. The ascot is descended from the earlier type of cravat widespread in the early 19th century, most notably during the age of Beau Brummell, made of heavily starched linen and elaborately tied around the neck. Later in the 1880s, amongst the upper-middle-class in Europe men began to wear a more loosely tied version for formal daytime events with daytime full dress in frock coats or with morning coats. It remains a feature of morning dress for weddings today. The Royal Ascot race meeting at the Ascot Racecourse gave the ascot its name, although such dress cravats were no longer worn with morning dress at the Royal Ascot races by the Edwardian era. The ascot was still commonly worn for business with morning dress in the late 19th and very early 20th centuries. In British English, the casual form is called a cravat, or sometimes as a day cravat to distinguish it from the highly formal dress cravat. It is made from a thinner woven silk that is more comfortable when worn against the skin, often with ornate and colourful printed patterns.

In the Dutch Army, it is a part of the uniform, for barrack use, the ascot is often in the weapon colors, and with a logo, and when in combat uniform, a DPM or desert version is used. Likewise the Royal Danish Army employs an ascot for the ceremonial version of the barrack dress, its colors vary between each company.

The term midnight movie is rooted in the practice that emerged in the 1950s of local television stations around the United States airing low-budget genre films as late-night programming, often with a host delivering ironic asides. As a cinematic phenomenon, the midnight screening of offbeat movies began in the early 1970s in a few urban centers, particularly in New York City with screenings of El Topo at the Elgin Theater, eventually spreading across the country. The screening of non-mainstream pictures at midnight was aimed at building a cult film audience, encouraging repeat viewing and social interaction in what was originally a countercultural setting. The national success of The Rocky Horror Picture Show and the changing economics of the film exhibition industry altered the nature of the midnight movie phenomenon; as its association with broader trends of cultural and political opposition dwindled in the 1980s, the midnight movie became a more purely camp experience‚Äîin effect, bringing it closer to the television form that shares its name. The term midnight movie is now often used in two different, though related, ways: as a synonym for B movie, reflecting the relative cheapness characteristic of late-night movies both theatrically and on TV, and as a synonym for cult film.See, e.g., Conrich (2006). History =On television= In 1953, the Screen Actors Guild agreed to a residuals payment plan that greatly facilitated the distribution of B movies to television.Heffernan (2004), p. 161. A number of local television stations around the United States soon began showing inexpensive genre films in late- night slots; these late-night slots were after the safe-harbor time, meaning they were largely exempt from Federal Communications Commission regulations on indecent content. In the spring of 1954, Los Angeles TV station KABC expanded on the concept by having an appropriately offbeat host introduce the films: for a year on Saturday nights, The Vampira Show, with Maila Nurmi in her newly adopted persona of a sexy bloodsucker (\\"Your pin-down girl\\"), presented low- budget movies with black humor and a low-cut black dress. The show‚Äîwhich ran at midnight for four weeks before shifting to 11 p.m. and, later, 10:30‚Äîaired horror pictures like Devil Bat's Daughter and Strangler of the Swamp and suspense films such as Murder by Invitation, The Charge Is Murder, and Apology for Murder.The Vampira Show . Retrieved 11/14/06. The format was echoed by stations across the country, who began showing their late-night B movies with in-character hosts such as Zacherley and Morgus the Magnificent offering ironic interjections. A quarter-century later, Cassandra Peterson established a persona that was essentially a ditzier, more buxom version of Vampira. As Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, Peterson became the most popular host in the arena of the TV midnight movie. Starting at L.A.'s KHJ-TV in 1981, Elvira's Movie Macabre was soon being syndicated nationally; Peterson presented mostly cut-rate horror films, interrupted on a regular basis for tongue-in-cheek commentary.See Gibron (2006) for a detailed analysis of the Elvira persona and Movie Macabre. Some local stations aired the Movie Macabre package in late- night slots. Others showed it during prime time on weekend nights; after a break for the local news, another genre film‚Äîa literal midnight movie‚Äîmight follow, resulting in such virtual double bills as Dr. Heckyl & Mr. Hype and The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave.See, e.g., Elvira's Movie Macabre . Retrieved 11/14/06. USA Network launched a midnight movie package in 1989‚ÄîUp All Night, which showed mainly horror and soft-core sexploitation films, ran until 1998. In 1993, Buffalo's WKBW-TV began airing a late-night hosted mix of low-budget genre movies, foreign art films and eventually well-known classic films; Off Beat Cinema later became nationally syndicated (currently through Retro Television Network) and, as of 2013, originates from WBBZ-TV. In the 2000s, horror-oriented late-night movie programming has disappeared from many broadcast stations, though B pictures, mostly of a melodramatic nature, are still widely used in post‚Äìprime time slots. The small America One broadcast network distributes the Macabre Theatre movie package hosted by Butch Patrick, known for his portrayal of Eddie Munster on the 1960s show The Munsters. In 2006, Turner Classic Movies began airing cult films as part of its new late- night series, TCM Underground.See TCM Underground: Films‚ÄîArchive . Retrieved 12/19/06. In the United Kingdom, the BBC launched a regular late night movie slot on Saturday nights on BBC Two. From Saturday August 20, 1966, BBC Two started to air a \\"Midnight Movie\\" every Saturday night on the channel. The first \\"Midnight Movie\\" was \\"Blind Date\\" starring Hardy Kr√ºger. The Midnight Movie would air every Saturday night on BBC Two, and would continue through the 1970s. The Midnight Movie was an attempt by the BBC to provide a late night alternative, when the two other channels BBC One and ITV would normally end their Saturday programming at around 12-midnight. This was partly due to the restrictions imposed on the broadcasting hours of both BBC and ITV by the British government, normally no more than 8 hours in a given day. As BBC Two did not broadcast a large amount of daytime programming, they had plenty of hours to spare to remain on the air late into the night, especially on a Saturday, thus the creation of the \\"Midnight Movie\\" strand was started. Most of the films aired were at least a decade old, but from 1967 nearly all of the films broadcast were made in color, as BBC Two became the first UK channel in 1967 to transmit color television. It is also noted however, that the \\"Midnight Movie\\" never actually started at Midnight. The movie was designed to air \\"through\\" the midnight hour, and could start as early as 11.15pm. By 1983 the \\"Midnight Movie\\" strand was abandoned by BBC Two, with BBC One airing a late night movie on a Friday night instead, usually a horror film. The \\"Midnight Movie\\" slot on BBC Two would be replaced with late night sporting coverage or different genre of films on occasions, which would not use the \\"Midnight Movie\\" strand. =In the cinema= Since at least as far back as the 1930s, exploitation films had sometimes been presented at midnight screenings, usually as part of independent roadshow operations.Schaefer (1999), pp. 124‚Äì125. In 1957, Hammer Films' The Curse of Frankenstein set off a spate of midnight presentations.Heffernan (2004), p. 61. What film qualifies as the first true midnight movie in the sense of the term that emerged in the 1970s remains an open question. Critic Jennifer M. Wood points to the Palace Theater in San Francisco's North Beach district where, in 1968, San Francisco Art Institute graduates Steven Arnold and Michael Wiese, after a sellout screening of their Dal√≠-esque thesis film Messages, Messages, were invited to program offbeat films at midnight.Wood (2004). Author Gary Lachman claims that Kenneth Anger's short Invocation of My Demon Brother (1969), a m√©lange of occult symbology intercut with and superimposed on images from a Rolling Stones concert, \\"inaugurat[ed] the midnight movie cult at the Elgin Theatre.\\"Lachman (2001), p. 305. The Elgin, in New York City's Chelsea neighborhood, would soon become famous as a midnight venue when it gave the U.S. premiere of a very unusual Mexican movie directed and written by a rather Dal√≠-esque Chilean. The movie generally recognized as igniting the theatrical midnight film movement is Alejandro Jodorowsky's surrealist El Topo, which opened in December 1970 at the Elgin. Playing with the conventions of the spaghetti Western, the film was described by one newspaper critic as \\"full of tests and riddles\\" and \\"more phony gore than maybe 20 years of The Wild Bunch.\\"Greenspun (1971). El Topo regularly sold out every night for months, with many fans returning on a weekly basis. It ran at the theater through June 1971, until at the prompting of John Lennon‚Äîwho was reported to have seen the film at least three times‚ÄîBeatles manager Allen Klein purchased the film through his ABKCO film company and gave it a relatively orthodox rerelease.Hoberman and Rosenbaum (1983), pp. 80, 95. For a detailed synopsis of the film, see El Topo (note the film's Elgin premiere is misdated). The Elgin soon came up with another midnight hit in Peter Bogdanovich's spree-killer thriller Targets (1968), featuring one of the last performances by horror movie mainstay Boris Karloff and a tale that resonated with the assassinations and other political violence of recent years.The 15 Best Midnight Movies of All Time - Taste of Cinema By November 1971, four Manhattan theaters beside the Elgin were featuring regularly scheduled midnight movies: the St. Marks (Viva la muerte, a blast of surrealism in the Franco-Spanish tradition of Luis Bu√±uel and another Lennon favorite), the Waverly (Equinox, which had just replaced Night of the Living Dead), the Bijou (both Freaks and Night of the Living Dead), and the Olympia (Macuna√≠ma, a Brazilian political black comedy).Hoberman and Rosenbaum (1983), p. 95. Equinox (1970) and Night of the Living Dead (1968), both low-budget horror pictures, demonstrate the ties between the old, TV brand of midnight movie and the newer phenomenon. George A. Romero's zombie masterpiece, in particular, highlighted one of the differences: produced completely outside of New York and/or Los Angeles as Romero was making industrial films in Pittsburgh at the time.Night of the Living Dead: Mere Anarchy Is LoosedThe CurrentThe Criterion Collection Shot over the winter of 1971‚Äì72, John Waters's \\"filth epic\\" Pink Flamingos, featuring incest and coprophagia, became the best known of a group of campy midnight films focusing on sexual perversions and fetishism.Waters (2006). Filmed on weekends in Waters's hometown of Baltimore, with a mile-long extension cord as a power conduit, it was also crucial in inspiring the growth of the independent film movement.Pink Flamingos Production Notes. Retrieved 11/15/06. In 1973, the Elgin Theater started midnight screenings of both Pink Flamingos and a crime drama from Jamaica with a remarkable soundtrack. In its mainstream release, The Harder They Come (1972) had been a flop, panned by critics after its U.S. distributor, Roger Corman's New World Pictures, marketed it as a blaxploitation picture. Rereleased as a midnight film, it screened around the country for six years, helping spur the popularity of reggae in the United States. While the midnight-movie potential of certain films was recognized only some time after they opened, a number during this period were distributed to take advantage of the market from the beginning‚Äîin 1973, for instance, Broken Goddess, Dragula, The White Whore and the Bit Player, and Elevator Girls in Bondage (as well as Pink Flamingos) had their New York premieres at midnight screenings.Hoberman and Rosenbaum (1983), p. 13. Another example (albeit animated) during this time was Ralph Bakshi's 1972 debut feature Fritz the Cat based on the Robert Crumb comic of the same name.The 50 Greatest Midnight Movies of All Time - Flavorwire Around this time, the black comedy Harold and Maude (1971) became the first major Hollywood studio movie of the era to develop a substantial cult audience of repeat viewers; though apparently it was not picked up by much of the midnight movie circuit during the 1970s, it subsequently became a late show staple as the phenomenon turned more to camp revivals.See Hoberman and Rosenbaum (1983), p. 298. The midnight screening phenomenon was spreading around the country. In Milwaukee, it began in May 1974, spurred by the sales manager of a local radio station who had already successfully sponsored such screenings in St. Louis. By the following February, four Milwaukee theaters were regularly showing midnight films, and the Marcus chain, the owner of one, had brought the concept to its theaters in four other Midwestern cities. \\"Films that feature rock concerts draw big\\", Boxoffice reported, \\"as do those dealing with outer space and fantasy\\". The trade paper noted one popular midnight film by name: Alice's Restaurant (1969), a comedy with political overtones starring folk singer Arlo Guthrie.\\"Midnight Shows a Big Success in Milwaukee.\\" Boxoffice Feb. 3, 1975, p. NC-3 Liquid Sky (1982)The 50 Greatest Midnight Movies of All Time - Flavorwire was one of the last independent films to become a midnight hit during the movement's most influential years.

On the midnight following April Fool's Day 1976, The Rocky Horror Picture Show, which had flopped on initial release the year before, opened at the Waverly Theater, a leading midnight movie venue in New York's Greenwich Village. Midnight screenings of the film soon became a national sensation, amassing a cult following all over the United States. Every Friday and Saturday night, audience members would talk back to the screen, dress up as characters in the film, and act out scenes complete with props.See History of the Rocky Horror Picture Show and Rocky Horror Timeline. Retrieved 11/14/06. Where the social aspect had always been a part of the midnight movie's attraction, with Rocky Horror in an exaggerated way it became the attraction. By summer 1979, the film was playing on weekend midnights in twenty-odd suburban theaters in the New York region alone; 20th Century Fox had approximately two hundred prints of the movie in circulation for midnight shows around the country. Beginning in 1978, the Waverly developed another midnight success that was much smaller commercially, but more significant artistically: Eraserhead, originally distributed the previous year. A model of shoestring surrealism, David Lynch's feature debut (which played alongside Susan Pitt's animated short Asparagus)Fever Dreamer: Susan Pitt's Feminist FantasiesThe CurrentThe Criterion Collection reaffirmed the midnight movie's most central traditions. Decline The commercial viability of the sort of big-city arthouses that launched outsider pictures for the midnight movie circuit began to decrease in the late 1970s as broad social and economic shifts weakened their countercultural base. Leading midnight movie venues were beginning to fold as early as 1977‚Äîthat year, New York's Bijou switched back permanently to the live entertainment for which it had been built, and the Elgin, after a brief run with gay porn, shut down completely.Bijou Theatre; Elgin Theatre. Retrieved 11/15/06. In succeeding years, the popularization of the VCR and the expansion of movieviewing possibilities on cable television meant the death of many additional independent theaters. While Rocky Horror soldiered on, by then a phenomenon unto itself, and new films like The Warriors (1979),The 50 Greatest Midnight Movies of All Time - Flavorwire Altered States (1980),The 50 Greatest Midnight Movies of All Time - Flavorwire Forbidden Zone (1980, released 1982),Forbidden Zone - AV Club The Evil Dead (1981),The 50 Greatest Midnight Movies of All Time - Flavorwire Heavy Metal (1981),The 50 Greatest Midnight Movies of All Time - Flavorwire Pink Floyd ‚Äì The Wall (1982),The 15 Best Midnight Movies of All Time - Taste of Cinema and Repo Man (1984)The 50 Greatest Midnight Movies of All Time - Flavorwire and Akira (1988)The 50 Greatest Midnight Movies of All Time - Flavorwire‚Äîall from mainstream distributors‚Äîwere picked up by the midnight movie circuit, the core of exhibitors that energized the movement was disappearing. By the time the fabled Orson Welles Cinema in Cambridge, Massachusetts, shut its doors after a fire in 1986,Remembering the Orson Welles Cinema, 50 years later - The Boston Globe the days of the theatrical midnight movie as a significant countercultural phenomenon were already past. Legacy In 1988, the midnight movie experience was institutionalized in a new manner with the introduction of the Toronto International Film Festival's nightly Midnight Madness section.Corliss and Catto (2007). In the years since, new or recent films still occasionally emerge as midnight movie \\"hits\\" on the circuit of theaters that continue to show them. The most successful of the 1990s generation were the Oscar-winning Australian drag queen road saga The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert (1994) and the 1995 Razzie-winning stripper drama Showgirls.The 50 Greatest Midnight Movies of All Time - Flavorwire One of the theaters to show it regularly at midnight was New York's Waverly (also now closed), where Rocky Horror had played for a house record ninety-five weeks. A celebrated episode of television's The Drew Carey Show features a song-and- dance battle between Rocky Horror fans (led by Drew Carey) and Priscilla fans (led by Mimi Bobeck). Since the turn of the millennium, the most notable successes among newly minted midnight movies have been Donnie Darko (2001) and The Room (2003).The 15 Best Midnight Movies of All Time - Taste of Cinema Older films are also popular on the circuit, appreciated largely in an imposed camp fashion‚Äîa midnight movie tradition that goes back to the 1972 revival of the hectoring anti-drug movie Reefer Madness (1936).See Hoberman and Rosenbaum (1983), pp. 261‚Äì262. For their consideration of Freaks as part of the early midnight movie phenomenon, see pp. 3, 95, 99, 295‚Äì297. (Tod Browning's 1932 horror classic Freaks, the original midnight movie revival, is both too dark and too sociologically acute to readily consume as camp.) Where the irony with which Reefer Madness was adopted as a midnight favorite had its roots in a countercultural sensibility, in the latter's place there is now the parodoxical element of nostalgia: the leading revivals on the circuit currently include the cr√®me de la cr√®me of the John Hughes oeuvre‚ÄîThe Breakfast Club (1985), Pretty in Pink (1986), and Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986)‚Äîand the preteen adventure film The Goonies (1985).Beale (2005). As of late 2006, Rocky Horror itself continues to play on a weekly basis at thirty- two venues around the country, and at least once a month at about two dozen others.Rocky Horror Showings List. Retrieved 06/27/08. Two popular midnight movies made during the phenomenon's heyday have been selected to the National Film Registry: Eraserhead (inducted 2004) and The Rocky Horror Picture Show (inducted 2005). Midnight movie staples Freaks (1932) and Night of the Living Dead (1968) were inducted in 1994 and 1997 respectively.

Eisenhower, the United States General of the Army. Built for the London & North Eastern Railway in 1937, this locomotive was originally numbered 4496 and named Golden Shuttle. It was renamed Dwight D. Eisenhower after World War II and renumbered 8 on 23 November 1946, under Edward Thompson's LNER 1946 renumbering scheme. After nationalisation in 1948, British Railways renumbered it 60008 on 29 October 1948. It was retired from service in 1963 and was moved to the National Railroad Museum in Ashwaubenon, a suburb of Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States, where it is currently on display. It returned to England in 2012 for display at the National Railway Museum in York, when all surviving A4s were reunited. It returned to Green Bay in 2014. Liveries Like the other members of the A4 class, Dwight D. Eisenhower has carried numerous liveries during its career. When first introduced into traffic on 4 September 1937, locomotive 4496 was named Golden Shuttle and painted in LNER garter blue with stainless steel trim on the base of the valances and tender. The numbers and LNER lettering on the tender were also stainless steel. This livery design was also used on the A4s that were named after countries, on the Coronation service in order to match with the rolling stock. 4496's next livery was wartime black with 'LNER' on the tender, applied 30 January 1942. This livery was modified to read just 'NE' on the tender in a repaint on 12 March 1943. LNER garter blue was reapplied 25 September 1945 and the name Dwight D. Eisenhower applied, but the name was covered until February 1946. The next livery applied was British Railways dark blue livery with black and white lining on 14 June 1950. The final livery applied was British Railways Brunswick green, applied 9 November 1951. Dwight D. Eisenhower had a non-standard red background to the nameplate c. 1958. During its time allocated to Grantham motive power depot, the name of the depot was stencilled on the buffer beam. Technical details Like all the early A4 locomotives prior to Mallard, Golden Shuttle was released to service with a single chimney and side valances covering the wheels. The valances were removed to aid in maintenance during a general overhaul on 30 January 1942. Experimental Automatic Train Control equipment was fitted on 23 June 1950. A double chimney and Kylchap double blastpipe was installed to help performance, during an overhaul 20 August 1958. A Smith-Stone type speed indicator was installed 30 June 1960. Dwight D. Eisenhower has had eleven boilers during its career: 8959 (from new); 8945 (from 4482 Golden Eagle), 30 January 1942; 8906 (spare) from 23 November 1946; 8955 (from 60026 Miles Beevor), 14 June 1950; 29314 (new), 9 November 1951; 29303 (from 60030 Guillemot) 18 June 1954; 29296 (from 60033 Seagull), 8 July 1955; 29308 (from 60032 Golden Fleece), 20 December 1956; 29312 (from 60010 Dominion of Canada), 20 August 1958; 27964 (new), 30 June 1960 and finally 29335 (from 60019 Bittern), 17 May 1962. Dwight D. Eisenhower had two tenders during its career: 5651 from new and 5671 from 1 April 1957. Career Locomotive 4496 was to have been named Sparrow Hawk, but was instead named Golden Shuttle. Sparrow Hawk was later used on 4463. 25 September 1945 locomotive 4496 was ex-works and the next day was at Marylebone station for the directors of the LNER to view it. The nameplates were covered and it was intended that the Supreme Commander, Allied Forces would attend an official unveiling, but this could not be arranged. From new, Golden Shuttle was allocated to Doncaster shed for just nine days from 20‚Äì29 September 1937. It was transferred to Kings Cross Top Shed until 4 December 1939, when it was reallocated to Grantham. On 4 June 1950, Dwight D. Eisenhower was reallocated back to Top Shed. On 7 April 1957, it moved back to Grantham until it was sent back to 'Top Shed' on 15 September 1957. Its final depot allocation was New England shed in Peterborough from 16 June 1963. On 4 October 1962, Dwight D. Eisenhower hauled a special train from Stratford station in East London to York, after being specially cleaned by Kings Cross Top Shed staff. It was withdrawn from service on 20 July 1963. By this time, the Deltic diesel electric locomotives had displaced steam from premier services, so the A4 fleet was reduced and concentrated further north. Dwight D. Eisenhower was donated to the United States of America and sent to Doncaster Works for restoration. Preservation LNER/British Railways A4 No. 60008 Dwight D. Eisenhower on display at the National Railroad Museum on 26 April 2004 Earmarked for the National Railroad Museum in Ashwaubenon, a suburb of Green Bay, Wisconsin, the locomotive was cosmetically restored at Doncaster Works on 19 July 1963. The following spring, it was shipped to the US, arriving in New York Harbor on 11 May 1964.TRAINS Magazine September 1964 Shipped by rail, it arrived at the museum later that month. In October 1990, it was moved to Abilene, Kansas for the celebrations of the centenary of Eisenhower's birth. The move both ways was done as a special train at slow speed, since the locomotive and two cars from the command train used the British vacuum braking system, which was incompatible with the American air- braked trains. The locomotive is displayed with two British passenger carriages, once used as part of Eisenhower's Command Train. These have been restored to the condition they were in when used by Eisenhower. There have been some efforts to repatriate the locomotive back to the UK, most of which have been unsuccessful. However, in 2012, the National Railway Museum announced plans to repatriate the engine, along with 60010, which has been preserved in Canada, as part of a plan to reunite all six preserved A4s of the class for the 75th anniversary of the class's world record breaking 126 mph run. Both 60008 and 60010 were loaned to the National Railway Museum for a period of two years, returning to North America in early 2014.http://www.nrm.org.uk/AboutUs/PressOffice/PressReleases/2012/January/Repatriatinga4s.aspx While at York, the locomotive was cosmetically overhauled and received a new coat of authentic BR Brunswick Green paint to replace the inaccurate shade applied during a repaint at Green Bay. The background on the Dwight D. Eisenhower nameplates was also changed from a red colour to a black colour. In mid-August 2012, 60008 left its base in the Green Bay area and travelled to Halifax, Nova Scotia, where it met with 60010 arriving by rail in late September. On 3 October 2012, 60008 and 60010 arrived back in the UK at the Port of Liverpool. On 4 October 2012, 60008 began its journey to the National Railway Museum Shildon, arriving that evening. The locomotive moved to York soon after for its cosmetic restoration. The engine under cosmetic restoration in December 2012 The loco's cosmetic restoration was completed in February 2013 and the loco was then put on display in the Great Hall at the National Railway Museum in York, next to sister engine 4468 Mallard. 60008 and 4468 were later to meet up with the other four members of the class in a 2-week event at York from 3 July, called 'The Great Gathering', 75 years to the day that Mallard set the World Speed Steam record. Both 60008 and 60010 appeared at Barrow Hill Engine Shed along with Bittern (60019), as part of the 'East Coast Giants' event over the weekend of 8/9 February 2014. In August 2013, the move of the two North American-based A4s back to the UK was the subject of an episode of the television series Monster Moves. The final event in which 60008 was reunited with its five remaining A4 sisters was the 'Great Goodbye', held between 15 and 23 February 2014, at The National Railway Museum's Locomotion annex at Shildon. During this time, the National Railroad Museum was offered US$1 million by an undisclosed buyer for the engine to remain in the UK. The museum declined the offer and the engine remained on display at Shildon until mid-April 2014.http://trn.trains.com/Railroad%20News/News%20Wire/2014/03/Green%20Bay%20museum%20declines%20proposed%20sale%20of%20A4.aspx The engine, along with 60010 (which had been restored to its original number, 4489, as part of the exhibition plans) were covered in two layers of tarpaulins to protect and conceal them. In late April-early May, the covered engines were sent to the Port of Liverpool where they were loaded aboard the Atlantic Container Line's Atlantic Concert vessel for the voyage to Halifax. The engines were unloaded at the ports in Halifax on 11 May, where they were transferred on to flat cars to be taken by rail to their respective museums.http://shipfax.blogspot.ca/2014/05/pot-pourri.html 60008 arrived at the National Railroad Museum in the Green Bay suburb of Ashwaubenon on 6 June 2014 and, on 23 June, the museum had returned the engine to the display building in which it was displayed prior to leaving for the UK.http://fox11online.com/2014/06/23/eisenhower-steam-engine-moving-back-into- national-railroad-museum/ The museum officially unveiled the engine as part of a new World War II themed exhibit on 2 August 2014.  Modelling  In 2012 Bachmann released a model of 60008 to celebrate its return to the UK and in 2013 Hornby also released a limited edition model of 60008 along with the other 5 surviving A4s. In 2015, Hornby also released a model of it in its original garter blue livery and name, Golden Shuttle.

Life Keko was born in the Albanian capital, Tirana, on 2 September 1958, to cinematographer parents Endri and Xhanfise Keko. He studied at the Qemal Stafa High School, in Tirana, Albania. In 1979 he started his studies for Albanian language and literature in the University of Tirana, where he graduated in 1983. During his studies he met his wife Xhulieta, who studied English language and literature and later became a primary school teacher. Her parents were diplomats and served among others in China and Algeria.Biography of Teodor Keko - Devolli.net (in Albanian) The couple have two sons, born in the 1980s. =Career= Keko worked as a journalist for the literary newspaper Drita. When the Stalinist system dissolved in early '90s, Keko joined the opposition movement and the main opposition party, the Democratic Party of Albania, and was elected to Albanian parliament in March 1992. He quickly became critical of the newly elected Albanian President, Sali Berisha, whom he accused of authoritarianism. He and six others were expelled from the Democratic Party in August 1993 and, with two others who voluntarily left the party, formed the Democratic Alliance Party. Keko wrote for popular daily newspaper Koha Jon√´ (Our Time), strongly criticizing the first post-communist government, and later became editor of the Democratic Alliance Party newspaper Aleanca (The alliance) and of the weekly cultural and artistic magazine Aks (Axis). Together with the Albanian journalist Arben Kallamata he founded the \\"Independent League of Journalists\\". They also were involved in the foundation of the Albanian section of the Association of European Journalists. On March 10, 1994 Teodor Keko was assaulted by two men with brass knuckles outside his Tirana apartment and heavily injured. Keko blamed the then-government of being behind the attack. After Keko died in 2002 his wife and children moved to the Netherlands. In his honor a street in Tirana was renamed \\"Rruga Teodor Keko\\" (Teodor Keko Street). For several years, Keko contributed to Albanian politics, and from 1992-1996 he was a member of parliament, first for the Democratic Party and, from August 1993 for the Democratic Alliance Party. Teodor Keko began publishing his first works in the 1980s when he became famous for his short stories.Teodor Keko - Biography (in Albanian) =Obituary= Keko died aged 43 in Thessaloniki, Greece where he was receiving treatment, shortly after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. The well-known Albanian writer, politician and diplomat Besnik Mustafaj, gave the last speech. Among other things he said: Works His first major work, the novel Loja (The game), was praised. His other works include at least fifteen volumes of poetry, novels, drama, and especially short stories. The novel Lajm√´tarja e vdekjeve (The harbinger of deaths), was written during the political regime change. His last work, Holl√´sira fatale (Fatal details), was a bestseller in Albania in 2001. The works of Teodor Keko are being translated into English by Robert Elsie. The young Albanian director Eno Milkani based the script of his upcoming movie Shenjtorja (\\"The Saint\\") on Keko's Dymb√´dhjet√´ shenjtor√´, nj√´ profet dhe disa njer√´z (Twelve saints, a prophet and some people).

External assessment * Paper 1 (25 marks weighed at 30% for SL and 20% for HL, 1 hour) - Candidates answer four structured, short-answer questions on the prescribed subject studied. This paper is common to both SL and HL. * Paper 2 (30 marks weighed at 45% for SL and 25% for HL, 1 hour 30 minutes) - Candidates must answer two extended response questions, one on each topic studied. Each topic has a selection of 6 questions. This paper is common to both SL and HL. * Paper 3 (HL only: 45 marks weighed at 35% of the course, 2 hours 15 minutes) - Candidates must answer three extended response questions. There are two questions set for each section. Each option has a separate examination paper. External assessment accounts for 75% of the course grade at SL and 80% at HL. Internal assessment * Historical investigation (25 marks weighed at 25% for SL and 20% for HL, 20 hours) - Candidates research and write a historical investigation of 1500 to 2000 words. The topic can be freely chosen from any part of the syllabus. The investigation is internally marked and externally assessed by Jonathon. Internal assessment accounts for the remaining 25% of the course grade at SL and 20% at HL.  Economics SL & HL  The syllabus of the Economics course is divided into four sections ‚Äì microeconomics, macroeconomics, international economics, and development economics ‚Äì all of which receive approximately equal weight. All sections must be studied by all candidates, and questions of all will be posed in examinations. The Diploma programme Economics course is noted for focusing more on development than any other economics course at a pre-university level, and this is all part of the IB programmes' international perspective. The final exams consist of three papers for HL and two for SL. Paper 1 has consisted of multiple choice questions but has now been changed to answering one question from microeconomics and one question from macroeconomics, for each section one question is worth 10 marks and the other is worth 15 marks. Paper 2 involves answering two data response questions, one from international economics and the other from development economics, each data response question is worth 20 marks. Paper 3 involves calculations (only HL is required to do this paper). Internal assessment includes three commentaries of current news items involving the use of economic concepts and terminology. The time allowed for each exam is a strict limit of 90 minutes each for Paper 1 and Paper 2 (both SL and HL) and 1 hour for Paper 3 (HL only).  Psychology SL & HL  The focus of this course is the systematic study of behavior and mental process. The program studies three main perspectives as influences on human behavior: the biological, the cognitive and the sociocultural. It includes the examination of optional topics that include health psychology, abnormal psychology, developmental psychology, sports psychology and psychology of human relationships. Finally all students have to carry out their own experimental study as an internal assessment. Students at higher level study two options whereas standard level students study only one. Each of the perspectives should be explored using the following four compulsory topics: * development and cultural contexts * framework * methodologies * application. The aims of the psychology course at HL and at SL are to: * interpret and/or conduct psychological research to apply the resulting knowledge for the benefit of human beings * ensure that ethical practices and responsibilities are implemented in psychological inquiry * develop an understanding of the biological, social and cultural influences on human behaviour * develop an understanding of different theoretical processes that are used to interpret behaviour, and to be aware of how these processes lead to the construction and evaluation of psychological theories * develop an awareness of how applications of psychology in everyday life are derived from psychological theories * develop an appreciation of the eclectic nature of psychology * understand and/or use diverse methods of psychological inquiry. First, students must choose an experiment to replicate. When conducting the experiment, the IB demands that certain ethical guidelines be followed.IB Psychology Internal Assessment, August 2002 After the experiment has been completed, a written report must be produced detailing the experiment. The students are required to The external assessment, which is administered in May or November; the second year of the course is specially focused to the development of this assessment where the students are introduced to a variety of studies and the student is expected to draw connections between them. The test is divided into two parts, which are referred to as \\"papers\\". Using the internal and external assessment, IB calculates a grade value of one through seven.  Philosophy SL & HL  Philosophy is offered both as a standard and higher level Group 3 subject. It consists of both internal assignment (philosophical approach to an essay on current topic) and 2 (3 on higher level) externally assessed exam papers on core and optional topics. = Syllabus =  SL/HL core: Being Human  All students study the core theme which consists of six key concepts: * Identity * Personhood * Freedom * Mind and body * The self and the other * Human Nature  Options  SL students are required to study one theme from the following list. HL students are required to study two themes from the following list. * 1. Aesthetics * 2. Epistemology * 3. Ethics * 4. Philosophy and contemporary society * 5. Philosophy of religion * 6. Philosophy of science * 7. Political philosophy  Prescribed Text  All students are required to study one text from the ‚ÄúIB list of prescribed philosophical texts‚Äù shown below: * The Second Sex by Simone de Beauvoir * Meditations by Ren√© Descartes * Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion by David Hume * On Liberty by John Stuart Mill * On the Genealogy of Morality by Friedrich Nietzsche * Creating Capabilities by Martha Nussbaum * The Origin of Philosophy by Jos√© Ortega y Gasset * The Republic by Plato * The Life You Can Save by Peter Singer * The Ethics of Authenticity by Charles Taylor * Tao Te Ching by Laozi * Zhuangzi by Zhuangzi  HL extension: Exploring philosophical activity  * HL students are required to undertake a deeper exploration of the nature, function, meaning and methodology of philosophy. = Assessment =  Internal assessment  * SL and HL students are required to produce a philosophical analysis of a non- philosophical stimulus such as a poem, film scene, or painting. Information technology in a global society (ITGS) SL & HL The IB Diploma Programme information technology in a global society (ITGS) course is the study and evaluation of the impacts of information technology (IT) on individuals and society. It explores the advantages and disadvantages of the access and use of digitized information at the local and global level. ITGS provides a framework for the student to make informed judgments and decisions about the use of IT within social contexts. Requirements for SL : *External assessment: 2 exam papers (3 hours), counts 70% of the final mark *Internal assessment SL 30%: The requirement of the project is to develop an original IT solution to a real problem for a specified client. Requirements for HL: *External assessment: 3 exam papers (4.45 hours), counts 80% of the final mark *Internal assessment HL 20%: The requirement of the project is to develop an original IT solution to a real problem for a specified client. Practical computer work is conducted while researching for the project at Standard Level. As of exams starting in 2012 both HL and Sl students will take the Project. Geography (2011-2017) Geography involves the study and investigation of human relationships with the environment. =Syllabus= SL candidates study three themes - the core theme and two optional themes, while HL candidates study five themes - the core theme, three optional themes and the HL extension. SL/HL core All candidates must study this theme. Theme: Patterns and change (70 hours) * Topic 1: Populations in transition (19 hours) * Topic 2: Disparities in wealth and development (16 hours) * Topic 3: Patterns in environmental quality and sustainability (19 hours) * Topic 4: Patterns in resource consumption (16 hours) Options SL candidates must study two of the following seven themes (60 hours), while HL candidates must study three (90 hours). Teachers may teach more themes than prescribed so that the candidates have a greater freedom of choice in Paper 2, since all options are set on the same paper. * Option A: Freshwater - issues and conflicts (30 hours) * Option B: Oceans and their coastal margins (30 hours) * Option C: Extreme environments (30 hours) * Option D: Hazards and disasters - risk assessment and response (30 hours) * Option E: Leisure, sport and tourism (30 hours) * Option F: The geography of food and health (30 hours) * Option G: Urban environments (30 hours) HL extension HL candidates must study this theme. Theme: Global interactions (60 hours) * Topic 1: Measuring global interactions (4 hours) * Topic 2: Changing space - the shrinking world (12 hours) * Topic 3: Economic interactions and flows (8 hours) * Topic 4: Environmental change (8 hours) * Topic 5: Sociocultural exchanges (8 hours) * Topic 6: Political outcomes (10 hours) * Topic 7: Global interactions at the local level (10 hours) =Assessment= There are three assessment components at SL and four at HL. External assessment * Paper 1 (60 marks weighing 40% of the course for SL and 25% for HL, 1 hour 30 minutes) - Both SL and HL candidates sit the same paper assessing their knowledge on the core theme. ** Section A (45 marks; questions 1-4) consists of four compulsory short-answer questions, one on each of the four topics in the theme. Command terms indicate the depth of the answer required (e.g. evaluate indicates that more depth is required than define). ** Section B (15 marks; questions 5-7) consists of three extended response questions that require more in-depth treatment than in Section A, and are required to answer one. Questions are based on the core theme but may link with the optional themes as well. * Paper 2 (40 marks at SL and 60 marks at HL, both weighed to 35%, 1 hour 20 minutes at SL, 2 hours at HL) - This paper assesses knowledge on the optional themes studied. Essentially, SL and HL students sit the same paper except that SL candidates answer two questions and HL candidates answer three from the themes studied, for 20 marks each. The paper consists of 14 questions, two on each theme, and may also come with a resources booklet for certain questions. Each question has at least three parts - earlier parts are short-answer questions which may or may not require depth. The last part is a 10-mark extended response question which more depth is required. * Paper 3 (HL only: 25 marks weighing 20% of the course, 1 hour) - HL candidates are assessed on the HL extension in this paper, but knowledge of the core theme is assumed. Students choose one question to answer out of a choice of three. Each question has two parts worth 10 and 15 marks respectively. Both parts require essay-length and in-depth writing. The first part tests understanding and application, while the second tests synthesis and evaluation. External assessment accounts for 75% of the grade for the entire course at SL, and 80% of that at HL. Internal assessment * Fieldwork (30 marks weighing 25% of the course for SL and 20% for HL, 20 hours) - All candidates are required to complete a fieldwork investigation based on one or more themes in the syllabus and write a 2500-word report based on the collection of primary data, processing the data and evaluating the fieldwork. Secondary data may be collected but only play a smaller part in the fieldwork. Reports are marked according to seven criteria by the teacher and then sent for external moderation. The report demands the same from both SL and HL. Internal assessment accounts for the remaining 25% of the grade at SL and 20% at HL. Anticipated subjects In some cases, Standard level subjects can be studied in one year, as opposed to the two years for Higher level subjects. This gives students more study time in their final year of school, as well as the option to spend more hours on their higher level subjects. All anticipated subjects are studied at standard level. Availability Business and Management SL, Economics SL, Economics HL, ITGS SL, ITGS HL, Psychology SL and Philosophy SL are offered online to students enrolled in the IB Diploma Programme.Pamoja Education Courses Footnotes External links *IBHistory.net - Site dedicated to IB History *IB Psych Revision Blog 2011 Syllabus *www.geographyjim.org ‚Äì MYP and IB Diploma Geography *www.geographyalltheway.com ‚Äì Online Geography Resources *ibstudy.editthis.info The IB Study wiki * IB Geography Website www.geography.uden.pl   * * Category:International Baccalaureate ","title":"IB Group 3 subjects"},{"id":"2078585","text":"A white-headed dwarf gecko with tail lost due to autotomy. Autotomy (from the Greek auto- \\"self-\\" and tome \\"severing\\", Œ±·ΩêœÑŒøœÑŒøŒºŒØŒ±) or self-amputation is the behaviour whereby an animal sheds or discards one or more of its own appendages,(2000). The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition. usually as a self-defense mechanism to elude a predator's grasp or to distract the predator and thereby allow escape. Some animals have the ability to regenerate the lost body part later. Autotomy has multiple evolutionary origins and is thought to have evolved at least nine times independently in animalia. Vertebrates =Reptiles and amphibians= A lizard tail shed by autotomy An autotomised skink tail exhibiting continued movement marbled gecko indicates regeneration after autotomyalt=lizard with abrupt change in tail pattern Some lizards,Bellairs, A.D., and Bryant, S.V., (1985). Autotomy and regeneration in reptiles. In: Biology of the Reptilia. Vol. 15. C. Gans and F. Billet (eds.). John Wiley and Sons, New York. pp. 301‚Äì410 salamanders and tuataraCree, A. (2002). Tuatara. In: Halliday, Tim and Adler, Kraig (eds.), The New Encyclopedia Of Reptiles and Amphibians. Oxford University Press, Oxford, pp. 210‚Äì211. when caught by the tail will shed part of it in attempting to escape. In many species the detached tail will continue to wriggle, creating a deceptive sense of continued struggle, and distracting the predator's attention from the fleeing prey animal. In addition, many species of lizards such as Plestiodon fasciatus, Cordylosaurus subtessellatus, Holaspis guentheri, Phelsuma barbouri, and Ameiva wetmorei have elaborately colored blue tails which have been shown to divert predatory attacks toward the tail and away from the body and head. Depending upon the species, the animal may be able to partially regenerate its tail, typically over a period of weeks or months. Though functional, the new tail section often is shorter and will contain cartilage rather than regenerated vertebrae of bone, and in colour and texture the skin of the regenerated organ generally differs distinctly from its original appearance. However, some salamanders can regenerate a morphologically complete and identical tail. Some reptiles such as the crested gecko do not regenerate the tail after autotomy. Mechanism The technical term for this ability to drop the tail is caudal autotomy. In most lizards that sacrifice the tail in this manner, breakage occurs only when the tail is grasped with sufficient force, but some animals, such as some species of geckos, can perform true autotomy, throwing off the tail when sufficiently stressed, such as when attacked by ants.Rose, Walter; The Reptiles and Amphibians of Southern Africa; Pub: Maskew Miller, 1950 Caudal autotomy in lizards takes two forms. In the first form, called intervertebral autotomy, the tail breaks between the vertebrae. The second form of caudal autotomy is intravertebral autotomy, in which there are zones of weakness, fracture planes across each vertebra in the mid-part of the tail. In this second type of autotomy the lizard contracts a muscle to fracture a vertebra, rather than break the tail between two vertebrae. Sphincter muscles in the tail then contract around the caudal artery to minimize bleeding. Another adaptation associated with intravertebral autotomy is that skin flaps fold over the wound at the site of autotomy to readily seal the wound, which can minimize infection at the autotomy site. Caudal autotomy is prevalent among lizards; it has been recorded in 13 of approximately 20 families. Effectiveness and costs Caudal autotomy is present as an anti-predator tactic but is also present in species that have high rates of intraspecific competition and aggression. The Agama agama lizard fights by using its tail as a whip against other conspecifics. It can autotomize its tail but this is met with a social cost - tail loss decreases social standing and mating ability. For example, Uta stansburiana suffers reduced social status following caudal autotomy, while Iberolacerta monticola experiences reduced mating success. Among Coleonyx brevis, smaller eggs or no eggs at all are produced after the tail is lost. However, the regenerated tail in Agama agama takes on a new club-like shape providing the male with a better fighting weapon, such that autotomy and regeneration work together to increase the lizard's ability to survive and reproduce. There are also examples in which salamanders will attack the tails of conspecifics in order to establish social dominance and decrease the fitness of competitors. Despite this mechanism‚Äôs effectiveness, it is also very costly and is employed only after other defenses have failed. One cost is to the immune system: tail loss results in a weakened immune system which allows for mites and other harmful organisms to have a larger negative impact on individuals and reduce their health and lifespan. Since the tail plays a significant role in locomotion and energy storage of fat deposits, it is too valuable to be dropped haphazardly. Many species have evolved specific behaviors after autotomy, such as decreased activity, in order to compensate for negative consequences such as depleted energy resources. Some such lizards, in which the tail is a major storage organ for accumulating reserves, will return to a dropped tail after the threat has passed, and will eat it to recover part of the sacrificed supplies. Conversely, some species have been observed to attack rivals and grab their tails, which they eat after their opponents flee.Durrell, Gerald. My Family and Other Animals. Penguin Books 1987. There are also adaptations that help mitigate the cost of autotomy, as seen in the highly toxic salamander, Bolitoglossa rostrata, in which the individual will delay autotomy until the predator moves its jaws up the tail or holds on for a long time, allowing the salamander to retain its tail when toxicity alone can ward off predators. Regeneration is one of the highest priorities after autotomy, in order to optimize locomotor performance and recoup reproductive fitness. While regenerating their tails, caudal autotomy is restored at an energetic cost that often hinders body growth or intraspecies interactions.  Autotomy in the fossil record  Fossils of reptiles possessing the ability to autotomize that are not within the lizard family have been found that date back to the late Carboniferous and Early Permian Epoch. Two squamate species from the Jurassic period, Eichstaettisaurus schroederi and Ardeosaurus digitatellus, were identified as having intervertebral autotomy planes, and these species were placed in the squamate taxonomy as being an ancestor of current existing geckos. =Mammals= At least two species of African spiny mice, Acomys kempi and Acomys percivali, are capable of autotomic release of skin, e.g. upon being captured by a predator. They are the first mammals known to do so. They can completely regenerate the autotomically released or otherwise damaged skin tissue ‚Äî regrowing hair follicles, skin, sweat glands, fur and cartilage with little or no scarring. It is believed that the corresponding regeneration genes could also function in humans. Invertebrates Over 200 species of invertebrates are capable of using autotomy as an avoidance or protective behaviour. These animals can voluntarily shed appendages when necessary for survival. Autotomy can occur in response to chemical, thermal and electrical stimulation, but is perhaps most frequently a response to mechanical stimulation during capture by a predator. Autotomy serves either to improve the chances of escape or to reduce further damage occurring to the remainder of the animal such as the spread of a chemical toxin after being stung. =Molluscs= Autotomy occurs in some species of octopus for survival and for reproduction: the specialized reproductive arm (the hectocotylus) detaches from the male during mating and remains within the female's mantle cavity. Species of (land) slugs in the genus Prophysaon can self-amputate a portion of their tail.McDonnel, R.J., Paine, T.D. and Gormally, M.J., (2009). Slugs: A Guide to the Invasive and Native Fauna of California . 21 pp., , page 9. There is known autotomy of the tail of sea snail Oxynoe panamensis under persistent mechanical irritation. Some sea slugs exhibit autotomy. Both Discodoris lilacina and Berthella martensi will often drop their entire mantle skirt when handled, leading to Discodoris lilacina also being called Discodoris fragilis. The members of Phyllodesmium will drop a large number of their cerata each, on the tip having a large sticky gland that secretes a sticky substance. =Crustaceans= Autotomic stone crabs are used as a self-replenishing source of food by humans, particularly in Florida. Harvesting is accomplished by removing one or both claws from the live animal and returning it to the ocean where it can regrow the lost limb(s).Gulf and Florida Stone Crabs However, under experimental conditions, but using commercially accepted techniques, 47% of stone crabs that had both claws removed died after declawing, and 28% of single claw amputees died; 76% of the casualties died within 24 hours of declawing. The occurrence of regenerated claws in the fishery harvest is low; one study indicates less than 10%, and a more recent study indicates only 13% have regenerated claws. (See Declawing of crabs) Post-harvest leg autotomy can be problematic in some crab and lobster fisheries, and often occurs if these crustaceans are exposed to freshwater or hypersaline water in the form of dried salt on sorting trays.Davidson, G.W. and Hosking, W.W. (2004) Development of a Method for Alleviating Leg Loss During Post-harvest Handling of Rock Lobsters . 104 pp. The autotomy reflex in crustaceans has been proposed as an example of natural behaviour that raises questions concerning assertions on whether crustaceans can \\"feel pain\\", which may be based on definitions of \\"pain\\" that are flawed for lack of any falsifiable test, either to establish or deny the meaningfulness of the concept in this context. =Spiders= A fishing spider with two limbs missing Under natural conditions, orb-weaving spiders (Argiope spp.) undergo autotomy if they are stung in a leg by wasps or bees. Under experimental conditions, when spiders are injected in the leg with bee or wasp venom, they shed this appendage. But, if they are injected with only saline, they rarely autotomize the leg, indicating it is not the physical injection or the ingress of fluid per se that causes autotomy. In addition, spiders injected with venom components which cause injected humans to report pain (serotonin, histamine, phospholipase A2 and melittin) autotomize the leg, but if the injections contain venom components which do not cause pain to humans, autotomy does not occur. =Bees and wasps= Sometimes when honey bees (genus Apis) sting a victim, the barbed stinger remains embedded. As the bee tears itself loose, the stinger takes with it the entire distal segment of the bee's abdomen, along with a nerve ganglion, various muscles, a venom sac, and the end of the bee's digestive tract.Snodgrass, R.E. (1956). The Anatomy of the Honey Bee. Ithaca, New York: Cornell University Press. This massive abdominal rupture kills the bee. Although it is widely believed that a worker honey bee can sting only once, this is a partial misconception: although the stinger is barbed so that it lodges in the victim's skin, tearing loose from the bee's abdomen and leading to its death, this only happens if the skin of the victim is sufficiently thick, such as a mammal's.How Bees Work ‚Äì howstuffworks.com. Retrieved 23 April 2013. The sting of a queen honey bee has no barbs, however, and does not autotomize. All species of true honey bees have this form of stinger autotomy. Two wasp species that use sting autotomy as a defense mechanism are Polybia rejecta and Synoeca surinama. The endophallus and cornua portions of the genitalia of male honey bees (drones) also autotomize during copulation, and form a mating plug, which must be removed by the genitalia of subsequent drones if they are also to mate with the same queen. The drones die within minutes of mating. =Echinoderms= Evisceration, the ejection of the internal organs of sea cucumbers when stressed, is also a form of autotomy, and they regenerate the organ(s) lost. Some starfish shed their arms. The arm itself may even be able to regrow into a new starfish.

Built for the LNER in 1937 at Doncaster Works as works number 1866, it was originally numbered 4464. Renumbered 19 on 16 August 1946 under the LNER 1946 renumbering scheme, it was renumbered 60019 by British Railways on 10 October 1948, after nationalisation. A Pacific 4-6-2 locomotive to the same design by Nigel Gresley as the more famous A4 Mallard and one of the 35 strong class, it is one of six to survive into preservation and is one of three currently certified for mainline use. In preservation, the locomotive has also worn the identities of a number of its scrapped classmates, including the first of the A4 class 2509 Silver Link and most recently as 4492 Dominion of New Zealand. Liveries Like the other members of its class, Bittern has worn many liveries throughout its career. When released to traffic on 18 December 1937, Bittern was wearing the garter blue livery that was standard for LNER A4 Pacific locomotives at that time. On 14 November 1941 it was repainted into wartime black with LNER markings on the tender. On 22 May 1943 the tender was modified with just the markings NE. It has sometimes been said that this was to confuse wartime spies, but the generally accepted view is that it was to save scarce materials and labour by reducing the number of letters by half. It has also been said that the change was to satisfy the vanity of the new Chief Mechanical Engineer, Edward Thompson, who was a product of the former North Eastern Railway, but this claim is widely discounted. Bittern remained in black until 7 March 1947 when repainted in LNER post-war garter blue with extra red/white lining. Bittern was repainted next on 28 July 1950 into British Railways dark blue with black and white lining. The final repaint for Bittern was into British Railways green on 12 February 1952. Bittern had some livery variations applied; some of the A4s had red backgrounds applied to their nameplates, which were normally black. Bittern was seen with a red background circa 1966. The green livery had variations. Normally the boiler bands were lined out except for the firebox boiler band, which was plain green. Bittern, and other Darlington based A4s received lining on the firebox boiler band as well. Some A4s had their shed name marked on the right-hand (looking from the front) buffer. Bittern was marked with Gateshead circa 1949 and Ferryhill shed (Aberdeen) later in the 1960s. Technical details Like most other A4s, Bittern was fitted with side valances and a single chimney from new. The valances were removed during an overhaul 22 September ‚Äì 14 November 1941. Her double chimney with a Kylchap double blastpipe was fitted on 6 September 1957. AWS (Automatic Warning System) was fitted 13 December 1958. Bittern was fitted with a full width bogie dust shield in 1950. The speed indicator was fitted 6 September 1960. Bittern has had fourteen boilers in her career, these were: 9020 (from new), 9025 (from the 4469 Sir Ralph Wedgewood after it had been destroyed at York depot during the Baedecker air raid), 23 January 1941; 9018 (from 4462 ), 22 May 1943; 8952 (spare), 14 October 1948; 8905 (from 60011), 28 July 1950; 29317 (new build boiler), 12 February 1952; 29298 (from 60020 Guillemot), 12 June 1953; 29279 (from 60009 Union of South Africa), 30 November 1954; 29320 (from 60020 Guillemot), 25 May 1956; 29315 (from 60022 Mallard), 6 September 1957; 29319 (from 60009 Union of South Africa), 13 December 1958; 29355 (newbuild boiler), 16 March 1960; 27971 (from 60017 Silver Fox), 27 April 1962 and finally 29332 (spare), 24 March 1965. Bittern has had just one tender throughout her career: 5638, of the non- corridor design. During the major overhaul which returned the engine to traffic in 2007 the tender was rebuilt as a corridor version to allow extra flexibility of operations. Career Initially Bittern was based at Heaton in Newcastle and hauled the famous Flying Scotsman train on the section between London King's Cross and Newcastle. Early in her career, Bittern suffered some collision damage, necessitating a general overhaul at Doncaster Works from 3‚Äì4 January 1938. Bittern was transferred to Gateshead on 28 March 1943. With World War II, the named expresses were cut back as the country went to war. Bittern lost her garter-blue paint for a wartime black and was required to pull longer-than-normal, and therefore very heavy, passenger trains. As the war continued the A4 locomotives were also to be seen hauling heavy freight and coal trains. This was not a task that the locomotives had been built for. The heavy loads and poor maintenance conditions took their toll, and by the end of the war the A4 locomotives were in a poor state. With the end of the war and nationalisation came better maintenance and the A4 class saw a return to the high-speed expresses of the pre-war years. Now in BR green Bittern hauled the Talisman from King's Cross to Edinburgh. Bittern was transferred to St Margarets on 28 October 1963. The A4 revival was short-lived, as the steam- pulled services were replaced by diesel-hauled services and Bittern was moved to Scotland and put into storage. After a short period Bittern was moved to Ferryhill, Aberdeen on 10 November 1963 and ran to Edinburgh and Glasgow. This service only lasted three years. Bittern has the dubious honour of heading the last A4 Glasgow to Aberdeen and thus bring the curtain down on 30 years of service. Bittern was withdrawn on 3 September 1966. When she was bought for preservation, 'Bittern' had several major problems, such as the frames being cracked quite badly. These problems were known to BR, but were only lightly repaired, since with the end of steam it would have been uneconomic to completely repair the loco. This in turn affected her life in preservation and only now have the important repairs been done so that she is up to mainline standard. Preservation Bittern was sold to Geoff Drury on 12 September 1966. It initially operated from York depot (site of the National Railway Museum today) on various steam charters, but the cracked frames and other symptoms of her long career soon spelled an end to her mainline career. In consequence Drury bought LNER Peppercorn Class A2 60532 Blue Peter from British Rail in 1968. Bittern and 60532 were moved to the Dinting Railway Centre, near Glossop. Neither locomotive did much running, and in late 1987 the NELPG took charge of both locomotives on long-term loan from the Drury family. While 60532 was moved to the Imperial Chemical Industries works at Wilton on Teesside, and restored to mainline running from December 1991; Bittern with its greater repair need was cosmetically restored to represent pioneer and long-gone sister 2509 Silver Link. It was initially displayed at the Stephenson Railway Museum in Newcastle-upon-Tyne in this livery. Silver Link was displayed at the National Railway Museum, York and on 3 July 1988 was displayed outside with 4468 Mallard and 4498 Sir Nigel Gresley. Mallard had just worked a charter train up from Doncaster, and Sir Nigel Gresley was discreetly used to make steam appear to come from Silver Link to give the impression she was in steam. 60009 Union of South Africa was unable to attend due to an overhaul. On the weekend of 5 July 2008, Bittern joined her three sisters for the first time ever on display at the National Railway Museum in York on the 70th anniversary of sister Mallard's run. In 1995, Silver Link was moved to the Great Central Railway in Loughborough to undergo restoration to working order, but this reached only a partial stage of dismantling. In 1997, Bittern was bought by Tony Marchington, and based at the Southall Railway Centre alongside his other locomotive which was also being overhauled at the time, LNER Class A3 4472 Flying Scotsman. In 2000, after the over budgeted ¬£1million restoration of Flying Scotsman was complete, Marchington sold Bittern to Jeremy Hosking, who moved her to the Mid-Hants Railway in Hampshire in January 2001, for full restoration. On 19 May 2007, Bittern was steamed for the first time since the 1970s. In authentic British Railways lined green livery and carrying her British Railways number, 60019, she hauled her first service train since the 1970s on 7 July 2007 after six years of restoration, numerous tests and modifications. She departed at 13:00 on 7 July 2007, during the Watercress Line's 'End of Southern Steam Gala', hauling their rake of dining coaches from Alresford to Alton. Since then she has been 'run in' and has been used on normal services, Santa specials and on 21, 22 and 23 March 2008 ran as 'Spencer' from the Thomas The Tank Engine stories during the Watercress Line's Day out with Thomas. (She was also booked as 'Spencer' from 9‚Äì17 August 2008.) Bittern was then sent to Southall depot in London, where she was configured to run with her water tender and support coach, both having originally been used with Flying Scotsman. After that, she completed brake and speed tests on a run to Bristol and soon after made her official return to mainline working on Saturday 1 December 2007 on a charter from London King's Cross to York, and since then has hauled several more railtours around Britain. Sheffield. Note the second tender. On 25 July 2009, Bittern made a 188-mile run from King's Cross to York non-stop using a second tender to avoid the need to stop en route to take on water and change crews, carrying the headboard \\"The Brighton Belle\\" to publicise the launch of the Brighton Belle restoration project by the 5BEL Trust.The Railway Magazine, August 2009 issue, 1 July 2009 With the first tender having a water capacity of 5,000 gallons and coal, and the second tender only used for carrying an extra 9,000 gallons of water, it was thought that this would give Bittern a range of about 250 miles; occasional stops are desirable in any case, for things such as mechanical checks and coal redistribution in the tender and firebox. A non-stop run on the East Coast Main Line had not been achieved since the 1968 King's Cross to Edinburgh hauled by 4472 Flying Scotsman, also with a second tender. In June in the Top Gear Race to the North, a run using the newly built locomotive 60163 Tornado had been achieved from London to Edinburgh on the ECML with water stops but no station stops, also a first since the 1968 run of No. 4472. Bittern crossing the Forth Bridge During the winter of 2010/2011 the locomotive received maintenance which included the cosmetic renaming and renumbering of the locomotive as scrapped classmate 4492 Dominion of New Zealand (BR number 60013). This conversion also included repainting the locomotive in LNER garter blue, the fitting of Gresley's original side valances (most of the valancing is from when the locomotive was masquerading as 2509 Silver Link) and the painting of its wheels in their original Coronation red colouring.\\"Dominion of New Zealand: it's here!\\", Heritage Railway 14 April 2011 As the original 4492 had a New Zealand Government Railways five-chime whistle fitted shortly after its introduction to service in 1937, a suitable whistle was borrowed from the Glenbrook Vintage Railway in New Zealand.This whistle was donated by the NZGR and equipped to the locomotive in place of its original chime whistle in 1937. When the locomotive was withdrawn in 1963 as BR 60013, the whistle was supposedly 'stolen' before the locomotive was scrapped. The original Dominion of New Zealand was one of five A4s named after Commonwealth countries to pull \\"The Coronation\\" service, so named to celebrate the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in 1937.4492 Dominion of New Zealand Two of the five \\"Coronation\\"-named A4s survive in preservation - 4489 Dominion of Canada at the Canadian Railway Museum in Delson, Quebec, and 60009 Union of South Africa, owned by John Cameron and which makes regular appearances on the main line. The locomotive was due to remain in this livery for three years, however when 4464 emerged from its winter maintenance in 2012, The locomotive had reverted to its LNER identity as 4464 Bittern in gold leaf lettering. To celebrate the 75th anniversary of sister locomotive Mallard completing its record breaking 126 mph run, Bittern ran three special charter runs along the East Coast Main Line, during which it became the first locomotive in preservation to be allowed to break the 75 mph speed limit that steam locomotives have on the UK mainline. Network Rail allowed 4464 to run up to 90 mph, as long as it passed some rigorous tests beforehand. All of these charters involved Bittern operating to and from York so it could still be displayed along with the five other preserved A4s (including Mallard) at the National Railway Museum. On 29 June 2013, Bittern set a new speed record for a British preserved steam locomotive, and according to official timers on the footplate, it achieved a maximum speed of near Arlesey, Bedfordshire on the first of its planned \\"high speed\\" runs, \\"The Ebor Streak\\" that ran from London King's Cross to York. The remaining two runs were originally scheduled for July, but the heatwave during the summer, as well as further weather issues later in the year, caused the services, the York-Newcastle \\"Tyne Tees Streak\\" and the York-London King's Cross \\"Capital Streak\\" to be rescheduled for 5 December and 7 December 2013 respectively. During the \\"Tyne Tees Streak\\" run, Bittern broke its own speed record set just a few months prior by reaching a maximum speed of 93 mph (149.7 km/h). In 2014, Bittern was fitted with two commemorative plaques, similar to those worn by sister locomotives Mallard and Sir Nigel Gresley, in honour of her 90 mph runs. Just prior to the expiry of its mainline certificate on 1 January 2015, the locomotive was moved again to the Mid-Hants Railway, where it ran during 2015 before being withdrawn from service for a major overhaul at LNWR, Crewe. As of May 2018 Bittern is stored in the queue of engines awaiting workshop space, as Crewe LSL is focused on getting 60532 and 70000 back mainline. Models Bachmann released a model of 60019 while it was still in BR Green. In 2013 Hornby released a limited edition of 1,000 models of Bittern as 60019 in Green, with double tenders, as for its non-stop run from London to York in 2009. This was followed in 2014 by a very limited edition set of the six surviving A4s as 'The Great Goodbye' collection, including Bittern as 4464 in Garter Blue and with full valances. In 2019 Hornby are releasing limited edition models of engines in the 1:1 collection, including Bittern in LNER Garter Blue with two tenders and gold lettering, as preserved.

The station is about three minutes' walk from The Mall Shopping Centre. It is situated on the Midland Main Line and is operated by Thameslink. History It was built by the Midland Railway in 1868 on its extension to St. Pancras. For some years it was known as Luton Midland Road to distinguish it from the earlier Luton Bute Street, built in 1858 on the GNR line from Hertford North to Leighton Buzzard. To build the line a public area known as the \\"Great Moor\\" had to be built through. The remainder of the land was bought for development by John Crawley, who provided a replacement in what is known as the \\"People's Park.\\" This proved a worthwhile investment because, as the town's staple trade in straw hats diminished as they went out of fashion, it was replaced by engineering works. By the beginning of the twentieth century, the population had nearly trebled and the station had become an important stop for main line expresses. =London, Midland and Scottish Railway= The station, consisting of only 3 platforms was rebuilt in 1939 to the designs of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway company architect William Henry Hamlyn. =British Rail era= In 1960 a fourth platform was added. During electrification in the early 1980s a fifth platform was added for the suburban services to and from St. Pancras.Radford, B., (1983) Midland Line Memories: a Pictorial History of the Midland Railway Main Line Between London (St Pancras) & Derby London: Bloomsbury Books =Privatisation= Upon the opening of Eurostar at St. Pancras International, through-fares to continental Europe were made available from Luton and 67 other UK towns and cities to Paris, Brussels and other destinations in France and Belgium. The station is set for significant investment from both Network Rail and First Group to improve facilities for customers as well as creating longer platforms as part of the Thameslink Programme. In 2009 the station was identified as one of the ten worst category B interchange stations for mystery shopper assessment of fabric and environment, and is set to receive a share of ¬£50 million funding for improvements. During 2010 and 2011 a number of improvements took place at the station, these included extensions to all five platforms (including removing the barrow crossing) and a new footbridge. The platform extensions form part of the Thameslink Programme and allow 12 car operation at the station. During these works two new rail overbridges were installed over Old Bedford Road allowing the track to be slewed for the extended platforms.  Services  Luton station is served by Thameslink and East Midlands Railway trains. From Luton, trains go north to Bedford, Kettering, Corby, Melton Mowbray, Leicester, Nottingham, Derby and Sheffield. Southbound trains go to London, Gatwick Airport, Brighton, Greenwich, Dartford, Gillingham, Wimbledon and Sutton. The typical off peak service from this station as of May 2020 is as follows: *4 trains per hour (tph) to Bedford via Leagrave, Harlington and Flitwick (operated by Thameslink) *2 tph to Brighton via Luton Airport Parkway, Harpenden, St Albans, Central London and Gatwick Airport (Thameslink) *2 tph to Gatwick Airport via Luton Airport Parkway, Harpenden, St Albans, Central London and Redhill (Thameslink) *2 tph to Rainham via Luton Airport Parkway, Harpenden, St Albans, Central London, Greenwich, Charlton, Abbey Wood, Dartford, Gravesend and Gillingham (Thameslink) *1 tph to Corby calling at Bedford, Wellingborough, and Kettering. (East Midlands Railway) *1 tph to London St Pancras International only. (East Midlands Railway) *During the peaks, Thameslink run services to Orpington, East Grinstead and Littlehampton via central London. *East Midlands Railway InterCity services to and from Leeds, Nottingham, Sheffield and Derby (Limited service, late evenings and Sundays only) Thameslink trains serve several stations in Central London, including London St Pancras International, Farringdon, City Thameslink, Blackfriars and London Bridge. =Bus interchange= Luton Station Interchange in front of the station building provides interchange with local and regional bus services. *The Luton to Dunstable Busway serves Luton Station Interchange. This guided bus route, opened in 2013, provides bus rapid transit services 24 hours a day between Dunstable, Houghton Regis, Luton town and Luton Airport. *1 bus per hour to Milton Keynes Central operated by Stagecoach in Bedford (99) (formerly Virgin Trains). This starts at Luton Airport and only calls at a limited number of express bus stops en route. *1 bus per hour to Luton Airport forming the return portion of the above There was previously a shuttle bus service from the station to nearby London Luton Airport. However, the dedicated shuttle ceased following the construction of Luton Airport Parkway station. There are still regular buses via the Busway to Luton Airport via Arriva's A bus, and the Stagecoach hourly 99 bus service also runs directly to the Airport terminal.  Facilities  Luton station has the following facilities: *2 waiting rooms *Newsagent *Cafe *Telephones *ATM *Ticket barriers *FastTicket machine *Toilets *Car Park with 669 spaces *The station participates in the Plusbus scheme where train and bus tickets can be bought together for a cheaper price. It is in the same area as Luton Parkway and Leagrave stations. 1955 accident On 22 December 1955, two passenger trains collided at Luton station. One passenger was killed, and 23 injured. The first train, a local service from St Pancras to Leicester, had been given the \\"right away\\" from Luton and started to leave the station, but came to a halt when some late passengers attempted to board. As the train was clear of the Home signal, the signalman accepted the second train, an express from St Pancras to Derby. The signals were left at \\"Danger\\", so the Derby train should have stopped at the Home signal until the Leicester train had left the station. However, the driver of the Derby train failed to observe the Distant signal, and only made an emergency brake application when he saw the Home signal at danger, from a distance of approximately . He was unable to stop the train in time, and it collided with the stationary Leicester train. The rear two coaches of the Leicester train telescoped into each other, causing the majority of casualties. The official enquiry held the driver of the Derby train responsible for the collision, but also noted that the lights from the nearby Vauxhall factory obscured the view of the Distant signal. The lighting was reorganised following the accident. 1976 accident A passenger train being operated by a diesel multiple unit overran signals and collided with another diesel multiple unit at Luton South Signal Box. An express passenger train then collided with the wreckage, striking it with a glancing blow. 7 July 2005 London bombings On the day of the bombings, the four suicide bombers were seen on CCTV entering the station.

The former formalism represent the data structures aspects, while the latter stands for the behavioral and concurrent aspects of systems. In order to deal with large specifications some structuring capabilities have been introduced. The object-oriented paradigm has been adopted, which means that a CO-OPN specification is a collection of objects which interact concurrently. Cooperation between the objects is achieved by means of a synchronization mechanism, i.e., each object event may request to be synchronized with some methods (parameterized events) of one or a group of partners by means of a synchronization expression. A CO-OPN specification consists of a collection of two different modules: the abstract data type modules and the object modules. The abstract data type modules concern the data structure component of the specifications, and many sorted algebraic specifications are used when describing these modules. Furthermore, the object modules represent the concept of encapsulated entities that possess an internal state and provide the exterior with various services. For this second sort of modules, an algebraic net formalism has been adopted. Algebraic Petri nets, a kind of high level nets, are a great improvement over the Petri nets, i.e. Petri nets tokens are replaced with data structures which are described by means of algebraic abstract data types. For managing visibility, both abstract data type modules and object modules are composed of an interface (which allows some operations to be visible from the outside) and a body (which mainly encapsulates the operations properties and some operation which are used for building the model). In the case of the objects modules, the state and the behavior of the objects remain concealed within the body section. To develop models using the CO-OPN language it is possible to use the COOPNBuilderCOOPNBuilder framework that is an environment composed of a set of tools destinated to the support of concurrent software development based on the CO-OPN language.

Liveries As with the other members of the 35-strong class, Sir Nigel Gresley wore many liveries throughout its career. It was released to traffic on 30 October 1937 in the standard LNER garter blue of the A4 Pacifics. New numbers and letters for the tender in stainless steel were added in a general overhaul 16 January 1939. Sir Nigel Gresley was repainted into wartime black with LNER markings on 21 February 1942. The next repaint was into black with NE markings on 20 October 1943, as a cutback. After the war, Sir Nigel Gresley regained LNER garter blue livery with red/white lining on 6 March 1947. With the formation of British Railways came new liveries and Sir Nigel Gresley was painted into British Railways dark blue with black and white lining on 27 September 1950. The final livery change was into British Railways brunswick green livery on 17 April 1952. In preservation, Sir Nigel Gresley wore garter blue (with stainless steel letters and numbers as 4498 added later) from 1966 until its overhaul in the late 1990s, when it gained its current British Railways blue livery as 60007. This livery was retained again after the 2006 overhaul. Technical Details As with the earlier LNER A4 Pacifics, Sir Nigel Gresley was built with single chimney and side valances covering the wheels. The valances were removed to aid in maintenance on 21 February 1942. Sir Nigel Gresley gained its double chimney and Kylchap double blastpipe on 13 December 1957. 60007 also gained AWS equipment on 27 September 1950. A Smith-Stone type speed recorder was fitted on 30 June 1960. Sir Nigel Gresley has had twelve boilers in its career: 8961 (from new); 8946 (from 4483 Kingfisher), 21 February 1942; 9489 (new boiler), 6 March 1947; 29271 (from 60024 Kingfisher), 27 September 1950; 29319 (new build), 17 April 1952; 29306 (spare), 19 October 1953; 29321 (from 60010 Dominion of Canada), 12 March 1955; 29314 (from 60026 Miles Beevor), 13 April 1957; 29324 (from 60015 Quicksilver), 13 December 1957; 29331 (new build), 16 April 1959; 27970 (new build), 7 October 1960 and finally 27966 (from 60016 Silver King), 25 October 1962. Sir Nigel Gresley had two tenders in its career: 5329 from new build to 8 August 1943 and then 5324 from that time.  Career  Built for the LNER in 1937, and the 100th Gresley Pacific built. Its Doncaster Works number was 1863. It was originally numbered 4498. It is a 4-6-2 locomotive to the same design by Sir Nigel Gresley as the more famous Mallard. Locomotive 4498 was actually due to receive the name Bittern, originally suggested for 4492 (later Dominion of New Zealand). So the story goes, an LNER enthusiast who worked in the Railway Correspondence and Travel Society, realised in time that 4498 was the 100th Gresley Pacific locomotive and the suggestion was made that the locomotive be named after its designer. The name Bittern was later carried on 4464. Sir Nigel Gresley was allocated to Kings Cross Top Shed from new. As LNER locomotive 7, it was reallocated to Grantham on 23 April 1944, but sent back to Top Shed on 4 June 1950. Top Shed kept 60007 until the depot was closed, then Sir Nigel Gresley was reallocated to New England shed on 16 June 1963. Sir Nigel Gresley was then allocated to St Margarets shed, to work the Edinburgh - Aberdeen trains, until final shed allocation was to Aberdeen on 20 July 1964. Sir Nigel Gresley received a repaint at Doncaster Works 25 February 1938, and larger coal space was also provided as the locomotive was displayed at an exhibition in Manchester. Sir Nigel Gresley was also used for the opening of the Rugby testing station from 23 August - 8 October 1948. 60007 was placed onto the rollers without her tender and run up to high speeds to monitor the coal and water usage of the locomotive. Sir Nigel Gresley is the holder of the postwar steam record speed of gained on 23 May 1959 and carries a plaque to that effect. As with Mallards record, this was descending southward from Stoke Summit, but unlike Mallard's run which was a special attempt, this was with a full train of passengers returning from an excursion to Doncaster works. The excursion exceeded on two other occasions on the same day. As the nominated member of the British Transport Commission's Eastern area board, Alan Pegler was on the locomotive's footplate that day.  Preservation  Withdrawn from service by British Railways on 1 February 1966, it was targeted by the A4 Preservation Society, which was soon renamed the A4 Locomotive Society, to rescue the locomotive from the cutter‚Äôs torch. This was achieved, and the \\"Streak\\" was moved to Crewe for refurbishment. Fellow A4 No 60026 Miles Beevor also subsequently visited the former LMS works after its own withdrawal, and its three pairs of 6 ft 8 in driving wheels were transferred to No. 60007 because they were in a far better condition than those on the newly saved engine. For a long period of its preservation, Sir Nigel Gresley was kept at Steamtown Carnforth, at the old locomotive depot. This was a prime location for her mainline operations, being the only mainline A4 after 1973 other than Union of South Africa. On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of Mallard's record run on 3 July 1988, the National Railway Museum assembled three of the four UK-based A4 Pacific locomotives at the museum, the first time this had ever been done in preservation. Early in July 2008, SNG joined its three sibling-locomotives in the UK for a display at the National Railway Museum in York. During 1994, Sir Nigel Gresley spent some time at the Great Central Railway then at the East Lancashire Railway. The locomotive then moved to the North Yorkshire Moors Railway in 1996, and is now based there. It is owned by Sir Nigel Gresley Locomotive Preservation Trust Ltd. and operated by the A4 Locomotive Society Ltd. on behalf of the Trust. In 2010, Sir Nigel Gresley underwent repair at the North Yorkshire Moors Railway after its winter overhaul in 2009/10 revealed that extensive work and repair was needed on the tubing,Chime - Voice of the Sir Nigel Gresley Locomotive Preservation Trust, the quarterly journal of the A4 Preservation Society. and since then the locomotive has had two other significant mechanical failures,Steam Railway issue 409 (December 2012), page 56, though these were also resolved. 60007's most recent boiler ticket expired in September 2015, and the locomotive was therefore withdrawn from service for another overhaul which is being carried out in public view at the National Railway Museum in York,http://www.nymr.co.uk/our-steam-locomotives/. The boiler was sent to the Llangollen Railway for overhaul and was reunited with the locomotive frame on 7 November 2019.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8U8ZdA7Gxqo  Models  Sir Nigel Gresley was the first tender locomotive model released in OO gauge, and produced in both clockwork and 3-rail 12v DC electric forms by Hornby for the launch of their new Dublo system in 1938. It was modelled with a heavy diecast 'Mazak' body and chassis, and finished in contemporary LNER Garter Blue livery with side skirts and tin-plate corridor tender. The casting was modified to remove the sideskirts on commencement of postwar production in 1947, when realistic Walshacerts valvegear was fitted to reflect the locomotive in early BR ownership. Bachmann released several models of 60007; Weathered Single Chimney, Weathered Double Chimney and Pristine double chimney all in BR Express Passenger Blue. Hornby also released three models; one with a support coach and one without one, all having double chimneys and in BR Express Passenger Blue. Hornby sold their third model in 2013 for the Great Gathering Range along with the other surviving members of the class. Hornby also marketed an N-gauge model of 'Sir Nigel Gresley' (as catalogue item 'N214'). This N-gauge model was actually manufactured by Minitrix of (the then) West Germany in 1983, as Minitrix article number '51-2946-00'.

Origin  Spacecraft design was born as a discipline in the 1950s and 60s with the advent of American and Soviet space exploration programs. Since then it has progressed, although typically less than comparable terrestrial technologies. This is for a large part due to the challenging space environment, but also to the lack of basic R&D;, and to other cultural factors within the design community. On the other hand, another reason for slow space travel application design is the high energy cost, and low efficiency, for achieving orbit. This cost might be seen as too high a \\"start-up-cost.\\" Areas of engineering involved Spacecraft design brings together aspects of various disciplines, namely: * Astronautics for mission design and derivation of the design requirements, * Systems engineering for maintaining the design baseline and derivation of subsystem requirements, * Communications engineering for the design of the subsystems which communicate with the ground (e.g. telemetry) and perform ranging. * Computer engineering for the design of the on-board computers and computer buses. This subsystem is mainly based on terrestrial technologies, but unlike most of them, it must: cope with space environment, be highly autonomous and provide higher fault-tolerance. ** It may incorporate space qualified radiation-hardened components. * Software engineering for the on-board software which runs all the on-board applications, as well as low-level control software. This subsystem is very similar to terrestrial real-time and embedded software designs, * Electrical engineering for the design of the power subsystem, which generates, stores and distributes the electrical power to all the on-board equipment, * Control theory for the design of the attitude and orbit control subsystem, which points the spacecraft correctly, and maintains or changes the orbit according to the mission profile; the hardware used for actuation and sensing in space is usually very specific to spacecraft, * Thermal engineering for the design of the thermal control subsystem (including radiators, insulation and heaters), which maintains environmental conditions compatible with operations of the spacecraft equipment; This subsystem has very space-specific technologies, since in space, radiation and conduction usually dominate as thermal effects, by opposition with Earth where convection is typically the main one, * Propulsion engineering for the design of the propulsion subsystem, which provides means of transporting the spacecraft from one orbit to another, * Mechanical engineering for the design of the spacecraft structures and mechanisms, as well as the selection of materials for use in vacuum. These include beams, panels, and deployable appendages or separation devices (to separate from the launch vehicle). Spacecraft Subsystems =Structure= The spacecraft bus carries the payload. Its subsystems support the payload and helps in pointing the payload correctly. It puts the payload in the right orbit and keeps it there. It provides housekeeping functions. It also provides orbit and attitude maintenance, electric power, command, telemetry and data handling, structure and rigidity, temperature control, data storage and communication, if required. The payload and spacecraft bus may be different units or it may be a combined one. The booster adapter provides the load-carrying interface with the vehicle (payload and spacecraft bus together). The spacecraft may also have a propellant load, which is used to drive or push the vehicle upwards, and a propulsion kick stage. The propellant commonly used is a compressed gas like nitrogen, liquid such as monopropellant hydrazine or solid fuel, which is used for velocity corrections and attitude control. In a kick stage (also called apogee boost motor, propulsion module, or integral propulsion stage) a separate rocket motor is used to send the spacecraft into its mission orbit. While designing a spacecraft, the orbit which is going to be used should be considered into the point as it affects attitude control, thermal design, and the electric power subsystem. But these effects are secondary as compared to the effect caused on the payload due to the orbit. Thus while designing the mission; the designer selects such an orbit which increases the payload performance. The designer even calculates the required spacecraft performance characteristics such as pointing, thermal control, power quantity, and duty cycle. The spacecraft is then made, which satisfies all the requirements. =Attitude Determination and Control= The attitude determination and control subsystem (ADCS) is used to change the attitude (orientation) of the spacecraft. There are some external torques acting on the spacecraft along the axis passing through its center of gravity which can reorient the ship in any direction or can give it a spin. The ADCS nullifies these torques by applying equal and opposite torques using the propulsion and navigation subsystems. Moment of inertia of the body is to be calculated to determine the external torques which also requires determination of vehicle's absolute attitude using sensors. The property called 'gyroscopic stiffness' is used to reduce the spinning effect. The simplest spacecraft achieve control by spinning or interacting with the Earth's magnetic or gravity fields. Sometimes they are uncontrolled. Spacecraft may have several bodies or they are attached to important parts, such as solar arrays or communication antennas which need individual attitude pointing. For controlling the appendage's attitude, actuators are often used, with separate sensors and controllers. The various types of control techniques used are: * Passive Control Techniques. * Spin Control Techniques. * Three-axis Control Techniques. =Telemetry, tracking, and command= Telemetry, tracking, and command (TT&C;) is used for communication between spacecraft and the ground systems. The subsystem functions are: * Controlling of spacecraft by the operator on Earth * Receive the uplink commands, process and send them to other subsystems for implication. * Receive the downlink commands from subsystems, process and transmit them to Earth. * Inform constantly about the spacecraft position. =Communication= The process of sending information towards the spacecraft is called uplink or forward link and the opposite process is called downlink or return link. Uplink consists of commands and ranging tones where as downlink consists of status telemetry, ranging tones and even may include payload data. Receiver, transmitter and a wide-angle (hemispheric or omnidirectional) antenna are the main components of a basic communication subsystem. Systems with high data rates may even use a directional antenna, if required. The subsystem can provide us with the coherence between uplink and downlink signals, with the help of which we can measure range-rate Doppler shifts. The communication subsystem is sized by data rate, allowable error rate, communication path length, and RF frequency. The vast majority of spacecraft communicate using radio antennas -- satellite communication. A few spacecraft communicate using lasers‚Äîeither directly to the ground as with LADEE; or between satellites as with OICETS, Artemis, Alphabus, and the European Data Relay System. =Power= The electrical power subsystem (EPS) consists of 4 subunits : * Power Source (Battery, solar cell, fuelcells, thermoelectric couple) * Storage unit (No. of batteries in series) * Power Distribution (Cabling, switching, shock protection) * Power Regulation and Control (To prevent battery overcharging and overheating) =Thermal= Thermal control subsystem (TCS) is used to maintain the temperature of all spacecraft components within certain limits. Both upper and lower limits are defined for each component. There are two limits, namely, operational (in working conditions) and survival (in non-working conditions). Temperature is controlled by using insulators, radiators, heaters, louvers and by giving proper surface finish to components. =Propulsion= The main function of the propulsion subsystem is to provide thrust so as to change the spacecraft's translational velocity or to apply torques to change its angular momentum. There is no requirement of thrust and hence even no requirement of propulsion equipment in a simplest spacecraft. But many of them need a controlled thrust in their system, so their design includes some form of metered propulsion (a propulsion system that can be turned on and off in small increments). Thrusting is used for the following purposes: for changing the orbital parameters, to control attitude during thrusting, correct velocity errors, maneuver, counter disturbance forces (e.g., drag), and control and correct angular momentum. The propulsion subsystem includes a propellant, tankage, distribution system, pressurant, and propellant controls. It also includes thrusters or engines. An example architecture from the mid-2010s of a human spaceflight mission to Mars, as envisioned by the United States space agency, NASA.  Space mission architecture  Spacecraft design is always informed by the particular mission architecture of the spaceflight under consideration. Typically, a variety of mission architectures can be envisioned that would achieve the overall objective of the flight, whether those objectives be to gather scientific data or merely transport cargo across the space environment to serve any variety of purposes, governmental or economic. Spaceflight mission architectures will specify whether a spacecraft is to be autonomous or telerobotic, or even be crewed so as to deal with particular exigencies or goals of the mission. Other considerations include fast or slow trajectories, payload makeup and capacity, length of the mission, or the level of system redundancy so that the flight can achieve various degrees of fault-tolerance.

There were 35 A4 locomotives built in total. Originally numbered 4489, it was renumbered 10 on 10 May 1946, under the LNER 1946 renumbering scheme of Edward Thompson and, after nationalisation in 1948, British Railways added 60000 to its number so it became 60010 on 27 October 1948. It was renumbered back to 4489 following a cosmetic restoration at the National Railway Museum in York during late 2012 and early 2013.  Career  No. 60010 Dominion of Canada (left) at Doncaster Works in 1949 The locomotive was built in Doncaster works in May 1937 as Works Number 1854. It was originally to be named Buzzard but initially received the name Woodcock instead until it was renamed Dominion of Canada by High Commissioner of Canada, H. Vincent Massey on 15 June 1937. No. 4489 underwent trials, the only one of the 'Coronation' A4s so treated, and left in works grey lined in white. It had apple green painted coupled wheels. At this point it wore the name Woodcock, but this was removed before final painting and release to traffic. The Canadian Pacific Railway issue whistle was fitted 15 July 1937 for the unveiling and naming. The CPR-type bell fitted was steam operated and was actually used, as a photograph from 19 August 1939, illustrates. In 1937, locomotive 4489 was the locomotive used to try and take back the speed record previously taken by the LMS' passenger train, the Coronation Scot, which clocked at . Unfortunately, Locomotive 4489 achieved down Stoke Bank. It suffered damage in a collision at Hatfield and required attention at Doncaster Works from 31 January to 18 March 1939. Allocated to Kings Cross from new, it was reallocated to Grantham on 7 April 1957. The next shed was Kings Cross again on 15 September 1957. New England was the next allocation on 16 June 1963, after the closure of Kings Cross. The final allocation was to Aberdeen on 20 October 1963 to be used, along with other displaced A4s, primarily for the three-hour Aberdeen to Glasgow express service.  Liveries  Dominion of Canada has worn many liveries throughout its career. When released into traffic on 4 May 1937, No. 4489 wore the \\"paint shop grey\\" livery with apple green wheels until two weeks later when it was repainted in garter blue livery. The coat of arms of Canada was on the side of the cab and a CPR-type bell mounted ahead of the single chimney. As a livery variation, a stainless steel strip ran along the bottom of the valances and tender and the numbers and letters of the locomotive and tender were also stainless steel. This was due to the use of this locomotive and the other A4s named after British Commonwealth countries, on the Coronation service in order to match with the rolling stock. Other A4s named after British Commonwealth countries were (BR numbers) 60009 Union of South Africa, 60011 Empire of India, 60012 Commonwealth of Australia and 60013 Dominion of New Zealand. The bell was removed from 60010 Dominion of Canada when the chimney was replaced with a Kylchap double blastpipe and chimney on 27 December 1957. The stainless steel strip was removed along with the valances, but was left on the tender and simply painted over. Due to the position of the cabside coat of arms, the works plates were relocated inside the cab. The coat of arms of Canada worn on the side of the cabs were removed on 8 April 1949, but the works plates remained inside the cab. The next livery worn was wartime black with LNER on the tender on 21 February 1942. On 27 November 1943 the livery was modified to read just 'NE'. Dominion of Canada regained her LNER garter blue livery on 20 November 1947. British Railways dark blue with black and white lining was applied on 29 September 1950. The final livery change was British Railways brunswick green on 8 May 1952.  Technical details  Dominion of Canada had the Canadian Pacific Railway-type bell and 5-chime whistle removed in 1957 when the engine was refitted with a double chimney and kylchap exhaust to improve its steaming performance. The 5-chime whistle, which was replaced by a standard 3-chime whistle, was used at the whistles trial in Stratford for the new proposed British Railways 'Standard' Class locomotives and the bell was stored at Doncaster works. Dominion of Canada had eleven boilers throughout her career: 8952 (from new); 8908 (from 2510 Quicksilver), 21 February 1942; 9126 (from 4482 Golden Eagle), 10 May 1946; 9018 (from 19 Bittern), 8 April 1949; 29273 (from 60014 Silver Link), 29 September 1950; 29321 (New build), 27 August 1953; 29323 (from 60014 Silver Link), 17 February 1955; 29312 (from 60018 Sparrow Hawk), 1 June 1956; 29272 (from 60002 Sir Murrough Wilson), 27 December 1957; 29307 (from 60028 Walter K. Whigham), 10 July 1959; and finally 27970 (from 60007 Sir Nigel Gresley), 5 December 1962. Dominion of Canada had six tenders through her career: 5326 from new, 5328 from 6 December 1937, 5647 from 29 June 1953, 5639 from 9 July 1953, 5328 from 27 August 1953 and lastly 5326 from 15 October 1960. Dominion of Canada had her side valances removed on 21 February 1942. A Smith-Stone speed indicator was added on 15 October 1960.  Preservation  60010 Dominion of Canada was withdrawn at Darlington shed on 29 May 1965 and on 5 July 1965 was marked in Darlington's records as 'for sale to be scrapped'. After 60010 was condemned and her double chimney was removed for either 60024 Kingfisher or 60004 William Whitelaw, both in the works at that time, she was placed behind Darlington motive power depot and forgotten. For many months it was left lying derelict, almost totally hidden in the weeds and rough bushes at the end of a siding from the MPD, nose into the embankment of the Haughton Road bridge in Darlington. Despite this being a busy main road, very few people were aware of the engine being enveloped by the undergrowth. Some time after Darlington MPD was closed on 26 March 1966, No. 60010 was moved to Crewe works for cosmetic restoration and repainted in BR Brunswick green livery due to the LNER garter blue livery's expense. No. 60010 Dominion of Canada on display at Exporail in August 1970 She was donated to the Canadian Railroad Historical Association (CRHA) by British Rail. Since May 1966, 60010 has been preserved by the CRHA at the Canadian Railway Museum at Delson/Saint-Constant, Quebec, near Montreal. The CPR bell and 5-chime whistle were shipped out with 60010, but were not refitted until its overhaul in 2012 due to the double chimney. Previously stored in a secure building with other equipment and locomotives, the engine was in a very poor cosmetic state, its front end in particular was badly damaged by a diesel engine's buckeye coupler when being moved into the building in 2008. A cosmetic restoration was originally planned for 2010, but for unknown reasons, did not go ahead. In 2011 the National Railway Museum in York announced that it would be bringing back 60010 (along with fellow A4 Dwight D Eisenhower ) to the UK for a 2-year period to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the record-breaking run of her classmate Mallard. The event marked the first time that all six surviving A4s had been together since preservation, and for 60010, marked the opportunity to reunite it with fellow Coronation engine 60009 Union of South Africa. In September 2012, 60010 was sent from the Canadian Railway Museum down to the docks in Halifax, Nova Scotia where she was reunited with 60008, and both were shipped at the end of September. After arriving back in the UK on the evening of 2 October 2012, both locomotives were unloaded the following morning at Liverpool Docks, where a press call had been arranged. On Saturday 6 October 2012, 60010 arrived at Shildon for brief display, after which her cosmetic restoration was carried out. On 19‚Äì20 October 2012, Union of South Africa visited Shildon as well, so that a line up of three Brunswick Green A4s could take place for the first time since the end of Eastern steam in 1966 - it was originally planned to be an earlier event and also feature 60007 Sir Nigel Gresley, but the A4s' shipping date was delayed, so 60007 could not be secured for the date due to commitments at the North Yorkshire Moors Railway. 4489's cosmetic restoration returned the locomotive to its original Coronation livery - LNER Garter Blue with her original number 4489, complete with side valances, single chimney, and stainless chrome trim, as well as chrome lettering and numbering. It was refitted with a Canadian-style chime whistle, and the commemorative bell that was originally removed when it was fitted with a double chimney and sent with the locomotive to Canada, but had not been reinstalled. The original boxes used to send the bell and bell mount to Canada were used to bring them back to the UK. In 2013, 60010's (now renumbered 4489) cosmetic restoration was completed and she was placed on display alongside Dwight D. Eisenhower and Mallard ready for the Mallard '75 celebrations later that year, where all six preserved A4's joined the display around the turntable inside the National Railway Museum. The story of the repatriation of Nos. 4489 and 60008 was covered in an episode of the documentary series Monster Moves. Both 60008 and 60010 appeared at Barrow Hill roundhouse along with Bittern (60019) as part of the \\"East Coast Giants\\" event over the weekend of 8/9 February 2014. 4489 was reunited with her five remaining A4 sisters for the final time at The National Railway Museum's Locomotion facility at Shildon for \\"The Great Goodbye\\" held 15‚Äì23 February 2014. After the exhibition, the engine and 60008 remained on display at Shildon until 24 April 2014, after which the engines were covered with dual-layered tarpaulins in preparation for their return journey. In late April-early May, the covered engines were sent to Port of Liverpool where they were loaded aboard the Atlantic Container Line's Atlantic Concert vessel for the voyage to Halifax. The engines were unloaded at the ports in Halifax on 11 May, where they were transferred on to flat cars to be taken by rail to their respective museums. No. 4489 arrived at the Canadian Railway Museum on 4 June 2014. During the weekend of 21 June, the Canadian Railway Museum placed 4489 on display in its Angus Exhibit Pavilion, alongside CP Royal Hudson #2850, which had hauled the Royal Train carrying King George VI and Queen Elizabeth across Canada. The track, formerly occupied by Canadian National diesel-electric no. 6765 (which was moved to another track within the pavilion), sits atop a recessed pit, allowing visitors to view 4489's inside Gresley conjugated valve gear and her middle cylinder.

It operated in competition with the National Cyclists' Union, a rivalry which lasted until the two merged in 1959 to form the British Cycling Federation. Background The National Cyclists' Union (NCU) had, since the end of the 19th century, banned racing on the roads, fearing the police would ban all cycling as a result. A call for a ban \\"evoked hardly any opposition because road conditions were such that the possibility of massed racing on the highway was never even envisaged.\\"Bill Mills, Personally Speaking, The Bicycle, UK, 22 July 1942, p8 \\"The position of cyclists on the roads of England and Wales had not been established and police forces had objected to cyclists racing. Matters came to a head on 21 July 1894 during a timed race on the North Road, then the main road north out of London, in which 50 riders competed with the help of other riders to pace them. A group of riders passed a woman and her horse and carriage at a point about 57 miles from the capital. The horse panicked, the riders fell off and the woman complained to the local police. They in turn banned cycle-racing on their roads.\\" The NCU administered not only road racing but track racing and ruled that its clubs were to move their races off the road and on to tracks, the forerunners of modern velodromes. Some clubs did but most were too far from any track and so a rebel movement began to organise not massed, paced races but individual competitions against the clock, over standard distances and held out in the countryside, in the early hours and in secret to avoid antagonising the police. The NCU and what became the Road Time Trials Council eventually became colleagues, each administering its own section of the sport, neither allowing massed racing. The war and Percy Stallard The National Cyclists Union was the international body for cycling in England and Wales and sent teams to the Olympic Games and to world championships. It also licensed riders to compete abroad in races such as Bordeaux‚ÄìParis. But teams had to be selected not in races akin to which they were being entered but in competitions held on private roads such as airfields and car-racing courses. One of the riders to be selected was an enthusiast from Wolverhampton, Percy Stallard. The experience of massed racing stimulated him and he believed that the NCU's objection to it on grounds that it would disrupt traffic and give cycling a bad name was pointless in wartime when petrol rationing had largely cleared the roads of vehicles. He wrote in December 1941 to A. P. Chamberlin of the NCU: :It is amazing to think that this is the only country in Europe where this form of sport is not permitted... There seems to be the mistaken idea that it would be necessary to close the roads. This, of course, is entirely wrong... There would be no better time than now to introduce this form of racing to the roads, what with the decreased amount of motor traffic and the important part that the cycle is playing in wartime transport. :I am convinced that to allow massed-start racing to recommence its career after the war on circuits is utter madness. Even before the war massed-start racing could not be counted as a national branch of the sport as it was only possible for riders living within easy reach of Donington and Brooklands [the two most circuits most used] to try their hand at the game, excepting on special occasions. It should be obvious to anyone the least bit interested that there cannot be a future to this form of racing while it is allowed to remain on the circuit. Stallard protested that the airfields and car circuits which were the only place that the NCU would allow massed racing had been taken by the Army and RAF. Chamberlin was not impressed and replied at the end of January to say that the NCU had considered the question but considered it unwise. The breakaway race In the first week of April Stallard sent letters on the notepaper of the bicycle shop that he ran to announce his plan for a 59-mile race from Llangollen to Wolverhampton on 7 June. \\"I just explained to the police what I was doing and told them that things like that were normal on the Continent, and they said they were happy and that they'd try to help\\", he said.\\"Up the League, Winning, 1989 He obtained sponsorship from the Wolverhampton Express and Star newspaper, offered any profits to the newspaper's Forces Comfort Fund, and recruited 40 riders to take part. He also asked the NCU and the Road Time Trials Council (RTTC) not to suspend those who took part \\"as this was liable to raise controversy detrimental to the sport.\\" Stallard's plan brought strong opposition not just from the NCU and RTTC but from the cycling establishment, particularly from the veteran administrator and writer George Herbert Stancer. His fear, and that of the NCU, was that asking the police for permission to hold a race ended the freedom of cyclists to hold races, or at any rate lone races against the clock, without interference. Under the headline A hopeless revolt, he wrote: :They have plunged into their dangerous experiment without regard for the consequences... I understand that the 'rebels' want to go on holding races by police permit and under police protection; and when this is withdrawn they are apparently content to put up the shutters and go out of business as promoters.... If we voluntarily place road-racing under police control, we sign its death warrant.... If we are to race on the road, for heaven's sake let us do it as free citizens, and not by permission of the police. Stancer's words influenced the NCU and it banned Stallard before the race had started. An agreement with the Road Time Trials Council meant that it too banned him. Stallard went ahead and his race finished, without incident, in front of a crowd at West Park. There were 34 riders, including two Dutchmen serving in the army in Britain. The programme, priced 2d, urged: \\"Onlookers are earnestly requested to remain on the pavements at all times during the race.\\" It also said that \\"The event is run with the kind permission of the Chief Constables of Denbighshire, Shropshire, Staffordshire and Wolverhampton.\\" Cycling reported: :More than a thousand people watched the finish of the massed-start race organised by Percy Stallard, from Llangollen to Wolverhampton, on Sunday afternoon. The Chief Constable of Wolverhampton, an inspector, a sergeant and 15 uniformed policemen kept the crowd back. Police cars and police motorcyclists patrolled portions of the course. A police motorcyclist led the racing men through the streets to the finish. E. A. Price, of Wolverhampton, won the sprint from his clubmate, C. J. Anslow. The report - in which the frequent mention of the police reflected the magazine's concerns as expressed by Stancer - went on to explain that the race had been banned by the NCU and the RTTC but that there had been no incidents other than a lorry backing on to the course. Fifteen riders finished and all those involved in the race were expelled from the NCU. Stallard was banned for life for refusing to account for himself to the NCU's management.

I just thought it was something that would be taken up by others. I thought that, when the point had been proved, the NCU would be only too pleased to find that they'd got a bit of activity. It had all been above board. The police had never seen one, of course, but I just told them it was in conformity with international practice and races of this type were organised in all different countries and they had no queries at all.\\" Further races were held elsewhere in the country and the clubs that organised them formed regional groups. The first was in the Midlands in July 1942, called by the Wolverhampton RCC.The Bicycle, UK, 8 July 1942 With nowhere to go but insistent that massed racing was the future, Stallard encouraged the groups to merge to form the British League of Racing Cyclists. The founding meeting was of 24 people at the Sherebrook Lodge Hotel, Buxton, Derbyshire on Sunday 14 November 1942. The founding members - they were listed by their initials rather than their names - were M. J. Gibson, S. A. Padwick, P. T. Stallard, E. F. Angrave, J. E. Finn, R.Jones, E. R. Hickman, G. Anstee, L. Plume, G. Truelove, C. J. Fox, L. Merrills, W. W. Greaves. E. Reddish, E. Thompson, R. Hartley, K. Swaby, Chas J. Fox, S. Copley, S. Cooper, K. Pattinson, G. Clark, Mrs W. W. Greaves and Miss G. A. Stiff. Other riders and then whole clubs joined the BLRC. British cycle racing became polarised, frequently bitterly so. Clubs could not affiliate to both the NCU and the BLRC; riders who raced in BLRC races were banned from NCU events and from time trials run by the Road Time Trials Council. The magazine Cycling at first refused to report BLRC events. According to John Dennis, at the time racing editor of the rival paper, The Bicycle: :What has been lost beneath the clouds of myths surrounding this situation is the reason why many clubs were cautious about wholeheartedly supporting the road-racing movement. Remember that it was wartime and the younger membership of most clubs was away engaged in a war. The older members left at home did not wish to risk damaging a sport which all had enjoyed, so they decided to maintain the status quo until the war ended. The rank and file of the NCU/RTTC membership was not anti-BLRC - all it wanted to do was preserve the sport until the service men returned to civvy street.Dennis, John: Journal, Fellowship of Cycling Old Timers, vol 151 The BLRC itself wasn't that certain of its acceptance by the police. A sticker added to its membership licence read: :POLICE INTERFERENCE # Make no statement to the Police about anything happening during a Race. # If questioned, say 'I do not wish to make a statement.' # Any rider accused of any offence which he does not consider he has committed should add 'I deny that I ......... (whatever he is accused of).' # DO NOT SAY ANYTHING ELSE # Give full details to the organiser. In 1943, the League promoted the first British national road race championship, in Harrogate and later the Brighton-Glasgow stage race - a forerunner to the Daily Express Tour of Britain first run in 1951. See main entry - Tour of Britain. The BLRC also organised representative teams to races in other countries, although not through the international body, the Union Cycliste Internationale, by whom it wasn't recognised but through private arrangements with individuals, other breakaway organisations and sometimes through communist sports clubs which operated outside their own country's framework. From 1948 the BLRC sent a team to the Peace Race, Warsaw-Berlin- Prague, considered then the world's international amateur stage race. In 1952, Ian Steel won and Britain took the team prize. That led the UCI to recognise at least the existence of the BLRC. The Bicycle, UK, 11 March 1953 For the moment it said it would have to cooperate through the NCU but enthusiasts believed they had achieved international power. Representatives of the NCU walked out of the meeting before the vote, saying the UCI's proposal was unconstitutional. One of its delegates, H.S. Anderson said: \\"There is no provision in the statute of the UCI for provisional or temporary affiliation of a national federation. The committee resolution is invalid because it violates several statutes of the UCI.\\"The Bicycle, UK, 11 March 1953 Had they voted, the resolution would have failed.The Bicycle, UK, 11 March 1953 The Tour de France With the BLRC now halfway through the door, Britain sent a team to the Tour de France in 1955. It was the first team ever sent since the previous riders, Bill Burl and Charles Holland had competed as private entrants before the war. To turn down the Tour was something the NCU wouldn't do and yet it couldn't select riders who were BLRC members. To leave out BLRC members, however, would be to send a weakened team and antagonise a wavering UCI. Yet the BLRC could not select a team because the Union Cycliste Internationale didn't formally recognise it. The conundrum was solved by asking a panel of newspaper reporters to do the job instead. The beginning of the end Running the BLRC was never easy and there were frequent rows within its administration. The organiser of the first big stage race, Jimmy Kain, wrote to Stallard after the BLRC had merged with the BCF of the \\"two years of nervous and physical breakdown that followed the six years of BLRC office.\\"Letter 1 January 1979 Stallard was a bright and energetic man with a vision for his sport. But he was not a man to tolerate argument or those with other views. Peter Bryan, editor of The Bicycle, later an associate of Sporting Cyclist and managing editor of Cycling said: :Stallard had the most abrasive nature that I have ever met. He could never believe that he could have a bad idea or make a bad decision. And sometimes he'd go berserk with those who disagreed with him. He didn't have, let us say, the delicacies of negotiation.Woodland, Les (2005), This Island Race, Mousehold Press, Having achieved what he wanted, with the NCU's final acceptance of massed racing on the road, Stallard placed the continuity of the BLRC over the end of the civil war that the BLRC and the NCU had conducted. He said: \\"The NCU were running road races and we were running road races and there wasn't any need for amalgamation [of the NCU and the BLRC, to form the British Cycling Federation] at all.\\" Critics said Stallard had lost sight of the intention of the BLRC, which had been to bring racing to the open road and that, once achieved, that there was no further point in rival cycling administrations. Peter Bryan said: \\"The BLRC was originally a gang of enthusiasts. Then along came what I'd call the parliamentarians of pedal power, men who saw a runaway organisation and decided they'd take it over.\\" Stallard was influenced by those who agreed with him but in the end he and others became too much for the BLRC's other administrators and the BLRC magazine, The Leaguer, reported in 1954: \\"There is a malignant ulcer prevalent in the cycling world common to all three racing bodies in this country. It is the taint of vanity and culminates in the clash of personality.\\" With both the BLRC and the NCU physically and financially reeling from a civil war that had long outlasted the war with Germany, the two merged in 1959 to form the British Cycling Federation, now known as British Cycling. The January 1959 edition of the BLRC magazine, The Leaguer, reported formally: :This Annual General Meeting of the British League of Racing Cyclists agrees that all assets, liabilities, obligations and commitments of the British League of Racing Cyclists shall be transferred to or handed over to the British Cycling Federation as from the date of the incorporation of that body. The text accompanying the announcement said: :It was evident, even before the decisions of this 17th and final Annual General Meeting of the British League of Racing Cyclists were taken, that League Sections and Union Centres up and down the country were already providing the momentum for the practical activities of the British Cycling Federation. Not only has contact been established between many of them but meetings have been held and decisions taken for the setting up of the Divisions which will form the organisational basis of the new Federation. It also said that \\"those who are predisposed to live in the past, and even the progressive League is old enough now to number several such in its ranks\\", would greet the news with surprise. Stallard saw the merger as treason by \\"just three people [who] were allowed the freedom to destroy the BLRC\\"Private letter, June 1989 and until his death saw the new British Cycling Federation (BCF) as a reincarnation of the NCU. In 1989 he wrote: :I have often sat back and thought just how nice it would be if you could relive your life based on the experience gained. For myself, I would never again try to achieve the impossible by trying to change things. On the two occasions I have tried to do this [he tried to introduce age-related racing for riders older than 40], I have failed, not because I lack followers, or because of the opposition of opposing bodies, but because of the activities of anarchists and those who are envious of your success and popularity. Inheritance To the question of whether Britain would have moved to massed racing anyway, without the BLRC, Peter Bryan says not, saying that the established cycling authorities had become entrenched in their positions, their own rivalry overshadowed by their joint fears and interests. :The NCU and the RTTC were never friends. The RTTC were particular bastards and they had so many clever men in the top echelon, many more than the NCU. They were steeped in the tradition of time-trialling and what it stood for and they wouldn't budge a jot or tickle. Stallard's success was that he alerted the UCI to a problem in British cycling which led the UCI to threaten Britain with exclusion from world cycling unless it sorted out the conflict between the NCU and the BLRC. Seeing the BLRC as closer to the UCI's interests, it suggested it would recognise the BLRC and not the NCU as the representative body. It was because of that that the NCU relented and agreed to license the massed races it had hitherto opposed. \\"You can never say that if it didn't happen then this wouldn't have happened, but I can't see what else [other than the BLRC] would have brought it [massed racing] about,\\" said Peter Bryan.

William De Morgan's work was inspired by Middle Eastern and particularly Iznik ceramics which created in vivid blue and green glazes. De Morgan is also credited with the rediscovery in Victorian Britain of the art of lustre glazes. Evelyn De Morgan's art is notable for her rich use of colour and her emphasis on strong female protagonists. The De Morgans were involved in the social issues of the day such as women's suffrage, and this engagement was covered by the museum. The De Morgan Collection includes oil paintings, ceramics, drawings and archive material related to the De Morgans and their circle and it was formed by Evelyn De Morgan's sister, Mrs Wilhelmina Stirling, who wrote several books under the name A. M. W. Stirling. Mrs Stirling provided public access to the collection at her home, Old Battersea House, until her death in 1965. In 1967 the De Morgan Foundation, a registered charity, was formed to care for the collection and parts of it were loaned to a number of locations including Cardiff Castle, Cragside in Northumberland and Knightshayes Court in Devon, all of which have interiors from the years when the De Morgans were active. From 2002 the De Morgan Foundation provided public access to the De Morgan Collection in a dedicated gallery named the De Morgan Centre, which was based in the former West Hill Reference Library in Wandsworth, South West London. The building dates from 1887, which was coincidentally the year in which the De Morgan's were married.http://www.demorgan.org.uk The West Hill Library closed on 28 September 2007 and latterly, the De Morgan Foundation shared the building with Wandsworth Museum. Both the De Morgan Centre and Wandsworth Museum closed to the public on 28 June 2014 due to the discontinuation of their lease by the building's freeholder Wandsworth Council. Since the closure of the De Morgan Centre, the De Morgan Foundation has moved its office to the Watts Gallery at Compton near Guildford in Surrey and continues to care for and exhibit the De Morgan Collection through a series of loans, exhibitions and tours.

It was based on a BBC series called The Sack Race. Two contestants each reported to a new job at separate locations and figure out how to get fired as close to 3:00 p.m. as possible (the store owners are in on the gag, but the managers are not). When both contestants are fired, they report back to host Dave Holmes, and whoever was fired at the right time wins $25,000. Fire Me...Please was believed to be the first reality show to employ a laugh track. The show was also believed to be the first reality series to have one half of an episode feature a repeat, and the other half feature new material. Although critics were not overwhelmed, the series did fairly well in the 18- to 49-year-olds demographic, often placing second against the popular drama House. The show was announced as one of the debut selections on CBS's Innertube website in May 2006, but never appeared on the website. The show's on-air title was Fire Me Please! but CBS insisted the official title was Fire Me...Please. The show is a close adaptation of a short-lived British format, The Sack Race, devised by Hugh Rycroft and first broadcast on BBC Three in 2003, with a repeat run on BBC Two in 2004. (Although the show is often considered to parody the popular series The Apprentice, The Sack Race in fact debuted some months earlier.) The main difference between the two versions is that the UK version was played entirely for laughs, with all of the contestants being young stand-up comedians (including an early appearance by Laura Solon), and no significant prize money at stake - the prize being merely the average daily wage for the job they took on. While The Sack Race was promoted purely as a comedy programme, Fire Me...Please was advertised as a reality television show.

He was a strong critic of both Lieutenant William Bligh and mutiny leader Fletcher Christian, at one time even accusing Bligh of favouring Christian. Despite his anger at Bligh, he did not support the mutiny. Fryer was born at Wells-next-the-Sea, Norfolk. After his naval service, he returned to Wells, and his grave in the churchyard is now clearly identified. In 1787, Fryer was appointed master of HMS Bounty, with Fletcher Christian serving as master's mate. On 10 January 1788, Bligh put his crew on three watches, giving one of them to Christian, and on 2 March, promoted Christian to acting lieutenant. Some have speculated that this was the source of the ill-will that later developed between Fryer and Bligh. However, as a master, Fryer would never have been promoted to lieutenant at sea. Indeed, he never did become a lieutenant. Fryer remained loyal, and accompanied Bligh in reaching Timor. Bligh's account of the mutiny vilified Fryer, but Fryer gave fair evidence at Bligh's court-martial. Edward Christian, Fletcher's brother, was assisted by Fryer in publishing a counterweight to Bligh's version. Fryer never received promotion, but served in the Royal Navy until 1812. Fryer has been portrayed by three actors in various film portrayals of the mutiny on the Bounty. In the 1935 film, he was played by DeWitt Jennings, while Eddie Byrne portrayed him in the 1962 version of Mutiny on the Bounty. Daniel Day-Lewis portrayed him in the 1984 film The Bounty.

Its purpose was to defend cyclists and to organise and regulate bicycle racing in Great Britain. It merged with the Tricycle Association in 1882 and was renamed the National Cyclists' Union in 1883.http://www.warwick.ac.uk/services/library/mrc/ead/328bucol.htm The National Cyclists' Union selected teams for world championships and regulated circuit and track racing in England and Wales. It was a founder member of the International Cycling Association, forerunner of the Union Cycliste Internationale, the world governing body. During and after the Second World War, the NCU became involved in a civil war with a rival body, the British League of Racing Cyclists, which defied the NCU's rules that massed-start races should be held on public roads only when they were closed to other traffic. The struggle between the two lasted for a decade, after which they merged to become the British Cycling Federation. Activities and amateurism The British weekly, The Bicycle, said: :\\"Even during the insecurity of its early years, the union found that it had substantial problems to fight. Foremost among them was a proposed amendment to the Highways Act, then before Parliament, which threatened to check very seriously the use of bicycles on the road. The cyclist of those days was considered a nuisance whether he rode a bicycle, a tricycle, or a velocipede, and was banned by municipal bodies and corporations all over the country. Here was a matter affecting the very existence of cyclists. The Bicycle Union, then barely five months old, was called upon to act promptly. By instant and energetic action a rejection of the venomous amendment was secured.\\"The Bicycle, UK, 17 February 1943, p3 The NCU erected road signs warning cyclists of steep descents and other hazards. It was prompted by a member, J George Jnr, who suggested them in 1878. The idea was taken up by the Earl of Albemarle, who became president of the NCU.http://www.cyclingnorthwales.co.uk/pages/ctc_wing_whls.htm The NCU shared signposting with the Cyclists Touring Club but after 10 years could no longer afford it and the CTC took on the whole job.http://www.cyclingnorthwales.co.uk/pages/ctc_wing_whls.htm The NCU also produced publications to help cyclists tour Britain. It ran racing championships, at first open to anyone in the world. Its championships were the world's most prestigious and considered unofficial championships of the world.Scottish Cyclist, 30 November 1892, p856 The NCU, which had a strict definition of an amateur,McGurn, James (1987), On Your Bicycle, John Murray, London, UK proposed to create an International Cycling Association, open to national organisations whose views of amateurism were similar to its own, and to organise world championships. The International Cycling Union was the forerunner of the Union Cycliste Internationale. The NCU defined amateurism in English races and banned the American sprinter, Arthur Augustus Zimmerman when he appeared to be sponsored by the Raleigh Bicycle Company. It insisted the organisers of the first Bordeaux-Paris met its own idealsThe NCU insisted that amateurs won no prizes in money; the Union V√©locip√®dique de France was happy for amateurs to win up to 200 francs, or what a manual worker earned in 16 months before allowing British riders to take part. When George Pilkington Mills won, the NCU would not recognise the victory, or consider Mills still an amateur, until he proved he had no help from the cycle factory for which he worked.McGurn, James (1987) On Your Bicycle, John Murray (UK) p108 Amateurism and the International Cyclists Association The NCU was a founder member of the world's first cycling authority, the International Cyclists Association. NCU championships, until 1937 open to riders from any country,The Bicycle, UK, 11 November 1942, p4 had been considered the unofficial championships of the world.Scottish Cyclist, 30 November 1892, p856 It was because the sport needed world championships independent of any national body that Henry Sturmey of the magazine The Cyclist and later founder of the Sturmey-Archer gear company proposed an International Cyclists Association in 1892. He approached other countries' cycling national associations through the NCU. The founding meeting was in London in November 1892, with representatives of the NCU and organisations in France, Germany, Holland, Italy and Canada. Not all were the main bodies in their home country. The largest French organisation, the Union V√©locip√®dique Fran√ßaise, sent observers but was not allowed to take part because the NCU had broken off relationships with it over the question of amateurism.McGurn, James (1987), On Your Bicycle, John Murray, London, UK Countries objected to having one vote when Britain, with England, Scotland and Ireland each voting, had three.Cycling, UK, 24 January 1957, p76 France was due to promote the world championships in Paris in 1900. It refused to accept the NCU's position and, after failing to have the issue discussed at an ICA meeting, convened a meeting in Paris to form the Union Cycliste Internationale. Not only would it permit just one team from the United Kingdom but the NCU and Britain's other governing bodies were excluded because they had not been at the founding meeting. It took until 1903 for Britain to be admitted. Road racing The NCU banned all cycle racing on public roads in 1890,http://www.talkcycling.co.uk/guides/cycling_rules.html fearing it would again jeopardise the position of other cyclists. It compelled members to hold their races on velodromes, although the word was not known then, or on closed roads such as in parks and airfields. The only races allowed on public roads were time-trials, in which riders competed against the clock at intervals,Run under the rules of the Road Time Trials Council, formed in 1922 as the Road Racing Council, originally a rebel movement to circumvent the NCU's ban and distance and place-to-place record attempts. Such a ban did not operate in other countries and massed road racing continued as before. That made little difference to the British because the few international events to which they sent riders, notably the Olympic and world championship road races, had been run as individual time trials. It was as a 100-mile [162 km] time-trial, in Shropshire, that Britain organised the world championship road race in 1922. Then in 1933 the UCI decided that championships would be massed-start events. The NCU organised its 1933 world championship trial as a circuit race at Brooklands near Weybridge in Surrey. This and Donington Park in the north Midlands remained the sole venues for massed start racing on mainland Britain until 1942, along with the Snaefell Mountain Course on the neighbouring Isle of Man. The trial led to a series of races at Brooklands, organised by the Charlotteville cycling club under Bill Mills, a professional rider who founded the weekly magazine, The Bicycle. Mills was one of few authorities to whom the NCU could turn for advice on road racing and it was he who wrote the NCU's rules, at the request of the secretary, H. N. Crowe. The wording that Mills chose in 1933 led to the NCU's long civil war with a later rival body, the British League of Racing Cyclists. Mills wrote: \\"No massed start race shall be permitted, other than on an enclosed circuit, unless the course is closed under statute by the competent authority, to other vehicular traffic.\\" Nine years later, in October 1942 and after the BLRC had broken away from the NCU because of that insistence on closed roads, Mills regretted what he had done: \\"In 1933 it was impossible to foresee the future... the war, the changing conditions on the road, the decline of track sport, the growing demand for massed start under real road conditions. My notes covered conditions as they existed in 1933.\\"The Bicycle, UK, 14 October 1942, p4 At the time, said the writer and team manager Chas Messenger, \\"there were thousands riding in time trials and, apart from a once-in-a-while article in the cycling press, they knew little or nothing about road racing.\\"Messenger, Chas (1998), Ride and Be Damned, Pedal Publishing, UK, , p6 The Brooklands races inspired some riders and one, Percy Stallard, took advantage of low wartime traffic in 1942 to organise a race on the open road from Llangollen to Wolverhampton. The NCU banned him sine die - until further notice - and he and others formed the British League of Racing Cyclists as a rival. Rivalry with the BLRC The NCU and the BLRC (British League of Racing Cyclists) remained rivals for 17 years, a position which split British cycling. The BLRC's position was that racing on the road was not illegal, that it did not obstruct other travellers, and that it gave England and WalesScotland was administered by the Scottish Cyclists Union, which had fewer objections the experience to compete internationally. The NCU had entrusted its wartime administration to an emergency committee which did not have power to change major rules. The journalist John Dennis said the NCU still believed that racing on the road threatened all cycling and did not want to make any change while so many members were out of the country, fighting in the war.Journal, Fellowship of Cycling Old-Timers, UK, 2002 The two sides maintained their positions when peace came in 1945 and for many years each banned the members of the other. The rivalry ended in 1959 when the two merged to form the British Cycling Federation.

He is professor of history at Birkbeck College, University of London. Figes is known for his works on Russian history, such as A People's Tragedy (1996), Natasha's Dance (2002), The Whisperers (2007), Crimea (2010) and Just Send Me Word (2012), as well as books on European history, such as The Europeans (2019). A People's Tragedy is a study of the Russian Revolution, and combines social and political history with biographical details in a historical narrative. He serves on the editorial board of the journal Russian History, writes for the international press, broadcasts on television and radio, reviews for The New York Review of Books, and is a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. His books have been translated into over thirty languages Personal life and education Born in Islington, north London, Figes is the son of John George Figes and the feminist writer Eva Figes whose Jewish family fled Nazi Germany in 1939. He attended William Ellis School in north London (1971‚Äì78) and studied History at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, graduating with a double-starred first in 1982. He completed his PhD at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was a fellow and lecturer in history from 1984 to 1999 before he succeeded Richard J. Evans as professor of history at Birkbeck College, University of London. Figes is married to human rights lawyer Stephanie Palmer, a senior lecturer in law at Cambridge University and barrister at Blackstone Chambers London. They have two daughters, Lydia and Alice. He lives in London and is a supporter of Chelsea Football Club. His elder sister was the author and editor Kate Figes. In an interview with Andrew Marr in 1997, Figes described himself as \\"a Labour Party supporter and 'a bit of a Tony Blair man', though he confessed, when it came to the revolution, to being mildly pro-Menshevik.\\" https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/makers-of-their-own-tragedy-1275114.html On 13 February 2017, Figes announced on Twitter that he had become a German citizen \\"bec [sic] I don't want to be a Brexit Brit.\\" He divides his time between his homes in London and Umbria in Italy.https://www.amazon.co.uk/Orlando- Figes/e/B000APO9J8/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1 Writing =Works on the Russian Revolution= Figes's first three books were on the Russian Revolution and the Civil War. Peasant Russia, Civil War (1989) was a detailed study of the peasantry in the Volga region during the Revolution and the Civil War (1917‚Äì21). Using village Soviet archives, Figes emphasised the autonomous nature of the agrarian revolution during 1917‚Äì18, showing how it developed according to traditional peasant notions of social justice independently of the Provisional Government, the Bolsheviks or other urban-based parties.Figes, Orlando, Peasant Russia, Civil War, p. xxi. He also demonstrated how the function of the rural Soviets was transformed in the course of the Civil War as they were taken over by younger and more literate peasants and migrant townsmen, many of them veterans of the First World War or Red Army soldiers, who became the rural bureaucrats of the emerging Bolshevik regime. A People's Tragedy (1996) is a panoramic history of the Revolution from 1891 to the death of Vladimir Lenin in 1924. It combines social and political history and interweaves through the public narrative the personal stories of several representative figures, including Grigory Rasputin, the writer Maxim Gorky, Prince Georgy Lvov and General Alexei Brusilov, as well as unknown peasants and workers. Figes wrote that he had \\"tried to present the revolution not as a march of abstract social forces and ideologies but as a human event of complicated individual tragedies\\".Figes, Orlando, A People's Tragedy, 1996, p. xvii. Left-wing critics have represented Figes as a conservative because of his negative assessment of Lenin and his focus on the individual and \\"the random succession of chance events\\" rather than on the collective actions of the masses.Haynes, Michael, and Wolfreys, Jim, History and Revolution, London: Verso, 2007, p. 15. Others have situated Figes among the so-called 'revisionist' historians of the Revolution who attempted to explain its political development in terms of social history.Keep, John, \\"Great October?\\" in The Times Literary Supplement, 23 August 1996, p. 5. In 2008, the Times Literary Supplement listed A People's Tragedy as one of the \\"hundred most influential books since the war\\".Times Literary Supplement, 30 December 2008. In 2013 David Bowie named A People's Tragedy one of his 'top 100 books'. Interpreting the Russian Revolution: The Language and Symbols of 1917 (1999), co-written with Boris Kolonitskii, analyses the political language, revolutionary songs, visual symbols and historical ideas that animated the revolutionary crowds of 1917.Journal of Cold War Studies, Volume 2, Number 2, Spring 2000, pp. 122‚Äì25. Revolutionary Russia: 1891‚Äì1991, is a short introduction to the subject published as part of the relaunch of Pelican Books in the United Kingdom in 2014. In it Figes argues for the need to see the Russian Revolution in a longer time-frame than most historians have allowed. He states that his aim is 'to chart one hundred years of history as a single revolutionary cycle. In this telling the Revolution starts in the nineteenth century (and more specifically in 1891, when the public‚Äôs reaction to the famine crisis set it for the first time on a collision course with the autocracy) and ends with the collapse of the Soviet regime in 1991.' =Natasha's Dance and Russian cultural history= Published in 2002, Natasha's Dance is a broad cultural history of Russia from the building of St. Petersburg during the reign of Peter the Great in the early eighteenth century. Taking its title from a scene in Tolstoy's War and Peace, where the young countess Natasha Rostova intuitively dances a peasant dance, it explores the tensions between the European and folk elements of Russian culture, and examines how the myth of the \\"Russian soul\\" and the idea of \\"Russianness\\" itself have been expressed by Russian writers, artists, composers and philosophers. Figes is credited as the historical consultant on the 2012 film Anna Karenina. Figes has also written essays on various Russian cultural figures, including Leo Tolstoy, Dmitri Shostakovich, Sergei Prokofiev and Andrei Platonov. In 2003 he wrote and presented a TV feature documentary for the BBC, The Tsar's Last Picture Show, about the pioneering colour photographer in Tsarist Russia Sergei Prokudin-Gorsky. =The Whisperers= His book The Whisperers followed the approach of oral history. In partnership with the Memorial Society, a human rights non-profit, Figes gathered several hundred private family archives from homes across Russia and carried out more than a thousand interviews with survivors as well as perpetrators of the Stalinist repressions. Housed in the Memorial Society in Moscow, St Petersburg and Perm, many of these valuable research materials are available online. Translated into more than twenty languages,His books have been translated into French, German, Dutch, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, Finnish, Russian, Czech, Slovak, Polish, Estonian, Latvian, Slovenian, Serbian, Bulgarian, Greek, Turkish, Hebrew, Georgian, Korean, Japanese and Chinese.[] The Whisperers was described by Andrey Kurkov as \\"one of the best literary monuments to the Soviet people\\" In it Figes underlined the importance of oral testimonies for the recovery of the history of repression in the former Soviet Union. While conceding that, \\"like all memory, the testimony given in an interview is unreliable\\", he said that oral testimony \\"can be cross-examined and tested against other evidence\\".The Whisperers (London, 2007), p. 636. The Whisperers deals mainly with the impact of repression on the private life. It examines the influence of the Soviet regime and its campaigns of Terror on family relationships, emotions and beliefs, moral choices, issues of personal and social identity, and collective memory. According to Figes, 'the real power and lasting legacy of the Stalinist system were neither in structures of the state, nor in the cult of the leader, but, as the Russian historian Mikhail Gefter once remarked, \\"in the Stalinism that entered into all of us\\".'Figes, The Whisperers, p. xxxii. The Whisperers includes a detailed study of the Soviet writer Konstantin Simonov, who became a leading figure in the Soviet Writers' Union and a propagandist in the \\"anti-cosmopolitan\\" campaign during Stalin's final years. Figes drew on the closed sections of Simonov's archive in the Russian State Archive of Literature and Art and on the archives of the poet's wife and son to produce his study of this major Soviet establishment figure.Times Literary Supplement, 8 February 2008. =Just Send Me Word= Published in 2012, Just Send Me Word is a true story based on 1,246 letters smuggled in and out of the Pechora labour camp between 1946 and 1955 between Lev Mishchenko (a prisoner) and Svetlana Ivanova (his girlfriend in Moscow). There are 647 letters from Lev to Svetlana, and 599 from her to him. They form part of a family archive discovered by the Memorial Society and delivered in three trunks to their Moscow offices in 2007. The letters are the largest known collection of private correspondence from the Gulag, according to Memorial.\\"A Note From Memorial\\" in Just Send Me Word, p. 297. Figes was given exclusive access to the letters and other parts of the archive, which is also based on interviews with the couple when they were in their nineties, and the archives of the labour camp itself. Figes raised the finance for the transcription of the letters, which are housed in the Memorial Society in Moscow and will become available to researchers in 2013. According to Figes, \\"Lev's letters are the only major real-time record of daily life in the Gulag that has ever come to light.\\" The book tells the story of Lev and Svetlana who met as students in the Physics Faculty of Moscow University in 1935. Separated by the Second World War in 1941, when Lev was enrolled in the Red Army, they made contact in 1946, when he wrote from Pechora. Figes uses the letters to explore conditions in the labour camp and to tell the love story, ending in 1955 with Lev's release and marriage to Svetlana. The book documents five illegal trips made by Svetlana to visit Lev by smuggling herself into the labour camp. The title of the book is taken from the poem \\"In Dream\\" by Anna Akhmatova, translated by D.M. Thomas: \\"Black and enduring separation/I share equally with you/Why weep? Give me your hand/Promise to appear in a dream again./You and I are like two mountains/And in this world we cannot meet./Just send me word/At midnight sometime through the stars.\\" Writing in the Financial Times, Simon Sebag Montefiore called Just Send Me Word \\"a unique contribution to Gulag scholarship as well as a study of the universal power of love\\". Several reviewers highlighted the book's literary qualities, pointing out that it 'reads like a novel' Just Send Me Word has been translated into German, French, Italian,Spanish, Dutch, Polish, Swedish, Portuguese, Norwegian, Finnish, Danish, Japanese, Korean and Chinese. =Crimea= Crimea: The Last Crusade is a panoramic history of the Crimean War of 1853‚Äì56. Drawing extensively from Russian, French and Ottoman as well as British archives, it combines military, diplomatic, political and cultural history, examining how the war left a lasting mark on the national consciousness of Britain, France, Russia and Turkey. Figes sets the war in the context of the Eastern Question, the diplomatic and political problems caused by the decay of the Ottoman Empire. In particular, he emphasises the importance of the religious struggle between Russia as the defender of the Orthodox and France as the protector of the Catholics in the Ottoman Empire. He frames the war within a longer history of religious conflict between Christians and Muslims in the Balkans, southern Russia and the Caucasus that continues to this day. Figes stresses the religious motive of the Tsar Nicholas I in his bold decision to go to war, arguing that Nicholas was swayed by the ideas of the Pan-Slavs to invade Moldavia and Wallachia and encourage Slav revolts against the Ottomans, despite his earlier adherence to the Legitimist principles of the Holy Alliance. He also shows how France and Britain were drawn into the war by popular ideas of Russophobia that swept across Europe in the wake of the Revolutions of 1830 and 1848. As one reviewer wrote, Figes shows \\"how the cold war of the Soviet era froze over fundamental fault lines that had opened up in the 19th century.\\" = The Europeans = The Europeans: Three Lives and the Making of a Cosmopolitan Culture is a panoramic history of nineteenth-century European culture told through the biographies of Pauline Viardot, the opera singer, composer and salon hostess, her husband Louis Viardot, an art expert and theatre manager, and the Russian writer Ivan Turgenev, who had a long love affair with Pauline Viardot and lived with the couple in a m√©nage √† trois for over twenty years. They lived at various times in Paris, Baden-Baden, London, Courtavenel and Bougival. Figes argues that a pan-European culture formed through new technologies (especially the railways and lithographic printing), mass foreign travel, market forces, and the development of international copyright, enabling writers, artists and composers as well as their publishers to enter foreign markets through the growth of literary translations, touring companies and international publishing. In the continent as a whole, the arts thus became \\"a unifying force between nations\\" leading to the emergence of a modern European 'canon' so that, by 1900, \\"the same books were being read across the Continent, the same paintings reproduced, the same music played at home or heard in concert halls, and the same operas performed in all the major theatres of Europe\\". The Europeans was published in the United Kingdom in September 2019. Writing in The Guardian, William Boyd described it as 'magisterial, beguiling, searching, a history of a continent in constant change'. In The Telegraph Rupert Christiansen described it as 'timely, brilliant and hugely enjoyable - a magnificently humane book, written with supple grace but firmly underpinned by meticulous scholarship.' Views on Russian politics Figes has been critical of the Vladimir Putin government, in particular allegations that Putin has attempted to rehabilitate Joseph Stalin and impose his own agenda on history-teaching in Russian schools and universities. He is involved in an international summer school for history teachers in Russian universities organised by the European University of St Petersburg. On 4 December 2008, the St Petersburg offices of the Memorial Society were raided by the police. The entire electronic archive of Memorial in St Petersburg, including the materials collected with Figes for The Whisperers, was confiscated by the authorities. Figes condemned the police raid, accusing the Russian authorities of trying to rehabilitate the Stalinist regime. Figes organised an open protest letter to President Dmitry Medvedev and other Russian leaders, which was signed by several hundred leading academics from across the world. After several court hearings, the materials were finally returned to Memorial in May 2009. Figes has also condemned the arrest by the FSB of historian Mikhail Suprun as part of a \\"Putinite campaign against freedom of historical research and expression\\". In December 2013, Figes wrote a long piece in the US journal Foreign Affairs on the Euromaidan demonstrations in Kiev suggesting that a referendum on Ukraine's foreign policy and the country's possible partition might be a preferable alternative to the possibility of civil war and military intervention by Russia. Film and television work Figes has contributed frequently to radio and television broadcasts in the United Kingdom and around the world. In 1999 he wrote a six- part educational TV series on the history of Communism under the title Red Chapters. Produced by Opus Television and broadcast in the UK, the 25-minute films featured turning-points in the history of Soviet Russia, China, and Cuba. In 2003 he wrote and presented a TV feature documentary for the BBC, The Tsar's Last Picture Show, about the pioneering colour photographer in Russia Sergei Prokudin-Gorsky. In 2007 he wrote and presented two 60-minute Archive Hour programmes on radio entitled Stalin's Silent People which used recordings from his oral history project with Memorial that formed the basis of his book The Whisperers. The programmes are available on Figes's website. Figes was the historical consultant on the film Anna Karenina (2012), directed by Joe Wright, starring Keira Knightley and Jude Law with a screenplay by Tom Stoppard. He was also credited as the historical consultant on the 2016 BBC War & Peace television series directed by Tom Harper with a screenplay by Andrew Davies. Interviewed by the Sunday Telegraph, Figes defended the series against criticism that it was \\"too Jane Austen\\" and \\"too English\\". Theatrical adaptations Figes' The Whisperers was adapted and performed by Rupert Wickham as Stalin's Favourite. Based on Figes' portrayal of the writer Konstantin Simonov, the play was performed in the National Theatre in London followed by a season of performances at the Unicorn Theatre in London. Controversy over Amazon reviews In 2010, Figes posted several pseudonymous reviews on the UK site of the online bookseller Amazon where he criticised books by two other British historians of Russia, Robert Service and Rachel Polonsky, whilst praising his own books, among others. Initially denying responsibility for the reviews, he threatened legal action against those who suggested he was their author.Alexandra Topping, \\"Historian Orlando Figes agrees to pay damages for fake reviews\\",The Guardian, 16 July 2010. Figes' lawyer later issued a statement that Figes' wife had written the reviews, but in a further statement Figes admitted \\"full responsibility\\" for the reviews himself, agreeing to pay legal costs and damages to Polonsky and Service, who sued him for libel. Prizes A People's Tragedy was awarded the Wolfson History Prize, the WH Smith Literary Award, the NCR Book Award, the Longman- History Today Book Prize, and the Los Angeles Times Book Prize. Natasha's Dance and The Whisperers were both short-listed for the Samuel Johnson Prize, making Figes the only writer to have been short-listed twice for this prize.

Bo Jonsson (Grip) (early 1330s - 20 August 1386) was head of the royal council and marshal under the regency of Magnus IV of Sweden. Also in the council was his friend and colleague, Karl Ulfsson av Ulv√•sa, eldest son of Saint Birgitta. From 1369, during Albert of Sweden‚Äôs reign, he was Officialis Generalis (the king's highest official) and from 1371 Lord High Steward (drots in Swedish).Emilsson, Erik √ñrjan (2005).Before 'The European Miracles'. Four Essays on Swedish Preconditions for Conquest, Growth and Voice . Doctoral Dissertation at the Department of Economic History, G√∂teborg University. Publication no 93, 2005. , p. 20. Bo Jonsson dominated the political life of Sweden and Finland for decades. He was the most influential representative to the council of aristocracy that deposed Magnus IV of Sweden in 1365 and installed Albrecht von Mecklenburg on the Swedish throne. His position as the new king's Officialis Generalis granted him vast fiscal and administrative control. By 1374, he had gained title to all of Finland.Finland. (2007). In Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. Retrieved 29 May 2007. The family name, Grip ‚àí which Bo Jonsson himself never used ‚àí is Swedish for Griffin. A coat of arms showing a black griffin on a gold shield, attributed to Bo Jonsson, was later adopted as the coat of arms of S√∂dermanland. The original family arms, however, may have been Argent, a griffin's head sable, traced back to Tomas Jonsson (Grip) from around 1299. Jan Ranecke, Svenska medeltidsvapen Advancement Through inheritance and unprejudiced methods, Bo Jonsson came to control the largest private non-royal wealth Sweden has ever seen. He usurped 1,500 farms in 350 parishes throughout Sweden, from Kalmar to Falun, through economic and political means. He became Sweden's (and Finland's) largest landowner ever. The quantity of land under his control exceeded 1/3 of the entirety of the Swedish realm,Kalmar L√§nsmuseum (1996). Bo Jonsson Grip . Medieval history at the Museum, Kalmar L√§n. In Swedish. Retrieved 29 May 2007. surpassing even the ruling king's national land holdings. In 1363 he was the leader of an aristocratic rebellion. He solicited support from Albert II, Duke of Mecklenburg and in 1365, he became instrumental in removing Magnus Eriksson from the Swedish throne and offering it to the Duke's son. Authority From the Gripsholm Castle in Mariefred, which he built,Gripsholm Castle . History. The Royal Court of Sweden. Retrieved 29 May 2007. Bo Jonsson governed the entire valley of Lake M√§laren, H√§lsingland, all of Finland, large parts of V√§sterg√∂tland, Eastern √ñsterg√∂tland, and the Sm√•land coast, including the city of Kalmar. He secured the Finnish fiefs as a reward for having assisted Albert to the throne of Sweden.Kirby, David (2006). A Concise History of Finland. Cambridge University Press, 2006. , p. 10. Excerpt: A medieval marchland. Retrieved 29 May 2007. He controlled a dozen fortresses, among which were Finnish √Öbo Castle, Tavastehus and Viborg, Swedish Kalmar Castle and Nyk√∂ping Castle, in addition to ones built under his own direction: Bj√§rkaholm, Ringstaholm, and his most prized holding, Gripsholm. As the head of the governing council and through his personal usurpation of large areas of the country, Bo Jonsson indirectly curtailed the concentration of royal power as well as German and Danish influence. However, he also solicited foreign intervention from Denmark and Mecklenburg in order to install the nobility party's puppet kings on the Swedish throne. Marriage Bo Jonsson married twice during his life. His first marriage took place with the wealthy Margareta Porse, who died shortly thereafter while undergoing childbirth. He allowed the baby to be delivered via Caesarean section, though it died but one day later. His second wife was the beautiful German Margareta Dume, who had many admirers. One of her many suitors was Karl Nilsson, a nobleman from S√∂dermanland. Karl Nilsson was stabbed in front of the high altar at the church of the Greyfriars (Franciscans), nowadays known as Riddarholmskyrkan, in Stockholm, Sweden. Contemporary sources held Bo Jonsson to be guilty, acting in a jealous rage, but he maintained his innocence in witnessed testimonies, swearing his presence to have been elsewhere. Due to his powerful position, he was never charged.Blev en riddare m√∂rdad och begravd i Riddarholmskyrkan? Svar om stockholmiana. Dagens Nyheter, 2 September 2003. (Q&A; with DN's specialist Martin Stugart). In Swedish. Retrieved 29 May 2007. Nine days later, the estate formerly belonging to Karl Nilsson fell into the hands of Jonsson. Death Bo Jonsson died 20 August 1386 and donated in his will a substantial part of his wealth to monasteries and churches in Sweden. In particular he gave aid to the monastery in Vadstena, operated by the Bridgittine Order and dedicated to Saint Birgitta whom Bo Jonsson had dedicated a big part of his life to get canonized. To ensure that the rest of his possessions would not fall into the hands of king Albert of Sweden whom he did not hold in very high regard he appointed a council of lords who would govern them in his name. The struggle between the king and this council concerning the huge estates he left behind would eventually lead to the Kalmar Union. Progeny Bo Jonsson's first wife, who died at childbirth, bore him a son Jon Bosson, who died the same day. With his second wife Margreta Lambrektsdotter (Dume), he had at least two children, history tells about his son Knut Bosson (Grip) who was once castellan of Turku castle, and daughter Margareta Bosdotter who married Detler Bylow. The second marriage possibly produced other daughters too, but they are unnamed in historical sources. He was influential in the expansion of the medieval Finnish economy and his descendants were created barons in 1561 (see Grip av Vin√§s). References Further reading *Engstr√∂m, Sten (1935).

Career After playing an initial 1967 Trinity College gig with guitarist Humphrey Weightman, and some 1968 gigs with keyboard player/vocalist Brian Trench, Booth and Pawle teamed up with multi-instrumentalist Tim Goulding (born 15 May 1945, Hatch Street, Dublin), vocals, recorder and keyboards, at that time an aspiring painter. Goulding and Pawle were living and rehearsing in a Lower Mount Street house rented by Goulding's girlfriend, \\"Orphan Annie\\" Mohan, which its tenants nicknamed \\"The Orphanage\\". Tim Booth later lived in a second Orphanage in Sandymount, Dublin. The two Orphanages became a springboard for a new generation of Irish rock, helping launch the careers of Thin Lizzy's Phil Lynott, Gary Moore and others. Percussionist/vocalist Caroline \\"Linus\\" Greville joined the band for two brief periods in 1968 and 1969. After signing with the Incredible String Band's producer and manager Joe Boyd, Dr Strangely Strange debuted in 1969 with Kip of the Serenes. The album was produced by Boyd. Later in the year Pawle guested on the Incredible String Band's Changing Horses album. Linus was asked to leave to cut down on touring costs at the end of 1969, after some early recording sessions for the next LP. The band became popular on the UK college circuit, playing support slots the length and breadth of the UK. Their second album, Heavy Petting, was released in September 1970 and featured Gary Moore on lead guitar, with Dave Mattacks on drums. In summer 1970, at a Burton-on-Trent concert, they enlisted drummer Neil Hopwood. Goulding left at the start of 1971 to briefly study Buddhism at Samye Ling monastery and then work on his painting career. Pawle and Booth teamed with Gay Woods and Terry Woods for a six-week European tour, but Dr Strangely Strange began falling apart. The group disbanded in May 1971, after playing a concert with Al Stewart at London's Drury Lane Theatre. Booth and Pawle felt the combination was not working, and there were tensions in the band. The Woods explained: \\"We said that if the Strangelies hadn't gotten it together during the time we were on the Continent then we would leave, because six weeks of gigging should pull a band tighter. Unfortunately, instead of getting together, they were getting looser\\".'Woods Band, Living Their Tradition' in Sounds, Spotlight Publications, 28 August 1971, p. 12 Reunions The original band reunited in 1972 for an Irish tour, and briefly reconvened in the early 1980s. During this time Goulding worked as an artist, Booth became a graphic designer and made animated films and Pawle ran a laundrette. In October 1994, the band played at the Griffin Hotel in Leeds as part of an Incredible String Band convention weekend. The band reformed, with the original trio plus fiddle/mandolin player Joe Thoma, to record a third album in 1996. Gary Moore guested again. On 16 June 2007, the four-piece band regrouped for a Bloomsday concert at London‚Äôs 12 Bar Club to mark the launch of the archive collection Halcyon Days. This was followed by a special homecoming gig in the Sugar Club on Leeson Street, Dublin, Ireland on 1 March 2008. In February 2009, Hux Records reissued Kip of the Serenes as a Collectors' Edition with four bonus tracks. On 19 July 2009, the band participated in the Witchseason Weekender (featuring artists from Joe Boyd's Witchseason Productions company) at The Barbican, London. They performed a free concert on the foyer stage and then participated in the full Sunday evening concert entitled The Music of the Incredible String Band.

It is located approximately halfway between and stations, at the point where the Maesteg Line diverges from the South Wales Main Line; it is also the western terminus of the Vale of Glamorgan Line from Cardiff. It is measured from London Paddington. It is the fifth-busiest station in Wales, after Cardiff Central, , Newport and Swansea. History View from the east end of platforms 2 and 3 in 1962 The station was opened on 18 June 1850, and both the main platform building and the 1877 pedestrian bridge are Grade II listed. The station was designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel. Services on both branch lines from the station were withdrawn for a time in the 1960s & early 1970s (trains on the Vale of Glamorgan line fell victim to the Beeching cuts in June 1964, whilst Maesteg trains were withdrawn in July 1970), but because the lines remained in-situ due to coal traffic for the Aberthaw Power Station, each one has since been reopened to passenger services. Platform 3 was a full length platform running east-to-west until the 1970s when it was removed following the closure of the Maesteg line to passenger traffic. The cafe/waiting area of platform 2 now occupies land where the track used to sit. Platform 1A was opened in June 2005 by Andrew Davies to act as the terminus for the newly re-opened Vale of Glamorgan Line, with trains now running through to and from Aberdare. A second, and fully accessible footbridge, was built in 2012 at a cost of ¬£2.4m and the main station ticket hall and entrance was refurbished in 2018 at a cost of ¬£1.5million. Facilities New fully accessible footbridge which was built in 2012 The station is fully staffed throughout the week, with the ticket office on platform 1 open from early morning until mid-evening. A self-service ticket machine is also provided for use and for the collection of pre-paid tickets. There is a waiting room and photo booth in the main building on platform 1, whist the amenities on platform 2 include toilets and a coffee shop. Train running details are offered via CIS displays, automatic announcements and timetable posters. Step-free access is available to all platforms via lifts in the accessible footbridge at the eastern end.Bridgend station facilities National Rail Enquiries Services GWR service to London Passenger services are operated by Great Western Railway to and from London Paddington and Swansea, with some services extended to Carmarthen; and by Transport for Wales to destinations across Wales. To the west, Transport for Wales trains run along the South Wales Main Line and West Wales Line to Swansea and then to Carmarthen, Pembroke Dock, Milford Haven or Fishguard Harbour. Mainline services to Swansea and London run hourly (with extra services at peak hours), whilst the regional trains to Manchester Piccadilly via and local trains to and over the Vale of Glamorgan Line also run hourly; the Swanline local stopping trains to/from Swansea run every two hours.

Accidents and incidents  *In December 1965 a fatal collision occurred with a derailed Class 47, D1671, and D6983 travelling to Swansea, as the result of a landslip. The damage was so severe, D6983 was the first EE Type 3 to be withdrawn and as a result, the only locomotive in the entire class not to receive a TOPS number. The wreckage blocked the South Wales mainline and the Vale of Glamorgan line. Trains had to be diverted via the Vale of Neath line until unluckily a landslip blocked that route also. After the lines reopened, the remains of both locomotives were sold to local scrap merchants R.S.

The O's album was finally finished in 2005 when Pelle Gunnerfeldt (producer of The Hives) was brought in for additional production and mixes, bringing in Per Nordmark on drums and Bjorn Ytlling (of Peter Bjorn & John) for additional keyboards. The self- financed album was licensed initially to Virgin/EMI Sweden in May 2005 for Scandinavian release only. In September 2005, the imported debut was Album Of The Week in London record store Rough Trade who described it as \\"...a fantastic album of ‚ÄòEuropean cool‚Äô with breathy vocals over music which sounds like The Concretes, Stereolab or a modern take on the Velvet Underground‚Ä¶\\" and in 2006 the band released La Ballade on their own Rushmore Recordings label headed up by ex Warner Bros A&R; executive and Deaf School founder member Steve Allen. By Summer 2007, it was available physically in France, Japan, Thailand, Portugal, Finland, Norway, Denmark, and Sweden, as well as digitally distributed. Reception La Ballade received great critical acclaim. In France, the influential rock critic Nicolas Ungemuth reviewed it favourably for Le Figaro and the magazine Rock & Folk. The band also received rave reviews from the other leading French music writers at Les Inrockuptibles, Magic, and Rolling Stone. The album received a year-in-review award from Le Figaro. =2007 onwards= *In 2006, Vanessa Quinones was the guest vocalist on Scott Walker's album The Drift.

The album follows the duo's 1996 performance at the Royal Albert Hall in London, a performance which raised their profile. A live album of the performance was released as Live at the Royal Albert Hall in August, becoming the band's best selling album. The duo followed the success with Dark Fields. Recorded in St Merryn, Dark Fields features Knightley's characteristic West Country-focused lyrics and a \\"live\\" sound carried over from their previous studio release Lie of the Land (1995). The album was released in May 1997, received positive reviews from critics. The band also released a single from the album, \\"Crazy Boy\\", which was the band's first single. Background With their 1995 album Lie of the Land, Devon-based folk duo Show of Hands, consisting of Steve Knightley and Phil Beer, found the most success in their career so far. Whilst that album's predecessor, Beat about the Bush (1994), aimed for radio play by incorporating a full band set up,Roots: The Best of Show of Hands liner notes it did not receive the air play wanted. The duo then sought for a stripped down, more acoustic sound for Lie of the Land which felt more like the duo's live performances. The album was released in 1995 on Isis Records, and unlike their previous album, it found attention from major publications, such as Mojo and Q, with the latter subsequently naming it the \\"folk album of the year\\".Show of Hands - feature article in the Living Tradition magazine The duo received more attention and, by early 1996, they had by now built up a considerable fanbase through their mailing list.Show Of Hands Biography  OLDIES.com Knightley, Beer and manager O‚ÄôFarrell, who had produced Lie of the Land, took the gamble of hiring London's Royal Albert Hall for a performance on the evening of 24 March 1996, in attempt to gather all of the duo's fans, and to raise the duo's profile. Whilst a certainly ambitious idea, the duo hired the hall \\"to the amusement of the media and the cynicism of sceptics\\" and was considered a huge gamble. Nonetheless, the performance sold out in advance. Selling out the hall was unprecedented for a folk act.Preview: Show of Hands, The Sage Gateshead - Chronicle Live One biography said that the success \\"proved that for this enigmatic, indy duo anything was possible.\\" Knightley said in 1997 that \\"people still talk about it in glowing terms.\\" He also noted that \\"quite a lot of people now know Show Of Hands as 'Those guys who did the Albert Hall'. So it's opened a lot of doors. In India there was a tremendous cachet - we were checked out by people who came to see us just because of having played the Royal Albert Hall. In America as well. So it exceeded all our expectations in that sense.\\" O'Farrell commenced producing the performance as a live album, whose production work on Lie of the Land pleased the duo, who also liked the live sound of their previous live album Show of Hands Live, produced by Mike Trim. The album cost ¬£200 on the night to record. The live album was released in August 1996 as Live at the Royal Albert Hall, which became the duo's best-selling album. With this new tinge of success that the strength of the Albert Hall built open, Knightley noted that \\"it's easier to get in local papers. But we now need to replace that with a story about the music. That's the dilemma.\\" With this in mind, the duo decide it was time \\"for a new studio recording\\".,Roots: The Best of Show of Hands liner notes and the duo began work on their sixth album, Dark Fields in 1997. Music and lyrics A map of locations in Wessex. Wessex is the subject matter of the album's \\"Wessex Medley\\". The duo co-produced Dark Fields with manager Steve O'Farrell who produced Lie of the Land and Live at the Royal Albert Hall, and recorded it at Joe Partridge's Airfield studios in St Merryn, Cornwall, with the studio commencing recording here due to Knightley's pleasant experience when working on a Mike Silver album at the studio several years prior. Knightley later commented that, \\"wonderfully equipped and utterly secluded, [the duo] locked themselves away for a week or so\\" to record the album. One reviewer noted that \\"the majority of the subjects [on the album] peopling \\"Dark Fields\\" exude Englishness. On one hand there are the misfits - hedonistic teenager, dyed-in-the-wool poacher. Another hand highlights slave traders or recruiting sergeants - murky historical characters trapped by their time. On the third hand, the West Country's exiled miners and heroic emergency servants are given the benefit of Knightley's sympathetic pen. And on the final hand, leavening the proceedings, there are a brace of unrequited love- stories and a terrifyingly competent tune set.\\"Living Tradition CD review of Show Of Hands - Dark Fields Knightley noted in 2007 that the album's production was generally based on the duo's live sound, despite being \\"more rounded\\", and also noted that \\"many of the songs on this album are still concert standards\\". \\"Cousin Jack\\", the opening track, remains one of the duo's best known and most performed songs. The song is about the Cornish miners of the Cornish diaspora. Many Cornish people were known as \\"Cousin Jacks\\". The fourth track is a \\"Wessex Medley\\". The twelfth track, \\"High Germany/Molly Oxford\\", was recorded live at Norwich in spring 1997. It is the first time the duo included a live performance on a studio album. Over half of the tracks on the album are Steve Knightley compositions, the others traditional pieces arranged by the duo, other than a cover version of Bob Dylan's \\"Farewell Angelina\\" and Nic Jones' arrangement of \\"Warlike Lads of Russia\\", a track described by one reviewer as \\"just the kind of blatant altruism which Zimmerman of Hibbing notably omitted to display a few years back.\\" \\"The Bristol Slaver\\" is about the Bristol slave trade and \\"Crazy Boy\\" is about a \\"bored teenager\\", whilst \\"Longdog\\" is about poachers and \\"The Shout\\" is about voluntary emergency services. The album features numerous guest musicians. Chris While, of Beer's former band The Albion Band, sings vocals on the song \\"Dark Fields\\". Matt Clifford also plays keyboards on that track and three others.Liner notes For the \\"Wessex Medley\\", a medley that first consists of Beer's composition \\"Carrick Roads\\", then \\"Plum Pudding\\", a traditional piece arranged by Knightley and Beer, and finally Beer's \\"The Rocky Road to Chudleigh\\", melodeon was provided by Simon Care. The seventh song, \\"Flora\\", features percussion by Joe Partridge and backing vocals from Lucy Watkins, Richard Hammond and Paul Banham who also sing backing vocals on \\"The Shout\\". The live track, \\"High Germany\\"/\\"Molly Oxford\\", features vocals from Kate Rusby, fiddle from Chris Wood and melodeon from Andy Cutting.Liner notes. Of the duo, Steve Knightley sings all lead vocals, as well as playing guitar, cuatro, mandocello, concertina, acoustic bass guitar and mandolin on the album. Meanwhile, Phil Beer sings other vocals and plays guitars, mandolin, fiddle, cuatro, viola and mandocello. This album marks the first two appearances of the song \\"The Train\\" on a Show of Hands studio album. Firstly appearing as the album's sixth track, it is featured again in the form of a ten-minute reprise as a hidden track following ten minutes of silence after \\"High Germany\\" / \\"Molly Oxford\\", the last track on the album. It is the first of three hidden tracks by the duo. The band's following album, Folk music features a new combination of the song with \\"Blackwaterside\\". The band's 2002 live album, Cold Cuts features another new combination of the song with \\"Sit You Down\\". The band's 2005 live album, As You Were features a new medley which features \\"The Train\\" followed by \\"Santiago\\" and \\"The Soldier's Joy\\". Release and reception To try and build on the duo's success, and to promote Dark Fields, the duo agreed to release their first single, choosing the album's eighth track \\"Crazy Boy\\", backed with the B-sides \\"The Train Trilogy\\" and \\"Crow on the Cradle\\".Show Of Hands (3) - Crazy Boy (CD) at Discogs In a 1997 interview, Steve Knightley said \\"for now we're putting out the present single 'Crazy Boy' to see if we can get an Indie Chart placing or whatever - radio, TV. Maybe that will be the next story, the guys who sold 8,000 singles, or the guys who got to number 50. Whatever. That's the idea for this Autumn.\\" Despite the ambitions, the single failed to chart on the UK Singles Chart. The band would not release any more singles until \\"Are We Alright\\"/\\"Crooked River\\" in 2004. This excludes the music video produced for 2003's \\"Country Life\\", taken from the album of the same name. Although the \\"Crazy Boy\\" single was released in Autumn 1997, Dark Fields was released several months later in December 1997. It was the first time the duo released a studio album anew on their label Hands on Music, who, prior to the release of Dark Fields, had re- released Lie of the Land and released the live album, as well as 1995 compilation album Backlog 1987‚Äì1991. Dark Fields was released as a digipak, their first album to do so. This package pleased reviewer Alan Rose. The album cover, which features a silhouette of a wicker man burning in front of a dark sky, was decided by the duo's long time sleeve designer Rob O'Connor and was described by Knightley in 2007 as being \\"striking\\". The lyric booklet refers to itself as the Dark Fields Song Book.Dark Fields liner notes. Dark Fields was released to positive reviews; Alan Rose of The Living Tradition published a positive review for the album, praising the record and highlighting \\"The Warlkine Lads of Russia\\" as \\"rightly honoured\\" and calling the tune set of the album \\"terrifyingly competent.\\". Dake Tuxford of the same publication, in a review for a subsequent album, described Dark Fields as a \\"winning mix of Knightley's own well-crafted songs, carefully-selected material from the best contemporary songwriters and traditional material,\\" and referring to the record as a \\"polished\\" album \\"whose 'thoughtful lyricism and mood shifts' impressed even the hard-boiled Daily Telegraph reviewer.\\"Living Tradition CD review of Show Of Hands - Covers The duo toured in promotion of the album, and footage from the tour featured on the duo's 1998 documentary/concert film Stairway to Devon, released on VHS by Hands on Music. The film is self- described as \\"world music from the West Country\\". The duo would not release a studio album of new songs until Cold Frontier in September 2001. In the intervening time they recorded an album of traditional songs, Folk Music in September 1998, and an album of cover versions of songs, Covers (2000). \\"Wessex Medley\\" from Dark Fields was included on the various artists compilation album A Celebration of English Folk (2008).Various - A Celebration Of Great British Folk (CD) at Discogs Track listing Tracks written by Steve Knightley, except where noted. #\\"Cousin Jack\\" ‚Äì 5:09 #\\"Longdog\\" ‚Äì 2:45 #\\"The Shout\\" ‚Äì 4:00 #\\"Wessex Medley\\": \\"Carrick Roads\\" (Phil Beer) / \\"Plum Pudding\\" (Trad arr.

A unit interval (UI) is the time taken in a data stream by each subsequent pulse (or symbol). When UI is used as a measurement unit of a time interval, the resulting measure of such time interval is dimensionless. It expresses the time interval in terms of UI. Very often, but not always, the UI coincides with the bit time, i.e. with the time interval taken to transmit one bit (binary information digit). The two coincide in fact in NRZ transmission; they do not coincide in a 2B1Q transmission, where one pulse takes the time of two bits. For example, in a serial line with a baud rate of 2.5 Gbit/s, a unit interval is 1/(2.5 Gbit/s) = 0.4 ns/baud. Jitter measurement Jitter is often measured as a fraction of UI. For example, jitter of 0.01 UI is jitter that moves a signal edge by 1% of the UI duration. The widespread use of UI in jitter measurements comes from the need to apply the same requirements or results to cases of different symbol rates. This can be done when the phenomena investigated are not independent from the symbol duration time but closely related to it. For example, UI is used to measure timing jitter in serial communications or in on-chip clock distributions. This measurement unit is extensively used in jitter literature.

Ettingshausen and his PhD student Walther Nernst were studying the Hall effect in bismuth, and noticed an unexpected perpendicular current flow when one side of the sample was heated. This is also known as the Nernst effect. Conversely, when applying a current (along the y-axis) and a perpendicular magnetic field (along the z-axis) a temperature gradient appears along the x-axis. Because of the Hall effect, electrons are forced to move perpendicular to the applied current. Due to the accumulation of electrons on one side of the sample, the number of collisions increases and a heating of the material occurs. This effect is quantified by the Ettingshausen coefficient P, which is defined as: ::P=\\\\frac{dT/dx}{B_z\\\\cdot J_y} where dT/dx is the temperature gradient that results from the y-component Jy of an electric current density and the z-component Bz of a magnetic field. temperature gradient due to Ettingshausen effect with applied magnetic field and electric current In most metals like copper, silver and gold P is on the order of and thus difficult to observe in common magnetic fields.

Knowledge of this part is assessed through the written assignment. * Part 2: Detailed study (SL: 2 works, 40 hours; HL: 3 works, 65 hours) - This section of the course focuses on the detailed analysis of the works in terms of both content and technique of writing. This part aims to encourage close reading and in-depth analysis of significant elements in each work. Works are chosen from the prescribed list of authors (PLA) and are of different literary genres and different authors (at HL one of the works must be poetry). Knowledge of this part is assessed through the individual oral commentary. * Part 3: Literary genres (SL: 3 works, 40 hours; HL: 4 works, 65 hours) - Works in this part are chosen from the same literary genres from the PLA. The purpose of this is to allow a framework for the comparative study of the chosen works through exploring the literary conventions and features associated with the genre. Knowledge of this part is assessed in paper 2. * Part 4: Options (SL: 3 works, 30 hours; HL: 3 works, 45 hours) - Works for this part are freely chosen by the teacher and can be in any combination, hence its name. Students are assessed on their literary understanding of the works in this part, as well as the ability to produce an effective oral presentation. In total, SL students study 10 works and HL students study 13 works. = Assessment = For all languages at both SL and HL there are five assessment components.  External assessment  * Paper 1: Guided literary analysis (SL: 1 hour 30 minutes)/Literary commentary (HL: 2 hours) (20 marks weighing 20% of the course) - Candidates write a commentary on one of the two unseen passages - a prose and a poetry. SL candidates must respond to the two guiding questions given in the question paper - one on understanding and interpretation and another on style. HL candidates are assessed for their exploration of the various literary aspects and how their effects are achieved. * Paper 2: Essay (25 marks weighing 25% of the course, 1 hour and 30 minutes for SL, 2 hours for HL) - Candidates write a comparative essay based on one of the three essay questions given for the literary genre studied in part 3 of the course. Responses must be based on at least two works from this part, but reference can be made from one of the works studied in part 2 as well. Candidates will not have access to the works studied. * Written assignment (25 marks weighing 25% of the course) - Candidates submit a 1200 to 1500-word analytical literary essay on a topic generated by the candidate, based on a work studied in part 1. This is done in 4 stages - the interactive oral (journal writing for self-taught candidates), the reflective statement, topic development and the production of the essay. The journal writing (for self-taught candidates) and reflective statement, of 300-400 words, is also submitted for assessment. External assessment accounts for 70% of the grade for the course. = Alternative oral examination = SL school-supported self-taught candidates undertake the alternative oral examination instead of the internal assessment components. They are essentially the same as the internal assessment components, except that they are externally assessed and some administration procedures are different. The alternative oral examination accounts for 30% of the final grade.  Internal assessment  * Individual oral commentary (SL & HL: 20 minutes preparation & 10 minutes delivery) and discussion (HL only: additional 10 minutes) (30 marks weighing 15% of the course) - SL and HL candidates complete a recorded literary analysis on an extract of a part 2 prose (20-30 lines, 40 lines for self-taught students) or the whole or part of a part 2 poem (for HL students this must be the poem studied), set with one or two guiding questions. Candidates deliver the prepared commentary for a maximum of 8 minutes, then engage in a 2-minute discussion on the extract or poem (self- taught students deliver for the full 10 minutes; there is no discussion element). HL students will then continue uninterrupted into the 10-minute discussion on another part 2 work that wasn't used for the commentary. Recordings and marks are then sent for moderation. * Individual oral presentation (30 marks weighing 15% of the course, 10 to 15 minutes) - Candidates prepare and deliver a presentation based on a part 4 work or works studied (self-taught students must use two of the works). Candidates can choose a topic on their own personal interest based on any aspect of the work(s) chosen. The presentation can be in the form of a standard analysis or a creative activity (this requires a rationale). The presentation can be created in pairs or small groups, but each candidate must present individually. This component is not recorded or submitted (except for self- taught students, where both the recording and notes in point form are submitted for external assessment) and is moderated through the individual oral commentary. Internal assessment accounts for the remaining 30% of the final grade of the course. = Available languages = As of the 2014 exam session, courses in the following languages are automatically available in May examination sessions, while those denoted with (N) are also automatically available in November (i.e. fewer languages are available in November compared to May): * Albanian * Amharic * Arabic * Belarusian * Bengali * Bosnian * Bulgarian * Catalan * Chinese (N) * Croatian * Czech * Danish * Dutch * English (N) * Estonian * Filipino * Finnish * French (N) * German (N) * Hebrew * Hindi * Hungarian * Icelandic * Indonesian (N) * Italian * Japanese (N) * Korean (N) * Latvian * Lithuanian * Macedonian * Malay * Modern Greek * Nepali * Norwegian * Persian * Polish * Portuguese (N) * Romanian * Russian * Serbian * Sesotho * Sinhala * Slovak * Slovene * Spanish (N) * Swahili * Swedish * Thai * Turkish (N) * Ukrainian * Urdu * Vietnamese * Welsh Exams in other languages are available upon special request (only available for May sessions), except for Afrikaans and Swati (SL only) which are only available in the November session.  Language A: language and literature  Language A: language and literature is a new course for first examinations 2013, intended to replace the Language A2 course in group 2. The main aim of the course is to \\"encourage students to question the meaning generated by language and texts, which, it can be argued, is rarely straightforward and unambiguous\\". The course is available at both Standard Level (SL) and Higher Level (HL). The course is currently only available in 17 languages. = Syllabus = The course is divided into four parts - two of language and two of literature. * Part 1: Language in cultural context (SL: 40 hours, HL: 60 hours) - This part explores how language develops in specific cultural contexts, its impact on the world and how it forms individual and group identity. It enables candidates to investigate the role of language in relation to many areas involved in the construction of meaning and understanding of particular issues in the world. Some topics that can be explored in this part are gender issues, sexuality, communities, individual identity, power, history of the language, translation, science and technology, social relations, beliefs and taboos. * Part 2: Language and mass communication (SL: 40 hours, HL: 60 hours) - This part focuses on the exploration of the use of language in the media, including newspapers, magazines, the internet, mobile telephony, radio and film. It also discusses how the creation and reception of texts is influenced by its delivery medium. Some topics that can be explored in this part are bias, stereotypes, popular culture, speeches and campaigns, government administration, media institutions, editing, persuasive language and entertainment. * Part 3: Literature ‚Äî texts and contexts (SL: 2 texts, 40 hours; HL: 3 texts, 70 hours) - In this part, candidates explore the ways in which social, cultural and historical contexts influence the creation of literary text through close reading and analysis. Candidates will also acknowledge that interpretations of texts differ between people of different backgrounds. For both SL and HL one text must be taken from the prescribed literature in translation (PLT) list. For SL, the other text can be chosen freely, as long as it is originally written in the language being studied. For HL, the second text must be taken from the prescribed list of authors (PLA) for the studied language, and the last text can be chosen freely without restrictions. * Part 4: Literature ‚Äî critical study (SL: 2 texts, 30 hours; HL: 3 texts, 50 hours) - In this part, candidates will explore literary texts closely, analyse texts and make use of literary terms. All texts chosen for this part must be taken from the PLA. = Assessment = There are three external assessment components and two internal assessment components.  External assessment  * Paper 1: Textual analysis (SL: 1 hour 30 minutes)/Comparative textual analysis (HL: 2 hours) (20 marks weighing 25% of the course) - SL candidates write an analytic commentary on one unseen text from a choice of two, and HL candidates write a comparative analytic commentary on one pair of unseen texts from a choice of two pairs. * Paper 2: Essay (25 marks weighing 25% of the syllabus, 1 hour 30 minutes for SL, 2 hours for HL) - Candidates respond to one of the six questions given by writing an essay based on at least two texts studied in part 3 of the course. They are expected to demonstrate the learning outcomes of part 3 through the analysis of how the meaning of the texts is shaped by the contexts of production and reception. * Written tasks (20 marks (SL)/40 marks (HL) weighing 20% of the course) - SL students will need to produce at least three written tasks (at least one based on parts 1 or 2, and at least one based on parts 3 or 4) throughout the course. One of these is submitted for assessment. HL students will need to produce at least four written tasks (at least one based on parts 1 or 2, at least one based on parts 3 or 4, and at least one of task 2). Two of these are submitted for assessment. ** The SL written task and HL written task 1 are creative pieces of writing used to explore an aspect of the material in the course. Students are free to choose the topic and type of text for the written tasks as long as it is not a formal essay or commentary of any kind. Each task must be within 800 to 1000 words and a rationale of 200 to 300 words must be included before it. ** The HL written task 2 is a critical response to one of the six prescribed questions, two from each area of study. Each task must be within 800 to 1000 words. External assessment accounts for 70% of the grade for the course.  Internal assessment  * Individual oral commentary (30 marks weighing 15% of the course, 20 minutes preparation & 15 minutes delivery) - Candidates prepare and deliver a recorded critical commentary on an extract (not more than 40 lines, or a full poem) of a part 4 text, set with two guiding questions. Candidates deliver the commentary for about 10 minutes, then engage in a discussion with the teacher for about 5 minutes. Recordings and marks are sent for external moderation. * Further oral activity (30 marks weighing 15% of the course) - Candidates must complete at least two oral activities, at least one based on part 1 and at least one based on part 2. This allows candidates to explore some of the topics of the two parts of the course. It can be any form of activity the student prefers, depending on the classroom arrangement. The mark for the best activity is submitted for final assessment. Internal assessment accounts for the remaining 30% of the final grade of the course. = Available languages = This course, as of exams in 2014, is currently only available in the following 17 languages for the May session. The 7 languages which are also available in November sessions are denoted with an (N). * Arabic * Chinese (N) * Dutch * English (N) * French (N) * German (N) * Indonesian (N) * Italian * Japanese * Korean * Modern Greek * Norwegian * Portuguese (N) * Russian * Spanish (N) * Swedish * Thai There is no special request service for Language A: language and literature.  Literature and performance  Literature and performance (known as Text and performance in the pilot stage) is a new interdisciplinary subject, available from first examinations in 2013. It is a combination of literature and theatre arts, thus satisfying both the requirements of group 1 and group 6. It is only available at standard level (SL). The course aims to enable candidates to link and explore the relationship between the two components of literature and performance. = Syllabus = The course is split into three parts. * Part 1: Critical study of texts (50 hours) - Candidates read closely a variety of literary texts and interpret, explore the meaning and analyse the effect of each text. * Part 2: Exploration of the chosen approach to the text (40 hours) - Candidates explore texts in terms of their performance potential, and formulate ideas to change prose and poetry into a dramatic performance. * Part 3: Realization of texts in performance (60 hours) - Candidates learn to prepare a performance and deliver scripted drama to an audience.

The coursework must be between 1500 and 2000 words long. The external assessment components carries 60% of the final grade of the course.  Internal assessment  * Performance (5 minutes) and individual oral presentation (15 minutes) (40 marks weighing 40% of the course) - Candidates deliver one performance during the course, based on the transformation of one or more poetry and prose texts studied. The texts chosen cannot be the ones used for papers 1 and 2. Following that, candidates give a structured oral presentation about his or her performance.

History and description The strait has proved important at several points in Korean history. The seclusion it provided allowed the Sambyeolcho Rebellion to take refuge here in 1271. In 1597, during the Imjin War, the Korean admiral, Yi Sun-sin, achieved a decisive victory in the Battle of Myeongnyang although he was massively outnumbered by the Japanese fleet. Tidal forces make current of the Myeongnyang Strait reverse direction roughly every three hours. Today, the strait is spanned by the Jindo (island) bridge, South Korea's longest suspension bridge. There is also a memorial to Yi Sun- sin on the coast. The Myeongnyang Strait, during the lifetime of Yi Sun-Shin, was also known as 'Uldolmok,' or 'the Roaring Channel,' most likely because of the powerful tidal forces occupying and traversing the channel, which were especially loud during springtime.

Biography The Israeli delegation to the 1949 Armistice Agreements talks. Left to right: Commanders Yehoshafat Harkabi, Aryeh Simon, Yigael Yadin, and Yitzhak Rabin (1949) Harkabi had a good command of Arabic, a deep knowledge of Arab civilization and history, and a solid understanding of Islam. He developed from an uncompromising hardliner to supporter of a Palestinian state who recognized the PLO as a negotiations partner. In his most well-known work Israel's Fateful Hour, Harkabi described himself as a \\"Machiavellian dove\\" intent on searching \\"for a policy by which Israel can get the best possible settlement of the conflict in the Middle East\\" (1988, p. xx) - a policy that would include a Zionism \\"of quality and not of acreage\\" (p. 225). Harkabi was forced to resign as chief of Military Intelligence as a consequence of the 1959 Night of the Ducks. Following his military career, Harkabi served as a visiting professor at Princeton University and guest scholar at the Brookings Institution. He was Maurice Hexter professor and director of the Leonard Davis Institute of International Relations and Middle East Studies at Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

He served as the founding dean of the University of California, Irvine School of Law from 2008 to 2017, and is currently the dean of the University of California, Berkeley, School of Law. A study of legal publications between 2009 and 2013 found Chemerinsky to be the second-most frequently cited American legal scholar, behind Cass Sunstein and ahead of Richard Epstein.2014 Scholarly Impact ‚Äì Leitner Rankings. Chemerinsky was named a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2016. The National Jurist magazine named him the most influential person in legal education in the United States in 2017. ACS-American Constitution Society Early life and education Raised in a working-class Jewish family on Chicago's South Side, Chemerinsky attended the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools for high school. He earned a bachelor's degree in communications from Northwestern University in 1975, where he competed as a debater. He then attended Harvard Law School, where he was a member of the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau. He graduated from Harvard Law with a Juris Doctor cum laude in 1978.  Professional career  Chemerinsky taught for over twenty years at the University of Southern California Law School and at DePaul University College of Law before moving to Duke University on July 1, 2004, and then UC Irvine in July 2008. In July 2017, he started a five-year term as dean of the UC Berkeley School of Law. In 1995, Chemerinsky was a commentator on the O.J. Simpson trial on KCBS-TV, KNX, and CBS News. Chemerinsky has published six books (three of which have been printed in multiple editions), numerous articles, and a regular column on the United States Supreme Court carried by California Lawyer, the Los Angeles Daily Journal, and Trial Magazine. Chemerinsky has also argued several cases before the United States Supreme Court, including United States v. Apel, Scheidler v. NOW, Tory v. Cochran, Van Orden v. Perry and Lockyer v. Andrade. In March 2011, The National Jurist: The Magazine for Law Students named Chemerinsky one of the \\"23 Law Profs to Take Before You Die\\". Other notable work included: *Los Angeles Police Department panel reviewing the Rampart Scandal. *Los Angeles commission reviewing irregularities in city contracting. *Helped write the Los Angeles city charter. *Helped draft the Constitution of Belarus. Legal thought Chemerinsky supports gun control and disagreed with the decision in District of Columbia v. Heller. He thinks that even if an individual's right to bear arms exists, the District of Columbia was justified in restricting that right because it believed that the law would lessen violence. George Will specifically mentioned and responded to Chemerinsky's argument in a column that ran four days later. Chemerinsky believes that Roe v. Wade was correctly decided. He says, \\"Judicial activism is the label for the decision that people don't like.\\" He also believed that gay marriage should be legal many years prior to the decision in Obergefell v. Hodges. Chemerinsky also represents a client held at the Guantanamo Bay detention center. He supports affirmative action. In January 2017, Chemerinsky, along with other high-profile lawyers, sued President Donald Trump for refusing to \\"divest from his businesses\\". =Freedom of speech= Chemerinsky has defended freedom of speech from the heckler's veto. Following an incident in which nine members of the (UCI) Muslim Students Union disrupted a speech by Israeli Ambassador Michael Oren, Chemerinsky asserted that broad freedom exists to invite speakers and hold demonstrations, but that once a speaker has begun an invited lecture, \\"You have the right ‚Äì if you disagree with me ‚Äì to go outside and perform your protest. But you don't get the right to come in when I'm talking and shout me down. Otherwise people can always silence a speaker by heckler's veto, and Babel results.\\"Lumb, David, \\"Israel: Interrupted in Irvine\\", February 15, 2010, New UniversityChemerinsky, Erwin, \\"UC Irvine's free speech debate: Students and others who disrupted an address by the Israeli ambassador to the U.S. can't claim 1st Amendment rights\\", Los Angeles Times, February 18, 2010. After the interruptions, Oren completed his remarks and canceled the question-and-answer session. The students were arrested by University of California Irvine Police, which were on hand. However, Chemerinsky also publicly disagreed with the Orange County District Attorney's Office's decision to file criminal charges against the students. Appointment controversy Chemerinsky's hiring as dean of the UCI School of Law was controversial. After signing a contract on September 4, 2007, the hire was rescinded by UCI Chancellor Michael V. Drake, who felt the law professor's commentaries were \\"polarizing.\\" Drake claimed the decision was his own and not the subject of any outside influence. The action was criticized by both liberal and conservative scholars, who felt it hindered the academic mission of the law school and violated principles of academic freedom, and few believed Drake's claims that it was not the result of outside influence.Parsons, Dana, \\"Excuse for UCI's fumble on law school dean not good enough\\", Los Angeles Times, September 13, 2007. The issue was the subject of an editorial in The New York Times on Friday, September 14. Details emerged revealing that the university had received criticism on the hire from the California Supreme Court's Chief Justice Ronald M. George, who criticized Chemerinsky's grasp of death penalty appeals and a group of prominent local Republicans, including Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich, who wanted to stop the appointment. Drake traveled over a weekend to meet with Chemerinsky in Durham, North Carolina, where he was a professor at the Duke University School of Law at the time, and the two reached an agreement late Sunday evening.Therolf, Garrett, \\"Chemerinsky returns to UC Irvine post\\", Los Angeles Times, September 17, 2007. On September 17, Chemerinsky issued a joint press release with Drake indicating that Chemerinsky would head the law school. The release stated that the chancellor was \\"commit[ted] to academic freedom.\\" On September 20, 2007, Chemerinsky's hire was formally approved by the Regents of the University of California.

The illness is typically characterised by flu like symptoms combined with polyarthritis and a rash. The virus is endemic to mainland Australia and Tasmania, the island of New Guinea, Fiji, Samoa, the Cook Islands, New Caledonia and several other islands in the South Pacific. Symptoms and signs Symptoms of the disease vary widely in severity, but major indicators are arthralgia, arthritis, fever, and rash. The incubation period is 7‚Äì9 days. About a third of infections are asymptomatic, particularly in children. =Acute illness= About 95% of symptomatic cases report joint pain. This is typically symmetrical and with acute onset, affecting the fingers, toes, ankles, wrists, back, knees and elbows. Fatigue occurs in 90% and fever, myalgia and headache occur in 50‚Äì60%. A rash occurs in 50% of patients and is widespread and maculopapular. Lymphadenopathy occurs commonly; sore throat and coryza less frequently. Diarrhea is rare. About 50% of people report needing time off work with the acute illness. If the rash is unnoticed, these symptoms are quite easily mistaken for more common illnesses like influenza or the common cold. Recovery from the flu symptoms is expected within a month, but, because the virus currently cannot be removed once infection has occurred secondary symptoms of joint and muscle inflammation, pain and stiffness can last for many years.Less common manifestations include splenomegaly, hematuria and glomerulonephritis. Headache, neck stiffness, and photophobia may occur. There have been three case reports suggesting meningitis or encephalitis. =Chronic illness= Reports from the 1980s and 1990s suggested RRV infection was associated with arthralgia, fatigue and depression lasting for years. More recent prospective studies have reported a steady improvement in symptoms over the first few months, with 15‚Äì66% of patients having ongoing arthralgia at 3 months. Arthralgias have resolved in the majority by 5‚Äì7 months. The incidence of chronic fatigue is 12% at 6 months and 9% at 12 months, similar to Epstein‚ÄìBarr virus and Q fever. The only significant predictor of the likelihood of developing chronic symptoms is the severity of the acute illness itself. No other aspects of the patient's medical or psychiatric history have been found to be predictive. However, in those with the most persisting symptoms (12 months or more), comorbid rheumatologic conditions and/or depression are frequently observed. Transmission The virus is not contagious and is spread only by mosquitoes. The main reservoir hosts are kangaroos and wallabies, although horses, possums and possibly birds and flying foxes play a role. Over 30 species have been implicated as possible vectors, but the major species for Ross River fever are Culex annulirostris in inland areas, Aedes vigilax in northern coastal regions and Ae. camptorhynchus in southern coastal regions. Diagnosis A blood test is the only way to confirm a case of Ross River fever. Several types of blood tests may be used to examine antibody levels in the blood. Tests may either look for simply elevated antibodies (which indicate some sort of infection), or specific antibodies to the virus. Prevention There is currently no vaccine available. The primary method of disease prevention is minimizing mosquito bites, as the disease is only transmitted by mosquitoes. Typical advice includes use of mosquito repellent and mosquito screens, wearing light coloured clothing, and minimising standing water around homes (e.g. removing Bromeliads, plant pots, garden ponds). Staying indoors during dusk/dawn hours when mosquitos are most active may also be effective. Bush camping is a common precipitant of infection so particular care is required. Treatment  Antiviral drugs, that target infections with RRV. Patients are usually managed with simple analgesics, anti-inflammatories, anti-pyretics and rest while the illness runs its course. Pentosan polysulfate has also shown recent promise. https://www.sbs.com.au/news/breakthrough-in-ross-river-virus-battle Epidemiology Most notifications are from Queensland, tropical Western Australia and the Northern Territory. Geographical risk factors include areas of higher rainfall and higher maximal tides. In the tropics, Ross River fever is more prevalent during the summer/autumn \\"wet season\\", particularly January‚ÄîMarch, when mosquito populations numbers are high. In southern parts of Australia, this time period may shift to earlier in the year during spring/summer. Areas noted of common place contraction of the virus include townships and along the River Murray areas. Backwaters and Lagoons are breeding grounds for mosquitos and local medical treating facilities report higher cases than cities away from the river around the riverina areas. Areas near suitable mosquito breeding grounds‚Äîmarshes, wetlands, waterways and farms with irrigation systems‚Äîare high risk areas for outbreaks. As such, the disease is more characteristic of rural and regional areas. Infection is most common in adults aged 25‚Äì44 years old, with males and females equally affected. Ross River fever is on the Australian Department of Health and Ageing's list of notifiable diseases. History The first outbreak of RRF was in 1928 in the Hay and Narrandera region in New South Wales, Australia.Australian Family Physician: Ross River virus The virus was first isolated in 1959 from a mosquito trapped along the Ross River in Townsville, Queensland. Since then, outbreaks have occurred in all Australian states, including Tasmania, and metropolitan areas. The largest outbreak occurred in 1979‚Äì1980 in the Western Pacific, and affected more than 60,000 people. Before the identification of this infectious agent, the disease was referred to as \\"epidemic polyarthritis\\". This term was also used for a similar Australian disease caused by another mosquito-borne virus, Barmah Forest virus. Research The study of RRF has been recently facilitated by the development of a mouse model. Mice infected with RRV develop hind-limb arthritis/arthralgia which is similar to human disease. The disease in mice is characterized by an inflammatory infiltrate including macrophages which are immunopathogenic and exacerbate disease. Furthermore, mice deficient in the C3 protein do not suffer from severe disease following infection. This indicates that an aberrant innate immune response is responsible for severe disease following RRV infection.

Instead, the optimal course of action is contingent (dependent) upon the internal and external situation. A contingent leader effectively applies their own style of leadership to the right situation. Contingent leaders are flexible in choosing and adapting to succinct strategies to suit change in situation at a particular period in time in the running of the organization. History The contingency approach to leadership was influenced by two earlier research programs endeavoring to pinpoint effective leadership behavior. During the 1950s, researchers at Ohio State University administered extensive questionnaires measuring a range of possible leader behaviors in various organizational contexts. Although multiple sets of leadership behaviors were originally identified based on these questionnaires, two types of behaviors proved to be especially typical of effective leaders: (1) consideration leader behaviors that include building good rapport and interpersonal relationships and showing support and concern for subordinates and (2) initiating structure leader behaviors that provided structure (e.g., role assignment, planning, scheduling) to ensure task completion and goal attainment. About the same time, investigators from the University of Michigan's Survey Research Center conducted interviews and distributed questionnaires in organizations and collected measures of group productivity to assess effective leadership behaviors. The leadership behavior categories that emerged from the University of Chicago were similar to the consideration and initiating structure behaviors identified by the Ohio State studies. The University of Michigan investigators, however, termed these leadership behaviors relation-oriented behavior and task-oriented behavior. This line of research was later extended by Robert Blake and Jane Mouton in 1964 to suggest that effective leaders score high on both these behaviors. They suggested that previous theories such as Weber's bureaucracy and Taylor's scientific management had failed because they neglected that management style and organizational structure were influenced by various aspects of the environment: the contingency factors. There could not be \\"one best way\\" for leadership or organization. Historically, contingency theory has sought to formulate broad generalizations about the formal structures that are typically associated with or best fit the use of different technologies. The perspective originated with the work of Joan Woodward (1958), who argued that technologies directly determine differences in such organizational attributes as span of control, centralization of authority, and the formalization of rules and procedures. Contingency approaches Gareth Morgan in his book Images of Organization summarized the main ideas underlying contingency: * Organizations are open systems that need careful management to satisfy and balance internal needs and to adapt to environmental circumstances * There is not one best way of organizing. The appropriate form depends on the kind of task or environment one is dealing with. * Management must be concerned, above all else, with achieving alignments and good fits * Different types or species of organizations are needed in different types of environments Fred Fiedler's contingency model focused on a contingency model of leadership in organizations. This model contains the relationship between leadership style and the favorable-ness of the situation. Fielder developed a metric to measure a leader's style called the Least Preferred Co-worker. The Contingency Model-- New Directions for Leadership Utilization, Journal of Contemporary Business, Vol. 3, No. 4 (Autumn 1978) pg 65-80 The test consists of 16-22 items they are to rate on a scale of one to eight as they think of a co-worker they had the most difficulty working with. A high score indicates the test taker is relational in style and a low score indicates the test taker is more task orientated in style. Situational favorable-ness was described by Fiedler in terms of three empirically derived dimensions: # Leader-member relationship ‚Äì high if the leader is generally accepted and respected by followers # Degree of task structure ‚Äì high if the task is very structured # Leader's position power ‚Äì high if a great deal of authority and power are formally attributed to the leader's position Situations are favorable to the leader if all three of these dimensions are high. William Richard Scott describes contingency theory in the following manner: \\"The best way to organize depends on the nature of the environment to which the organization must relate\\". The work of other researchers including Paul R. Lawrence, Jay Lorsch, and James D. Thompson complements this statement. They are more interested in the impact of contingency factors on organizational structure. Their structural contingency theory was the dominant paradigm of organizational structural theories for most of the 1970s. A major empirical test was furnished by Johannes M Pennings who examined the interaction between environmental uncertainty, organization structure and various aspects of performance. Pennings carried out an empirical study on a sample of retail brokerage offices in which aspects of their market environment such as competitiveness, change and munificence, versus organizational arrangements such as decision making templates, power distribution were juxtaposed for possible implications for performance.

Together with a group of much smaller islands, it forms Jindo County. It is located in South Jeolla province, just off the southwest corner of the Korean peninsula. The island is separated from the mainland by the Myeongnyang Strait; however, this strait is now spanned by South Korea's longest cable-stayed bridge spanning 484 meters. Here in 1597 admiral Yi Sun-sin won the Battle of Myeongnyang, defeating a vastly superior Japanese fleet. The Korea Jindo Dog is native to Jindo Island. Every year, on a variable day in the spring or summer, a narrow land pass (about 2.9 km long and up to 40 meters wide) opens for about an hour between the main Jindo Island and small Modo island as a result of tidal activity. This event attracts hundreds of thousands of tourists and is accompanied by local festivals. History An old painting of a panokseon. The island was known and inhabited since prehistoric time. In 995, it was called Haeyangdo, and later renamed to Okju county and became one of the 14 Korean states. In 1001, the island Okju was changed to Jindo. During the Mongol invasions of Korea of 1231‚Äì1270, the island served as a refuge for the Sambyeolcho Rebellion forces.Hy≈èng-sik Sin A Brief history of Korea, Vol. 1, Ewha Womans University Press, 2005 , p. 68 However, in 1271, Mongols captured the island and removed all settlements from there. The population that returned after the Mongol invasion was constantly threatened by Japanese pirates invasions, and thus the island was nearly empty during the 14th century.History , Jindo County On 16 September 1597, during the Seven Year War, the Korean admiral Yi Sun-sin achieved a decisive victory in the Battle of Myeongnyang held at the Myeongnyang Strait. With 13 panokseons and about 200 men he defeated the Japanese fleet of 133 warships and 200 support ships.Ê°ë Áî∞Âø†Ë¶™ [Kuwata, Tadachika], ed., ÊóßÂèÇË¨ÄÊú¨ÈÉ®Á∑®Á∫Ç, [Kyu Sanbo Honbu], ÊúùÈÆÆ„ÅÆÂΩπ [Chosen no Eki] (Êó•Êú¨„ÅÆÊà¶Âè≤ [Nihon no Senshi] Vol. 5), 1965, p. 192.Nanjung Ilgi.

London: Cassell & Co, 2002, , p. 202 During the lifetime of Yi Sun-sin, the strait was also known as 'Uldolmok,' or 'the Roaring Channel,' most likely due to the powerful tidal forces in the channel, which were especially loud in spring. Myeongnyang Strait The Myeongnyang Strait (Hangul: Î™ÖÎüâÌï¥Ìòë, Hanja: È≥¥Ê¢ÅÊµ∑Â≥Ω, Revised Romanization: Myeongnyang Haehyeop, McCune‚ÄìReischauer: My≈èngnyang Haehy≈èp; meaning screaming sea) separates Jindo Island and Jindo County from Haenam County on the mainland. At its narrowest point, the strait is about 300 meters wide and up to 22 meters deep, with the tide variations up to 6 meters in spring. The tidal currents reach up to 6 m/s and are considered as the fastest in Asia. Combined with a whirlpool in the strait, these fast tides hinder navigation. The area is frequently hit by typhoons with typical average wind speeds of 48 m/s. The coastline is very irregular and contains numerous minor valleys, mountains and islets. The shores are steep and are made by eroding igneous and volcanic rocks. There is significant navigation in the strait.M. J. King, et al.

As a rider, Vasseur competed between 1993 and 2007 for the Novemail‚ÄìHistor, , , and squads. Vasseur was considered an all-rounder who could do well in a variety of races. He raced in all of the spring classics such as Tour of Flanders and Paris‚ÄìRoubaix, and won a stage of the Dauphin√© Lib√©r√© stage race as well as two at the Tour de France. Career =Professional rider= Born in Hazebrouck, Nord, Vasseur turned professional with the team Novemail in 1993, and switched to the team in 1995 which then became Cr√©dit Agricole in 1998. His first professional victory is also his most famous: it was his solo 147-kilometre breakaway by which he won stage 5 of the 1997 Tour de France. He then wore the yellow jersey as the race leader for five days. In the 2000 and 2001 seasons, he rode for the team and participated in the 2000 Tour de France. However, his exclusion from the 2001 Tour de France team led to his switch to the Cofidis team. He cited personal differences with the USPS team star Lance Armstrong, which was widely quoted in French cycling publications. In the wake of the publication of the USADA memo that proves Lance Armstrong doping practices, he explained that he was excluded because of his refusal to participate in Armstrong's doping program. (\\"Inutile de rappeler que je n'ai rien √† voir dans cette organisation √† qui je dois fort probablement ma non- participation au Tour 2001 ainsi que mon √©viction de l'√©quipe.\\") In 2004, Vasseur was arrested in suspicion of doping offences along with several other Cofidis riders, notably including then individual time trial champion David Millar. A counter-analysis later proved negative and Vasseur's name was then cleared. Vasseur also claimed some of the evidence in his witness statement had been forged. However, Vasseur was barred from riding in the 2004 Tour de France since the investigation had not concluded by the time that the race had started. He retired at the end of 2007 after taking a second Tour de France stage win that year. =After retirement= Following his retirement from racing, Vasseur served as head of the CPA (the professional cyclists' association), and as a TV pundit. In October 2017 the team announced that Vasseur would return to the team as their new manager. Personal life Vasseur came from a family of cyclists: his father Alain Vasseur competed in the 1970, 1971 and 1974 editions of the Tour de France. His father also won a stage of the Tour de France after a solo breakaway.

The station is owned by the Borough of Pompton Lakes and is currently simulcasting WTBQ's full-service format. History On September 14, 1964, WGHT signed on as WKER, call letters for the founder, Bob Kerr. WKER served as a test market station for radio stations like 77-WABC in the 1960s. The station initially ran a contemporary MOR format that evolved to a full- service adult contemporary format. The station was strictly a daytimer signing on at dawn and signing off at dusk. In early 1993, Bob Kerr's estate sold the radio station to John Silliman, formerly an on-air personality at various other radio stations over the years. Upon taking ownership, Silliman applied for a call sign change to WGHT (which stands for \\"We've got the Greatest Hits of all time!\\"). This application was accepted by the FCC on August 6, 1993. WGHT broadcast an oldies-classic hits music format playing a deep and wide variety of music from 1952 to about 2000. Recent WGHT personnel included midday air personality as well as general manager Silliman and program director Jimmy Howes. Howes was also WGHT's chief engineer and operations manager. WGHT's News Director was award-winning reporter and newscaster Mike Forte. The station had a cult following in terms of and a professional staff. The station won quite a few awards for their programming. Eventually WGHT had from the FCC a pre-sunrise authorization to sign on at 6:00 a.m. even during the months the sun rose after and a post-sunset authorization for 6:00 p.m. during the months sunset happened earlier. In the last year WGHT would still sign off at 6:00 p.m. even in the summer months when the station could remain on the air as late as 8:30 p.m. As with many AM radio stations, selling advertising was becoming difficult. Getting a low-power FM translator was looked into but ultimately rejected by ownership. Also, options such as brokering the station various times of the day were looked at and it was determined that if the station could not be live and local with the programming local people are used to it would be better to just close the station down. In June, it was announced that WGHT would close late in the summer or in the fall. On September 22, 2017, Mariana Broadcasting filed an application with the FCC for consent to transfer ownership of WGHT as part of a donation to the Borough of Pompton Lakes.WGHT/Pompton Lakes Files Papers To Donate Station To City (Retrieved 26 September 2016 from All Access Music Group)Mariana Broadcasting application for consent to assignment of broadcast station construction permit or license (Retrieved 26 September 2006 from FCC website.) Pompton Lakes does not plan on operating the station and is looking for a partner to run it. On December 15, 2017, ownership was transferred and the station went silent. Silliman conducted the signoff.WGHT Signs-Off On December 13, 2018 WGHT began temporarily simulcasting WALL radio, which is based in the Hudson Valley, NY in order to keep its broadcast license valid, a couple of days later WGHT again went silent. In March 2019, Frank Truatt, owner of 1110 WTBQ/93.5 W228CG in Warwick, New York, announced plans to begin operating WGHT under a Local Marketing Agreement with the option to purchase the station and its construction permit for 98.3 W252ED.

It was written by Clifford Odets and based on a novel of the same name by Cornell Woolrich (as William Irish). The RKO Pictures film release was the only cinematic collaboration between Clurman and his former Group Theatre associate, screenwriter Odets. The director of photography was RKO regular Nicholas Musuraca. The musical score was by German refugee composer Hanns Eisler.. Plot U.S. Navy sailor Alex Winkley (Bill Williams) wakes up from a night of drinking in New York City and finds he has a wad of cash. His memory is hazy, but he knows he got it from a woman he had visited earlier in the evening, Edna Bartelli (Lola Lane). With the help of dance-hall girl June Goffe (Susan Hayward), he attempts to return the money, only to find out that the woman is dead. The sailor is not sure if he is the killer or not. Alex and June, along with a philosophical cabbie (Paul Lukas), stay up all night, attempting to solve the murder mystery before the sailor has to catch a bus to the naval base in Norfolk, Virginia, in the morning. Their deadline is at dawn. During the film, the many false leads and red herrings involve a blind piano player named Sleepy Parsons (Marvin Miller) and a young couple. Bartelli had been blackmailing men with whom she had had affairs, thus many suspects are possible. The woman's brother Val (Joseph Calleia) adds a touch of menace to the plot. The surprise ending resolves all issues, including the relationship between Alex and June. Cast Production Richard Fleischer says that Sid Rogell, head of RKO's B Picture unit, bullied Harold Clurman during production meetings, saying he would \\"kick the director right in the balls\\". He says Clurman accepted it without complaint. The dialogue contains Odets' trademark New York wisecracks. For example, while dancing at club early in the movie, the Hayward character likens the dance hall to a post office, filled with second-class matter. Edna Bartelli greets her ex-husband by saying, \\"Aren't you dead yet?\\" There are many \\"slice of life\\" characterizations of big city people in small roles, such as a tired banana salesman, an angry building superintendent, a refugee with a skin condition who has a crush on June, and a wisecracking sidewalk pitchman. Odets' Group Theatre colleague Roman Bohnen appears in a bit part, as a grief-stricken man with a dying cat. Reception =Critical response= Film critic Dennis Schwartz somewhat liked the film, writing, \\"Broadway's Harold Clurman takes his only stab at film directing, after the breakup of his Group Theatre, in this odd psychological thriller noted for its flowery dialogue and muddled story line ... It's penned by playwright Clifford Odets from a story by Cornell Woolrich. Though enjoyable by virtue of its distorted mise-en-sc√®ne, affection for NYC characters and its misplaced chatter, this is not art but run-of-the-mill film noir. Set in Manhattan, yet Deadline used no location shots but was filmed entirely in the studio's back lots. Cinematographer Nick Musuraca does a fine job creating an atmospheric scene of NYC's downtrodden and unhappy souls roaming the dark streets.\\"Schwartz, Dennis .

She is most famous for her work on the Leningrad radio during the city's blockade, when she became the symbol of city's strength and determination. Early life Olga Berggolts was born in a working suburb of St. Petersburg. Her father Fyodor Christophorovich Berggolts (1885‚Äî1948) was a surgeon of half-Russian and half-Latvian descent, although in 1942 he was forcefully sent to the Krasnoyarsk Krai as \\"an ethnic German and a son of a principal shareholder\\" (his father was in fact a factory worker).Olga Berggolts (2011). Olga. Forbidden Diary. ‚Äî Moscow: Azbuka Attikus, 444 pages (diaries 1939‚Äì1949, letters, documents and photos) He studied in the Imperial Military Medical Academy under Nikolay Burdenko and served as a military doctor during the World War I; after the October Revolution he was mobilized by the Red Army and continued working at the hospital train. Olga's mother Maria Timofeevna Berggolts (n√©e Grustilina) (1884‚Äî1957) was a native Russian. She also had a younger sister Maria (1912‚Äî2003) who would later become an actress of the Leningrad State Theatre of Musical Comedy. With the start of the Russian Civil War in 1918 Fyodor Berggolts sent his family to Uglich where they lived in the former Bogoyavlensky Monastery up until 1921. Upon return Olga entered a Petrograd labor school which she finished in 1926. Career Her verses dedicated to Vladimir Lenin were first published in 1924. In 1925 she joined a youth literature group 'The Shift' where she became acquainted with Boris Kornilov. In 1927 Boris and Olga entered the State Institute of Art History, and in 1928 they got married. Same year their daughter Irina was born. Soon the institute was shut down. Some of the students ‚Äî including Olga, but not Boris ‚Äî were moved to the Leningrad University. In 1930 she graduated from the philological faculty and was sent to Kazakhstan to work as a journalist for the Soviet Steppe newspaper. During this period Olga divorced Kornilov and married her fellow student Nikolay Molchanov. She also published her first book for children Winter-Summer-Parrot (1930). After returning to Leningrad in 1931 she started working as a journalist for the newspaper of the electric power plant (Electric Power). In 1932 she gave birth to her second daughter Maya who died in just a year. Her feelings and thoughts on this period were expressed in such books as The Out-of-the-way Place (1932), Night (1935), Journalists (1934), and Grains (1935). Such works by Berggolts as Poems (1934) and Uglich (1932) were approved of by Maxim Gorky. In 1934 she joined the Union of Soviet Writers. During the late 1930s Berggolts survived several personal tragedies. Her first daughter Irina died in 1936 aged seven, and in 1937 she lost her third child during the full-term pregnancy following the interrogation on the so-called \\"Averbakh Case\\" (she contacted Leopold Averbakh of the Russian Association of Proletarian Writers at the start of 1930). Soon her former husband Boris Kornilov was arrested \\"for taking part in the anti-Soviet Trotskyist organization\\" and executed on February 1938. On December Olga herself was arrested on the same account and imprisoned. She spent seven months in prison, but denied all accusations. All this caused a birth of her fourth stillborn child. During that time period she wrote poems published as a Trial anthology during the 1960s. She was subsequently released and completely exonerated in 1939. In 1940 she joined the Communist Party. After a long period of silence her novel Dream and a book of stories Vitya Mamanin were published to a great acclaim, although she had to hide her prison poetry. War years With the start of the Great Patriotic War on June 1941 Olga Berggolts was sent to work at the Leningrad Radio House. She spent almost every day of the blockade in Leningrad working at the radio, encouraging hungry and depressed citizens of the city by her speeches and poems. Her thoughts and impressions on this period, on problems of heroism, love, faithfulness can be found in February Diary (1942), Leningrad Poem (1942), Your Way (1945), and some others. On January 1942 she survived another personal tragedy: her second husband Nikolay Molchanov died of hunger. Olga later dedicated a poem 29 January 1942 and her book The Knot (1965) to Nikolay. On March 1942 Olga, who suffered from a critical form of dystrophy, was forcefully sent by her friends to Moscow using the Road of Life, despite her protests. On 20 April she returned to Leningrad and continued her work at the Radio House. On her return she married Georgy Makogonenko, a literary critic, also a radio host during the siege. In 1943 she was awarded the Medal \\"For the Defence of Leningrad\\". Together with her husband she wrote a screenplay turned a play Born in Leningrad and a requiem In Memory of Defenders (1944) on the request of a woman whose brother was killed during the last days of the siege. On January 27, 1945 Berggolts, Makogonenko and their colleagues released a \\"radio film\\" entitled 900 days that included various fragments of reports, voices, sounds and music pieces recorded during the siege. She also published a book of memoirs Leningrad Is Talking and a play They Lived in Leningrad based on her war experience. Late years Berggolts also wrote many times about heroic and glorious events in the history of Russia, such as Pervorossyisk (1950), a poem about the Altay commune organized by the workers of Petrograd; Faithfulness (1954), a tragedy about the defence of Sevastopol in 1941‚Äì1942; and The Day Stars (1959), an autobiographical novel that was turned into a movie of the same name by Igor Talankin in 1968. Olga's voice could be also heard in another Talankin's movie Introduction to Life (1963) as she reads her poetry. On May 9, 1960 Piskaryovskoye Memorial Cemetery was opened dedicated to the victims of the Siege of Leningrad, with the words by Olga Berggolts engraved on the wall behind the Motherland monument. The last line \\"No one is forgotten, nothing is forgotten\\" became a catchphrase since, often mentioned in Russia during memorial days. Olga Berggolts died on 13 November 1975, and was buried at Literatorskie Mostki of the Volkovo Cemetery.Tomb at the Litmostki website Honours and legacy * Stalin Prize, third class (1951) ‚Äì for the poem \\"Pervorossiisk\\" (1950) * Order of Lenin * Order of the Red Banner of Labour * Medal \\"For the Defence of Leningrad\\" (1943) * Medal \\"For Valiant Labour in the Great Patriotic War 1941‚Äì1945\\" * Honorary citizen of St. Petersburg (1994) A minor planet 3093 Bergholz discovered by Soviet astronomer Tamara Mikhaylovna Smirnova in 1971 is named after her.Dictionary of Minor Planet Names ‚Äì p. 240 A street in the Nevsky District bears her name, as well as a central street in Uglich.Olga Berggolts street on Yandex MapsOlga Berggolts street on Yandex Maps A monument in her memory was opened in Saint Petersburg on May 2015.Opening of the Olga Berggolts Memorial by Interpress.ru Also on June the complete collection of diaries by Olga Berggolts was published for the first time by the Russian State Archive of Literature and Art.Tatiana Goryaeva.

Major advances in the theory were made in the 1940s and 1950s, and led to the introduction of renormalized quantum electrodynamics (QED). QED was so successful and accurately predictive that efforts were made to apply the same basic concepts for the other forces of nature. By the late 1970s, these efforts successfully utilized gauge theory in the strong nuclear force and weak nuclear force, producing the modern standard model of particle physics. Efforts to describe gravity using the same techniques have, to date, failed. The study of quantum field theory is still flourishing, as are applications of its methods to many physical problems. It remains one of the most vital areas of theoretical physics today, providing a common language to several different branches of physics.  Early developments  Quantum field theory originated in the 1920s from the problem of creating a quantum mechanical theory of the electromagnetic field. In particular, de Broglie in 1924 introduced the idea of a wave description of elementary systems in the following way: \\"we proceed in this work from the assumption of the existence of a certain periodic phenomenon of a yet to be determined character, which is to be attributed to each and every isolated energy parcel\\". In 1925, Werner Heisenberg, Max Born, and Pascual Jordan constructed just such a theory by expressing the field's internal degrees of freedom as an infinite set of harmonic oscillators, and by then utilizing the canonical quantization procedure to these oscillators; their paper was published in 1926. The paper was received on 16 November 1925. [English translation in: ]This paper was preceded by an earlier one by Born and Jordan published in 1925. () This theory assumed that no electric charges or currents were present and today would be called a free field theory. The first reasonably complete theory of quantum electrodynamics, which included both the electromagnetic field and electrically charged matter as quantum mechanical objects, was created by Paul Dirac in 1927. This quantum field theory could be used to model important processes such as the emission of a photon by an electron dropping into a quantum state of lower energy, a process in which the number of particles changes‚Äîone atom in the initial state becomes an atom plus a photon in the final state. It is now understood that the ability to describe such processes is one of the most important features of quantum field theory. The final crucial step was Enrico Fermi's theory of Œ≤-decay (1934). In it, fermion species nonconservation was shown to follow from second quantization: creation and annihilation of fermions came to the fore and quantum field theory was seen to describe particle decays. (Fermi's breakthrough was somewhat foreshadowed in the abstract studies of Soviet physicists, Viktor Ambartsumian and Dmitri Ivanenko, in particular the Ambarzumian‚ÄìIvanenko hypothesis of creation of massive particles (1930). The idea was that not only the quanta of the electromagnetic field, photons, but also other particles might emerge and disappear as a result of their interaction with other particles.)  Incorporating special relativity  It was evident from the beginning that a proper quantum treatment of the electromagnetic field had to somehow incorporate Einstein's relativity theory, which had grown out of the study of classical electromagnetism. This need to put together relativity and quantum mechanics was the second major motivation in the development of quantum field theory. Pascual Jordan and Wolfgang Pauli showed in 1928Jagdish Mehra, Helmut Rechenberg, The Probability Interpretation and the Statistical Transformation Theory, the Physical Interpretation, and the Empirical and Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics 1926‚Äì1932, Springer, 2000, p. 199. that quantum fields could be made to behave in the way predicted by special relativity during coordinate transformations (specifically, they showed that the field commutators were Lorentz invariant). A further boost for quantum field theory came with the discovery of the Dirac equation, which was originally formulated and interpreted as a single-particle equation analogous to the Schr√∂dinger equation, but unlike the Schr√∂dinger equation, the Dirac equation satisfies both the Lorentz invariance, that is, the requirements of special relativity, and the rules of quantum mechanics. The Dirac equation accommodated the spin-1/2 value of the electron and accounted for its magnetic moment as well as giving accurate predictions for the spectra of hydrogen. The attempted interpretation of the Dirac equation as a single-particle equation could not be maintained long, however, and finally it was shown that several of its undesirable properties (such as negative-energy states) could be made sense of by reformulating and reinterpreting the Dirac equation as a true field equation, in this case for the quantized \\"Dirac field\\" or the \\"electron field\\", with the \\"negative-energy solutions\\" pointing to the existence of anti-particles. This work was performed first by Dirac himself with the invention of hole theory in 1930 and by Wendell Furry, Robert Oppenheimer, Vladimir Fock, and others. Erwin Schr√∂dinger, during the same period that he discovered his famous equation in 1926, also independently found the relativistic generalization of it known as the Klein‚ÄìGordon equation but dismissed it since, without spin, it predicted impossible properties for the hydrogen spectrum. (See Oskar Klein and Walter Gordon.) All relativistic wave equations that describe spin-zero particles are said to be of the Klein‚ÄìGordon type.  Uncertainty, again  A subtle and careful analysis in 1933 by Niels Bohr and L√©on Rosenfeld showed that there is a fundamental limitation on the ability to simultaneously measure the electric and magnetic field strengths that enter into the description of charges in interaction with radiation, imposed by the uncertainty principle, which must apply to all canonically conjugate quantities. This limitation is crucial for the successful formulation and interpretation of a quantum field theory of photons and electrons (quantum electrodynamics), and indeed, any perturbative quantum field theory. The analysis of Bohr and Rosenfeld explains fluctuations in the values of the electromagnetic field that differ from the classically \\"allowed\\" values distant from the sources of the field. Their analysis was crucial to showing that the limitations and physical implications of the uncertainty principle apply to all dynamical systems, whether fields or material particles. Their analysis also convinced most physicists that any notion of returning to a fundamental description of nature based on classical field theory, such as what Einstein aimed at with his numerous and failed attempts at a classical unified field theory, was simply out of the question. Fields had to be quantized.  Second quantization  The third thread in the development of quantum field theory was the need to handle the statistics of many-particle systems consistently and with ease. In 1927, Pascual Jordan tried to extend the canonical quantization of fields to the many-body wave functions of identical particles using a formalism which is known as statistical transformation theory;Don Howard, \\"Quantum Mechanics in Context: Pascual Jordan's 1936 Anschauliche Quantentheorie\\". this procedure is now sometimes called second quantization.Daniel Greenberger, Klaus Hentschel, Friedel Weinert (eds.), Compendium of Quantum Physics: Concepts, Experiments, History and Philosophy, Springer, 2009: \\"Quantization (First, Second)\\".Arthur I. Miller, Early Quantum Electrodynamics: A Sourcebook, Cambridge University Press, 1995, p. 18. In 1928, Jordan and Eugene Wigner found that the quantum field describing electrons, or other fermions, had to be expanded using anti- commuting creation and annihilation operators due to the Pauli exclusion principle (see Jordan‚ÄìWigner transformation). This thread of development was incorporated into many-body theory and strongly influenced condensed matter physics and nuclear physics.  The problem of infinities  Despite its early successes quantum field theory was plagued by several serious theoretical difficulties. Basic physical quantities, such as the self-energy of the electron, the energy shift of electron states due to the presence of the electromagnetic field, gave infinite, divergent contributions‚Äîa nonsensical result‚Äîwhen computed using the perturbative techniques available in the 1930s and most of the 1940s. The electron self-energy problem was already a serious issue in the classical electromagnetic field theory, where the attempt to attribute to the electron a finite size or extent (the classical electron- radius) led immediately to the question of what non-electromagnetic stresses would need to be invoked, which would presumably hold the electron together against the Coulomb repulsion of its finite-sized \\"parts\\". The situation was dire, and had certain features that reminded many of the \\"Rayleigh‚ÄìJeans catastrophe\\". What made the situation in the 1940s so desperate and gloomy, however, was the fact that the correct ingredients (the second-quantized Maxwell‚ÄìDirac field equations) for the theoretical description of interacting photons and electrons were well in place, and no major conceptual change was needed analogous to that which was necessitated by a finite and physically sensible account of the radiative behavior of hot objects, as provided by the Planck radiation law.  Renormalization procedures  This \\"divergence problem\\" was solved in the case of quantum electrodynamics through the procedure known as renormalization in 1947‚Äì49 by Hans Kramers,Kramers presented his work at the 1947 Shelter Island Conference, repeated in 1948 at the Solvay Conference. The latter did not appear in print until the Proceedings of the Solvay Conference, published in 1950 (see Laurie M. Brown (ed.), Renormalization: From Lorentz to Landau (and Beyond), Springer, 2012, p. 53). Kramers' approach was nonrelativistic (see Jagdish Mehra, Helmut Rechenberg, The Conceptual Completion and Extensions of Quantum Mechanics 1932-1941. Epilogue: Aspects of the Further Development of Quantum Theory 1942-1999: Volume 6, Part 2, Springer, 2001, p. 1050). Hans Bethe, Julian Schwinger, Richard Feynman, and Shin'ichiro Tomonaga; the procedure was systematized by Freeman Dyson in 1949. Great progress was made after realizing that all infinities in quantum electrodynamics are related to two effects: the self-energy of the electron/positron, and vacuum polarization. Renormalization requires paying very careful attention to just what is meant by, for example, the very concepts \\"charge\\" and \\"mass\\" as they occur in the pure, non- interacting field-equations. The \\"vacuum\\" is itself polarizable and, hence, populated by virtual particle (on shell and off shell) pairs, and, hence, is a seething and busy dynamical system in its own right. This was a critical step in identifying the source of \\"infinities\\" and \\"divergences\\". The \\"bare mass\\" and the \\"bare charge\\" of a particle, the values that appear in the free-field equations (non-interacting case), are abstractions that are simply not realized in experiment (in interaction). What we measure, and hence, what we must take account of with our equations, and what the solutions must account for, are the \\"renormalized mass\\" and the \\"renormalized charge\\" of a particle. That is to say, the \\"shifted\\" or \\"dressed\\" values these quantities must have when due systematic care is taken to include all deviations from their \\"bare values\\" is dictated by the very nature of quantum fields themselves.  Gauge invariance  The first approach that bore fruit is known as the \\"interaction representation\\" (see the article Interaction picture), a Lorentz-covariant and gauge-invariant generalization of time-dependent perturbation theory used in ordinary quantum mechanics, and developed by Tomonaga and Schwinger, generalizing earlier efforts of Dirac, Fock and Podolsky. Tomonaga and Schwinger invented a relativistically covariant scheme for representing field commutators and field operators intermediate between the two main representations of a quantum system, the Schr√∂dinger and the Heisenberg representations. Within this scheme, field commutators at separated points can be evaluated in terms of \\"bare\\" field creation and annihilation operators. This allows for keeping track of the time-evolution of both the \\"bare\\" and \\"renormalized\\", or perturbed, values of the Hamiltonian and expresses everything in terms of the coupled, gauge invariant \\"bare\\" field-equations. Schwinger gave the most elegant formulation of this approach. The next and most famous development is due to Richard Feynman, who, with his brilliant rules for assigning a \\"graph\\"/\\"diagram\\" to the terms in the scattering matrix (see S-matrix and Feynman diagrams). These directly corresponded (through the Schwinger‚ÄìDyson equation) to the measurable physical processes (cross sections, probability amplitudes, decay widths and lifetimes of excited states) one needs to be able to calculate. This revolutionized how quantum field theory calculations are carried-out in practice. Two classic text-books from the 1960s, James D. Bjorken, Sidney David Drell, Relativistic Quantum Mechanics (1964) and J. J. Sakurai, Advanced Quantum Mechanics (1967), thoroughly developed the Feynman graph expansion techniques using physically intuitive and practical methods following from the correspondence principle, without worrying about the technicalities involved in deriving the Feynman rules from the superstructure of quantum field theory itself. Although both Feynman's heuristic and pictorial style of dealing with the infinities, as well as the formal methods of Tomonaga and Schwinger, worked extremely well, and gave spectacularly accurate answers, the true analytical nature of the question of \\"renormalizability\\", that is, whether ANY theory formulated as a \\"quantum field theory\\" would give finite answers, was not worked-out until much later, when the urgency of trying to formulate finite theories for the strong and electro-weak (and gravitational interactions) demanded its solution. Renormalization in the case of QED was largely fortuitous due to the smallness of the coupling constant, the fact that the coupling has no dimensions involving mass, the so-called fine-structure constant, and also the zero-mass of the gauge boson involved, the photon, rendered the small- distance/high-energy behavior of QED manageable. Also, electromagnetic processes are very \\"clean\\" in the sense that they are not badly suppressed/damped and/or hidden by the other gauge interactions. By 1965 James D. Bjorken and Sidney David Drell observed: \\"Quantum electrodynamics (QED) has achieved a status of peaceful coexistence with its divergences ...\\".James D. Bjorken and Sidney David Drell, Relativistic quantum fields, McGraw-Hill, 1965, p. 85. The unification of the electromagnetic force with the weak force encountered initial difficulties due to the lack of accelerator energies high enough to reveal processes beyond the Fermi interaction range. Additionally, a satisfactory theoretical understanding of hadron substructure had to be developed, culminating in the quark model.  Non-abelian gauge theory  Thanks to the somewhat brute-force, ad hoc and heuristic early methods of Feynman, and the abstract methods of Tomonaga and Schwinger, elegantly synthesized by Freeman Dyson, from the period of early renormalization, the modern theory of quantum electrodynamics (QED) has established itself. It is still the most accurate physical theory known, the prototype of a successful quantum field theory. Quantum electrodynamics is the most famous example of what is known as an Abelian gauge theory. It relies on the symmetry group U(1) and has one massless gauge field, the U(1) gauge symmetry, dictating the form of the interactions involving the electromagnetic field, with the photon being the gauge boson. Beginning in the 1950s with the work of Yang and Mills, following the previous lead of Weyl and Pauli, deep explorations illuminated the types of symmetries and invariances any field theory must satisfy. QED, and indeed, all field theories, were generalized to a class of quantum field theories known as gauge theories. That symmetries dictate, limit and necessitate the form of interaction between particles is the essence of the \\"gauge theory revolution\\". Yang and Mills formulated the first explicit example of a non-abelian gauge theory, Yang‚ÄìMills theory, with an attempted explanation of the strong interactions in mind. The strong interactions were then (incorrectly) understood in the mid-1950s, to be mediated by the pi- mesons, the particles predicted by Hideki Yukawa in 1935, based on his profound reflections concerning the reciprocal connection between the mass of any force-mediating particle and the range of the force it mediates. This was allowed by the uncertainty principle. In the absence of dynamical information, Murray Gell-Mann pioneered the extraction of physical predictions from sheer non-abelian symmetry considerations, and introduced non-abelian Lie groups to current algebra and so the gauge theories that came to supersede it. The 1960s and 1970s saw the formulation of a gauge theory now known as the Standard Model of particle physics, which systematically describes the elementary particles and the interactions between them. The strong interactions are described by quantum chromodynamics (QCD), based on \\"color\\" SU(3). The weak interactions require the additional feature of spontaneous symmetry breaking, elucidated by Yoichiro Nambu and the adjunct Higgs mechanism, considered next.  Electroweak unification  The electroweak interaction part of the standard model was formulated by Sheldon Glashow, Abdus Salam, and John Clive Ward in 1959 with their discovery of the SU(2)xU(1) group structure of the theory. In 1967, Steven Weinberg brilliantly invoked the Higgs mechanism for the generation of the W and Z masses (the intermediate vector bosons responsible for the weak interactions and neutral-currents) and keeping the mass of the photon zero. The Goldstone and Higgs idea for generating mass in gauge theories was sparked in the late 1950s and early 1960s when a number of theoreticians (including Yoichiro Nambu, Steven Weinberg, Jeffrey Goldstone, Fran√ßois Englert, Robert Brout, G. S. Guralnik, C. R. Hagen, Tom Kibble and Philip Warren Anderson) noticed a possibly useful analogy to the (spontaneous) breaking of the U(1) symmetry of electromagnetism in the formation of the BCS ground-state of a superconductor. The gauge boson involved in this situation, the photon, behaves as though it has acquired a finite mass. There is a further possibility that the physical vacuum (ground-state) does not respect the symmetries implied by the \\"unbroken\\" electroweak Lagrangian from which one arrives at the field equations (see the article Electroweak interaction for more details). The electroweak theory of Weinberg and Salam was shown to be renormalizable (finite) and hence consistent by Gerardus 't Hooft and Martinus Veltman. The Glashow‚ÄìWeinberg‚ÄìSalam theory (GWS theory) is a triumph and, in certain applications, gives an accuracy on a par with quantum electrodynamics.  Quantum chromodynamics  In the case of the strong interactions, progress concerning their short-distance/high-energy behavior was much slower and more frustrating. For strong interactions with the electro-weak fields, there were difficult issues regarding the strength of coupling, the mass generation of the force carriers as well as their non-linear, self interactions. Although there has been theoretical progress toward a grand unified quantum field theory incorporating the electro-magnetic force, the weak force and the strong force, empirical verification is still pending. Superunification, incorporating the gravitational force, is still very speculative, and is under intensive investigation by many of the best minds in contemporary theoretical physics. Gravitation is a tensor field description of a spin-2 gauge-boson, the \\"graviton\\", and is further discussed in the articles on general relativity and quantum gravity.  Quantum gravity  From the point of view of the techniques of (four-dimensional) quantum field theory, and as the numerous efforts to formulate a consistent quantum gravity theory attests, gravitational quantization has been the reigning champion for bad behavior.Brian Hatfield, Fernando Morinigo, Richard P. Feynman, William Wagner (2002) \\"Feynman Lectures on Gravitation\\", There are technical problems underlain by the fact that the gravitational coupling constant has dimensions involving inverse powers of mass, and, as a simple consequence, it is plagued by perturbatively badly behaved non-linear self-interactions. Gravity is itself a source of gravity, analogously to gauge theories (whose couplings, are, by contrast, dimensionless) leading to uncontrollable divergences at increasing orders of perturbation theory. Moreover, gravity couples to all energy equally strongly, as per the equivalence principle, so this makes the notion of ever really \\"switching-off\\", \\"cutting-off\\" or separating, the gravitational interaction from other interactions ambiguous, since, with gravitation, we are dealing with the very structure of space-time itself. Moreover, it has not been established that a theory of quantum gravity is necessary (see Quantum field theory in curved spacetime).  Contemporary framework of renormalization  Parallel breakthroughs in the understanding of phase transitions in condensed matter physics led to novel insights based on the renormalization group. They involved the work of Leo Kadanoff (1966) and Kenneth Geddes Wilson‚ÄìMichael Fisher (1972)‚Äîextending the work of Ernst Stueckelberg‚ÄìAndr√© Petermann (1953) and Murray Gell-Mann‚ÄìFrancis Low (1954)‚Äîwhich led to the seminal reformulation of quantum field theory by Kenneth Geddes Wilson in 1975. This reformulation provided insights into the evolution of effective field theories with scale, which classified all field theories, renormalizable or not. The remarkable conclusion is that, in general, most observables are \\"irrelevant\\", i.e., the macroscopic physics is dominated by only a few observables in most systems. During the same period, Leo Kadanoff (1969) introduced an operator algebra formalism for the two- dimensional Ising model, a widely studied mathematical model of ferromagnetism in statistical physics. This development suggested that quantum field theory describes its scaling limit. Later, there developed the idea that a finite number of generating operators could represent all the correlation functions of the Ising model. The existence of a much stronger symmetry for the scaling limit of two-dimensional critical systems was suggested by Alexander Belavin, Alexander Markovich Polyakov and Alexander Zamolodchikov in 1984, which eventually led to the development of conformal field theory,Cl√©ment Hongler, Conformal invariance of Ising model correlations, Ph.D. thesis, Universit√© of Geneva, 2010, p. 9. a special case of quantum field theory, which is presently utilized in different areas of particle physics and condensed matter physics. The renormalization group spans a set of ideas and methods to monitor changes of the behavior of the theory with scale, providing a deep physical understanding which sparked what has been called the \\"grand synthesis\\" of theoretical physics, uniting the quantum field theoretical techniques used in particle physics and condensed matter physics into a single powerful theoretical framework. The gauge field theory of the strong interactions, quantum chromodynamics, relies crucially on this renormalization group for its distinguishing characteristic features, asymptotic freedom and color confinement.

Common names for S. vermiculatus include greasewood, seepwood, and saltbush. Traditionally, Sarcobatus has been treated in the family Chenopodiaceae, but the APG III system of 2009 recognizes it as the sole genus in the family Sarcobataceae. Description Sarcobatus vermiculatus Close-up of greasewood, S. vermiculatus The Sarcobatus plants are deciduous shrubs growing to 0.5‚Äì3 m tall with spiny branches and succulent leaves, 10‚Äì40 mm long and 1‚Äì2 mm broad. The leaves are green, in contrast to the grey-green color of most of the other shrubs within its range. The flowers are unisexual, with the male and female flowers on the same plant and appear from June to August. The species reproduces from seeds and sprouts. S. vermiculatus was discovered in 1806 by the Lewis and Clark expedition's westward exploration of North America. Habitat The Sarcobatus area of distribution is western North America, from southeastern British Columbia and southwest Alberta, Canada south through the drier regions of the United States (east to North Dakota and west Texas, west to central Washington and eastern California) to northern Mexico (Coahuila). Both Sarcobatus species are halophytes, usually found in sunny, flat areas around the margins of playas and in dry stream beds and arroyos. It is replaced by iodine bush in extremely saline environments, such as hummocks within the playa itself. Greasewood often grows in extensive, nearly pure stands in pluvial desert locations and is most common on fine-grained soils in areas with a relatively high water table. Uses Although it can be grazed by animals that are adapted, grazing of greasewood by sheep and cattle can result in oxalate poisoning resulting in kidney failure. The active agent can be either sodium oxalate or potassium oxalate. Sheep are the most vulnerable. The wood is yellow, very hard and tough. Because it is so hard, it was used as a shaft for arrows. It was also used as firewood by Native Americans and early settlers. They are used traditionally by Navajo as stirring sticks, √Åd√≠sts√≠√≠n. Taxonomy These plants were formerly treated in the family Chenopodiaceae. The family name Sarcobataceae was published in 1997, and is not recognized by the Flora of North America, which however lists it as a \\"discordant lineage\\" within the larger group of Chenopodiaceae and Amaranthaceae. The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (including the APG III system of 2009), does recognize this family. The family comprises the single genus, Sarcobatus, and is placed in the order Caryophyllales in the clade core eudicots. It was suggested that the plastids and the wood anatomy may show an affinity to Phytolaccaceae and Nyctaginaceae rather than to Chenopodiaceae/Amaranthaceae.

The band was founded in Victoria, British Columbia in 1976 by Jim Palosaari and performed to audiences throughout North America, Europe and Australia for over 12 years. Originally named \\"Higher Ground\\", the group later changed their name to Servant. The lyrics of their songs were known for challenging the Christian Church to turn back to social justice and caring for the poor. A Servant rock concert was like a festival event. The band was known to incorporate comedy and short skits in their sets on stage. Servant was also the first Christian rock group to use laser lights, flame tubes, fireworks, fog machines, in addition to an extensive light show and quadraphonic sound (a precursor to surround-sound). In the early 1980s some critics considered Servant's theatrics, light shows, smoke-bombs and flash-pot stage performances too raucous to be authentically Christian. However, the band's mission was to reach the ears and hearts of those who might not feel so comfortable in church buildings. Shying away from the praise lyrics and easy-listening rock styles that typified most contemporary Christian music at the time, Servant instead attempted to offer edgy, rhythmic, passionate rock and an aggressive stage performance filled with an evangelistic Christian message, and spiced with strong social commentaries. A CCM Magazine review of their 1981 release, Rockin' Revival, stated that the band's lyrics reflected Christian communal subculture, and contained elements of social protest and criticism. Servant toured extensively throughout America, Europe and Australia in concert halls and at music festivals like \\"Creation\\" and \\"Greenbelt\\". They recorded 6 studio albums with songs that ranked in the Top 40 Contemporary Christian Music Charts including \\"Come Jesus Come\\", \\"Holding on to You\\", \\"Thank God\\", \\"We are the Light\\", \\"Surrender\\", \\"Harder to Finish\\", and \\"I Will\\". From 1981 to 1985, opening acts for Servant included Grammy Award-winning Petra, DeGarmo & Key, Joe English (of Paul McCartney & Wings fame), Will McFarlane (recorded with Jackson Browne), Randy Matthews, Jerusalem, and Steve Camp. Petra opened for Servant on tour in late 1981 and early 1982 just as Petra's breakthrough album, Never Say Die was being released. The band reunited to perform a one-off concert at Cornerstone Festival in July 2011. In November 2013, Servant was awarded with the Lifetime Achievement Award from GMA Canada during ceremonies held during the 35th Annual Covenant Awards. On hand to receive the award were band members: Sandie Brock, Owen Brock, Bob Hardy, Rob Martens, Matt Spransy and Eric Odell. Formative years Servant has some origins in 1973 from Lonesome Stone, a Christian rock musical touring Europe billed as a multi-media production of the Jesus generation portrayed in music, film and drama to rival the likes of the musical Godspell. Servant's first song to hit the Top 40 CCM charts, \\"Come Jesus Come\\", was first recorded in 1973 on Lonesome Stone's LP. Lonesome Stone was an outreach of Jesus People Europe, which came out of Jesus People Milwaukee, the latter formed the basis of what eventually became Jesus People USA in Chicago. After Jesus People Europe disbanded, Palosaari and others formed the Highway Missionary Society a year later, based in British Columbia, Canada, with Servant the primary outreach of the Society, based on the West Coast of North America. In 1984 they were renamed The Servant Community in Cincinnati, Ohio.

Biography  N√§slund was born in Sandviken and grew up in the small northern town K√∂pmanholmen, but moved to Gothenburg in 1970 to find work. He was working in the Gothenburg docks when he joined Nynningen, a rock group with leftist political texts and inspired by the Russian Communist poet Mayakovsky. Totta N√§slund became the group's main singer. In the mid-1970s, Nynningen fused with Nationalteatern, a musical theater ensemble with many members. Totta N√§slund joined the group as singer, guitar-player and actor. Nationalteatern developed away from the theater and became a straight rock group, a rock orchestra as they called themselves. Even though Totta never wrote any own songs for the band, he was probably the most prominent member, next to Ulf Dageby. Nationalteatern was one of the many leftist music and theater groups that came together in 1977 to form T√§ltprojektet, The Tent Project, a musical theater performance on the history of the Swedish working class, which toured the country that summer. Totta N√§slund played the Beggar, the central story telling character of the play, and he sang some of the lead songs, like Aldrig mera krig (Never War Again) and Vi √§ro tusenden (We are legion). T√§ltprojekted, a non-profit making experiment financed by its members and supporters, was highly successful. In the beginning of the 1980s, Nationalteatern dissolved and Totta N√§slund directed his full energy to his hobby project, Totta's Bluesband with lyrics in English and several smaller tours in the U.S.. In 1995, when Totta turned 50 years old, he decided to go for a solo career and has released 8 solo albums with mostly songs written directly for him by other artists, or covers of other songs. One of Totta N√§slund's main sources for inspirations was Bob Dylan, and in May 2005 he went to Dylan's hometown Hibbing, Minnesota despite his terminal cancer, where he performed his own interpretation of Bob Dylan songs. Totta had also started making an album together with Mikael Wiehe, with Dylan songs translated to Swedish, but this was interrupted when he suddenly died. Death Totta N√§slund died on 19 June 2005 of liver cancer. He was scheduled to perform in his hometown K√∂pmanholmen the next day. He was 60 years old.

He is best known for his starring role in the early television series The Adventures of Kit Carson, which aired in syndication from 1951 to 1955. Life and career Williams was born in Brooklyn, New York to German immigrant parents. He attended the Pratt Institute, and became a professional swimmer, performing in underwater shows. He landed a walk-on role as a theater usher in King Kong (1933). He enlisted in the United States Army during World War II, but was discharged before the end and became an actor. His credited debut was in The Blue Room in 1944, using the professional name Bill Williams. His first starring role was opposite Susan Hayward in Deadline at Dawn (1946). Williams appeared in ten films before he landed the lead role in television's The Adventures of Kit Carson, which ran for 105 episodes. When the series ended, Williams' star power faded. It was revived in 1957 when he co-starred with Betty White on television in Date with the Angels. Williams portrayed Federal agent Martin Flaherty in The Scarface Mob (1959), the pilot for ABC's The Untouchables. However, when the series was accepted, the role went to Jerry Paris. Williams turned down the lead in Sea Hunt in 1958, believing that an underwater show would not work on television. Lloyd Bridges accepted the part and turned it into a hit. Williams did star as a former Navy frogman in Assignment: Underwater, which ran for just one season. He played a variety of roles on Perry Mason, in which his wife Barbara Hale co-starred as Raymond Burr's secretary Della Street. In a 1962 episode, \\"The Case of the Crippled Cougar,\\" he played defendant Mike Preston. In 1963, he was murder victim Floyd Grant in \\"The Case of the Bluffing Blast.\\" In 1965 Williams played murderer Charles Shaw in \\"The Case of the Murderous Mermaid,\\" and was murderer Burt Payne in \\"The Case of the 12th Wildcat\\". Williams appeared with his son in a final season episode of Ironside, bringing him together again with Raymond Burr.

His music has been released on independent record labels and his catalogue includes work which has found favour amongst DJs and fans from various underground music scenes. Early career Hint's first releases were on the Deep Water label - an imprint based in Leicester in the UK. Shortly after the first promos of his debut EP Beau Selector were circulated amongst DJs, Hint was invited to record a Peel Session at the BBC's Maida Vale Studios, which was broadcast in May 2002. Hint subsequently signed to Bristol-based label Hombre Recordings and began work on his debut album Portakabin Fever. The album was so called because it was written and recorded in a mobile home by James using an Akai MPC, guitar, bass and keyboards. The songs were then mixed with engineer 7-Stu-7 at State of Art - the Bristol-based studio owned by Geoff Barrow of Portishead. Once the album was complete, including cover art and a comic booklet by graphic artist Will Barras, it was released worldwide on 22 April 2003 by Hombre Recordings in association with another, larger independent record label - Ninja Tune. Several of the songs from Portakabin Fever have appeared on television, including uses as incidental music in shows such as Top Gear, C.S.I. Miami and Location, Location, Location and uses in advertising for brands such as Britvic's J2O and Whittaker's Chocolate. To support the release of the album, Hint toured Europe as a DJ with Hexstatic and Pest. At 2003's Big Chill music festival Hint was joined on stage by Bonobo on bass and Minotaur Shock on drums, the trio performing under the banner \\"The Hint Touring Band\\". Both artists also contributed remixes to Hint's track \\"Count Your Blessings\\". From 2004 until 2008 Hint was also a member of the Futureboogie collective, DJing as a resident at their Seen club nights in Bristol and London and regularly contributing to their internet radio shows. Recent career After Hombre Recordings ceased operation, Hint signed to Brighton label Tru Thoughts. Drawing on his love of Drum and Bass, House and Hip Hop, Hint's releases for the label took a more energetic, bass- heavy direction. The release in 2008 of Hint's second album Driven From Distraction saw him collaborate for the first time in the studio with vocalists and other musicians, including (on the song \\"Muddled Morning\\") a 15-year-old MC called Rizzle, who later went on to find success in the group Rizzle Kicks. \\"Snake Patrol\\" also features a recording of actor Gavin Stenhouse playing guitar. Hint has continued to explore a more dancefloor- focused direction with remixes for label mates Belleruche, Flevans, Hot 8 Brass Band and Maddslinky and released his third album, Daily Intake, in 2012.

They opened on 2 November 1959, the same day as the M1, making them the oldest motorway services in Britain. The facilities were originally managed by Blue Boar, a local company that had run a nearby petrol station before the M1 opened. Roadchef bought the services from Blue Boar in 1995. The main building was designed by Harry Weedon, the architect for Odeon Cinemas, while the layout and general buildings were designed by coordinating architect Owen Williams. The main building was not ready on opening, so food was served from temporary sheds. The restaurant opened in September 1960, but due to the site's reputation as a truck stop, was redesigned in 1964 to accommodate a waitress service. The services became a meeting place for rock bands in the 1960s, including the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd and Jimi Hendrix, as it provided a convenient place to sit down and eat a meal in the early hours of the morning. In the 1970s, the quality of the services declined and the food came in for harsh criticism from journalists and artists, such as Roy Harper. Since purchase in 1995, Roadchef have refurbished the premises. They have promoted its history, including the association with a north / south divide, and its regular use by 1960s rock musicians. A number of events took place to celebrate the 50th anniversary in November 2009, including a musical about the services. The services are named after the nearby Watford Gap, a crossing point of the limestone ridge just north of the village of Watford; the name is unrelated to that of the town of Watford in Hertfordshire. Watford Gap is considered by some to be on a dividing line that separates the north and the south of England. Location The services are in Northamptonshire, England close to the village of Watford about to the south east of Rugby and about to the north west of London. They are situated between junctions 16 and 17 of the M1 with a single site for each direction on the motorway linked by a footbridge. The name comes from the nearby Watford Gap, the narrowest and lowest point in the limestone ridge that crosses England diagonally from the Cotswolds to Lincoln Edge. In Roman Britain, Iter II, later named Watling Street, crossed the gap; Thomas Telford considered the route unsuitable for coach traffic due to the presence of quicksand. Today, this is reflected in the modern road network by the A5 suddenly turning left towards Kilsby near the services. Similarly, the Grand Union Canal (which runs immediately behind the northbound vehicle park) avoided the gap by the Crick Tunnel. Consequently, the Roman Road at Watford Gap was largely untouched by previous engineering works when the M1 was constructed, and the engineers were able to build over it. In popular culture, the Watford Gap is often considered to be a dividing line that separates the north and the south of England. The phrase \\"north of the Watford gap\\" may be shortened to \\"north of Watford\\", inviting confusion with the larger town of Watford further south in Hertfordshire. Roadchef have suggested that the services' name should be included in the Oxford English Dictionary as an expression of the divide between the north and south. History The M1 and Watford Gap Services in 1961 The services, the first of its kind in the UK, opened at the same time as the new motorway on 2 November 1959. They evolved from discussions during 1955 and 1956 by the Ministry of Transport over what facilities should be present on new motorways. Civil engineer Owen Williams visited the United States to see what existing rest areas were available, and based his designs on these. Watford Gap was chosen as one of four pilot sites, though by 1958 the Ministry had decided only this and Newport Pagnell services would open with the motorway. The land on which the services were built belonged to the Thorntons of Brock Hall, who had owned the manor since 1625. The family had previously attempted to block the Grand Union Canal and the main London ‚Äì Birmingham railway across the gap, without success. Brock Hall was eventually sold in 1969 and converted into flats. The structure was built on the site of derelict farm buildings. There were different designers for different parts of the service area, with Owen Williams as the coordinating architect. An ornate design for a footbridge by Clough Williams-Ellis was rejected in favour of a more functional and conservative modernist design by Owen Williams. When the services opened the new buildings were incomplete so the food was served from temporary sheds. The original plan had been for trucks to use this service station and for cars to use Newport Pagnell. In practice, however, both service areas were unrestricted. The first owners of the services were Blue Boar Limited, a family company that owned a nearby petrol station on the A5. Although the official name has always been Watford Gap, the services were colloquially called Blue Boar for some time after opening. The original buildings at Watford Gap were designed by Harry W Weedon and Partners, already well known for their work for Odeon Cinemas. The restaurant opened in September 1960, but the Ministry were unhappy about the services' reputation as a truck-stop, dating back to Blue Boar's popularity with HGV drivers. They consequently redesigned the restaurant in 1964 to accommodate a waitress service, which they hoped would \\"lose at least some of the stigma of having been started in 1959 as primarily a commercial driver's facility\\". Food was criticised for being expensive, though Tam Galbraith disputed this, noting he could buy steak and kidney pie with chips, buttered roll and a cup of tea at Watford Gap for 4s 2d (¬£ today). By the 1970s, a combination of the recession, overpriced food, and fear of football hooligans had greatly reduced the services' popularity. The quality of the food declined substantially and, because of its prominent location, the services became a byword for poor catering. Roy Harper wrote a song criticising the food at the Watford Gap on his 1977 album, Bullinamingvase, writing: \\"Watford Gap, Watford Gap / A plate of grease and a load of crap\\". The owners of Watford Gap service station objected to criticism of their food, as did an EMI board member who was also a non-executive director of Blue Boar. Harper defended his decision to write the song, claiming the food was \\"junk. Absolute junk\\". In 1989, one journalist claimed the services had some of the worst food found on the road network, adding \\"if I threw the toast out of the window, it would probably still be bouncing up the M1.\\" Roadchef purchased the motorway businesses from Blue Boar in 1995 and have since improved facilities. In 2011 and 2012 it was rated as 3 stars by quality assessors at Visit England. Roadchef celebrated the services' 50th anniversary on 2 November 2009 by selling cups of tea at 1959 prices. A road sign was erected pointing to \\"The North\\" and \\"The South\\" on the same day. As part of the anniversary celebrations, local film-maker and composer Benjamin Till created a musical about Watford Gap. The show featured stories from eighty people who had worked or been associated with the services, including local residents who remembered the services opening. Notable visitors Though the Ministry of Transport was adamant that the services should not be destinations in their own right, they did acquire a reputation for being a popular place for motorists to visit. During the 1960s, the services were a regular stopping venue for bands such as Pink Floyd and the Rolling Stones. The Beatles stopped at Watford Gap while travelling from Liverpool to gigs in the south in the early stage of their career. Jimi Hendrix heard so much about \\"Blue Boar\\", as the services were then popularly known, that he thought it was a London nightclub. Gerry Marsden, leader of the Pacemakers regularly visited the services when touring, saying it was good for \\"a quick stop and a quick nosh.\\" The Floyd's Nick Mason recalls Hendrix stopping off at the services at 2am, while The Zombies' Chris White thought the services were \\"the feeding trough of the beat boom\\". Harper claimed \\"everybody would meet at Watford Gap because it was the one place after a show where you were guaranteed a bit of a sit-down at 2am\\". The services' association with 1960s musicians is remembered in a set of photographs published in 2008 of the Stones stopping at Watford Gap on the way to ATV Studios, Birmingham in 1963. In 2009, Roadchef paid a former employee ¬£1,000 for autographs he had collected while working there, including those of Paul McCartney, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Brian Jones, Dusty Springfield and Cliff Richard. In July 2011, music journalist Peter Paphides presented Late Nights at the Blue Boar, a BBC Radio 4 documentary about the connection between the services and Britain's 1960s rock bands.

In the 1990s, he won New Zealand Cartoonist of the Year six times, and won the award again in 2009. Biography Scott was born in London in 1947 and emigrated to New Zealand with his family as an 18-month-old. He was raised at Rongotea in rural Manawatu, and studied at Massey University, graduating with a Bachelor of Science in physiology in 1972. Scott has been a regular cartoonist for most of his career; initially for the New Zealand Listener magazine, between 1984 and 1987 for the Auckland Star, and then for the Evening Post newspaper and its successor the Dominion Post. As a satirist, newspaper columnist and cartoonist, Scott often provokes New Zealand politicians and at one stage was banned from the press contingent for a considerable period of time by Prime Minister Robert Muldoon, which naturally resulted in continuing astringent expressions in the press by Scott. He later said of Muldoon: \\"I believe that much of the sourness, depression and division that currently besets our country can be laid at the feet of one man - Robert David Muldoon... he has made intolerance and prejudice, if not fashionable then at least permissible.\\"Rights of passage : beyond the New Zealand identity crisis, Chris Laidlaw,Hodder Moa Beckett, 1999, p. 102 Scott has won numerous awards, including the Qantas Awards for New Zealand Cartoonist of the Year (seven times), Columnist of the Year, and Political Columnist of the Year (three times). He also won scriptwriting awards for Fallout and for View from the Top. Scott co-wrote the screenplay for the animated feature Footrot Flats: The Dog's Tale with Murray Ball. In 2001 Scott wrote the semi-autobiographical stage play, about his father, The Daylight Atheist which has since been performed by numerous theatres in New Zealand and Australia. He followed up his father's story with a play about his mother, Joan, in 2018. In the 2006 New Year Honours, Scott was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services as a writer, journalist and illustrator. In 2011, Scott produced the 1981 Springbok Tour TV drama Rage, shown as the final of four parts of the Sunday Theatre season on TV One on 4 September 2011. The series was a ratings winner. In March 2019 Scott left the Dominion Post to pursue a project to write a biography of Charles Upham, which was published in 2020.

These are defined by U.S. military standard (MIL-STD) 6016. It is used by the U.S. Navy, U.S. Army, U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Coast Guard, the NSA, several NATO countries, and Japan as part of the Multi-Tactical Data Link Network, a Tactical Data Link. TADIL J was designed as an improved data link used to exchange near real-time (NRT) information. It is a communication, navigation, and identification system that supports information exchange between tactical command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence (C4I) systems. The radio transmission and reception component of TADIL J is the Joint Tactical Information Distribution System (JTIDS) or its successor, the Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS). These high-capacity, ultra high frequency (UHF), line of sight (LOS), frequency-hopping data communications terminals provide secure, jam-resistant voice and digital data exchange. JTIDS/MIDS terminals operate on the principle of time division multiple access (TDMA), wherein time slots are allocated among all TADIL J network participants for the transmission and reception of data. TDMA eliminates the requirement for a net control station (NCS) by providing a nodeless communications network architecture.\\"Simulation Activities using Gateway and Tactical Digital Information Links\\" http://www.dtic.mil/cgi- bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA460117 Other TADILs included TADIL-A, TADIL-B, and TADIL-C, which were known by NATO as Link 11, Link 11B, and Link 4 respectively.

The station is situated between the World Trade Center and the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center; it also serves Commonwealth Pier and nearby residential and commercial development. Like all Silver Line stations, World Trade Center station is accessible. History The station headhouse on World Trade Center Avenue World Trade Center station was designed by G plus G Architects. Its mezzanine level is intended to resemble an underwater environment with a blue-lit wavy ceiling and sand-colored stone tiles with mica flecks. Lenticular art designed by Marybeth Mungovan and Jason Asselin is installed on the lobby level of the station. The station has entrances from two different street levels: ground-level Congress Street and the elevated World Trade Center Avenue. Because of the configuration of Massachusetts Turnpike exit ramps, inbound SL1 and SL3 buses stop at the station twice: once on Congress Street, then again at the underground platforms after entering the tunnel at Silver Line Way. World Trade Center station opened along with the rest of the South Boston Piers Transitway from South Station to Silver Line Way on December 17, 2004. Through service on the SL2 and SL3 routes serving the Design Center and City Point areas began on December 31, 2004, followed by SL1 service on June 1, 2005. Inbound SL1 (and since 2018, SL3) buses also stop on Congress Street outside the station before entering the Waterfront Tunnel at Silver Line Way. The original SL3 service was discontinued on March 20, 2009. In early April 2018, construction on a nearby building caused spalling on a concrete column at World Trade Center, closing the station for a day.

Beddington Cross operated London Buses routes 3, 152, 157, 434, G1, P13, and night route N3, and was opened by Connex in 2000 to house their newly won route 3. Queenstown operated routes 35, 156, 211, 452, C3, 24-hour route 344 and night route N35. Walworth Road operated routes 40, 100, 129, 188, 343, 381, C1, night routes N343 and N381. Originally a site acquired by the London County Council for its electric trams, it was known as Camberwell Tram depot until 1950 when its name was changed to Walworth with the arrival of buses. This was to avoid confusion with Camberwell Garage located opposite the Walworth garage. Major rebuilding took place during the 1950s to repair bomb damage from the World War II during which time some buses were worked out of Camberwell. In the late 1960s the garage assumed operation of the Red Arrow routes with MBAs and later LSs until its closure in 1985. Following the closure of the Victoria and Ash Grove garages, from 1987 Walworth operated the Red Arrow routes for a short time until the Waterloo garage was ready. During the early 1990s the garage once again re-opened, this time for the Londonlinks operation of routes 78 and 176. The Cowie Group undertook a major restructure a few years later which once again saw closure of Walworth garage in 1997. The garage was owned by the Go-Ahead Group and they leased it out. The garage lay dormant for the next six years until late 2003 when work started on refurbishing the garage for Travel London, who needed more garage space after some contract wins including routes 381, 452 and N381.Bus tender results Route 381/N381 Transport for London 15 March 2004Bus tender results Route 452 Transport for London 3 May 2006 Travel London won the contract for route 407, starting from 31 October 2009.

It was first described by French botanist Viguier in 1814In: Histoire naturelle, m√©dicale et √©conomique des pavots et arg√©mones, Montpellier, 1814 who named it as poppy-like (from Greek mekon poppy, opsis alike). The species have attractive flowers and have two distinct ranges. The 40 or so (depending on classification) species are found in the Himalayas. Within the Himalayan types there is much debate as to what constitutes a particular species as many readily hybridise with each other and produce viable seed. It is likely that some individually named species are in fact a single species but with an under-appreciated morphological diversity. A large proportion of species are monocarpic and as such are notoriously difficult to maintain in cultivation. Meconopsis gakyidiana - the national flower of Bhutan Meconopsis grandis, known as the blue poppy, was thought to be the national flower of Bhutan. However, in 2017, after three years of study conducted by the National Biodiversity Centre, Bhutan, and the Blue Poppy Society in Japan (Note: There is no history of the Blue Poppy Society in Japan.) it was found that the national flower of Bhutan was misidentified as Meconopsis grandis. Meconopsis grandis is not found in Bhutan and the earlier Blue Poppy was named based on specimens collected in 1933. Through field experience and studies, the National Biodiversity Centre noticed the differences. A new species was discovered and it was given a Dzongkha name ‚ÄòGakyid (‡Ωë‡ΩÇ‡Ω†‡ºã‡Ω¶‡æê‡æ±‡Ω≤‡Ωë)‚Äô. The name was inspired by the concept of Gross National Happiness. So the new species is named as Meconopsis gakyidiana Another two new species of blue poppy were also discovered in addition to the national flower of Bhutan. They are named as Meconopsis merakensis and Meconopsis elongata. The new species can be found in Merak (‡Ωò‡Ω∫‡ºã‡Ω¢‡ΩÇ), Sagteng (‡Ω¶‡ΩÇ‡ºã‡Ω¶‡æü‡Ω∫‡ΩÑ‡ºã) and Haa (‡Ωß‡Ω±) regions in Bhutan. In the late spring of 1922, a British Himalayan expedition, led by legendary mountaineer George Leigh Mallory, discovered the plant on their failed attempt to reach the summit of the then-unconquered Mount Everest. The flowers were introduced to much excitement at the Royal Horticultural Society's spring show of 1926. However, since they are difficult to grow, the species has become fabled over the decades. In 2009, horticulturalist and author Bill Terry published his \\"gardening memoir\\", Blue Heaven, about the plant. Blue poppies do not produce opium. Cultivation Himalayan varieties have the reputation for being difficult to grow from seed, but when germinating new plants, using fresh seeds will help. These plants are available in a variety of strong colours, including blue, red, orange, purple, white and yellow depending on species and cultivar. =Pests and Diseases= In the United Kingdom, Meconopsis has been affected by the invasive golden root mealybug. Damping off may occur on seedling grown plants.

The album was recorded and produced by Kristoffer Rygg and Tore Ylwizaker, mixed by Ylwizaker at Beep Jam Studio and mastered by Audun Strype at Strype Audio. Perdition City continues the experimentation heard on Themes from William Blake's The Marriage of Heaven and Hell and Metamorphosis, containing elements of trip hop, jazz, ambient music, spoken word and electronica, the combination being described as \\"moody\\", \\"atmospheric\\", and \\"cinematic in scope\\". The album received positive reviews upon release, with Kerrang! noting, \\"This ain't rock 'n roll. This is evolution on such a grand scale that most bands wouldn't even be able to wrap their tiny little minds around it.\\" Background The Metamorphosis EP, issued in September 1999, showcased Ulver's new electronic sound, delving into what would become the foundation for all future records, Now consisting of only two members ‚Äî Rygg and Ylwizaker ‚Äî the duo started to incorporate field recordings into their work. During the making of Perdition City Ylwizaker would hang microphones outside the window of his 5th floor apartment to capture the sounds of the inner city streets. Subtitled \\"Music to an Interior Film\\", Perdition City, and companion EP‚Äôs Silence Teaches You How to Sing and Silencing the Singing, represent the transition to the band's work in film scores, largely inspired by the results of electronic programming and digital sound manipulation they had experimented with during the recording of Themes from William Blake's The Marriage of Heaven and Hell. In response to the subtitle, Rygg adds, \\"We mean just what we say, an abstract \\"inner movie\\". It wouldn't be wise to comment on anything afterwards in case there would be a hidden message.\\" Leonards Lair state that Perdition City is ‚Äúmuch more than background music, which is capable of adding atmosphere to a film, but taken out of context as a standalone piece is ultimately worthless. This music is too obtrusive, and to be frank, too good for a soundtrack.‚Äú Expanding on the photography included in the Perdition City booklet, Rygg comments, \\"We didn't consciously think of taking the listener into a concrete city, it's more of a metaphor and abstract. A friend of mine who has written books and taken many photographs inspired me to capture weird pictures. We then compiled the best of them to support the story the lyrics make. We tried to make an anti- aesthetic whole that would create a documentary feeling.\\" Printed in the sleeve note is states: \\"This is for the stations before and after sleep. Headphones and darkness recommended.\\" Rygg adds, ‚ÄúDarkness is always fascinating, as well as the great void. It doesn‚Äôt matter under which aesthetic circumstances this void appears. It is always there and that was important for us to realize on Perdition City: the void is even over the voice. (‚Ä¶) It is funny you call us criminal alchemists. Indeed in our lyrics there are enough criminal and alchemical aspects, or fascinating borderline topics, to be more concrete. That all takes place in the dead city, or better: in a centre, an imagined location of nowhere and nothing.‚Äù Rygg, commenting in Unrestrained magazine in 2007, said, \\"It's like I say, we only have three consistent albums. I think Nattens madrigal is one, I think Perdition City is one, and I think this new one [Shadows of the Sun]. They all sound pretty dead set. We were heavily into stuff like Amon Tobin, Warp Records, et cetera, and that certainly influenced the sound of that one.\\" Continuing, ‚Äú[Making film soundtracks] was more painstaking work than we thought. It's exciting work, but it's also more commercially orientated. You can apply your own tastes and your own vision, of course, but only to a certain extent. It always comes down to what the director and producers have in mind. And I respect that, as they are the ones with lots of money at stake. As a musician, it's an advantage if you get involved early in the process, before the editing is done because then you can cross edit sounds and images for better momentum or what have you. Whereas if the stuff is already edited, it can be difficult to get it to fit. Also, you have to learn to put your ego aside because the film itself is obviously the priority, so it's not like making an album. It's not music on its own terms. It's an underscore, aimed more at the subconscious experience. In a cinema context, you're not really supposed to listen to the music, but feel it.\\" Critical reception Writing for AllMusic, William York commented positively, ‚ÄúFifth album, Perdition City is an album of moody, atmospheric electronica, built up around basic down-tempo beats and noir-ish electronic piano harmonies, and then fleshed out with various blips and bleeps, static noises, samples, and occasional vocals.‚Äù Additionally, Johnathan Hill highlighted the album's \\"jazz-tinged\\" moments, noting that the \\"rich and varied instrumental passages\\" allowed for a greater level of depth to the band's musical explorations. Conversely, David M. Pecoraro from Pitchfork rated the album 2.6/10 and declared, ‚ÄúWho knows? Maybe Perdition City was nothing more than a well-intentioned but ultimately ill-advised experiment for these guys. Ulver might want to consider a return to their metal roots.‚Äù Track listing \\"Catalept\\" is a remix of Prelude from the film Psycho.

He was one of the Hollywood Ten who were jailed in 1950 for their 1947 refusal to testify before the US Congress about their alleged involvement with the Communist Party USA. They and many other US entertainment industry figures were subsequently blacklisted, which denied Maltz employment in the industry for many years.

Born into an affluent Jewish family, in Brooklyn, New York, Maltz was educated at Columbia University, where he was a member of Zeta Beta Tau fraternity and the class of 1930,\\"Zeta Beta Tau,\\" Columbian, 1930, page 410, U.S. School Yearbooks, 1880-2012 database. and the Yale School of Drama. He became a communist in 1935 out of conviction, later telling an interviewer: \\"I also read the Marxist classics. I still think it to be the noblest set of ideals ever penned by man.... Where else in political literature do you find thinkers saying that we were going to end all forms of human exploitation? Wage exploitation, exploitation of women by men, the exploitation of people of colour by white peoples, the exploitation of colonial countries by imperialist countries. And Marx spoke of the fact that socialism will be the kingdom of freedom, where man realizes himself in a way that humankind has never seen before. This was an inspiring body of literature to read.\\"\\"Albert Maltz.\\" Spartacus Educational. Although Maltz later learned of and criticized Soviet repression, one 2009 analysis maintains, \\"he remained sympathetic to the anti- fascism of both the Soviet Union and the CPUSA during the 1930s,\\" saying in a 1983 interview \\"the Communist party in the United States was leading the educational and organizational struggle.\\"Maltz, Albert (interview by Joel Gardner). \\"The Citizen Writer in Retrospect,\\" Oral History Program, University of California, Los Angeles, 1983, 308‚Äì20. Cited in Sbardellati 2009. =Ostracism within the CPUSA and recantation= In February 1946 Maltz published an article (written in October 1945) for The New Masses titled \\"What Shall We Ask of Writers?\\"Maltz, Albert. \\"What shall we ask of writers?\\", The New Masses, 12 February 1946, pages 19-22. in which he criticized fellow Communist writers for producing lower-quality work, owing to their placing political concerns above artistic ones. He also referred positively in his article to the work of James T. Farrell, a Trotskyist. This article brought upon Maltz venomous attacks from fellow CPUSA members,Burnett, Colin. \\"The 'Albert Maltz Affair' and the Debate over Para-Marxist Formalism in New Masses, 1945‚Äì1946\\" (abstract), Journal of American Studies, 14 May 2013. both in print and in person at party meetings. He was accused of \\"Browderism\\" and in order to retain his good standing with the party he had to humiliate himself by publishing in the Daily Worker a rebuttal of his own article. Furthermore, he \\"publicly denounced himself onstage at a writer's symposium chaired by party members.\\" Nearly 30 years after Maltz's death, the 'Albert Maltz Affair' still was a subject of discussion among scholars of Marxist movements and of the Hollywood Ten. John Sbardellati of the University of Waterloo argued in the journal Cold War History that \\"by reigning [sic] in Albert Maltz, the Party rejected its earlier, more accommodating approach to popular culture, and in doing so, unwittingly forfeited a large measure of its cultural influence\\" and that this shift contributed to the rapid decline of \\"social problem films\\" that had emerged early in the post-war era (p. 489). Writing in the Journal of American Studies, Colin Burnett argues, \\"The immediate attacks on Maltz by critics like Mike Gold were motivated primarily by the view that a properly Marxist aesthetics must follow the Leninist‚ÄìZhdanovite theory of 'art as a weapon',\\" though Burnett proposes \\"a reexamination of the 'para-Marxist' theory of art [Maltz] developed to clarify the role of leftist criticism and the 'citizen writer' ... in light of debates about art and literature in the journal New Masses (1926‚Äì48), as well as in international Marxist aesthetics.\\" Career During the 1930s, Maltz worked as a playwright for the Theater Union, which was \\"an organization of theater artists and [pro-Communist] political activists who mounted professional productions of plays oriented towards working people and their middle-class allies.\\" In 1932, his play Merry Go Round was adapted for a film. At the Theater Union he met Margaret Larkin (1899‚Äì1967), whom he married in 1937. Subscription required. He won the O.

While still pursuing his career as a writer of published fiction and stage drama, he branched out into writing for the screen. After working on Casablanca, Maltz's first screenwriting credit was for This Gun for Hire (1942). For his script for the 1945 film Pride of the Marines, Maltz was nominated for an Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay.

Academy Awards, USA, 1951 However, due to his blacklisting at the time, fellow MPAA screenwriter Michael Blankfort agreed to put his own name on the script in place of Maltz'sAP. \\"Blacklisted screenwriter at last gets credit for 'Broken Arrow',\\" San Francisco Chronicle, 4 July 1991, page E5. as the only way to get it accepted by any of the Hollywood movie studios, and as such, Blankfort was named the winner. His last assignment for some years was The Robe (1953), although he didn't receive a credit until decades later. During the early years of the blacklisting, Maltz continued as a published writer of fiction. A 1949 Frank X. Tolbert review of Maltz's The Journey of Simon McKeever notes that the author's notoriety likely will lead the book to be \\"read keenly and even X-rayed to see if it might furnish a clue to the question the writer wouldn't answer.\\"Tolbert, Frank X. \\"Books in the news: sterling novel scans problems of the aged,\\" The Dallas Morning News, 16 May 1949, page 2. Praising the novel as a \\"beautiful\\" novel and \\"an eloquent criticism of the way we treat our old people\\" in the form of a \\"stream of consciousness story about a few days in the life of a 73-year-old arthritic in a rest home on a $60 pension,\\" a man who \\"has made good wages all his life\\" but is \\"too generous to have saved any money,\\" living in an old-age home Tolbert describes as \\"like something Charles Dickens would have cooked up if he were a twentieth-century author\\" -- Tolbert concludes that \\"if [this book] is 'un-American' in its philosophy, then so are the doctrines of old Doc Townsend and most of the other pension planners.\\" In 1960, years after appearing in The House I Live In, Sinatra engaged him to write a screenplay for The Execution of Private Slovik. The decision led to considerable public pressure on Sinatra, including an incident in which popular conservative actor John Wayne publicly challenged presidential hopeful John F. Kennedy, then a senator for Massachusetts, as to whether he approved of his \\"crony\\" Sinatra's choice, stating that Kennedy's opinion mattered \\"because Mr. Kennedy is the one who is making plans to run the administrative government of our country.\\"UPI. \\"Star asks Kennedy state stand on Red list,\\"The Dallas Morning News, 23 March 1960, page 7. In the same article, Ward Bond disparaged Sinatra and others who employed blacklisted writers as \\"members of the recent trend of what might be called a 'Hire the Commies' Club.\\" Sinatra initially parried attempts to persuade him to fire Maltz, stating that the writer was hired \\"because he was the best man for the job -- it had nothing to do with his politics,\\", but in the end Sinatra was pressured into dismissing Maltz from the project, with columnist Dorothy Kilgallen crediting chiefly the intervention of Kennedy's father, Joe -- \\"unquestionably anti-Communist, Dad Kennedy would have invited Frank to jump off the Jack Kennedy presidential bandwagon if he hadn't unloaded Maltz\\" --,Kilgallen, Dorothy. \\"Voice of Broadway: Joe Kennedy credited for Sinatra's decision,\\" Fort Worth Star-Telegram, 16 April 1960, page 9. although she also noted that Col. Parker \\"was on the verge of pulling Elvis off the upcoming Sinatra spectacular if there was any chance of guilt by association.\\"Kilgallen, Dorothy. \\"Voice of Broadway\\" (column), Fort Worth Star-Telegram, 24 April 1960, section 2, page 15. Maltz and other members of the Hollywood Ten attempted again in 1960 to fight the blacklist, this time by filing an anti- trust suit claiming the studios had conspired illicitly in restraint of trade by enforcing the unofficial blacklist through mutual pressure not to employ the affected creative personnel.Schumach, Murray (NYT News Service). \\"Movie group sues to destroy blacklist,\\" The Dallas Morning News, 30 December 1960, page 2: \\"Every major movie producing company in Hollywood has been named by a group of writers and actors in a suit to destroy a political blacklist in the movie industry allegedly maintained since 1947.\\" Coverage of the suit noted that the plaintiffs \\"include three winners of Oscars, the highest artistic award of the movie industry\\" -- at least two of which were won for pseudonymous writing (The Defiant Ones and Inherit the Wind are named) -- and that while use of the anti-trust laws for civil rights suits was \\"unusual,\\" it was \\"not unique.\\"  Post-blacklist career and credits  Maltz was finally employed again on Two Mules for Sister Sara (1970), which was a vehicle for the popular actors Clint Eastwood and Shirley MacLaine. He worked on additional screenwriting projects in his later years, not all of which came to fruition; a 1972 article on Martin Rackin notes his intention to film a Modigliani biography he co-wrote with Maltz,Payne, William A. \\"Rackin advice on luring films,\\" The Dallas Morning News, 18 July 1972, page 10A. while a 1978 Henry Fonda profile indicates his plans to revive a script of Maltz's The Journey of Simon McKeever, previously set to star Walter Huston but shelved due to the blacklist, then revived for Spencer Tracy but abandoned when the star died before shooting began.Glover, William (AP). \\"Henry Fonda: Acting's grand old guard still going strong,\\" The Dallas Morning News, 22 October 1978, page 1C. Fonda said in a separate interview, \\"When it was brought to me, I fell in love with the story. Jane heard me talking enthusiastically about it, and she asked to read the script. 'Dad, I'd like to play the doctor'... you know she must like it, because her role is small -- she'll work only four days.\\"Thomas, Bob (AP). \\"Henry Fonda still harvesting his talent at the age of 74,\\" Fort Worth Star-Telegram, 21 March 1979, page 16A. Although the project at that time had advanced to the point that filming locations convenient to Henry Fonda's beekeeping hobby had been identified, the film never was made.McKinney, Devin. \\"The damned hurt: Albert Maltz's The Journey of Simon McKeever, Critics at Large, 4 January 2014. Maltz's last writing credit (as John B. Sherry) is for Hangup (1974). In 1991, in the course of correcting screen credits for blacklisted screenwriters, the Writers Guild of America officially recognized Maltz as the only credited screenwriter for Broken Arrow. The guild's vote was unanimous. One of Maltz's literary agents was Maxim Lieber, whom he visited in Warsaw, Poland, after Lieber fled the States in 1950. Maltz referred to him as \\"my friend and former agent.\\" In his later years, Maltz reached out to others outside the United States, once offering to take any royalties owed him by the Soviet Union and give them to Russian writer Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn to alleviate the dire conditions then being imposed on him by the USSR. Solzhenitsyn expressed his appreciation via the press, observing that Soviet authorities were unlikely to allow him to accept the offer and disputing Soviet cultural minister Furtseva's claims that the Russian author was \\"well off and has bought more than one car,\\" insisting instead that for the seven years previous the Soviet government had denied him both money and housing, such that, \\"My only car, which I had been using for nine years, was sold to prolong my existence and I have not gotten any other car.\\"AP. \\"'Touched' by offer, Solzhenitsyn says,\\" Fort Worth Star-Telegram, 18 December 1972, page 35.

In an interview given a few weeks after Maltz's death, actor Kirk Douglas -- who claimed to have broken the blacklist by publicly hiring Trumbo in 1959 to improve the Spartacus script -- said of the 10, \\"I felt badly about those people. They weren't trying to overthrow their government. I didn't share their beliefs, any more than I am in sympathy with the opinions of Vanessa Redgrave. But I support her suit against the Boston Symphony [for cancelling 1982 performances based on Redgrave's support of the Palestine Liberation Organization].

The 'Dillo flourished from 1970 to 1980. The structure that housed it, an old National Guard Armory, was demolished in 1981 and replaced by a 13-story office building. History Eddie Wilson in 2017 In 1970, Austin's flagship rock music venue, the Vulcan Gas Company, closed, leaving the city's nascent and burgeoning live music scene without an incubator. One night, Eddie Wilson, manager of the local group Shiva's Headband, stepped outside a nightclub where the band was playing and noticed an old, abandoned National Guard armory. Wilson found an unlocked garage door on the building and was able to view the cavernous interior using the headlights of his automobile. He had a desire to continue the legacy of the Vulcan Gas Company, and was inspired by what he saw in the armory to create a new music hall in the derelict structure. The armory was estimated to have been built in 1948, but no records of its construction could be or have been located. The building was ugly, uncomfortable, and had poor acoustics, but offered cheap rent and a central location. Posters for the venue usually noted the address as 525¬Ω Barton Springs Road (Rear), behind the Skating Palace (approximate coordinates 30.258 ‚àí97.750). The name for the Armadillo was inspired by the use of armadillos as a symbol in the artwork of Jim Franklin, a local poster artist, and from the building itself. In choosing the mascot for the new venture, Wilson and his partners wanted an \\"armored\\" animal since the building was an old armory. The nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus) was chosen because of its hard shell that looks like armor, its history as a survivor (virtually unchanged for almost 50 million years), and its near-ubiquity in Central Texas. Wilson also believed the building looked like it had been some type of headquarters at one time. He initially proposed \\"International Headquarters\\" but in the end it became \\"World Headquarters.\\" In founding the Armadillo World Headquarters, Wilson was assisted by Jim Franklin, Mike Tolleson (n√© Robert Michael Tolleson; born 1942), an entertainment attorney licensed by the State Bar of Texas in 1968, Bobby Hedderman from the Vulcan Gas Company and Hank Alrich. Funding for the venture was initially provided by Shiva's Headband founder's father, Dan Perskin, and Mad Dog, Inc. an Austin literati group that included Bud Shrake. The Armadillo World Headquarters officially opened on August 7, 1970, with Shiva's Headband, the Hub City Movers, and Whistler performing. (de)graphic artist) The Armadillo caught on quickly with the hippie culture of Austin because admission was inexpensive and the hall tolerated cannabis use. Even though illicit drug use was flagrant, the Armadillo was never raided. Anecdotes suggest the police were worried about having to bust their fellow officers as well as local and state politicians. Frank Zappa at the Armadillo World Headquarters, September 13, 1977(Mark Steven Estabrook, photo) Soon, the Armadillo started receiving publicity in national magazines such as Rolling Stone. In a story from its September 9, 1974, edition, Time magazine wrote that the Armadillo was to the Austin music scene what The Fillmore had been to the emergence of rock music in the 1960s. The clientele became a mixture of hippies, cowboys, and businessmen who stopped by to have lunch and a beer and listen to live music. As Gary Nunn put it, \\"It's been said that our music was the catalyst that brought the shit-kickers and the hippies together at the Armadillo.\\" At its peak, the amount of Lone Star draft beer sold by the Armadillo was second only to the Houston Astrodome. The Neiman Marcus department store even offered a line of Armadillo-branded products. The unique blend of country and rock music performed at the hall became known by the terms \\"The Austin Sound,\\" \\"Redneck Rock,\\" progressive country or \\"Cosmic Cowboy.\\" Artists that almost single-handedly defined this particular genre and sound were Michael Martin Murphey, Jerry Jeff Walker and The Lost Gonzo Band. Many upcoming and established acts such as Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, Ray Charles, Stevie Ray Vaughan and ZZ Top played the Armadillo. Freddy Fender, Freddie King, Frank Zappa, Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen, The Sir Douglas Quintet all recorded live albums there. Bruce Springsteen played five shows during 1974. The Australian band AC/DC played their first American show at the Armadillo with Canadian band Moxy in July 1977. The Clash played live at The Armadillo with Joe Ely on October 4, 1979 (a photo from that show appears on the band's London Calling album) and the notorious Austin punk band The Skunks. Despite its successes, the Armadillo always struggled financially. The addition of the Armadillo Beer Garden in 1972 and the subsequent establishment of food service were both bids to generate steady cash flow. However, the financial difficulties continued. In an interview for the 2010 book Weird City, Eddie Wilson remarked: > \\"People don't remember this part: the months and months of drudgery. People > talk about the Armadillo like it was a huge success, but there were months > where hardly anyone showed up. After the first night when no one really came > I ended up crying myself to sleep up on stage.\\" This predicament was blamed on a combination of large guaranteed payments for the acts, cheap ticket prices, and poor promotion. The club finally had to lay off staff members in late 1976 and file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1977. Another factor in the club's demise was that it sat on of land in what soon became a prime development area in the rapidly growing city. The Armadillo's landlord sold the property for an amount estimated between $4 million and $8 million. The final concert at the Armadillo took place on December 31, 1980. The sold-out New Year's Eve show featured Asleep at the Wheel and Commander Cody and the Lost Planet Airmen. Some reports say the show ended at 4 am, while others claim that the bands played until dawn. The contents of the Armadillo were sold at auction in January 1981, and the old armory was razed for a high-rise office building.

The bazaar began as a collaboration to give indoor space to artisan vendors who sold their wares at the Austin Renaissance Market on 23rd Street, near the University of Texas campus ‚Äì and at the same time, improve cash flow for the hall. When the Armadillo permanently closed, the bazaar moved to Cherry Creek Plaza (1981‚Äì1983) and then on to the Austin Opry House at 200 Academy Drive (1984‚Äì1994). In 1995, the bazaar settled for twelve years at the Austin Music Hall, 208 Nueces Street at Third Street. Due to remodeling of the Austin Music Hall, the bazaar moved its 2007 show to the Austin Convention Center and is currently at the Palmer Events Center at Auditorium Shores. The bazaar has become a nationally acclaimed arts and crafts fair with a formidable waiting list of artisan vendors. On October 12, 2020, the organizers announced the cancellation of the in-person portion of the 2020 bazaar due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot I-War is a shooter game that is primarily played in a first-person perspective, where the player takes control of an antivirus tank vehicle in order to enter into the virtual world of a worldwide computer network nicknamed \\"I-Way\\" and fight computer viruses, in addition of destroying mutated databases and collect datapods as main objectives through 21 different levels, each one increasing in scope and complexity as the player progresses through the game, with later levels introducing new enemy types and weapons that can be equipped for the player's tank.I-War game manual (Atari Jaguar, US) Before starting the game, the player has the option to choose between three different types of tanks, with each having their own advantages and disadvantages. There are three difficulty levels that the player can choose at the options menu, while other settings are available by entering a cheat code. There is also a two-player versus mode. During gameplay, the player can change the camera angles by pressing their respective number on the controller's keypad, in addition of activating a level map and other features. Unlike other games in the genre that were released for the system such as Cybermorph and Hover Strike, the levels in I-War are sorted into enclosed chambers with one-way teleportation in order to avoid repeating levels. Once the set number of mutated databases are destroyed and collecting the number of datapods within the respective level, the player has to come back to the starting point and enter into the Data Link bonus rounds, which involves grabbing datapods in an attempt to gain an extra life by either increasing or decreasing the tank's speed, while also acting as transition points to upper levels. After completing the level, the player can choose to save or not their progress, which is kept via the cartridge's internal EEPROM, while high-scores and other setting changes are automatically saved internally. If all lives are lost, the game is over.  Plot  In the future and after 20 years of being in development, the Override mainframe supercomputer, which is buried on the South Pole in order to keep its core at very low temperatures from overheating, went online on schedule and its main function is to handle information of the ever-increasingly complex internet, called I-Way, through advanced processing capabilities that the technology inside of the supercomputer offers and as such, society started depending on it and worked for years without exhibiting issues until its databases started mutating and computer viruses began to clog the I-Way, leading to delays, slow information transfers, among other issues that brings the Override to the point of self-destruction as a result of the now-mutated databases. In response to the situation, the player is assigned to pilot an antivirus tank vehicle in order to destroy mutated databases and viruses that are clogging the I-Way, in addition of collecing datapods. After traversing multiple nodes, the player finally arrives to the Override Central Block and destroys the boss database by overloading it with viruses, saving I-Way in the process until next time.  Development and release  I-War was originally advertised under the name Redemption in late 1994 and was also known internally as Dreadnaught, with plans to be originally released around the second quarter of 1995. The music was composed by Alastair Lindsay. Development of the game was completed on December 11, 1995, a few days before release. It was the last title produced by Imagitec Design for the Jaguar, as the developer started having issues with Atari during this period. The game was showcased during the Fun 'n' Games Day event hosted by Atari.  Reception  I-War received mixed to negative reception since its release. = Legacy = In 1997, two years after its release, the game's trademark was abandoned.

Digital IP-based telephone service uses control protocols such as the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), Skinny Client Control Protocol (SCCP) or various other proprietary protocols. Types VoIP phones can be simple software- based softphones or purpose-built hardware devices that appear much like an ordinary telephone or a cordless phone. Traditional PSTN phones are used as VoIP phones with analog telephone adapters (ATA). A VoIP phone or application may have many features an analog phone doesn't support, such as e-mail-like IDs for contacts that may be easier to remember than names or phone numbers, or easy sharing of contact lists among multiple accounts. Generally the features of VoIP phones follow those of Skype and other PC-based phone services, which have richer feature sets but (because they rely on mainstream operating systems' IP support) latency-related audio problems. As mainstream operating systems became better at voice applications with appropriate Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees and 5G handoff (IEEE 802.21 etc.) becomes available from wireless carriers, tablets and smartphones became the dominant interfaces. iPhone, Android and the QNX OS used in 2012-and-later BlackBerry phones are widely capable of VoIP performance. They also typically support the USB but not Ethernet or Power over Ethernet interfaces. The smartphone became the dominant VoIP phone because it works both indoors and outdoors and shifts base stations/protocols easily to trade off access costs and call clarity and other factors personal to the user, and the PoE/USB VoIP phone was thus the transitional device. Components and software A VoIP telephone consist of the hardware and software components. The software requires standard networking components such as a TCP/IP network stack, client implementation for DHCP, and the Domain Name System (DNS). In addition, a VoIP signalling protocol stack, such as for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), H.323, Skinny Client Control Protocol (Cisco), and Skype, is needed. For media streams, the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is used in most VoIP systems. For voice and media encoding, a variety of coders are available, such as for audio: G.711, GSM, iLBC, Speex, G.729, G.722, G.722.2 (AMR-WB), other audio codecs, and for video H.263, H.263+, H.264. User interface software controls the operation of the hardware components, and may respond to user actions with messages to a display screen. =STUN client= To enable the VoIP communications, the SIP/RTP packets should be utilised and STUN client would be the key component for VoIP communications with management of the SIP/RTP packets. A Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) client is used on some SIP-based VoIP phones as firewalls on network interface sometimes block SIP/RTP packets. Some special mechanism is required in this case to enable routing of SIP packets from one network to other. STUN is used in some of the sip phones to enable the SIP/RTP packets to cross boundaries of two different IP networks. A packet becomes unroutable between two sip elements if one of the networks uses private IP address range and other is in public IP address range. Stun is a mechanism to enable this border traversal. There are alternate mechanisms for traversal of NAT, STUN is just one of them. STUN or any other NAT traversal mechanism is not required when the two SIP phones connecting are routable from each other and no firewall exists in between. =DHCP client= DHCP client software simplifies connection of a device to an IP network. The software automatically configures the network and VoIP service parameters. Hardware Yealink T27G VoIP Telephone Avaya IP phone The overall hardware may look like a telephone or mobile phone. A VoIP phone has the following hardware components *Speakerphone and a microphone *Keypad or touchpad to enter phone number and text (not used for ATAs) *Display hardware to feedback user input and show caller-id/messages (not used for ATAs) *General-purpose macro processor (GPP) to process application messages *A voice engine or a digital signal processor (DSP) to process RTP messages. Some IC manufacturers provides GPP and DSP in single chip *AD and DA converters: To convert voice to digital data and vice versa *Ethernet or wireless network hardware to send and receive messages on data network *Power source - a battery or DC/AC source; some VoIP phones receive electricity from Power over Ethernet *Some VoIP phones include an RJ-11 port to connect the phone to the PSTN = Other devices = There are several Wi-Fi enabled mobile phones and PDAs that have pre-installed SIP client software, or are capable of running IP telephony clients, including most smartphones. Analog telephone adapters provide an interface for traditional analog telephones to a voice-over-IP network. They connect to the Internet or local area network using an Ethernet port and have jacks that provide a standard RJ11interface for an analog local loop. Another type of gateway device acts as a simple GSM base station and regular mobile phones can connect to this and make VoIP calls. While a license is required to run one of these in most countries these can be useful on ships or remote areas where a low-powered gateway transmitting on unused frequencies is likely to go unnoticed. Some VoIP phones also support PSTN phone lines directly. Common functionality and features *Caller ID display * Call transfer and call hold * Dialing using name/ID (differs from speed dial in that no number is stored on the client) * Locally stored and network-based directories * Conference calling and multiparty calls * Call park * Call blocking feature. * Support for multiple VoIP accounts ‚Äì the phone may register with more than one VoIP server/provider. ** Accounts are usually set and memorized on the phone itself. A more sophisticated feature is dynamic download of account settings, also known as \\"extension mobility\\". This feature allows settings stored on a server to be downloaded to the phone, based on user login. The user logs into the phone and that phone becomes the user's extension.

Prior to these restrictions being put in place, the U.S. had been the primary source of chemicals used in South American cocaine manufacture. According to the DEA, the Act sharply reduced these precursor exports and cocaine manufacturers responded by purchasing from chemical suppliers outside the U.S. The U.S. in turn successfully lobbied for inclusion of chemical controls in the 1988 United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, which included two Tables of controlled precursors. Provisions of the Act =Short Title= The subtitle is cited as the Chemical Diversion and Trafficking Act of 1988.

Located 11 km north of Serang city, the site of Old Banten contains the ruin of the walled port city of Banten, the 16th-century capital of the Sultanate of Banten. Since 1995, Old Banten has been proposed to UNESCO World Heritage. History Banten in the 16th century corresponds to the archaeological site of Old Banten. Banten was a 16th-century port city known for its pepper. The city flourished when the Islamic Banten Sultanate reached its peak during the 17th century. There was a period of intense conflicts with the Dutch East India Company (VOC) over the trade of spices, which eventually led to the dissolution of the Sultanate in Banten and to the city's decline. Today, the site where the city of Banten remains is known as Old Banten. It is a well-known tourist attraction, where many locals visit to pay their respects and pray at the graves of Sultan Maulana Hasanuddin and his descendants; or visits the Great Mosque. The area reflects the sultanate's earlier glory. Notable buildings include the impressive Great Mosque of Banten, ruins of two important Kraton (palaces), the watch tower, the water systems and the artifacts at the Museum of Banten Artifacts. Archeological sites The city of Banten was laid out in accordance with precepts imported from Java rather than mirroring local Sundanese ideas. In 1596, the city housed roughly 100,000 people. It was a walled city. Transport within the city was mainly by water: rivers, canals, and bridges. Artificial reservoir and drainage system provides clean water for the city from the southern region of the city via aqueducts and underground pipes. The area within the wall was divided into a northern and a southern half. Only Indonesians were allowed to live within the city wall; foreigners were located outside, with foreign Muslims on the northeast, foreign non- Muslims on the west, both along the shore. The northern section contained the remains of the residential compounds of the elite. There is a mosque facing a Javanese alun-alun, a typical layout of Javanese city. The compound of the shahbandar or the harbor master was located on the eastern side of the alun- alun. the Kraton of Surosowan, as well as the Great Mosque of Banten, is located in this area. Banten population was engaged in common craft such as pottery making, many of these are found and kept in a site museum. The city now has been reduced to a mere village, with squatters filling empty space in between archaeological area. Despite encouraged tourism, especially for the Great Mosque of Banten, the rest of the site received lack of proper conservation. =Kraton of Surosowan= The Surosowan Kraton is a ruined palace where the Sultans of Banten resided. The palace was built in 1552. Unlike the Kaibon Kraton, there is little left inside the kraton. The only visible remains of the kraton is the half to two meter wall ‚Äî of red stone and coral stone ‚Äî surrounding the perimeter of the kraton complex. The layout of former buildings are visible from the foundation's layout. One of the visible remains is a rectangular pool, assumed to be the pleasure pool where the princess of Banten took a bath, not different from the pleasure pool of Yogyakarta Kraton. The fort was destroyed by the Dutch during a conflict with Sultan Ageng Tirtayasa in 1680. There was a plan for reconstruction of the compounds within Kraton Surosowan in early 2013, however it is not clear how to finance the reconstruction process. =The mosques= The 16th-century Great Mosque of Banten. There are several mosques inside and outside the walled city of Old Banten. The largest mosque, and the only surviving building within the Old Banten walled city, is the Great Mosque of Banten. Well- maintained by its followers, the Great Mosque complex contains several buildings which shows a mixture of architectural style. The mosque shows a mixture of local Javanese and Chinese influence, the lighthouse-shaped minaret shows Portuguese influence, the tiyamah building (where Islamic studies are conducted), which was built by a Dutchman who converted into Islam, features a typical Dutch colonial style with its high sash window. Other remains of mosques around Old Banten are the Masjid Kanari, a tower of the ruined Masjid Pecinan Tinggi, the already demolished mosque of the Kraton Kaibon, and ruins of Koja Mosque. =Kraton of Kaibon= The Kaibon Kraton is the ruined palace and residence of Ratu Aisyah, the queen and mother of Sultan Syaifuddin. The Kraton was destroyed in 1832 following the order of Daendels, partly because unlike other Sultanates in Indonesia, the Sultanate of Banten never bowed to the colonial government. Several buildings are still visible. =Avalokiteshvara Vihara= The Chinese temple is one of the oldest in Indonesia. The existence of this vihara in Old Banten means that the Buddhist religion was tolerated in the overall Muslim city of Banten. =Fort Speelwijk= European cemetery near Fort Speelwijk Not far from the Great Mosque of Banten is a Dutch fort built in 1682. The fort is square shaped. There is a European cemetery to the southeast of the fort. =Museum of Old Banten= The Museum of Old Banten (Indonesian \\"Museum Situs Kepurbakalaan Banten Lama\\") is a museum located between Surosowan Kraton and the Great Mosque. The museum kept archaeological remnants such as ceramic vases, roof, and coins related with the historic port city of Banten. Other important artifacts are Meriam Ki Amuk (a 2.5 meter long Ottoman cannon) and a stone pepper mill. =Vicinity of Old Banten= Remains of a water treatment station south of Old Banten. Three of these water reservoirs can still be seen today. There are remnants of infrastructures outside the walled city of Banten. Tasik Ardi (Ardi Lake) is a rectangular 5 hectare artificial lake formerly used as a water reservoir for the city of Banten. From this reservoir, water are channeled via pipes and viaducts to the city, passing a series of water treatment stations. Some of these water treatment stations are still visible today. The village of Kasunyatan, several meter south of Old Banten, was once an Islamic learning center for the Sultan of Banten. There are several tombs and 16th-century Kasunyatan Mosque in the village.

It is usually hit from the back of the tennis court, around the baseline. A tennis player whose strategy is to trade groundstrokes with the opponent is termed a baseliner, as opposed to volleyers who prefers to hit volleys near the net. There are many factors that may define a good groundstroke. For example, one groundstroke may use topspin and another backspin. Both can be effective for different reasons having to do with depth, opponent's strength or weaknesses, etc. Some characteristics of groundstrokes are: depth (how close the ball lands to the opponent's baseline), consistency (the tendency of groundstrokes to not drop short or into an opponent‚Äôs strike range in rallies with many groundstrokes), speed (how fast it travels in the air), pace (the ball's behavior after it bounces on the opponent's side), trajectory and angle. If a \\"good groundstroke\\" is to be played, it would generally have a combination of the above characteristics to produce a shot that is difficult for the opponent to return. Generally, a groundstroke that lands deep and in the corner of the opponent's court will make it more difficult for the opponent to return the ball. However, this is somewhat arbitrary and depends on the opponent and stage of the point being played. For example, a short angled shot, a moon ball (very high trajectory), an off pace shot, etc., may prove effective against opponent A but not opponent B.

She was part of the Russian New Wave literary movement. She was cited by Joseph Brodsky as the best living poet in the Russian language.Bella Akhmadulina CriticismSonia Ketchian: The Poetic Craft of Bella Akhmadulina She is known in Russia as \\"the voice of the epoch\\". Despite the aforementioned apolitical stance of her writing, Akhmadulina was often critical of authorities in the Soviet Union, and spoke out in favour of others, including Nobel laureates Boris Pasternak, Andrei Sakharov, and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. She was known to international audiences via her travels abroad during the Khrushchev Thaw, during which she made appearances in sold-out stadiums. Upon her death in 2010 at the age of 73, President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev hailed her poetry as a \\"classic of Russian literature.\\" The New York Times said Akhmadulina was \\"always recognized as one of the Soviet Union's literary treasures and a classic poet in the long line extending from Lermontov and Pushkin.\\" Sonia I. Ketchian, writing in The Poetic Craft of Bella Akhmadulina, called her \\"one of the great poets of the 20th century. There's Akhmatova, Tsvetaeva, Mandelstam, and Pasternak ‚Äì and she's the fifth\\". Early life, education and works Bella Akhmadulina was born in Moscow on 10 April 1937, the only child of a Tatar father and a Russian-Italian mother. They underwent evacuation to Kazan when World War II broke out. Akhmadulina's literary career began when she was a school-girl working as a journalist at the Moscow newspaper, Metrostroevets, and improving her poetic skills at a circle organized by the poet Yevgeny Vinokurov. Her first poems appeared in the magazine October after being approved by established Soviet poets. These first poems were published in 1955. √âmigr√© critic Marc Slonim described her prospects as follows in 1964 (Soviet Russian Literature): \\"Her voice has such a purity of tone, such richness of timbre, such individuality of diction, that if her growth continues she will be able some day to succeed Akhmatova\\" as \\"the greatest living woman poet in Russia\\". After finishing school, Akhmadulina entered the Maxim Gorky Literature Institute from which she graduated in 1960. While studying at the institute, she published her poems and articles in different newspapers, both official and handwritten. She was the subject of criticism in Komsomolskaya Pravda in 1957. She was expelled in 1959 (but allowed re-entry as time progressed) as a result of her opposition to the persecution of Boris Pasternak. In 1962 the first collection of her poems, titled Struna (The String), was published and was a resounding success. In spite of being expunged, many of her collections of verses were published later: Music lessons (1970), Poems (1975), Candle (1977), Dreams of Georgia (1977), The Mystery (1983), Coastline (1991), and others. A collection called Sad (Garden) led to Akhmadulina receiving the USSR State Prize in 1989. \\"Many dogs and one dog\\", a short story written in a surreal style, was published in 1979 in Samizdat's Metropol Almanac. She assisted in the creation of Metropol. She wrote essays about Alexander Pushkin and Mikhail Lermontov. She appeared in sold-out stadiums in the 1960s, as did the poets Yevgeny Yevtushenko, Andrei Voznesensky and Robert Rozhdestvensky. Her open letter was published supporting the exiled Andrei Sakharov. In October 1993, she signed the Letter of Forty-Two. She was a journalist in a 1964 film. Bella participated in many international poetry events including Kuala Lumpur International Poetry Reading (1988).Imbauan PPDKL (Pengucapan Puisi Dunia Kuala Lumpur) (1986‚Äì2002). Kuala Lumpur: DBP, 2004, p. 97-98 After the Soviet Union she published Casket and Key (1994), A Guiding Sound (1995) and One Day in December (1996). =Translations= The main themes of Akhmadulina's works are friendship, love, and relations between people. She wrote numerous essays about Russian poets and translators, some devoted to her close friend, Bulat Okudzhava. Akhmadulina avoided writing overtly political poems, but took part in political events in her youth, supporting the so- called \\"dissident movement\\". She translated into Russian poetry from France, Italy, Chechnya, Poland, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Georgia, Armenia, and many others. Akhmadulina wrote in a \\"resolutely apolitical\\" style. She made use of imagery and humour in her work. She used rhymed quatrains in her early works, which discussed ordinary, yet imaginative occurrences from daily life in language that was full of both archaisms and neologisms. Religion and philosophy became her themes as she aged and she wrote in longer forms. Personal life Bella Akhmadulina and Anna Netrebko at the Russian State Prize ceremony at the Kremlin Bella's first marriage in 1954 was to Yevgeny Yevtushenko, another famous poet of the era; her second husband, whom she married in 1960, was Yuri Nagibin, a major novelist and screenwriter. Her third marriage in 1971 to film director Eldar Kuliev produced a daughter, Elizaveta Kulieva, who is also a poet. In 1974, she married her last husband, the famous artist and stage designer Boris Messerer. They had homes in Peredelkino and Moscow. Death Akhmadulina died at her home in Peredelkino near Moscow on 29 November 2010 at the age of 73. Akhmadulina's husband said her death was from a heart condition, describing it as a \\"cardiovascular crisis\\". Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin both paid tribute, with Medvedev writing on his blog that the death was an \\"irreparable loss\\". Medevdev also wrote that Akhmadulina's poetry was a \\"classic of Russian literature\\".

He was a member of the Communist Workers' Party of Germany and acted as their delegate to the Third Congress of the Third International. He was born in Berlin in 1888, the son of Bruno Reichenbach. His younger brother, Hans Reichenbach would go on to become a leading philosopher of science. He became an actor in Bochum and Hamburg the period 1912-1914. He made his first trip to Russia in this capacity. Bernhard was a conscientious objector but felt it was his duty to serve his country. He therefore volunteered for the medical corps and served in the German army during the First World War between 1915‚Äì1917. His time in the medical corps saw him serve at the Battle of Verdun. Bernhard was awarded the Iron Cross during his years of service, ultimately throwing his medal into the River Spree following the rise of the Nazis. Bernhard joined the German Foreign Office following discharge from the medical corps, where he served until 1919. Bernhard joined the Communist Workers' Party of Germany and, in 1921 shortly after the birth of his son, Hanno, travelled to the Soviet Union as one of the party's representatives. At the Third Congress of the Third International, Bernhard held discussions with Vladimir Lenin. He also made contacts in the Moscow theatre, meeting Solomon Mikhoels and Alexis Granowsky. He worked with Granowsky on a production of Mayakovsky's Mystery-Bouffe. This was being produced by Meyerhold. Reichenbach was a trained economist and subsequently worked as a purchasing agent for a chemical company. With the coming to power of Adolf Hitler and his Nazi party, Reichenbach -- as a German of Jewish descent, and with communist political beliefs, came under threat and fled to Great Britain via the Netherlands. During the Second World War, he worked for the British Foreign office, on various anti-Nazi publications which were distributed around Germany; he would later be awarded the Verdienstkreuz 1, Klasse, the German equivalent of an O.B.E., for this work. Reichenbach married Ilze Rosendorn, with whom he had two children, Hanno and Tania. Hanno attended Great Ayton Friends' School, with several other German or Austrian refugees.

The station is owned by the Milwaukee Radio Group subsidiary of Saga Communications. Its studios (which are shared with the other four sister stations) and transmitter are located in Milwaukee's West Side. History =Early years (1995‚Äì2007)= The 106.9 frequency came into being in Milwaukee when it was licensed as WLJU on February 10, 1993. The new station was owned by Harris Classical Broadcasting, which also owned Milwaukee's heritage Classical station, WFMR. It formally signed on for the first time in August 1995 as WFMI, playing a satellite-fed smooth jazz format. A more powerful and resourceful station, WJZI (93.3) converted from a failing rock format as WQFM to smooth jazz in 1996, giving WFMI stiff competition. Both WFMR and WFMI were sold to Saga Communications, and WFMI was quickly switched to a Modern AC format, becoming WXPT on May 9, 1997, branded as \\"106.9 The Point\\" (the first song on \\"The Point\\" was Sheryl Crow's \\"A Change Would Do You Good\\").http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1997/RR-1997-05-16.pdf When Chicago's WPNT-FM changed formats a few months later, 106.9 picked up the WPNT call sign. They had modest success for a small station, but a few of the bigger stations in the market took notice and adjusted their playlists to fight off the young suburban upstart. The station is also hamstrung by a traditionally weak signal which has never covered the important suburban markets like the Waukesha and Ozaukee County suburbs very well, and is virtually non-existent north of the Sheboygan County line, where it runs into adjacent-channel interference from WHBZ on 106.5. This is because the frequency was a short-spacing allocation which is shared with WOOD-FM across Lake Michigan in Muskegon, Michigan, which is at a very strong 50,000 watts compared to this station's weaker power, and it does have conflicting interference with that station on the northern rim of their coverage area. Again, due to stiff competition, the format was changed again at 3 p.m. on April 16, 1999, this time to a trendy new format known as Jammin' Oldies, and the call letters became WMJO (Milwaukee's Jammin' Oldies).http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1999/RR-1999-04-23.pdf The calls were changed a month later to WJMR and tag line to \\"Jammin' Hits\\" due to legal issues. Saga Communications moved WFMR to the 106.9 FM dial position, and WJMR-FM's format and call letters to 98.3, on December 12, 2000. This was done primarily to boost WJMR- FM's signal in the urban areas of Milwaukee, and to target WFMR toward the western and northern suburbs. Saga moved the studios to Milwaukee the year before, in 1999. =Smooth Jazz 106.9 (2007‚Äì2010)= At midnight on June 26, 2007, ironically on the 51st anniversary of its original sign-on, WFMR ended its classical music format when it flipped to the Smooth Jazz format, a change made quickly to gain momentum from rival WJZI, which dropped the format a week earlier to become light Adult Contemporary music as WLDB/B93.3. On July 15, 2007, the station changed its call sign to WJZX.Call Sign History On April 24, 2007, the FCC granted what was then WFMR a construction permit to move its transmitter from its original site in Menomonee Falls to the WJYI/WHQG/WJMR tower in Milwaukee outside of the stations' main studios on McKinley Avenue. However, because the station moved closer to Lake Michigan, the power was thus reduced in half from the Menomonee Falls signal to 4.4 kW in order to protect what was then WMUS (currently WOOD-FM) across the lake. 106.9's HD Radio signal was put into service in 2008, though because of the current limitations of digital radio the digital signal only covers the city of Milwaukee and eastern Waukesha County proper. =Aborted \\"Now\\" format (May‚ÄìJune 2010)= On May 27, 2010 at Noon, after playing \\"Life in the Fast Lane\\" by Dave Koz, WJZX flipped from Broadcast Architecture's syndicated satellite feed Smooth AC \\"Smooth Jazz Network\\" to a stunt format called \\"Tiger 106.9\\", which referenced Tiger Woods's scandals and featured cheating-themed music from all eras. Saga had reserved the call letters WNQW, possibly referring to the then-popular \\"Now\\" format of Top 40 music and announced them publicly in the media, which may have proved to be problematic in hindsight as seen below. The format change was likely done due to the introduction of Arbitron's Portable People Meter audience measurement system in the month of June into the Milwaukee market. BA's smooth/urban AC format remained for a period of time without local broadcasters on 106.9's HD Radio HD2 subchannel, which has since been replaced with an HD relay of sister AM station WJYI, which has a Christian/brokered programming format. Internet listeners were referred to the live stream of Saga sister station WJZA in Columbus, Ohio, which featured the same basic format and playlist structuring as the former WJZI. However, WJZA has since also changed format to classic hits. The next day, at 9 a.m., the 70s/80s rock station WQBW, owned by Clear Channel Communications, flipped to top 40 as \\"97.3 Radio Now.\\" This was likely done to block Saga's attempt to brand 106.9 with the new WNQW calls as \\"106.9 Now\\".\\"Smooth Jazz, Brew and Radio Now Recap\\" from Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel (May 28, 2010) 106.9's new call sign was registered with the FCC on May 21. Clear Channel appeared ready to reformat \\"The Brew\\" even before WJZX's stunting, and put it into place earlier than expected to claim the \\"Now\\" brand before 106.9 had the opportunity. 97.3 took the calls WRNW on June 10. The \\"Tiger Radio\\" stunt carried over into May 29 before a switch to songs featuring the word \\"America\\" in the title throughout the remainder of the Memorial Day holiday weekend. Saga also could not cancel the WNQW calls, which were implemented as scheduled on May 28, so it retained those calls until it filed for a new set. The station switched to another stunt format on June 2, playing The Beatles' entire catalog in alphabetical order. The catalog looped several times through the next few days. =Big Buck Country 106.9 (2010‚Äì2012)= On June 7, 2010, at 3 p.m., after the Beatles stunt ended with \\"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\\", 106.9 finally debuted their new permanent format, with the name \\"Big Buck Country 106.9.\\" The station played classic country, which focused on country music from the late 1970s through early 1990s and debuted with the Alan Jackson hit \\"Gone Country\\". It put 106.9 in direct competition with AM Clear Channel operation WOKY (920), Clear Channel station WMIL-FM (106.1), and West Bend's WBWI-FM (92.5), which has most of its audience in Milwaukee's northern suburbs. The call letters WZBK-FM became effective June 15, 2010, calls already in use by a sister AM operation in Keene, New Hampshire. =Energy 106.9 (2012‚Äìpresent)= On September 7, 2012, at 10 a.m., after playing \\"What Might Have Been\\" by Little Texas and the first minute and a half of \\"The Thunder Rolls\\" by Garth Brooks (which began repeating on the line \\"When the thunder rolls/and the lightning strikes...\\" before grinding to a halt that led into energizing sound effects featuring thunder and lightning), WZBK changed their format to Rhythmic Top 40, branded as \\"Energy 106.9\\". \\"Energy\\" launched with \\"Party Rock Anthem\\" by LMFAO.\\"Big Buck Gets Energy\\" from Format Change (September 7, 2012)Saga Gives Milwaukee an \\"Energy\\" Boost- RadioInsight from Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (September 7, 2012) In a statement from general manager Annmarie Topel, the station's format will be similar to a contemporary-hits format, but with \\"no bubble-gum pop,\\" and added that \\"As the (rhythmic CHR) format evolves, there are great opportunities for stations that are newer, faster, cleaner and leaner.\\" On September 12, the call letters were changed to WNRG-FM. (Despite this, WNRG-FM continued using the WZBK legal ID liners for two more days.) In its first 30 days, WNRG was commercial free and promised to play 10,069 songs until October 8, when it added commercials and began promising to play 60 minutes of music per hour on air. The flip to Rhythmic also brings the format back to Milwaukee for the first time since September 1994, when WLUM carried the format before they flipped to Alternative, which at the time was due to owner Willie Davis' decision to move the station away from playing the increasing Hip-Hop content that he felt was too offensive. Like WLUM (during its later years), WNRG-FM's Rhythmic playlist is heavily focused on Rhythmic Pop/Dance currents, but has incorporated more R&B;/Hip-Hop into the musical mix.\\"New 'rhythmic' format for 106.9 radio\\" from Milwaukee Business Journal (September 7, 2012) As such, WNRG-FM faces competition from Top 40/CHR rival WXSS, and from Urban Contemporary rival WKKV.\\"Saga Gives Milwaukee An Energy Boost\\" from Radio Insight (September 7, 2012) WNRG-FM is also the first station in the Saga Communications Rhythmic Top 40 line up to be launched on a full-powered signal, as their two other outlets in Des Moines (HITS99.9 K260AM/KIOA) and Champaign (HITS99.7 WIXY-HD3 & W259BG), broadcasts on simulcasting HD radio subchannels and FM translators. They also share the same fonts and logos except for the branding (Des Moines and Champaign's monikers are \\"Hits\\").

The company specializes in software and services for communications, media and financial services providers and digital enterprises.  History  The company was founded in 1982 in Israel as an offshoot of Golden Pages, the Israeli phone directory company, which was owned by the Aurec Group headed by Morris Kahn. In 1982, Boaz Dotan became Amdocs' first President and CEO. Together with others at Golden Pages, Kahn developed a billing software program for phone directory companies and with Boaz Dotan established a company called Aurec Information & Directory Systems to market this product. In 1985, Southwestern Bell Corporation acquired a 50 percent ownership share of Aurec Information & Directory Systems, and its name was changed to Amdocs. Within two years, the Aurec Group sold off all its holdings in Amdocs for almost US$1 billion. Between 1990 and 1995 Amdocs took its initial diversification steps, expanding first into the wireline telephony arena and then the mobile space. Over the years, Amdocs has continued to expand its product and services offerings. In 1995, Avi Naor replaced Boaz Dotan as President and CEO of Amdocs. The company went public on the New York Stock Exchange in June 1998, moving to the NASDAQ Global Select Market in 2014. Amdocs entered the managed services space in 1999 with the acquisition of ITDS. Amdocs acquired software firm Clarify in 2001 for $200 million. In 2002, Dov Baharav replaced Avi Naor as Amdocs' President and CEO. In 2005, Amdocs acquired billing and CRM provider DST Innovis for $238 million. In 2006, Amdocs acquired Cramer Systems. Amdocs acquired Israeli startup SigValue in 2007 for $85 million. In 2008, Amdocs acquired Irish software company Changing Worlds for $60 million. In November 2010, Eli Gelman replaced Dov Baharav as Amdocs' President and CEO. Also in 2010, Amdocs acquired MX Telecom for $104 million. In 2011, Amdocs acquired Bridgewater Systems. The company acquired Celcite in 2013 for $129 million. Also in 2013, Amdocs acquired Actix. In 2015, Amdocs acquired a majority of Comverse BSS for $272 million. In 2016, Amdocs acquired Vindicia. Also in 2016, Amdocs acquired Tel Aviv- based company Pontis. In September 2016, Amdocs acquired Irish software company Brite:Bill. In late 2017, Amdocs acquired Kenzan Media. In 2018, Amdocs acquired projekt202. In 2018, Amdocs acquired Vubiquity for $224 million. Following the acquisition, former Vubiquity CEO Darcy Antonellis became head of Amdocs Media Division. Also in 2018, Amdocs acquired Canadian company UXP Systems. In October 2018, Shuky Sheffer replaced Eli Gelman as Amdocs' President and CEO. In January 2020, Amdocs donated resources including food packs to Globe Telecom as part of aid operations for Filipino communities affected by the eruption of Taal volcano. These donations came as part of Amdocs Corporate Social Responsibility program. In July 2020, Amdocs acquired Openet telecom Inc., a world-leading provider of 5G charging, policy and cloud technologies.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amdocs-acquire-openet-accelerate- pace-200500579.html On 5 August 2020, Amdocs reported that Orange Liberia has collaborated with Amdocs to update its end-to - end digital enabling infrastructure to minimize time-to - market and make it easier for its consumers to deliver more creative, personalized products and packages including smartphone, internet and Orange Money services.  Controversy  Amdocs' broad access to U.S. telephone transaction records has raised counterintelligence concerns in the U.S. government about the vulnerability of this information to exploitation by Israeli spies. \\"As early as 1999, the National Security Agency issued a warning that records of U.S. government telephone calls were ending up in foreign hands ‚Äì Israel's, in particular.\\" In early 2000, federal agencies conducted a counterintelligence investigation to determine if Amdocs was being used by Israel to eavesdrop on U.S. government communications. The investigation found no evidence of such activity. See also * Matrix (protocol) * VOIP telephony * Israeli spyware * Amdocs (Israel) Ltd. v. Openet Telecom, Inc.

It is also known as black cod, though they have no relation to cod, family Gadidae, and sable fish or sablefish, which is a name commonly used for other species in the family Anoplopomatidae. Found on deep rocky bottoms in the North Pacific at depths of up to 440 metres, they can reach up to 1.83 metres in length and weigh up to 91 kilograms. Young fish display striking white blotches on their body, however their colour changes to dark grey with maturity, and the bright markings become duller and less visible as they grow, similar to the Tiger shark's stripes.  Description  Skilfish are large and bulky fish, which bear a resemblance to the wreckfish in the family Polyprionid, and the groupers or sea bass in the family Serranidae, although skilfish are not related to any of those families. They are very long-lived fish, with some caught specimens being over 90 years old. Skilfish have a dark colored body, with almost black fins, and large, blue eyes above a projactile, cavernous grouper-like mouth. They also have strong caudal fins, which are as tall or taller than the fish's head. Skilfish can grow to a length of 1.83 m, and a weight of 91kg.  Biology  Skilfish are the predators of a large number of bony fishes, such as eels, capelin, Pacific cod, pollock, candlefish, herring, mackarel, mullets, cephalopods like squid, octopus, crustaceans such as shrimp, small crabs, and they may also consume jellyfishes and eel leptocephalus. Rockfish may be also prey, as one dissected specimen had a stomach full of rockfish spines.

SEUCK) is a game creation system for the Commodore 64, Amiga and Atari ST created by Sensible Software and published by Outlaw (part of Palace Software) in 1987. It allows the user to make simple shoot 'em ups by drawing sprites and backgrounds and editing attack patterns. The advertising promoted the Kit with the phrase \\"By the programmers of Wizball and Parallax\\".  Design  Editing a sprite in Shoot'Em-Up Construction Kit The Kit presents users with a series of menus for customising every aspect of the game. Level graphics are created with the Background Editor, using a series of blocks for plotting into the level maps' all moving elements are designed with the Sprite Editor. Sprites are assigned to \\"Objects\\" - for example, enemy bullets - with separate animation and colour settings. Editing the \\"enemy bits\\" changes the behaviour of an enemy (which projectiles it may shoot, how many points it is worth), while \\"player limitations\\" does the same for Player 1 (or player 2, if enabled). Whereas the Commodore 64 version contains a simple Sound FX Editor with slider controls, on the Amiga and ST versions this feature is replaced with IFF sounds. Enemies are added to the game by placing them on the background and then moving them, with options to link enemies together. The front end (title screen) may also be edited. Games can feature still screens (held for a set number of seconds), \\"push\\" scrolling (based on the player's movement) or constant vertical scrolling. Bonus point items are possible, as well as extra lives awarded at regular scoring intervals. SEUCK is packaged with sample games, to demonstrate what may be done with the kit. The Commodore 64 version comes with Slap 'n' Tickle (inspired by Slap Fight), Outlaw (a Wild West shoot 'em up in the style of the arcade game Commando), Transputer Man (set inside a computer and partially inspired by the arcade game Robotron 2084), and Celebrity Squares (featuring graphics drawn by several C64 personalities including video game journalists Gary Liddon and Gary Penn).http://www.seuck.retrogaming64.com/guide2.html The Amiga and Atari versions (released in 1989) feature Slap 'n' Tickle, Quazar, and an \\"army man\\" game, Blood 'N' Bullets, which features a sound effect of \\"Okay, suckers\\" sampled from the Red Dwarf episode \\"Queeg\\". Since it is possible to export SEUCK games as stand-alone files, at the height of the software's popularity game companies and magazines received many games created with the Kit. http://www.seuck.retrogaming64.com/megastar.html  Reception  SEUCK was well received, earning a Zzap! Gold Medal Award. SEUCK was reviewed in Commodore Disk User Issue 2.  Derivatives  Example of a SEUCK-derived game While attending college Ray Larabie, best known for his custom typefaces, created several games using SEUCK. Because of their distinctiveness and quality they quickly spread throughout the Amiga community via the BBS network, with many ending up on Amiga Magazine coverdisks. Titles included Monster Truck Rally, Wielder Of Atoms, Mulroney Blast and Smurf Hunt. Other notable SEUCK-based titles include several works by Italian software company, System Editoriale s.r.l., such as Emiliano Sciarra's Ciuffy, and the early * Garry Kitchen's GameMaker - A versatile game development platform for the C64. * Arcade Game Construction Kit - Another game development platform for the C64. * Adventure Construction Set * Pinball Construction Set  References   External links  * The SEUCK Vault, a website with tips on using the Kit. * S.E.U.C.K., a free remake of SEUCK for Windows, Linux and Mac, implemented using GLBasic. * German C64-Wiki, in-depth German Wiki-site for the construction kit. * Shoot 'Em Up Kit, a shoot 'em up creator inspired by the SEUCK.

He won a 1943 Pulitzer Prize as a Daily News war correspondent. Weller's reports from Nagasaki after its August 1945 nuclear bombing were censored by the U.S. military and not published in full until a book edited by his son in 2006. Life and career Weller was born in Boston in 1907 and graduated from the Roxbury Latin School in 1925. He was editorial chairman of The Harvard Crimson as a college student graduated from Harvard in 1929. During his senior year there, he wrote the book and co-wrote the lyrics for the 83rd annual Hasty Pudding Club musical comedy production, Fireman, Save My Child! He studied acting in Vienna, Austria as the only American member of Max Reinhardt's theater company. Weller was named to the Balkan reporting team of The New York Times, and during the 1930s also published two novels, numerous short stories, and freelance journalism from around Europe.Betty Wason, Miracle in Hellas: The Greeks Fight On. \\"Departure from Athens\\", 1943, pp.109‚Äì111. Weller was married twice, first in 1932 to artist Katherine Deupree (1906‚Äì1984) of Cincinnati, with whom he had a daughter Ann. They divorced in 1944, and in 1948 he married reporter Charlotte Ebener (1918‚Äì1990): their marriage ended with Charlotte's death. In 1957, Weller had a second child, Anthony,Nichols, Darren v Weller, Anthony [1997 NSWRT 212], Residential Tribunal of NSW. by the British ballet teacher and scholar Gladys Lasky Weller (1922‚Äì1988), with whom he maintained a relationship for over thirty years.A 2006 court case suggests that while Gladys Lasky did not marry Weller, she adopted the name of Weller pursuant to a Deed Poll from the British government. = World War II = In December 1940, soon after the beginning of World War II, Weller began working for the Chicago Daily News Foreign Service and covered the war in Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Pacific as one of the war's great correspondents, winning a 1943 Pulitzer Prize for his work. He wrote a pamphlet \\"The Belgian Campaign in Ethiopia\\" published by the Belgian Information Center as part of its World War II dissemination of information favorable to Belgium and to Belgium's role in the Belgian Congo, a valuable colony then and for many previous decades. This pamphlet is based on 1941 interviews with Belgian officers who led an army consisting of troops who had been local black police in the Belgian Congo, then Belgium's African colony and originally the personal property of King Leopold of Belgium's royal family. The interviews described and celebrated the surrender of Italian General Gazzera, and were conducted following the conclusion of the Belgian campaign, a \\"trek of 2,500 miles through jungle swamps and desert wastes.\\" Hardships, heroism and aggressive action against a numerically superior Italian force are reflected as well as the role of the Belgian Congo Army's victory in assisting WWII Allied efforts to oppose the Axis in the colonial sphere. Based on articles first published in the Chicago Daily News, this pamphlet joined such publications as King Leopold Vindicated in the repertoire of the Belgium Information Center. Office of Strategic Services (OSS, predecessor to the Central Intelligence Agency) officers were involved with United States government and military personnel in securing the supply from the Shinkolobwe mine of most of the uranium critical to production of the atomic bombs dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima that brought World War II to an end.Laxalt, Robert (1998) A Private War: An American Code Officer in the Belgian Congo Anthony Mockler in his definitive work Haile Selassie's War: The Italian-Ethiopian Campaign, 1935‚Äì1941 states that \\"troops from the Belgian Congo had reached their 'theatre of operations'‚Äîthe Baro Salient‚Äîin February 1941\\". George Weller reported from Singapore in January 1942. At 8:15 a.m. January 31 the British blew a 70-foot gap in the causeway to Johor. On February 15, 1942, British forces in Singapore surrendered to the Japanese. Giles Playfair, then of the Malaya Broadcasting Corporation, in an entry dated January 29 writes: \\"Outside the bank I met George Weller who told me that he was off to Java this afternoon and bade me a fond farewell.\\"Singapore Goes Off The Air 1943 Playfair p.136 Weller's reports from Singapore would be published the next year in the book Singapore is Silent. Weller's War includes articles which were published (wholly or in part) by Chicago Daily News, Boston Globe(August 31 and September 1, 1945) and London Daily Telegraph(September 1, 1945). Weller's reporting on Nagasaki remains one of his lasting legacies. = After the war = In 1946, Weller covered the 1946 Greek war against partisan guerrillas. For many years he covered the Balkans, Mideast and Africa from Rome, where he headed the Daily News bureau until retiring from the newspaper in 1975. From their base in Rome, Weller's wife Charlotte, herself a newspaper writer, often accompanied him on assignments, including Indonesia and Saudi Arabia.Charlotte Ebener Weller Papers, Library of Congress; book No Facilities for Women 1955 Weller died at his home in San Felice Circeo, Italy, on December 19, 2002 at the age of 95.Anthony Weller vs. Ann Weller Tagge & Fleet Bank. =Professional honors= In 1942 Weller interviewed crew members who witnessed an emergency appendectomy performed on by Wheeler Bryson Lipes and other non-doctors, partly with a tea strainer and spoons.

Retrieved 2013-11-11. General Douglas MacArthur honored him by conferring a special distinction: \\"It is a real pleasure to me to award you the Asiatic-Pacific Service Ribbon in view of your long and meritorious services in the Southwest Pacific Area with the forces of this command. You have added luster to the difficult, dangerous and arduous profession of War Correspondent.\\"[source: letter 15 March 1945] Weller was also awarded a 1954 George Polk Memorial Award for Foreign Reporting and a Nieman Fellowship at Harvard. Late in life he received Italy's Premio Internazionale di Giornalismo. He also provided the inspiration for longtime friend Se√°n √ì Faol√°in's 1974 short story Something, Everything, Anything, Nothing. Legacy The Notes in the book The Last Train from Hiroshima state: \\"As it was, Weller's notes were confiscated and classified. Later, his carbon copies were stored and replicated (in edited form) as internal military and Atomic Energy Commission documents‚Äîand in time, they became more or less gospel.\\" In an article published in the Chicago Daily News, Saturday August 14, 1965, Weller stated, \\"The original notes and the original stories are buried in a family attic in New England.\\" In the foreword to his Weller's final book, First Into Nagasaki, published posthumously in 2006, Walter Cronkite wrote: > This is an important book‚Äîimportant and gripping.

Artist unknown Ludwig Senfl (born around 1486, died between December 2, 1542 and August 10, 1543) was a Swiss composer of the Renaissance, active in Germany. He was the most famous pupil of Heinrich Isaac, was music director to the court of Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, and was an influential figure in the development of the Franco- Flemish polyphonic style in Germany.  Life  Senfl was probably born in Basel around 1486, and lived in Z√ºrich from 1488 until 1496, when he joined the choir of the Hofkapelle of Emperor Maximilian I in Augsburg. Apart from one brief visit in 1504 he appears never again to have lived in Switzerland. In 1497 he followed the Hofkapelle to Vienna, and between 1500 and 1504 he probably studied in Vienna for three years, the standard practice for choirboys whose voices had broken, as part of the normal training for the priesthood. During this period he studied with Heinrich Isaac, serving as his copyist by 1509; he is known to have copied much of the older composer's Choralis Constantinus, an enormous work which he was later to complete after Isaac's death. After a trip to Italy sometime between 1508 and 1510, Senfl returned to the Hofkapelle; the Emperor appointed him to fill Isaac's position as court composer when Isaac died in 1517. In 1518 Senfl lost a toe in a hunting accident; evidently the injury disabled him for up to a year. When the Emperor died in 1519, Senfl was out of a job, and his circumstances altered for the worse: Charles V dismissed most of Maximilian's musicians, and even refused to pay Senfl the annual stipend which had been promised to him in the event of the emperor's death. During the next few years he traveled widely, mainly job-seeking, but he was also active as a composer. He is known to have attended the Diet of Worms in 1521, and, while he never officially became a Protestant, his sympathies evidently were with Luther, and he was later examined by the Inquisition and voluntarily gave up his priesthood. Senfl carried on an extensive correspondence both with Lutheran Duke Albrecht of Prussia and with Martin Luther himself, beginning in 1530. Eventually Senfl acquired a post in Munich, a place which had high musical standards, a strong need for new music, and which was relatively tolerant of those with Protestant sympathies; he was to remain there for the rest of his life. By 1540 he was ill, judging from his correspondence with Duke Albrecht, and he probably died in early 1543.  Music and influence  Senfl was an eclectic composer, at home both in the worlds of sacred and secular music, and he modeled his style carefully on models provided by the Franco-Flemish composers of the previous generation, especially Josquin des Prez. In particular, he was a gifted melodist, and his lines are warmly lyrical; his music remained popular and influential in Germany through the 17th century. His sacred music includes masses, motets, vespers settings, and a Magnificat. Technically his music has many archaic features, such as the use of cantus firmus technique, which was more in vogue in the 15th century; he even occasionally employs isorhythm. However he also has a typically Germanic liking for singable melodic passages in parallel imperfect intervals (3rds and 6ths). Senfl also wrote numerous German lieder, most of them secular (the handful on sacred texts were written for Duke Albrecht of Prussia). They vary widely in character, from extremely simple settings of a cantus firmus to contrapuntal tours-de-force such as elaborate canons and quodlibets.

The school was built in 2003 and was named after Todd Morgan Beamer, a passenger aboard United Airlines Flight 93 during the September 11, 2001 attacks. He was one of the passengers who attempted to foil the hijacking and reclaim the aircraft, which crashed into a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania. The school was opened in September 2003. Todd Beamer Campus received a $675,000 grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for staff development during the school's first three years. Academics The school has three separate academies as of 2012, each named for one of the school colors and with its own choice of teachers and electives. The three academies are the Blue Academy (previously Puget Sound Business and Industry Academy); Green Academy (previously the Math, Science, Health and Fitness Academy); and Silver Academy (previously the School of Global Leadership & Economics). A fourth academy, the Northwest College Preparatory Academy, was created in 2005, but was merged with the other three academies in 2009 due to budget and teacher cuts. Athletics Todd Beamer's sports teams are called the Titans and compete in the Olympic Division of the North Puget Sound League.http://www.federalwaymirror.com/sports/367006581.html Todd Beamer's men's soccer team won the 4A State Championship in 2017, with an astounding 19‚Äì1‚Äì1 record, beating Pasco 2‚Äì1, in the 4A State Championship. The soccer 4A title was the School's first State title in any sport, in their history since its opening in September 2003.https://www.thenewstribune.com/sports/high-school/article153117779.html Federal Way Department of Public Safety Incidents =Gun Scare= TBHS made national news as a student brought three guns to school on April 19, 2007, just three days after The Virginia Tech Massacre. The school was put into a lockdown for an hour. Another lockdown occurred in 2013 when two seniors allegedly threatened a bus driver with fake guns during the 2012 - 2013 school year. The school remained in a lockdown for one hour. = PETA = After a Todd Beamer High School student followed up a campaign promise by swallowing a live goldfish, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) criticised the school. PETA felt that \\"people who harm small animals, often go on to harm larger animals or even people.\\" The incident made statewide news, and eventually onto national news. Radio talk shows hosts such as Howard Stern suggested that the incident was blown out of proportion. =Bathroom fires= In December 2008, TBHS was subjected to 3 consecutive days of repeated arson in several of the school's bathrooms. It began on Monday, December 8, where a purposeful fire was created in a bathroom's trash can. This also occurred the next day, December 9; and the day after, December 10. All students were safely evacuated each day and none were injured. Principal Liz Drake made announcements throughout the week over the intercom to keep students calm. The school received some minor repairable damages from the incident. The students responsible for the fires were caught and dealt with by the police. This event led to the installation of security cameras in Beamer's hallways. Facilities The building was designed as an assemblage of structures around a central courtyard, similar to a village, to reinforce more personalized smaller groupings and recall the historic rural settlement patterns of the area. Learning spaces were designed to be highly flexible and convertible to accommodate changing methodologies and technology. The project was designed by Bassetti Architects to accommodate an easy conversion of the school into departmental-, academy-, grade-, or project-based learning models. The innovative design was recognized as a finalist for the James D. MacConnell Award by the Association for Learning Environments in 2004.

Early years  Cowan was born in New York City, the son of William Cowan, a confectioner of Scottish descent, and Julia Cowan, n√©e Palmer.  Stage  At 18, Cowan joined a travelling stock company, shortly afterwards enlisting in the United States Navy during World War I. After the war he returned to the stage and became a vaudeville headliner, then gained success on the New York stage. His Broadway debut was in We've Got to Have Money (1923). His other Broadway credits include Frankie and Johnnie (1930), Just to Remind You (1931), Rendezvous (1932), The Little Black Book (1932), Marathon (1933), Both Your Houses (1933), As Thousands Cheer (1933), Ladies' Money (1934), Paths of Glory (1935), Boy Meets Girl (1935), My Three Angels (1953), Lunatics and Lovers (1954), Rumple (1957), and Say, Darling (1958).  Film  He was spotted by Samuel Goldwyn and was given a film contract, his first film being Beloved Enemy. He appeared in more than one hundred films, but is probably best remembered for two roles in classic films: Miles Archer, the doomed private eye partner of Sam Spade in The Maltese Falcon and Thomas Mara, the hapless district attorney who has to prosecute Santa Claus in Miracle on 34th Street. Cowan also played Dagwood Bumstead's boss Mr. Radcliffe in several installments of Columbia Pictures' Blondie series. He also appeared in Deadline at Dawn, June Bride, and High Sierra.  Television  In 1959 he played Horatio Styles in the episode \\"Winter Song\\" of The Alaskans, with Roger Moore. That same year, he made two guest appearances in Perry Mason, starring Raymond Burr. He played murdered playwright Royce in \\"The Case of the Lost Last Act\\" and then Victor Latimore in \\"The Case of the Artful Dodger.\\" He also appeared in The Twilight Zone episode \\"The Sixteen-Millimeter Shrine\\" and guest-starred on Richard Diamond, Private Detective. In the 1960-1961 television season, Cowan starred as John Larsen, the owner of Comics, Inc., and the boss of Paul Morgan, a young cartoonist portrayed by Tab Hunter in The Tab Hunter Show. In 1962, he guest starred on Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. He also appeared on Daniel Boone and Going My Way, starring Gene Kelly. In 1964 and 1965, Cowan appeared as the demanding Herbert Wilson in The Tycoon. Earlier in 1963, he appeared on The Real McCoys in its final season on CBS. Death On January 24, 1972, Cowan died at Encino Hospital Medical Center in Encino, California at age 74. He was survived by his wife and two daughters. Recognition Cowan has a star at 6251 Hollywood Boulevard in the Television section of the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It was dedicated on February 8, 1960.

Deleted data can be recovered on many file systems, but not all file systems provide an undeletion feature. Recovering data without an undeletion facility is usually called data recovery, rather than undeletion. Although undeletion can help prevent users from accidentally losing data, it can also pose a computer security risk, since users may not be aware that deleted files remain accessible. Support Not all file systems or operating systems support undeletion. Undeletion is possible on all FAT file systems, with undeletion utilities provided since MS- DOS 5.0 and DR DOS 6.0 in 1991. It is not supported by most modern UNIX file systems, though AdvFS is a notable exception. The ext2 file system has an add- on program called e2undel which allows file undeletion. The similar ext3 file system does not officially support undeletion, but utilities like ext4magic, extundelete, PhotoRec and ext3grep was written to automate the undeletion on ext3 volumes. Undelete was proposed in ext4, but is yet to be implemented.New ext4 features However, a trash bin feature was posted as a patch on December 4, 2006. The Trash bin feature uses undelete attributes in ext2/3/4 and Reiser file systems. =Command-line tools= Norton Utilities Norton UNERASE was an important component in Norton Utilities version 1.0 in 1982. MS- DOS Microsoft included a similar UNDELETE program in versions 5.0 to 6.22 of MS-DOS, but applied the Recycle Bin approach instead in later operating systems using FAT. DR DOS DR DOS 6.0 and higher support UNDELETE as well, but optionally offer additional protection utilizing the FAT snapshot utility DISKMAP and the resident DELWATCH deletion tracking component, which actively maintains deleted files' date and time stamps and keeps the contents of deleted files from being overwritten unless running out of disk space. DELWATCH also supports undeletion of remote files on file servers. Since Novell DOS 7 the kernel will store the first letter of deleted files in the directory entries in order to further assist undeletion tools in recovering the original name. PTS-DOS PTS-DOS offers the same feature, configurable by a SAVENAME CONFIG.SYS directive. FreeDOS The FreeDOS version of UNDELETE was developed by Eric Auer and is licensed under the GPL.http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/micro/pc- stuff/freedos/files/distributions/1.2/repos/pkg-html/undelete.html =Graphical programs= Graphical user environments often take a different approach to undeletion, instead using a \\"holding area\\" for files to be deleted. Undesired files are moved to this holding area, and all of the files in the holding area are deleted periodically or when a user requests it. This approach is used by the Trash can in Macintosh operating systems and by the recycle bin in Microsoft Windows. This is a natural continuation of the approach taken by earlier systems, such as the limbo group used by LocoScript. This approach is not subject to the risk that other files being written to the filesystem will disrupt a deleted file very quickly; permanent deletion will happen on a predictable schedule or with manual intervention only. Another approach is offered by programs such as Norton GoBack (formerly Roxio GoBack): a portion of the hard disk space is set aside for file modification operations to be recorded in such a way that they may later be undone. This process is usually much safer in aiding recovery of deleted files than the undeletion operation as described below. Similarly, file systems that support \\"snapshots\\" (like ZFS or btrfs), can be used to make snapshots of the whole file system at regular intervals (e.g. every hour), thus allowing recovery of files from an earlier snapshot. Limitations Undeletion is not fail-safe. In general, the sooner undeletion is attempted, the more likely it will be successful. This is because the more a system is used, the more data is written to the drive and potentially allocated to that deleted space. Fragmentation of the deleted file may also reduce the probability of recovery, depending on the type of file system (see below). A fragmented file is scattered across different parts of the disk, instead of being in a contiguous area.  Mechanics  The workings of undeletion depend on the file system on which the deleted file was stored. Some file systems, such as HFS, cannot provide an undeletion feature because no information about the deleted file is retained (except by additional software, which is not usually present). Some file systems, however, do not erase all traces of a deleted file, including FAT file systems: = FAT file systems = When a file is \\"deleted\\" using a FAT file system, the directory entry remains almost unchanged except for the first character of the file name, preserving most of the \\"deleted\\" file's name, along with its time stamp, file length and ‚Äî most importantly ‚Äî its physical location on the disk. The list of disk clusters occupied by the file will, however, be erased from the File Allocation Table, marking those sectors available for use by other files created or modified thereafter. In case of FAT32, it is additionally erased field responsible for upper 16 bits of file start cluster value. When undeletion operation is attempted, the following conditions must be met for a successful recovery of the file: * The entry of the deleted file must still exist in the directory, meaning that it must not yet be overwritten by a new file (or folder) that has been created in the same directory. Whether this is the case can fairly easily be detected by checking whether the remaining name of the file to be undeleted is still present in the directory. * The clusters formerly used by the deleted file must not be overwritten yet by other files. This can fairly well be verified by checking that the clusters are not marked as used in the File Allocation Table. However, if, in the meantime, a new file had been written to the disk, using those sectors, and then deleted again, freeing those sectors again, this cannot be detected automatically by the undeletion program. In this case an undeletion operation, even if appearing successful, might fail because the recovered file contains different data. * For FAT32 devices, the lower 16 bits of the physical address is normally retained in the directory entry, but the high bits of the address are zeroed down. Many recovery programs ignore this fact and fail to recover data correctly. Chances of recovering deleted files is often higher on FAT12 and FAT16 as compared to FAT32 volumes due to the typically larger cluster sizes used by the former systems and due to loss of upper 16 bits of logical cluster address for FAT32. If the undeletion program cannot detect clear signs of the above requirements not being met, it will restore the directory entry as being in use and mark all consecutive clusters, beginning with the one as recorded in the old directory entry, as used in the File Allocation Table. It is then up to the user to open the recovered file and to verify that it contains the complete data of the formerly deleted file. Recovery of fragmented files (after the first fragment) is therefore not normally possible by automatic processes, only by manual examination of each (unused) block of the disk. This requires detailed knowledge of the file system, as well as the binary format of the file type being recovered, and is therefore only done by recovery specialists or forensics professionals. = NTFS file systems = NTFS stores file information as a set of fixed-size records (typically, 1KB) within the so-called Master File Table (MFT). File name and file allocation information are encapsulated into these records, providing complete information about each specific file. When the system deletes a file, the entry in the Master File Table is released to be either unlinked or reused, but it still remains on disk. Until the MFT entry is reused or overwritten, the file can be easily recovered: data recovery software can find the \\"lost\\" MFT entry and derive full information about the lost file from it. Note however, when the SSD TRIM function is enabled, file content may be destroyed shortly after deletion to reuse SSD memory cells. This makes file content recovery impossible (only name, date and file size information will remain on the disk). Prevention Data erasure is a term that refers to software-based methods of preventing file undeletion.

The song has since been covered by many artists, with the most famous cover being attributed to The Jackson 5. Jimmy Boyd original version The original recording by Jimmy Boyd, recorded on July 15, 1952, when he was 13 years old, reached No. 1 on the Billboard pop singles chart in December 1952, and on the Cash Box chart at the beginning of the following year. It later reached Number 3 in the UK Charts when issued there in November 1953. The song was commissioned by Saks Fifth Avenue to promote the store's Christmas card for the year, which featured an original sketch by artist Perry Barlow, who drew for The New Yorker for many decades. The song describes a scene where a child walks downstairs from his bedroom on Christmas Eve to see the mother kissing \\"Santa Claus\\" under the mistletoe. The lyric concludes with the child wondering how his father will react on hearing of the kiss, little knowing it is in fact his father in the Santa costume. Boyd's record was condemned by the Roman Catholic Church in Boston when it was released on the grounds that it mixed kissing with Christmas. Boyd was photographed meeting with the Archdiocese to explain the song. After the meeting, the ban was lifted.  Spike Jones version  A less successful version of the song was released in 1952 by Spike Jones (with vocal by George Rock in the little boy voice used in Spike's hit \\"All I Want For Christmas Is My Two Front Teeth\\"). Jones also recorded a parody for his personal pleasure titled \\"I Saw Mommy Screwing Santa Claus.\\"  Cover versions  Popular versions of the song were released by the Ronettes, Molly Bee, Bobby Sherman, Andy Williams, The Beverley Sisters, The Four Seasons, The Jackson 5, Reba McEntire, Homer and Jethro, Amy Winehouse, John Mellencamp, Mitch Miller, John Prine, Sammi Sanchez, Tiny Tim, The Cheetah Girls, Ray Stevens, Bif Naked, Jessica Simpson, Teresa Brewer, Rica Fukami, Secret Chiefs 3 and Dionne Bromfield have also covered it. The Dollyrots recorded a variation (titled \\"I Saw Mommy Biting Santa Claus\\") with humorous lyrics. RuPaul and Kip Addotta both recorded versions with changed lyrics titled \\"I Saw Daddy Kissing Santa Claus.\\" Twisted Sister recorded their own variation of the song onto their album A Twisted Christmas. John Mellencamp also filmed a music video to promote his recording for the 1987 Special Olympics charity album, A Very Special Christmas. On December 14, 2019, Saturday Night Live sketch featured a version of I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus. It was sung by Cecily Strong portraying a child, it also featured Scarlett Johansson as mother, Beck Bennett as Santa Claus, and Mikey Day as father. In addition, the sketch added extra lyrics implying that the singer's parents have a cuckolding fetish. = International versions = * Danish: \\"Jeg s√• julemanden kysse mor\\" (Danish text: Susanne Palsbo) * Finnish: \\"Kun joulupukki suukon sai\\" (Finnish text: Saukki) * French: \\"J'ai vu maman embrasser le P√®re No√´l\\" (French text: Louis Gast√©) * Norwegian: \\"Jeg s√• mamma kysse nissen\\" (Norwegian text: Philip A.

She was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for her novel Persian Nights in 1988. Career Born Diane Lain in Moline, Illinois, Johnson has authored books including Lulu in Marrakech (2008), L'Affaire (2003), Le Mariage (2000) and Le Divorce (1997), for which she was a National Book Award finalist and the winner of the California Book Award gold medal for fiction. Her memoir Flyover Lives was released in January 2014. She has been a frequent contributor to The New York Review of Books since the mid-1970s. With filmmaker Stanley Kubrick, Johnson co-authored the screenplay to The Shining (1980), based on the horror novel of the same name by Stephen King. In 2003, Le Divorce, a film adaptation of her 1997 comedy of manners novel of the same name, was released, directed by James Ivory and starred Kate Hudson and Naomi Watts. Personal life Johnson attended Stephens College, a small women's college in Missouri. In her sophomore year she entered the Mademoiselle magazine Guest Editor contest and was selected as one of 20 women from across the United States to work on the magazine for a month in New York City in 1953. The month at the magazine would prove to be formative in her eventual career as a writer. Another member of the group was Sylvia Plath who would write about the experience in her 1963 novel The Bell Jar. Johnson shadowed the Health and Beauty editor and was responsible for answering readers' questions about makeup. In a piece she wrote for the September 2003 edition of Vogue magazine, Johnson said: \\"I still have a strong memory of Plath's white straw beret, her blonde pageboy and cheerful face. (None of us understood the anguish of her secret life, though maybe the editors did, for they treated her carefully, the one most destined to succeed.)\\" In the Vogue article, Johnson wrote the month at Mademoiselle and her exposure to Plath taught her a key lesson. \\"I realized that if you took pains with your writing, you could make art, and that the rather facile little stories I had dashed off for my English classes or the school magazine were probably not art. It was, in fact, the example of \\"Sunday at the Mintons',\\" Sylvia Plath's winning story in the Guest Editor contest, that made that point to me and changed my life, though not immediately.\\" Johnson went on to say, \\"Writing was a serious form of work, and to be serious, like those New York editors, you had to send in your stories. Writers and editors were embarked on a consequential enterprise, the business of literature and books. What happiness to have been taught that lesson; I did send in my novels.\\" That same year, 1953, Johnson married B. Lamar Johnson Jr.. Within eight years, she had given birth to four children with him: Kevin, Darcy, Amanda, and Simon. In the Vogue article she wrote, \\"Novel-writing would become my refuge during moments snatched during their naps and play visits. New York..came to symbolize a road not taken, but I was not sorry, exactly, for if I had stayed in New York, I probably would not have done my writing.\\" After separating from and divorcing Johnson, in 1968 she married John Frederic Murray, a physician who became chief of pulmonary and critical care at San Francisco General Hospital. After Murray's retirement, the two divided their time between homes in Paris, where Murray died of COVID-19 on March 24,2020 at the age of 92, and San Francisco.

Early life Henry Lionel Gallwey was born on 25 September 1859 at Alverstoke, Hampshire, England, to Lieutenant General Thomas Lionel Gallwey and his second wife, Alicia Dorinda Lefanu, n√©e MacDougall. He was educated at Cheltenham College. Military career After attending the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, Gallwey was commissioned in 1878. He served as an aide-de-camp to the governors of Bermuda, being promoted to captain in 1887. Gallwey was appointed deputy commissioner and vice-consul in the newly established Oil Rivers Protectorate (later the Niger Coast Protectorate) in 1891. In March 1892, he failed to convince the King of Benin, Omo n‚ÄôOba Ovonramwen, into signing a deceptive 'treaty of friendship' that would make Benin a British colony. Instead, the King issued an edict barring all British officials and traders from entering Benin territories. The 'Gallwey Treaty', although it was never signed, became the legal basis for the British invasion, occupation, and looting, culminating in the Benin Expedition of 1897, which destroyed the Kingdom of Benin. Gallwey was often mentioned in despatches during this time, and was rewarded with the Distinguished Service Order (DSO; 1896), appointment as Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG; 1899) and promotion to major (1897). Gallwey was attached as a political officer to the staff of the British Field Force during the Aro-Anglo war from November 1901 until March 1902 and was mentioned in despatches by the High Commissioner to Southern Nigeria. Given the rank of lieutenant colonel when he was placed on half-pay in 1901, Gallwey retired from the army in 1902. Governorships After retiring from the army, Gallwey was appointed as governor of the island of Saint Helena, where he revived capital punishment. Appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in 1910, he was transferred to Gambia in 1911. Galway was appointed Governor of South Australia in 1914. He resented the limitations placed upon a constitutional governor, and his governorship was defined by controversy. He managed to anger a wide spectrum of the population. The general public disliked his support of compulsory military training; puritans were angered by his support for gambling and his opposition to prohibition; progressives were infuriated by his opposition to women's enfranchisement; and the political establishment were aghast at his opposition to the White Australia Policy (on the grounds that the Northern Territory needed Asian workers). For this last opinion, he was forced to issue a full retraction and apology. A speech in 1915 in which Galway suggested that trade unionists should be conscripted and sent to the front was widely criticised and gave local cartoonists a field day. It was eventually Galway's support for conscription that saved his governorship; the legislature decided that his efforts to increase voluntary recruitment for the First World War, as well as his support for conscription referendums, warranted keeping him in the role. A motion in the legislature by the Labor opposition in 1917 calling for the abolition of his office failed. After the war, Premier Archibald Peake was considering a proposal to build a national war memorial on the site of Government House, with a new vice-regal residence to be purchased in the suburbs. Galway managed to dissuade Peake from this scheme, and the war memorial was built in a corner of the grounds of Government House. Galway's appointment was not renewed when it expired in 1920; although he was liked by the Adelaide establishment, he had been a spectacularly controversial governor, and the Colonial Office did not give him another post. He returned to England later in 1920. Personal life In 1911, Gallwey changed his surname to \\"Galway\\". On 26 August 1913 in London he married Baroness Marie Carola Franciska Roselyne d'Erlanger. He died on 17 June 1949.

Founding of BBDO In 1919, Osborn joined with Bruce Fairchild Barton and Roy Sarles Durstine to form the BDO advertising agency. Osborn acted as manager of BDO's Buffalo branch. He was largely responsible for the 1928 merger of BDO (Barton, Durstine & Osborn) with the George Batten Company to create BBDO. After years of success and having survived the Great Depression, BBDO underwent a crisis in 1938, losing many of its clients and key personnel. Osborn commuted to New York City and eventually saved the company by securing the Goodrich tire account. In 1939, he became BBDO's executive vice president after Durstine resigned. Osborn was crucial in recruiting many top employees, including Ben Duffy, who eventually became the president of BBDO. Creativity theorist Osborn became increasingly active as an author, and published several books on creative thinking. In his 1942 book How To Think Up he presented the technique of \\"brainstorming\\", which had been used at BBDO. Eventually, Osborn's writing career overtook his work in advertising, and in 1960, after more than forty years, he resigned from BBDO's board of directors. In 1954, Osborn set up the Creative Education Foundation, sustained by the royalties earned from his books. Along with Sidney Parnes, Osborn developed the \\"Osborn-Parnes Creative Problem Solving Process\\" (commonly referred to as CPS). He co-founded the Creative Education Foundation's Creative Problem Solving Institute, the world's longest-running international creativity conference, and CPS has been taught for more than 50 years.

Among her songs, \\"Bello e impossibile\\" (1986) was an international hit in Austria, Germany, Italy and Switzerland. Early life Nannini was born in Siena on 14 July 1956. She is the older sister of former Formula One racing driver Alessandro Nannini. She studied piano and composition in Milan in the late 1970s and obtained a degree in Philosophy from the University of Siena in 1994. The following year she took part in a protest organized by Greenpeace at the French embassy in Rome against the decision of the French government to pursue nuclear experiments at Mururoa. Musical career Nannini performing in 2017 Nannini scored her first domestic hit in 1979 with the single \\"America\\" and the album California, which became a success in several European countries. Her international breakthrough happened in 1984 with the release of her sixth album, the Conny Plank-produced Puzzle, which peaked in the top 10 in the Italian, German, Austrian and Swiss charts. The first single from the album, \\"Fotoromanza\\", was supported by a music video directed by Michelangelo Antonioni, and went on to win many musical awards. Nannini embarked on a long European tour to support the album, culminating in a headlining gig at the Montreux Jazz Festival.

With this orchestra Nannini went on a European tour from 2004 to 2005. The album Grazie was released in February 2006, and peaked at number one of the Italian hit-parade with the single \\"Sei nell'anima\\". In April 2007, Nannini released Pia come la canto io, a collection of songs produced by Wil Malone and originally intended for a rock opera based on the medieval Tuscan character Pia de' Tolomei (briefly mentioned in Dante's Purgatorio) that would eventually be performed in 2008 after eleven years of gestation. An acoustic version of her song Meravigliosa Creatura (from Perle) has been used in a 2008 advertisement commercial for the Fiat Bravo directed by Matthias Zentner. Fiat would later include another Gianna Nannini song, \\"Aria\\", in a subsequent Fiat Bravo ad. =Duets= In 1987 she performed with Sting and Jack Bruce the \\"Three Penny Opera\\" by Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill at the Schauspielhaus in Hamburg.

The format is similar to that of Pac-Man: the player moves around a fixed rectilinear lattice, attempting to visit each location on the board while avoiding the enemies. When each spot has been visited, the player moves to the next level. The game and its name have their roots in the Japanese lot drawing game Amidakuji. The bonus level in Amidar is a nearly exact replication of an Amidakuji game and the way the enemies move conform to the Amidakuji rules; this is referred to in the attract sequence as \\"Amidar movement.\\" Amidar was the first in the grid capture sub-genre of maze games and was highly cloned in arcades and for home systems. Gameplay The player engaging a sequence. As in Pac-Man, the player is opposed by enemies who kill on contact. The enemies gradually increase in number as the player advances from one level to the next, and their speed also increases. On odd-numbered levels, the player controls an ape (in some versions labeled \\"Copier\\"), and must collect coconuts while avoiding headhunters (labeled \\"Police\\" and \\"Thief\\"). On even-numbered levels, the player controls a paint roller (labeled \\"Rustler\\"), and must paint over each spot of the board while avoiding pigs (labeled \\"Cattle\\" and \\"Thief\\"). Each level is followed by a short bonus stage. Whenever a rectangular portion of the board is cleared (either by collecting all surrounding coconuts, or painting all surrounding edges), the rectangle is colored in, and in the even levels, bonus points are awarded (In odd-numbered levels, the player collects points for each coconut eaten). When the player clears all four corners of the board, he is briefly empowered to kill the enemies by touching them (just as when Pac-Man uses a \\"power pill\\"). Enemies killed in this way fall to the bottom of the screen and revitalise themselves after a few moments. The game controls consist of a joystick and a single button labeled \\"Jump,\\" which can be used up to three times, resetting after a level is cleared or the player loses a life. Pressing the jump button does not cause the player to jump, but causes all the enemies to jump, enabling the player to walk under them. Extra lives are given at 50,000 points, and per 80,000 scored up to 930,000; after that, no more lives. =Enemy movement= The enemies (and bonus stage pigs) in Amidar move deterministically; this is described in the game as \\"Amidar movement\\". Each normal-type enemy moves vertically from the top to the bottom of the screen, and then back to the top, and so on. While moving in a constant vertical direction, the enemy will take every horizontal turn available until they reach the top or bottom of the grid, when they will continue to move either left or right in the direction they are headed and then take the first vertical turn available to re-enter the game board. This ensures that, while the movement of the enemies can be predicted and avoided, there are no safe points on the grid in which the player can stay still for too long. Each level has one special enemy (the \\"Tracer\\", colored white) which, at the beginning of each stage, simply patrols around the perimeter of the gameboard in an anti-clockwise direction. However, following a certain number of \\"laps\\", The Tracer will begin to relentlessly pursue the player by following the path their on-screen avatar takes. While the Tracer cannot deviate from following the player's exact route, it does not mimic any pauses the player makes, meaning that hesitations or backtracking will eventually allow the Tracer to catch up and kill the player. Later levels increase difficulty by adding more complex game grids, adding more enemies, and reducing the delay before the Tracer begins pursuit, until eventually it gives chase after a single lap at the beginning of each stage. =Level differences= In the even-numbered levels where the player controls a paint roller, the roller cannot move too far from grid rectangles that have already been filled without running out of paint and having to return to completed parts of the map to refresh its supply. When this happens, any painted lines which are not part of a filled rectangle will vanish and must be painted again. In practical terms, this means that the player must build their completed squares around the starting point of the level (which always has a fresh supply of paint) and spread outwards, rather than completing squares in any part of the game board they please, as they can on the odd-numbered levels. This also makes filling the corner rectangles and becoming invincible more difficult. Ports Atari 2600 version. The player is the white sprite at right. Amidar was published by Parker Bros. for the Atari 2600 in 1982 and the Casio PV-1000 console in 1983. Gakken released a handheld version of Amidar in 1982. It was one of a series of three flip-top games with VFD screen and magnifying Fresnel lens. Legacy Numerous clones and spins on Amidar have been written. A reskinned version, Spiderdroid, was published for the Atari 2600 in 1987 by Froggo. A clone was published as Omidar by Profiteam/M&T; for the Commodore 64 in 1987. Time Runner is an Amidar-like game for the TRS-80, Atari 8-bit family, and C64. Triple Punch is a horizontally scrolling version of the Amidar concept.  Competition  There are two ROM sets for Amidar: a harder version distributed by Stern and an easier set created by Konami.

His first (and best known thanks to a successful film adaptation) appearance occurs in the 1977 novel Firefox as a US Air Force major that steals a Russian MiG-31 Firefox fighter aircraft prototype. The prototype uses experimental interfaces between pilot and plane to allow for \\"thought- activated\\" flying and combat solutions. Gant, however, has to think in Russian to enable the technology to work. Character biography Gant grew up in Clarksville, a small town in rural America and found himself drawn to flight when as a child after seeing a small airplane land at a local gas station in need of fuel. With few happy memories of Clarksville, Gant found his way into the United States Air Force, becoming a fighter pilot. While flying combat during the Vietnam War, Gant's F-4 Phantom II was shot down by a surface-to- air missile. Gant ejected and was immediately captured, apparently by guerrillas. The arrival of allied aircraft saves Gant, but also traumatizes him - napalm dropped by one of the aircraft incinerates a young girl travelling with the enemy soldiers. The experience left him with post- traumatic stress disorder, causing him to have frequent flashbacks. He suffers from a recurring nightmare about himself being a Vietnamese and burning in napalm dropped by US aircraft. After the war, he leaves the military and is recruited by the CIA and works for some time in a menial job in a Los Angeles pizza restaurant while shadowing a KGB cell. Later, he becomes a handyman, a drunk and a hobo. Eventually he is re-recruited by the CIA for their Firefox operation, supposedly because of his knowledge of Russian, his combat experience in Vietnam and his knowledge of flying Russian aircraft; he is already fluent in Russian (his mother was Russian) therefore only requires 3 months of training, learning to fly a replica MiG-25 as well as a simulator of the Firefox. Appearances In Firefox, an Anglo-American intelligence scheme inserts Gant into the Soviet Union in order for him to steal one of the two prototypes of a revolutionary fighter plane, the MiG-31, NATO code name \\"Firefox\\" (not to be confused with the real MiG-31, a development of the MiG-25). After crossing the Soviet Union from Moscow to the airbase where the Firefox is being developed, with the help of various MI6 agents and several false identities; dissident scientists involved in the project create a diversion allowing Gant to steal the plane. He then deals with several obstacles and, after dispatching the second prototype in a dogfight, has apparently succeeded in his theft. In Firefox Down, the immediate sequel to Firefox, Gant realizes that he has not survived his dogfight with the second MiG-31 unscathed. Leaking fuel from a punctured fuel tank, and forced to burn more when confronted by two MiG-25's, Gant is forced to land the MiG-31 on a lake in Finland very close to the Soviet border. The Soviets capture Gant, but not before the plane sinks into the frozen Finnish lake. The Soviets use brainwashing to determine whether the MiG-31 crashed or landed. Gant escapes from the KGB and with the help of a Russian double agent named Anna Akhmerovna, the Soviet Union as well. Gant and Anna are reluctantly assisted by Dmitri Priabin, a KGB officer who is also Anna's lover. Anna is shot as Gant crosses the border. Gant meets up with a team of western intelligence experts that have recovered the MiG-31 from under the Finnish ice, but have not been able to move it to safety. Gant successfully flies the plane home, even though immersion under water has damaged the plane's radar-invisibility. Gant's next role was in the novel Winter Hawk. Originally, Gant's mission was to smuggle scientist and spy Filip Kedrov out of the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, as Kedrov had information on a Soviet spaceborne directed-energy weapon. However, Gant and Kedrov were both captured by the KGB. Dmitri Priabin, the ranking head of the KGB, still holds a vendetta against Gant due to the death of Anna Akhmerovna. When he learns, however, of a plot by the Soviet military to take control of the Soviet space weapon and use it against an American Space Shuttle, Priabin is again forced to ally himself with Gant in order to warn his civilian superiors in Moscow. With the Soviet Army imposing a security crackdown on Baikonur, even upon the KGB, Gant and Priabin escape Baikonur in a KGB helicopter. Shot down by Soviet helicopters, Gant is forced to escape again with evidence of the Soviet weapon - first on foot, then in a stolen An-2 cropduster, then again on foot when the An-2 is shot down near the Turkish border. Eluding a manhunt by Soviet Paratroopers, Gant is extracted by US Army helicopters. Gant's final appearance comes in the novel A Different War, in which he is a member of the National Transportation Safety Board. In this novel, he investigates the crashes of two examples of a fictional airliner, and discovers that they were both sabotaged by a former CIA agent working for a rival aircraft manufacturer. In the epilogue, it is mentioned that Gant was awarded a Medal of Honor following the events of the novel. It is also revealed that he was an F-117 Nighthawk pilot and instructor during the Persian Gulf War.

In this role, the Band will be front and centre at the Annual Church Parade, the Headmaster's Parade, and the Annual Inspection in May. The Cadet Corps closely resembles that of the Canadian army. Beginning from grade 8, all students at St. Andrew's must participate in the Cadet program. Those who wish to further pursue their leadership position in the Cadet Corps can either become platoon instructors or apply for senior positions within the corps. There are four mandatory levels in the cadet program, which accompanies each grade, and they are as follows: *Green Star (grade 8) - if the student passes the final Green Star exam, he will be promoted from a cadet to a lance corporal. *Red Star (grade 9) - if the student passes the final Red Star exam, he will be promoted from a private to a corporal. *Silver Star (grade 10) - if the student passes the final Silver Star exam, he will be promoted from a corporal to a master corporal. *Gold Star (grade 11) - if the student passes the final Gold Star exam, he will be promoted from a master corporal to a sergeant. As well, the St. Andrew's College Cadet Corps has won a multitude of awards. It won the Strathcona Cup for general efficiency of private school cadet corps in 1944, 1945, 1947, 1954, 1955, 1961, 1964, 1967, 1973, 1980, 1981 and 1983. Moreover, it won the Earl Grey Challenge Trophy for the Best Cadet Corps in Canada in 1960-1961. =Rank structure= Similar to the Canadian Forces, a Cadet can be promoted on merit gained through Cadet accreditation and leadership within the corps. The rank structure is equivalent to that of the Royal Canadian Army Cadets; the Cadet Corps is one of only a few Cadet Corps in Canada which still keeps Cadets officers ranks. =Piping and drumming= In addition to the normal Cadet Corps, the Pipes and Drums Band are also paramount to the School's Cadet Corps. Internationally renowned as \\"North America's piping heartland\\" for its Piping and Drumming program, St. Andrew's College attracts hundreds of potential pipers each year to its summer \\"Ontario School of Piping and Drumming at St. Andrew‚Äôs College\\" camp. Like the Cadets in the Royal Canadian Army Cadets program, pipers and drummers can elevate their rank in the same way that the normal school Cadets do. In June 2019, the decision was made to field a competitive band in grade 3 alongside the existing band, which competed in grade 5. School events Each year, St. Andrew's hosts' certain events that are special only to the School. Some of these activities and events involve the School's entire student body, while others invite alumni and their friends and families. These events serve different purposes, some of which are integral to the School's identity while others are used for fundraising causes. Picture of the School's first cadet corps in 1905. *Annual Cadet Inspection - the annual Cadet Inspection is mandatory for the entire student body at St. Andrew's. The Inspection is usually held in May and invites prominent representatives from all across Canada to inspect the School's student body. A tradition that finds its root since 1906, the annual inspection is integral to the School's identity and preserving the School's Scottish background. *Cadets in Concert - This musical concert showcases the School's Pipes and Drums and feature the Corps Concert Band, Stage Band and a few outstanding soloists, percussionists and dancers. It highlights traditional Celtic music, military band music, and some show tunes. *Andrean Christmas - The annual Andrean Christmas is held at Roy Thompson Hall in midtown Toronto in December and showcases the School‚Äôs musicians and singers. The Hall holds over 2,000 people and is generally filled to capacity. Like the annual Cadet Inspection, the Andrean Christmas is mandatory and everybody from the student body must attend. *Focus Festival of the Arts - This program is a three-day festival of plays, a film festival, visual arts, music and social events for students, parents and guests. Boys who have never been involved in drama or on the stage before are encouraged to participate by writing their own plays, directing, producing or acting in performances large and small. *Homecoming - an annual gathering of all St. Andrew's alumni to return to St. Andrew's in September. Held in conjunction with the 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45 reunion dinners, this annual gathering is for the entire Andrean community. The Homecoming celebration includes games for the children in the Quad and in the Great Hall, and various sports competitions, especially soccer and football. For Upper School students, the Homecoming event usually includes the annual Homecoming dance on Saturday evening. *MacPherson Tournament - an annual hockey event where the St. Andrew's varsity hockey team competes with hockey teams from other top schools for the MacPherson Cup. The cup is named after three Andreans: Lloyd MacPherson, Jim Hamilton and Bob Meagher, all of whom loved hockey with passion and contributed greatly to the St. Andrew's hockey team. The tournament has a North American flavour, hosting schools from Saskatchewan, New Brunswick, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Quebec, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Florida, New York, Nova Scotia and Michigan as well as a variety of regions in Ontario.History *Prize Day - Prize Day is the culmination of the School's academic year, and features many awards and prizes earned by the School's students. There are two ceremonies, one for the Middle School and one for the Upper School. Prize Day takes place after exams, which are usually completed by early June. *St. Andrew's Dinner - every November, a traditional St. Andrew's night dinner is held, complete with Haggis. All students must attend, wearing their kilts for this special occasion. Like the annual Cadet Inspection, the St. Andrew's Dinner has taken place since the inception of the School and is integral to the preservation of the School's Scottish traditions. *Annual Fall Play - An annual play put on for parents, students, and staff during the month of November. Generally a Musical. Clans Middle School Clans: *Bruce Clan *Douglas Clan *Wallace Clan *Montrose Clan Students in a particular Upper School house, both day and boarding, are in the same clan.

The photographs of each year‚Äôs representative teams line the walls along the first and second floors of the Bedard Athletic Centre. Sports are mandatory ‚Äî all Upper School boys must participate in two out of three sports terms during the year, while Middle School students must participate in all three terms. St. Andrew's has a tradition of sporting, as shown by its participation in both private and public school leagues and associations: *Private schools competition *Little Big Four (L.B.F.) 1899-1968 *Independent School League (I.S.L.) 1968-1982 *Independent Schools Athletic Association (I.S.A.A.) 1982-1993 *Conference of Independent Schools Athletic Association (C.I.S.A.A.)1993‚Äìpresent *Canadian Association of Independent Schools (C.A.I.S.) 1981‚Äìpresent *Public schools competition *York Region Secondary Schools Athletic Association (Y.R.S.S.A.A.) 1971-1995 *Georgian Bay Secondary Schools Athletic Association (G.B.S.S.A.A.) 1973-1986 *Durham-York Secondary Schools Athletic Association (D.Y.S.S.A.A.) 1986-1995 *York Region Athletic Association (Y.R.A.A.) 1995-2004 *Ontario Federation of School Athletic Associations (O.F.S.A.A.) 1948‚Äìpresent St. Andrew's College has teams for the following sports: =Fall= *Football *Cross Country *Soccer *Volleyball *Ultimate Frisbee =Winter= *Alpine Skiing *Basketball *Biathlon *Curling *Fencing *Hockey *Nordic Skiing *Squash *Swimming *Table tennis =Spring= *Badminton *Baseball *Cricket *Golf *Lacrosse *Rugby *Tennis *Track and field *Triathlon Headmasters *Reverend George Bruce (1899‚Äì1900) *Reverend Bruce Macdonald (1900‚Äì1935) *Kenneth Ketchum (1935‚Äì1958) *Dr. Joseph Robert Coulter (1958‚Äì1974) *Dr. Thomas Hockin (1974‚Äì1981) *Robert B√©dard (1981‚Äì1997) *E.G.

Inchkeith has had a colourful history as a result of its proximity to Edinburgh and strategic location for use as home for Inchkeith Lighthouse and for military purposes defending the Firth of Forth from attack from shipping, and more recently protecting the upstream Forth Bridge and Rosyth Dockyard. Inchkeith has, by some accounts, been inhabited (intermittently) for almost 1,800 years. Geography and climate Although most of the island is of volcanic origin, the island's geology is surprisingly varied. As well as the igneous rock, there are also some sections of sandstone, shale, coal and limestone. The shale contains a great number of fossils. There are several springs on the island. The island has the lowest average rainfall in Scotland at annually. The island has an abundance of springs, as noted by James Grant. James Boswell noted two wells on the island during his visit, and speculated as to the former existence of a third within the Castle. History Inchkeith from Portobello, Edinburgh. Inchkeith from Kinghorn, Fife =Etymology= The name \\"Inchkeith\\" may derive from the medieval Scottish Gaelic Innse Coit, meaning \\"wooded island\\".William J. Watson, Celtic Place-Names of Scotland, (Edinburgh, 1926), new ed. (Edinburgh, 2004), p. 382. The latter element coit, in Old Welsh coet, is from the Proto-Celtic *cƒìto-, \\"wood\\". The late 9th century Sanas Cormaic, authored by Cormac mac Cuilenn√°in, suggests that the word had disappeared from the Gaelic of Ireland by that period, becoming coill; he states \\"coit coill isin chombric\\", that is, \\"coit is Welsh for wood\\", and explains that the Irish place-name Sailchoit is partly derived from Welsh.William J. Watson, Celtic Place-Names of Scotland, p. 381. Although Scottish Gaelic was closer to Brythonic than Irish was, the Life of St Serf (written before 1180) calls the island Insula Ke√∞, suggesting the possibility that the specific element in Inchkeith was not comprehensible to that hagiography's anonymous author or translator; if we could be sure that the author was Scottish, rather than an English or French incomer, this could be taken to mean that the word was probably not comprehensible even in Fife Gaelic in the 12th century.The work contains a number of place-names with good Gaelic orthography; see Alan Macquarrie, \\"Life of St Serf\\", in the Innes Review, vol. 44, no. 2 (Autumn, 1993), pp. 122-52. Since Gaelic had all but disappeared as a language spoken natively in southern Fife by the mid-14th century,Simon Taylor, \\"Babbet and Bridin Pudding or Polyglot Fife in the Middle Ages\\", in Nomina, 17 (1994), pp. 99‚Äì118. there is no continuous Gaelic tradition for the name, but the modern form is Innis Cheith.See St√≤r-d√†ta Briathrachais G√†idhlig - R√πrachadh, sv \\"Innis Cheith\\". Such a rocky and exposed island can however never have supported many trees so it would be reasonable that the derivation may be otherwise. Early associations between Saint Adomn√°n and the island may indicate that the second element is derived from the name of his contemporary and associate Coeddi (or C√©ti), bishop of Iona. =Earliest history= Almost nothing is known about the early history of Inchkeith, and there is no certain reference to the island until the 12th century. In the days when people were compelled to cross the Firth of Forth by boat as opposed to bridge, the island was a great deal less isolated, and on the ferry routes between Leith/Lothian and Fife. Like nearby Inchcolm and the Isle of May, Inchkeith was attacked repeatedly by English raiders in the 14th century. This was the period when the Scottish Wars of Independence were in full swing, and decisive battles were being fought in the Lothians and in the Stirling/Bannockburn region, and so the island was effectively in the route of any supply or raiding vessels. It is unknown who owned Inchkeith from the 8th century onward, but it is known that it was the property of the Crown until granted to Lord Glamis. =Inchkeith as quarantine= In 1497, the island was (along with Inchgarvie, a few miles away) used as an isolated refuge for victims of 'grandgore' (also spelled 'glandgore'), an old Scots name for 'syphilis', in Edinburgh. The 'grandgor' was recognised in the 1497 Minutes of the Town Council of Edinborough (Phil. Trans. XLII. 421) \\"This contagious sickness callit the Grandgor.\\". The Grandgore Act was passed in September 1497, causing Inchkeith, as well as other islands in the Firth, such as Inchgarvie, to be made a place of \\"Compulsory Retirement\\" for people suffering from this disease. They were told to board a ship at Leith and once there, \\"to remain till God provide for their health\\". It is probable that they all died. In 1589, history repeated itself and the island was used to quarantine the passengers of a plague-ridden ship. More plague sufferers came here from the mainland in 1609. In 1799, Russian sailors who died of an infectious disease were buried here. =James IV's linguistic experiment= During the reign of James IV of Scotland, Inchkeith was allegedly the site of a language deprivation experiment. Robert Lyndsay of Pitscottie wrote in a chronicle that in 1493, James IV directed that a mute woman and two infants be transported to the island, in order to ascertain which language the infants would grow up to speak isolated from the rest of the world. This speech, in contemporary theory, would be the \\"original\\" language, or the \\"language of God\\". Pitscottie's version of the story, written in Scots language and given here in modern spelling beneath, was; > \\"And also the king gart tak ane dum woman and pat hir in Inchekeytht and > gaif hir tua young bairnes in companie witht hir, and gart furnische them of > all necessar thingis pertening to thair nourischment that is to say, meit, > drink, fyre and candell, claithis, with all uther kynd of necessaris quhilk > (is) requyrit to man or woman, desyrand the effect heirof to come to knaw > quhat langage (or, \\"leid\\") thir bairnes wald speik quhene they cam to > lauchfull aige. Some sayis they spak goode Hebrew; bot as to myself I knaw > not bot be the authoris reherse\\" > > In modern English: \\"The king ordered a mute woman to be put on Inchkeith and > gave her two young children in company with her, and provided them with > everything they would need for their nourishment, food, drink, fire and > candle, clothes, and all other kinds of necessities needed by man or woman. > He was desirous to discover what language the children would speak when they > came of proper age. Some say they spoke good Hebrew, but I myself know no > more than my sources say.Aeneas James George Mackay, Robert Lindsay of > Pitscottie, Historie and Chroniclis of Scotland, vol. 1 (Scottish Text > Society: Edinburgh, 1899), p. 237. However, there are no contemporary sources or documents describing such an experiment, and modern historians consider the story implausible.Robin N Campbell & Robert Grieve (12/1981). Royal Investigations of the Origin of Language. Historiographia Linguistica 9(1-2):43-74 DOI: 10.1075/hl.9.1-2.04cam James IV took a boat from Leith to the island on 20 June 1502 and went on to Kinghorn.James Balfour Paul, Accounts of the Treasurer, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1900), p. 151. =Rough Wooing, Reformation, and the 17th century= In the 16th century, the island suffered further English depredation during the war of the Rough Wooing. The General Duke of Somerset garrisoned the island in 1547 after the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh. His force of marines was ordered to reinforce the island, so they built a large square fort, with corner towers, on the site of the present day lighthouse. A French soldier, Jean de Beaugu√©, described how the building works were visible from Leith in June 1548. De Beaugu√© wrote that four companies of English soldiers and a company of Italians were ordered to help the English workmen, who were \\"pioneers\\" not soldiers.Abercromby, trans, Jean de Beaugu√©'s History of the Campagnes in Scotland, (1707), p.114 The English admiral Edward Fiennes de Clinton anchored his fleet at Inchkeith in August 1548. His task was to prevent sea traffic in the Forth and the security of the English at the siege of Haddington. Clinton reported destroying 38 ships on 9 August 1548. French galleys lay off Burntisland. His duty in the Forth prevented him coming to aid John Luttrell at Broughty CastleCameron, Annie, Scottish Correspondence of Mary of Lorraine (Edinburgh, 1927), pp. 264-7 The garrison was ejected by a combined Franco- Scottish force under General D‚ÄôEss√© (Andr√© de Montalembert, Sieur de Ess√©) on 19 or 29 June 1549.Marcus Merriman, The Rough Wooings (Tuckwell, 2000), p. 341.\\"Capture of Inchkeith\\".

On the following day, Mary of Guise, the regent, visited the island, to see the \\"three and four hundred of her dead foes still unburied\\". Since 29 June was F√™te Dieu in France, she renamed the island \\"L‚Äô√éle de Dieu\\". The soldiers also nicknamed it \\"L‚Äô√éle des Chevaux\\" (The island of horses). Neither name stuck. Seven English banners captured on the island were sent to Henri II of France. On 17 July 1549, he gave the soldiers who brought the banners lifetime pensions.Calendar State Papers Spain, vol. 9 (London, 1912), p. 404. On 22 June Regent Arran's Privy Council ordered that all the towns and burghs on both sides of the Forth should contribute a workforce of 400 men to strengthen the fortifications, and pay their wages of two shillings for 16 days.Register of the Privy Council, Addenda, vol. 14, p. 8 After the end of the war of the Rough Wooing, the island was occupied by the French, under Mary of Guise, during her period as the Regent of Scotland between 1554 and 1560. The old English fortifications were further strengthened by the Scots and French, who under D‚ÄôEss√© built a larger and stronger fort. The works were directed by the Italian architect and military engineer Lorenzo Pomarelli.Amadio Ronchini, 'Lorenzo Pomarelli' in Atti e memorie delle RR. Deputazioni di storia patria per le provincie Modenesi e Parmensi (Modena, 1868), pp. 264-5. Accounts for this rebuilding written in French survive with the names of the Scottish craftsmen and women who worked there in 1555.National Archives of Scotland, The French-born gunner and carpenter Andrew Mansioun supervised a team of twenty three horses on the island.Michael Pearce, 'A French Furniture Maker and the 'Courtly Style' in Sixteenth-Century Scotland', Regional Furniture vol. XXXII (2018), p. 131. Further construction work in 1558 was supervised by the master of work, William MacDowall.James Balfour Paul, Accounts of the Treasurer, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1913), pp. 431-4. During the siege of Leith, the English commander Grey of Wilton obtained a description of the fortress as it stood on 17 April 1560. The wall and rampart was 30 feet thick, being 14 feet of stone behind 16 feet of earth. There were 140 French soldiers with 70 women, boys and labourers. As the English admiral William Wynter was trying to blockade the island and cut off supplies, the garrison was eating oysters and periwinkles gathered at low water and fish caught with angling rods. Grey of Wilton thought he could capture the island with 600 men and 10 cannons but was worried that he could not guarantee to support the force on the island once landed if he was attacked elsewhere.Joseph Bain, Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1547-1563, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), p. 365 no. 737. After the peace of the Treaty of Edinburgh in September 1560, the English diplomat noted Thomas Randolph noted that Captain Lucinet and his French garrison remained on Inchkeith, but there were now more women than men, and Edinburgh wits called the island \\"l'Isle des Femmes.\\"Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), pp. 481-2 no. 906. In the 1560s, Mary, Queen of Scots made Robert Anstruther captain of the island.Joseph Bain, Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1547-1563, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), p. 544. She inspected the garrison, and a stone from the original gateway with \\"MR\\" (i.e. Maria Regina) and the date still exists, built into a wall below the lighthouse. The guns were used during the rebellion against Mary called the Chaseabout Raid. Lord Darnley was sent to inspect the armaments in August 1565. The English ship, The Aide captained by Anthony Jenkinson arrived in the Forth on 25 September 1565, and was bombarded by the cannon on Inchkeith. Jenkynson had intended to blockade Leith to prevent Lord Seton bringing more munitions for Mary from France.Calendar of State Papers Scotland, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1900), pp. 197, 220-1: Early voyages and travels to Russia and Persia, by Anthony Jenkinson and other Englishmen (New York, 1967), pp. 167-176 The fort itself was demolished, or ordered to be \\"raisit\\" (razed) in 1567, after Mary had been deposed. Her opponents were anti-French and did not take too kindly to a French garrison so near the capital. The Captain of the garrison, Robert Anstruther, was rewarded with all the ironwork timber and slates to be salvaged, and ownership of the island was given to John Lyon, 8th Lord Glamis.Gordon Donaldson ed., Register of the Privy Seal, vol. 6 (Edinburgh, 1963), p. vi, 20 no. 86, 31 no. 130. The remaining buildings were later used as a prison. James Grant lists subsequent owners of Inchkeith - in 1649, he says, the \\"eccentric and sarcastic\\" Sir John Scott of Scotstarvit, going on to be owned by the Buccleuch family, forming part of the property of the Barony of Royston, near Granton. During the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, the island was again taken by the English, and fortified. =18th century= In the late 18th century, James Boswell's The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides with Samuel Johnson (published in 1785) mentions Inchkeith, upon which Boswell and Dr. Johnson alighted, noting that the now-uninhabited island had a profusion of \\"luxuriant thistles and nettles\\", a \\"strongly built\\" fort, and \\"sixteen head of [grazing] black cattle\\". The fort visited appears to have been built in 1564. Usually the cynic, Johnson admired the island and said, \\"I‚Äôd have this island; I‚Äôd build a house... A rich man of an hospitable turn here, would have many visitors from Edinburgh.\\" =19th century and World War I= Dioptic lens designed by David A Stevenson for the Inchkeith Lighthouse. It was in use from 1889 until automation was introduced in 1985. In 1803, construction was begun of Inchkeith Lighthouse, designed and built by Thomas Smith and Robert Stevenson. The lighthouse, standing 67 metres high, was first operational by 1804, and is now listed as a building of architectural and historic significance. Inchkeith, unlike some of the other islands, was not fortified in the Napoleonic Wars but, with Kinghorn, was the site of the first modern defences, manned from 1881 until 1956. In 1878, the Royal Engineers built batteries on the three corners of the island, designed as separate fortresses. Construction upon the island's \\"South Fort\\" began in spring of 1878, being completed in 1880. Construction on the West and East forts began in summer of 1878, being completed in 1880 and 1881 respectively. These forts were armed with four 10\\" rifled muzzle loader guns, with two in the South Fort and one each in the east and west. In 1891, the East and West guns were replaced with two 6\\" BL (breech loading) disappearing guns. A 9.2\\" Mk I gun, also on a disappearing mounting, was installed in 1893, in the southern part of the island. A controlled minefield was controlled from Inchkeith, and the 'test room' for the Submarine Miners was created in an artificial cave, closed off by a granite wall, on the north side of the island. This was later used as a Small Arms Ammunition store. In 1899, Inchkeith had a Compressed Air Foghorn installed, providing two 3.5 second blasts every 90 seconds during fog. This would remain in place until replaced after the second world war. From the 1890s until the early 1905, the fort at Inchkeith underwent a sequence of gun improvements and replacements. In 1893-95 two 4.7\\" MK1 quick-firing guns were installed. (These had been removed from Fort Paull on the north bank of the Humber (which was disarmed, being deemed to be too close to Hull)). In 1898 the two 10\\" rifled muzzle loaders in the south fort were dismounted, to be replaced by two 6\\" Mk VII guns. The two 4.7\\" guns were replaced by 9.2\\" BL Mk X guns. By 1905 the armament of the island comprised: 1 x 9.2\\" Mk I gun on a disappearing mounting; 2 x 9.2\\" Mk X guns on Central Pedestal mountings; 2 x 6-inch Mk VII guns at the north fort (replacing a single Mk VI 6\\" on a disappearing mounting); 2 x 6\\" Mk VII guns in the southern fort. 1906-7 all the 6\\" guns were removed, leaving only three 9.2\\" guns in place. By 1911 the shore was being covered in Barbed Wire and by the end of the First World War a series of pillboxes had been built on the beaches round the island. By the end of the First World War the island was armed with three 9.2\\" Mk X guns and six 6\\" Mk VII guns. HMS Britannia During World War I, the Royal Navy battleship , at the time a part of the 3rd Battle Squadron in the Grand Fleet, ran aground at Inchkeith on 26 January 1915, suffering considerable bottom damage. She was refloated after 36 hours and was repaired and refitted at Devonport Dockyard.Burt, R. A., British Battleships 1889-1904, Annapolis, Maryland: Naval Institute Press, 1988, , p. 251; Chesneau, Roger, and Eugene M. Kolesnik, eds., Conway's All The World's Fighting Ships, 1860-1905, New York: Mayflower Books, Inc., 1979, , p. 9 View of a snow-covered Fife, with Inchkeith in the foreground, from Portobello. =The Second World War= Between the wars the fort and its guns were maintained. In 1937 several Lewis Guns were supplied, for anti-aircraft defence, and a pair of 12 Pdr QF guns, which were for drill and practice. In 1938, following the Munich Crisis, the island was further mobilised, and had more Nissen Huts installed, presumably for equipment and personnel. On 21 February 1940 a sand-filled dummy shell had to be fired across the bows of the Naval trawler 'Peter Carey', to stop it straying into a mined area; the shell ricocheted off the water and ended up bursting into a tenement flat at 118 Salamander Street in Leith. Fortunately no-one was injured.Finlayson, C 1983 'Just the kitchen sink', University of Edinburgh Journal 31.2, 46-8Fife Free Press, 24 February 1940 Inchkeith was the HQ of the Outer Defences of the Firth of Forth in both wars, in conjunction with batteries at Kinghorn, on the north shore, and Leith on the southern. The defences were designed to protect Edinburgh and the naval anchorage from distant bombardment (the Rosyth Dockyard was out of range), and also to deal with ships attempting to force their way into the naval anchorage beyond the defences, and towards the Forth Rail Bridge and the Rosyth Dockyard). In both wars there were anti-boat and anti-submarine booms across the river at this point, and in the Second World War, there were Induction loops and controlled minefields controlled from Inchkeith. In the Second World War new batteries were established further east at Elie and Dirleton but Inchkeith remained fully armed. In May 1940, the island was issued with 40 \\"Board of Trade, Rocket Flares, Red\\", for alerting in the event that an invasion was attempted (or spotted). The gun strength of the island in the Second World War was the same as at the end of the First World War: one \\"Major Full Time Battery\\" of two 6\\" guns covering the North side of the island, two 6\\" guns covering the South side and the water between the island and Leith, a further two 6\\" guns in the West Fort, and three 9.2\\" guns, the purpose of which to tackle any enemy warships standing off to bombard the naval anchorage or the city of Edinburgh. The island was armed for a time with 3\\" anti- aircraft guns to deal with German aeroplanes dropping magnetic mines. These were replaced by Bren and Bofors guns. The garrison of the island was over 1100 at its peak in the Second World War, with dozens of buildings, emplacements, fire control centres, and Nissen huts, many of which remain in varying states of repair. Operation Fortitude North Operations Fortitude North and Fortitude South were related to a wider deception plan called Operation Bodyguard. Operation Bodyguard was the overall Allied strategic deception plan in Europe for 1944, carried out as part of the build- up to the Invasion of Normandy. The major objective of this plan was to lead the Germans to believe that the invasion of northwestern Europe would come later than was actually planned, and to threaten attacks at other locations than the true objective, including the Pas de Calais, the Balkans, southern France, Norway, and Soviet attacks in Bulgaria and northern Norway. Operation Fortitude North's fictional British Fourth Army were based in Edinburgh, and spoof radio traffic and Double agents were used as means to disseminate the misinformation. On 3 March 1944, members of a \\"Special RS (Royal Signals) Unit\\" from the British Fourth Army landed on Inchkeith, with a detachment of 22 men and 4 officers, with two radio vans. At the beginning of April, a further 40 men arrived, and proceeded to stage mock attacks of the Inchkeith defences via the cliffs, until their departure in September. The aim of this ruse, unknown to the participants, was to make German High Command believe that a raid in Norway or elsewhere was being planned. Although Operation Fortitude was a great success, Inchkeith appears not to have been overflown by German Reconnaissance planes until 7 October. Examination of the footage taken in 1945 appeared to indicate that the plane flew too high to ascertain anything meaningful.UK Fortifications Club - Fort of the Quarter - Inchkeith =Post-war era to present day= Post-war, defences were dismantled commencing late 1945. By early January 1946, only a small number of troops with a \\"nucleus\\" of coastal guns remained, and finally in 1956/7, all military use of the island ceased, and ownership passed over to the Northern Lighthouse Board, who performed a variety of renovations on the island from the early 1960s onwards. The island, like Cramond Island, was previously worked as a farm. It is now abandoned, and unkempt. In 1958, an experimental foghorn was installed, replacing the previous 19th century system. A diaphone system providing 4 blasts of 1.5 seconds once every minute was installed on Inchcolm, operated by radio telephone from Inchkeith. This was replaced with an electrically operated system controlled by an automatic fog detector in 1986. In 1971 the lighthouse and associated buildings became Category B listed buildings, and in 1976 the island and its fortifications became a scheduled monument. In 1986 the lighthouse was automated, allowing it to be remotely managed by a telephone connection. The Northern Lighthouse Board removed the permanent lightkeepers, and sold the island to businessman Tom Farmer (founder of Kwik-Fit). Under Farmer's ownership, permission is needed to land at Inchkeith; he himself lives in Barnton in Edinburgh. The current lighthouse is powered by nickel-cadmium batteries, \\"charged on a time cycle of three times per week by one of two (12.5 KVA) markon alternators with TS3 Lister diesel engines.\\" See also * List of islands of Scotland References Sources  * * External links  Description of the 1555 building work on Inchkeith for Mary of Guise, based on National Records of Scotland E34/21. * Inchkeith Island and fortifications, SM3838, Scheduled Monument, Historic Environment Scotland. * The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides with Samuel Johnson on Project Gutenberg * Northern Lighthouse Board * Victorian Forts data sheet on Yaverland battery Lighthouse links * List of lighthouses in Scotland * List of Northern Lighthouse Board lighthouses Category:Islands of the Forth Category:Lighthouses in Scotland Category:Category B listed lighthouses Category:Rough Wooing Category:Uninhabited islands of Fife ","title":"Inchkeith"},{"id":"2079399","text":"Meninos Cantores da Academia is a Brazilian choir that was founded on July 11, 1953 by the priest Jos√© Maria Wisniewski of the SVD.

As a teenager she worked at a chemical plant. From 1934 to 1937 she studied at the Maxim Gorky Literature Institute. The main themes of her early poetry were the heroism of the Soviet people during industrialization (Year of birth, 1938; Railroad, 1939; Stones and grass, 1940) and during World War II (Lyrics, 1943). Her most famous poem is \\"Zoya\\" (1942), about Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya, a young girl killed by Nazis. This work was one of the most popular poems during the Soviet era. From 1940 to 1950, the poetry of Aliger was characterised by a mix of optimistic semi-official verses (\\"Leninskie mountains\\", 1953), and poems in which Aliger tried to analyse the situation in her country in a realistic way (\\"Your Victory\\", 1944 - 1945). In 1956, in a gathering of Khrushchev with the intelligentsia he admonished the writers for interfering with the political system. It is noted that Aliger was the only writer to speak up against him at the event. It was after his retirement that he apologized to her for his behavior. Aliger wrote numerous essays and articles about Russian literature and her impressions on travelling (\\"On poetry and poets\\", 1980; \\"The return from Chile\\", 1966). Her first husband was the composer Konstantin Makarov-Rakitin, who was killed at the front near Yartsevo in 1941 after the death of their infant son (their daughter Tatyana [1940-1974] became a poet and translator), a double tragedy that left her devastated. The following year she had an affair with the author Alexander Fadeyev; from this union was born a daughter Maria, who married Hans Magnus Enzensberger and lived abroad for twenty years, killing herself shortly after a brief return to Russia in 1991. Aliger's second and final husband was the Central Committee official Igor Chernoutsan (1918-1990). She survived all her husbands and children, dying shortly after her daughter Maria Enzensberger.

It is the sequel to WWE Day of Reckoning. The soundtrack features music by industrial metal group A Dark Halo, who performed two songs in the game including its theme song \\"Burn It All.\\" Day of Reckoning 2 features improved graphics over its predecessor, a new strategy- based submission system, and a storyline that allows the player to choose paths. This game was the last wrestling and/or WWE video game to be released for the GameCube and the first WWE game to feature Stone Cold Steve Austin as a legend along with the PlayStation 2 game, WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006.  Gameplay  Day of Reckoning 2 features similar gameplay to the previous Day of Reckoning game with returning features such as Momentum shift and momentum lift. New to the game is the stamina meter, which slows wrestlers' movement over time and when completely depleted, temporarily leaves characters winded and open to attack. In addition, different levels of bleeding on the player's character also affect the character's ability to regain stamina. The game also introduces four types of submission options. While applying a submission hold, players can choose from one of four submission types: a Taunt submission depletes the opponent's momentum meter, a Rest Hold submission allows the player's character to regain stamina, the Drain submission drains the opponent of stamina, while a regular submission move causes damage to a particular body part. Players can again create wrestlers and customize each character's set of attacks. Each character can be assigned between one and nine finishing moves, one for each position an opponent is in. The game's Story Mode picks up from the story introduced in the first Day of Reckoning, but created wrestlers cannot be imported from the first game. Story The story continues from where the original Day of Reckoning left off, with the player's character at the top of the Raw roster. Almost a year after WrestleMania XX, Evolution has disbanded and the player's character has lost the World Heavyweight Championship back to Triple H and has fallen down the ranks of WWE. However, the player's character has gained a love interest in WWE Diva Stacy Keibler. One month before WrestleMania 21, Triple H loses the title in a controversial match with Chris Jericho and the title is now up for grabs. In an attempt to increase the show's ratings, General Manager Eric Bischoff decides to host a mini-tournament for the World Heavyweight Championship and the finals will be held at WrestleMania 21. The player's character eventually defeats Chris Jericho and advances into the finals. Triple H and the player's character prepare for the finals match before Bischoff reports that the belt was stolen. The player advances in the story by gathering information on the whereabouts of the World Title. Soon the player gets framed for stealing the belt, dumped by Stacy, fired and banned from Raw. However, SmackDown! General Manager Theodore Long signs the player to a lifetime SmackDown! contract. Eventually the player wins the WWE Championship and later finds out that former allies Chris Jericho and Randy Orton along with Edge had stolen the World Heavyweight Championship. With the mystery solved, Triple H asks the player's wrestler for a title match at WrestleMania 21 in a Last Man Standing Match for the WWE Championship. The player's character wins the match, reunites with Stacy and reforges a friendship with Triple H, who turns face and takes possession of the newly found World Heavyweight Championship.

Wartime jetty, fortifications and military buildings on the island. Inchmickery is a small island in the Firth of Forth in Scotland. It is about north of Edinburgh. Its name comes from the Scottish Gaelic, Innis nam Biocaire, meaning Isle of the Vicars, implying that there may have been an old ecclesiastical or Culdee settlement here, as in nearby Inchcolm. It features occasionally in a riddle, \\"How many inches is the Forth?\\", playing on a pun on 'Inch' (Innis), the Gaelic word for island, and inch, the imperial measurement. Inchmickery is tiny, only 100 metres by 200 metres. During both World War I and World War II the island was used as a gun emplacement. The concrete buildings make the island look (from a distance) like a battleship. Although the island is now uninhabited much of this concrete superstructure remains largely intact. The conclusion of Iain Banks's 1993 novel Complicity was set here and the film adaptation used it as a location. The island is now an RSPB reserve, and is home to breeding pairs of common eider, Sandwich terns and various gulls. It used to be a nesting site for the very rare roseate tern, but the roseate terns have now moved elsewhere in the Firth of Forth. There are exposed rocks off Inchmickery, known as the Cow & Calves. Inchmickery was formerly known for its oyster-beds, and used to be covered in moss and lichen.

He followed with a medical degree (MB) from the University of Toronto which he completed in 1927. In 1925, Ham married Dorothy Carlotta Ross. While interning at the Wellesley Hospital, Ham also pursued an active tennis career. In 1928 and 1929, he doubles played for Canada's Davis Cup team, partnering Jack Wright. In '28 he and Wright lost 10-8 in the fifth set to the Japanese duo of Tamimo Abe and Teizo Toba, as Japan prevailed in this America Zone semi-final tie, 3-1. In 1929, Ham and Wright lost to the American team of John F. Hennessey and John Van Ryn, 1-6, 1-6, 6-1, 2-6. Canada lost this tie as well, an America Zone first round encounter, 0-5. Histology In the early 1930s, Ham published his first series of major papers on the formation, maintenance, and destruction of bone within the body. The study of bone would be a theme to which Ham would return throughout his career. The first edition of Ham's seminal histology text-titled simply Histology-was published in 1950. Late career In 1951, Ham was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. Along with Harold E.

He was a delegate for Massachusetts in the Continental Congress. Private life Jonathan Jackson was born in 1743 in Boston, Province of Massachusetts Bay. He was the son of Edward Jackson (1708‚Äì1757) and Dorothy Quincy Jackson. He graduated from Harvard in 1761 and then moved to Newburyport to take up a mercantile career. Jackson first served as an apprentice to another merchant, Patrick Tracy. By 1765 he had entered business on his own as a shipper and importer. He became prosperous and in 1772 he married his mentor's daughter, Hannah Tracy. Shortly after he went into a partnership with his wife's brothers, John and Nathaniel Tracy. The firm of Jackson, Tracy, & Tracy failed during the revolution. So, after 1782, Jonathan took a series of salaried jobs. In 1780 Jackson joined John Hancock and other community leaders in the founding of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Revolutionary years Despite his dependence on foreign trade, Jackson became a supporter of the American Revolution. He converted some of his merchant ships to privateers. In 1775 he was elected to the revolutionary Massachusetts Provincial Congress. He became a member of the state's Committee of Correspondence and headed the Essex County Committee of Safety. Jackson was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1777. He attended the state's Constitutional Convention in 1779. Then in 1782, Massachusetts sent him as one of their delegates to the Continental Congress. But, by this time his financial reverses made him take a job, although he did serve one term in the Massachusetts State Senate in 1789. Later career Eventually Jackson was able to combine his need for employment with his desire for public service. In this period, elected positions generally had no pay. He served as the first U.S. Marshal for the district of Massachusetts (1789‚Äì1791), then as a federal Supervisor of Revenue from 1792 until 1801. Jackson served as Treasurer for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts from 1802 to 1806, and as treasurer of Harvard University. He was president of the Boston Bank, which later became the First National Bank of Boston. When he died in Boston in 1810, he was buried in the Old Granary Burying Ground there. Family Jonathan Jackson and Hannah Tracy had nine children. Their daughter, Hannah, married the manufacturer Francis Cabot Lowell, who went into business with their son, Patrick Tracy Jackson. Their son Charles Jackson went on to serve on the Massachusetts Supreme Court. Their son James Jackson became a physician and co-founded Massachusetts General Hospital, becoming its first physician. Jonathan Jackson's great-grandsons included Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. who served on the U.S. Supreme Court. In the 2004 elections, both George W. Bush and John Kerry published a genealogy in which they claimed Jackson as an ancestor, though neither appear to be actually related.

Geography and geology Craigleith makes up a chain of islands near North Berwick along with Bass Rock, Fidra and the Lamb. Of the four islands it is the closest to the town's harbour. Like the other nearby islands, Craigleith is a bird colony. Divers often explore the area around the island. Craigleith is a laccolith, a lava dome. The Lothians are dotted with evidence of ancient volcanic activity, such as the Bass Rock and Arthur's Seat. Craigleith is made up of essexite which is popular for making curling stones. History and wildlife Craigleith and North Berwick from North Berwick Law Historically, Craigleith was a rabbit warren, where the animals were deliberately bred for food. Rabbits were wiped out by myxomatosis in the 1950s. They were mysteriously re-introduced onto the island in 2008, and some have been seen recently. In 1814, Sir Hew Dalrymple purchased the island from North Berwick Town Council. The puffin colony on Craigleith, once one of the largest in Britain with 28,000 pairs, became endangered from 1999 onwards, due to an invasion of the non-endemic plant tree mallow, thriving with warmer winters, which choked the puffins' burrows, preventing them from rearing their chicks, or \\"pufflings\\". An ongoing project, SOS Puffin, led by the Scottish Seabird Centre at North Berwick, was launched early in 2007 after one of the Centre's volunteers, Maggie Sheddan, noticed the ever-decreasing numbers of puffins. Since then, hundreds of volunteers have been working hard to rid the island of the problem, ferried out by boat from the Seabird Centre during the winter months, when the puffins are out at sea. Initial results show signs that the puffins are starting to return to the island to breed. Cormorants, shags and guillemots breed here. The Scottish Seabird Centre has solar-powered cameras on the islands which transmit images of the puffins and other wildlife on the island via live webcams. Daily boat trips around the island have been made since 2008.

It can be used as an offensive or defensive weapon.  History  A lob is usually hit when an opponent is standing near the net, waiting to volley. The ball should pass over the opponent and into the open court behind. A good offensive lob cannot be reached by the opponent, yet it is low enough and has enough pace and spin so that the opponent can not run back and chase it down. It can win the point outright, although with some risks involved. Topspin greatly enhances the effectiveness of an offensive lob but also makes the stroke more difficult. When executing the lob, players usually hit the ball at an angle between 0 degrees (flat) and 45 degrees (diagonal). Some players, such as Andre Agassi, Michael Chang, Andy Murray and Lleyton Hewitt, have developed good offensive lobs. A defensive lob requires the opponent to retreat to the baseline and prolongs the point. When a player is out of court, playing a defensive lob can buy time to run back and adopt a better defensive position. An unsuccessful lob is susceptible to being smashed. In doubles, spin or slice is applied to the lob, so it will go over the head of a player at the net and bounce away from the baseline player. Some players are able to manipulate a lob so that it appears the shot is overhit, but dips enough to fall within the baseline, often deceiving the opponent. This is created by generating a great amount of backspin, slicing or cutting the ball over the head of the other player. This shot, which can also be hit with tremendous topspin, is called a \\"moon volley or moon lob. The lob was introduced by Frank Hadow, the second Wimbledon champion, in his defeat of Spencer Gore. * Grass courts dominated the early Grand Slams, with three of the four major tournaments featuring the soft surface of the natural ground. Because of this, the ball could always touch the grass on the field, and later on, in a match, such coverings became torn resulting in poor bounces.(Groppel, 1980) This made the majority of players to prefer to serve as well as volley to avoid bad bounces. Initially, there were two significant styles of playing tennis. *There was Australia's style, as well as, American style. The Aussies were proponents of the \\"one grip fits all\\" philosophy, and stripped tennis down to its bare basics. The rule insisted that if one had to use \\"one grip for all,\\" it needed to be the continental grip. In addition to that continental grip, their primary tactic was to serve and volley, but they also applied the backhands. Their weakest area was the forehand. *The second evolution was the reverse forehand lob. This lob became associated with the tennis player Pete Sampras. Sampras, even today, remains cemented among the legendary for his huge serve. The reverse forehand lob was a newly designed passing shot, for this the forehand became a stable of the current passing shot. This shot was to be either a short hit, a sharp crosscut, or maybe hit deep up the line. *Most of the tennis court offers a lot of space near the baseline, and this has led the majority of players to stand at the baseline and attempt the standing back lob. This maneuver was mostly for the defensive players, as they used it to strike the ball faster, as well as, at sharp angles, mainly during the 1970s. *The windshield-wiper forehead can also provide a lob shot in tennis. During the old days, the forehand was often accompanied by a high follow-through. Used by players such as Pete Sampras, it reached its novelty in the 1990s but became the staple in the 2000s. The next type of lob that appeared on the tennis scene was called the \\"squash shot forehand,\\" it was a defensive lob, and it was great during its day.Brown, M. (1991). Tennis rules and techniques in pictures. Perigee Trade. Today this shot offers a solution to the sole forehand. In the old days, the \\"Recovery slice backhand\\" lob was used to approach the net. In addition to that, it was more offensive shot. Today it is used to recover. *\\"The swinging volley,\\" was an innovation of Lendl‚Äôs. It employed strong topspin forehands and even more of the volley. It is also used today by players such as Roger Federer but was more common in the 1980s. Big servers used it the most. Some servers including Federer even still use today. *The \\"Kick serve\\" lob has been in use for the relatively extended period.(Roetert and Groppel, 2001) Though it has little fame, it is still used to have the ball \\"kick\\" over the opponents head during serving.

Background LGBT rights and culture in the Republic of Singapore are a controversial topic, due to the country's history of homophobia. Over the years, Singapore has taken steps to open up to gender equality, however the issue of LGBT rights and culture in Singapore is a taboo subject for the Singaporean media. List =Crunch Time= It was only in May 2003 that the very first locally produced television documentary dealing with homosexuality as its main subject was broadcast on Singaporean airwaves. It was a homophobic, 30-minute episode in a Mandarin-language series called Crunch Time 2 shown on Channel U, a television station owned by Singapore Press Holdings. The series was advertised in The Straits Times which promoted it as one that featured the turning points in the lives of 12 people including a loan shark, an unwed mother and a drug addict. The particular program featured actors re-enacting the supposedly true-life account of a young, masculine gay Singaporean man cruising for sex in public swimming pools and toilets. It reinforced the misconception that homosexuality resulted from having an unhappy home, parents who constantly fight, and being sexually abused. In this case, the protagonist was only 6 years old when he was asked by an adult female to perform sexual acts with a girl his age. The episode wound up with an interview with a spokesman from Choices, a Christian counselling group from the Church of our Saviour (COOS) in Queenstown which helps \\"straighten\\" out gay lives, which was the eventual outcome for the gay man in the story. He was depicted as having been \\"successfully'\\" converted through counselling from a dissatisfied, unfulfilled homosexual to a man happily married to a female spouse and producing a son. The negative and stereotypical depiction of homosexuality in the program prompted an online petition which garnered more than 200 signatories over the ensuing weekend. It probably had a significant effect as the episode was the last time a homophobic documentary was aired in Singapore. However, the overwhelmingly influential factor in ending televised homophobia was Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong's statements in Time magazine in July 2003 about reversing anti-gay hiring policies in the Civil Service. *Read a video storyboard of the documentary: *View a compressed video of the original broadcast: =OK, No Problem= In a 180-degree turnaround just 2 months after the above documentary, which aimed to encourage homosexuals to turn straight, Channel U aired a groundbreaking episode in the info-tainment hands-on series OK, No Problem at 7:30 p.m. on 30 July 2003. This time, it sought instead to educate the public that one could not judge a man's sexual orientation merely from his external appearance and to foster understanding and acceptance of homosexuals. Popular comp√®re Chuan Yi Fong was filmed in a hawker centre in Ang Mo Kio where she asked random diners about their opinions on homosexuality. A range of positive and negative views were offered. A live telephone interview with Dr. Tan Chong Kee, who was introduced as having written a thesis on homosexuality in Taiwan, was interpolated during a voting session by onlookers. The latter were asked to pick which, amongst 3 chosen men, they thought were gay, judging from externalities. After the votes were cast, it was revealed to the audience's surprise that none of the three were gay. In fact, one had brought along his wife and baby son. The highlight of the episode was the appearance of an actual gay man named Anthony who was initially hidden behind a black curtain. After a suspenseful emergence to face a wall of curious onlookers, he spoke emotionally about his own struggles as a homosexual and how he hoped society would accept them. He also publicly thanked Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong for his recent announcement that openly homosexual individuals would now be employed in the Civil Service. Anthony choked back his tears as he spoke, causing the comp√®re's eyes to also redden, and members of the audience to listen sympathetically. For his courage, Anthony was presented with a bouquet of flowers and received a huge round of applause. * Watch a compressed video of the original broadcast: , and the drama segment preceding it, which dealt with a gay man who experienced discrimination in applying for a job: =Detik= Later, on the same night of 30 July 2003 at 8:30 p.m., the Malay-language channel Suria aired another documentary on homosexuality in its Detik (meaning \\"a second in time\\") series. The particular episode was entitled \\"Haruskah golongan Homoseksual diterima?\\" (Should Homosexuals be accepted?) It featured interviews with a Malay gay man named Helmi and a Malay lesbian named Zac in which they recounted their self- discovery and personal relationships. People on the street were asked whether they could accept homosexuals and a diverse range of negative to positive opinions were expressed. It revealed to the Malay community, the presence of websites providing support for Muslim homosexuals. Figures of authority queried for their views included Dr. Francis Ngui (President, Singapore Psychiatric Association) and Ustaz Fatris Bakaram (Assistant Mufti and Head of the Mufti Office, Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura, MUIS or Singapore Islamic Religious Council). All in all, the programme tried its best to present a balanced view of homosexuality without moralising or injecting any subliminal message. *Read a Malay transcript of the programme with selected video still- frames: *Watch a compressed video of the original broadcast: =Inside Out= On 23 February 2005, Mandarin-language Channel U broadcast its third programme dealing with homosexuality in the 'Inside Out' current affairs series. The topic of the episode was \\"Do homosexuals have space for their activities?\\" This programme was a landmark in that it was the first time that the views of leading gay activists, in this case Eileena Lee and Charles Tan from People Like Us 3 (PLU3), were given a relatively lengthy airing on primetime television. Artistic Co-Director Nelson Chia from Toy Factory Theatre Ensemble, a drama company which had staged several plays with homosexual themes and assisted in producing the episode itself, also presented a pro-gay voice for theatre in particular and society in general. Chia expressed, with great conviction, his disquietude with the contradictions between Singapore's liberalisation drive and the recent curbing of public gay spaces, despite the fact that he himself was a heterosexual family man. An anonymous gay man named \\"David\\" was also interviewed at length, in which he doubted Singaporeans' general level of acceptance of homosexuals. The programme was thought to have been produced to give an opportunity for the gay community to vent its concerns after an official clampdown on gay parties like Nation.04 and Snowball in 2004, presumably as part of a conservative backlash against the rampant spread of HIV infection within the community. In spite of NUS sociologist Associate Professor Paulin Tay Straughan's assertion in the documentary that homosexuals in Singapore enjoyed almost everything their straight counterparts were entitled to, gay community leaders like Alex Au begged to differ. *Watch a compressed video of the original broadcast: *Read Yawning Bread's analysis of the documentary: External links * International documentaries dealing with homosexuality shown on Singapore cable television: Category:LGBT culture in Singapore *Singapore Category:Lists of documentaries ","title":"List of Singaporean LGBT documentaries"},{"id":"2079448","text":"VG-62VG-62 Official Homepage is a sports club based in Naantali, Finland.

His musical style was influenced by Franz Liszt, and as a conductor he was a strong advocate of new music. Biography Born in Greiz, he commenced piano study in 1868. His family moved to Berlin in 1874 where he began studying with Theodor Kullak. He entered university there in 1878, privately studying composition with Friedrich Kiel. Bernhard Stavenhagen In 1885 Stavenhagen became a pupil of Franz Liszt in Weimar, travelling with him to Rome, Budapest, Paris, London and Bayreuth. After Liszt's death in 1886, Stavenhagen embarked on a ten-year series of piano concert tours in Europe and to North America. In April 1890 he was appointed court pianist to the Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar and the following July he married Agnes Denninghof (better known as Agnes Denis-Stavenhagen, 1860-1945), a soprano with the Weimar Court Opera. In 1893 he composed his Third Piano Concerto in B minor. He fulfilled conducting appointments in Weimar, where he was appointed court Kapellmeister and conducted Weimar premieres of six new operas in eighteen months, and from 1898 a similar appointment in Munich. Then in 1907 he moved to Geneva, taking over the piano master classes at the Conservatoire there until his death in 1914. In subscription concerts he conducted premieres of works by composers ranging from Richard Strauss, Hans Pfitzner and Gustav Mahler to Arnold Schoenberg, Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel. After his death his body was transferred to Weimar where he was buried. Among his piano roll recordings is a performance of Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsody No. 12; he annotated this recording to suggest that it was how he had heard Liszt play it. He is commemorated by the music school Bernhard Stavenhagen in Greiz.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 15, 1998. In an extended parody of Lord of the Flies, Bart, Lisa, and other students from Springfield Elementary School are stranded on an island and are forced to work together. Meanwhile, Homer founds his own Internet company. It was written by David X. Cohen and directed by Pete Michels. Guest star James Earl Jones narrates the final scene of the episode. Plot The Springfield Elementary School Model United Nations club is going on a field trip. On the bus, Bart, Nelson, Ralph, and Milhouse play a game by racing fruit down the aisle. Milhouse rolls a grapefruit that gets stuck under the brakes. When Otto tries to press down on the pedal, it squirts juice into his eyes, causing him to lose control and drive the bus off a bridge. Otto tries to swim for help, but gets swept away by the current and picked up by Chinese fishermen. Otto is excited, thinking they will help him rescue the kids, but they actually plan to use him for slave labor below deck. The students swim to a nearby tropical island, where Bart tries to tell everyone that being stranded is fun and imagines a lavish lifestyle there. Reality sets in when the island is found to be largely barren and the kids lack survival skills. With no food or adult supervision, the kids rely on snack food retrieved from the sunken bus by Bart, while Lisa sets up a ration system. They awake the next morning to find the snacks all gone. Suspecting Milhouse, he blames the loss on a mysterious island \\"monster\\", which does not hold water with most of the kids. As they prepare to lynch him, Lisa reminds them of why they traveled in the first place - the Model UN - and Milhouse is allowed a trial, with Bart as a judge. As there is insufficient evidence to prove Milhouse ate all the food, Bart acquits him. Lisa proclaims the law has spoken, but it soon turns to outright mob rule as the other kids fail to accept the verdict and attempt to lynch Milhouse, as well as Bart and Lisa. They chase them into a cave, where all the kids are scared off by a monster for real. Martin then sees the \\"monster\\" is actually a wild boar. On one of the boar's tusks is an empty bag of chips, revealing that the boar was the culprit who ate all the snacks. Lisa says that if there is a live animal, there must be a food source somewhere, and recommends the slime it licks. The other kids instead kill the boar and eat it, while Lisa adheres to her strict vegetarianism by licking the rocks (all the while insulting the others by calling them \\"savages\\" but also struggling with her disgust of the slime). A deus ex machina narration by James Earl Jones says the kids learned to live in peace and were somehow rescued by Moe Szyslak. Back at home, Homer discovers that Ned Flanders has his own home- based Internet business and decides he wants to start his own company. However, Homer has not the foggiest idea of how an Internet business works nor what to peddle (he doesn't even own a computer). He is later visited by Bill Gates and his goons, who offer to buy him out. Homer then learns that Gates' definition of \\"buy out\\" is to smash up Homer's office, with the snarky response \\"I did not get rich by writing a lot of checks\\". Production According to the DVD commentary for The Simpsons' ninth season, the couch gag was suggested by Dan Castellaneta's niece. To make the fishermen's speech as accurate as possible, Cohen called a friend who spoke Mandarin. When the Chinese actors came, the actors did not feel Mandarin was geographically appropriate, and was changed to Cantonese, which is spoken more in China's coastal regions and would be more appropriate for sailors and fishermen. In a deleted scene, Homer furnishes his home office with anti-stress toys, but becomes angry and stressful himself when he tries each of them due to their failure to work or their immediate breakage due to shoddy manufacturing. The producers said the decision to cut that scene was for timing purposes. Cultural references *Most of the episode's plot, namely a group of children trapped on an island and the breakdown of law, order and civility, is a reference to William Golding's 1954 novel Lord of the Flies, including the use of deus ex machina as a plot device that saves the children. A main diversion was while the episode showed the kids learning to live in peace, the novel had the boys' \\"war\\" broken up when they are rescued by a Navy ship, which, ironically, was in the middle of a war itself. *The title comes from the 1981 film Das Boot, although it would be \\"\\" in German. *When the children are squabbling in the classroom, Principal Skinner restores order by banging his shoe on the desk. Skinner's actions are a reference to the shoe-banging incident by Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev at the UN in 1960. *The bus plunge off the overpass was inspired by the climax of the 1994 film True Lies, although some animators remarked a similar scene happened in the 1989 James Bond film License to Kill, where a corrupt cop helps to free the Bond villain from custody. *When the kids are on a manhunt of Lisa, Bart and Milhouse, they use charcoal ash on their faces like war paint, and Ralph Wiggum paints his in a cat style akin to Peter Criss of KISS. *When escaping from the other children, Bart, Lisa and Milhouse have to swing across a gap on a vine; Milhouse goes across first, but refuses to throw the vine back in a reference to the opening scene of the 1981 film Raiders of the Lost Ark, where Satipo does the same to Indiana Jones. Reception In its original broadcast, \\"Das Bus\\" finished 17th in ratings for the week of February 9‚Äì15, 1998, with a Nielsen rating of 9.9, equivalent to approximately 9.6 million viewing households. It was the third highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following The X-Files and King of the Hill. In a 2006 article in USA Today, \\"Das Bus\\" was highlighted among the six best episodes of The Simpsons season 9, along with \\"Trash of the Titans\\", \\"The Last Temptation of Krust\\", \\"The Cartridge Family\\", \\"Dumbbell Indemnity\\", and \\"The Joy of Sect\\". The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it a \\"fantastic episode\\", adding: \\"Ignore the Internet business side, and wallow in the cleverness of the children trapped on the island. Bart has never been cleverer, Nelson more menacing, and Milhouse more geekish. Great stuff with a delightful ending that is so witty and obvious, that it's annoying you never imagined they'd get away with it.\\" The episode has become study material for sociology courses at University of California, Berkeley, where it is used to \\"examine issues of the production and reception of cultural objects, in this case, a satirical cartoon show\\", and to figure out what it is \\"trying to tell audiences about aspects primarily of American society, and, to a lesser extent, about other societies\\". Some questions asked in the courses include: \\"What aspects of American society are being addressed in the episode? What aspects of them are used to make the points? How is the satire conveyed: through language? Drawing? Music? Is the behavior of each character consistent with his/her character as developed over the years? Can we identify elements of the historical/political context that the writers are satirizing? What is the difference between satire and parody?\\" References External links *\\"Das Bus\\" at The Simpsons.com  Category:The Simpsons (season 9) episodes Category:1998 American television episodes Category:Castaways in fiction Category:Cultural depictions of Bill Gates Category:Television episodes written by David X.

The walkway is lined with large rain trees. The most prominent entrance to the park is the one on the east side, intended only for pedestrians. A bust of Meenatai Thackeray, late wife of Shiv Sena leader Bal Thackeray, has been placed at this entrance. Previously a bust of Ram Ganesh Gadkari was present at the same spot. Bal Thackeray himself was cremated here. History Political rally at Shivaji Park, 3 May 2008 The park was established in 1925 by the Bombay Municipal Corporation, during British Rule. It was known as the Mahim Park until 1927, when it was renamed after the 17th century king of the region, Shivaji, at the behest of a municipal councilor, Avantika Gohkale. The Shivaji Park Gymkhana, then known as the Dadar Hindu Gymkhana, opened its first Tennis court on the grounds in 1927 and inaugurated its pavilion in November 1931. Besides being a venue for gatherings of freedom fighters in British India, after independence in 1947, Shivaji Park was the focal point of the Samyukta Maharashtra Chalval (the struggle for a consolidated Maharashtra) that led to the present Indian state of Maharashtra being formed in 1960. During this period, the legendary writer, journalist, playwright, poet and social leader Acharya Prahlad Keshav Atre led this movement, addressing crowds of hundreds of thousands at this ground, earning him the title of the 'Lord of Shivaji Park'. Shivaji Park has been integral to the political gatherings of the local political party Shiv Sena, and has witnessed numerous other political rallies. In May 2010, the Bombay High Court declared the ground a silence zone after local residents filed a public interest litigation suit in September 2009, complaining about the noise pollution in the area on account of political rallies and gatherings. Statue Shivaji statue at Shivaji Park The statue of Shivaji, found on the western side of the park is one of the very few statues in which he is depicted without having drawn out his sword. Instead, Shivaji is shown simply leading the way with his arm outstretched. Sculpted in 1966 using donations from the local population, the statue is a rare example of the pacifist policies of the then state government of Maharashtra. It was considered a sensitive issue by the government to let this statue not depict the usual confrontational posture of Shivaji, who had fought many battles against the Mughal Empire. Cricket Shivaji Park Ground Shivaji Park is renowned as the cradle of Indian cricket. It is home to eight cricket clubs, such as those of Anna Vaidya and Ramakant Acharekar, which produced several international cricket players for India. Some famous players who have trained here are Sachin Tendulkar, Sunil Gavaskar, Ajit Wadekar, Vijay Manjrekar, Eknath Solkar, Dilip Vengsarkar, Chandrakant Pandit, Lalchand Rajput, Sandeep Patil, Ajit Agarkar, Pravin Amre, Vinod Kambli and Sanjay Manjrekar. It is a feeder park to Ramnarain Ruia College and Poddar College in nearby Matunga. Surroundings Shivaji Park Residential Zone with Shivaji Park ground and the Arabian Sea in the background The area surrounding the park has many buildings dating back to the mid-1900s, and the Shivaji Park Residential Zone is some of the more sought-after real estate in Mumbai.

Hennessy (1858 ‚Äì October 16, 1890) was a police chief of New Orleans, Louisiana. As a young detective, he made headlines in 1881 when he captured a notorious Italian criminal, Giuseppe Esposito. In 1888, he was promoted to superintendent and chief of police. While in office he made a number of improvements to the force, and was well known and respected in the New Orleans community. His assassination in 1890 led to a sensational trial. A series of acquittals and mistrials angered locals, and an enormous mob formed outside the prison the next day. The prison doors were forced open and 11 of the 19 Italian men who had been indicted for Hennessy's murder were lynched. The March 14, 1891 lynchings were the largest known mass lynching in U.S. history. Early life David C. Hennessy was born into an Irish Catholic family, son of Margaret and David Hennessy Sr., at 275 Girod St., New Orleans. David Sr. was a member of the First Louisiana Cavalry of the Union Army during the U.S. Civil War, formed after the state was occupied by Union troops. After the war, during the Reconstruction era, he served with the Metropolitan Police, a New Orleans force under the authority of the governor of Louisiana. Local white democrats generally considered the Metropolitan Police as a form of occupation army, because it protected the right of freedmen to vote, in accordance with the Fifteenth Amendment. David Sr. was murdered in 1869 by Arthur Guerin, a fellow policeman. Career Hennessy joined the New Orleans police force as a messenger in 1870. While only a teenager, he caught two adult thieves in the act, beat them with his bare hands, and dragged them to the police station. He made detective at the age of 20. With his cousin Michael Hennessy and private detectives James Mooney and John Boland of New York City, he arrested the notorious Italian bandit and fugitive Giuseppe Esposito in 1881. Esposito was wanted in Italy for kidnapping a British tourist and cutting off his ear, among numerous other crimes. Esposito was deported to Italy, where he was given a life sentence. In 1882, Hennessy was tried for the murder of New Orleans Chief of Detectives Thomas Devereaux. At the time, both men were candidates for the position of chief. Hennessy argued self-defense and was found not guilty. Hennessy left the department afterwards and joined a private security firm given police powers by the city. He handled security for the New Orleans World Fair of 1884‚Äì1885. The New York Times noted that Hennessy's men were, \\"neatly uniformed and are a fine-looking and intelligent body of men, far superior to the regular city force.\\" In 1888, Joseph A. Shakspeare, the nominee of the Young Men's Democratic Association, was elected mayor of New Orleans with Republican support. Having promised to end police inefficiency, Shakspeare promptly appointed Hennessy as his police chief. Hennessy inherited a police force that was (according to the local press) incompetent and plagued by corruption. Under his supervision, it began to show signs of improvement. Assassination Hennessy memorial tomb On the evening of October 15, 1890, Hennessy was shot by several gunmen as he walked home from work. It is likely that the gunmen were wielding sawn off shotguns - known in Italian terms as lupara - a common type of execution among Mafiosi. Hennessy returned fire and chased his attackers before collapsing. When asked who had shot him, Hennessy reportedly whispered to Captain William O'Connor: \\"Dagos.\\" Hennessy was awake in the hospital for several hours after the shooting and spoke to friends but did not name the shooters. The next day, complications set in and he died. There had been an ongoing feud between the Provenzano and Mantranga families, who were business rivals on the New Orleans waterfront. Hennessy had put several of the Provenzanos in prison, and their appeal trial was coming up. According to some reports, Hennessy had been planning to offer new evidence at the trial to clear the Provenzanos and implicate the Mantrangas. That would mean that the Mantrangas, not the Provenzanos, had a motive for the murder. A policeman, a friend of Hennessy, later testified that Hennessy had told him he had no such plans. In any case, it was widely believed that Hennessy's killers were Italian. Local papers such as the Times-Democrat and the Daily Picayune freely blamed \\"Dagoes\\" for the murder. Various newspaper accounts of the era linked Hennessy's murder to Esposito and the Mafia. Aftermath Hennessy had been popular in New Orleans, and the pressure to catch his killers was intense. The police responded by arresting dozens of local Italians. Eventually 19 men were indicted for the murder and held without bail in the Parish Prison. The following March, nine of the accused men were tried. A series of acquittals and mistrials angered locals, and an enormous mob formed outside the prison the next day. The prison doors were forced open and 11 of the men were lynched. The incident strained U.S.-Italian relations for a time, but was eventually settled with a cash indemnity. Press coverage of the assassination and lynching was sensational and anti-Italian in tone, and generally would not meet modern journalistic standards. It was almost universally assumed that the lynched men were Mafia assassins who had deserved their fate. Since then, many historians have questioned this assumption. The lynchings were the subject of the 1999 HBO movie Vendetta, starring Christopher Walken. The movie is based on a 1977 book by Richard Gambino. On November 24, 1893, John Williams, an African-American, was sentenced to life in prison for the rape of the 10-year-old, Rafael D'Amico. Williams was one of the state witnesses in the Hennessy murder trial. Joseph Shakspeare had ordered the sentence. Hennessy is buried in Metairie Cemetery, New Orleans. Louisiana songwriter Fred Bessel published a bestselling song about Hennessy in 1891, titled \\"The Hennessy Murder.\\" It begins: :Kind friends if you will list to me a sad story I'll relate, :'Tis of the brave Chief Hennessy and how he met his fate :On that quiet Autumn Evening when all nature seemed at rest, :This good man was shot to death; may his soul rest with the blest.

F. (November 1862) \\"Of the early Frisian Settlements in Scotland\\". Antiquaries of Scotland. 4 Part 1.) is an uninhabited island in the Firth of Forth, north-west of North Berwick, on the east coast of Scotland. The island is an RSPB Scotland nature reserve. Geography Fidra Island viewed from Yellowcraig beach Like the other islands near North Berwick, Fidra is the result of volcanic activity around 335 million years ago. Fidra consists of three sections; a hill at one end with the lighthouse on it; a low-lying section in the middle, effectively an isthmus; and a rocky stack at the other end. History View of Fidra from Yellowcraig The island's name is believed to be Old Norse in origin, referring to the large number of bird feathers found there. Like the nearby Bass Rock, it has a substantial seabird population, and is now an RSPB reserve. The village of Gullane lies to the south-west, and the nature reserve of Yellowcraig and village of Dirleton, to which parish Fidra belongs,Martine, John (1890) Fourteen Parishes of the County of Haddington, Edinburgh, p.50-51 are to the south. Remotely operated cameras on the island send live pictures to the watching visitors at the Scottish Seabird Centre in North Berwick.Fidra Web Cam Scottish Seabird Centre. Retrieved on 18 June 2008. Upon the island are ruins of an old chapel, or lazaretto for the sick, which was dedicated in 1165 to St Nicholas. In the 12th-century, the island formed part of the barony of Dirleton, which was granted to the Anglo-Norman John de Vaux by King David I. The de Vaux family built a stronghold, known as Castle Tarbet, on the island, but in 1220, William de Vaux gifted Fidra to the monks of Dryburgh Abbey, in the Borders. His successor built Dirleton Castle, on the mainland, as a replacement dwelling.Tabraham, Chris (2007) Dirleton Castle 2nd edition. Historic Scotland. pp.21-22 Nature and ecology The number of breeding puffins on the island has increased recently due to the removal of an introduced plant, tree mallow (Lavatera arborea). It is likely that it was planted by lighthouse keepers for use as toilet paper, and for its medicinal qualities. The shrub was blocking the entrances to the breeding burrows, and in 1996 the number of occupied burrows had fallen to approximately 400. Following clearance by RSPB Scotland staff and volunteers over 1,000 burrows are occupied in 2016. Cultural references Robert Louis Stevenson often visited the beaches at the area known today as Yellowcraig and it is said that he based his map of Treasure Island on the shape of Fidra. (This claim is also made about the island of Unst in Shetland.) He also mentioned Fidra in his novel Catriona. Fidra Books is a publishing house, named after the island, and which uses Fidra's outline as part of its logo. The progressive rock band Marillion also briefly mention Fidra in the song, Warm Wet Circles, which contains the line \\"She nervously undressed in the dancing beams of the Fidra Lighthouse\\", the coast nearby apparently being a well-known courting spot. Lighthouse The lighthouse, which was built in 1885 and automated in 1970, is accessible via a jetty on the east coast of the island.

On display at Gangaramaya Temple museum. Yab-yum (Tibetan literally, \\"father-mother\\") is a common symbol in the Buddhist art of India, Bhutan, Nepal, and Tibet. It represents the primordial union of wisdom and compassion, depicted as a male deity in union with his female consort through the similar idea of interpenetration or \\"coalescence\\" (Wylie: zung-'jug; Sanskrit: yuganaddha), using the concept of Indra's net to illustrate this.Neville, Robert C. (1987).New metaphysics for eternal experience, Journal of Chinese Philosophy 14, 357-370. The male figure represents compassion and skillful means, while the female partner represents insight. In yab-yum the female is seated on the male‚Äôs lap. There is a rare presentation of a similar figure but reversed, with the male sitting on the female‚Äôs lap, called yum-yab. Origins The symbolism is associated with Anuttarayoga tantra and, while there are various interpretations of the symbolism in twilight language, the male figure is usually linked to compassion (') and skillful means (upƒÅya-kau≈õalya), while the female partner is linked to \\"wisdom\\" (praj√±ƒÅ).Keown, Damien. (2003). A Dictionary of Buddhism, p. 338. Oxford University Press. . Iconography Yab-yum is generally understood to represent the primordial (or mystical) union of wisdom and compassion.The Marriage of Wisdom and Method By Marco Pallis In Buddhism the masculine form is active, representing the compassion and skillful means (upayaupaya Encyclop√¶dia Britannica) that have to be developed in order to reach enlightenment. The feminine form is passive and represents wisdom (prajna), which is also necessary to enlightenment. United, the figures symbolize the union necessary to overcome the veils of Maya, the false duality of object and subject. These figures are frequently worked in the shape of statuesParamasukha-Chakrasamvara and Vajravarahi or reliefs, or are painted on thangkas. Yab-yum may also be represented through the aniconic signification of yantra and mandala. =Tibetan Buddhism= In Tibetan Buddhism, the same ideas are to be found concerning the bell and the dorje, which, like the yab- yum, symbolize the dualism that must be transcended. The sacred Tantric practice leads to rapid development of mind by using the experience of bliss, non-duality, and ecstasy while in communion with one's consort, either visualized, or in the case of advanced practitioners, in some cases physical. In one important Anuttarayoga text, where Tilopa expounds the meaning to Naropa, it is said: Indicating the advanced nature of the actual practice with consort, the verses are the last in what is already widely considered as a text for the most advanced practitioners, a fact clearly evident in the story about Naropa's receiving the teaching. =Hinduism= In Hinduism the yab-yum has a slightly different meaning. There, the embraced posture represents the divine strength of creation. The Hindu concept is of a passive masculine deity embracing his spouse, called shakti, which represents his activity or power. The yab-yum of Chakrasamvara-Vajravarahi is directly influenced from the Hinduist depiction of Kali and Bhairava in union. Sadhana The symbolism of union and sexual polarity is a central teaching in Tantric Buddhism, especially in Tibet. The union is realised by the practitioner as a mystical experience within one's own body.Herrmann-Pfandt, Adelheid. \\"Yab Yum Iconography and the Role of Women in Tibetan Tantric Buddhism.\\" The Tibet Journal. Vol. XXII, No. 1. Spring 1997, pp. 12-34. As a tantric practice, Yab- yum is akin to the KarmamudrƒÅ or \\"actionseal\\". This is the tantric yoga involving a physical partner. However, the aim of the practice is to control one's winds. This sadhana is part of the completion stage. Gallery File:Heruka in Yab-Yum form (1544 AD).jpgHeruka with prajna Vajravarahi (1544 AD).

It was founded in 1897 as a fee paying school for girls. Notre Dame High was the last remaining single sex council school in Scotland until November 2019. History In 1894 Archbishop Eyre of Glasgow invited the Sisters of Notre Dame to come from the Mother House in Liverpool to establish a community in Glasgow. The Notre Dame Training College was opened in 1895 at Dowanhill. In 1897 Notre Dame School was opened as a private school, with a roll of 24 pupils, instructed by two teachers. By 1912, the number of pupils had risen to 193. Overcrowding led to proposals for a new building. This was designed by Thomas Cordiner in 1939, but due to the outbreak of war construction was delayed, and the building opened in 1953. In 1987, the school was protected as a category A listed building. At the same time as proposals to close the school were defeated.History of Notre Dame School The former high school building and adjoining primary school building and church were damaged in a fire on 12 June 2010.BBC News - Fire Damages Former Notre Dame School The single-sex entry criteria has been a controversial issue. Local parents campaigned for the school to become co-educational in the 1990s but the bid failed at Council committee level. In 2016, a new campaign group of local school parents (NDH4ALL) was established to ask Glasgow City Council to reconsider the single sex entry criteria and allow access to both girls and boys in the local catchment area. A public consultation on Notre Dame High's entry criteria was launched in March 2019 and ran for a period of 10 weeks. The consultation received a high level of publicity and engagement, with almost 5000 responses counted. Glasgow City Council also conducted three high profile public meetings during the consultation period. The meetings saw attendance in the hundreds with many pupils speaking of their experiences. Consultation results were released in August 2019 revealing that, of the three options proposed, co-education received the highest number of responses (45.7%). In November 2019 a consultation response report was published by Glasgow City Council Education Services in conjunction with Education Scotland. The report recommended that Notre Dame High become co-educational. A final vote on the recommendation by the Glasgow City Council City Administration Committee took place on 28 November 2019, with the committee unanimously voting to make the school co-educational.

Gameplay WWE WrestleMania 21 includes superstars from WWE Raw 2 and new wrestlers, including: Charlie Haas, Jackie Gayda, Lance Cade, Ren√© Dupr√©e, Shelton Benjamin, and Eugene. The game features a new reversal system dubbed the Pro Reversal System. This feature allows for simpler functionality with reversing an opponent's move. Development and release WrestleMania 21 was first announced by THQ just before E3 2004, stating that the game would be replacing the Raw video game series. Microsoft accidentally sent an older broken version of the game to the disc manufacturer resulting in gamers being unable to connect to the Xbox Live service upon release until a downloadable patch was made available soon thereafter. Reception Despite an upgrade in visuals, and a fully voiced career-mode, the game was met with very mixed reception due to its gameplay. Rather than being an upgrade of a pre-existing game engine, it was virtually built from the ground up, as well as containing numerous glitches that crippled the gameplay experience. In their review of the game, GameSpot mentioned that the hit detection was horrible. Among various other problems such as a slow and unresponsive AI taking away from the difficulty, or drastically decreasing the length of a match. A Create-a- Wrestler mode lacking a variety of moves, and items for the wrestler being created. While specialty matches are included within the game, they are only playable in 1 on 1. Among other problems, VideoGamer.com mentioned that the game had sloppy controls.

Badminton A good drop shot will go just over the net, landing close to the net. If the shot is played fast enough, it will supposedly not allow the opponent to hit it back. They also should be able to, if the opponent hits it, it will give you the mid and back-court space to exploit. Tennis A good drop shot requires great touch. The ball should bounce low and near the net, sometimes with underspin (or backspin). Backspin slows the ball and decreases the height of its bounce. In some extreme cases, the ball will bounce back towards the net. Sidespin may also be put on the ball so it kicks sideways when it bounces. A bad drop shot is one that travels too deep into the court, or bounces too high. When this happens, the opponent can get to the ball, and make an easy play. A very soft drop shot, that just barely travels over the net, is sometimes called a dink (a term possibly borrowed from volleyball). Making the drop shot a surprise also makes it more effective. If opponents are expecting a normal shot, they may not be in position to run forward to make a good play on a drop shot. The characteristics of some court surfaces make drop shots particularly effective; grass and clay are good examples. On grass, the ball tends to bounce lower than other courts, which makes it harder to retrieve a drop shot. On clay, the slow surface tends to encourage players to stay far back and engage in rallies from behind the baseline, which in turn increases the distance the player must cover to reach a drop shot near the net. Drop shots on hard courts can be useful, although to a lesser degree. Drop shots are also useful when the wind is blowing in the opposite direction of the shot; this allows spin without hitting the shot too long. A drop shot hit with a volley is aptly coined a drop volley. The secret to making a good drop volley is having \\"soft hands.\\" To achieve this, a player slightly loosens his or her grip on the racquet at the moment of impact with the ball. This allows the racquet to absorb more force and reduces the ball's rebound. This stroke was mastered by one of the greatest serve and volleyers of all time, John McEnroe.

The albums generated two books of poetry, BBC television shows, a West End musical, a pantomime (Captain Beaky and His Musical Christmas performed by Twiggy, Eleanor Bron, Keith Michell and Jeremy Lloyd at the Apollo Victoria Theatre, London, in December 1981), performances by the National Youth Ballet of Great Britain and a gala in aid of UNICEF performed by Roger Moore, Joanna Lumley, Jeremy Lloyd and the National Youth Ballet at the Royal Albert Hall, London, in December 2011. The first album was released on vinyl in 1977 and the second in 1980. Both were re-released on compact disc in 2002. Captain Beaky's band consist of Timid Toad, Reckless Rat, Artful Owl and Batty Bat. The title track from the first album, \\"Captain Beaky\\", was released as a 7 inch single with \\"Wilfred the Weasel\\" and \\"Blanche\\" on the B-side by Polydor in 1980; it reached Number 5 in the UK Singles Chart and number 36 in Australia. The song, sung by Keith Michell, informs us that: According to Jonathan Rowlands, the producer of both albums, when BBC Radio 1 disc jockey Noel Edmonds heard colleague Tony Blackburn play the record, \\"he grabbed it from his turntable, played it just once, and the result was that an atomic scientist who was on secondment with the British Museum, upon hearing the show and recognising that Captain Beaky's bete-noir Hissing Sid was not all that bad, wrote in [to the BBC] proclaiming \\"Hissing Sid Is Innocent Okay!\\". The character of Hissing Sid is a snake, mentioned in both \\"Captain Beaky\\" on the first album and \\"The Trial of Hissing Sid\\" on the second. The slogan \\"Hissing Sid is Innocent!\\" became a popular catch phrase, appearing everywhere including as a graffito on walls (sometimes as a modification for earlier \\"George Davis is Innocent!\\" graffiti, especially after Davis' second conviction), on badges, and on car stickers.

Education and career Goldman earned his BA from Columbia University and PhD from Princeton University, and previously taught at the University of Michigan (1963‚Äì1980), the University of Illinois, Chicago (1980‚Äì1983) and the University of Arizona (1983‚Äì1994). He joined the Rutgers faculty in 1994http://fas- philosophy.rutgers.edu/goldman/CV.pdf and retired in 2018.https://ruccs.rutgers.edu/component/jevents/icalrepeat.detail/2018/02/27/586/-/alvin- goldman-retirement-conference He is married to the ethicist Holly Martin Smith. Philosophical work Goldman has done influential work on a wide range of philosophical topics, but his principal areas of research are epistemology, philosophy of mind, and cognitive science. =Action theory= Goldman's early book, A Theory of Human Action (a revised version of his Ph.D. thesis), presents a systematic way of classifying and relating the many actions we perform at any time. Its influence was broad and can be found in, among other writings, John Rawls's book A Theory of Justice. Goldman's early work in action theory soon gave way to work in other branches of philosophy, most influentially epistemology. =Epistemology= Goldman's accounts of knowledge and justified belief, using notions like causation and reliability instead of normative concepts like permissibility and obligation, contributed to a philosophical approach that came to be known in the 1970s as naturalized epistemology. (Unlike W.V.O. Quine's version of naturalized epistemology, however, Goldman's retains a traditional focus on questions of justification.) Goldman's view emerged initially as part of the efforts in the 1960s to find a \\"fourth\\" condition in response to the Gettier challenge to the account of knowledge as \\"justified true belief.\\" In his 1967 paper, \\"A Causal Theory of Knowing\\", Goldman proposed that knowledge amounts to true belief appropriately caused by the fact that makes it true. Later, he claimed knowledge amounts to true belief that is produced by a reliable process.Goldman, Alvin I. Liaisons: Philosophy meets the cognitive and social sciences. Massachusetts Institute of Technology Press, 1992. (Chapter 5, 85-103) Goldman has described his \\"naturalistic\\" approach to epistemology as splitting \\"epistemology (individual epistemology, anyway) into two parts.... The first part is dedicated to the 'analytic' task of identifying the criteria, or satisfaction conditions, for various normative epistemic statuses. With respect to the normative status of justifiedness (of belief), the proposed criterion is the reliability of the belief-forming processes by which the belief is produced. Defense of this criterion of justifiedness was not based on scientific psychology, but rather a familiar form of armchair methodology. The second part is the task where science enters the picture. Psychological science is required to identify the kinds of operations or computations available to the human cognizer, how well they work when operating on certain inputs and under certain conditions.\\" More recently, Goldman has focused his epistemological efforts on questions of social epistemology, of the different social mechanisms through which knowledge is transmitted in society. His work in social epistemology has dealt with the law (especially evidence), voting and media, among other topics. He attempts to provide (in his words) a less radical view of social epistemology than those suggested by cultural theorists and postmodernists under that name. His approach uses tools of analytic philosophy especially formal epistemology to analyze problems in social knowledge. Some of this work is summarized in his book Knowledge in a Social World. =Other work= Goldman has devoted significant time to showing how research in cognitive science is relevant to a variety of branches of philosophy including epistemology. Much of this work appears in his books Epistemology and Cognition, Philosophical Applications of Cognitive Science, and Simulating Minds.

Discovery Found only below the surface, near the base of a tree on a slope leading to what was then known as Bulldog Gully, the nugget had a gross weight of (241 lb 10 oz). Its trimmed weight was (210 lbs), and its net weight was (192 lbs 11.5 oz). At the time of the discovery, there were no scales capable of weighing a nugget this large, so it was broken into three pieces on an anvil by Dunolly-based blacksmith Archibald Walls.\\"Wills and Bequests\\". Melbourne Punch (1 December 1887) Deason, Oates, and a few friends took the nugget to the London Chartered Bank of Australia, in Dunolly, which advanced them ¬£9,000.

He bought a small farm near Moliagul where he lived until he died in 1915, aged 85 years. Richard Oates was born about 1827 at Pendeen in Cornwall. After the 1869 find, Oates returned to the UK and married. He returned to Australia with his wife and they had four children.

It was formed after a merger between The Corporation and the Ministry of Darkness factions, who united while facing common adversaries Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Rock, The Union, and Mr. McMahon. In an infamous swerve, the latter would eventually be revealed as the power behind The Corporate Ministry who had intended to use the faction to destroy Austin.  History  = Background = Throughout early 1999, The Undertaker and his Ministry of Darkness had been feuding with WWF owner Mr. McMahon, trying to gain control of the Federation. To break Vince's spirits they began targeting his daughter Stephanie. Worried about his daughter, Vince shifted focus from his Corporation stable to Stephanie. With Vince occupied, his son Shane gradually took over the leadership of the Corporation. On April 12, Shane kicked Vince, Pat Patterson, and Gerald Brisco out of the Corporation. His rationale was that there was no room in the Corporation for the old and that Vince no longer had his priorities straight. Shane then slapped his father, saying that the strong, ruthless man he knew was gone. Heading into WrestleMania XV, Vince McMahon had been feuding with Stone Cold Steve Austin for an entire year. By this point, the Corporation was involved in the feud as well. The Rock, Vince's handpicked champion, lost his WWF Championship to Austin at WrestleMania XV and also lost a rematch at Backlash. Rock blamed the loss on Shane, who had been guest referee and accidentally hit Rock with the championship belt near the end of the match. The following night on Raw Is War, Rock insulted Shane and hit him Rock Bottom and was in turn fired from the Corporation. At Backlash, the Ministry kidnapped Stephanie. The Undertaker attempted to wed and sacrifice her the following night, but was ruined successfully by Stone Cold Steve Austin after two failed attempts by Ken Shamrock and the Big Show. Members of The Corporation had wanted to help Stephanie, but Shane held them back apparently trying to convince them that it could be a Ministry trap. = Formation = Stone Cold Steve Austin was the main target of this stable On April 27, the pilot episode of SmackDown!, The Undertaker merged his Ministry of Darkness with Shane's Corporation to form the Corporate Ministry. The two groups united in order to fight their common foes Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Rock, and Mr. McMahon. The members of both factions seemingly forgot their past conflicts and worked together as a massive stable. On the following episode of Raw Is War, a new faction formed to oppose the Corporate Ministry. Former Corporation members Ken Shamrock, Big Show, and Test joined together with Mankind to form The Union. The Union members felt that they were being screwed over by the Corporation ever since Shane had taken control of it from his father. Wanting revenge on his son, Vince soon united with the Union as they fought with the Corporate Ministry. = The Corporate Ministry = As the Corporate Ministry's first act, Shane ordered a WWF Championship match at Over the Edge between Austin and Undertaker with himself as a special guest referee. However, WWF Commissioner Shawn Michaels countered by adding Vince as another guest referee. That night, an altercation between the feuding McMahons collected Undertaker and Austin, and Shane fast-counted the pin to give the match and the title to Undertaker. That same night, The Rock defeated Triple H via disqualification and The Union defeated The Acolytes, Viscera, and Big Bossman in an elimination match. A week later, The Acolytes defeated X-Pac and Kane to win the WWF Tag Team Championship. Meanwhile, The Undertaker's claim that he served a higher power was expanded upon. Eventually, The Undertaker decided to offer Austin to this greater power, who revealed his identity to Austin while dressed in a black robe and a hood that hid his face from the audience. On June 7, the identity of the higher power was revealed as Vince McMahon, and the entire exercise had been a ruse designed to allow the McMahons to get revenge on Austin. After the unveiling, Linda and Stephanie McMahon, who were also victims of the ruse, used their combined 50% share in the WWF to punish Vince. Linda stepped down as CEO of the company, naming Austin as her replacement. Further, she and Stephanie were signing over their shares of the WWF to Austin. The Undertaker has stated that he considers the Corporate Ministry stable to be the low point of his \\"dark\\" era due to the diluting of power from himself to the McMahons. The McMahons challenged Austin to a winner-take-all handicap match at the King of the Ring. The match became a ladder match after Big Boss Man lost a match to Austin, allowing Austin to pick the stipulation. To punish him for the loss, Big Bossman was fired from the Corporate Ministry. With Steve Austin now feuding with the McMahons, The Undertaker faced a new challenger, The Rock. After Rock beat The Undertaker and Triple H in a handicap match, The Undertaker faced The Rock at King of the Ring for the title. Undertaker won the match, thanks to a run-in by Triple H. That same night, Vince and Shane defeated Austin in a ladder match to win his 50% share of the company and regain full control of the WWF. The following week, The Acolytes lost their tag team titles to the Hardy Boyz. Big Boss Man rejoined the Corporate Ministry the night after King of the Ring. After King of the Ring, Austin reinserted himself into a feud with The Undertaker by announcing that, while still CEO, he booked himself a title rematch with Undertaker, with the time and place to be determined by Austin. On the Raw Is War after King of the Ring, Austin defeated the Undertaker to regain the WWF Championship. At Fully Loaded, a First Blood match was signed with two stipulations. If Undertaker regained the title, Austin could never challenge for it again. If Austin was to retain, Vince McMahon would be forced to leave the WWF. Austin won by hitting The Undertaker with a television camera after an assist from X-Pac, thus retaining the title and forcing Vince out of the company. Meanwhile, The Acolytes defeated The Hardy Boyz and their manager Michael Hayes to regain the tag team titles, and Triple H defeated The Rock in a leather strap match to become the number one contender for the WWF Championship. and Big Bossman won the hardcore title from Al Snow. Two weeks later, the Acolytes would lose the tag team titles to X-Pac and Kane. = Dissolution = By the end of July, The Undertaker's relationship with the McMahons had dissolved and the Corporate Ministry was effectively disbanded by Shane McMahon on August 2, 1999. Shane continued to align himself with Triple H and Chyna, and on the Raw Is War following SummerSlam he helped Triple H defeat Mankind to win his first WWF Championship. The Acolytes stayed together and continued to wrestle under that name with no connection to anyone, eventually becoming the APA. Big Bossman continued his feud with Al Snow. The Undertaker, in the meantime, formed a new tag team with Big Show called the \\"Unholy Alliance\\", which eventually grew into a loose stable that included former Ministry members Mideon and Viscera. They defeated X-Pac and Kane at SummerSlam for the WWF Tag Team Championship, only to lose them a week later to the makeshift tag team of Mankind and The Rock, which became better known as the Rock 'n' Sock Connection. The following week, they regained the tag team titles in a Buried Alive match after Triple H buried Mankind following an attack on Big Show. Shortly after this, it was found that Undertaker suffered a torn groin and would require surgery, which necessitated a change in storyline. The team's scheduled defense against the former champions on Raw Is War two weeks later was turned into a Dark Side Rules match where any of the members of the Unholy Alliance could wrestle. This enabled Undertaker to avoid aggravating his injury, although the group lost the tag team titles back to the Rock 'n' Sock Connection. After Austin who told McMahon that according to the previous contract (which includes the \\"fine print\\" also according to Austin) the following night on RAW, he would reinstate him, provided that Austin granted him his title shot. McMahon agreed and considered himself reinstated and granted him the title shot, but told him that he will meet the winner of the match at Unforgiven. During that time, Undertaker was also set to compete in a Six-Pack Challenge WWF Championship match at Unforgiven against The Rock, Mankind, Kane, Big Show, and Triple H, requiring a change in those plans as well. One week after the group lost the tag team titles for the final time, Mr. McMahon forced Triple H to take part in a gauntlet match to keep his spot in the Unforgiven main event, with each match being considered the \\"specialty\\" match of the competitors. Undertaker was originally set to face Triple H in a casket match as part of the gauntlet, but Undertaker refused to compete and walked out on Mr. McMahon. Mideon and Viscera, who earlier had interfered in Triple H's inferno match against Kane, were forced to take Undertaker's place and won the match after Triple H was unable to put both men in a casket. After that, the remaining members of what was left of the Ministry went their separate ways. Big Show became the WWF Champion at that year's Survivor Series, while Viscera won the WWF Hardcore Championship and was eventually let go from the company.

Function  The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family. It is a critical autocrine growth factor as well as a mitogen for astrocytes, Schwann cells, and fibroblasts. It is ligand for epidermal growth factor (EGF) and it is related to transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha). This protein interacts with the Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) to promote the growth of normal epithelial cells. Biological role AREG is a critical factor in estrogen action and ductal development of the mammary glands. Amphiregulin has been found to be essential for mammary ductal development, as evidenced by absence of ductal growth in amphiregulin knockout mice. This is similar to the phenotypes of EGFR and ERŒ± knockout mice, which also show absence of ductal growth. Amphiregulin is expressed in many parts of body such as ovaries, placenta, pancreas, breasts, lungs and spleen. Expression of amphiregulin can be induced by TGF-Œ±, TNF-Œ±, interleukin 1, and prostaglandins. Clinical significance = Psoriasis = Mutations in this encoded protein are associated with a psoriasis-like skin phenotype. Higher circulating levels of amphiregulin are associated with AGVHD progression. = Cancer = Overexpression of amphiregulin is connected with cancer of the breast, prostate, colon, pancreas, lung, spleen, and bladder. = Rheumatoid arthritis = It seems that expression of AREG is connected with proliferation of fibroblasts and production of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 8 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).  Inflammation  Amphiregulin is part of cellular response type 2. It was found that the cell source of amphiregulin is innate lymphoid cells 2 (ILC2) which are dependent on interleukin 33. ILC2 expressed amphiregulin after tissue damage of the intestines and activation by IL-33. Moreover, endogenous AREG with IL-33 decreased the intestinal inflammation in mice with normal count of T-lymphocytes and in deficient mice.

Description  The theatre was usually a room of roughly amphitheatrical shape, in the centre of which would stand the table on which the dissections of human or animal bodies took place. Around this table were several circular, elliptic or octagonal tiers with railings, steeply tiered so that students or other observers could stand and get a good view of the dissection almost from above and unencumbered by the spectators in the rows in front. It was common to display skeletons at some place in the theatre; in Leiden, 17th-century depictions show that the living observers were actually accompanied in the rows by a large number of animal and human skeletons, some of which held banners with inscriptions such as Memento mori, or, freely translated, \\"Remember, you will die\\". The first anatomical Theatre was built at the University of Padua in 1594 and is still preserved. Other early examples include the Theatrum Anatomicum of Leiden University, built in 1596 and reconstructed in 1988, and the Anatomical Theatre of the Archiginnasio in Bologna (whose building dates from 1563 and the anatomical theatre from 1637). The anatomical theatre in Gustavianum in Uppsala. (1663) The anatomical theatre completed in 1663 by medical professor and amateur architect Olaus Rudbeck for the University of Uppsala is located in the idiosyncratic cupola which Rudbeck placed on top of the Gustavianum building, at the time the main building of the university. Rudbeck had spent time in Leiden, and both the anatomical theatre and the botanical garden he founded in Uppsala in 1655 were influenced by his experiences there. Today Gustavianum is open for the public under the name Museum Gustavianum. Thomas Jefferson built an anatomical theatre for the University of Virginia. It was completed in 1827 but demolished in 1939 after the construction of Alderman Library nearby.

Nabiximols is sold as a mouth spray intended to alleviate neuropathic pain, spasticity, overactive bladder, and other symptoms of multiple sclerosis; it was developed by the UK company GW Pharmaceuticals.UK Medicines Online Nabiximols Page accessed Feb 3, 2016Multiple Sclerosis Trust. October 2014 Sativex (nabiximols) - factsheet In 2019 it was proposed that following application of the spray, nabiximols is washed away from the oral mucosa by the saliva flow and ingested into the stomach, with subsequent absorption from the gastro-intestinal tract. Nabiximols is a combination drug standardized in composition, formulation, and dose. Its principal active cannabinoid components are the cannabinoids: tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). Each spray delivers a dose of 2.7 mg THC and 2.5 mg CBD. In May 2003 GW Pharmaceuticals and Bayer entered into an exclusive marketing agreement for GW's cannabis-based medicinal extract product, to be marketed under the brand name Sativex. \\"Bayer has obtained exclusive rights to market Sativex in the UK. In addition, Bayer has the option for a limited period to negotiate the marketing rights in other countries in European Union and selected other countries around the world.\\" In April 2011, GW licensed to Novartis the rights to commercialise nabiximols in Asia (excluding China and Japan), Africa and the Middle East (excluding Israel). Availability In June 2010, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency of the United Kingdom licensed nabiximols as a prescription- only medicine for the treatment of spasticity due to multiple sclerosis. This regulatory authorization represents the world's first full regulatory approval for the medicine. The spray is being marketed in the UK by Bayer Schering Pharma. Many people with MS cannot receive nabiximols due to local National Health Service (NHS) resistance to its funding; but, in August 2014, the NHS in Wales agreed to fund Sativex for people with multiple sclerosis. Nabiximols was also approved in Spain for MS spasticity in the second half of 2010 and was launched in that country in March 2011. It was approved in the Czech Republic in April 2011, in Germany in May 2011, in Denmark in June 2011 and in Sweden in January 2012 to people with MS who have not responded adequately to other medication for spasticity.Sativex (nabiximols), Swedish Medical Products Agency It has also been recommended for approval in Italy and Austria with formal approvals expected in these countries during 2011. In Spain and other European markets (excluding the UK), nabiximols will be marketed by Almirall. In Canada, nabiximols has been approved by Health Canada for the treatment of MS spasticity. It has also received a licence with conditions (NOC/c) for two additional uses: as adjunctive treatment for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain in multiple sclerosis,GW Pharmaceuticals. \\"Multiple Sclerosis \\". Accessed 24 July 2011. and also for pain due to cancer.GW Pharmaceuticals. \\"Cancer Pain \\" Accessed 24 July 2011. Nabiximols is available in a number of countries as an unlicensed medicine, which enables doctors to prescribe the product to people who they consider may benefit. The product has been exported from the UK to a total of 28 countries to date. In February 2007, GW and Otsuka Pharmaceutical announced an exclusive agreement for Otsuka to develop and market the drug in the United States. The first large scale US Phase IIb trial, Spray Trial, for people with cancer reported positive results in March 2010. GW and Otsuka have now commenced the Phase III development of nabiximols in cancer pain. In December 2012, Sativex was approved in Poland. In 2013, France legalized the use of cannabinoids in medicine, Sativex is the first one to be sold under prescription. Nevertheless, as of June 2016 this drug had still not actually been sold in pharmacies there. Effectiveness Of the two preliminary Phase III studies investigating the treatment of people with MS, one showed a reduction of spasticity of 1.2 points on the 0‚Äì10 points rating scale (versus 0.6 points under placebo), the other showed a reduction of 1.0 versus 0.8 points. Only the first study reached statistical significance. The Phase III approval study consisted of a run-in phase where the response of individuals to the drug was determined. The responders (42% of subjects) showed a significant effect in the second, placebo controlled, phase of the trial.Schubert-Zsilavecz, M, Wurglics, M, Neue Arzneimittel 2011/2012 A 2009 meta-analysis of six studies found large variations of effectiveness, with a ‚Äì statistically non-significant ‚Äì trend towards a reduction of spasticity. A systematic review in 2014 by the American Academy of Neurology found that nabiximols was 'probably effective' for spasticity, pain, and urinary dysfunction, but wasn't supported for tremor. Nabiximols has also been studied for cancer pain resistant to opioids. Adjuvant use was safe and effective in 3 trials for cancer pain, however the drug failed to meet its primary endpoint for this purpose in its first Phase III trial. Side effects In early clinical trials, nabiximols has generally been well tolerated. The most common adverse effects in Phase III trials were dizziness (25%), drowsiness (8%) and disorientation (4%); 12% of subjects stopped taking the drug because of the side effects. No investigations regarding the potential for dependence are available, but such a potential is unlikely considering the pharmacological properties of the two components.  Licensing  GW Pharmaceuticals were issued a unique license to cultivate cannabis for the manufacturing of Sativex in the UK, granting them the sole legal right to research in aerosolized cannabis derived therapeutics, which in April 2013 became commercially viable when the UK Government scheduled the Sativex formulation to part IV of the UK Drugs Act.

The Crown of the King of Bavaria is a part of the Bavarian Crown Jewels and was ordered and designed between 1804‚Äì1807 for Maximilian I after Napoleon had raised Bavaria to kingdom status. It was commissioned to the French goldsmith Jean-Baptiste de Lasne, who drew inspiration from the crown of Louis XV of France. Maximilian's alliance with Emperor Napoleon earned him the royal title and vast territorial increases at the Treaty of Pressburg (1805). This made him one of the chief members of the Confederation of the Rhine. His daughter was married to Napoleon's stepson, Eug√®ne de Beauharnais. Maximilian I ordered the regalia which can be seen today in the Treasury at the Residenz in Munich. Made by Biennais, the most famous French goldsmith of the day, the Royal Crown of Bavaria is set with rubies, diamonds, emeralds, sapphires and pearls. The Wittelsbach Diamond was removed and sold in 1931 by the Wittelsbach family. Like other royal insignia, the crown was not worn by the sovereign.

By the Routh‚ÄìHurwitz theorem, we have the following interpretation: the Cauchy index of :r(x) = p(x)/q(x) over the real line is the difference between the number of roots of f(z) located in the right half-plane and those located in the left half-plane. The complex polynomial f(z) is such that :f(iy) = q(y) + ip(y). We must also assume that p has degree less than the degree of q. Definition * The Cauchy index was first defined for a pole s of the rational function r by Augustin Louis Cauchy in 1837 using one-sided limits as: : I_sr = \\\\begin{cases} +1, & \\\\text{if } \\\\displaystyle\\\\lim_{x\\\\uparrow s}r(x)=-\\\\infty \\\\;\\\\land\\\\; \\\\lim_{x\\\\downarrow s}r(x)=+\\\\infty,  -1, & \\\\text{if } \\\\displaystyle\\\\lim_{x\\\\uparrow s}r(x)=+\\\\infty \\\\;\\\\land\\\\; \\\\lim_{x\\\\downarrow s}r(x)=-\\\\infty,  0, & \\\\text{otherwise.} \\\\end{cases} * A generalization over the compact interval [a,b] is direct (when neither a nor b are poles of r(x)): it is the sum of the Cauchy indices I_s of r for each s located in the interval. We usually denote it by I_a^br. * We can then generalize to intervals of type [-\\\\infty,+\\\\infty] since the number of poles of r is a finite number (by taking the limit of the Cauchy index over [a,b] for a and b going to infinity). Examples A rational function * Consider the rational function: :r(x)=\\\\frac{4x^3 -3x}{16x^5 -20x^3 +5x}=\\\\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}. We recognize in p(x) and q(x) respectively the Chebyshev polynomials of degree 3 and 5. Therefore, r(x) has poles x_1=0.9511, x_2=0.5878, x_3=0, x_4=-0.5878 and x_5=-0.9511, i.e. x_j=\\\\cos((2i-1)\\\\pi/2n) for j = 1,...,5. We can see on the picture that I_{x_1}r=I_{x_2}r=1 and I_{x_4}r=I_{x_5}r=-1. For the pole in zero, we have I_{x_3}r=0 since the left and right limits are equal (which is because p(x) also has a root in zero). We conclude that I_{-1}^1r=0=I_{-\\\\infty}^{+\\\\infty}r since q(x) has only five roots, all in [‚àí1,1]. We cannot use here the Routh‚ÄìHurwitz theorem as each complex polynomial with f(iy) = q(y) + ip(y) has a zero on the imaginary line (namely at the origin).

They played many gigs in and around Derby, most notably The Cosmo Club and The Ajanta and soon built up a large local following supporting bands such as The Clash and U.K. Subs Winfield and Smith were then replaced by Kev Nixon and Will Hoon before the group signed to Rondelet Records and re- releasing the \\"Four Sore Points EP\\" followed by \\"Let Them Free\\" in January 1981. Later that year, Anti-Pasti released their debut album, The Last Call, which reached the Top 40 in the UK Albums Chart. Their growing profile was confirmed when a third single, \\"Six Guns\\", appeared at the end of the year and reached number 1 in the UK Indie Chart, as did the joint venture with The Exploited on a 12\\" single EP, Don't Let 'Em Grind You Down which featured tracks \\"Ain't Got Me\\" and \\"Another Dead Soldier\\", both were recorded as part of The Wragby Studio Session Tapes in 1980. The latter spent one week at No. 70 in the UK Singles Chart in December 1981. In 1981 also saw the band take part in the \\"Apocalypse Now\\" tour with fellow third wave punk bands The Exploited, Discharge, Vice Squad, Chron Gen and The Anti Nowhere League. Winter 1981 saw Anti-Pasti tour America and Canada performing with Dead Kennedys, Naked Raygun and Flipper \\"East to the West\\", released in 1982, preceded the final Anti-Pasti album and single, both titled \\"Caution in the Wind\\", which featured Will Hoon's brother Ollie on guitar. A self-titled singles retrospective surfaced a year later, but the group split in 1984 following the firing of Roper. There was a reunion in 1995, leading to mini- tours of the UK and (Germany). After years working in the retail trade, Roper currently runs Real Ale Tours of Derby, and has various food related business interests. Bell has a financial interest in the Golddigga fashion chain. Reformation The band reformed in 2012, with a line up of Martin Roper (vocals), Ollie Hoon (lead guitar), Kev Nixon (drums) and new member Ben Hanson (bass). The first concert back after a 17-year absence was a warm up gig at The Horn at St. Albans on 31 July 2012, they then performed three days later as special guests at the Rebellion Festival. The third gig they played was at the 1st Annual Punk Gig at London's 229, along with Ruts DC, Glen Matlock and the Philistines, Discharge (band), The Business (band), Vice Squad, and Infa-Riot amongst others. During 2012 the band has also written and performed two new songs live \\"Viva Che\\" and \\"I See Red\\", which have been demoed along with re-workings of old songs \\"Last Train to Nowhere\\" and \\"Burn in Your Own Flames\\". A press statement said that the band would soon be releasing a four track EP; however, in January 2014 it was announced that Roper had decided to leave the band to pursue interests outside the music business. As of February 2014 Anti Pasti announced a new vocalist in the form of Gez Addictive and their intention to be playing material old and new at some of the pre Spannered Festival shows This line-up played various festivals around the U.K and Europe, including Rebellion and Pod Parou; as well as mini tours on the continent, most notably Germany. The band continued to write new material and finally, 34 years since their last studio album was released, laid down tracks for an upcoming album. The album was to be released in August 2016 and the band were asked to feature on the 20th anniversary of Rebellion Festival alongside other UK82 contemporary's such as The Exploited, Discharge, Chron Gen, Vice Squad and the Anti Nowhere League, however with the album set for release and shows arranged to promote it Gez was fired from the band. The Rebellion show was cancelled as were other festival and U.K dates. In August the album Rise Up was finally released to great reviews, and original member and lead singer Martin Roper agreed to fulfil gigs arranged in Antwerp and Paris; this however (because of Roper's work commitments) was agreed as a temporary measure. In the summer of 2017 vocal duties were assumed by Chron Gens Glynn Barber who split duties between the two bands. Following Barber's departure from the line-up Micky Bones briefly became the front man before the band decided to become a trio with bassist Ben Hanson becoming permanent lead vocalist.

The town's name is believed to be a derivation of the aboriginal word \\"moliagulk\\", meaning \\"wooded hill\\".Moliagul: Tiny and historically significant gold mining town. Retrieved on 17 January, 2015 from http://www.theage.com.au/news/Victoria/Moliagul/2005/02/17/1108500206985.html The area is notable for the discovery of a number of gold nuggets. These finds include the world's largest, the Welcome Stranger, which was discovered in 1869 by John Deason and Richard Oates. From what was once a thriving goldfields town, Moliagul today is a virtual ghost town and consists of a number of scattered houses. In 1855 it is estimated there were 16,000 people living in the immediate area during the peak of the Victorian gold rush period. Moliagul Post Office opened on 15 November 1858 and closed in 1971. The town is composed of scattered rural dwellings and small farms, a hotel (now closed), museum, the old school (now a hall) and former church. There are a number of historical points of interest including a stone monument to the Reverend John Flynn, founder of the Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia, who was born in Moliagul in 1880. The nearby Moliagul Cemetery contains the headstones of many families, such as the Deason's, which date back to the gold rush times. Within a few kilometers of the town can be found various gold mining areas including the site of the Welcome Stranger. Mount Moliagul itself is clearly visible from the town and offers superb views over the surrounding district.

On 1 January 2016, it became part of the new administrative region of Nouvelle-Aquitaine. It comprised three departments: Corr√®ze, Creuse, and Haute-Vienne. Situated mostly in the west side of south-central French Massif Central, Limousin had (in 2010) 742,770 inhabitants spread out on nearly , making it the least populated region of metropolitan France. Forming part of the southwest of the country, Limousin is bordered by the regions of Centre- Val de Loire to the north, Auvergne to the east, Midi-Pyr√©n√©es to the south, Aquitaine to the southwest, and Poitou-Charentes to the west. Limousin is also part of the larger historical Occitania region.  Formation  The modern region of Limousin is essentially composed of two historical French provinces: * Limousin: the department of Corr√®ze in its entirety and the central and southeastern part of Haute-Vienne. The entire old province of Limousin is contained within the modern Limousin. * Marche: most of the department of Creuse and the north of Haute-Vienne. The old province of Marche is almost entirely contained within the modern region of Limousin, with only a small part of Marche now belonging to the region of Centre. Beside these two main provinces, Limousin is also composed of small parts of other former provinces: * Angoumois: extreme south-west of Haute-Vienne * Poitou: extreme west of Haute-Vienne * Auvergne: extreme east of Creuse * Berry: extreme north of Creuse Today the province of Limousin is the most populous part of the Limousin region. Limoges, the historical capital and largest city of the province of Limousin, is the capital of the Limousin administrative region.  Population  With a slowly rising population of just under 750,000, Limousin is the second-least populous region in Metropolitan France after Corsica. The population of Limousin is aging and, until 1999, was declining. The department of Creuse has the oldest population of any in France. Between 1999 and 2004 the population of Limousin increased slightly, reversing a decline for the first time in decades.Yann Leurs, Recensement : rebond d√©mographique confirm√©, INSEE, 2006, see online  Major communities  Limoges, half-timbered house by the bridge Saint Martial * Brive-la-Gaillarde * Gu√©ret * Limoges * Panazol * Saint-Junien * Tulle * Ussel  Economy  Limousin is an essentially rural region. Famed for some of the best beef farming in the world, herds of Limousin cattle‚Äîa distinctive chestnut red‚Äîare a common sight in the region. The region is also a major timber producing area. Due to its rural locality, it is also famed for its groves of French Oak, so prized for its distinct characters and flavors in wine fermentation that vintner R√©my Martin has exclusive rights to its oak groves. It is a partnership that is over 100 years old. The regional capital, Limoges, was once an industrial power base, world- renowned for its porcelain and still a leader and innovator in electric equipment factories (which originally used porcelain as an insulator). However, large factories are now few in number. Limousin is the poorest region in Metropolitan France; only the overseas collectivities have a lower GDP per capita.  Geography and climate  =Bodies of water= Some of the rivers belonging to the Loire basin run through the north, west and east of the region, waterways belonging to that of the Dordogne through the south. The region is crossed by three major rivers: the Vienne, the Dordogne and the Charente (which has its source in Haute-Vienne). The region is well known for the high quality of its water and for offering first-rate fishing. Small river in Creuse, Limousin =Topography= The Limousin region is almost entirely an upland area. The lowest land is in the northwest of the region (approximately above sea level) and the highest land is roughly in the southeast (approximately above sea level). However, the greater part of the region is above .  History  Coat of Arms of Limousin Limousin is one of the traditional provinces of France. Its name derives from that of a Celtic tribe, the Lemovices, who had their capital at Saint-Denis-des-Murs and whose main sanctuary was recently found in Tintignac, a site which became a major site for Celtic studies thanks to unique objects which were found - such as the carnyces, unique in the whole Celtic world. http://tintignac.wix.com/tintignac-naves#!english/c11e3 Official website of Tintignac-Naves Viscount Aimar V of Limoges ( ‚Äì ) was a notable ruler of the region.  Culture  Flag of the Limousin region in France. = Language = Until the 1970s, Occitan was the primary language of rural areas. There remain several different Occitan dialects in use in Limousin, although their use is rapidly declining. These are: * Limousin () dialect * Auvergnat () dialect in the East/North-East * Languedocien () in the Southern fringe of Corr√®ze * in the North, the Crescent transition area between Occitan and French is sometimes considered as a separate (basically Occitan) dialect called Marchois (). = Cuisine = P√¢t√© aux pommes de terre is one of the specialties of Limousin, as well as of the neighbouring department of Allier. Clafoutis is a local dessert. = Music = Perhaps due to its rural character, Limousin has maintained a strong tradition of traditional music, with ancient instruments such as the bagpipe (called chabrette, Chabreta in occitan) and hurdy-gurdy remaining popular. * Festival 1001 Notes, music festival in Haute-Vienne, August * Festival de La Vezere, music festival in Corr√®ze July‚ÄìAugust * Festival du Haut Limousin, music festival in Haute-Vienne, July‚ÄìAugust * La Borie en Limousin, foundation of music in Haute-Vienne = Transportation = * The word limousine is derived from the name of the region.

At age 17, Jackson stormed the Marin County Courthouse with automatic weapons, kidnapping Superior Court Judge Harold Haley, prosecutor Gary Thomas, and three jurors. Escaping with the hostages, Jackson demanded the Soledad Brothers' immediate release from prison. The Soledad Brothers, a group of African American inmates facing charges for allegedly throwing a white prison guard to his death at San Quentin, included Jackson's elder brother George Jackson. None of the Soledad defendants we at the courthouse on the day of the attack. In an ensuing shootout, Jackson and Judge Haley were killed, along with two inmates already in the courtroom, who had readily joined the attack; prosecutor Thomas was paralyzed and one juror was seriously injured. The guns that Jackson used were registered to political activist Angela Davis, who previously formed a committee supporting the Soledad Brothers. Davis stood trial for alleged involvement in the kidnapping and was acquitted of all charges in June 1972. Personal life Jackson was the youngest of five children born to Lester and Georgia Bea Jackson. Raised in Pasadena, California, he attended St Andrew's School from 1965-67 for grades seven and eight, La Salle High School for ninth grade (1967‚Äì68), and then Blair High School through his junior year.  Revolutionary Activities  =Black Panthers= George Jackson includes passages in his 1971 book, Blood in My Eye, which he attributes to his brother Jonathan. These passages figure prominently in the development of the elder Jackson's theory of revolutionary praxis.Blood in My Eye (1971), pp. 11-12, 20, 23-24, 46, et. al. Jackson had occasionally worked as a bodyguard for political activist and Black Panther member Angela Davis. Davis would later endorse the \\"spirit\\" of Jackson. =Marin County incident= On August 7, 1970, Jackson brought a satchel containing three automatic firearms, registered to Davis, into the Marin County Hall of Justice, where Judge Haley was presiding over the trial of San Quentin inmate James McClain. Once inside Judge Haley's courtroom, Jackson drew an automatic gun, and, aided by McClain and Black Panther inmates Ruchell Cinque Magee and William Arthur Christmas, took Judge Haley as well as Deputy District Attorney Gary Thomas and three female jurors hostage. Jackson and the other kidnappers bound the hostages with piano wire and used psychological torture to enforce compliance. The militants proudly encouraged responding journalists to document their actions as they loaded the hostages into a rented van, with the intent of transporting them to a nearby radio station where they would demand that the Soledad Brothers be released, contrary to their lawful detainment under court order. Responding police fired on the van that Jackson was driving in an attempt to end the attack. During the shootout, Jonathan Jackson, Christmas, McClain, and Judge Haley were killed, while Magee and Deputy District Attorney Thomas were seriously injured. Jackson's son, Jonathan Jackson Jr., was born eight and a half months after his father's death. A monument on the premises to Judge Haley was the target of a follow-up attack perpetrated by the Weather Underground terrorist network in October of the same year.

Life Born in West Hartford, Connecticut, Collins was educated at the Loomis Chaffee Institute in Windsor, Connecticut, and graduated from Yale as a BA in 1951. He worked in the advertising department of Procter and Gamble, in Cincinnati, Ohio, before being conscripted into the US Army. While serving in the public affairs office of the Allied Headquarters in Paris, from 1953 to 1955, he met Dominique Lapierre with whom he would write several best-sellers over 43 years. He went back to Procter and Gamble and became the products manager of the new foods division in 1955. Disillusioned with commerce, he took to journalism and joined the Paris bureau of United Press International in 1956, and became the news editor in Rome in the following year, and later the MidEast bureau chief in Beirut. In 1959, he joined Newsweek as Middle East editor, based in New York City. He became the Paris bureau chief in 1961, where he would work until 1964, until he switched to writing books. In 1965, Collins and Dominique Lapierre published their first joint work, Is Paris Burning? (in French Paris br√ªle-t- il?), a tale of Nazi occupation of the French capital during World War II and Hitler's plans to destroy Paris should it fall into the hands of the Allies. The book was an instant success and was made into a movie in 1966 by director Ren√© Cl√©ment, starring Kirk Douglas, Glenn Ford and Alain Delon. In 1967, they co-authored Or I'll Dress you in Mourning about the Spanish bullfighter Manuel Ben√≠tez El Cordob√©s. In 1972, after five years' research and interviews, they published O Jerusalem! about the birth of Israel in 1948, turned into a movie by Elie Chouraqui. In 1975, they published Freedom at Midnight, a story of the Indian Independence in 1947, and the subsequent assassination of Mahatma Gandhi in 1948. It is said they spent $300,000 researching and still emerged wealthy. The duo published their first fictional work, The Fifth Horseman, in 1981. It describes a terrorist attack on New York masterminded by Libya's Colonel Gaddafi. The book had such a shocking effect that the French President cancelled the sale of nuclear reactors to Libya, even though it was meant for peaceful purposes. Paramount Pictures, which was planning a film based on the book, dropped the idea in fear that fanatics would emulate the scenario in real life. In 1985, Collins authored Fall from Grace (without Lapierre) about a woman agent sent into occupied France who realizes she may be betrayed by her British masters if necessary. He also wrote Maze: A Novel (1989), and Black Eagles (1992), a semi-fictional novel about two conflicted American agents in Manuel Noreiga¬¥s Panama. He also wrote Le Jour Du Miracle: D-Day Paris (1994) and Tomorrow Belongs To Us (1998). Shortly before his death, he collaborated with Lapierre on Is New York Burning? (2005), a novel mixing fictional characters and real-life figures that speculates about a terrorist attack on New York City. In 2005, while working from his home in Fr√©jus, France, on a book about the Middle East, Collins died of a sudden cerebral haemorrhage. Personal life In 1966, Collins married Nadia Sultan. They had two sons, Michael and Lawrence. Awards Collins won the Deauville American Film Festival literary award in 1985, and the Mannesman Talley literary prize in 1989.

Stafford is best known for providing the voice of Woody Woodpecker, a creation of Lantz's, from 1950 to 1991. Career Stafford appeared in feature live-action films from 1935's Dr. Socrates to 1975's Doc Savage: The Man of Bronze. Some of her more notable roles were in the films Anthony Adverse and Blossoms in the Dust. Around the time the Woody Woodpecker short Drooler's Delight was in production, Mel Blanc, who had originally supplied Woody's voice and laugh, filed a lawsuit against producer Walter Lantz, claiming that Lantz had used his voice in later cartoons without permission. The judge, however, ruled for Lantz, saying that Blanc had failed to copyright his voice or his contributions. Though Lantz won the case, he paid Blanc in an out-of-court settlement when Blanc filed an appeal. Wanting to avoid any future retaliation from voice artists wanting to sue him, Lantz opted to find a new voice actor to replace Ben Hardaway as Woody's talking voice, as well as a definitive version of the laugh for his star woodpecker. In 1950, Lantz held anonymous auditions. Stafford offered to do Woody's voice, but Lantz turned her down because Woody was a male character. Not discouraged in the least, Grace made her own anonymous audition tape and submitted it to the studio. Not knowing who was behind the voice he heard, Lantz picked Grace's voice for Woody Woodpecker. Stafford provided Woody's voice from 1950 to 1991. At first, she asked not to be credited in the role, as she believed that audiences both young and old would be \\"disillusioned\\" if they knew Woody was voiced by a woman. But she soon came to enjoy being known as Woody's voice and, starting with 1958's Misguided Missile, finally allowed her name to be credited on screen. Stafford also appeared on an episode of What's My Line? on November 10, 1963. Death Gracie Lantz died of spinal cancer on March 17, 1992, at age 88.

Country of origin label for a product designed in the United States, but manufactured in China. Country of origin (COO), represents the country or countries of manufacture, production, design, or brand origin where an article or product comes from. For multinational brands, COO may include multiple countries within the value- creation process. There are differing rules of origin under various national laws and international treaties. Country of origin labelling (COOL) is also known as place-based branding, the made-in image or the \\"nationality bias.\\" In some regions or industries, country of origin labelling may adopt unique local terms such as terroir used to describe wine appellations based on the specific region where grapes are grown and wine manufactured. Place-based branding has a very ancient history. Archaeological evidence points to packaging specifying the place of manufacture dating back to some 4,000 years ago. Over time, informal labels evolved into formal, often regulated labels providing consumers with information about product quality, manufacturer name and place of origin. Definition Country of origin of a product can have several possible definitions. It can refer to: : (a) \\"the place from which the merchandise was directly received; that is the last border crossed or port entered before reaching its final destination; : (b) the country of consignment (i.e. from where the goods were sold); or, : (c) the country of original growth or extraction.\\" History of country-of-origin labelling The distinctive shape and markings on amphorae provided consumers with information about the manufacturer and the place of origin for goods The inclusion of place of origin on manufactured goods has an ancient history. In antiquity, informal branding which included details such as the name of manufacturer and place of origin were used by consumers as important clues as to product quality. David Wengrow has found archaeological evidence of brands, which often included origin of manufacture, dating to around 4,000 years ago. Producers began by attaching simple stone seals to products which, over time, were transformed into clay seals bearing impressed images, often associated with the producer's personal identity thus providing information about the product and its quality. For instance, an object found in a royal burial tomb in Abydos (southern Egypt) and dating to around 3,000 B.C.E., carries brand elements that would be very familiar to modern consumers. Inscriptions on the surface denote a specific place of manufacture, \\"finest oil of Tjehenu,\\" a region in modern-day Libya. In China, place-names appear to have developed independently during the Han Dynasty (220 BC-AD 200); brand names and place names were relatively commonplace on goods. Eckhardt and Bengtsson have argued that in the absence of a capitalist system, branding was connected to social systems and cultural contexts; that brand development was a consumer-initiated activity rather than the manufacturer-push normally associated with Western brand management practices.Eckhardt, Giana M.; Bengtsson, Anders (2008). \\"Pulling the White Rabbit Out of the Hat: Consuming Brands in Imperial China\\". Advances in Consumer Research. European Conference Proceedings. 8: 128. Diana Twede has shown that amphorae used in Mediterranean trade between 1500 and 500 BCE exhibited a wide variety of shapes and markings, which provided information for purchasers during exchange. Systematic use of stamped labels dates appears to date from around the fourth century BCE. In a largely pre- literate society, the shape of the amphora and its pictorial markings functioned as a brand, conveying information about the contents, region of origin and even the identity of the producer which were understood to function as signs of product quality. The Romans preferred to purchase goods from specific places, such as oysters from Londinium and cinnamon from a specific mountain in Arabia, and these place-based preferences stimulated trade throughout Europe and the Middle East. In Pompeii and nearby Herculaneum, archaeological evidence also points to evidence of branding and labelling in relatively common use. Wine jars, for example, were stamped with names, such as \\"Lassius\\" and \\"L. Eumachius;\\" probably references to the name of the producer. Carbonized loaves of bread, found at Herculaneum, indicate that some bakers stamped their bread with the producer's name. Umbricius Scauras, a manufacturer of fish sauce (also known as garum) in Pompeii c. 35 C.E., was branding his amphora which travelled across the entire Mediterranean. Mosaic patterns in the atrium of his house were decorated with images of amphora bearing his personal brand and quality claims. The mosaic comprises four different amphora, one at each corner of the atrium, and bearing labels as follows: : 1. G(ari) F(los) SCO[m]/ SCAURI/ EX OFFI[ci]/NA SCAU/RI Translated as \\"The flower of garum, made of the mackerel, a product of Scaurus, from the shop of Scaurus\\" : 2. LIQU[minis]/ FLOS Translated as: \\"The flower of Liquamen\\" : 3. G[ari] F[los] SCOM[bri]/ SCAURI Translated as: \\"The flower of garum, made of the mackerel, a product of Scaurus\\" : 4. LIQUAMEN/ OPTIMUM/ EX OFFICI[n]/A SCAURI Translated as: \\"The best liquamen, from the shop of Scaurus\\" Scauras' fish sauce was known to be of very high quality across the Mediterranean and its reputation travelled as far away as modern France. By the 19th century, formal labels featuring manufacturer name and place of manufacture had become relatively common. Picture Apothecary bottles, c. 1860 During the Medieval period in Europe, numerous market towns sprang up and competition between them intensified. In response to competitive pressures, towns began investing in developing a reputation for quality produce, efficient market regulation and good amenities for visitors. By the thirteenth century, English counties with important textile industries were investing in purpose built halls for the sale of cloth. London's Blackwell Hall became a centre for cloth, Bristol became associated with a particular type of cloth known as Bristol red, Stroud was known for producing fine woollen cloth, the town of Worsted became synonymous with a type of yarn; Banbury and Essex were strongly associated with cheeses. Casson and Lee have argued that the chartered markets of England and Europe in medieval times were using the regional market's reputation as a sign of produce quality and that this acted as an early form of branding. Following the European age of expansion, goods were imported from afar. Marco Polo, for example, wrote about silk from China and spices from India. Consumers began to associate specific countries with merchandise - calico cloth from India, porcelain, silk and tea from China, spices from India and South-East Asia and tobacco, sugar, rum and coffee from the New World. By the late 19th century, European countries began introducing country of origin labelling legislation. In the 20th century, as markets became more global and trade barriers removed, consumers had access to a broader range of goods from almost anywhere in the world. Country of origin is an important consideration in purchase decision-making. Effects on consumers The effects of country of origin labeling on consumer purchasing have been extensively studied. The country of origin effect is also known as the \\"made-in image\\" and the \\"nationality bias.\\" Research shows that consumers' broad general perceptions of a country, including of its national characteristics, economic and political background, history, traditions, and representative products, combine to create an overall image or stereotype that is then attached to the products of that country or countries, as occurs for multinational brands. For example, a global survey carried out by Nielsen, reported that Country of origin image has a significant influence on consumer perceptions and behaviours, and in situations in which additional information is unavailable or difficult to get can be the sole determinant of whether or not someone buys a product. Its effect is strongest on consumers who do not know much about the product or product type, and weakest on consumers who are well-informed. Sensitivity to country of origin varies by product category. It is strongest for durable goods and luxury goods and weakest for \\"low involvement\\" product categories such as shampoo and candy. In various studies it has also been proven that the Country-of-Origin Effect also applies to services. Several studies have shown that consumers tend to have a relative preference to products from their own country or may have a relative preference for or aversion against products that originate from certain countries (so-called affinity and animosity countries). Labelling requirements The requirements for Country of Origin markings are complicated by the various designations which may be required such as \\"Made in X\\", \\"Product of X\\", \\"Manufactured in X\\" etc. They also vary by country of import and export. For example: * For imports to the United Kingdom, there is a voluntary code for Food. Other products are not subject to labelling requirements, but misleading labelling can result in prosecution under the Trade Descriptions Act 1968. * Food exported to the United Arab Emirates must include Country of Origin =United States= Ford automobile hubcap Section 304 of the Tariff Act of 1930 as amended () requires most imports, including many food items, to bear labels informing the ultimate purchaser of their country of origin. Meats, produce, and several other raw agricultural products generally were exempt. The 2002 farm bill (P.L. 107-171, Sec. 10816), however, contains a requirement that many retail establishments provide, starting on September 30, 2004, country-of-origin information on fresh fruits and vegetables, red meats, seafood, and peanuts. However, the consolidated FY2004 appropriation (P.L. 108-199) signed January 23, 2004, delayed this requirement for two years except for seafood. The Textile Fiber Products Identification Act and Wool Products Labeling Act require a Made in USA label on clothing and other textile or wool household products if the final product is manufactured in the U.S. of fabric that is manufactured in the U.S., regardless of where materials earlier in the manufacturing process (for example, the yarn and fiber) came from. Textile products that are imported must be labeled as required by the Customs Service. A textile or wool product partially manufactured in the U.S. and partially manufactured in another country must be labeled to show both foreign and domestic processing. On a garment with a neck, the country of origin must be disclosed on the front of a label attached to the inside center of the neck, either midway between the shoulder seams or very near another label attached to the inside center of the neck. On a garment without a neck and on other kinds of textile products, the country of origin must appear on a conspicuous and readily accessible label on the inside or outside of the product. Catalogs and other mail order promotional materials for textile and wool products, including those disseminated on the Internet, must disclose whether a product is made in the U.S., imported, or both. The Fur Products Labeling Act requires the country of origin of imported furs to be disclosed on all labels and in all advertising. The American Automobile Labeling Act requires that each automobile manufactured on or after October 1, 1994, for sale in the U.S. bear a label disclosing where the car was assembled, the percentage of equipment that originated in the U.S. and Canada, and the country of origin of the engine and transmission. Any representation that a car marketer makes that is required by the AALA is exempt from the Commission‚Äôs policy. When a company makes claims in advertising or promotional materials that go beyond the AALA requirements, it will be held to the Commission‚Äôs standard. The Buy American Act requires that a product be manufactured in the U.S. of more than 50 percent U.S. parts to be considered Made in USA for government procurement purposes. For more information, review the Buy American Act at 41 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 10a-10c, the Federal Acquisition Regulations at 48 C.F.R. Part 25, and the Trade Agreements Act at 19 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 2501-2582. The Lanham Act gives any person (such as a competitor) who is damaged by a false designation of origin the right to sue the party making the false claim.  See also  * Mandatory country-of-origin labeling of food sold in the United States (mCOOL) =COO marketing= Companies may indicate the origin of their products with a number of different marketing strategies: * Use of the phrase \\"Made in...\\" * Use of quality and origin labels * COO embedded in the company name * Typical COO words embedded in the company name * Use of the COO language * Use of famous or stereotypical people from the COO * Use of COO flags and symbols * Use of typical landscapes or famous buildings from the COO International trade When shipping products from one country to another, the products may have to be marked with country of origin, and the country of origin will generally be required to be indicated in the export/import documents and governmental submissions. Country of origin will affect its admissibility, the rate of duty, its entitlement to special duty or trade preference programs, antidumping, and government procurement. Today, many products are an outcome of a large number of parts and pieces that come from many different countries, and that may then be assembled together in a third country. In these cases, it's hard to know exactly what is the country of origin, and different rules apply as to how to determine their \\"correct\\" country of origin. Generally, articles only change their country of origin if the work or material added to an article in the second country constitutes a substantial transformation, or, the article changes its name, tariff code, character or use (for instance from wheel to car). Value added in the second country may also be an issue. In principle, the substantial transformation of a product is intended as a change in the harmonized system coding. For example, a rough commodity sold from country A to country B, than subjected of a transformation in country B, which sells the final processed commodity to a country C is considered a sufficient step to label the end product made in B. Film and television production The International Federation of Film Archives defines the country of origin as the \\"country of the principal offices of the production company or individual by whom the moving image work was made\\". No consistent reference or definition exists. Sources include the item itself, accompanying material (e.g. scripts, shot lists, production records, publicity material, inventory lists, synopses etc.), the container (if not an integral part of the piece), or other sources (standard and special moving image reference tools). In law, definitions of \\"country of origin\\" and related terms are defined differently in different jurisdictions. The European Union, Canada, and the United States have different definitions for a variety of reasons, including tax treatment, advertising regulations, distribution; even within the European Union, different member states have different legislation. As a result, an individual work can have multiple countries as its \\"country of origin\\", and may even have different countries recognized as originating places for the purpose of different legal jurisdictions. Under copyright law in the United States and other signatories of the Berne Convention, \\"country of origin\\" is defined in an inclusive way to ensure the protection of intellectual rights of writers and creators.

UK), is a consumer magazine and digital publisher in the United Kingdom, with a portfolio selling over 350 million copies each year. It is owned by Future plc. History  = Origins = The British magazine publishing industry in the mid-1950s was dominated by a handful of companies, principally the Associated Newspapers (founded by Lord Harmsworth in 1890), Odhams Press Ltd, George Newnes Publishers, C. Arthur Pearson, and the Hulton Press, which fought each other for market share in a highly competitive marketplace. = Fleetway = In 1958 Cecil Harmsworth King, chairman of the newspaper group, The Daily Mirror Newspapers Limited which included the Daily Mirror and the Sunday Pictorial (now the Sunday Mirror), together with provincial chain West of England Newspapers, made an offer for Amalgamated Press. The offer was accepted, and in January 1959 he was appointed its chairman. Within a few months he changed its name to Fleetway Publications, Ltd. after the name of its headquarters, Fleetway House in London's Farringdon Street. Shortly thereafter, Odhams Press absorbed both George Newnes and the Hulton Press. King saw an opportunity in this to rationalise the overcrowded women's magazine market, in which Fleetway and Newnes were the major competitors, and made a bid for Odhams on behalf of Fleetway that was too attractive to ignore. Fleetway took over Odhams in the month of March 1961. = International Publishing Company = In consequence, King controlled publishing interests which included two national daily and two national Sunday newspapers (the newspaper interests being informally tagged The Mirror Group), along with almost one hundred consumer magazines, more than two hundred trade and technical periodicals, and interests in book publishing. This included the combined business interests of Fleetway, Odhams, and Newnes. All of the companies involved had been acquired without any significant change in management, save for the appointment of Mirror Group directors as chairmen. In 1963 all the companies were combined by the creation of a parent (or \\"holding\\") company called the International Publishing Company (known informally as IPC). All of the existing companies would continue to exist, but as IPC subsidiaries.Birch, Paul. \\"Speaking Frankly,\\" Birmingham Mail (14 December 2008).  Reorganization  IPC then set up a management development department in 1965, to rationalise its holdings, so that its various subsidiaries would no longer be in competition with each other for the same markets. This led to a reorganisation of the Group, in 1968, into six divisions: * IPC Newspapers ‚Äì including The People and The Sun (soon sold), as well as the Daily Mirror and Sunday Pictorial * IPC Magazines ‚Äì consumer magazines and comics * IPC Trade and Technical ‚Äì specialist magazines (later known as IPC Business Press Ltd.) * IPC Books ‚Äì all book publishing (headed by Paul Hamlyn, whose own company had been acquired by IPC). * IPC Printing ‚Äì all non-newspaper printing operations (headed by Arnold Quick, whose own company had also been acquired by IPC). * IPC New Products ‚Äì launching pad for products which used new technology (headed by Alistair McIntosh). All the divisions were headed by chairmen who originated in Mirror Group, except for Hamlyn, Quick and McIntosh. Also in 1968, a boardroom coup replaced Cecil King with his deputy chairman, Hugh Cudlipp, a former newspaper editor. = Reed International takeover = Cudlipp had no interest in management, and was uneasy both with his new role and with IPC's diversification into computerised publication and other new technology. In 1969 he therefore proposed to former Mirror Group director Don Ryder, who was then chairman of the Reed Group, in which IPC had a 30% shareholding, to mount a reverse take-over of IPC by Reed. IPC-Mirror Group was thus itself taken over in 1970, by the paper-making company Albert E Reed, which then renamed itself Reed International.Reed Elsevier profile on ketupa.net In 1974, part of the publishing interests of Reed International were separated into IPC Magazines Ltd (comprising the magazine and comics holdings) and Mirror Group Newspapers (comprising the newspaper holdings). The latter was sold to Pergamon Holdings Ltd, a private company owned by Robert Maxwell, in 1984.Trinity Mirror Group History on the Trinity Mirror Group website In 1988, IPC acquired Family Circle from the International Thomson Organization. In 1989, IPC acquired TVTimes. In the early 1990s IPC launched Loaded, which began a wave of \\"lad's mags\\". In 1992, following a merger with Dutch science publisher Elsevier NV, Reed International underwent a further name change, becoming Reed Elsevier (now RELX Group).  Sale of Fleetway  In 1987, part of the comics holdings of IPC Magazines Ltd (comprising those comics and characters created after 1 January 1970, plus 26 specified characters from Buster, which was then still being published) were placed in a separate company, Fleetway Publications, which was sold to Pergamon Holdings.History of IPC Media on the IPC Media website In 1991, Egmont UK purchased Fleetway from Pergamon, merging it with their own comics publishing operation, London Editions, to form Fleetway Editions. The latter was absorbed into the main Egmont brand by 2000, having sold off the continuing titles (such as 2000 AD), and continued with only reprint and licensed titles (e.g. Sonic The Comic). IPC had retained the other comics characters and titles, i.e. those created before 1970 (except the 26 characters from Buster), including Sexton Blake, The Steel Claw, and Battler Britton. One character, Dan Dare, was sold separately and is currently owned by the Dan Dare Corporation. In August 2016, Egmont sold its remaining library of IPC/Fleetway to Rebellion Developments, who had previously acquired 2000 AD in 2000. = Time Inc. takeover = In 1998, IPC Magazines Ltd was subject to a management buyout financed by Cinven, a venture capital group, and the company was renamed IPC Media. Cinven then sold the company to Time Inc., then the magazine publishing subsidiary of Time Warner, in 2001.Time Inc to acquire IPC from Cinven from Time Warner website In January 2009, the company's chief executive became Evelyn Webster, replacing Sylvia Auton who had run it since 2001 IPC Media formally became Time Inc.

It contains a scene of dialogue between George Washington and Lisa in which he makes a reference to ‚ÄúKentuckians‚Äù. It also features Gilbert Stuart's unfinished 1796 painting of George Washington. In its original airing, it contains an extended scene of Jebediah‚Äôs ‚Äúconfession‚Äù. After he finishes narrating it and laughs we see that he wrote the laughs in the confession and Lisa is now reading the laughs. This is followed by a final confession he has Diptheria which Lisa then reacts to. The episode features two neologisms, embiggen and cromulent, which were intended to sound like real words but are in fact completely fabricated (although it was later discovered that C. A. Ward had used \\"embiggen\\" in 1884). Embiggen, coined by Dan Greaney, has since been used in several scientific publications, while cromulent, coined by David X. Cohen, appeared in Dictionary.com's 21st Century Lexicon. Plot As Springfield celebrates its bicentennial, Miss Hoover assigns Lisa's second- grade class essays on Jebediah Springfield, the town's founder. Meanwhile, Mayor Quimby proclaims Homer the town crier during tryouts for historical figures in the town's upcoming celebration. Because his \\"criering\\" is better than Ned Flanders', Homer seizes Ned's heirloom hat and bell as props. Lisa visits the town's historical society to research Jebediah's life. She meets the Antiquarian curator who gives her access to Jebediah‚Äôs possessions. While playing his fife, she discovers his ‚Äúconfession‚Äù and his secret past as a pirate known as Hans Sprungfeld until 1796. After trying to kill George Washington, he wrote his confession on the back of Washington's portrait and hid it in his fife, thinking the \\"half-wits\\" of Springfield would never find it. Lisa tries to convince the town her claims are true but is met with disbelief and outright hostility. When she shows the confession to Hollis Hurlbut, the museum curator, he dismisses it as an obvious forgery. Miss Hoover gives Lisa an F for her essay, which she derides as \\"dead white male bashing by a PC thug\\". Lisa conducts more independent research on Jebediah and discovers more secrets and that he had a prosthetic silver tongue. She persuades the municipal government to exhume his body to search for it. When the coffin is opened, his skeleton contains no silver tongue. Exasperated at Lisa's meddling of history, Quimby strips Homer of his \\"criering\\" outfit and duties. After seeing the incomplete portrait of George Washington in her classroom, Lisa realizes the piece of paper containing the confession is the bottom half of the portrait. She confronts Hurlbut, who admits that he stole the silver tongue and hid it in the museum in order to protect his career and the myth of Jebediah. After realizing it is wrong to idealize and celebrate a pirate, Lisa and Hollis decide to reveal the true story of Jebediah's life. As Lisa is about to share the truth with the parading townspeople, a sniper takes aim, but is told to wait and see what she has to say. She realizes that Jebediah's myth inspires them and decides to keep the truth a secret. As a proud Homer watches her, he notices Ned in the parade acting as the town crier again. Irate, he pushes Ned out of the parade to take his place, and allows Lisa to ring Ned's bell while sitting on his shoulder. Production Donald Sutherland guest-starred in the episode as the voice of the historian. The story was inspired by the real events surrounding the exhumation of President Zachary Taylor. In the late 1980s, college professor and author Clara Rising theorized that Taylor was murdered by poison and was able to convince Taylor's closest living relative and the Coroner of Jefferson County, Kentucky, to order an exhumation. On June 17, 1991, Taylor's remains were exhumed and transported to the Office of the Kentucky Chief Medical Examiner, who found that the level of arsenic was much smaller than would be expected if Taylor had been thus poisoned. The remains were then returned to the cemetery and received appropriate honors at reinterment. Then-show runner Bill Oakley said \\"Lisa the Iconoclast\\" is \\"essentially the same\\" story but with Lisa in the role as Rising. At the end of the episode, an ode to Jebediah Springfield is played over the credits. The music and lyrics were written by Jeff Martin. Donald Sutherland voiced the historian in this episode. The script was specifically written with him in mind playing that part. Sutherland wanted to do the voice recordings as one would do a film and start in the middle of the script, so that he could get to know the character, but that idea was abandoned. In the episode, Lisa joked she was getting over her \\"Chester A. Arthuritis\\", a play on the word \\"arthritis\\" and the name of Chester A. Arthur. Sutherland ad-libbed the line \\"you had arthritis?\\", and the producers liked it so much that they kept it. The episode opens with an old documentary on Jebediah Springfield, starring Troy McClure as Springfield. The writers tried to make this documentary seem as lousy and low-budget as possible. One of these tricks was to have post-production add scratches to the animation. The animators added production errors that would occur in a low-budget film. For example, a man in the crowd looks at the camera, some of the people are wearing wristwatches, McClure's stuntman does not have the same sideburns as he does, and a boom microphone can be seen entering the frame. In the Historical Society, the animators spent a significant amount of time decorating the walls. Besides numerous historical references, they also decorated the walls with The Simpsons characters in 18th-century settings. The first painting shows Otto Mann driving children in a horse-drawn carriage. Another painting shows Marge Simpson in silhouette. The last painting shows Professor Frink holding a kite in the manner of Benjamin Franklin. Cultural references Gilbert Stuart's unfinished 1796 painting of George Washington, also known as The Athenaeum, plays an important part in \\"Lisa the Iconoclast\\". The Historical Society of Springfield contains references to historical figures and facts. The episode features Gilbert Stuart's unfinished 1796 painting of George Washington and tells a fictional backstory of how it came to be. In reality, the painting was unfinished and it did not have a part torn off. Hurlbut mentions the American revolutionaries William Dawes and Samuel Allyne Otis as equals to Jebediah Springfield. When Lisa passes out the \\"Wanted for treason\\" posters, it is a reference to those featuring John F. Kennedy, which were circulated in Dallas prior to his assassination. Hurlbut claims Springfield's confessions are \\"just as fake\\" as the will of Howard Hughes and the diaries of Adolf Hitler, both of which are proven forgeries. The opening couch gag shows the Simpson family in blue boxes similar to the style of The Brady Bunch. Chief Wiggum is singing \\"Camptown Races\\" from 1850 by Stephen Foster ventriloquised with the skull of Jebediah Springfield. Lisa's dream in which Washington and Springfield are fighting is a reference to Lethal Weapon. When Lisa is telling the people at Moe's Tavern about the real history of Jebediah Springfield, they all sit with their mouths open. This is a reference to a scene in the film The Producers from 1968. When Homer knocks over Ned Flanders in order to take over his job as town crier, it is a reference to the film National Lampoon's Animal House from 1978. Lisa's decision to hide the truth to preserve the myth of Jebediah Springfield is a reference to the film The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. In addition to these cultural references, at least one author has compared this episode to Friedrich Nietzsche's short work On the Advantage and Disadvantage of History for Life.Boven, David (November 2003), \\"Nietzsche, The Simpsons, and History\\", The SNUH Journal 1 (1). Embiggen and cromulent  The episode features two neologisms: embiggen and cromulent. The showrunners asked the writers if they could come up with two words which sounded like real words, and these were what they came up with. The Springfield town motto is \\"A noble spirit embiggens the smallest man.\\" Schoolteacher Edna Krabappel comments that she had never heard the word embiggen until she moved to Springfield. Miss Hoover, another teacher, replies, \\"I don't know why; it‚Äôs a perfectly cromulent word.\\" Later in the episode, while talking about Homer's audition for the role of town crier, Principal Skinner states, \\"He's embiggened that role with his cromulent performance.\\" Embiggen‚Äîin the context in which it is used in the episode‚Äîis a verb that was coined independently by Dan Greaney in 1996. The literal meaning is to make something larger, with the morphology (em- + big + -en) being parallel to that of enlarge (en- + large). The verb had in fact previously occurred in an 1884 edition of the British journal Notes and Queries: A Medium of Intercommunication for Literary Men, General Readers, Etc. by C. A. Ward, in the sentence \\"but the people magnified them, to make great or embiggen, if we may invent an English parallel as ugly. After all, use is nearly everything.\\" The word has made its way to common use and was included in Mark Peters' Yada, Yada, Do'h!, 111 Television Words That Made the Leap From the Screen to Society. In 2018, it was included in the Merriam- Webster dictionary and the online Oxford English Dictionary. In particular, embiggen can be found in string theory. The first occurrence of the word was in the journal High Energy Physics in the article \\"Gauge/gravity duality and meta-stable dynamical supersymmetry breaking\\", which was published on January 23, 2007. For example, the article says: \\"For large P, the three-form fluxes are dilute, and the gradient of the Myers potential encouraging an anti-D3 to embiggen is very mild.\\" Later this usage was noted in the journal Nature, which explained that in this context, it means to grow or expand. Cromulent is an adjective that was coined by David X. Cohen. Since it was coined, it has appeared in Dictionary.com's 21st Century Lexicon. The meaning of cromulent is inferred only from its usage, which indicates that it is a positive attribute. Dictionary.com defines it as meaning fine or acceptable. Ben Macintyre has written that it means \\"valid or acceptable\\". Reception In its original broadcast, \\"Lisa the Iconoclast\\" finished 70th in the ratings for the week of February 12 to 18, 1996. The episode was the sixth highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following The X-Files, Melrose Place, Beverly Hills, 90210, Married... with Children, and Fox Tuesday Night Movie: Cliffhanger. The episode received extremely positive reviews from television critics. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson lauded it for the focus on Lisa, commenting that \\"Lisa- centered episodes tend to be preachy, but I suppose that‚Äôs inevitable given her character. I like the fact Lisa takes the high road here, though, as she proves she doesn‚Äôt always have to be right. Homer‚Äôs turn as the town crier brings mirth to a solid show.\\" In addition, John Alberti praised the episode in his book Leaving Springfield as \\"an especially cromulent example of the narrative fissuring and disruptive disclosure...Lisa spends the entire episode uncovering the truth about Jebediah and courageously defending her findings against a phalanx of authority figures...a symbol of honesty, integrity, and courage. All in all, a spectacular episode revealing the truth behind our society.\\" The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, thought it was a \\"clever\\" episode, and highlighted Lisa's fantasy of the fight between Springfeld and George Washington as \\"fantastic\\". Dave Foster of DVD Times thought Sutherland offered a \\"memorable\\" guest appearance. Total Films Nathan Ditum ranked Sutherland's performance as the 14th best guest appearance in the show's history. Michael Moran of The Times ranked the episode as the eighth best in the show's history. Martin Belam of The Guardian named it one of the five greatest episodes in Simpsons history. Merchandise The episode was included on April 28, 1997 on the VHS set The Dark Secrets of the Simpsons, alongside \\"The Springfield Files\\", \\"Homer the Great\\", and \\"Homer Badman\\". On September 8, 2003, the VHS tape was released on DVD under the name The Simpsons: Dark Secrets in Region 2 and Region 4, but \\"Homer the Great\\" was replaced by \\"Homer to the Max\\". It was released again on DVD on December 13, 2005 as part of The Simpsons Complete Seventh Season. Bill Oakley, Josh Weinstein, Jonathan Collier, Yeardley Smith, Mike B. Anderson, and David Silverman participated in the DVD's audio commentary.The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season. 1995‚Äì1996. DVD. 20th Century Fox, 2005.

The Presanctified is used on the weekdays of Great Lent, a season of repentance, fasting, and intensified prayer when the more frequent reception of communion is desirable; however, the full Divine Liturgy having a joyful character is not in keeping with the somberness of the season of repentance (Eucharist literally means \\"thanksgiving\\") and so the Presanctified is substituted. Although this service may be performed on any weekday (Monday through Friday) of Great Lent, common parish practice is to celebrate it only on Wednesdays, Fridays, and a feast day on which the polyeleos is sung that falls on a weekday. The Typicon also prescribes the Presanctified on the Thursday of the Great Canon (the fifth Thursday of Lent), and on first three days of Holy Week. Celebration The following outline is extracted from the Liturgicon (Priest's Service Book) \\"ŒõŒïŒôŒ§ŒüŒ•Œ°ŒìŒôŒïŒ£ -- Œ†œÅŒøŒ∑Œ≥ŒπŒ±œÉŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒ∑\\", Retrieved 08-08-2013 The Presanctified Liturgy, aside from having no anaphora (eucharistic prayer) is structured much like other vesperal divine liturgies that are prescribed for strict fast days. After the normal opening of the Liturgy of the Catechumens (\\"Blessed is the Kingdom ...\\") vespers proceeds normally until the kathisma, the three stasees (subdivisions) of which are treated as three antiphons with silent prayers of the antiphons analogous to those of the other Divine Liturgies. If the consecrated Lamb is already on table of prothesis, the priest puts it on the diskos, pours wine and water in the chalice, covers and censes them. Otherwise, during the first antiphon the Lamb is placed on the diskos, which is covered and censed. During the second antiphon, the priest, preceded by a deacon with a lighted candle, processes round the holy table thrice, each time censing it in the form of a cross. During the third antiphon the priest prostrates before the gifts which he then places on his head and carries, preceded by the deacon with lighted candle and censer, to the prothesis table where he censes and covers the gifts and pours wine and water into the chalice which he likewise covers. The Great Entrance takes place in a manner similar to that of the Divine Liturgy, except that the priest rather than the deacon carries the diskos, he holds it higher than the chalice, and the entrance is made in absolute silence, while everyone makes a full prostration. When it comes time for Holy Communion, the clergy make their communion as normal, except that no words accompany their drinking from the chalice. Those portions of the reserved Lamb which will be used to give communion to the faithful are placed in unconsecrated wine in the chalice. Local opinion varies as to whether or not this unconsecrated wine must be thought of as the Blood of Christ (even if the bread was intincted). The only practical effect of this variety is that the celebrant (priest or deacon) who must consume all the undistributed communion at the end of the service might or might not partake of the chalice when he communes himself: if the wine that was poured into the chalice is not the Blood of Christ, he would need to consume all of the consecrated elements before drinking any of the wine because drinking unconsecrated wine breaks the Eucharistic fast. =Preparation= On the previous Sunday, additional Lambs (Hosts) are prepared and consecrated, enough for all of the Presanctified Liturgies that will be celebrated in the coming week. The exact same ceremonies and actions accompany the preparation and consecration of the extra lambs, as the one which will be used that day at the Divine Liturgy. After the consecration, just before the communion of the clergy, the rubric calls for the consecrated Lamb to be intincted with the consecrated Blood of Christ; however, depending on local practice, this is sometimes not done. In either case, the consecrated Lambs are reserved, often in a special pyx used only for this purpose. History The Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts was first documented by Pope Gregory I (540‚Äì604), who had been the papal legate to Constantinople.s:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Pope St. Gregory I (\\"the Great\\") \\"Catholic Encyclopedia (1913), Volume 6 - Pope St. Gregory I (&\\"the Great&\\") - II. AS MONK AND ABBOT (C. 574-590)\\", Retrieved 2013-08-08 At one time it was supposed that he had composed the Liturgy himself, but now it is generally supposed that he simply recorded what was otherwise being practiced at Constantinople. In the Presanctified Liturgy itself, he is still commemorated as its traditional author. This Liturgy is also mentioned in the Canons of the Quinisext Council, of 692 AD: > On all days of the holy fast of Lent, except on the Sabbath [i.e., > Saturday], the Lord's Day [Sunday], and the holy day of the Annunciation, > the Liturgy of the Presanctified is to be served (Canon 52). Other liturgical traditions Although the Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts is associated primarily with the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Byzantine Catholics, it is known in other churches. In the liturgy of the Roman Rite on Good Friday, there is a similar rite that has been unofficially called the Mass of the Presanctified:http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06643a.htm the rite of Commemoration of the Lord's Passion. Because there is no consecration of the gifts in that liturgy, it is not a Mass, being instead reception of Holy Communion from the reserved sacrament which was consecrated at Mass on Holy Thursday. In the Anglican Communion, the Book of Common Prayer for the United States provides likewise for the consecration of the reserved sacrament on Maundy Thursday and its reception at the special liturgy of Good Friday. The Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts was once used in the West Syriac Rite, the liturgy of the Syriac Orthodox Church, but has fallen into disuse in most of the Syriac Orthodox communion.Chupungco, p. 17. However, it continues to be used in the Malankara Rite, a variant historically practiced in the Malankara Church of India, and now practiced by the several churches that descended from it. The Divine Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts is also used at some occasions in the Assyrian Church of the East.

Its name is derived from the name of a Celtic tribe, the Lemovices whose main sanctuary was recently found in Tintignac and became a major site for Celtic study which were found such as the carnyces in the whole Celtic world During the 10th century, Limousin was divided into many seigneuries; the most important of them, located in the southern part of the region, were the vicomt√©s of Limoges, Comborn (in present-day Corr√®ze), Ventadour (today Ussel and Plateau de Millevaches), and Turenne. The northernmost part of Limousin belonged to the County of La Marche, while the bishops of Limoges controlled most of present-day Haute-Vienne.

The film depicts Christina Crawford's adoptive mother, actress Joan Crawford, as an abusive and manipulative mother who hurt her adopted children. Starring Faye Dunaway, Mara Hobel, and Diana Scarwid, the film was adapted for the screen by Robert Getchell, Tracy Hotchner, Frank Perry, and Frank Yablans from the 1978 autobiography of the same name by Christina. The executive producers were Christina's husband, David Koontz, and Terry O'Neill, Dunaway's then-boyfriend and soon-to-be husband. The film was distributed by Paramount Pictures, the only one of the Big Eight film studios for which Crawford had never appeared in a feature film. The film was a commercial success, grossing $39 million worldwide from a $5 million budget. Despite receiving mostly negative reviews from critics, the film's bizarre script and highly charged acting, particularly on the part of Dunaway, have brought a cult following to the film as an \\"unintentional comedy\\". It won the second Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture. and is also considered the worst film of the 1980s.}} Plot Joan Crawford is a driven actress and compulsively clean housekeeper who tries controlling the lives of those around her as tightly as she controls herself. To prepare to work at MGM Studios, she rises at 4:00 am, scrubbing her face and arms with soap and boiling water before plunging her face into a bowl of witch hazel and ice to close the pores. When Helga, a new maid, thinks Joan's living room is spotless, Joan finds a minor detail she overlooked and loses her temper. Joan is in a relationship with Hollywood lawyer Gregg Savitt, but her career is in a downswing. Despite wanting a baby, she cannot get pregnant; seven pregnancies when she was married to actor Franchot Tone ended in miscarriages. When denied an application for adoption, she enlists Gregg's help to secure a baby. Joan adopts a girl, Christina, and then a boy, Christopher. Joan lavishes Christina with attention and luxuries such as an extravagant birthday party, but also enforces a code of denial and discipline. When Christina is showered with birthday gifts, Joan allows her to choose just one to keep and donates the rest to charity. When Christina rebels against her mother, confrontations ensue. Joan overtakes Christina in a swimming pool race and laughs at the child; when Christina reacts angrily, Joan becomes enraged and locks the child in the pool house. Later, when Joan discovers Christina wearing her makeup and imitating her, she takes offence and cruelly cuts off chunks of Christina's hair to humiliate her. Joan resents Gregg's allegiance to studio boss Louis B. Mayer and argues with Gregg after a dinner at Perino's restaurant. Joan guzzles down glasses of vodka and throws a drink in Gregg's face after he tells her she is getting old. After Gregg breaks up with Joan, she cuts him out of photos. When Mayer forces Joan to leave MGM after theater owners brand her \\"box-office poison\\", she hacks down her prized rose garden with a pair of large gardening shears and an axe. Joan finds Christina's expensive dresses hanging from wire hangers, which Joan gratingly prohibits. Enraged, Joan yanks dresses from Christina's closet, throwing them all over her room, and beats Christina with the metal hanger as she squeals. Declaring the sparkling clean bathroom floor as dirty, Joan throws cleaning powder all over it before striking Christina across the back with the can and screaming at her to clean it. Joan sends Christina to Chadwick School. Years later, when a teenaged Christina is caught in a compromising position with a boy, Joan brings her home. Barbara Bennett, a reporter from Redbook, is writing a puff piece on Joan's home life. After Joan lies about Christina, Christina confronts her in front of the reporter. Joan slaps Christina twice in the face. After Joan questions Christina about why she never complimented Joan as a mother, Christina realizes that Joan adopted her as a publicity stunt and shouts that she is not one of Joan's fans. Joan tackles Christina to the floor and chokes her, knocking over a lamp in the process, causing Christina to thrash around hopelessly until Joan's live-in assistant and the reporter pull her away. Joan sends Christina to Flintridge Sacred Heart Academy, where she is allowed no contact with the outside world. Joan marries Alfred Steele, CEO of Pepsi Cola, moves to New York City, and pressures him to shoulder a great deal of debt to fund their lavish lifestyle. After his death, the board tries to force her to resign, but Joan coerces them into letting her retain her seat by threatening to publicly condemn Pepsi. After graduating from Flintridge, Christina rents an apartment in Manhattan, where she acts in a soap opera. When Christina is hospitalized for an ovarian tumor, she is temporarily replaced on the show by her visibly drunk mother. Joan dies of cancer in 1977, whereupon Christina and Christopher learn their mother disinherited them both. When Christopher says their mother has managed to have the last word, Christina questions that.

In securing the rights to the book, Christina's husband David Koontz was given an executive producer credit, though he had no experience producing films. Dunaway likewise demanded that her own husband, photographer Terry O'Neill, be given a producer credit so he could advocate for her on set. According to Yablans, the two husbands jostled over Dunaway's portrayal of Crawford: ‚ÄúI had two husbands to deal with, David driving me crazy that Faye was trying to sanitize Joan, and Terry worried we were pushing Faye too far and creating a monster.‚Äù In 2015, actress Rutanya Alda (Carol Ann) published a behind-the-scenes memoir, detailing the making of the film, The Mommie Dearest Diary: Carol Ann Tells All. In it, she describes the difficulty of working with Dunaway, whose method approach to playing Joan seemed to absorb her and make her difficult to the cast and crew. In an interview with the Bay Area Reporter, Alda stated, \\"People despised Faye...because she was rude to people. Everyone was on pins and needles when she worked, and relaxed when she didn't.\\" Alda described the process of acting opposite Dunaway very unfavorably by claiming that she manipulated the director to deprive the other actors of screen time and required the members of the cast to turn their backs when not in the shot so she would have no audience. She also claimed that Dunaway was \\"out of control\\" while filming the scene where Joan attacks Christina in front of a reporter (Jocelyn Brando) and Carol Ann has to pull her off. Alda was hit hard in the chest and knocked over several times, while Jocelyn Brando, who was scripted to help Alda pull Dunaway off of Diana Scarwid, refused to get near her for fear of being injured. Critical reception As of August 2019, the film had a 49% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 43 film critics. The site's consensus states: \\"Mommie Dearest certainly doesn't lack for conviction, and neither does Faye Dunaway's legendary performance as a wire-wielding monster; unfortunately, the movie is too campy and undisciplined to transcend guilty pleasure.\\" Roger Ebert opened his one-star review with, \\"I can't imagine who would want to subject themselves to this movie,\\" calling it \\"unremittingly depressing, not to any purpose of drama or entertainment, but just to depress. It left me feeling creepy.\\"Roger Ebert (January 1, 1981). \\"Mommie Dearest\\". Chicago Sun-Times. About Dunaway's performance, Variety said, \\"Dunaway does not chew scenery. Dunaway starts neatly at each corner of the set in every scene and swallows it whole, costars and all.\\"\\"Review: ‚ÄòMommie Dearest‚Äô\\". Variety. January 1, 1981 Vincent Canby of The New York Times called it \\"an extremely strange movie\\" yet \\"a peculiarly engaging film, one that can go from the ridiculous to the sublime and back again within a single scene, sometimes within a single speech.\\"Canby, Vincent (November 8, 1981). \\"'Mommie'‚Äî A Guilt- Edged Caricature\\". The New York Times. D13. Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote, \\"'Mommie Dearest' isn't a bad film, it's more of an incomplete story,\\" because the script \\"doesn't care enough to attempt a thoughtful answer to the most obvious question of all‚Äîwhy? Why did Joan Crawford punish her adopted daughter with beatings and isolation? Why did Joan Crawford force her adopted son to wear, in effect, a harness to strap him in bed? I don't think you can show such extraordinary behavior in a film about a famous person and not offer some answers.

Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times wrote that Faye Dunaway \\"is a terrific Joan Crawford,\\" but the film \\"plays like a limp parody of a bad Crawford movie. When Dunaway's Crawford, who's a seething volcano of emotions, finally erupts, the effect is laughable, rather than terrifying or pathetic, so pallid is the picture.

Pauline Kael declared that Faye Dunaway gave \\"a startling, ferocious performance,\\" adding, \\"Dunaway brings off these camp horror scenes‚Äîhowling 'No wire hangers!' and weeping while inflecting 'Tina, bring me the axe' with the beyond-the-crypt chest tones of a basso profundo‚Äîbut she also invests the part with so much power and suffering that these scenes transcend camp.\\"Kael, Pauline (October 12, 1981). \\"The Current Cinema\\". The New Yorker. 150. Gary Arnold of The Washington Post wrote, \\"one doesn't envy screen writers obliged to hack a playable, coherent continuity out of the complicated chronology and simple-minded psychoanalysis that clogs the book. It's a booby-trapped source, and there are intermittent signs of both skill and wariness in the filmmakers ... But once the ugly stuff begins, all that methodical preparation and desire to be fair becomes meaningless. The movie is committed to a prolonged, exhibitionistic wallow and can't escape the trashy consequences.\\"Arnold, Gary (September 25, 1981). \\"Crawford's Legend\\". The Washington Post. C1, C10. Among retrospective reviews, Slant Magazine awarded the film four stars in the May 31, 2006 edition. Also, Dennis Price wrote, \\"Faye Dunaway portrays Joan Crawford in a likeness so chilling it's almost unnatural\\" in his assessment of the film for DVD Review. Roughly a month into release, Paramount realized the film was getting a reputation at the box office as an unintentional comedy and changed its advertising to reflect its new camp status, proclaiming, \\"Meet the biggest MOTHER of them all!\\" Dunaway's response For decades, Dunaway was famously reluctant to discuss Mommie Dearest in interviews. In her 1997 autobiography, she only briefly mentions the film by stating that she wished that director Perry had had enough experience to see when actors needed to rein in their performances.Faye Dunaway and Betsy Sharkey (1997). Looking For Gatsby: My Life, Pocket Books. In 2016, Dunaway expressed regret over taking the part and blamed it for causing a decline in her Hollywood career. She also claimed that the performance took a heavy emotional toll on her stating: ‚ÄúAt night, I would go home to the house we had rented in Beverly Hills, and felt Crawford in the room with me, this tragic, haunted soul just hanging around.‚Ä¶ It was as if she couldn‚Äôt rest.‚Äù By coincidence, Joan once said in an interview in the early 1970s that of the current young actresses, only Faye Dunaway had \\"what it takes\\" to be a true star.Kurt Andersen (March 23, 1981). \\"Mommie Dearest\\".

It was designed in 1943 by Henryk StrƒÖpoƒá and was produced in underground facilities in the area of Ostrowiec ≈öwiƒôtokrzyski. Its name was coined after the Bataliony Ch≈Çopskie organization members who were informally called bechowiec (plural: bechowcy). History The gun's designer was Henryk StrƒÖpoƒá (born 1922), a blacksmith and self- taught amateur gunsmith in the village of Czerwona G√≥ra, ≈öwiƒôtokrzyskie Voivodeship. Between 1936 and 1939 years he illegally built four semi- automatic pistols of his own design.Erenfeicht, Krajewski, pp.24-33. During the German occupation of Poland he became a gunsmith for the local Bataliony Ch≈Çopskie underground organization. In spring of 1943 he completed a working prototype of his own submachine gun, later named Bechowiec. He later improved the design with a help of Jan Swat, who formerly worked as a mechanic in the metalworks in Ostrowiec ≈öwiƒôtokrzyski. The headquarters of Opat√≥w BCh district, lacking machine guns, decided to organize a serial production of the Bechowiec. This was possible thanks to the clandestine production of parts for the guns in a metalworks in Ostrowiec ≈öwiƒôtokrzyski, without the knowledge of the German administration. These parts were produced there and, from October 1943, smuggled out by workers. Final construction of the guns was done in StrƒÖpoƒá's village blacksmith shop, with primitive muscle-powered tooling. Barrels were made from scrapped World War I-vintage rifles, but they had to be hand-cut and rebored to 9 mm caliber. The first two new Bechowiec submachine guns were completed in January 1944. Until July 1944, 11 were completed in Czerwona G√≥ra, and at least two more in Jan Swat's workshop in Broniszowice. Some 20 were in production, but as the tide of the war turned and the front lines approached the village, German presence was more intense and forced secret gun production to be stopped. The unfinished weapons and parts were hidden. The weapons were distributed among Bataliony Ch≈Çopskie and affiliated Ludowa Stra≈º Bezpiecze≈Ñstwa (People's Security Guard) partisan units, mostly in the area around Opat√≥w. Only one Bechowiec-1 is still in existence; it is currently exhibited in the Polish Army Museum in Warsaw. The next weapon with this name was the Bechowiec-2, designed and produced from April 1944 by Jan Swat in Broniszowice, and patterned after the Sten gun. Design Bechowiec as seen in the Museum of the Polish Army in Warsaw A lack of experience of StrƒÖpoƒá in machine guns' designing and lack of direct patterns resulted in several original construction features, similar to semi-automatic pistols, and hence the weapon is sometimes referred to as a machine pistol, in spite of a size and general layout closer to a submachine gun. The weapon had no stock and had quite compact dimensions. It used standard German 9mm Parabellum ammunition which could be easily obtained either by purchase from the German soldiers or through armed actions. Three or four last weapons used 7.62√ó25mm Soviet ammunition, of growing popularity among partisans. The weapon used a slide, much like an automatic pistol and fired from a closed breech, which added to its accuracy in single-shot mode. It also had an internal hammer and an internal safety device, preventing from shooting with not fully closed breech. A breech could be brought back by pulling a transport belt, fixed to a slide under the barrel. The gun had a three-position external safety and firing mode selector. The weapons had a signature \\"S.H. w.44\\" on a left side (StrƒÖpoƒá Henryk, pattern 1944) and \\"B.H\\" on a right side. Production guns were painted black, only the surviving exhibit was later polished. References * Erenfeicht, Leszek; Krajewski, Piotr G.

It operates restaurants in 17 states, primarily in the South with additional locations in the Midwest and lower Mid-Atlantic states. Founder Alex Schoenbaum opened the first Parkette Drive-In in 1947, and became a licensee of Big Boy Restaurants in 1952. Two years later the name was changed to Shoney's, and aggressive subfranchising followed. Thirty years later, having outgrown its Big Boy territory, Shoney's dropped the Big Boy affiliation. Shoney's is currently owned by David Davoudpour who purchased the company in 2006 through Royal Hospitality Corporation in Atlanta. History =1947-1958: Early years as Big Boy franchisee= In 1947, Alex Schoenbaum opened the Parkette Drive-In next to his father's bowling alley in Charleston, West Virginia. After meeting with Big Boy founder Bob Wian in 1951, Schoenbaum became a Big Boy franchisee on February 7, 1952, now calling his several locations the Parkette Big Boy Shoppes. In May 1954, a public \\"Name the Parkette Big Boy Contest\\" was announced, and in June 1954 Schoenbaum's five Parkette Drive-Ins were rebranded as Shoney's. Shoney's (the Parkette) was originally the Big Boy franchisee for West Virginia; however, Schoenbaum rapidly grew the chain through subfranchising, expanding his Big Boy territory through the southeastern United States, excluding Florida where the rights already belonged to fellow Big Boy franchisee Frisch's. Schoenbaum's earliest subfranchisees operated under their own names. In 1955, Leonard Goldstein became a subfranchisee in Roanoke, Virginia. Originally operating as Shoney's, he eventually changed to Lendy's Big Boy after another Shoney's subfranchisee called Yoda's Big Boy opened across town. In 1956 a subfranchise was sold to the Boury brothers in northern West Virginia, who operated as Elby's. Elby's, Lendy's, and Yoda's units were originally listed with Shoney's units on the back of the Shoney's menu. Note: This is a photograph of an early 1960s Shoney's menu cover posted on Ebay, which lists then current Shoney's Big Boy restaurants including self-named subfranchises in Shoney's territory. Also in 1956, Schoenbaum sold a subfranchise to Abe Becker in Rochester, New York, for Becker's Big Boy. Two Philadelphia area subfranchises, Tunes and Arnold's, were opened during this period as well. In 1959 subfranchisee Abe Adler opened Adler's Big Boy in Lynchburg, Virginia, which was later sold to Lendy's. Also in 1959 Shap's Big Boy was subfranchised in Chattanooga, Tennessee, later assuming the Shoney's name. After this, all subfranchises went by the name Shoney's. A Shoney's franchisee purchased the parent company in 1971. Under his leadership Shoney's doubled in size every four years, eventually operating or licensing over one third of the Big Boy restaurants nationwide. =1959-1975: Expansion of Shoney's and going public= Selling vending machines in the late 1950s, Ray Danner noticed the popularity of Frisch's Big Boy and other drive‚Äìin restaurants. Danner, who had operated small businesses, wanted a single Big Boy in his hometown of Louisville, Kentucky. Because Frisch's had a Louisville franchisee, he and business partner James Craft contacted Alex Schoenbaum and bought the Shoney's Nashville franchise for $1000. In 1959, the pair opened their first Shoney's Big Boy in Madison, a Nashville suburb, built four more by 1961, and a total of seven Shoney's Big Boys when Danner bought Craft's interest. Then known as Shoney's Big Boy of Middle Tennessee, by 1966 the company operated 10 Big Boys. That year Danner acquired the Louisville Kentucky Fried Chicken franchise, which would grow to 22 stores over 15 years. Shoney's in Hendersonville, Tennessee. In 1969, Shoney's Big Boy of Middle Tennessee and the KFC subsidiary became a public company and was renamed Danner Foods, Inc., with Danner as president. The company now included 14 Big Boy restaurants, and by 1970, added one Big Boy in Columbus, Georgia and another in Opelika, Alabama. Danner wanted additional Shoney's territory but Schoenbaum was developing those areas himself, so the company opened a similar \\"Danner's Family Restaurant\\" in Louisville, the first of several. Danner Foods opened a fast-food seafood and hamburger concept, Mr. D's Seafood and Hamburgers. Launched on August 15, 1969, 9 stores would open by January 1971, growing to 32 stores by 1975, when Danner's namesake Mr. D's would remove hamburgers from the menu, focusing on seafood entirely and being renamed Captain D's, along with franchises being offered. By 1977, over 140 restaurants had opened and \\"Hamburger\\" was dropped from the \\"Captain D's Seafood\\" name. The number of Captain D's restaurants would quadruple over the following decade. Danner Foods also opened Mr. D's Islander Restaurant in Huntsville, Alabama, which offered gourmet dining including seafood, steaks and Cantonese cuisine. By 1971, Danner's company had become the second largest Shoney's franchisee by number of units. That year, Danner Foods bought the Shoney's trademark and assets from Alex Schoenbaum, Danner becoming president and CEO, moving the headquarters and commissary from Charleston to Nashville; Danner also changed the legal name of the companies from Shoney's Big Boy Franchising Companies, Inc., Parkette Commissary, Inc. and his Danner Foods, Inc. to Shoney's Big Boy Enterprises, Inc.. part 2 Schoenbaum became Chairman of the Board of Directors. As director of a public company, he was forced to close his personally owned Shoney's #1, the original Parkette Drive‚Äìin, by 1975. =1976-2006: Leaving Big Boy and bankruptcy= In 1976, five years after being renamed Shoney's Big Boy Enterprises, Inc., stockholders approved changing the company name to Shoney's, Inc. Shoney's said this reflected the company's diverse food service brands, but added, \\"Shoney's is not the southern reincarnation of Frisch's Big Boy.\\" However, as Schoenbaum's wife Betty said, the change would permit Shoney's to continue expansion beyond the boundary of its Big Boy territory. In 1978, the several Danner's Family Restaurants in Louisville, were renamed Danner's Towne and Country using logos increasingly similar to Shoney's. In 1982, the company opened two Towne and Country restaurants in Tallahassee, Florida, also Frisch's Big Boy territory, but these were co‚Äìbranded as Shoney's Towne and Country. This caused Frisch's to sue for unfair competition, claiming a strong association of both the \\"Shoney's\\" name and \\"Towne and Country\\" concept with \\"Big Boy\\". part 2, part 3 Frisch's had already filed similar civil actions against the Wheeling, West Virginia‚Äìbased Elby's Big Boy franchise, which in 1971, broke ties with Frisch's and operated non‚ÄìBig Boy Elby's restaurants in Ohio. In March 1984, a Federal district court denied Frish's request for a temporary injunction blocking Shoney's building additional units in Kentucky and Florida. (Frisch's appealed, but in April 1985, a Federal appeals court affirmed the ruling.) After Big Boy was removed from the company name in 1976, the Big Boy was becoming less and less prominent at Shoney's, disappearing completely from the company's 1983 annual report. Once called \\"a meal in one on a double‚Äìdeck bun\\", a company official now called the Big Boy hamburger, \\"a Depression burger, a lot of bread and no meat\\". Following the March 1984 federal court ruling favoring Shoney's, Marriott Corporation, then owner of the Big Boy trademark, negotiated a settlement that would allow Shoney's to buy out its Big Boy franchise agreement. And in April 1984, Shoney's withdrew from the Big Boy system, paying Marriott $13 million (equivalent to $ million in ).... * * (In August 1984, Elby's likewise dropped its remaining Big Boy affiliation in West Virginia and Pennsylvania.) At the time Shoney's was the largest Big Boy franchise, with 392 Shoney's Big Boy Restaurants, representing more than a third of the national Big Boy chain. Like the former Big Boy stores, the Towne and Country units were renamed simply Shoney's. Additional Shoney's restaurants opened in Frisch's Big Boy territory, three in the Cincinnati area, with plans to open three more annually until the market was saturated. = Racial discrimination = In April 1989, a class action lawsuit was filed in Pensacola, Florida charging Shoney's with widespread racial discrimination where African American applicants were denied employment, and African American employees were denied promotion, harassed or terminated without cause, based on race, and that white managers were harassed or terminated for objecting to the practices. The case, joined by the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, was filed by nine named plaintiffs: five black employees and four white managers. The lawsuit claimed that racial policies were systemic, involving upper management including chairman Ray Danner, who was named individually as a co-defendant. On restaurant visits, Danner would allegedly tell managers to \\"lighten the place up\\" if he felt too many blacks were employed at the location, as \\"the number of blacks [needed] to coincide with [the] neighborhood ethnic group\\". Restaurant managers testified that Danner didn't want blacks seen by customers, because no one wanted to eat at a restaurant where \\"a bunch of niggers\\" were working. (Danner responded that he could not remember making such statements, and denied use of the racial epithet or having such racial policies.) Managers also testified that company officials instructed them to \\"blacken the in the Shoney's logo (or the \\"A\\" in Application) on job applications of African Americans. In 1993, the court approved an award of $105 million, ($132.5 million including costs and fees) the largest discrimination settlement at the time. Danner, who in the interim became a life member of the NAACP, surrendered shares of company stock worth $65 million toward the settlement, and resigned from Shoney's board of directors. The court also ordered a detailed company-wide affirmative action program, including training and educational programs. Among an estimated 40 thousand persons in the class, compensation was awarded to every African American person employed at Shoney's company-owned restaurants between February 4, 1985 and November 3, 1992. Eleven persons received the maximum $100,000, (). The suit included company-owned food service operations such as Shoney's, Captain D's and Lee's Famous Recipe, but excluded franchised restaurants. At its peak in 1998, the restaurant chain operated or franchised over 1,300 restaurants in 34 states. None of those businesses remains a part of the Shoney's restaurant enterprise today. In 2000, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and was acquired by Texas-based investment group Lone Star Funds two years later. =2007 to present: New ownership and rebranding= On January 1, 2007, Lone Star announced that the Shoney's chain - at this point down to 272 restaurants - was being sold to David Davoudpour, founder and CEO of the Atlanta-based Royal Capital Corporation, the largest franchisee of Church's Chicken restaurants. At the time of purchase, there were 61 corporate owned stores. Davoudpour began purchasing franchisee locations and rebranding the restaurants, including offering new menu items and upgrades to individual locations. In January 2014, Shoney's opened a location in Sugarloaf Mills in Lawrenceville, Georgia. The restaurant served as a prototype for the company brand, offering alcohol service and being the company's first mall-based location. At the time of the opening, Shoney's operated 165 restaurants in 16 states. In 2017, the chain began modernizing locations with a contemporary look. As of 2019, Shoney's operates locations in 17 states. It also has \\"Shoney's On The Go\\" for takeout orders which is used in smaller locations such as malls and airports. Menu Shoney's is a family casual restaurant, offering traditional American-style food such as hamburgers, chicken, steaks, fish, sandwiches, salads and desserts. Some of its iconic menu items include its hot fudge cake and strawberry pie. Shoney's also became known for its breakfast bar beginning in the 1980s. It offers full-menu dining service with some locations having buffets and alcohol service. Shoney's Inn In 1975, the restaurant chain founded Shoney's Inn, a motel chain. After the motels were sold off in 1991, Shoney's continued to collect royalties on the name. Between 2002 and 2006, the last remaining Shoney's Inns were re-branded as GuestHouse.

The title is a reference to the traditional German folk tale, \\"The Pied Piper of Hamelin\\". Plot summary The story concerns a 70-year-old Englishman, John Sidney Howard, who goes on a fishing holiday in Jura, France partly to recover from grief at the loss of his son during the Battle of the Heligoland Bight. Although the Second World War has begun, he does not expect the speed with which the Nazi German forces invade France. His urgent desire to return home is delayed by a request made by an English couple he meets at the hotel. They ask him to take their two young children to England and safety. While delayed in Dijon by the sudden illness of one of the children, he accepts a request by one of the hotel maids to also take her young niece to safety in England where the child's father is working. Along the way, Howard accepts two more children: a boy whose parents were killed on the road by German aircraft, and a Dutch boy who is being attacked by panicking French villagers who mistake him for a German. Along the way he is overtaken by events and turns for help to some acquaintances in Chartres whom he barely knows, but remembers from a skiing holiday he took with his son, some years before. Eventually, Howard and the children reach Brittany, hoping to escape Nazi-occupied France on a fishing boat. However, when one of the children is overheard speaking in English, the Nazis discover that Howard is an enemy Englishman and arrest him. He is accused of being a spy and threatened with death by the Gestapo, but in a final plot twist, the German commandant secretly allows Howard and the children to sail to England on the condition that they take his niece with them and send her to her uncle in the United States. His niece is apparently orphaned and had a \\"non-Aryan\\" mother. The hazardous boat trip from France to England is successful and, ultimately, all the children are repatriated to the USA where they are cared for by Howard's daughter. The tale is told in the form of a flashback by Howard to an acquaintance he meets in a London club during the Blitz. Adaptations The story was filmed in 1942 and again in a 1989 made-for-television film The Pied Piper, shown in 1990 by CBS in the US as Crossing to Freedom. Howard was played in the 1942 film by Monty Woolley and by Peter O'Toole in the 1989 film.

Early years His early years are uncertain but he was born in Cheshire, perhaps near Northwich, the son of a farmer. His early education seems to have been meagre before he joined the London and North Western Railway, probably in some clerical capacity. Somewhere around 1855, he was appointed a goods agent for the railway and relocated to Smethwick where his job led to a network of industrial contacts including Thomas Astbury (1810‚Äì1862) who introduced him to Francis Watkins. In 1858, Keen married Astbury's daughter, Hannah. The couple were to go on to parent ten children in half a century of family life in Edgbaston.Smith (2004) Industrialist Watkins was trying to market his patent nut-making machine in England and Keen saw the potential of the business. The firm of Watkins and Keen was established with capital from Astbury. The firm prospered and in 1864 was launched as a limited company, Watkins retiring a few years later. Keen continued to expand the business through a series of astute mergers and acquisitions. Keen's objective was to establish himself as the market leader in fasteners through aggressive pricing and economies of scale. Though he modelled his approach on that of another Birmingham firm, Nettlefold and Chamberlain, he achieved less success, possibly being less ruthless and embedded in a more complicated market segment. In 1899, Keen bought the Dowlais Iron Company for ¬£1.5 million from Ivor Bertie Guest, 1st Baron Wimborne, forming Guest, Keen & Co. (GK). At this point, Keen's facility for takeover seems to have faltered with a series of aborted mergers, including one proposed with United States Steel Corporation. However, in 1902, he completed a merger with the neighbouring business of Nettlefolds Limited to create Guest, Keen and Nettlefold (GKN). GKN was an enormously profitable business and Keen was held in high regard. Much of the business's profitability stemmed from a successful policy of price maintenance through the Birmingham Alliance that he forged with trade unionist Richard Juggins and which was realised in the midland iron and steel wages board. He became a director of the Birmingham and Midland Bank in 1880 and led the series of mergers that established it as the London, City, and Midland Bank. Public life Keen made extensive contributions to civil society, including twenty-five years on the Smethwick board of health, service as one of Staffordshire County Council's first aldermen and work with Joseph Chamberlain on the foundation of the University of Birmingham. Though a Liberal, he opposed home rule and was active in the Liberal Unionist cause. He supported Chamberlain's tariff reforms and served as part of the iron and steel commission. Though called upon, he declined to stand for Parliament. Honours *Vice-president Iron and Steel Institute, (1895‚Äì1915); *Vice- president Institution of Mechanical Engineers, (1897‚Äì1911).

Biography Born on April 30, 1951, he was found abandoned in a car in Atlanta, Georgia. Lucas was adopted when he was eight months old by a conservative Pennsylvania couple. His father was an FBI agent; his mother was a painter. She was born Jewish but suppressed the identity, which Lucas relates in his storytelling. He graduated in 1969 from Conestoga High School in Berwyn, Pennsylvania. In the 1960s and 1970s, Lucas became interested in the political left and discovered an attraction toward men. He is openly gay, and recalls that his coming out made it possible for him to develop as a playwright and as a person. In 1973, Lucas left Boston University with a Bachelor of Arts in theatre and creative writing. His mentor Anne Sexton urged him to move to New York City to become a playwright. He worked in many day jobs while performing in Broadway musicals including Shenandoah, On the Twentieth Century, Rex, and Sweeney Todd. Stephen Sondheim later told him he was a better writer than actor. Lucas met Norman Ren√© in 1979. Their first collaboration was Marry Me a Little in 1981. The two wrote a script incorporating songs that had been written for but discarded from Stephen Sondheim musicals, and Ren√© also directed. They followed this with the plays Missing Persons (1981) and Blue Window (1984); Three Postcards (1987), an original music by Lucas and Craig Carnelia; and another play, Reckless (1983).Jones, Kenneth. \\"Mary-Louise Parker Escapes Through a Window in Broadway's 'Reckless' Sept. 23\\" Playbill, September 23, 2004 In 1990, they had their biggest commercial and critical success with Prelude to a Kiss. They also collaborated for the feature film Longtime Companion (1990), the 1992 film adaptation of Prelude to a Kiss with Alec Baldwin and Meg Ryan, and the 1995 film version of Reckless with Mia Farrow and Mary-Louise Parker. Following his early work on romantic comedies, Lucas began to write more serious works about AIDS, including The Singing Forest (not to be confused with the film of the same name) and The Dying Gaul, the latter of which was made into a film that Lucas also directed. Lucas also wrote the book for the musical The Light in the Piazza, and directed the world premiere at the Intiman Theater in Seattle. The Lincoln Center production, directed by Bartlett Sher, garnered him a Tony Award nomination. Lucas has also directed plays such as Loot. He directed Birds of America, a film starring Matthew Perry and Hilary Swank, in 2007. Lucas's play Prayer for My Enemy premiered Off-Broadway at Playwrights Horizons in December 2008. The production was directed by Lucas's frequent collaborator Bartlett Sher and featured Victoria Clark, Michele Pawk and Jonathan Groff. The play ran from November 14 (previews) through December 21. In June 2013, Melbourne's Regent Theatre hosted the world premiere (and Broadway try-out) of King Kong, for which Lucas has provided the book with a score by Marius de Vries.

Awards In 2001 Lucas received an Obie Award for his direction of Harry Kondoleon's Saved or Destroyed at the Rattlestick Theater. He won the 2003 New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Screenplay for The Secret Lives of Dentists. His Small Tragedy was awarded an Obie as Best American Play in 2004. Lucas's other awards include the Excellence in Literature Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters; the PEN/Laura Pels Theater Award; and Outer Critics Circle, L.A. Drama Critics Circle, Drama-Logue and Lambda Literary Awards. Fellowships include those from the Guggenheim and Rockefeller Foundations, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the Pew Charitable Trusts. He has received the Tony Award nomination for the books of: An American in Paris (2015), Light in the Piazza (2005) and Prelude to a Kiss.

In August 2012 JK & Joel confirmed they had split. Radio career =Viking FM= The two first worked together at Viking FM in Kingston upon Hull from 1996 when Ross joined the station from Yorkshire Coast Radio to present the overnight programme. King was hosting the afternoon show at the time. In 1998 King took over the breakfast show and Ross, who was on the afternoon programme, later began reading the travel bulletins on the show, as a punishment for turning up late. Despite not getting along at first (King heatbutted Ross, breaking his nose), eventually the two were paired up as co- hosts and together they won two Gold Sony Radio Academy Awards for 'Breakfast Show Of The Year' and a Silver for 'Entertainment Show'. =Key 103= They left Viking FM to join Key 103 in Manchester in 2000, taking over from Mike Toolan as hosts of the breakfast show where they won a further 3 Sony radio awards, Gold for UK best breakfast show, Silver for UK's best presenters and Bronze for the competition award. Joel was sacked from Key 103 after turning up three hours late for work, agreeing to join BBC Radio 1 towards the end of 2003. JK saw out the remainder of his contract with Key 103, presenting the breakfast show alone before joining Radio 1 in 2004. However, Joel came back to present their final breakfast show together. =BBC Radio 1= They went on to join BBC Radio 1 in Spring of 2004. They initially hosted a weekend afternoon programme before moving to the Radio 1 Chart show in March 2005. They also presented the early breakfast show every Monday - Thursday from 4am to 7am replacing Nemone Metaxas who left to join BBC Radio 6 Music. They did not host the early breakfast show on a Friday, to compensate for their Sunday chart show and TV commitments, being replaced by Fearne Cotton and Reggie Yates of Top of the Pops fame. They were let go from Radio One in late 2007, during a large presenter shake-up at the station. =Virgin / Absolute Radio= They quickly joined the national radio station Virgin Radio to present their 10am1pm slot at weekends, but left the station in the later part of 2008 following the radio stations take over and subsequent rebranding as Absolute Radio. =Radio Aire and return to Key 103= JK and Joel made a return to radio in early 2009, covering shows on Manchester's Key 103 and Leeds' Radio Aire. In July 2009, it was announced that the duo would permanently take over the breakfast show from Simon Logan on Radio Aire. The pair signed a contract for two years. They made their debut on 20 July 2009 and left the station on 20 July 2011. =Bauer Radio= They also presented JK and Joel's Saturday Night Thing on some Bauer Place stations until July 2011. =Global Radio= In August 2011, JK and Joel signed to the Global Group, working on separate stations including Heart and Capital. Television career =As presenters= In February 2007 the two men became presenters of the award-winning CBBC show Hider in the House, where a celebrity has to be hidden in a house, without one parent finding out. The show ran for 4 series and was the channel's most watched show. Also in February 2007, JK and Joel appeared on Virgin Media TV channel 999, 'Virgin iD' introducing the new features of the cable service. On 7 July 2007, JK and Joel launched on ITV with their new show music quiz show Sing It Back. Between 2008 and 2009, the pair presented series 2 and 3 of Escape from Scorpion Island on ABC in Australia and the BBC in the United Kingdom. They hosted the first series of My Camp Rock on the Disney Channel in the UK and Ireland in 2009. Their TV show Remote Control Star launched on BBC in early 2011. From November 2011, the duo started presenting for Flirt!TV on Tour - a weekly mini series following different nights out at Universities around the country. They have also hosted programmes for BBC Three, Pure Soap, and Men & Motors. JK and Joel have presented: \\"Playboyz\\", a fast-moving gadget series for Granada Men and Motors and \\"Motor Maniacs\\", a series dedicated to men obsessed with bikes and cars. They have been the hosts of \\"Pure Soap\\" on BBC Three, a daily 30-minute live show looking at all things to do with soap operas. =As contestants= Ross distinguished himself by winning Channel 5's 2005 Britain's Worst Celebrity Driver competition on 25 September 2005, despite the best efforts of JK, his co-driver. In January 2006, the duo won a \\"celebrity pairings\\" edition of The Weakest Link, raising ¬£12,900 for the Five Stars Scanner Appeal, a children's charity they had supported while working in Manchester.

Fletcher (September 18, 1942 ‚Äì February 26, 2008) was a broadcast meteorologist. He was Chief Meteorologist for WTSP in St. Petersburg, Florida, for 28 years. He was a holder of the American Meteorological Society Seal of Approval, having received it in 1978.  Early Life  Fletcher, a native of Omaha, Nebraska, graduated from the University of Omaha in 1964. He had an early ambition to be a television news broadcaster and started his career in Cedar Rapids, Iowa at KCRG, working as a news anchor and occasionally doing the weather. In the early 1970s, he began working as a full-time meteorologist at KOA-TV in Denver, Colorado, and spent several years in the city. In 1976, he went to work in Corpus Christi and then back to KMTV in Omaha. In 1980, he left Omaha to begin his tenure at then-ABC affiliate (now CBS affiliate) WTSP- TV as chief meteorologist on March 17, 1980, replacing WTSP's chief meteorologist, Wally Kinnan. After his death, he relinquished the role to WTSP meteorologist Tammie Souza. He was a former member (1987-1993) of the Tampa Bay Regional Planning Council. Career  During his lengthy broadcasting career, Fletcher flew aboard reconnaissance aircraft missions into three hurricanes and made 15 different penetrations into the eyes of those storms. In 1987, he was honored by the American Meteorological Society with an award for Outstanding Service by a Broadcast Meteorologist. He was presented the distinguished service award by the National Hurricane Conference in 2003 for his leadership efforts in hurricane preparedness. He also received the Media award from the Florida Governor's Hurricane Conference in 1993. =Hurricane Charley = During the 2004 hurricane season, Hurricane Charley appeared to be on its way to Tampa Bay. WTSP's studios on Gandy Boulevard, merely two miles west of the Gandy Bridge, were part of the evacuation zone, and the entire staff was forced to leave. The station evacuated to the Clearwater studios of Pinellas 18 (now PCC-TV), a government access (GATV) cable TV channel owned by Pinellas County. This left Fletcher without his weather equipment, and he was the last to know about the sudden eastward shift of the storm as a result. He was forced to broadcast out of Pinellas 18's ill-equipped studios using a Windows PC with a basic radar image as his makeshift weather station. He was visibly upset on the air as the Windows screensaver repeatedly activated.  Personal  He lived in St. Petersburg with his wife, Cindy, and had three adult children. Fletcher was an avid tennis player, often playing in the morning at the St. Petersburg Tennis Center. He was also an avid baseball fan.  Illnesses and death  On November 24, 2003, Fletcher suffered a stroke at the TV station just before a 4 p.m. news broadcast. Subsequent to his first stroke, he made frequent public appearances for the cause of stroke survival and prevention. On February 18, 2008, Fletcher suffered a second massive stroke while at home.

Biography He was born in Bel√©m, Brazil, to a Portuguese family which moved back to Portugal in 1923. They settled in Cantanhede, in the small village of Nossa Senhora das Febres, where his father practiced medicine. In 1933 he moves to Coimbra, where he will stay for 15 years, in order to complete his studies. He graduates from the University of Coimbra in history and philosophy in 1947. The following year he settles definitively in Lisbon. In 1949 he marries √Çngela, whom he had met at the university and was from Madeira, who will become his constant companion and collaborator. He died in his home in Lisbon on 1 July 1981. Writings In 1942 he published his first book of poems Tourism, with illustrations by Fernando Namora, as part of the Novo Cancioneiro collection and in 1943 published his first novel Casa na Duna. In 1944, the novel Alcateia is seized by the censorship of the Estado Novo regime, and the same year is released the second edition of Casa na Duna. In 1945 he publishes a new book of poems, M√£e Pobre. 1945 and the subsequent years will be very fruitful for Carlos de Oliveira, with his participation in the Seara Nova and V√©rtice magazines and collaboration on the book by Fernando Lopes Gra√ßa Marchas, Dan√ßas e Can√ß√µes - a collection of poems by various poets, with compositions by Lopes Gra√ßa, songs that came to be known as \\"heroic\\". In 1953 publishes Uma Abelha na Chuva, his fourth novel, and universally acknowledged as one of the most important works of Portuguese literature, being integrated into the syllabus of the course of Portuguese in secondary schools. In 1957 he organized, with Jos√© Gomes Ferreira, an approach to the Portuguese popular imagination with the two volumes of Contos Tradicionais Portugueses, some of which were later adapted to film by Jo√£o C√©sar Monteiro. In 1968 he published two new books of poetry, Sobre o Lado Esquerdo and Micropaisagem and collaborates with Fernando Lopes in the film adaptation of Uma Abelha na Chuva, completed in 1971. He published in 1971 O Aprendiz de Feiticeiro, a collection of articles and chronicles, and Entre Duas Mem√≥rias, a poetry book. In 1976 he gathers all his poetry in Trabalho Po√©tico, two volumes, which presents his previous books, reviewed, and unpublished poems of Pastoral, book to be published separately the following year. Publishes in 1978 his last novel, Finisterra. He is counted amongst the neorealist poets. He is one of the greatest poets of the 20th century combining social intervention (Neorealism) with reflection about the creative process of writing. His writing is dense and accurate (M√£e Pobre, 1945, Entre Duas Mem√≥rias, 1971). Regarding the novels, he goes from pure neo realism (Casa na Duna, 1943) to the sobriety of the sentiment and the protest (Uma Abelha na Chuva, 1953), ending with the complex (Finisterra, 1978). He died in Lisbon, aged 59.

In September 2010, his conviction was upheld by a Bosnian court, though the sentence had been reduced to 8 years in prison.Bosnia court jails Croatian war crimes deputy, reuters.com, 29 September 2010; accessed 17 December 2015. On 20 January 2015, after serving five years in prison, he was released from prison, after Croatia's Constitutional Court rescinded his war crimes conviction on procedural grounds. His case was sent back to the Supreme Court for retrial.\\"Bosnia frees Croatian politician as war crime conviction quashed\\", enca.com; accessed 3 August 2015. In July 2016, the Supreme Court quashed his verdict and ordered a retrial. Early life and military career Glava≈°' father Ljubomir and his mother Zorka (n√©e Pand≈æiƒá), were born in Drinovci, Grude (present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina) and moved to Osijek in 1949. He attended gymnasium in his home town of Osijek and graduated from the Faculty of Law of the University of Osijek. In 1990 Glava≈° was one of the founders of the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), and one of the most prominent members of that party in Slavonia. In the same year he was elected to the Croatian Parliament (Sabor) and later became part of the last Croatian delegation in the House of Republics and Provinces of the Yugoslav Federal Assembly. When the tensions between the new Croatian government and Croatia's ethnic Serb minority began to escalate, Glava≈° emerged as one of the most militant Croatian politicians, earning the reputation of a maverick. From 12 October 1990 until 24 April 1992 he was secretary of the Secretariat for Defense of the Osijek municipality (Sekretarijat za narodnu obranu opƒáine Osijek), becoming one of the most important officials in charge of defending Osijek and Slavonia.Official biography , branimirglavas.com; accessed 3 August 2015. On 2 November 1991, with Croatian War of Independence already in progress, he was appointed assistant to the commander for the defence of Osijek in charge of territorial co-ordination and public relations. On 1 December 1991 he was appointed to the rank of major (bojnik) and on 7 December 1991 he was appointed commander of defence for Osijek. In April 1992, after the Command for the defence of Osijek was dissolved, he was named Assistant to the Commander of First Operation Zone, Osijek. Political career after the war After demobilisation, on 30 May 1992, he was elected president of Executive council of the Osijek municipality Assembly. At the February 1993 elections he was elected delegate to the Chamber of Counties (≈Ωupanijski dom Sabora), and on 14 April 1993 he became the first prefect (≈æupan) of the Osijek-Baranja County. Over time, Glava≈° developed a rivalry with the Osijek mayor Zlatko Kramariƒá, who was his opposite in everything--from politics to style. After the 1993 local elections, Kramariƒá came to power in Osijek, but Glava≈° and his HDZ kept the rest of the Osijek-Baranja county. In that period Glava≈° surprised many by offering agricultural subsidies to ethnic Serb citizens in then-occupied sections of eastern Slavonia, and explaining that he would be \\"first in peace just as he was first in war\\". At the October 1995 elections he was elected to the Chamber of Representatives (Zastupniƒçki dom Sabora), then he was re- elected to the Chamber of Counties at the April 1997 elections, and in May 1997 he was also reelected prefect of the Osijek-Baranja County. In October 1997 he was named the Inspector of the Croatian Army (Inspektor Hrvatske Vojske) at the Inspectorate General of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Croatia (Glavna Inspekcija Oru≈æanih Snaga Republike Hrvatske), Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Croatia. In February 1999, he returned to his county political office, where he remained until the end of June 2000. In November 1997, he petitioned the authorities to recognize his partial disability, caused by a broken rib injury he sustained while driving near Bjelovar in January 1992. He was later temporarily stripped of the disabled veteran status, until it was reinstated by a court order. He was reelected to the Croatian Parliament in the January 2000 elections. Glava≈° maintained a tight grip on power and eastern Slavonia remained an HDZ stronghold even after the death of Franjo Tuƒëman and his party's loss of power at the national level in 2000. In 2002, when hardliner Iviƒá Pa≈°aliƒá challenged the more moderate HDZ leader Ivo Sanader for party leadership, Glava≈°, despite his own hardline credentials, decided to support Sanader. In the crucial HDZ convention, this endorsement helped Sanader to remain the party chairman. A year later, the HDZ won the November 2003 parliamentary election and Sanader became prime minister, with Glava≈° as one of his most important allies. Glava≈° was reelected to Parliament in the same election. =Split with HDZ= As time went by and Ivo Sanader's policies became less popular, and there were apparent setbacks for Croatia's prospects for entry into the EU, so Glava≈° began to publicly distance himself from Sanader. Glava≈° expressed Euroscepticism with regard to how the EU would handle the Croatian accession negotiations, and was critical towards the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). This process escalated a few days before the start of local elections in May 2005. Glava≈° proclaimed himself to be a regionalist and began to advocate regional reorganisation of Croatia, founding a political organisation with that aim. On 20 April 2005, the programme of the Hrvatski demokratski sabor Slavonije i Baranje - Croatian Democratic Assembly of Slavonia and Baranja - was first published. Glava≈° was immediately ejected from the HDZ the following day but not before persuading almost the entire membership of his local party to support his project and new electoral ticket. In the 2005 Croatian local elections, his list of independent candidates won a relative majority in Osijek and Osijek-Baranja County. This prompted Kramariƒá to approach all other parties in Osijek and attempt to form a broad anti- Glava≈° coalition, an offer which was accepted and resulted in HDZ loyalists being allied with the likes of the Social Democratic Party of Croatia. In June 2005 Glava≈° defeated this scheme, first by allying with the far-right Croatian Party of Rights (HSP), in a coalition that gave the HSP the mayoral position in Osijek for the first time; and then by persuading some assemblymen of the anti-Glava≈° coalition to support his candidates in inaugural sessions of the Osijek-Baranja county and City of Osijek assembly. On 21 May 2005 Glava≈° and his supporters founded a new political party - Hrvatski demokratski savez Slavonije i Baranje - the Croatian Democratic Alliance of Slavonia and Baranja. War crimes charges In July 2005, Glava≈° was publicly implicated in the 1991 murders of Serb civilians in Osijek. In May 2006 Croatian chief prosecutor Mladen Bajiƒá asked the Croatian Parliament to deprive Glava≈° of his parliamentary immunity, in order to start formal criminal proceedings in the case. On 10 May, this request was granted. During the proceedings, prosecutors failed twice in their attempts to have Glava≈° arrested, because investigative magistrates and local courts rejected their demands to issue arrest warrants. However, on 23 October one investigative magistrate issued an arrest warrant, which was approved by the Mandate-Immunity Committee of Croatian Parliament after four days of dramatic and confusing deliberations. Glava≈° was arrested on 26 October and put in jail for fear that he might influence witnesses if he was bailed.Manja Segrt, Croatian legislator Glavas jailed amid war-crime investigation, bloomberg.com, 27 October 2006; accessed 29 October 2006. Osijek's investigative judge Mario Kovac ruled that the case against Glava≈° could begin. Glava≈° subsequently went on hunger strike.Goran Jungvirth, Osijek judge orders Glavas investigation, Institute for War & Peace Reporting, 3 November 2006, accessed 17 November 2006 On 2 December 2006, Glava≈° was released from custody pending his trial, bringing to an end his 37-day hunger strike. The investigating judge had ruled that Glava≈° was too ill to attend legal hearings, and investigations were suspended. On 8 February 2007, the case against Glavas was reopened. Glava≈° was re-indicted on 16 April 2007 at the county court in Osijek, on charges of having given orders to members of a unit under his command to abduct, torture and murder Serbs in late 1991. Following the indictment, he was returned to custody. He started a second hunger strike on 27 April. On 9 May, a second indictment was brought against him on charges of ordering the torture and killing of at least two Serb civilians. His trial began in Osijek on 15 October 2007. In the Croatian elections of 25 November 2007, Glava≈° was re-elected to parliament. This restored his immunity, and he was released from detention. On 14 July 2008, the trial was adjourned until September 2008 because of the purported poor health of one of Glava≈°'s co-accused. Under Croatian law, as there was a break of more than two months in the trial, there had to be a retrial. Glava≈° and his supporters claimed the criminal investigation was politically motivated and pointed to its commencement having coincided with Glava≈°'s departure from the ruling HDZ party. It was also reported that witnesses in the trial, including Osijek-based journalist Drago Hedl, had been threatened. On 8 May 2009 the Zagreb District Court found Glava≈° guilty of torture and murder of Serbian civilians in Osijek, and sentenced him to 10 years in prison. However, Vladimir ≈†i≈°ljagiƒá, the leader of HDSSB, the political party Glava≈° founded when he left HDZ, showed up in court instead of him and stated that he was \\"in a safe place\\". Glava≈° fled the country, reportedly to Herzegovina, having procured citizenship in Bosnia-Herzegovina seven months earlier.\\"Branimir Glavas flees to BiH\\", Information Agency Focus, 9 May 2009.\\"Glava≈°'s Goodbye to the People and Sanader\\", lupiga.com, 8 May 2009. Glava≈° was arrested near the Bosnian town of Kupres on 13 May 2009. The Croatian Ministry of Justice filed a request for his extradition but this was rejected on 23 June 2009. In June 2010, the Supreme Court of Croatia confirmed the guilty verdict for Glava≈° and others, but reduced the sentence slightly, to eight years of prison. The verdict caused his membership in the Parliament to be automatically rescinded, together with the immunity and other privileges he continued to enjoy up to it. The parliamentary committee subsequently decided that his mandate ended with the day of the final verdict, 2 May 2010, a decision he publicly appealed saying they owe him one salary. Another scandal arose after it was discovered that prominent members of Glava≈°' political party had participated in a plot to bribe members of the Supreme Court to show him leniency. Based upon the agreement of mutual execution of criminal sanctions between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina confirmed the second-instance verdict and Glava≈° was arrested in Drinovci on 28 September 2010. Decorations Due to his contribution during Croatian War of Independence Glava≈° was rewarded with several medals: *Homeland's Gratitude Medal *Homeland War Memorial Medal *Order of the Croatian Trefoil *Order of Ante Starƒçeviƒá *Order of Ban Jelaƒçiƒá *Order of Duke Domagoj *Order of Duke Trpimir After his war crimes conviction, the revocation of these decorations was an oft-mentioned topic in the media, and both Croatian Presidents Mesiƒá and Josipoviƒá said that they would handle the issue according to the law which states that illegal and immoral acts are grounds for revocation. Following the Supreme Court verdict, President Josipoviƒá formally took away the decorations, but not before Glava≈° claimed to the media that he had sold his medals. Josipoviƒá responded by stating that the metal insignia can be dealt with whichever way one wishes to deal with them, but that the moral content of the honor is bestowed by the President of the Republic. In August 2010, President Josipoviƒá also said that Glava≈° would enter a military procedure for his rank of general to be rescinded, according to a law that says officers who are given a prolonged prison sentence (over three years) lose their rank. A month later, he issued a decision to that effect for Mirko Norac, Vladimir Zagorec, Tihomir Ore≈°koviƒá and Sini≈°a Rimac also. He was incarcerated in the southern Bosnian town of Mostar. On 20 January 2015, after serving five years in prison, he was released from prison, after Croatia's Constitutional Court rescinded his war crimes conviction on procedural grounds. The case was sent back to the Supreme Court for a retrial. He is the highest ranking Croatian official convicted for war crimes by local judiciary.

Cushman & Wakefield is among the world's largest commercial real estate services firms, with revenues of US$8.8 billion in 2019. The company operates from approximately 400 offices in 60 countries, has around 53,000 employees and manages about 4.1 billion square feet of commercial space. History Cushman & Wakefield was founded in New York City on October 31, 1917, by brothers-in- law J. Clydesdale Cushman and Bernard Wakefield. In the 1960s, Cushman & Wakefield began a national expansion, establishing offices throughout the U.S. In 1969, RCA acquired Cushman & Wakefield, selling its stake to The Rockefeller Group in 1976. In 1989, Mitsubishi Estate Co. Ltd. became the majority shareholder in The Rockefeller Group. In 1990, a presence in Europe was established through the acquisition of Healey & Baker. George Healey founded the firm in 1910, taking building leases near Regent's Park during the construction of Regent Street. He was joined by partner George Henry Baker, who joined the firm in 1910, and whose name was added to the firm's in 1920. Baker initiated the firm's focus on commercial property. In 1994, C&W; worldwide partnership was established with real estate services firms in the U.S., Europe, Asia, South America, Mexico, and Canada. In 2001, Cushman & Wakefield acquired Cushman Realty Corporation (CRC), increasing its presence on the West Coast and Southwest United States, bringing CRC founders John C. Cushman III and Louis B. Cushman back to the firm founded by their grandfather, J. Clydesdale Cushman and great-uncle, Bernard Wakefield. John C. Cushman became Chairman of the Board of Directors, and Louis B. Cushman, Vice Chairman. In 2002, the Cushman & Wakefield Alliance Program was formed to expand service capabilities for clients in U.S. markets where owned offices were not maintained. In 2007, IFIL (now known as EXOR), the investment group of the Agnelli family, acquired an approximately 70 percent stake in Cushman & Wakefield becoming the firm's majority shareholders and replacing the Rockefeller Group as majority shareholder of the firm. That same year, Cushman & Wakefield carried out a series of acquisitions which include real estate investment banking firm Sonnenblick Goldman, Semco, Alston Nock. On February 24, 2015, it was confirmed that Exor SpA had approved management's hiring of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley to help look for a buyer for Cushman. On May 11, 2015, DTZ, a commercial-real-estate-services firm backed by private-equity giant TPG, PAG Asia Capital, and Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan (OTTP), agreed to buy Cushman & Wakefield Inc. for $2 billion. On September 1, 2015, Cushman & Wakefield and DTZ merged. The firm now operates under the Cushman & Wakefield brand. The new Cushman & Wakefield is majority owned by an investor group led by TPG, PAG, and OTPP. The two companies combined for $6 billion in revenues and 45,000 employees. In 2016, the two engaged in more than $191 billion in commercial real estate transactions and approximately 4.3 billion square feet under management. In October 2017, Chaney Brooks became an alliance partner with Cushman & Wakefield establishing a foothold in the Hawaii & Guam markets by partnering with one of the oldest commercial real estate firms in the islands. In March 2018, Cushman & Wakefield had debts amounting to $3.1 billion, an increase of $300 million compared with the end of 2017. The company had a debt-annual revenue ratio of 44 %, which was higher than that of its competitors CBRE Group, JLL and Zillow. In June 2018, Cushman & Wakefield filed an S1 form with the Securities & Exchange Commission announcing its intent to be listed on the NYSE. It became listed on the New York Stock Exchange on August 2, 2018.

Misconception A common misconception is that DTX improves capacity by freeing up TDMA time slots for use by other conversations. In practice, the unpredictable availability of time slots makes this difficult to implement. However, reducing interference is a significant component in how GSM and other TDMA based mobile phone systems make better use of the available spectrum compared to older analog systems such as AMPS and NMT. While older network types theoretically allocated two 25‚Äì30 kHz channels per conversation, in practice some radios would cause interference on neighbouring channels making them unusable, and a single radio may broadcast too strong an oval signal pattern to let nearby cells reuse the same channel. GSM combines short packet sizes, frequency hopping, redundancy, power control, digital encoding, and DTX to minimize interference and the effects of interference on a conversation. In this respect, DTX indirectly improves the over-all capacity of a network. Packet radio systems In packet radio systems such as GPRS/EDGE, it is possible to combine DTX with capacity increase when VoIP is used for telephony. In such cases, resources freed up when one user is in silence can be used to serve another user. The increase of the number of users will contribute to the interference level. Systems that use voice codecs such as AMR can reduce vocoder rate adaptively to better combat interference. Systems based upon CDMA air interfaces such as IS-95/CDMA2000, and most forms of UMTS, can use a form of implied DTX by usage of a variable rate codec such as AMR. As with the packet radio systems above, when one side of the conversion is silent, the amount of transmitted data is minimized. Again, the effect is reduced interference. In wireless transmitters, VAD is sometimes called voice- operated transmission (VOX).

Background noise spikes can often be confused with the speech frame and hence, in order to nullify this issue, a check list for SID computation is Nelapsed >23, old SID is utilized with VAD=0. Once after the end of speech SID is computed it is continuously passed to the RSS marked with SP=0 as long as VAD=0.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 12, 1995. In the episode, Homer becomes a Krusty the Clown impersonator, but is mistaken for the real Krusty by the Springfield Mafia. Joe Mantegna returned as Fat Tony, while Dick Cavett and Johnny Unitas guest starred as themselves. The episode was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by David Silverman. Swartzwelder's script required very little rewriting and Silverman considers this one of the best episodes he has directed. He later used it to help him when directing The Simpsons Movie. One dropped storyline for The Simpsons saw Krusty being revealed as Homer's secret identity and this episode allowed writers to comment upon the similarity of the two characters' design. The episode features references to Close Encounters of the Third Kind, The Godfather, and The Maltese Falcon. Plot Krusty's gambling debts and spendthrifting land him in deep trouble with the Springfield Mafia. To make more money, he launches a training college for clowns, where Homer enrolls. After graduating, he impersonates Krusty at events that the real Krusty deems beneath him, such as children's birthday parties and the unveiling of a new sandwich at Krusty Burger. The stress of impersonating Krusty makes Homer consider quitting. He soon discovers his uncanny resemblance to the clown has its benefits: Chief Wiggum rips up a speeding ticket when he mistakes Homer for Krusty, and Apu gives him a discount at the Kwik-E-Mart. Later, Homer realises that impersonating Krusty also has its pitfalls: Homer is kidnapped by the Mafia when they mistake him for Krusty, who still owes them money. Don Vittorio DiMaggio tells Homer he will kill him unless he performs a loop-the- loop on a tiny bicycle, the only trick Homer never did master at clown college. After he fails to perform the stunt to DiMaggio's satisfaction, the Mafioso is deeply offended. Soon the real Krusty arrives and the confused DiMaggio forces them to perform the stunt together on the same tiny bicycle ‚Äî they succeed and their lives are spared, but Krusty is still made to pay off his $48 gambling debt to the mob.

Commentary for \\"Homie the Clown\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Silverman felt he himself \\"brought a lot to the party on [this] one\\", and although \\"people didn't like [Swartzwelder's script] at the read-through\\", Silverman thought \\"the script was really funny, and I had an idea for the opening and presented it with a lot of circus music that inspired the music they used for it. It was great fun.\\" He used it, along with \\"Three Men and a Comic Book\\", to help him when directing The Simpsons Movie. Brad Bird also helped Silverman, particularly with Krusty's design. An early idea for The Simpsons saw Krusty the Clown being revealed as Homer Simpson's secret stage identity. This storyline never developed, but this episode allowed writers to comment upon the design similarity of the two characters. Krusty's appearance and design is just that of Homer's, with clown make-up. Silverman enhanced the lines under Krusty's eyes, and reshaped his beard line in order to make a clearer distinction between the two characters. Homer beating up the Estonian dwarf (who first appeared in \\"Burns' Heir\\") was a joke Matt Groening \\"had trouble with\\". David Mirkin wanted the scene to be violent, but Silverman stated that he thought he had animated the finished product to be too realistic. However, nothing was changed.Groening, Matt (2005). Commentary for \\"Homie the Clown\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Fox objected to the mafia buying ammunition from a Big 5 Sporting Goods until Mirkin pointed out that Big 5 sold ammunition. The second act break was, up until the animatic, after Fat Tony's line \\"cancel the world search\\". Joe Mantegna returned as Fat Tony. Mirkin said Mantegna is a joy to direct and that Mantegna loves the role so much, he wishes to voice him \\"even if he only coughs\\". Dick Cavett guest-starred as himself. Mirkin commented that Cavett's part was probably the \\"meanest\\" they had ever been to a guest star. Cavett often told stories involving himself and other famous people and Mirkin decided to make light of that. Cavett did not have any objections. Cultural references Silverman inserted a low-angle shot of Fat Tony sitting in a chair as a tribute to a similar shot of Sydney Greenstreet's character in The Maltese Falcon. * The episode's title is reference to the character Homey D. Clown from the sketch comedy show In Living Color. * Krusty lights a cigarette with an issue of Action Comics #1, the first appearance of Superman, and one of the rarest comic books of all time. * Homer forms his mashed potatoes into a circus tent in a parody of Richard Dreyfuss' character forming his potatoes into a replica of Devils Tower in the 1977 film Close Encounters of the Third Kind. * The episode contains several references to films related to organized crime, such as the notes played on the wine glasses during Homer and Krusty's bicycle trick forming those of the theme from the film The Godfather. * Silverman inserted a low-angle shot of Fat Tony sitting in a chair as a tribute to a similar shot of Sydney Greenstreet's character in The Maltese Falcon, while Don Vittorio is based on actors William Hickey and Don Ameche. Reception In its original broadcast, \\"Homie the Clown\\" finished 59th (tied with Behind Closed Doors II) in the ratings for the week of February 5 to February 12, 1995, helping Fox to an overall Nielsen rating of 7.9. The episode was the fifth highest rated show on the Fox network that week. Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, the authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, stated the episode was \\"notable for its scenes of Homer on trying to emulate Krusty's mini-trike loop the loops\\". Ryan Keefer of DVD Verdict felt it \\"features one of the more amusing stunts to cap an episode\\", giving it an A. Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide said in a review of the sixth season DVD that the episode \\"offers a truly terrific show\\", and praised the \\"clever Close Encounters reference, and the ways that it ties together Krusty's mob connection with Homer\\", concluding \\"it's a real winner\\". Mike Brantley of The Mobile Register named \\"Homie the Clown\\" the 48th greatest television episode of all-time. When The Simpsons began streaming on Disney+ in 2019, former Simpsons writer and executive producer Bill Oakley named this one of the best classic Simpsons episodes to watch on the service.

This treaty was a smaller follow-up treaty to that of the Treaty of Roskilde, which decisively delineated the mutually recognized boundaries of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway; boundaries which are almost exactly the same to this day. Opening positions Charles X of Sweden would not accept any other outcome than Sweden's receipt of Akershus county, in exchange for the return of Tr√∏ndelag and Bornholm to Denmark-Norway; Frederick III of Denmark on the other hand refused to abide by the terms of the Treaty of Roskilde, instead wanting to revert to the conditions of the Second Treaty of Br√∂msebro (1645). Both kings were stubborn, and had to depend on the mediating powers, France and England on the Swedish side, and the Dutch Republic on the Danish side, to bring about a treaty. Frederick argued to his Dutch allies that Swedish control of Scania would present an eternal lingering threat to Copenhagen, and proposed a Danish-Dutch alliance to retake Scania. Frederick had the support of Brandenburg and Austria, but the Dutch had already agreed with England that preventing the western and eastern shore of √òresund from being controlled by the same country would in turn prevent future raises of the √òresund toll, which would cause disruption in the Dutch and English Baltic trade. In addition, Cardinal Jules Mazarin threatened a French invasion of the Netherlands if it were to assist Denmark against Sweden. When learning of Charles' death in February 1660, Frederick immediately proclaimed the Treaty of Roskilde null and void. This caused great alarm to the Swedish mediators, but their French and English counterparts assured them that if Sweden were to yield their claim to Tr√∏ndelag but otherwise stick by the terms of Roskilde, France and England would assure a treaty under those conditions. Denmark insisted on the return of the Scanian lands, with the support of Brandenburg, Austria and Poland, but this time the Dutch did not agree with Denmark. On 8 March 1660, admiral Michiel de Ruyter and his Dutch fleet were ordered to leave the harbour of Landskrona, where he had bottled up the Swedish fleet. Frederick yielded, and the negotiations began in earnest on 24 March. Negotiations The most contentious point was regarding the control of the island of Bornholm. The people of Bornholm had risen against their Swedish occupants, and killed the Swedish commander, Johan Printzensk√∂ld. They now feared retribution, were the island to remain in Swedish hands. Frederick had given his word of honour to protect his faithful subjects to the utmost; he kept his promise by demanding the return of Bornholm to Denmark despite the threats of Sweden and the negotiating powers. It was then suggested that Denmark would provide compensation by ceding several estates held by Danish noble families in Scania to the crown of Sweden. At this point, however, the negotiations started to derail as the mediating countries' representatives became involved in intrigues that weren't in the interests of their client states. Exasperated by the slow progress of the negotiations, Hannibal Sehested suggested that negotiations should proceed directly between Denmark and Sweden. The suggestion was accepted by the Swedes, and in a few days the conditions of the treaty were agreed upon. Terms Sweden in yellow, Denmark-Norway in red. Sweden had to return Tr√∏ndelag and Bornholm to Denmark- Norway. Ceded areas in green. On 27 May, the treaty was signed in the tents that had been erected halfway between Copenhagen and the fortified Swedish camp of Carlstad. Four days later the remnants of the Swedish army in Zealand, now numbering 3,000, finally began leaving the outskirts of Copenhagen. The terms of the treaty were as follows: * Sweden kept the territories east of the Sound, including the island of Ven, Scania, Halland, Blekinge, Bohusl√§n. * Sweden was exempted from the Sound Dues. * Tr√∏ndelag, then including Nordm√∏re and Romsdal, was returned to Norway and Bornholm to Denmark. * All Danish and Norwegian fortifications captured by Sweden, excepting fortifications in provinces ceded to Sweden, were to be evacuated within a fortnight after the ratifications of the treaty had been exchanged. * The Crown of Sweden was to receive an indemnity in the form of several nobles' estates in Scania in return for the returning of Bornholm to Denmark. The Danish Crown would later reimburse the nobles with estates in Denmark. * Denmark was to pay an annual 3,500 riksdaler to maintain the beacons between Skagen on the Danish side and Falsterbo on the Swedish side. * All prisoners of war on both sides were to be released. * All previous treaties between Denmark and Sweden were reaffirmed.

It aims to provide a 'counterbalance' to the academic rigour of the educational programme. Before the 2010 examination there was a 150-hour requirement, with an approximately equal distribution of creativity, activity, and service. This requirement was removed mainly for two reasons: to ensure that students engage in meaningful activities and to decrease the amount of CAS fraud (i.e. claiming hours which have not been completed). Students are now expected to have two CAS activities for each CAS category and students need to prove that they are participating in CAS activities on a weekly basis (though not necessarily all CAS categories each week). Moreover, students must have one CAS project which spans at least a month. Finally one must prove that the CAS activities have resulted in the seven projected outcomes of CAS (one CAS activity can have multiple outcomes). CAS aims The function of CAS is to allow IB schools the opportunity to \\"give students the means to learn through experience [and] how to take actions in the service of others.\\" All the portions (creativity, activity, and service) are vaguely defined and should, according to the International Baccalaureate Organisation, be interpreted as imaginatively as possible, so that a wide array of different activities can qualify for CAS. The learning outcomes and the quality of the CAS activity are of utmost importance. Documentation While individual schools or regions have different methods of documentation, all require some form of proof or the signature of the supervisor of the experience to be presented after its completion. Students must also personally keep track of their CAS work in either a log or \\"diary\\" format.http://casjuanfelipediaz.blogspot.com/ This allows for students to monitor their required hours and to present a coherent documentation of their entire CAS experience, including reflections on their experiences. Some schools subscribe to online tools such as ManageBac, which include pages on which students can document their experiences and post reflections. Assessment CAS is internally assessed. However, IBO can ask for a number of random samples to be submitted. A failure to complete and provide evidence for completion is considered a failing condition for the entire Diploma (although candidates are given another year to finish their CAS program if they fail, and if they complete it in this time they will receive their diploma).

He is best known as the host of the weekday breakfast show on the London-based radio station LBC and, with 1.5 million daily listeners, is currently the most-listened-to host on LBC . He also has a regular column in the Sunday Express and was previously a regular guest on The Alan Titchmarsh Show. He regularly appears on ITV's programme This Morning and has presented the Sky News debate show The Pledge since 2016.  Early life  His father, Lino \\"Dan\\" Ferrari, ran a news agency, Ferrari Press Agency, and Nick was keen to work in the media himself. According to The Independent, The Evening Standard, The Guardian and the Guide to Independent Schools, he was educated at Eltham College, a private school for boys in Mottingham in southeast London. Despite a keen interest in journalism, Ferrari initially wanted to become a vet and only changed career path after meeting Norman Scott through his father. He later turned down the option to study at the University of Cambridge to join a local newspaper. Career =Journalism= Ferrari became a news reporter on the Sunday Mirror in 1981 and subsequently a show business reporter at The Sun and editor of the paper's \\"Bizarre\\" gossip page. During this period, he interviewed Roger Moore on the set of the James Bond film Octopussy for The Sun and appeared as an extra in the movie. Subsequently he became features editor of the News of the World's Sunday magazine and assistant editor of the Daily Mirror. A friend of former The Sun editor Kelvin MacKenzie, Ferrari joined him at L!VE TV where he devised such programmes as Topless Darts, the News Bunnyhttps://www.marketingweek.com/kelvin-pulls-rabbits-out-of-his-hat/ and the weather presented by a dwarf on a trampoline.https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/mar/03/lbc-nick-ferrari- nick-clegg =Radio= Ferrari joined Talk Radio in 1999 as co-presenter of the Big Boys' Breakfast show with David Banks., shortly after the station was purchased by former colleague Kelvin MacKenzie in 1998. The show was scheduled between 6am and 9am and focused on entertainment rather than news content. In late 1999 it was announced that the show would be cancelled as part of the relaunch of Talk Radio as Talk Sport to focus entirely on sports content. In 2001 Ferrari presented his first breakfast programme on LBC, taking on the role officially in 2004. The programme runs from 7am to 10am and takes the format of a news and political debate and discussion show with the presenter introducing topics and then discussing them with both members of the public and experts, through text messaging, email and phone, with the last of the three being the main mode of contact. The programme mixes both light entertainment stories and more serious topics in the news. Ferrari frequently asks first-time callers which station they previously listened to, rejoicing when they have deserted BBC Radio 4, BBC London 94.9 or rival station Capital FM. Ferrari is also known for deliberately not mentioning the phone number to call the programme whilst presenting as he believes it is an unnatural way to speak to listeners. In the run-up to the 2017 General Election an interview with Diane Abbott on Ferrari's show made national headlines after she struggled to provide figures for police policy. When questioned on the policy Abbott stated 10,000 police officers would cost ¬£300,000, before correcting herself to ¬£80 million. Ferrari questioned further on this figure and pointed out that it would only allow for paying each police officer ¬£8,000. In a subsequent article Ferrari stated that he had banned Dianne Abbott from his show due to her failing to appear for previous scheduled interviews and had only allowed her to feature to aid the balance of subjects interviewed on the programme. Later the same day the BBC's The Daily Politics replayed the interview to Abbott where she defended her performance, saying: \\"I did seven interviews this morning. In that seventh interview I misspoke\\". Ferrari was awarded the 2018 IRN Best Interview award for his role in interviewing Diane Abbott where judges praised him for \\"[representing] the role of listeners and voters brilliantly\\". The show received the Sony Breakfast Show of the Year award in 2006 as well as the Arqiva Breakfast Show of the year in 2010. Ferrari was also awarded the Sony Speech Broadcaster of the year in 2009. and the Arqiva Gold Award in 2010 for \\"outstanding contribution to the industry over the last twelve months\\". =Television= Ferrari presented the discussion programme Forum on Press TV, an Iranian news channel. He quit his show on the station on 30 June 2009 in protest at the reporting of the Iranian presidential election on 12 June 2009. In 2006, Ferrari also made an appearance on the BBC/HBO comedy show Extras. =Politics= It was suggested in June 2006 by Conservative leader David Cameron that, if he joined the Conservative Party and put himself forward, Ferrari could win the ballot to be the party's candidate for Mayor of London. Ferrari indicated, however, that he would not stand, as he \\"did not want to leave the listeners\\" and joked that he \\"couldn't take the pay cut\\". Later, he began to see merit in the idea and discussed what policies he might introduce should he become Mayor: amongst these were re-introducing the AEC Routemaster buses (with various modifications so that they would conform to disability and environmental laws) and scrapping the Mercedes-Benz \\"Bendy Buses\\" and, more controversially, putting a large levy on trainers in the run-up to the 2012 Olympic Games and doubling income tax on Human Rights lawyers. Ferrari later indicated that he would not stand as the Conservative candidate, a role that was taken by Boris Johnson. Ferrari does not recycle because the number of recycle bins mean \\"you've lost your front garden\\", he said on BBC's The Daily Politics. Ferrari voted to Leave in the 2016 EU membership referendum, but did not agree with the government's settled status fee (which was later scrapped)\\"I didn't vote for brexit for you to be treated so disgracefully\\", LBC, 21 January 2019. In September 2019, Ferrari said, after a visit to Israel, \\"I‚Äôd been given an insight into a country that I‚Äôve always admired and I now revered\\" Controversy In 2003, the Broadcasting Standards Commission upheld a complaint against Ferrari, finding that his programme's \\"active reinforcement of prejudiced views about asylum seekers had exceeded acceptable boundaries for transmission\\". Following this, and at a time of frosty relations between Ferrari and the former Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, the Mayor wrote to the Managing Director of LBC 97.3 asking what measures had been implemented to ensure the situation would not arise again. Following this, Livingstone appeared regularly on Ferrari's programme to answer questions from listeners. In 2015, Ferrari was investigated by Ofcom after he said on his radio programme that the November 2015 Paris attacks were \\"a Muslim problem\\" and told a Muslim caller to \\"go some place else\\" if the caller didn't agree with UK foreign policy. Ofcom found Ferrari not in breach of any broadcasting rules, saying \\"We found the caller was given an opportunity to rebuke Mr Ferrari's offensive comments, while two other callers also challenged Ferrari in strong terms. In addition, the presenter made clear that he was not characterising all Muslims as extremists or criminals\\". On a May 2018 Sky News panel, Ferrari reacted to Afua Hirsch's questioning of statues of Horatio Nelson, Cecil Rhodes and Winston Churchill by saying: \\"Why do you stay in this country, if you take such offence when you see Nelson's column, if you take such offence when you hear Winston Churchill's name? ‚Ä¶ If it offends you so much, how do you manage to stay here?\\" Hirsch, who argued that it was because she loved her country that she questioned it, was born in Norway, to a British father and Ghanaian mother, but raised in Wimbledon. A controversy erupted on social media when Afua Hirsch tweeted an excerpt of the exchange in June 2020. Critics questioned whether Ferrari would have equally suggested that a white British person might wish to leave the UK. Personal life Ferrari is a supporter of Leicester City.

Groundskeeping is the activity of tending an area of land for aesthetic or functional purposes; typically in an institutional setting. It includes mowing grass, trimming hedges, pulling weeds, planting flowers, etc. The U.S. Department of Labor estimated that more than 900,000 workers are employed in the landscape maintenance and groundskeeping services industry in the United States in 2006.

Groundskeepers A groundskeeper is a person who maintains landscaping, gardens or sporting venues (and their vegetation where appropriate) for appearance and functionality. In Britain the word groundsman (occasionally groundswoman if appropriate) or park-keeper is used much more commonly.groundskeeper in Oxford Dictionaries Online: \\"North American term for groundsman.\\"park-keeper in Oxford Dictionaries Online: \\"The caretaker of a park.\\" In Australia, the word curator is often used for a person undertaking this job, especially those involving cricket pitches. At university campuses, groundskeepers are often called horticulturists. The equivalent on a golf course is a greenskeeper. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) estimated in May 2015 that statistical group 37-3011 \\"Landscaping and Groundskeeping Workers\\" numbered 895,600 with a median annual wage of $25,030. The BLS describes the functions of this group as \\"Workers typically perform a variety of tasks, which may include any combination of the following: sod laying, mowing, trimming, planting, watering, fertilizing, digging, raking, sprinkler installation, and installation of mortarless segmental concrete masonry wall units\\". Wrigley Field Grounds crew smooths the infield dirt. A groundskeeper's job requires a wide range of knowledge of horticulture, pest control, and weed abatement. As many institutions (especially schools) are moving away from the use of chemical pesticides and toward integrated pest management the experience, knowledge and scholastic requirements of top groundskeepers are increasing. While groundskeepers usually follow a site plan created by a landscape architect, there can be many opportunities for creativity in detailed design and presentation. Groundskeeping equipment Groundskeeping equipment comprise implements and vehicles used in groundskeeping, including: * mowers * lawn mowers * tractors * string trimmers * snow blowers * snow plows * edgers * rotary brushes * rakes * leaf blowers * shovels * trowels * sprinklers * garden tools * watering cans or truck mounted watering system (polyethylene tank and hoses) * line markers Environmental impact Pollution from gas- powered groundskeeping equipment is a significant source of air pollution.Lawn Equipment  Improving Air Quality in Your Community  US EPA US emission standards specifically limit emissions from small engines. Electric models produce no emissions at the point of use, but may shift pollution to power plants. Emissions may still be reduced by the use of renewable energy in grid generation, or because central power plants generally must have stricter emissions control equipment installed. Groundskeepers in fiction Groundskeepers have appeared occasionally as minor characters in fiction and moving images. They are usually presented as comic or peculiar characters, often exhibiting a compulsive or obsessive personality defect. Some examples of fictional groundskeepers include: * On Cartoon Network's animated series Regular Show, Mordecai, Rigby, Skips, Muscle Man, High Five Ghost and Thomas are groundskeepers at a local park. * Groundskeeper Willie is a gruff speaking Scot in the television animated series The Simpsons.

S. (, , ) was a 16th-century painter in Central Europe in late Gothic and early Renaissance art. He was active in Bansk√° ≈†tiavnica (to 1918 Selmecb√°nya in the Kingdom of Hungary, since 1993 in Slovakia) and probably led a workshop there. Since his true name is unknown, he is sometimes identified with various other Gothic \\"masters\\". German art historians generally identify him with J. Brieu, a painter from Augsburg. Also some art historians identify him with the engraver Master MZ, often identified as Matth√§us Zaisinger (1498‚Äì1555), a German goldsmith from Munich. According to other research the master could have been a Hungarian painter called Sebesty√©n, whose name is mentioned in the charter of Bansk√° ≈†tiavnica in 1507.MASTER M S in the Web Gallery of Art The art historian Mikl√≥s Mojzer noted the similarities between this work and that of the painter who accompanied Veit Stoss and made the passion paintings in an altar now in the Esztergom Christian Museum and he called him Marten Swarcz.Master MS in Esztergom Christian MuseumObituary Mikl√≥s Mojzer His art combining dramatic depth and colourful decorative formation is akin to that of the German painters Martin Schongauer, Albrecht D√ºrer, J. Brieu and mainly Mathias Gr√ºnewald. Only seven of his panel paintings are known out of eight which used to decorate the high altar of a church in Bansk√° ≈†tiavnica. It was believed that the altar was in the Saint Catherine Church, but according to the new research the pictures were part of the altar in the Virgin Mary Church, later rebuilt into the fortress called the Old Castle. Now there are four Passion paintings in Esztergom, Hungary, in the Christian Museum; the painting \\"The Birth of Christ\\" is held in Sv√§t√Ω Anton (formerly known also as Hontszentantal) near Bansk√° ≈†tiavnica, and The Adoration of the Magi is in the Museum of Lille in France. His painting entitled \\"The Visitation\\" depicts the meeting of the two saints, the Virgin Mary and St. Elizabeth, is in Budapest, in the Hungarian National Gallery. There are also three more-than-life-size wood-carved polychromed sculptures preserved which originally belong to the same altar. The statue of Madonna is in the Saint Catherine Church of Bansk√° ≈†tiavnica, the statues of Saint Catherine and Saint Barbara are in the art gallery of the Slovak Mining Museum in Bansk√° ≈†tiavnica. At the Old Castle in Bansk√° ≈†tiavnica, a half-sized maquette of the altar is exhibited, featuring full-coloured photocopies of all the known panel paintings by Master MS, as well as fragments of decorative wood carvings which presumably were parts of the altar.

The surname Muravyov has also been transcribed as Muravyev or Murav'ev.E.g., in Early life and career Nikolay Muravyov was born in St. Petersburg. He graduated from the Page Corps in 1827. He participated in the Siege of Varna in the Russo-Turkish War in 1828‚Äì1829, and later in suppression of the November Uprising in Poland in 1831. Due to health reasons, he retired from the military in 1833 and returned home to manage his father's estate. However, he returned to active duty in 1838, as General Golovin's aide-de-camp, to serve in the Caucasus region. During one of the campaigns against the mountain people Muravyov was wounded.

Muravyov-Amursky Peninsula (not labeled on this map) is the site of the city of Vladivostok on the Sea of Japan In 1840, Muravyov was assigned to command one of the sections of the Black Sea coast defense lines, during which time he participated in the suppression of the Ubykh people. Muravyov was promoted in rank to major-general in 1841, but had to permanently retire from the military due to illness. He transferred to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and was appointed as an acting military and civil governor of Tula province in 1846. Eager in his willingness to improve the province's state of affairs, he proposed to establish the governorate agricultural society. Muravyov was the first governor to propose Tsar Nicholas I to abolish serfdom; a motion signed by nine local land-owners. While the tsar did nothing about the petition, from then on he always referred to Muravyov as a \\"liberal\\" and a \\"democrat\\". Government of East Siberia The Sino-Russian border in the Amur Basin 1689‚Äì1858, shown on an 1851 map. Irkutsk (Irkoutsk) was the main Russian city in Eastern Siberia, and Nerchinsk, in Muravyov's Transbaikalia, was the major Russian town on the Amur system. (Muravyov's base, Chita, is not shown, because it was too new and too small at the time). Aigun (Saghalian Oula), was the main Qing town on the Amur. On September 5, 1847, Muravyov was appointed the governor-general of Irkutsk and Yeniseysk (Eastern Siberia). His appointment was a subject of much controversy, as it was unusual for a person of his age (only 38 at the time) to be put in charge of such a vast territory. Contrary to the views of Karl Nesselrode, the Russian Foreign Minister, Muravyov was personally instructed by Tsar Nicholas I to press for an advantage against China.Edgar Franz, Philipp Franz von Siebold and Russian Policy and Action on Opening Japan to the West in the Middle of the Nineteenth Century, Munich: Iudicum 2005 Muravyov's first action as governor-general was to put end to the embezzlement of public funds. He also mandated the study of the Russian language in schools for native Siberian and Far Eastern peoples. He pursued the exploration and settlement of the territories north of the Amur River, often utilizing the help of political exiles. Many of his actions were aimed to expand commerce in the Far Eastern region. Seeing religion as a powerful form of control over the local population, he favored the building of new Christian churches and promoted local religious beliefs such as shamanism and Buddhism. After the 1689 Treaty of Nerchinsk, Russia lost the right to navigate the Amur River. Muravyov insisted on conducting an aggressive policy with China despite strong resistance from St. Petersburg officials, who feared a breakdown in relations between the two countries. Nevertheless, because the lower reaches of the Amur River were, in fact, being claimed by the Russians, several expeditions organized by Gennady Nevelskoy had been approved by the government. In 1851‚Äì1853, several expeditions were sent to the Amur Liman and Sakhalin, with Russian settlements being established in those areas. Boats of Muravyov's first expedition (1854) off Aigun On , Tsar Nicholas I authorized Muravyov to carry the negotiations with the Chinese regarding establishing a border along the Amur River and to transport troops to the Amur's estuary. In 1854‚Äì1858, Muravyov assisted Gennady Nevelskoy in achieving that goal. The first expedition took place in May 1854. A fleet of 77 barges and rafts, led by the steamship Argun, sailed down to the Amur's estuary. Due to the Crimean War, a portion of the fleet was then sent to Kamchatka's Avacha Bay, where a series of artillery batteries was established to defend the peninsula. The batteries played a major role in defending the city of Petropavlovsk (see Siege of Petropavlovsk), which was attacked by the English and French forces. The 1855's expedition transported the first Russian settlers to the Amur's estuary. Muravyov started negotiations with the Chinese about that time. Treaty of Aigun Photograph of Muravyov-Amursky (date unknown) During the last expedition of 1858, Muravyov concluded the Treaty of Aigun with the Qing official Yishan. The Chinese were initially against setting any kinds of boundaries along the Amur River, preferring the status quo of keeping the adjacent territories under joint control of Russia and China. Muravyov, however, was able to persuade the Chinese that Russia's intentions were peaceful and constructive. The Treaty of Aigun effectively recognized the Amur River as the boundary between Russia and Qing Empire and granted Russia free access to the Pacific Ocean. For this, Muravyov was granted the title of Count Amursky (i.e., \\"of the Amur River\\"). According to an article by the Russian novelist Vladimir Barayev,–í–ª–∞–¥–∏–º–∏—Ä –ë–∞—Ä–∞–µ–≤ –ø—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–∞–≤–ª—è–µ—Ç –Ω–æ–≤—ã–π —Ä–æ–º–∞–Ω ¬´–ì–æ–Ω–µ—Ü –ß–∏–Ω–≥–∏—Å—Ö–∞–Ω–∞¬ª (Vladimir Barayev presents his new novel, Ghengis Khan's messenger) the signing of the treaty was celebrated by grandiose illumination in Peking and festivities in major Siberian cities.Vladimir Barayev, \\"–ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞–π –ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞–µ–≤–∏—á –ú—É—Ä–∞–≤—å—ë–≤-–ê–º—É—Ä—Å–∫–∏–π\\" (Nikolay Nikolayevich Muravyov-Amursky). –ê–ª—Ñ–∞–≤–∏—Ç (Alfavit) newspaper, No. 30, 2000 The new territories acquired by Russia included Priamurye and most of the territories of modern Primorsky and Khabarovsk krais (territories). The Treaty of Aigun was confirmed and expanded by the provisions of the Beijing Treaty of 1860, which granted Russia right to the Ussuri krai and southern parts of Primorye. As a governor general of Eastern Siberia, Muravyov-Amursky made numerous attempts to settle the shores of the Amur River. These attempts were mostly unsuccessful as very few people wanted to move to the Amur voluntarily. Muravyov had to transfer several Baikal Cossacks detachments to populate the area. Also unsuccessful were attempts to organize steamboat transportation on the Amur and to build a postal road. As the main objection of the St. Petersburg officials against taking over the left bank of the Amur was lack of people to defend the new territories, Muravyov-Amursky successfully petitioned to free Nerchinsk peasants from mandatory works in the ore mines. With these people, a 12,000 corps of Amur Cossacks was formed and used to settle some of the lands, the military core being the Cossacks transferred from the Transbaikalia. Muravyov- Amursky retired from his post of governor general in 1861 after his proposal to divide Eastern Siberia into two separate governorates general was declined. He was appointed as a member of the State Council. In 1868, he moved to Paris, France, where he lived until his death in 1881, visiting Russia only occasionally to participate in the State Council meetings. Memory Monument to Muravyov-Amursky in Khabarovsk as depicted on the 5000 ruble banknote In 1891, a bronze statue of Muravyov was erected on one of the Amur River's cliffs near Khabarovsk. In 1929, it was taken off and replaced with a statue of Lenin, which stood there until 1989. The Muravyov-Amursky memorial was restored in 1993. In 1992, the remains of Muravyov-Amursky were brought from Paris to be re-buried in the central part of Vladivostok, which stands on the Muravyov-Amursky Peninsula, named after this statesman. In 2012 a bronze statue of the governor was installed over the tomb, overlooking the Zolotoy Rog bay, which he visited in 1850s. The Khabarovsk monument‚Äîalong with the Khabarovsk Bridge over the Amur River‚Äîis depicted on the 5000 ruble banknote issued by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation on July 31, 2006.

She was built by Armstrong at Newcastle-on-Tyne, with the keel being laid down on 23 September 1918. She was launched on 19 May 1920 and commissioned 14 January 1926. History Emerald went out to the East Indies, 4th Cruiser Squadron, on commissioning, finally returning home to pay off on 15 July 1933. During her time in the far east she participated as part of a Royal Navy flotilla in the 1927 Nanking Incident, helping to protect British and other international citizens and business interests. After a refit at Chatham, the ship recommissioned for the East Indies again on 31 August 1934, which tour lasted until September 1937, on relief by . On her return home she paid off to reserve. Recommissioned for war service, she joined the 12th Cruiser Squadron on Northern Patrol duties in September 1939. However, the appearance of German raiders in the Atlantic resulted in her transfer to Halifax in October to escort homeward-bound convoys, where she remained into 1940. During the early part of the war, until May 1940, her captain was the noted officer Augustus Agar, V.C.. On 24 June 1940 Emerald departed Greenock carrying ¬£58 million in gold, and reached Halifax on 1 July where the gold was transferred to a Canadian National Railway train for safe storage in Canada until the threat of German invasion of England had passed. Her sister ship shipped another ¬£10 million for Operation Fish. In 1941 Emerald was transferred to the Indian Ocean, where she escorted troop convoys to the Middle East and stood by in the Persian Gulf during the operations in Iraq in April 1941. After Japan's entry into the war, in December 1941, Emerald joined the Eastern Fleet as part of the 'Fast Group', and in March 1942 was flagship. In August 1942 the ship returned home to refit at Portsmouth, and did not return to service until early April 1943.

Retrieved 2013-12-01. Gaelic: Cuimridh; Pictish: Aberlednock; Latin: Victoria) is a village and parish in the southern Highlands of Scotland, towards the western end of the Strathearn district of Perth and Kinross, west of Crieff. Comrie is a historic conservation village, situated in a national scenic area around the river Earn. Its position on the Highland Boundary Fault accounts for it experiencing more earth tremors than anywhere else in Britain. The parish is twinned with Carleton Place, Ontario, Canada. Location and etymology Comrie lies within the registration county of Perthshire (Gaelic: Siorrachd Pheairt) and the Perth and Kinross local council area. The name Comrie is derived from the original Gaelic name con-ruith or comh-ruith (from con/comh 'together', and ruith \\"to run\\", \\"running\\") translating literally as \\"running together\\", but more accurately as \\"flowing together\\" or \\"the place where rivers meet\\". In modern Gaelic the name is more often transcribed as Comraidh, Cuimridh or Cuimrigh. This is an apt toponym as the village sits at the confluence of three rivers. The River Ruchill (Gaelic: An Ruadh Thuill, The Red Flood) and The River Lednock (Gaelic: An Leathad Cnoc, The Wooded Knoll) are all tributaries of the Earn (Gaelic: Uisge Dubh- √àireann) at Comrie, which itself eventually feeds into the Tay (Gaelic: Uisge Tatha). Due to its position astride the Highland Boundary Fault, Comrie experiences frequent earth tremors and has an old nickname of \\"Shaky Toun/Toon\\" (Scots) or 'Am Baile Critheanach' (Gaelic). In the 1830s around 7,300 tremors were recorded and today Comrie records earth tremors more often and to a higher intensity than anywhere else in the United Kingdom.Moorlandschool.co.uk Comrie became the site of one of the world's first seismometers in 1840, and a functional replica is still housed in the Earthquake House in The Ross in Comrie.Comrie Earthquake House The position of Comrie on the Highland Boundary Fault also gives the village a claim to the contested title of Gateway to the Highlands. To the north of the village, Ben Chonzie and the Grampian Mountains rise majestically, while to the south of the village broad open moorland is joined by lesser mountains and glens that provide a wide range of terrain and ecology. History Bridge of Ross, ca. 1890 - 1900. There is significant evidence of prehistoric habitation of the area, marked by numerous standing stones and archaeological remains that give insight into the original prehistoric, Pictish and later Celtic societies that lived here. In AD 79, the Roman General Agricola chose what are now the outskirts of Comrie as the site for a fort and temporary marching camp, due to the area's strategic position on the southern fringe of the Highlands. It is one of the line of so-called \\"Glen blocking\\" forts running from Drumquhassle to Stracathro and including the legionary fortress of Inchtuthil. The temporary camp was c. 22 acre (c. 9 ha) in size. An infamous battle between the Celts and Romans is known to have occurred on the unidentified mountain Mons Graupius. The area around Comrie, Strathearn, is one of several proposed battle sites. James V of Scotland came to Comrie and Cultybraggan regularly in September to hunt deer. Records survive of the food he consumed included bread, ale and fish sent from Sterling.Excerpta e libris domicilii Domini Jacobi Quinti regis Scotorum (Edinburgh, 1836), pp. 230-231, appendix p. 32: More details of hunting visits to Cultybraggan by James V are in National Records of Scotland E32 series. Comrie's early prosperity derived from weaving. This was mostly done as domestic piecework. Comrie was also important as a droving town. Cattle destined for the markets of the Scottish Lowlands and ultimately England would be driven south from their grazing areas in the Highlands. River crossings, such as at Comrie, were important staging posts on the way south. Much of the land around Comrie was owned by the Drummond family, Earls of Perth, latterly Earls of Ancaster, whose main seat was Drummond Castle, south of Crieff. Another branch of the Drummonds owned Drummondernoch (Gaelic: Drumainn √àireannach ‚Äì Drummond of Ireland), to the west of the town. Aberuchill Castle, however, just outside Comrie was originally a Campbell seat. Over the years the village has grown to incorporate many smaller satellite settlements, including The Ross (Gaelic: An Ros) a small settlement to the west of the village contained within a river peninsula (An Ros literally translates as peninsula) which became more accessible when the Ross Bridge was constructed in 1792. Before that the peninsula was only reached by a river ford. Similarly, the once isolated communities in the surrounding glens and mountains, such as Invergeldie in Glen Lednock and Dalchruin in Glen Artney, have generally come to be seen as part of Comrie village. Previously, they existed as small isolated settlements ‚Äì for instance, Glen Lednock contained 21 different settlements of 350 individual structures and 25 corn-drying kilns. However, these exclusively Gaelic-speaking hamlets were largely eviscerated by the Highland Clearances of the 18th and 19th centuries. Comrie underwent something of a renaissance in the early 19th century and Victorian periods as an attractive location for wealthy residents and visitors, an image which has been maintained to this day. This popularity helped to bring the railway in 1893, when the Caledonian Railway completed a branch line from Crieff. The line was later extended to meet the Callander and Oban Railway at Lochearnhead. The Comrie‚ÄìLochearnheadline was closed in 1951 and the Comrie‚ÄìCrieff line in 1964, due largely to the improved road network in the area. Comrie's mountainous setting with abundant streams and lochs brought a number of hydro-electric power plants into the area in the earlier 20th century. A dam was built in Glen Lednock and water piped to another plant from Loch Earn in the west. Today Comrie is an attractive retirement village, recording the largest proportion of over-65s in Scotland in the 1991 census. Its economy is supplemented by adventure and wildlife tourism. As with other Highland villages, recent decades have seen an influx of \\"relocated residents\\", white settlers, predominantly from England and the Scottish central belt. Being primarily middle-class, this has encouraged a number of buy-to-let and second- home purchases and developments, which has engendered the erosion of local culture and traditions, and exhaustion of the housing stock for young locals. The result has been a high degree of disrespect and distain of the original residents by \\"incomers\\". Sights and culture =Architecture= The White Church, the former parish kirk, is Comrie's most striking building, with a prominent tower and spire by the roadside of the ancient churchyard at the heart of the village. This is an early Christian site, dedicated to an obscure early saint, Kessog or Mokessog, who may have flourished in the 8th century. Comrie Parish Church is of a grand Gothic style, disproportionate to anything else in the village dominates the distant skyline. It was designed and built in 1881 by George T Ewing. Comrie is also graced by a little-known Charles Rennie Mackintosh building, a shop in the main street with a first floor corner turret built in a version of the Scottish vernacular style (not visible in the above illustration). Some of the buildings and homes in the village date back centuries, with many traditional Highland cottages built in dry- stone and/or clay and originally roofed in thatch. In the higher mountain glens around the village, traditional Highland blackhouses, most now in ruins, can also be found. There are a number of grand estate homes and historic castles in the area. For the most part, however, the main quadrants of the village house Victorian and Edwardian buildings, including many large detached villas and small terraces. The newer parts of the village are dominated by modern properties from the 1950s onward, including extremely modern properties of varying character. =Awards= The village won the Royal Horticultural Society \\"Large Village Britain in Bloom award\\" in 2007 and 2010. Comrie also won awards in the 2009 Beautiful Scotland Campaign, including Best VillageBeautiful Scotland Winner 2009 and a special award for Continuous Community Involvement. In 2013 Comrie won gold in the village category of the Beautiful Scotland Awards and a special Community Horticulture Award. =Glen Lednock, The Monument and the Deil's Cauldron= River Lednock passing through De'il's Cauldron located at Ordnance Survey 1:25,000 scale Explorer map series, sheets 309-470 A granite obelisk atop D√πn M√≤r (English: Great Hill) to the north commemorates Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville.

The trail begins in the village, at Laggan Park (Gaelic: An L√†gan M√≤r ‚Äì The Great Basin) and ascends through a native forest of pines, oak, elm, ash rowan, alder and beech to Glen Lednock. Via The Shaky Bridge (although the original shaky bridge was replaced with a decidedly less shaky successor), hikers are treated to a splendid view of the glen, a truly Highland landscape, where a single-lane road leads up to Glen Lednock Reservoir and the Munro, Ben Chonzie. From there D√πn M√≤r and the Monument are easily reached, offering unparalleled views across Strathearn and further west to the central Highlands. A swift descent (or ascent depending on the route chosen) leads through a long, steep, wooded gorge containing the impressive De'il's Cauldron. Here the river has cut a high, cascading waterfall in the surrounding rock, with pools below resembling a boiling cauldron. It is said that a water-elf, Uris-chidh, lives here and tries to lure victims into the treacherous waters. The path down leads to a lesser companion to the great falls, The Wee Cauldron, with a calmer view of the river. The path through the forest eventually returns to the village. =Prisoner-of-war camp= Nissen huts at the former prisoner of war campTo the south of the village is a military camp at nearby Cultybraggan. During World War II, this was POW Camp 21Prisoner of War Camps (1939 ‚Äì 1948), English Heritage 2003. for Italian and later German prisoners of war. This was a \\"black\\" camp as most of its inmates were ardent Nazis. It became infamous after anti-Nazi German POW Wolfgang Rosterg was lynched there by fellow inmates, who were hanged after the war for the act. Many more difficult Nazis were moved to POW Camp 165 at Watten in Caithness. The camp grounds have a two-storey nuclear bunker (Cultybraggan RGHQ), the proposed site for a provincial Scottish government in case of nuclear attack. Even in the 1990s the bunker had accommodation, a telephone exchange, a sewage plant and a BBC studio.Subterranea Britannica Cultybraggan RGHQ In 2007 a local community trust bought the camp and the surrounding of land, under Land Reform legislation, for the sum of ¬£350,000. In December 2016 Heinrich Steinmeyer, a former Waffen-SS prisoner of the camp until 1948, left Comrie ¬£384,000 in his will, as an expression of \\"my gratitude to the people of Scotland for the kindness and generosity that I have experienced in Scotland during my imprisonment of war and hereafter.\\" A local trust manages the legacy.http://comriedevelopmenttrust.org.uk =Notable sights= *Ben Chonzie (Gaelic: Beinn a' Ch√≤innich) ‚Äì a mountain and Munro that overlooks the village, famous for its many mountain hares *Cultybraggan (Gaelic: possibly Cul taigh bracan) ‚Äì an ancient farming site, and site of the once-secret underground nuclear bunker *Linn a' chullaich (English: Pool of the Boar) ‚Äì a deep freshwater pool still commonly used for wild swimming in the summer months, known locally as The Lynn *The Deil's Cauldron (Gaelic: Slocha'n Donish, English: The Devil's Kettle) ‚Äì a deep rock waterfall where there resides a legendary water-elf called Uris-chidh, who lures victims to a watery death *The Earthquake House (Gaelic: An taigh crith-fuinn) ‚Äì a small research station housing one of the world's first seismometers, still active today *Tullichettle (Gaelic: Tulach a' chadal, English: The knoll/mound of sleep) ‚Äì an ancient churchyard *Auchingarrich (Gaelic: Achadh an g√†radh, English: Field of the garden) ‚Äì An ancient farming site.

The railway to Perth was closed in 1964 by British Railways under the Beeching cuts. Flambeaux parade and Hogmanay Hogmanay flambeaux fire festival with the white church visible in background Comrie has a curious Hogmanay ritual: on the stroke of midnight, a torchlight procession marches through the village. Traditionally the procession involves the twelve strongest men of the village carrying long, thick birch poles, to which burning tarred rags are attached and taken to each of the four corners of the village. The procession is usually accompanied by the village pipe band and villagers with floats and dressed in costume. After the procession the torches are thrown from the Dalginross Bridge into the River Earn. The origins of the ceremony are unclear. It is generally assumed to have pre-Christian Celtic or possibly Pictish roots and to be intended to cleanse the village of evil spirits in advance of the new year (albeit the new year's commencing in January is a relatively modern convention). The use of the birch tree specifically may have significance as the first letter of the Celtic Ogham alphabet, and a symbol of new beginning. The spectacle attracts thousands of visitors to the small highland village each Hogmanay. A countdown to midnight is usually held at Melville Square and after the processions people gather here again for traditional Scottish music and dancing. Drinking alcohol in the street is commonplace and tolerated. Parties in village homes are common and other Scottish Hogmanay traditions like first footing are also observed. Comrie Fortnight An annual two-week festival, called the Comrie Fortnight, is held in the village during July and August. The Comrie Fortnight started in the late 1960s and has evolved over the years, now consisting of a wide range of activities including competitions, outings, dances and a float parade. Profits from the Comrie Fortnight are used to support events and groups in the local community. Language Today the principal languages of Comrie are English, Gaelic and Scots. Historically, Comrie and the surrounding area were part of the G√†idhealtachd. A 1799 statistical account of Comrie Parish states, \\"The common language of the people is Gaelic and all the natives understand it; but many, especially the old, do not understand English.\\" Gaelic appears to have remained the primary language in the early part of the 19th century, as testified by this 1828 passage by Mr Mushet, local minister at the time, describing the annual celebration of the sacrament of the lord's supper: \\"The Lord favoured us (blessed be His name) with fair and seasonable weather. We had near eleven tables in Irish (Gaelic). Each table contained forty-eight persons or thereabout, and we had only two tables and some few persons at the third in English\\". As with the rest of Scotland however, the process of language shift away from Gaelic and towards English, facilitated by the Highland Clearances and the Education (Scotland) Act of 1872, was apparently well established by the late 19th century. Indeed, by 1891 census estimates suggested that only 17.9 per cent of Comrie's population were native Gaelic speakers.Linguae-celticae.org In 1901 only 8.3 per cent of the population were native Gaelic speakers, while only 4.5 per cent had Gaelic as their sole language. The most recent census data for 2002 shows that less than 5 per cent are Gaelic speakers. The decline of Gaelic in the area can be attributed largely to The Highland Clearances (Scottish Gaelic: Fuadach nan G√†idheal) in the 18th and 19th centuries, which saw people in the smaller satellite settlements of the village (located in the surrounding mountains and glens) forcibly displaced from their homes, and many forced to emigrate to Canada, Australasia and North America. In addition, the Education (Scotland) Act of 1872 led to generations of Gaels forbidden from speaking their native language in the classroom, and punished for doing so. As with the rest of Scotland (excluding the north-west), Gaelic speakers have struggled to retain their language through the generations, though Comrie retains a larger than average number of speakers.

The sketches were a recurring feature on the program between 1996 and 1998, and were written by cast member Will Ferrell and then-head writer Adam McKay. The sketch made a reappearance on the show on December 7, 2013, during which Ferrell made a guest appearance, as the episode was guest-hosted by his Anchorman 2 co-star Paul Rudd.  Format  The format of the sketches resembles the improv game \\"Two Describe a Third.\\" Three or four friends (known as the \\"Bill Brasky Buddies\\") gather in a public place to drink Scotch, smoke cigars, and loudly reminisce about their mutual acquaintance Bill Brasky. The Brasky Buddies are all apparently businessmen who worked with Brasky. They all have red cheeks, red noses, and big white teeth. They appear to be coming from a business conference, and are already very drunk. The discussions begin with an agreement that \\"Bill Brasky is a son of a bitch,\\" at which point the Buddies proceed to tell tall tales of Brasky's superhuman feats, usually focused on his huge size, virility, celebrity connections, amazing tolerance for drugs and alcohol, and reckless disregard for human life. If their stories are to be believed, Brasky is enormously tall and heavy, superhumanly tough, can eat anything, has numerous affairs, and has killed and maimed many people. All of the salesmen have been his victim at one time or another, but they are all celebrated with the same gusto. At regular intervals, they raise their glasses to toast him, shouting \\"To Bill Brasky!\\" Typically, the three cycle through the same genres of comment four or five times. The first buddy will begin a long anecdote about Brasky, interrupted by the second drunkenly blurting out something embarrassing (e.g. \\"I'm wearing a diaper\\"). The buddies then exchange several shorter claims about Brasky. The cycle will then repeat, starting with the second Brasky Buddy, getting more outrageous each time around. At some point another man, usually Tim Meadows, will interject with \\"Are you guys talking about Bill Brasky? I know Bill Brasky!\\" and be welcomed into the group. Some sketches end with Brasky's appearance via a forced perspective shot that makes him look like a giant.

With Ana Gasteyer as a Parent. #* The original live broadcast of this sketch was severely truncated, with the last 2‚Äì3 minutes of the sketch being cut off. Shortly before the closing shot with the forced-perspective shot of Brasky, the three Brasky Buddies can be seen struggling through their lines, presumably due to lack of cue cards. After the sketch ended, there was an impromptu 45-second shot of the SNL band to fill time, before the last commercial break and goodnights. It is unknown why this sketch was cut short, but it is likely because there was a time discrepancy. There was only about 45 seconds in the goodnights, which would explain why the last few minutes of the sketch were abruptly cut off. In reruns, this edition of the sketch was replaced with the full-length dress rehearsal version. # \\"A.A. Meeting\\" (unaired) (October 25, 1997) Bill Brasky Buddies: Will Ferrell (as Hank), Chris Farley (as Frank), Norm Macdonald. With Ana Gasteyer and Tim Meadows as A.A. members. #* During the rehearsal, Farley's large fake teeth fall out twice and he later stumbles over his lines. This sketch was cut after dress rehearsal and never made it into the live show. However, fragments of the unaired dress rehearsal sketch were later released on Saturday Night Live: The Best of Chris Farley and the full sketch was made available on Yahoo! Screen. But then Yahoo! Screen was taken down and the full skit is once again missing. # \\"Bull & Bear\\" (December 12, 1998) Bill Brasky Buddies: Alec Baldwin, John Goodman (as Ted), Will Ferrell (as Hank). With Ana Gasteyer and Andy Murphy as patrons. # \\"Chuck E. Cheese's\\" (December 7, 2013) Bill Brasky Buddies: Will Ferrell (as Hank), David Koechner, Paul Rudd, Taran Killam, Kenan Thompson. With Cecily Strong as a waitress. In addition to the Bill Brasky sketches, a sketch that followed a very similar format called \\"Mr. Willoughby\\" appeared on the January 14, 2006 episode of SNL. Framed as a trailer for a movie based on a lost Jane Austen novel of the same title, the sketch featured Rachel Dratch, Tina Fey and host Scarlett Johansson as a trio of Victorian sisters rhapsodizing about one Mr. Willoughby, \\"the most eligible bachelor in all of Upper Cornholeshire.\\" Like the Brasky Buddies' stories, the sisters' descriptions of Willoughby steadily grow more and more bizarre, and they recount even the most repugnant facts (\\"His teeth are like sharp pieces of corn!\\") with an attitude of lovestruck awe. At several points the three sisters sigh, \\"Mr. Willoughby!\\" in unison, much like the Brasky Buddies' periodic toasts of \\"To Bill Brasky!\\"  See also  * Chuck Norris facts * The Most Interesting Man in the World * Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon References Category:Fictional salespeople Category:Saturday Night Live sketches Category:Saturday Night Live characters Category:Television characters introduced in 1996 Category:Saturday Night Live in the 1990s ","title":"Bill Brasky"},{"id":"2079895","text":"Jacopo Zabolino or Zabolini, also known by Giacomo Vincioli (active 1461 ‚Äì 1494) was an Italian painter active in the late 15th century in Spoleto.

The horse is to appear to be a \\"pleasure\\" to ride and very comfortable, while being very smooth. Most light horse breeds in the United States and Canada may compete in western pleasure classes, either in open competition or at shows limited to a single breed. However, horse conformation and temperament play a role in this event, and hence animals that are calm, quiet, have collected, soft gaits and the strong muscling required to sustain slow, controlled movement are the most competitive. Breeds Nearly any breed can be exhibited in western pleasure classes. The highest levels of competition are usually in shows restricted to a single breed, but at lower levels, there are open classes where multiple breeds may compete against one another. Across all breeds, horses are generally to move in a slow, light, calm, relaxed manner, with minimal rein contact. The desired \\"frame,\\" or style, of the horse may vary from breed to breed. In open or all-breed competition, stock horse breeds such as the American Quarter Horse, American Paint Horse and Appaloosa tend to be favored by the judges, though quality individuals from other breeds such as the Morgan horse and Arabian horse can be competitive if not penalized for their natural conformation that gives them a somewhat higher-set neck. \\"Gaited\\" breeds such as the Missouri Fox Trotter and the Tennessee Walker often have their own Western Pleasure classes with standards adapted to evaluate their use of intermediate gaits other than the jog trot. Even breeds that are traditionally shown mostly in English riding disciplines, such as the American Saddlebred or the Friesian, may offer western pleasure classes with judging specifications that are adapted to the conformation and way of going of those breeds.Friesian Grand National Amateur Western Pleasure Class 2005. Some breeds allow or encourage a higher head carriage than is seen in traditional stock horse breed competition =Stock breeds= The stock horse breeds are shown with a style referred to as a \\"level top line.\\" Their movement is described as \\"daisy cutting,\\" as they have very little knee action, but their hindquarters are actively engaged and their hocks reach well under the body. They carry their neck nearly level with their withers, and head just slightly in front of vertical, but are to be penalized if their poll is carried lower than their withers. The head and neck move very little at any gait. They are exhibited with little to no bit contact and a loop in the rein. The style used to show these horses is derived from the \\"Texas\\" cowboy tradition. =Saddle type breeds= \\"Saddle type\\" horses encompass a large group of horse breeds of many sizes and body types that have an arched and high-set neck and naturally greater knee action. They are shown in a style derived from the \\"California\\" vaquero cowboy tradition, particularly that of the finished spade bit horse. They are to show with a lightly arched neck, their heads relatively low and tucked to be almost exactly perpendicular to the ground, with horses overflexed or going \\"behind the bit\\" to be penalized. Though a self-carried horse is desired, with minimal bit contact and a draped rein visible, this effect is often achieved by use of weighted reins, as by nature they are ridden with somewhat more contact and have more forward motion than the stock type. The Arabian and Morgan breeds produce horses specially bred for the western disciplines and offer western pleasure classes that draw large numbers of competitors. Breeds such as the American Saddlebred or Friesian have smaller numbers competing in western competition than other events, but classes are available. Most gaited horses fall into the saddle type category in terms of desired frame and style, though judging criteria for their gaits differs significantly from that of non-gaited breeds. Equipment A western saddle suitable for show. A western show bridle with silver ornamentation on headstall and bit. Horses and riders show in western tack and attire. The horse carries a western saddle, and wears an open-faced bridle without a noseband. The rider wears a long-sleeved shirt, sometimes with a vest or jacket, chaps, a cowboy hat, and cowboy boots. Gloves and spurs are optional. Shirts and vests or jackets are often brightly colored and sometimes elaborately decorated to mimic popular styles in western wear. Riders at smaller shows usually wear denim jeans under their chaps, while at regional and national competitions, western-styled polyester dress pants that match the rider's shirt or chaps are worn by women, while men tend to stick to jeans. Men usually wear a neckscarf, often of silk, and women may too wear a neckscarf, but in recent years as rules have been relaxed, brooches and necklaces are now also seen on female riders. Show grooming A mane that has been banded for western classes at a horse show While all western pleasure horses are to be clean (generally bathed prior to a show) and well groomed, with legs, bridle path, ears, muzzle, and other areas neatly clipped, grooming details vary by breed. Length of bridle path is usually determined by breed, with longer-necked breeds usually sporting a longer bridle path than the stock horse breeds. Casual observers will mostly notice breed differences in the style of the horse's mane. Though fads vary a bit from year to year, in the stock horse breeds, the mane is usually shortened and thinned, often \\"banded,\\" in that the mane is divided into many small segments and small rubber bands are placed around each segment in order to make the overall mane lay flat and neat. However, in some years, long manes have been \\"in,\\" and in other years a thinned mane with a braided forelock or a few small braids in the front of the mane has been popular. Arabians and Morgans are less prone to fads as they have long been required to show with \\"natural\\" long, unthinned, unbanded, unbraided manes. Gaited breeds and Saddlebreds usually sport the same mane style in both English pleasure and western pleasure classes, long and flowing but with a colorful ribbon braided into the forelock and into the front section of the mane. Tails are usually kept relatively long and flowing for nearly all breeds. Artificial tails or tail extensions are often allowed, though are banned for Arabians and Morgans, where a full tail is a breed trait. Class procedure and requirements Competitor attire The riders compete as a group at the same time, traveling around the outer edge of the arena. All contestants, at the command of the event's judge, are asked to have their horse walk, jog (a slow trot), and lope both directions in an arena, as well as to stand quietly and back up readily. In addition, many judges will ask for extended gaits, particularly an extended jog and, in some breeds, the hand gallop. Winning horses are decided on their quality of movement, proper behavior, form in motion, and calm manner. As stated in the show rules of the American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA), \\"maximum credit should be given to the flowing, balanced and willing horse which gives the appearance of being fit and a pleasure to ride.\\"AQHA The Western Division of the United States Equestrian Federation (USEF) has similar requirements. Faults are assessed on infractions such as excessive speed or slowness, breaking gait, or incorrect head position.AQHA World Senior Western Pleasure Final Nov 2006. Some horses in this clip are carrying their poll below the withers; the ideal is that the poll is no lower than the withers.) According to the American Paint Horse Association rule book, in judging western pleasure, credit is to be given to the horse that under light control and without intimidation goes forward with comfort, self-carriage, confidence, willingness, and a balanced, fluid stride. To evaluate these things a judge should look for these six characteristics: cadence and rhythm, top line and expression, consistency and length of stride, in that order. Cadence is defined as: The accuracy of a horse's footfalls at any given gait. Rhythm is defined as: The speed of those footfalls at any given gait. The Topline: The head and neck should be carried in a relaxed natural position, compatible with the horse's conformation. The head should not be carried behind the vertical, giving the appearance of intimidation or be excessively nosed out, giving a resistant appearance. Expression should have a pleasant look with clear, bright eyes and a willing attitude. Consistency is defined as the ability to maintain the same top line, cadence and rhythm in each gait throughout the class. Length of stride should be of a reasonable length in relation to that horse's conformation with a full extension of the limbs. The winner of any western pleasure class should be the horse that best combines these six characteristics. Cadence and rhythm should always be first and most important in evaluating a western pleasure horse. The Western Pleasure rider's seat is deep, with a long stirrup, to assist the horse in driving deeply from the rear and elevating the shoulders. Reins are kept loose and relaxed, though quiet and subtle rein signals are still used. While equitation of the rider is not judged in a pleasure class, a properly positioned rider will obtain a better performance from the horse. Controversies Western pleasure competition, like any event, has controversies and situations where fads become so extreme as to possibly constitute abuse. Therefore, most organizations that sanction horse shows have strict rules to prevent the worst problems. Nonetheless, it is hard to regulate fads, and horse show sanctioning organizations usually tout education of judges as the best method available to prevent fads from escalating into more serious problems. Because western pleasure emphasis calmness and manners, some individuals attempt to circumvent good training by using tranquilizers to steady their horses. However, drug rules of both the AQHA and USEF are strict, and both owners and trainers of horses that test positive for drugs are sanctioned heavily. =Tail deadening= Another abusive practice that is penalized if discovered is the process of \\"nerving\\" the horse's tail. If a horse is bored and irritable, it will express its displeasure by swishing its tail vigorously. Horses who are shown too long and schooled too repetitively can become \\"ring sour,\\" a term used to describe a horse with a bored, unhappy and irritable manner, and often a ring sour horse will flatten its ears and swish its tail every time it is given a command. Because tail swishing is penalized, some competitors resorted to cutting the nerves in a ring sour horse's tail to prevent the tail from moving. Because this also keeps the horse from brushing away flies, leaving it helpless against biting insects, the practice was quickly banned, and horses with nerved tails are no longer allowed in the show ring. However, some competitors still resort to temporarily numbing the tail with drugs, alcohol injections , or by mechanical means. All methods are illegal if discovered but, as no scars remain, can be difficult to spot. The practice of nerving the tail was less of a problem in breeds where a high-carried tail is a breed trait, though temporarily numbing the tail is not completely unknown even in these breeds. =\\"Headset\\" trends= The sport of western pleasure has been criticized on account of an extremely low head position many judges were favoring in the stock horse breeds, known as the \\"peanut roller.\\" In this head set, horses carry their heads with the poll far below the level of their withers. This is a problem because it also forced the horse to travel at an extremely slow pace on the \\"forehand\\" (carrying too much weight on their front legs instead of rocking it correctly back onto their hind legs). Over long periods of time, moving in this highly artificial frame can cause soundness problems in some horses, and even a sound horse cannot properly bring its hindquarters under its body when traveling forward. This fad and its problems created a poor view of the discipline as a whole, especially by competitors in other equestrian sports. The industry has adjusted its rules to penalize the \\"peanut roller\\" fad, though excessively low head positions are still seen at times. In the USEF, included a requirement that a horse must have its poll no lower than the height of its withers, or, in the case of the AQHA, a rule stating that the ideal gait shall be performed with a \\"level topline.\\" Additional rules make an extreme headset more difficult by asking exhibitors to extend gaits during a class. In the case of the AQHA, videos were sent out to all licensed judges to demonstrate what was and was not correct, and the materials also made available to the general public. =Spur stop controversy= A new fad, seen in nearly all breeds, requires a horse to perform with an extremely loose, draped rein at all times. Western pleasure horses have always traveled on a fairly loose rein, but in recent years the visible \\"drape\\" in the rein has become exaggerated.2006 US Arabian Western Pleasure Open Final. Horses in this clip are shown with the extreme rein drape] However, it requires time, good riding ability, and careful training to correctly teach a horse \\"self carriage,\\" particularly to slow or stop by responding to only a rider's use of seat position (and sometimes voice) without tightening the reins.Gollehon, Robin with Alana Harrison. \\"Team Horse & Rider Private Lesson with Robin Gollehon.\\" Web page accessed January 43, 2007 Thus, an alternative method of training to slow a horse down without the use of the reins gave rise to a new, highly controversial, technique known as the \\"spur stop,\\" an unconventional method used by some trainers to train horses to slow down and stop when spur pressure is applied. Because spur, heel or leg pressure is generally used to ask a horse to go faster, this technique is sometimes referred to by its critics as \\"riding the brake\\" and is frowned upon by several major western pleasure sanctioning organizations since at least 2003, when AQHA put out a series of videos on correct and incorrect style and way of going for western pleasure horses, showing a \\"hit list\\" of undesirable traits not to be rewarded in the show ring, with the spur stop leading the list.Wells, Cleve. \\"Riding the New Lope\\" This controversy in Western Pleasure circles resembles the debate over Rollkur in the field of dressage, particularly over the question of whether the practice constitutes animal abuse. Experts differ on the validity of the spur stop. As stated by trainer Bob Avila: \\"the spur stop is ‚Äúthe worst thing ever invented. If I were to get a horse in for training that had a spur stop on him, I could do one event on him, period: Western pleasure.‚Äù Taking the opposing view, Mark Sheridan, an AQHA judge and trainer, has said: \\"You should not have any problems with the spur stop, and the transition to whatever events you decide to do with [the horse]. Personally, I put a spur stop on just the stop and back, on my western riders.\\" A less extreme method is referred to as putting \\"buttons\\" on the horse. A \\"button\\" is simply a leg or spur position that is trained by operant conditioning that tells the horse to travel at a particular gait or speed. These are often highly customized to an individual horse and rider team. While less extreme than the spur stop, such techniques still take the horse away from traditional responses to the riding aids of seat, hands, weight and voice, which can also lead to an excessively artificial way of going by the animal.

The stable lasted until August 1998 and was revived briefly in World Wrestling Entertainment during the summer of 2005. During the time period of 2010 and 2015 they have made several appearances in various local house shows. History =Extreme Championship Wrestling (1996‚Äì1998)= Since July 1996, Stevie Richards (Michael Manna) and The Blue Meanie (Brian Heffron) had been making parodies of various wrestlers from the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) and World Championship Wrestling (WCW). In early 1996 Raven was forming a stable called Raven's Nest and was gathering new members. He called upon Stevie and Meanie along with an independent performer from New Jersey, Nova (Mike Bucci). These three would often come to the ring together before Raven made his entrance, imitating rock bands or pop culture references, most notably The Jackson 5 and at The Doctor Is In in August 1996 as the rock band KISS. The latter received a great ovation from the ECW fans before The Sandman abruptly entered the ring and caned them. Backstage after the event, Buh Buh Ray Dudley told them how great it was and the only thing greater would be a parody of the nWo. After clearing things with Paul Heyman and Raven, it was decided that they would form the bWo at the next big event, November to Remember '96. Over the next few months, members were added and members left just like the group they were imitating. Initially meant to be a one off parody, the Blue World Order became immensely popular and elevated Richards to the main event level in ECW. Hollywood Nova The height of the bWo's success came at the first ECW pay per view, Barely Legal. The event saw the debut of bWo Japan (with members Taka Michinoku, Terry Boy, and Dick Togo), and Big Stevie Cool was part of the 3-Way Dance main event for the #1 contendership for the ECW World Title. Just weeks after this event Richards suffered a severe injury to his neck courtesy of Terry Funk and a metal guardrail which left him temporarily paralyzed for over an hour. In July 1997, Nova had a match against Taz in which Taz vowed to kill the bWo. He squashed Nova, and although Meanie and Nova continued to tag over the next few months, the bWo was indeed dead in November 1998. =World Wrestling Entertainment (2005)= The bWo reunited in 2005 at WWE's ECW reunion show, ECW One Night Stand, coming to the ring before the Dudley Boyz versus Tommy Dreamer and The Sandman match. During their entrance, Joey Styles (laughing hysterically once they entered) said that \\"If any gimmick never deserved to make a dime and made a boatload of cash, this is it! And the best part is that they (WCW) couldn't sue us, 'cause it's a parody!\\" On the July 7, 2005 episode of SmackDown!, the bWo reunited once again, this time to confront JBL. During the group brawl at the end of ECW One Night Stand, JBL sought out The Blue Meanie and legitimately assaulted him after Meanie called him a \\"backstage bully\\". The attack by JBL caused Meanie to tear some recent stitches and bleed. JBL then taunted the bWo and called Meanie a \\"fat little bitch\\". This led to a Meanie versus JBL no-disqualification match. Richards delivered a stiff chairshot to JBL during the match that busted him open. The Blue Meanie won the match after he hit his finisher, the Meaniesault, and Batista ran in and gave a spinebuster to JBL and threw an out-of-it Meanie on top of JBL. Later, the bWo challenged The Mexicools to a match at The Great American Bash, with Stevie Richards saying the bWo was tired of the Mexicools interfering in people's matches, saying they were going to take over and rise up against the gringos because \\"We invented that!\\" - which then prompted Hollywood Nova to say \\"Actually, we never said we were going to rise up against the gringos\\". The three members appeared on WWE Velocity in a six-man tag match against 3 jobbers to prepare themselves for their tag match against the Mexicools. At The Great American Bash, the bWo and Mexicools met in a six-man tag match. They even drove into the ring on tricycles to parody the Mexicools' usual ring entrance on John Deere lawnmowers. The bWo lost the match after Super Crazy hit a moonsault and Psicosis hit the guillotine legdrop on Big Stevie Cool for the win. As the month of July ended, the bWo faded from the scene. Stevie Richards went back to his old gimmick, as did Hollywood Nova, while Blue Meanie was never officially contracted by WWE. =Sporadic reunions (2008‚Äì2010, 2015, 2017)= There were some bWo reunions in later years in different independents. When Richards went to TNA, Bucci and Heffron took part in a couple of shows. On April 18, 2009 Nova and Blue Meanie unsuccessfully challenged for the British promotion One Pro Wrestling tag-team titles, losing to Project Ego (Kris Travis and Martin Kirby). That was Bucci's first in-ring performance in nearly 3 years. On June 27, 2009 they appeared with many other former ECW talent at the Francine Fournier-run benefit show entitled Legends of The Arena. The event took place at the original ECW Arena in South Philadelphia as a benefit for deceased members of Francine's family; a portion of the ticket sales went to The American Cancer Society. bWo defeated the team of Little Guido and Big Sal, The Full Blooded Italians. On December 12, 2009 Nova and Meanie took part in the International Wrestling Cartel show Full Circle in Elizabeth, Pennsylvania. They united with Shane Douglas and defeated local stars Frank Stalletto, Lord Zoltan and Lou Marconi. On August 8, 2010 the bWo reunited on the TNA PPV Hardcore Justice. Heffron couldn't attend the show due to personal responsibilities to take care of in Philadelphia prior to going on his vacation the next day; still, his promo was aired on PPV and in the arena he was replaced by Big Tilly. Steve Richards, accompanied by Nova and Tilly, defeated Peter Polaco and later in the night Tilly and Nova attacked Tommy Dreamer during his match with Raven. On June 29, 2015, the Chikara promotion announced that Big Stevie Cool, Da Blue Guy and Hollywood Nova would be reuniting as the Blue World Order for the 2015 King of Trios tournament. They were eliminated from the tournament in their first round match on September 4 by the Devastation Corporation (Blaster McMassive, Flex Rumblecrunch and Max Smashmaster). On March 30, 2017, the bWo made a one-night reunion at WrestleCon in a six-man tag team match, defeating the team of Kevin Matthews, Mario Bokara and Pat Buck.

Vampire films have been a staple since the era of silent films, so much so that the depiction of vampires in popular culture is strongly based upon their depiction in films throughout the years. The most popular cinematic adaptation of vampire fiction has been from Bram Stoker's 1897 novel Dracula, with over 170 versions to date. Running a distant second are adaptations of the 1872 novel Carmilla by Sheridan Le Fanu. By 2005, Dracula had been the subject of more films than any other fictional character except Sherlock Holmes. As folklore, vampires are defined by their need to feed on blood and on their manipulative nature; this theme has been held in common throughout the many adaptations.\\"vampire n.\\" The Concise Oxford English Dictionary, Twelfth edition . Ed. Catherine Soanes and Angus Stevenson. Oxford University Press, 2008. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press. York University. 23 October 2011 Although vampires are usually associated with the horror (and sometimes zombie genre), vampire films may also fall into the drama, action, science fiction, romance, comedy or fantasy genres, amongst others. History The Vampire, 1913 Early cinematic vampires in other such films as The Vampire (1913), directed by Robert G. Vignola, were not undead bloodsucking fiends, but 'vamps'. Such femmes fatales were inspired by a poem by Rudyard Kipling called \\"The Vampire\\", composed in 1897. This poem was written as kind of commentary on a painting of a female vampire by Philip Burne-Jones exhibited in the same year. Lyrics from Kipling's poem: A fool there was ... , describing a seduced man, were used as the title of the film A Fool There Was (1915) starring Theda Bara as the 'vamp' in question and the poem was used in the publicity for the film.Per the Oxford English Dictionary, vamp is originally English, used first by G. K. Chesterton, but popularized in the American silent film The Vamp, starring Enid Bennett The first adaptation of the immortal aristocrat was without a doubt the Hungarian feature film Drakula hal√°la (K√°roly Lajthay, 1921), which is now thought to be a lost film. An authentic supernatural vampire features in the landmark Nosferatu (1922 Germany, directed by F. W. Murnau) starring Max Schreck as the hideous Count Orlok. This was an unlicensed version of Bram Stoker's Dracula, based so closely on the novel that the estate sued and won, with all copies ordered to be destroyed. It would be painstakingly restored in 1994 by a team of European scholars from the five surviving prints that had escaped destruction. The destruction of the vampire, in the closing sequence of the film, by sunlight rather than the traditional stake through the heart proved very influential on later films and became an accepted part of vampire lore. The next classic treatment of the vampire legend was an adaptation of the stage play based on Bram Stoker's novel Dracula, Universal's Dracula (1931) starring Bela Lugosi as Count Dracula. Lugosi's performance was so popular that his Hungarian accent and sweeping gestures became characteristics now commonly associated with Dracula. Five years after the release of the film, Universal released Dracula's Daughter (1936), a direct sequel that starts immediately after the end of the first film. A second sequel, Son of Dracula starring Lon Chaney Jr., followed in 1943. Despite his apparent death in the 1931 film, the Count returned to life in three more Universal films of the mid-1940s: House of Frankenstein (1944) and House of Dracula (1945)‚Äîboth starring John Carradine‚Äîand Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948). While Lugosi had played a vampire in two other films during the 1930s and 1940s, it was only in this final film that he played Count Dracula on-screen for the second (and last) time. Dracula was reincarnated for a new generation in the Hammer Films series starring Christopher Lee as the Count. In the first of these films Dracula (1958) the spectacular death of the title character through being exposed to the sun reinforced this part of vampire lore, first established in Nosferatu, and made it virtually axiomatic in succeeding films. Lee returned as Dracula in all but two of the seven sequels. A more faithful adaptation of Stoker's novel appeared as Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992), directed by Francis Ford Coppola, though also identifying Count Dracula with the notorious medieval Balkan ruler Vlad III the Impaler. A distinct subgenre of vampire films, ultimately inspired by Le Fanu's \\"Carmilla\\", explored the topic of the lesbian vampire. Although implied in Dracula's Daughter, the first openly lesbian vampire was in Blood and Roses (1960) by Roger Vadim. More explicit lesbian content was provided in Hammer's Karnstein Trilogy. The first of these, The Vampire Lovers (1970), starring Ingrid Pitt and Madeline Smith, was a relatively straightforward re-telling of LeFanu's novella, but with more overt violence and sexuality. Later films in this subgenre such as Vampyres (1974) became even more explicit in their depiction of sex, nudity and violence. Beginning with Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948) the vampire has often been the subject of comedy. The Fearless Vampire Killers (1967) by Roman Polanski was a notable parody of the genre. Other comedic treatments, of variable quality, include Vampira (1974) featuring David Niven as a lovelorn Dracula, Love at First Bite (1979) featuring George Hamilton, My Best Friend Is a Vampire (1988), Innocent Blood (1992), Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1992), Dracula: Dead and Loving It (1995), directed by Mel Brooks with Leslie Nielsen, and, more recently, Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement's mockumentary take on the subject, What We Do in the Shadows (2014). Another development in some vampire films has been a change from supernatural horror to science fictional explanations of vampirism. The Last Man on Earth (1964, directed by Sidney Salkow), The Omega Man (1971 US, directed by Boris Sagal) and two other films were all based on Richard Matheson's novel I Am Legend. They explain the condition as having a natural cause. Vampirism is explained as a kind of virus in David Cronenberg's Rabid (1976) and Red-Blooded American Girl (1990) directed by David Blyth, as well as in the Blade trilogy to a limited extent. Race has been another theme, as exemplified by the blaxploitation picture Blacula (1972) and its sequel Scream Blacula Scream. Though always a representation of passion and desire, since the time of B√©la Lugosi's Dracula (1931) the vampire, male or female, has usually been portrayed as an alluring sex symbol. Christopher Lee, Delphine Seyrig, Frank Langella and Lauren Hutton are just a few examples of actors who brought great sex appeal into their portrayal of the vampire. Latterly, the implicit sexual themes of vampire film have become much more overt, culminating in such films as Gayracula (1983) and The Vampire of Budapest (1995), two pornographic all- male vampire films, and Lust for Dracula (2005), a softcore pornography all- lesbian adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel. There is, however, a very small subgenre, pioneered in Murnau's seminal Nosferatu (1922) in which the portrayal of the vampire is similar to the hideous creature of European folklore. Max Schreck's portrayal of this role in Murnau's film was copied by Klaus Kinski in Werner Herzog's remake Nosferatu the Vampyre (1979). In Shadow of the Vampire (2000) (directed by E. Elias Merhige) Willem Dafoe plays Max Schreck, himself, though portrayed here as an actual vampire. Stephen King's Salem's Lot (1979) notably depicts vampires as terrifying, simple-minded creatures, without eroticism, and with the only desire to feed on the blood of others. The main vampire in the Subspecies films, Radu, also exhibits similar aesthetic influences, such as long fingers and nails and generally grotesque facial features. This type of vampire is also featured in the film 30 Days of Night. A major character in most vampire films is the vampire hunter, of which Stoker's Abraham Van Helsing is a prototype. However, killing vampires has changed. Where Van Helsing relied on a stake through the heart, in Vampires (1998), directed by John Carpenter, Jack Crow (James Woods) has a heavily armed squad of vampire hunters and in Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1992, directed by Fran Rubel Kuzui), writer Joss Whedon (who created TV's Buffy the Vampire Slayer and spin-off Angel) attached the Slayer, Buffy Summers (Kristy Swanson in the film, Sarah Michelle Gellar in the TV series), to a network of Watchers and mystically endowed her with superhuman powers. =Dracula in films and his legacy= By far, the most well-known and popular vampire in the films is Count Dracula. A large number of films have been filmed over the years depicting the evil Count, some of which are ranked among the greatest depictions of vampires on film. Dracula has over 170 film representations to date, making him the most frequently portrayed character in horror films; also he has the highest number of film appearances overall, surpassed only by Sherlock Holmes. Christopher Lee portrayed Dracula in nine films = Vampire television series =  Live action  One of the first television series with a vampire as a main character was the 1964 comedy series The Munsters. Lily Munster and Grandpa (also known as Vladimir Dracula, Count of Transylvania) are vampires. The Munsters was followed in 1966 by the Gothic soap opera Dark Shadows, in which the vampire Barnabas Collins became a main character. In 1985, The Little Vampire was a television series made for children. It tells the adventures of the vampire child R√ºdiger and his human friend Anton. Forever Knight (1992‚Äì1996) was the first vampire detective story, later followed by many similar series like Angel, Moonlight, Blood Ties and Vampire Prosecutor. In 1997 the teenage vampire series Buffy the Vampire Slayer became popular around the world. Buffy is a teenage girl who finds out that she is a vampire slayer. She also finds herself drawn to a vampire. True Blood (2008) centers on the adventures of the telepathic waitress Sookie Stackhouse, who falls in love with a vampire. In the same year BBC Three series Being Human became popular in Britain. It features an unconventional trio of a vampire, a werewolf and a ghost who are sharing a flat in Bristol. In 2009 The Vampire Diaries told the story of the school girl Elena Gilbert, who falls in love with vampire Stefan Salvatore, but finds herself also drawn to Stefan's brother Damon Salvatore. The Strain (2014) is based on the novel of the same name by Guillermo del Toro.  Animation  One of the first animated vampire series was the 1988 series Count Duckula, a parody of Dracula. In 1985, the anime film adaptation of the inaugural Vampire Hunter D novel was released direct-to-video and became popular in both Japan and the United States, prompting an adaptation of the third novel into the also direct to video film Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust in 2000. The two films and the novels they are based on revolve around the eponymous D, a vampire hunter who is the apparent half-vampire/half-human son of Dracula who battles vampires in the year AD 12,090. In 1997 the anime series Vampire Princess Miyu became popular in Japan, many other anime followed. Later in 2012, Hotel Transylvania was released, followed by a sequel in 2015, Hotel Transylvania 2 and in 2018 by Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation. Another Japanese anime series, Rosario + Vampire, portrays one of the leading female characters, Moka Akashiya, as a vampire, whose demonic powers are sealed inside her with a rosary seal around her neck. The series portrays other kinds of fictional monsters as well, including a witch and a snowwoman. = Vampire web series = From 2001 onward vampire web series became popular around the world. One of the first web series was the 2001 series The Hunted. It is about a group of vampire slayers who have been bitten by vampires (but not yet turned into vampires) and try to fight the bloodsucking vampires. The Hunted was followed by 30 Days of Night: Blood Trails (2007) and 30 Days of Night: Dust to Dust (2008) who were based on the films 30 Days of Night and 30 Days of Night: Dark Days. In 2009 the MTV online series Valemont follows Maggie Gracen, who decides to infiltrate Valemont University, because her brother Eric has vanished. She soon finds out that the University is full of vampires. The 2009 web series I Heart Vampires focuses on two teenage vampire fans, who find out that vampires are more than real. In 2011 the Being Human spin-off Becoming Human was released online. It is about a vampire, a werewolf and a ghost who go to a school together and try to solve a murder. The 2014 vampire series Carmilla features a retelling of the story of the vampire Carmilla Karnstein, who attends a university in the modern day and falls in love with a human girl.

They are also used for cooling and for the control of airborne dust. Sprinkler irrigation is the method of applying water in a controlled manner in way similar to rainfall. The water is distributed through a network that may consist of pumps, valves, pipes, and sprinklers. Irrigation sprinklers can be used for residential, industrial, and agricultural usage. It is useful on uneven land where sufficient water is not available as well as on sandy soil. The perpendicular pipes, having rotating nozzles on top, are joined to the main pipeline at regular intervals. When water is pressurized through the main pipe it escapes from the rotating nozzles. It gets sprinkled on the crop. In sprinkler or overhead irrigation, water is piped to one more central locations within the field and distributed by overhead high pressure sprinklers or guns.  Types  = Industrial = Higher pressure sprinklers that themselves move in a circle are driven by a ball drive, gear drive, or impact mechanism (impact sprinklers). These can be designed to rotate in a full or partial circle. Rainguns are similar to impact sprinklers, except that they generally operate at very high pressures of 40 to 130 lbf/in¬≤ (275 to 900 kPa) and flows of 50 to 1200 US gal/min (3 to 76 L/s), usually with nozzle diameters in the range of 0.5 to 1.9 inches (10 to 50 mm). In addition to irrigation, guns are used for industrial applications such as dust suppression and logging. Many irrigation sprinklers are buried in the ground along with their supporting plumbing, although above ground and moving sprinklers are also common. Most irrigation sprinklers operate through electric and hydraulic technology and are grouped together in zones that can be collectively turned on and off by actuating a solenoid valve. =Residential= An oscillating sprinkler is commonly used to water residential lawns, and is moved as needed. Home lawn sprinklers vary widely in their size, cost, and complexity. They include impact sprinklers, oscillating sprinklers, drip sprinklers, underground sprinkler systems, and portable sprinklers. Permanently installed systems may often operate on timers or other automated processes. They are occasionally installed with retractable heads for aesthetic and practical reasons, reducing damage during lawn mowing. These types of systems usually can be programmed to start automatically on a set time and day each week. Small portable sprinklers can be placed temporarily on lawns if additional watering is needed or if no permanent system is in place. These are often attached to an outdoor water faucet and are placed for a short period of time. Other systems may be professionally installed permanently in the ground and are attached permanently to a home's plumbing system. An antique sprinkler developed by Nomad called a 'set-and-forget tractor sprinkler' was used in Australia in the 1950s. Water pressure ensured that the sprinkler moved slowly across a lawn.The Ride family's 'Nomad' brand tractor lawn sprinkler, National Museum of Australia =Agricultural science= The first use of sprinklers by farmers was some form of home and golf course type sprinklers. These ad hoc systems, while doing the job of the buried pipes and fixed sprinkler heads, interfered with cultivation and were expensive to maintain. Center-pivot irrigation was invented in 1940 by farmer Frank Zybach, who lived in Strasburg, Colorado. In the 1950s, Stout-Wyss Irrigation System, a firm based in Portland, Oregon, developed a rolling pipe type irrigation system for farms that has become the most popular type for farmers irrigating large fields. With this system, large wheels attached to the large pipes with sprinkler heads move slowly across the field.\\"Irrigation Pipe on Wheels Move Across Fields\\", July 1950 Popular Science, bottom of page 114 Underground sprinklers  Underground sprinklers function through means of basic electronic and hydraulic technology. This valve and all of the sprinklers that will be activated by this valve are known as a zone. Upon activation, the solenoid, which sits on top of the valve is magnetized lifting a small stainless steel plunger in its center. By doing this, the activated (or raised) plunger allows water to escape from the top of a rubber diaphragm located in the center of the valve. Water that has been charged and waiting on the bottom of this same diaphragm now has the higher pressure and lifts the diaphragm. This pressurized water is then allowed to escape down stream of the valve through a series of pipes, usually made of PVC (higher pressure commercial systems) or polyethylene pipe (for typically lower pressure residential systems). At the end of these pipes and flush to ground level (typically) are pre measured and spaced out sprinklers. These sprinklers can be fixed spray heads that have a set pattern and generally spray between 1.5 m and 2 m (7‚Äì15 ft.), full rotating sprinklers that can spray a broken stream of water from 6 m to 12 m (20‚Äì40 ft.), or small drip emitters that release a slow, steady drip of water on more delicate plants such as flowers and shrubs. Use of indigenous materials also recommended. Health risks In 2017, it was reported that use of common garden hoses in combination with spray nozzles may generate aerosols containing droplets smaller than 10 Œºm, which can be inhaled by nearby people. Water stagnating in a hose between uses, especially when warmed by the sun, can host the growth and interaction of Legionella and free-living amoebae (FLA) as biofilms on the inner surface of the hose. Clinical cases of Legionnaires' disease or Pontiac fever have been found to be associated with inhalation of garden hose aerosols containing Legionella bacteria. The report provides measured microbial densities resulting from controlled hose conditions in order to quantify the human health risks. The densities of Legionella spp. identified in two types of hoses were found to be similar to those reported during legionellosis outbreaks from other causes. It is proposed that the risk could be mitigated by draining hoses after use.

The Ponzo illusion is a geometrical-optical illusion that was first demonstrated by the Italian psychologist Mario Ponzo (1882‚Äì1960) in 1911. He suggested that the human mind judges an object's size based on its background. He showed this by drawing two identical lines across a pair of converging lines, similar to railway tracks. The upper line looks longer because we interpret the converging sides according to linear perspective as parallel lines receding into the distance. In this context, we interpret the upper line as though it were farther away, so we see it as longer ‚Äì a farther object would have to be longer than a nearer one for both to produce retinal images of the same size. One of the explanations for the Ponzo illusion is the \\"perspective hypothesis\\", which states that the perspective feature in the figure is obviously produced by the converging lines ordinarily associated with distance, that is, the two oblique lines appear to converge toward the horizon or a vanishing point. Another is the \\"framing-effects hypothesis\\", which says that the difference in the separation or gap of the horizontal lines from the framing converging lines may determine, or at least contribute to the magnitude of the distortion. The Ponzo illusion is one possible explanation of the Moon illusion, with objects appearing \\"far away\\" (because they are \\"on\\" the horizon) appearing bigger than objects \\"overhead\\". However, some have argued that explaining one perception (\\"appears far away\\") in terms of another (\\"appears bigger\\") is problematic scientifically, and that there are probably complex internal processes behind these illusions. The Ponzo illusion also occurs in touch and with an auditory-to-visual sensory- substitution device. However, prior visual experience seems mandatory to perceive it as demonstrated by the fact that congenitally blind subjects are not sensitive to it. The Ponzo illusion has also been used to demonstrate a dissociation between vision-for-perception and vision-for-action (see Two- streams hypothesis). Thus, the scaling of grasping movements directed towards objects embedded within a Ponzo illusion is not subject to the size illusion. In other words, the opening between the index finger and thumb is scaled to the real not the apparent size of the target object as the grasping hand approaches the object. Cross-cultural differences in susceptibility to the Ponzo illusion have been noted, with non-Western and rural people showing less susceptibility. Other recent research suggests that an individual's receptivity to this illusion, as well as the Ebbinghaus illusion, may be inversely correlated with the size of that individual's primary visual cortex.

Life  Champneys was born in Whitechapel, London, on 17 September 1842 into a family with a modest income, his father, William Weldon Champneys, was an Evangelical Vicar of St Mary's Church, Whitechapel (later Dean of Lichfield). His mother, Mary Anne, was fourth daughter of the goldsmith and silversmith Paul Storr (his cousins thus including Rev. Vernon Storr, Archdeacon of Westminster from 1931 to 1936, Rev. Frank Utterton, Archdeacon of Surrey from 1906 to 1908, the artists Rex Whistler and Laurence Whistler, and the academic Michael Lindsay, 2nd Baron Lindsay of Birker).Paul Storr 1771-1844, Silversmith and Goldsmith, N. M. Penzer, Hamlyn Publishing Group, 1971, pp. 16‚Äì17 One of eight children, he attended Charterhouse School, showing a talent for mathematics and lacking in drawing skills. In 1860, he entered Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1864, he failed to get the 'first class' degree he had hoped for, achieving a second class in the Classical Tripos, and he took articles to study as an architect with John Prichard, the Surveyor of Llandaff Cathedral. Champneys set up his practice as an architect in 1867 in Queen's Square, London, close to the office of Morris & Co. In 1876 he married May Theresa Ella, a daughter of Maurice Drummond, descendant of William Drummond, 4th Viscount Strathallan, and they had two sons and two daughters. Champneys was a member of the Century Guild, the Athenaeum Club and the Saville Club, making acquaintances with Walter Pater, Robert Louis Stevenson, Sidney Colvin, and Coventry Patmore. In 1912 the Royal Institute of British Architects awarded Champneys its Royal Gold Medal for architecture. Champneys died at his home, 42 Frognall Lane, Hampstead, on 5 April 1935. He was the brother of Brasenose rowers Weldon Champneys (clergyman) and Sir Francis Champneys (doctor).  Writings  His writings include an introduction to Henry Merritt: Art Criticism and Romance, published in 1879 and Churches about Queen Victoria Street, a portfolio published in 1871, Victorian art and originality for the British Architect published in 1887, and The architecture of Queen Victoria's reign for the Art Journal, published in 1887. A Quiet Corner of England: Studies of Landscape and Architecture in Winchelsea, Rye and Romney Marsh was published in 1875 after being circulated as a portfolio and a work regarding his mother-in-law, Adelaide Drummond, A Retrospect and Memoir, was published in 1915. Champneys' correspondence has been preserved in the General Collection of the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library.  Architecture  Somerville College Library, Oxford John Rylands Library (1900) in Manchester ‚Äì Grade-I listed and considered Champneys' magnum opus. Believing that architecture was 'an art not a science' he joined the Art Workers Guild instead of the Royal Institute of British Architects. Although Champneys was able to work in the Gothic style that John Prichard preferred and taught, he later became one of the pioneers of the Queen Anne style, working on at least 100 buildings throughout England. John Rylands' widow, Enriqueta Rylands, had admired the library Champneys had designed for Mansfield College, Oxford and hired him to develop the design on a more lavish scale ‚Äì The John Rylands Memorial Library in Deansgate, Manchester took nine years to build before opening on 1 January 1900, it is one of Champneys' finest designs. The Rhodes Building, Oriel College, Oxford Champneys' Oxford buildings include the Church of St Peter-le-Bailey (1872‚Äì1874), which serves as the chapel for St Peter's College, New Old Hall in Lady Margaret Hall (1881‚Äì1883), the Indian Institute (1883‚Äì1896), the Mansfield College library (1886‚Äì1889), the Robinson Tower at New College (1896), the Somerville College Library (1903), the St. Alban Hall buildings at Merton College (1905‚Äì1910), a chapel and residence hall at Linacre College (1907‚Äì1909), the Rhodes Building in Oriel College (1908‚Äì1911). His Cambridge works include the Archaeological Museum (1883), now Peterhouse Theatre, the Divinity and Literary School and Newnham College (between 1875 and 1910), for which he is credited for bringing a 'touch of lightness' to the college and is acknowledged for his attention to both construction details, and to cost. Champneys' buildings elsewhere include the chapel of Mill Hill School, London (1898), buildings for Bedford College in Regent's Park (1910), King Edward VII School (King's Lynn) (1910‚Äì1913), the Butler Museum at Harrow School (1886), the museum at Winchester College (1898), and Bedford High School (1878‚Äì1892). Champneys also designed the Wilnecote Board School buildings as a slightly earlier work in 1877; this building is in danger of demolition due to Staffordshire County Council wishing to give the land away to a land developer. Churches by Champneys include his father's parish church, St Luke's, Kentish Town (1867‚Äì1870), the sailors' church of St Mary Star of the Sea, Hastings (1878), and St Chad, Slindon, Staffordshire (1894). In 1897 he did the painting of clouds, cherubs and scrolls on the ceiling of St George the Martyr Southwark in London. In 1898 he added a porch to St Mary, Manchester, where he was surveyor, and between 1902 and 1903, a south annexe. His home, Hall Oak, in Frognal, Hampstead was also one of his works.

PHR headquarters are in New York City, with offices in Boston and Washington, D.C. It was established in 1986 to use the unique skills and credibility of health professionals to advocate for persecuted health workers, prevent torture, document mass atrocities, and hold those who violate human rights accountable.  History  In 1981, Dr. Jonathan Fine, a primary care physician in Boston, was asked to fly to Chile on short notice and lead a delegation seeking the release of three prominent physicians by General Augusto Pinochet‚Äôs regime. The three Chilean doctors were released five weeks after Dr. Fine's visit. In 1986, recognizing the impact physicians could have in the human rights field, Dr. Fine co-founded Physicians for Human Rights with Dr. Jane Green Schaller, Dr. Robert Lawrence, Dr. Jack Geiger, and Dr. Carola Eisenberg. Since the organization‚Äôs founding, PHR teams have exposed the use of chemical weapons against civilians in Iraq, exhumed mass graves in Bosnia and Rwanda for international tribunals, and provided evidence for criminal investigations into torture and extrajudicial executions in countries such as Colombia, Honduras, Libya, Mexico, Peru, and Sierra Leone. In 1997, the organization shared the Nobel Peace Prize for medically documenting landmine injuries and serving as a leader in the International Campaign to Ban Landmines. PHR has also been at the forefront in developing standards for human rights abuse documentation: staff member Dr. Vincent Iacopino played a lead role in developing the Istanbul Protocol, the recognized international standard for documenting torture and ill treatment. Likewise, the Director of the International Forensics Program was involved in the revision process of the Minnesota Protocol, the international guidance on the investigation of potentially unlawful death. Governments, United Nations agencies, international and national courts, and other human rights organizations have all sought PHR‚Äôs forensic and research expertise. The organization‚Äôs work has contributed to landmark decisions such as the 2016 conviction of Radovan Karad≈æiƒá.  Programs  = International Forensics Program = Health professionals in PHR‚Äôs International Forensics Program (IFP) use forensic investigations such as autopsies and medical and psychological evaluations, to determine the nature of abuse that victims have endured. These evaluations can then contribute to evidence for prosecutions or be used to bring attention to crimes. The IFP has performed forensic investigations for bodies such as the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. Experts in the IFP range from forensic pathologists to forensic anthropologists, as well as analytical scientists such as firearm examiners. They perform forensic investigations, evaluations, monitoring, or review of other parties‚Äô forensic work. = Forensic Training Institute = PHR launched the Forensic Training Institute (FTI) to strengthen local capacities for forensic investigations and documentation. The institute seeks to strengthen the ability of medical personnel to document torture, mass atrocities, sexual violence, and the persecution of health care workers. It also trains legal and law enforcement professionals who seek redress via local, national, and international justice mechanisms. PHR‚Äôs FTI program has partners in Afghanistan, Burma, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Kyrgyzstan, Syria, Tajikistan, and the United States. The program has specifically helped clinicians strengthen their interviewing techniques, physical examinations, evidence collection, crime scene documentation, forensic photography, and grave exhumation. = Program on Sexual Violence in Conflict Zones = PHR‚Äôs Program on Sexual Violence in Conflict Zones was launched in 2011. The program strengthens cross-sectoral responses to sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Kenya through training workshops for health care, law enforcement, and legal professionals. While PHR itself has engaged in many forensic investigations and advocacy efforts around rape in armed conflict, the Program on Sexual Violence in Conflict Zones builds local capacities for the collection of court-admissible evidence to support prosecutions for sexual violence crimes. The program has an office at renowned gynecological surgeon Dr. Denis Mukwege‚Äôs Panzi Hospital, in Bukavu, Democratic Republic of Congo. The Program on Sexual Violence in Conflict Zones partners with Panzi Hospital to train and mentor health workers, police officers, lawyers, and judges in effective documentation and prosecution of sexual violence. To aid the documentation of sexual violence, PHR has developed MediCapt, an app allowing the secure digital recording and transmission of medical evidence. = Asylum Program = PHR‚Äôs Asylum Program advocates for improved conditions in U.S. immigration detention centers and documents abuses suffered by asylum seekers in their home countries and in U.S. care. The network consists of hundreds of volunteer health professionals who provide medical evaluations to survivors of human rights violations, strengthening their applications for asylum in the United States. PHR‚Äôs documentation of abuses has involved investigations into the use of solitary confinement in immigration detention facilities, indefinite detention, and violations of the right to health in detention. In 2010, PHR partnered with Weill Cornell Medicine to create the Weill Cornell Center for Human Rights (WCCHR), a medical student-run human rights clinic that assists survivors of torture seeking asylum in the United States. = U.S. Anti-Torture Program = PHR‚Äôs U.S. Anti-Torture Program (ATP) was launched in 2003, after reports of torture by U.S. military personnel were first exposed. PHR published a series of investigative reports documenting the U.S. government‚Äôs use of torture in pursuit of national security goals. ‚ÄùBreak Them Down,‚Äù published in 2005, found evidence of the systematic psychological torture employed by the military. Additional reports documented the severe physical and mental harm inflicted by interrogation practices and human experimentation in Guantanamo Bay. = Research and Investigations = The research and investigations department at PHR documents human rights abuses around the world. Their areas of research include attacks on health care and health personnel, mass atrocities, torture, and sexual violence across the globe. Notable investigations include: 1988 ‚Äî PHR researchers uncover evidence of the Iraqi government using chemical weapons on their Kurdish citizens. 1996 ‚Äî PHR teams exhumes mass graves in the Balkans. They provided evidence of ethnic cleansing to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). This work contributed to the ICTY‚Äôs conviction of Radovan Karad≈æiƒá of war crimes, genocide, and crimes against humanity. 1996 ‚Äî PHR sends a team to exhume mass graves in Rwanda and eventually provides forensic evidence to the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. 2004 ‚Äî PHR researchers investigate mass killings in Darfur. The organization is the first to call the events genocide. 2010 ‚Äî PHR begins a successful global lobbying campaign to free Dr. Kamiar Alaei and Dr. Arash Alaei, brothers imprisoned in Iran for their work on the treatment of people with HIV/AIDS. 2011 ‚Äî PHR researchers begin documenting assaults on Syrian health care workers and infrastructure, creating an interactive map of attacks and revealing the Syrian government‚Äôs systemic targeting of hospitals and health workers. 2015 ‚Äî PHR issues a report on the state of health care in eastern Aleppo city after almost five years of the Syrian conflict, revealing that almost 95% of doctors had fled, been detained, or been killed. 2019 ‚Äî published report, My Only Crime Was That I Was a Doctor about Assad's targeting of medical personnel and civilians in Syria.  National Student Program  PHR‚Äôs National Student Program engages medical students and young health professionals in health and human rights work by organizing local action on human rights issues, raising awareness on campuses, organizing educational events, and calling on elected officials to take action. PHR has student chapters across the United States, and collaborates with them through PHR‚Äôs university-affiliated asylum clinics and national student conferences. The program has created tools and resources for student chapters covering topics such as medical professionalism, health and human rights education, and the Istanbul Protocol.

Jacob Rodrigues Pereira was born in Berlanga (Badajoz), Spain, he was a descendant of a Portuguese Crypto-Jews family from Chacim, Tr√°s-os-Montes. His baptismal name was Francisco Ant√≥nio Rodrigues, and his parents were Jo√£o Lopes Dias and Leonor Rodrigues Pereira. In about 1741 he and his mother and siblings moved to Bordeaux and returned to Judaism, he adopted the name Jacob and his mother Abigail Rivka Rodrigues. Jacob Rodrigues P√©reire formulated signs for numbers and punctuation and adapted Juan Pablo Bonet's manual alphabet by adding 30 handshapes each corresponding to a sound instead of to a letter. He is therefore seen as one of the inventors of manual language for the deaf and is credited with being the first person to teach a non-verbal deaf person to speak. In 1759, he was made a member of the Royal Society of London. Rodrigues Pereira with patient A lifelong devotee to the well-being of the Jews of southern France, Portugal, and Spain, beginning in 1749 he was a volunteer agent for the Portuguese Jews at Paris. In 1777, his efforts led to Jews from Portugal receiving the right to settle in France. In 1772, he published a Tahitian vocabulary for Louis-Antoine de Bougainville's Voyage, after learning the language from Ahutoru, the first Tahitian to sail aboard a European vessel. In 1876 Pereira's remains were transferred from the Cimeti√®re de la Villette (where he had been buried the year in which that cemetery was opened) to that of the Cimeti√®re de Montmartre. In Bordeaux the street \\"Rodrigues-Pereire\\" was named in his honor. His grandsons, the P√©reire brothers, √âmile P√©reire (1800‚Äì75) and Isaac P√©reire (1806‚Äì80), were well-known French financiers and bankers during the second empire who encouraged the construction of the first railway in France in 1835.

He ascended to throne after competing with his brothers. He expanded his kingdom and made expeditions to help neighbouring kingdoms. In 1532, Gujarat came under attack of the Mughal Emperor Humayun and fell. Bahadur Shah regained the kingdom in 1536 but he was killed by the Portuguese on board the ship when making a deal with them. Early years Bahadur Shah's father was Shams-ud-Din Muzaffar Shah II, who had ascended to the throne of the Gujarat Sultanate in 1511. Muzaffar Shah II nominated Sikandar Shah (Bahadur Shah's elder brother) as the heir apparent to the throne. Bahadur Khan's relationship with his brother and father became tense as Sikandar Shah began to assume greater administrative control. Fearing for his life, Bahadur Khan fled Gujarat, first seeking refuge with Chittor, and then with Ibrahim Lodi. He was present at the Battle of Panipat, though he did not take part in fighting. After death of Muzaffar Shah II in 1526, Sikandar Sh√°h succeeded. After few weeks in power, he was murdered on the instructions of his slave Im√°d-ul-Mulk Khush Kadam, who seated an infant brother of Sikandar's, named N√°sir Kh√°n, on the throne with the title of Mahmud Shah II and governed on his behalf. Three other princes were poisoned. The only event of Sikandar's reign was the destruction of an army sent against his brother Lat√≠f Kh√°n who was helped by R√°na Bh√≠m of Munga (now Chhota Udaipur). When Bhadur Khan received the news of the death of his father, he returned to Gujarat. The nobles deserted Im√°d-ul-Mulk's cause, and prince B√°h√°dur Kh√°n, was joined by many supporters prominent among whom was T√°j Kh√°n, proprietor of Dhandhuka. Bah√°dur marched at once on Ch√°mp√°ner, captured and executed Im√°d-ul-Mulk and poisoning N√°sir Kh√°n ascended the throne in 1527 with the title of Bah√°dur Sh√°h.Majumdar, R.C. (ed.) (2007). The Mughul Empire, Mumbai: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, , pp.391-8 His brother Lat√≠f Kh√°n, aided by R√°ja Bh√≠m of the Kohistan or hill land of P√°l (Pal-Dadhvav, near Bhuloda, Gujarat), now asserted his claim to the throne. He was defeated, and fell wounded into the hands of the Gujar√°t army and died of his wounds and was buried at Halol. R√°ja Bh√≠m was slain. As Bh√≠m's successor R√°isingh plundered Dahod, a large force was sent against him, commanded by T√°j Kh√°n, who laid waste R√°isingh's country and dismantled his forts. Only one of his brother, Chand Khan survived, as he had refuge at the Malwa court and the Sultan Mahmud II of Malwa refused to surrender him. Reign A copper coin of Bahadur During his reign, Gujarat was under pressure from the expanding Mughal Empire under emperors Babur (died 1530) and Humayun (1530‚Äì1540), and from the Portuguese, who were establishing fortified settlements on the Gujarat coast to expand their power in India from their base in Goa. =Expansion of Sultanate= Soon after Bah√°dur Sh√°h visited Cambay, and found that Malik Is- h√°k the governor of Sorath and son of Malik Ayyaz, had, in the interests of the Portuguese, attempted to seize Diu but had been repulsed by the Gujar√°t admiral Mahm√∫d √Åka. The Sult√°n entrusted Diu to Kiw√°m-ul-Mulk and Jun√°ga·∏çh to Muj√°hid Kh√°n Bh√≠kan and returned to √Åhmed√°b√°d. In 1527 he enforced tribute from √çdar and the neighbouring country. During one of his numerous expeditions he went to hunt in N√°ndod and received the homage of the R√°ja. As the Portuguese were endeavouring to establish themselves on the coast of Sorath, and, if possible, to obtain Diu, the king was constantly at Cambay (now Khambhat), Diu and Ghogha to frustrate their attempts, and he now directed the construction of the fortress of Bharuch. At this time Muhammad Kh√°n, ruler of As√≠r and Burh√°npur (both of Khandesh), requested Bah√°dur's aid on behalf of Im√°d-ul-Mulk, ruler of Berar. Bah√°dur Sh√°h started at once and at Nandurb√°r was joined by Muhammad Kh√°n As√≠ri, and thence proceeded to Burh√°npur, where he was met by Im√°d Sh√°h from G√°valgad. After certain successes he made peace between Burh√°n Niz√°m Sh√°h and Im√°d Sh√°h G√°vali, and returned to Gujar√°t. J√°m F√≠r√∫z the ruler of Thatta in Sindh now sought refuge with Bah√°dur Sh√°h from the oppression either of the Ghoris or of the Mughals and was hospitably received. In 1528 Bah√°dur made an expedition into the Deccan which ended in a battle at Daulatabad. Later he was forced to retire because of the stiff resistance put up by the Ahmadnagar army. Next year (1529) at the request of Ja√¢far or Khizr Kh√°n, son of Im√°d Sh√°h G√°vali, who was sent to Gujar√°t to solicit Bah√°dur's help, he again marched for the Deccan. As he passed through Muler Biharji the R√°ja of B√°gl√°n gave him his daughter in marriage and in return received the title of Bahr Kh√°n. From B√°gl√°n Bahr Kh√°n was told off to ravage Chaul which by this time had fallen into the hands of the Portuguese. Bah√°dur himself advanced to Ahmednagar, took the fort and destroyed many of the buildings. Purandhar also was sacked of its stores of gold. From Ahmednagar, Bah√°dur Sh√°h passed to Burh√°npur, and there his general Kaisar Kh√°n gained a victory over the united forces of Niz√°m Sh√°h, Malik Ber√≠d, and Ain-ul-Mulk. Finally, both the rulers of the Ahmadnagar and Berar were forced to sign a humiliating treaty. Bah√°dur returned to Gujar√°t and for some time refrained from interfering in the affairs of the Deccan. Between 1526 and 1530, certain Turks under one M√∫stafa came to Gujar√°t, traders according to one account according to another part of a Turkish fleet expected to act against the Portuguese. Diu was assigned them as a place of residence and the command of the island was granted to Malik T√∫gh√°n, son of Malik Ayy√°z, the former governor. Bahadur Shah had sent a delegation headed by ‚ÄòAbd al-‚ÄòAziz Asaf Khan to Ottoman Empire in 1530s. In 1530 the king marched to N√°gor, and gave an audience both to Prathir√°j R√°ja of Dungarpur] and to the ambassadors from R√°na Ratansi of Chittor. The R√°na's ambassadors complained of encroachments on Chittor by Mahm√∫d II of Malwa Sultanate. Mahm√∫d promised to appear before Bah√°dur to explain the alleged encroachments. Bah√°dur waited. At last as Mahm√∫d failed to attend Bah√°dur said he would go and meet Mahm√∫d. He invested M√°ndu and received with favour certain deserters from Mahm√∫d's army. The fortress fell and Sult√°n Mahm√∫d and his seven sons were captured without any resistance on March 28, 1531 Mandu. Malwa was annexed into his kingdom. After passing the rainy season at M√°ndu, Bah√°dur Sh√°h went to Burh√°npur to visit his nephew Mir√°n Muhammad Sh√°h. At Burh√°npur, Bah√°dur under the influence of the great priest-statesman Sh√°h T√°hir, was reconciled with Burh√°n Niz√°m and gave him the royal canopy he had taken from M√°lwa. Bah√°dur offered Sh√°h T√°hir the post of minister. Sh√°h T√°hir declined saying he must make a pilgrimage to Mecca. He retired to Ahmednagar and there converted Burh√°n Niz√°m Sh√°h to the Shia Islam. In the same year, hearing that M√°nsingji, R√°ja of Halvad, had killed the commandant of Dasada, Bah√°dur despatched Kh√°n Kh√°n√°n against him. Viramgam and M√°ndal were taken over from the Jh√°la chieftains, and ever after formed part of the crown dominions. When Malwa's Sult√°n Mahm√∫d II and his sons were being conveyed to the fortress of Champaner, R√°isingh, R√°ja of P√°l, endeavoured to rescue them. The attempt failed, and the prisoners were put to death by their guards. In 1531, on Bah√°dur's return from Burh√°npur to Dh√°r, hearing that Silehdi, the R√°jput chief of R√°isin in east M√°lwa kept in captivity certain women who had belonged to the harem of Sult√°n N√°sir-ud- d√≠n of M√°lwa, Bah√°dur marched against him and forced him to surrender and embrace Isl√°m. The chief secretly sent to the R√°na of Chitor for aid and delayed handing over R√°isin. On learning this Bah√°dur dispatched a force to keep Chitor in check and pressed the siege. At his own request, Silehdi was sent to persuade the garrison to surrender. But their reproaches stung him so sharply, that, joining with them, they sallied forth sword in hand and were all slain. R√°isin fell into Bah√°dur's hands, and this district together with those of Bhilsa and Chanderi were entrusted to the government of Sult√°n Alam Lodhi. The king now went to Gondwana to hunt elephants, and, after capturing many, employed his army in reducing Gagraon and other minor fortresses. In 1532, he advanced against Chittor, but raised the siege on receiving an enormous ransom. Shortly afterwards his troops took the strong fort of Ranthambhore. About this time on receipt of news that the Portuguese were usurping authority, the Sult√°n repaired to Diu. Before he arrived the Portuguese had taken to flight, leaving behind them an enormous gun which the Sult√°n ordered to be dragged to Ch√°mp√°ner. =Mughal Conquest of Gujarat= The Mughal Emperor Humayun, fights Bahadur Shah of Gujarat, in the year 1535. Before 1532 was over, Bah√°dur Sh√°h quarrelled with Humayun, the Mughal emperor of Delhi. The original ground of quarrel was that Bah√°dur Sh√°h had sheltered Sult√°n Muhammad Zam√°n M√≠rza, the grandson of a daughter of the emperor Babar (1482‚Äì1530). Hum√°y√∫n's anger was increased by an insolent answer from Bahadur Shah. Without considering that he had provoked a powerful enemy, Bah√°dur Sh√°h again laid siege to Chittor, and though he heard that Hum√°y√∫n had arrived at Gwalior, he would not desist from the siege. In March 1535 Chittor fell into the hands of the Gujar√°t king but near Mandas√∫r his army was shortly afterwards routed by Hum√°y√∫n. According to one account, the failure of the Gujar√°t army was due to Bah√°dur and his nobles being spell-bound by looking at a heap of salt and some cloth soaked in indigo which were mysteriously left before Bah√°dur's tent by an unknown elephant. The usual and probably true explanation is that R√∫mi Kh√°n the Turk, head of the Gujar√°t artillery, betrayed Bah√°dur's interest. Still though R√∫mi Kh√°n's treachery may have had a share in Bah√°dur's defeat it seems probable that in valour, discipline, and tactics the Gujar√°t army was inferior to the Mughals. Bah√°dur Sh√°h, unaccustomed to defeat, lost heart and fled to Mandu, which fortress was speedily taken by Hum√°y√∫n. From M√°ndu the king fled to Ch√°mp√°ner, and finally took refuge in Diu. Ch√°mp√°ner fell to Hum√°y√∫n, and the whole of Gujar√°t, except Sorath, came under his rule. At this time Sher Sh√°h S√∫r revolted, in Bihar and Jaunpur, and Hum√°y√∫n returned to Agra to oppose him leaving his brother Hind√°l M√≠rza in √Åhmed√°b√°d, K√°sam Beg in Bharuch, and Y√°dg√°r N√°sir M√≠rza in P√°tan. As soon as Hum√°y√∫n departed, the country rose against the Mughals, and his old nobles requested the king to join them. Bah√°dur joined them, and, defeating the Mughals at Kan√≠j village near Mahm√∫d√°b√°d (now Mahemdavad), expelled them from Gujar√°t. =Engagement with the Portuguese and death= Death of Bahadur Shah in front of Diu during negotiations with the Portuguese, in 1537. Akbar Nama, end of 16th century. While, Bahadur was engaged in the siege of Mandu against the Mughal, a strong Portuguese fleet sailed from Bombaim (now Mumbai), led by Nuno da Cunha. On February 7, 1531 the fleet reached near Shiyal Bet island, which they captured overcoming in spite of strong resistance. On February 16, 1531 they started bombarding Diu but could not succeed to inflict any appreciable damage to its fortification. On March 1, 1531 Nuno da Cunha left for Goa, leaving a subordinate officer, who systematically destroyed Mahuva, Ghogha, Valsad, Mahim, Kelva, Agashi and Surat. As Gujarat fell to the Mughal Empire, Bahadur Shah was forced to court the Portuguese. On 23 December 1534 while on board the galleon St. Mattheus he signed the Treaty of Bassein. Based on the terms of the agreement, the Portuguese Empire gained control of the city of Bassein (Vasai), as well as its territories, islands, and seas which included Daman and Bombay islands too. He had granted them leave to erect a factory in Diu. Instead of a factory the Portuguese built a Diu Fort. When he recovered his kingdom, Bah√°dur, repenting of his alliance with the Portuguese, went to Sorath to persuade an army of Portuguese, whom he had asked to come to his assistance, to return to Goa. In February 1537, when the Portuguese arrived at Diu, five or six thousand strong, the Sult√°n hoping to get rid of them by stratagem, went to Diu and endeavored to get the viceroy into his power. The viceroy excused himself, and in return invited the king to visit his ship anchored off the coast of Gujarat. Bah√°dur agreed, and on his way back was attacked and killed by the Portuguese and his body was dumped into the Arabian Sea.The Cambridge history of the British Empire, Volume 2 by Arthur Percival Newton p.14 He was then thirty one years old and in the eleventh year of his reign. According to the author of the MirƒÉt-i-Sikandari the reason of Bah√°dur's assassination was that a paper from him to the kings of the Deccan, inviting them to join him in an alliance against the Portuguese, had fallen into the hands of the Portuguese viceroy. Whatever may have been the provocation or the intention, the result seems to show that while both sides had treacherous designs neither party was able to carry out his original plan, and the end was unpremeditated, hurried on by mutual suspicions. These events were followed by the 1538 Siege of Diu which resulted in the permanent occupation of Diu by Portuguese which lasted till 1961. =His Sultanate= Up to the defeat of Sult√°n Bah√°dur by Hum√°y√∫n, the power of Gujar√°t was at its height. Cadets of noble R√°jput houses, Prithir√°j, the nephew of R√°na S√°nga of Chitor, and Narsingh Deva the cousin of the R√°ja of Gw√°lior, were proud to enroll themselves as the Sult√°n's vassals. The R√°ja of Bagl√°n readily gave Bah√°dur Sh√°h his daughter. J√°m F√≠r√∫z of Thatta in Sindh and the sons of Bahl√∫l Lodhi were suppliants at his court. M√°lwa was a dependency of Gujar√°t and the Niz√°m Sh√°his of Ahmednagar and Nas√≠rkhan of Burh√°npur acknowledged him as overlord, while the F√°r√∫kis of Kh√°ndesh were dependent on Bah√°dur's constant help. He built the mausoleum at Halol in honour of his brothers and predecessors, Sikandar Shah and Mahmud Shah II. He was a great patron of the Hindustani Classical music and its artists, including Baiju Bawra. Succession Bahadur had no son, hence there was some uncertainty regarding succession after his death. Muhammad Zaman Mirza, the fugitive Mughal prince made his claim on the ground that Bahadur's mother adopted him as her son. The nobles selected Bahadur's nephew Miran Muhammad Shah of Khandesh as his successor, but he died on his way to Gujarat. Finally, the nobles selected Mahmud Khan, the son of Bahadur's brother Latif Khan as his successor and he ascended to the throne as Mahmud Shah III on May 10, 1538.

Different packages of analytical techniques are available in six product lines.STATISTICA Product Overview  History  Statistica originally derives from a set of software packages and add-ons that were initially developed during the mid-1980s by StatSoft. Following the 1986 release of Complete Statistical System (CSS) and the 1988 release of Macintosh Statistical System (MacSS), the first DOS version (trademarked in capitals as STATISTICA) was released in 1991. In 1992, the Macintosh version of Statistica was released. Statistica 5.0 was released in 1995. It ran on both the new 32-bit Windows 95/NT and the older version of Windows (3.1). It featured many new statistics and graphics procedures, a word-processor-style output editor (combining tables and graphs), and a built-in development environment that enabled the user to easily design new procedures (e.g., via the included Statistica Basic language) and integrate them with the Statistica system. Statistica 5.1 was released in 1996 followed by Statistica CA '97 and Statistica '98 editions. In 2001, Statistica 6 was based on the COM architecture and it included multithreading and support for distributed computing. Statistica 9 was released in 2009, supporting 32 bit and 64-bit computing. Statistica 10 was released in November 2010. This release featured further performance optimizations for the 64-bit CPU architecture, as well as multithreading technologies, integration with Microsoft Sharepoint, Microsoft Office 2010 and other applications, the ability to generate Java and C# code, and other GUI and kernel improvements. Statistica 12 was released in April 2013 and features a new GUI, performance improvements when handling large amounts of data, a new visual analytic workspace, a new database query tool as well as several analytics enhancements.

Brushing actions (interactive labeling, marking, and data exclusion) allow for investigation of outliers and exploratory data analysis.  User interface  Operation of the software typically involves loading a table of data and applying statistical functions from pull-down menus or (in versions starting from 9.0) from the ribbon bar. The menus then prompt for the variables to be included and the type of analysis required. It is not necessary to type command prompts. Each analysis may include graphical or tabular output and is stored in a separate workbook.

Arder√≠us studied in Madrid before taking engineering courses at the University of Li√®ge. He abandoned these studies to dedicate himself to literature and leftist politics, and was jailed many times for his revolutionary activities during the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera. In 1927, Arder√≠us founded the very successful periodical Oriente. He also edited, together with Antonio Espina and Jos√© D√≠az Fern√°ndez, the political periodical Nueva Espa√±a from 1930 to 1931, with an initial print run of 40,000 copies. In 1929, he became affiliated with the Communist Party of Spain, but after 1933, he became aligned with the Republican Left. His novels include: Mis mendigos (1915); the Nietzschean As√≠ me fecund√≥ Zaratustra (1923); the erotic Yo y tres mujeres (\\"I and Three Women\\") (1924); La duquesa de Nit (1926); La espuela (1927); Los pr√≠ncipes iguales (1928); Justo (1929), a satire on Roman Catholicism; El comedor de la pensi√≥n Venecia (1930); the political Campesinos (1931), and Crimen (1934). With Jos√© D√≠az Fern√°ndez, he wrote Vida de Ferm√≠n Gal√°n (\\"Life of Ferm√≠n Gal√°n\\") (1931). During the Spanish Civil War, he served as president of the Antifascist organization Socorro Rojo Internacional, composed of unions, workers‚Äô organizations, and leftist political parties, which supported the Republican cause against Francisco Franco. Arder√≠us went into exile in 1939, first to France and then Mexico, after Adolf Hitler's occupation of Paris. He worked for the embassy of the Spanish Republic there, and later in the Mexican Ministry of National Education. During his exile, he abandoned the writing of novels, and instead wrote a biography of Don Juan de Austria. Though they were considered too difficult to be commercially successful, Arder√≠us‚Äô novels are currently being reexamined for their influence on other anti-Franco modernists and post-modernist novelists.

It has a population of 1233 (2005). According to the local tourist information officer, this is the site referred to in what may be the first written mention of present-day Slovak territory. This version of events states that in 172 AD Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius had fought a victorious battle in Hronsk√Ω Be≈àadik when it started 'raining fire'. The panic this created in his forces led some of the closet Christians among them to start praying, after which the deluge abated and Marcus Aurelius cut short his campaign. The incident was later recorded in the emperor's own memoirs. Geography It is situated in the Hron valley between the mountains Pohronsk√Ω Inovec and ≈†tiavnick√© vrchy, located around 40 km east of Nitra and 120 km north-east of Bratislava. History The territory of the village has been settled since the Neolithic and Hallstatt period, but it is best known for a very important Benedictine abbey, which played in important role in the Christianization process and in the development of culture and education. It was founded in 1075 by King G√©za I under the name \\"Monasterium Ecclesia Sancti Benedicti\\". The Nitra Gospels, the oldest Latin book (i.e. not just text) from the territory of Slovakia, were written here around 1100. The abbey ceased operations during the 16th century in the course of the Ottoman expansion in present-day Hungary. The church of the monastery contains valuable works of art (a wood-carving of the Holy Sepulchre, a wall-painting presenting the legend of St. George, an altar depicting the Passion, a sculpture of Jesus Christ from the 13th century, a Madonna sculpture from the 14th century, etc.). The abbey was declared a National Cultural Monument in 1945. The village below the abbey arose in the 14th century and received a city charter (town privileges) in 1347, but was destroyed by the Turks (Ottomans) in 1599 and later re-built. Demographics According to the 2001 census, the village had 1,220 inhabitants. 98.44% of inhabitants were Slovaks, 0.41% Roma, 0.33% Hungarians and 0.25% Czechs. The religious make-up was 91.89% Roman Catholics, 3.28% people with no religious affiliation and 0.90% Lutherans.

The Vignemale is the name given to the mountain massif in French, which also straddles into Spain.

KhƒÅlid ibn Jabalah () in later Islamic sources),.. was a king of the Ghassanids, pre- Islamic Arabs who lived on the eastern frontier of the Byzantine Empire. The fifth Ghassanid ruler of that name, he reigned from to 569, the longest of any Christian arab ruler and played a major role in the Roman‚ÄìPersian Wars and the affairs of the Syriac Orthodox Church. For his services to Byzantium, he was made patrikios and vir gloriosissimus. Biography =Early life= Harith was the son of Jabalah IV (Gabalas in Greek sources) and brother of Abu Karib (Abocharabus), phylarch of Palaestina Salutaris.; . He became ruler of the Ghassanids and phylarch of Arabia Petraea and Palaestina Secunda probably in 528, following the death of his father in the Battle of Thannuris. Soon after () he was raised by the Byzantine emperor Justinian I (r. 527‚Äì565), in the words of the historian Procopius, \\"to the dignity of king\\", becoming the overall commander of all the Empire's Arab allies in the East with the title (\\"patrician and phylarch of the Saracens\\"). His actual area of control, however, may initially have been limited to the northeastern part of Byzantium's Arab frontier..... At the time, the Byzantines and their Arab allies were engaged in the Iberian War against the Sasanian Empire and their Arab clients, the Lakhmids, and Justinian's move was designed to create a counterpart to the powerful Lakhmid ruler, Mundhir, who controlled the Arab tribes allied to the Persians.. =Military career= The Byzantine Diocese of the East. A number of Arab tribes under their phylarchs were settled as foederati in the various provinces. With the elevation of Harith to the kingship, the Ghassanids, based in Palaestina II, became paramount among them.. In this capacity, Harith fought on behalf of the Byzantines in all their numerous wars against Persia. Already in 528 he was one of the commanders sent in a punitive expedition against Mundhir... In 529, he helped suppress the wide-scale Samaritan revolt, capturing 20,000 boys and girls whom he sold as slaves. It was perhaps Harith's successful participation in this conflict that led Justinian to promote him to supreme phylarch.. It is possible that he took part with his men in the Byzantine victory in the Battle of Dara in 530, although no source explicitly mentions him.. In 531, he led a 5000-strong Arab contingent in the Battle of Callinicum. Procopius, a source hostile to the Ghassanid ruler, states that the Arabs, stationed on the Byzantine right, betrayed the Byzantines and fled, costing them the battle. John Malalas, however, whose record is generally more reliable, reports that while some Arabs indeed fled, Harith stood firm.; . The charge of treason leveled by Procopius against Harith seems to be further undermined by the fact that, unlike Belisarius, he was retained in command and was active in operations around Martyropolis later in the year.. In 537/538 or 539, he clashed with Mundhir of the Lakhmids over grazing rights on the lands south of Palmyra, near the old Strata Diocletiana.; . According to later accounts by al-Tabari, the Ghassanid ruler invaded Mundhir's territory and carried off rich booty. The Sasanian emperor, Khosrow I (r. 531‚Äì579), used this dispute as a pretext for restarting hostilities with the Byzantines, and renewed war broke out in 540. In the campaign of 541, Harith and his men, accompanied by 1200 Byzantines under generals John the Glutton and Trajan, were sent by Belisarius into a raid into Assyria. The expedition was successful, penetrated far into enemy territory and gathered much plunder. At some point, however, the Byzantine contingent was sent back, and subsequently Harith failed to either meet up with or inform Belisarius of his whereabouts. According to Procopius's account, this, in addition to the outbreak of a disease among the army, forced Belisarius to withdraw. Procopius further alleges that this was done deliberately so that the Arabs would not have to share their plunder. In his Secret History, however, Procopius gives a different account of Belisarius's inaction, completely unrelated to the Ghassanid ruler.; . In , Harith was involved in armed conflict with another Arab phylarch, al-Aswad, known in Greek as Asouades.. From on, while the two great empires were at peace in Mesopotamia after the truce of 545, the conflict between their Arab allies continued. In a sudden raid, Mundhir captured one of Harith's sons and had him sacrificed. Soon after, however, the Lakhmids suffered a heavy defeat in a pitched battle between the two Arab armies.; ; . The conflict continued, with Mundhir staging repeated raids into Syria. In one of these raids, in June 554, Harith met him in the decisive battle of Yawm Halima (the \\"Day of Halima\\"), celebrated in pre-Islamic Arab poetry, near Chalcis, at which the Lakhmids were defeated. Mundhir fell in the field, but Harith also lost his eldest son Jabalah.; . In November 563, Harith visited Emperor Justinian in Constantinople, to discuss his succession and the raids against his domains by the Lakhmid ruler Amr ibn Hind, who was eventually bought off with subsidies.; . He certainly left a vivid impression in the imperial capital, not least by his physical presence: John of Ephesus records that years later, the Emperor Justin II (r. 565‚Äì578), who had descended into madness, was frightened and went to hide himself when he was told \\"Arethas is coming for you\\".. =Death= When al-Harith died in 569 during a supposed earthquake,. he was succeeded by his son al-Mundhir III ibn al-Harith ( Fl√°vios Alam√∫ndaros in Byzantine sources). Taking advantage of this, the new Lakhmid ruler Qabus ibn al-Mundhir launched an attack, but was decisively defeated... Religious policies In contrast to his Byzantine overlords, Harith was a staunch Miaphysite and rejected the Council of Chalcedon. Throughout his rule, al- Harith supported the anti-Chalcedonian tendencies in the region of Syria, presiding over church councils and engaging in theology, contributing actively to the Miaphysite church's revival during the sixth century.. Thus in 542, following two decades of persecutions which had decapitated the Miaphysite leadership, he appealed for the appointment of new Miaphysite bishops in Syria to the Empress Theodora, whose own Miaphysite leanings were well-known. Theodora then appointed Jacob Baradaeus and Theodore as bishops. Jacob in particular would prove a very capable leader, converting pagans and greatly expanding and strengthening the organization of the Miaphysite church.

OAPEC's primary objective is safeguarding the cooperation of numerous members in various aspects of economic activity within the oil industry as well as maintaining strong relations among themselves; to provide legitimate means to preserve the members' individual and collective efforts within the industry; unite on-going efforts for the procurement of oil; provide access to consumer markets on fair and reasonable terms; and provide conditions, adequate capital, and experience of investors in the oil industry. History breakup of Sudan On 9 January 1968, three of the then‚Äìmost conservative Arab oil states -- Kuwait, Libya, and Saudi Arabia -- agreed at a conference in Beirut, Lebanon to found the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries, aiming to separate the production and sale of oil from politics in the wake of the halfhearted 1967 oil embargo in response to the Six-Day War. Such use of the economic weapon of oil embargo in the struggle against Israel had been regularly proposed at Arab Petroleum Congresses, but it took the Six-Day War for the embargo to happen. However Saudi Arabia's oil production was up by 9% that year, and the main embargo lasted only ten days and was completely ended by the Khartoum Conference. OAPEC was originally intended to be a conservative Arab political organization which, by restricting membership to countries whose main export was oil, would exclude governments seen as radical -- such as those of Egypt and Algeria. This organizational exclusivity was bolstered by an additional rule in the organization's charter requiring the three founders' approval of all new members. The original aim was to control the economic weapon of potential oil embargo and prevent its use caused by popular emotion. Iraq initially declined to join, preferring to work under the umbrella of the Arab League, considering OAPEC too conservative. Equally the three founders considered Iraq too radical to be desirable as a member. However, by early 1972, the criterion for admission had changed to oil being a significant source of revenue (rather than the principal source) of a prospective member nation; and Algeria, Iraq, Syria and Egypt had been admitted. Consequently, OAPEC became a much more activist organization, contrary to the original intention. The 1973 oil crisis was a turning point for the organization. In October of that year, the forces of Egypt and Syria attempted to overwhelm the state of Israel in an offensive later known as the Yom Kippur War. On 16 October, ten days after the war's start, Kuwait hosted separate meetings of both OAPEC and the Persian Gulf members of OPEC, including Iran. OAPEC resolved to cut oil production by 5% monthly \\"until the Israeli forces are completely evacuated from all the Arab territories occupied in the June 1967 war\\". The embargo would last for some five months before it was lifted in March 1974 after negotiations at the Washington Oil Summit. The embargo's after-effects would linger through the rest of the decade and beyond. For the oil-exporting countries, the embargo was the first experience of leveraging their collective production for political gains. A number of the member nations would use this sense of control to renegotiate the contracts they had made with the companies that had discovered and exploited their resources. The vastly increased revenues would prove addictive, and a unified OAPEC oil embargo was never again possible. In 1979 Egypt was expelled from OAPEC for signing the Camp David Accords, although it was readmitted a decade later. In 1982 the Arab League's Arab Petroleum Congress (founded in 1959) merged into OAPEC's Arab Energy Conference (founded in 1979), which has continued to meet periodically through at least 2014. OAPEC is regarded as a regional, specialized international organization focusing on organizing cooperation in oil development, collective projects, and regional integration.  Organizational structure  The Judicial Tribunal mitigates disputes between member states; interpretations of the OAPEC Agreement; disputes with a petroleum company operating in its member states' territory, and anything else that falls into OAPEC's jurisdiction or that the Council of Ministers submits to the tribunal. The Judicial Tribunal must unevenly consist of at least seven and no more than eleven judges from Arab countries. The tribunal's judgments are final and binding, and will be enforceable within the territories of residing members.

Zero Point was later renamed Noor Hossain Square and the anniversary of his death is officially commemorated each year as Shohid Noor Hossain Day. He is one of the most widely known martyrs of Bangladesh's pro-democracy movement.  Early life  Hossain's ancestral home on his father's side was in the village of Jhatibunia, which is located in Mathbaria Upazila, Pirojpur District. His father was an autorickshaw operator. His family moved to 79/1 Banagram Road, Dhaka after the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. Noor Hossain attended Radhasundari Primary School, which was also on Banagram Road. When he was in 8th grade at Graduate High School, Dhaka, Hossain quit school because of poverty. He was admitted to a motor driving school and received training in driving like his father. Interested in politics, Hossain became the publicity secretary of the Banagram unit committee of Dhaka City Joubo League. He was neither well-off nor highly educated but he embodied the struggle of common people of the country, and has become a public symbol. Dhaka Siege On November 10, 1987, political opponents came together for what they called a \\"Dhaka Siege\\" (Dhaka Blockade) to demand an end to the rule of President Hussain Muhammad Ershad based on violations of democracy. Although he had been in power since 1982 through a coup d'√©tat, he won the October 1987 election but opponents charged it was a fraud. The Awami League and Bangladesh National Party united in opposition against Ershad's rule. One opposition demand was an election of the National Assembly under a non-partisan caretaker government. The rally turned violent and several leaders and protester Noor Hossain were killed under riot conditions, as well as several hundred injured at the time. Noor Hossain was among three Jubo League members killed at a protest rally. The other two were leaders Nurul Huda Babul and Aminul Huda Tito. In the aftermath, the opposition called for a nationwide protest strike on November 11 and 12. Hossain is now associated in Bangladesh with anti-autocracy and pro-democracy. At the time he was shot, his body carried several slogans in white paint. He wore the slogan \\"Down with autocracy\\" (Sairachar nipat jak) on his chest, and on his back, he had written the slogan \\"Let Democracy Be Free\\" (Ganatantra mukti pak). His death raised the visibility of opposition sentiment directed against the Ershad government. Ershad was removed from office December 6, 1990 as a result of the mass movement that grew from the Dhaka Siege. After Ershad was out of office, Khaleda Zia of the BNP was elected as Bangladesh's first female Prime Minister and a year later the government established a national date to commemorate the event. It was first called \\"Historic November 10 observance\\" but the Awami League supported the phrase \\"Noor Hossain Day\\", by which it is known today. Ershad's Jatiya Party became part of the Awami League coalition after his removal, and later Ershad apologized for Hossain's death. The Jatiya Party does commemorate the day but refers to it as \\"Democracy Day\\" (Bengali: Ganatantra Dibash). Noor Hossain and the square remained significant for protesters after Hossian's death in 1987 and Ershad's removal in 1990. In 1993, the Awami League led protesters to the square on the occasion of the November 10 anniversary against the BNP government, which also provoked a reaction from the police. In 1996, Ershad officially apologized for Hossain's death before parliament and also to Hossain's father. Ershad maintained his apology but also criticized the opposition in using Hossain as a symbol against his government. In 2012, he said, \\"You (the opposition) came up with dead bodies as they were needed to spark demonstrations.\\" Accounts and reactions Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has given her own account of Hossain's death: \\"I remember what happened on that day. Noor Hossain was standing beside me when we took out our procession. I called him and told him they would kill him for what he had inscribed on his chest. Then he brought his head near the window of my car and said, 'Sister, you just bless me. I will sacrifice my life to free democracy.\\" Hasina also said, \\"Bangladesh got back the rights to vote and food in exchange of Shaheed Nur Hossain‚Äôs supreme sacrifice.\\" Marium Bibi, Hossain's mother, has most recently said, \\"I still don‚Äôt see anything for which my son died.\\" In an earlier interview, she said, \\"It is hard for any mother to lose her son. But I have no sorrows... I am proud of Noor.\\" In popular culture The event of his death is honored each year as cultural and political organizations sponsor special programs for observance the day. The day is officially commemorated as Shohid Noor Hossain Day in Bangladesh. Photographs of Noor Hossain wearing slogans on his chest taken by Dinu Alam and back taken by Pavel Rahaman were taken shortly before his death and become an important visual icon in Bangladesh representing the struggle for democracy. A postage stamp was issued by Bangladesh in honor of his martyrdom. Hossain is the subject of the Bengali film Buk tar Bangladesher hridoy.

Severin is noted for his work in retracing the legendary journeys of historical figures. Severin was awarded both the Gold Medal of the Royal Geographical Society and the Livingstone Medal of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society. He received the Thomas Cook Travel Book Award for his 1982 book The Sindbad Voyage. Early life and career He was born Timothy Severin in Assam, India in 1940. Severin attended Tonbridge School and studied geography and history at Keble College, Oxford. Recreating ancient voyages =Tracking Marco Polo (1961)= While he was an undergraduate at Oxford University, Severin, Stanley Johnson and Michael de Larrabeiti retraced Marco Polo's thirteenth-century journey through Asia on motorcycles, using Polo's The Description of the World as a guide. They travelled from Oxford via Switzerland to Venice, through Turkey, Persia and Afghanistan, surviving sandstorms, floods, motorcycle accidents, and time spent in jail. Severin and his guides rode camels through the Deh Bakri pass to identify the Persian \\"apples of Paradise\\" and the hidden hot springs described by Polo. They were unable to complete the voyage due to visa problems at the border of China and returned to England by sea from Bombay. =Explorers of the Mississippi (1967)= From conquistadors to nineteenth-century gentlemen explorers, Severin follows the routes and tells the stories of the adventurers who have travelled along the US river the Mississippi for hundreds of years, and does so while navigating the length of the river by canoe and launch. =The Brendan Voyage (1976‚Äì1977)= It is theorized by some scholars, that the Latin texts of Navigatio Sancti Brendani Abbatis (The Voyage of St Brendan the Abbot) dating back to at least 800 AD tell the story of Brendan's (c. 489‚Äì583) seven-year voyage across the Atlantic Ocean to a new land and his return. Convinced that the legend was based in historical truth, in 1976 Severin built a replica of Brendan's currach. Handcrafted using traditional tools, the 36-foot (11 m), two masted boat was built of Irish ash and oak, hand-lashed together with nearly two miles (3 km) of leather thong, wrapped with 49 traditionally tanned ox hides, and sealed with wool grease. Between May 1976 and June 1977, Severin and his crew sailed the Brendan 4,500 miles (7,200 km) from Ireland to Peckford Island, Newfoundland, stopping at the Hebrides, the Faroe Islands and Iceland en route. He considered that his recreation of the voyage helped to identify the bases for many of the legendary elements of the story: the \\"Island of Sheep\\", the \\"Paradise of Birds\\", \\"Crystal Towers\\", \\"mountains that hurled rocks at voyagers\\", and the \\"Promised Land\\". Severin's account of the expedition, The Brendan Voyage, became an international best seller, translated into 16 languages. The boat is now featured at the Craggaunowen open-air museum in County Clare, Ireland. =The Sindbad Voyage (1980‚Äì1981)= The famous adventures of the medieval sailor Sindbad, as recorded in One Thousand and One Nights, became the inspiration for Severin's next voyage. After three years of researching the legend and early Arab and Persian sketches of medieval ships, he brought the project to Sur, Oman in 1980. Sponsored by Qaboos bin Said al Said, Sultan of Oman, he guided Omani shipwrights in the construction of the \\"Sohar\\", an 87-foot (26.5 m) replica of a ninth-century, lateen-rigged, cotton-sailed Arab dhow. The ship was constructed in seven months of hand-sawn wooden planks sewn together with nearly 400 miles (640 km) of hand-rolled, coconut-husk rope. Sohar left Oman on 21 November 1980. Navigating by the stars, Severin and his crew of 25 travelled nearly 6,000 miles (9,600 km) in eight months. From Sur they sailed east across the Arabian Sea, south down India's Malabar Coast to Lakshadweep and on to Calicut, India. The next phase of their voyage took them down the coast of India to Sri Lanka. They were becalmed in the doldrums for nearly a month, suffered broken spars, and were nearly run down by freighters, but arrived in Guangzhou, China on 6 July. =The Jason Voyage (1984)= The epic poem Argonautica, first written down by Apollonius of Rhodes in Alexandria in the late 3rd century BC, became the basis for Severin's next expedition. He began his research into ancient Greek ships and the details of the text in 1981. Master shipwright Vasilis Delimitros of Spetses hand built a 54-foot (16.5 m) replica of a Bronze Age galley based on a scale model of the Argo. In 1984, with twenty volunteer oarsmen, Severin rowed and sailed from northern Greece through the Dardanelles, crossed the Marmara Sea, and passed through the Straits of Bosphorus to the Black Sea, reaching the Phasis delta in then- Soviet Georgia: a voyage of 1,500 miles (2,400 km). Along the way they identified some of the landmarks visited by Jason and his Argonauts, and found a possible explanation for the legend of the Golden Fleece. Severin recounted the expedition in The Jason Voyage (1985). =The Ulysses Voyage (1985)= Once again making use of the Argo from The Jason Voyage, in 1985 Severin followed the route of Ulysses' voyage home in The Odyssey, from Troy to Ithaca in the Ionian islands. Along the way, Severin made tentative or conclusive identifications of The land of the Lotus-eaters, King Nestor's palace, the Halls of Hades, the Roving Rocks, Scylla and Charybdis, and also the sirens. The Ulysses Voyage, published in 1987, tells the story of the expedition, the historical research that went into it, and the discoveries Severin and his crew made along the way. =By Horse to Jerusalem (1987/88)= Nine hundred years after the First Crusade, Tim Severin and Sarah Dorman set out on horseback to follow the 2500 mile route of Duke Godfrey of Boullion and other Crusaders from Belgium to Jerusalem, travelling through the modern lands of Germany, Austria, Hungary, Yugoslavia (itself today consigned to history), Bulgaria, Turkey and Syria. The horses chosen were a riding school palfrey (Mystery) and a Heavy Ardennes (Carty), the latter a descendant of the war horses of Crusader cavalry ‚Äì what Severin called ‚Äòthe Main Battle Tank‚Äô of its day. This journey, after many years of marine expeditions was a return to long distance land exploration by Severin. The Journey would take place over 2 years with the horses and riders resting over the winter of 1987/8. Severin was unable to follow exactly the route of Duke Godfrey due to the civil war in the Lebanon, instead routing through Syria and Jordan to reach Jerusalem. =In Search of Genghis Khan (1990)= While still a student at the University of Oxford, Severin wrote his thesis on the first European travellers in Central Asia during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. With this background, to commemorate the 800th birthday of Genghis Khan he rode with Mongol herdsmen along the route once used by couriers of the Mongolian empire, mingled with camel herders in the Gobi Desert, and ate with Kazakhs in their yurts. His story, part travelogue, part research paper, was published in 1993 under the title In Search of Genghis Khan. =The China Voyage (May‚ÄìNovember 1993)= Ancient Chinese texts tell the story of Hsu Fu, a navigator and explorer sent by the first Emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang, in 218 BC into the \\"Eastern Ocean\\" in search of life-prolonging drugs. Hsu Fu completed the voyage on a bamboo raft, which some believe took him to America and back. Severin set out to prove that such a voyage could have been made. On the beach at Sam Son, Vietnam, he oversaw the construction of a 60-foot (18.3 m) long, 15-foot (4.6 m) wide raft built of 220 bamboos and rattan cording, and driven by an 800 square foot (74 square metre), junk-rigged sail. After leaving Asia in May 1993, Severin and his crew faced monsoons, pirates and typhoons before the rattan began rotting and the raft began falling apart in the mid-Pacific. After travelling 5,500 miles (8,850 km) in 105 days, they were forced to abandon the raft about 1,000 miles (1,600 km) short of their destination. Although the Hsu Fu, as the craft was named, did not complete the trip, Severin believed the voyage had accomplished its purpose. In The China Voyage, published in 1994, he wrote that the expedition had proved that a bamboo raft of the second century BC could have made a voyage across the Pacific, just as Hsu Fu's account recorded. =In Search of Moby Dick: Quest for the White Whale (1999)= Following the path of the Pequod, Severin sets out to find a living, white sperm whale. His quest takes him to the remotest parts of the South Pacific: the Philippine island of Pamilacan, whose people hunt whale sharks with their hands and grappling hooks and the Indonesian island of Lamalera, whose people hunt sperm whales with harpoons from open boats. Throughout his expedition, Severin is able to compare Melville's account with the reality he discovers, and to show that much of Melville's material was either borrowed or fabricated. Fiction Severin has also written historical fiction. The Viking Series, first published in 2005, concerns a young Viking adventurer who travels the world. In 2007 he published The Adventures of Hector Lynch series set in the late 17th century about a 17-year-old Corsair.

It is also the second and last game to feature the ESPN branding on its front cover (the ESPN branding would be dropped, making later releases once again known as simply \\"NBA 2Kx\\" and later \\"NBA 2Kxx\\".). The game strives to realistically depict the experience of basketball, more specifically, the National Basketball Association. Players mainly play NBA basketball games in a variety of game modes with real players and teams as well as customizable players. A mode focusing on street basketball is present, as is a mode where the player simulates through a team's NBA season. The game features several aesthetical details, such as crowd animations, camera angles, and commentary. ESPN NBA 2K5 received positive reviews from critics upon release. The visuals and gameplay were widely acclaimed, while the 24/7 and Association game modes received a mixed response. The low price of the game was also well received. Gameplay ESPN NBA 2K5 is a basketball simulation video game which strives to emulate the National Basketball Association. Players mostly play in basketball games in several game modes, with real teams, such as the Detroit Pistons and Boston Celtics. Gameplay follows the rules and objectives of basketball and the game is presented like televised NBA games. Several game modes are available; 24/7 mode allows the player to create their own player, Association mode allows the player to play through an NBA season with a selected team, another mode lets the player compete in basketball tournaments, and a mode where the player plays street basketball is also available. The game features Stuart Scott as a presenter, Bob Fitzgerald and Bill Walton as commentators, and Michele Tafoya as a sideline reporter. The player may customize several aspects of the game, and many aesthetical details are present.\\"ESPN NBA 2K5 First Impression\\" (September 14, 2004). GameSpot.

Development and release In the NBA 2K series, ESPN NBA 2K5 is the successor to ESPN NBA Basketball, and the predecessor to NBA 2K6. It was developed by Visual Concepts and published by both Sega and Global Star Software. It was released for Xbox on September 28, 2004, with a PlayStation 2 version following on September 30, both for North America. In European regions, both versions of the game were released on February 4, 2005. NBA 2K3, ESPN NBA Basketball, and ESPN NBA 2K5 are the only games in the series to feature ESPN licensing. Ben Wallace of the Detroit Pistons is the cover athlete. The first five games in the series featured Allen Iverson of the Philadelphia 76ers on the covers. ESPN NBA 2K5 is the last NBA 2K game to be released by Sega before the company sold Visual Concepts to Take Two Interactive, forming 2K Sports. Reception ESPN NBA 2K5 received \\"favorable\\" reviews on both platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Andrew Reiner of Game Informer praised Visual Concepts for still being able to make subtle improvements over the previous game in the series, despite not implementing drastic overhauls, as was the case with ESPN NBA Basketball and NBA 2K3. He commended how the developers focus on realism; one detail he cited was the sweat players amass as games progress. Reiner called the crowd design \\"amazing\\", particularly liking how they react to certain situations, and the said that player models were \\"superb\\". Reiner summarized his review by saying, \\"This is still the best playing, most rewarding, and realistic basketball game that money can buy.\\" Game Revolution's review praised the visuals and price, but criticized the 24/7 mode for being \\"broken\\". Bob Colayco of GameSpot also praised the low price of the game, as well as the \\"extremely well done\\" gameplay and visuals. He found the soundtrack \\"forgettable\\" and thought the commentary was \\"good but not great\\". Both of GameZone's two reviews were positive. They praised the online features, the 24/7 mode, the commentary and soundtrack, the visuals, and the gameplay. IGN's Hilary Goldstein wrote: \\"ESPN NBA 2K5 isn't a horrible game by any means, but it's probably Sega's weakest sports game this year. On the surface it looks fine. It plays decently and if you know how to use IsoMotion2, you can definitely enjoy playing offense. There's a lot of fine- tuning needed and it seems pretty clear this game really shouldn't be shipping quite so soon. I just couldn't possibly play any more of the Association. It's not bad, it just isn't great and some of the AI gaffs began to really get on my nerves over time. However, the 24/7 mode is refreshing, even after playing a lot last year. Considering this is a $20 game, it's certainly worth it to pick up just for those nice extra modes. However, if you want to play a real NBA sim, this one may disappoint you. It's too drive-minded and while it tries to create the idea of individuals and personality with the visuals and Association, the gameplay seems to ignore who these players are on the court. I want this to be a great game. I know a lot of other people do as well. But it just isn't great. It's merely good. And in the competitive world of sports sims these days, being good isn't enough.\\" By July 2006, the PlayStation 2 version of ESPN NBA 2K5 had sold 1 million copies and earned $20 million in the United States. Next Generation ranked it as the 57th highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, or GameCube between January 2000 and July 2006 in the United States. Combined console sales of ESPN NBA 2K5 reached 1.6 million units in the United States by July 2006.

Image courtesy of NOAA's Office of Ocean Exploration and Research, 2016 Deepwater Exploration of the Marianas. Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR) is a division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). OAR is also referred to as NOAA Research. NOAA Research is the research and development arm of NOAA and is the driving force behind NOAA environmental products and services aimed at protecting life and property and promoting sustainable economic growth. Research, conducted by programs within NOAA and through collaborations outside NOAA, focuses on enhancing the understanding of environmental phenomena such as tornadoes, hurricanes, climate variability, changes in the ozone layer, El Ni√±o/La Ni√±a events, fisheries productivity, ocean currents, deep sea thermal vents, and coastal ecosystem health. The origins of NOAA Research date back more than 200 years with the creation of the Survey of the Coast in 1807 by Thomas Jefferson. The Coast Survey, which became the U.S. Lake Survey office in 1841, was developed to undertake \\"a hydrographic survey of northwestern [Great] lakes.\\" Research executed by the scientists of this group was innovative and holistic: the first current meters were developed to understand water flow rates, and forecasting techniques were greatly enhanced to predict water levels and the relationship to lakefront property. The same traits of world class, long-term research continue to define NOAA Research today. The science and technology that NOAA Research produces is not only relevant to society, it anticipates and responds to partners‚Äô needs to demonstrates the value of technologies so that partners can deploy them into their applications. OAR works with end- users to integrate mature technologies (and associated expertise) into larger systems, either in NOAA operations or partner applications, via testbeds, patents, etc. Organization NOAA Research is an open research network consisting of seven federal research laboratories, six program offices, sixteen Cooperative Institutes (which are non-federal, non-profit research institutions in 5-10 year collaborative partnerships with NOAA), and 33 university based Sea Grant programs. OAR also relies on work performed at numerous public, private, and academic institutions. Through its laboratories, programs, and external partners, OAR seeks to balance the activities that benefit from the long-term, dedicated capabilities of federal facilities with those that require the diverse expertise of our university partners. The components and programs of NOAA Research are: * 7 NOAA laboratories * 16 Cooperative Institutes * NOAA Climate Program Office * Office of Weather and Air Quality * NOAA Office of Ocean Exploration and Research * NOAA National Sea Grant Program * NOAA Unmanned Aircraft Systems * NOAA Ocean Acidification Program OWAQ includes the Earth Prediction Innovation Center, created by Congress in 2018 to improve collaboration with academia and private companies.Earth Prediction Innovation Center Research activities NOAA Research has three primary research areas: Climate; Weather and Air Chemistry; and Oceans, Coasts, and the Great Lakes. Both in-house and external scientists: * Continue to conduct experiments to understand natural processes (physical, geochemical, ecological) * Build predictive models for use in weather, climate, solar, ocean, and coastal assessments and predictions. * Develop and deploy new observing technologies to provide data to support predictive models and to document natural variability. * Develop new analytical and forecast tools to improve weather services and earlier warnings for natural disasters. * Use new information technology to share information with other federal and academic scientists. * Prepare scientific assessments and information products to enhance public education and guide governmental action. Research plans and products are developed in partnership with academia and other federal agencies, and are peer-reviewed and widely distributed. A high premium is placed on external collaboration both domestically and internationally. =Climate Research= NOAA's research laboratories, the Climate Program Office, and research partners conduct research into complex climate systems and how they work. The aim of this research is to predict climate variation in the shorter term, for example, cold spells or periods of drought, and over longer terms, such as centuries and beyond. NOAA scientists are at the forefront of studying climate change and modeling what the effects will be on the Earth. Researchers at NOAA‚Äôs Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL) have developed the Coupled Hydrosphere-Atmosphere Research Model (CHARM) to enable a valid assessment of the impact of how climate change might affect the climate and ecology of the Great Lakes. The CHARM model provides a realistic surface-atmosphere feedback portrayal, and accounts for runoff from land surfaces. It allows researchers to predict that global warming likely will bring higher temperatures and increased precipitation to the Great Lakes. Development of a second generation of CHARM is underway to help answer questions about greenhouse warming effects on Great Lakes water quantity. NOAA researchers closely monitor the Earth's atmosphere searching for clues about long-term changes in the global climate. The data collected worldwide by NOAA researchers contributes to the understanding of complex climatic systems and the ability to forecast changes. =Weather and Air Chemistry Research= NOAA Research organizations conduct research on the upper and lower atmosphere as well as the space environment. Their findings form the basis for NOAA's contributions to major national and international environmental programs and agreements. For instance, improvements in forecast and warning services provided by the National Weather Service are a direct result of NOAA research. Improvements in numerical modeling, observations gathered by satellites and Doppler weather radars (NEXRAD), and sophisticated weather warning and information processing and communications systems, have collectively led to significantly improved severe weather forecasts and warnings. Other research programs focus on observation and study of the chemical and physical processes of the atmosphere, detecting the effects of pollution on those processes and monitoring and forecasting the phenomena affecting the Sun-Earth environment. =Oceans, Coasts & the Great Lakes Research= NOAA Research, in cooperation with its research partners, explores and investigates ocean habitats and resources. The findings of NOAA researchers contribute to the management of fisheries, conservation of coastlines, and development of a stronger economy through marine products and businesses, such as biotechnology and sustainable aquaculture. NOAA‚Äôs Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) in Seattle, Washington, designed Deep- ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis (DART-II) technology, which provides two-way communication capabilities, allowing engineers the ability to troubleshoot these systems from the lab and repair them remotely when possible. This capability minimizes system downtime, especially in the harsh winter conditions of the North Pacific, and reduces costs by not having to deploy a ship to make repairs. Goals NOAA research is intended to: * Provide comprehensive knowledge to guide national environmental policy decisions, including better predictions of the climate response to emissions changes, choices for protection of the ozone layer, and alternatives for developing coastal communities * Improve environmental services to the nation, including reliable predictions and assessments * Promote economic growth through science for decision-making, new technology, and partnerships with academia and industry Laboratories The 7 laboratories that are part of NOAA Research are located throughout the United States near their areas of focus. * Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) - Miami, FL * Air Resources Laboratory (ARL) - Silver Spring, MD * Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL) - Boulder, CO * Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) - Princeton, NJ * Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL) - Ann Arbor, MI * National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL) - Norman, OK * Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) - Seattle, WA and Newport, OR The NOAA Research Laboratories conduct an integrated program of research, technology development, and services to improve the understanding of Earth's atmosphere, oceans and inland waters, and to describe and predict changes occurring to them. The laboratories and their field stations are located across the country and around the world. The laboratories have established formal collaborative agreements with universities/non-profit research institutions to form joint research institutes that are centers of scientific excellence pertaining to the earth's oceans, inland waters, intermountain west, atmosphere, and arctic environment. Scientific reviews are conducted every five years to evaluate the quality, relevance, and performance of research conducted at the OAR laboratories. These reviews help to strategically position laboratories in their planning of future science and are intended to ensure that OAR laboratory research is linked to the NOAA Next Generation Strategic Plan, remains relevant to the NOAA research mission and its priorities, and is consistent with NOAA planning, programming, and budgeting processes.

These scratches and gouges were first recognized as the result of a moving glacier in the late 18th century when Swiss alpinists first associated them with moving glaciers. They also noted that if they were visible today that the glaciers must also be receding. Glacial striations are usually multiple, straight, and parallel, representing the movement of the glacier using rock fragments and sand grains, embedded in the base of the glacier, as cutting tools. Large amounts of coarse gravel and boulders carried along underneath the glacier provide the abrasive power to cut trough-like glacial grooves. Finer sediments also in the base of the moving glacier further scour and polish the bedrock surface, forming a glacial pavement. Ice itself is not a hard enough material to change the shape of rock but because the ice has rock embedded in the basal surface it can effectively abrade the bedrock. Most glacial striations were exposed by the retreat of glaciers since the Last Glacial Maximum or the more recent Little Ice Age. As well as indicating the direction of flow of the glacial ice, the depth and extent of weathering of the striations may be used to estimate the duration of post-glacier exposure of the rock. An outstanding example of glacial grooves can be found at the Glacial Grooves at Kelleys Island, Ohio (a National Natural Landmark), the most impressive of which is long, wide, and up to deep. These grooves cut into the Columbus Limestone. Striations cover the sides and bottoms of the grooves. Other examples of glacial striations can be found in the former path of the Moiry Glacier, south of Grimentz, Anniviers, Valais, Switzerland, alongside the present path of the glacier, north-east of the 2016 location of the tongue of the glacier (images). Factors which affect the rate of glacial abrasion The following affect the rate of abrasion: * The amount of rock debris in the basal surface of the ice. If there is no rock in the basal surface of the ice there will be no abrasion, but if there is too much rock in the basal surface of the ice the motion of the glacier will be affected, thus affecting abrasion rates. * As the bedrock is being worn away the abrading fragments within the glacier are also being worn. Similarly to sandpaper being worn away with use. A continued supply of abrading fragments is required to uphold a similar level of abrasion. * The fragments must be harder than the bedrock. Quartz fragments will abrade shale but shale fragments will not abrade a quartz rich bedrock. * A constant flow of melt water between the basal surface and the bedrock speeds abrasion. The meltwater constantly rinses away the rock flour allowing the coarser fragments to abrade bedrock. * Speed of the glacier. The faster the glacier moves, the faster the bedrock will be eroded. * Thickness of the ice. Thicker ice causes more downward force and increased pressure between the abrading fragments and the bedrock. There is a limit to how much ice will enhance abrasion. If the friction force between fragments and bedrock is too great the ice will flow around the fragments. * Basal meltwater under high pressure. If the meltwater is under sufficiently high pressure it will cause the ice to effectively buoy up and decrease the normal force of the ice on the bedrock. Another result of this is that the velocity of the glacier is increased. * Shape of the fragments. Larger more angular fragments will scratch and scour more effectively than small and round fragments will.

History Among the most memorable event in the chronicle of Saguday is June 21, 1959, the founding of this town as a regular municipality of then Province of Nueva Vizcaya by virtue of House Bill No. 2541, authored by Leonardo B. Perez, then Congressman of the Lone District of Nueva Vizcaya which pursuant to the provisions of Article VI, Section 20 (1) of the Philippine Constitution, became a law without the signature of President Carlos P. Garcia, entitled Republic Act No. 2519. Pursuant to Section 1 of this law, the seven barrios composing the Municipality of Saguday are as follows: La Paz, Saguday (now Rizal and Magsaysay), Salvacion, Santo Tomas which were separated from the Municipality of Diffun; while Dibul, Mangandingay and Tres Reyes were separated from the Municipality of Aglipay. Originally, Saguday was a barrio of the Municipality of Santiago, Isabela, however, upon the final settlement of the boundary dispute between Isabela and Nueva Vizcaya, Saguday became a regular barrio of Diffun by virtue of an Executive Order No. 386, issued by then President Elpidio Quirino. The naming of Saguday has no legendary story or folktale. It was named by Mr. Jose Cardenas of San Jose, Nueva Ecija, the grandfather of former Mayor Leandro G. Cardenas who came to visit his kins in Saguday. The word Saguday is an Ilocano term which connotes that one possesses good traits and blessed with clean mind, heart and soul. The first settlers of Saguday were spearheaded by the adventurous and hardworking Ilocanos composed of the families of Corpuz, Cortez, Cabiles, Guzman and Bacani who hailed from the Province of Pangasinan, the Pagbilao and Olonan family from Ilocos Region, and the families of Cardenas, and Tomas from the Province of Nueva Ecija, who all came to exploit the vast virgin lands and forest of this very promising valley. In August 16, 1959, the founding set of Local Officials to govern the Local Government Unit appointed by then President of the Republic of the Philippines Carlos P. Garcia have assumed office, with then Luis C. Lucas, Sr. as the Municipal Mayor, while the late Nicanor Pagbilao as the Municipal Vice Mayor. Saguday was born as a sixth class municipality composing of seven (7) barrios, however, in the year 1980 and 1981, two (2) additional barangays were created. Barangay Cardenas was created in 1980 pursuant to Sangguniang Bayan Resolution No. 02, series of 1980, while Barangay Gamis was founded in 1981, pursuant to Resolution No. 05, Series of 1981. At present, Saguday is still a 5th Class Municipality due to its limited income which is attributed to scarce resources. Upon the creation of the Municipality of Saguday, the urban core was divided into two barrios : District I now Barangay Magsaysay has been the seat of the Municipal Government from then up to present, and District II now Barangay Rizal. Vision Saguday will be a prime agro-industrial and residential investment destination in the province nurtured by God-loving, informed, empowered, and healthy citizens who live in a competitive and sustainable economy in a peaceful and pro-active community under a transparent, accountable and ethical governance. Mission To promote, uplift and transform the way of life of the people towards a competitive and sustainable economy through a good organizational climate, culture of change, and the delivery of accessible, comprehensive and quality services by means of a transparent, accountable and ethical governance.

It was discovered by Drs. Jan Wolff and Israel Lyon Chaikoff at the University of California, Berkeley: in 1948, they reported that injection of iodine in rats almost completely inhibited organification (thyroglobulin iodination) in the thyroid gland. However, recent research into the study shows that the thyroid hormone levels of the rats were not checked prior to injections. Patients with Graves' disease are more sensitive than euthyroid patients, and iodine has been used to manage Graves' disease. The Wolff‚ÄìChaikoff effect is known as an autoregulatory phenomenon that inhibits organification in the thyroid gland, the formation of thyroid hormones inside the thyroid follicle, and the release of thyroid hormones into the bloodstream. This becomes evident secondary to elevated levels of circulating iodide. The Wolff‚ÄìChaikoff effect is an effective means of rejecting a large quantity of imbibed iodide, and therefore preventing the thyroid from synthesizing large quantities of thyroid hormone. Excess iodide transiently inhibits thyroid iodide organification. In individuals with a normal thyroid, the gland eventually escapes from this inhibitory effect and iodide organification resumes; however, in patients with underlying autoimmune thyroid disease, the suppressive action of high iodide may persist.dennis L.

The Wolff‚ÄìChaikoff effect lasts several days (around 10 days), after which it is followed by an \\"escape phenomenon,\\" which is described by resumption of normal organification of iodine and normal thyroid peroxidase function. \\"Escape phenomenon\\" is believed to occur because of decreased inorganic iodine concentration inside the thyroid follicle below a critical threshold secondary to down-regulation of sodium-iodide symporter (NIS) on the basolateral membrane of the thyroid follicular cell. The Wolff‚ÄìChaikoff effect has been used as a treatment principle against hyperthyroidism (especially thyroid storm) by infusion of a large amount of iodine to suppress the thyroid gland. Iodide was used to treat hyperthyroidism before antithyroid drugs such as propylthiouracil and methimazole were developed. Hyperthyroid subjects given iodide may experience a decrease in basal metabolic rate that is comparable to that seen after thyroidectomy. The Wolff‚ÄìChaikoff effect also explains the hypothyroidism produced in some patients by several iodine-containing drugs, including amiodarone. The Wolff‚ÄìChaikoff effect is also part of the mechanism for the use of potassium iodide in nuclear emergencies.Adelstein SJ (1991). \\"Intervention procedures for radionuclides.\\" Anticarcinogenesis and Radiation Protection 2. Springer US. pp. 227-8. \\"'Cold' iodide is effective in four ways: (a) by diluting the entering iodide pool; (b) by saturating the iodide transport system; (c) by blocking organification of iodide and thus inhibiting thyroid hormone synthesis (the Wolff-Chaikoff effect); and (d) by promoting excretion and thus lowering the total body dose.\\" See also *Jod-Basedow phenomenon *Potassium iodide *Lugol's iodine References Category:Iodine ","title":"Wolff‚ÄìChaikoff effect"},{"id":"2080146","text":"City of Hope may refer to: *City of Hope (film), a 1991 film taking place in fictitious Hudson City, New Jersey *City of Hope National Medical Center, a cancer center in Duarte, California ** City of Hope (charity), the medical center's charity  See also  * Hope (disambiguation)#Places ","title":"City of Hope"},{"id":"2080152","text":"The Jod-Basedow effect (also Jod-Basedow syndrome and Jod-Basedow phenomenon) is hyperthyroidism following administration of iodine or iodide, either as a dietary supplement or as iodinated contrast for medical imaging. Pathophysiology This phenomenon is thus iodine-induced hyperthyroidism, typically presenting in a patient with endemic goiter (due to iodine deficiency), who relocate to an iodine-abundant geographical area. Also, people who have Graves disease, toxic multinodular goiter, or various types of thyroid adenoma are also at risk of Jod-Basedow effect when receiving iodine, because the thyroid will then not respond to the negative feedback from increased thyroid hormones. The source of iodine may be from the diet, administration of the iodinated contrast for medical imaging, or amiodarone (an antiarrhythmic drug). The hyperthyroidism usually develops over 2 to 12 weeks following iodine administration. In some ways the Jod-Basedow phenomenon is the opposite of the Wolff‚ÄìChaikoff effect, which refers to the short period of thyroid-hormone suppression which happens in normal persons and in persons with thyroid disease, when comparatively large quantities of iodine or iodide are ingested. However, (unlike the Wolff-Chaikoff effect), the Jod-Basedow effect does not occur in persons with normal thyroid glands, as thyroid hormone synthesis and release in normal persons is controlled by pituitary TSH secretion (which does not allow hyperthyroidism when extra iodine is ingested). Precautions in medical imaging In iodinated contrast administration for medical imaging, monitoring is indicated in people with thyroid disease, such as toxic multinodular goiter, Graves‚Äô disease, or Hashimoto‚Äôs thyroiditis. Otherwise, for the general population, routine screening with thyroid function tests is generally not feasible. History and nomenclature The Jod-Basedow effect is named for the German word for iodine, \\"Jod\\" (all nouns are capitalized in German, and German cognates of English nouns with an initial letter \\"I\\" preceding a vowel are frequently spelled with initial \\"J\\", pronouned as \\"ee\\", thus \\"Jod\\" = \\"EE-ode\\"), plus the name of Karl Adolph von Basedow, a German physician who first described the effect. The nomenclature \\"Jod-Basedow\\" was carried over intact from the German, rather than being translated, presumably on the erroneous assumption that \\"Jod\\" is a surname. Thus, a more informative nomenclature in English, and one that avoids the appearance of an eponym involving a nonexistent \\"Dr. Jod\\", would be \\"the Basedow iodine effect\\". The Jod-Basedow phenomenon is differentiated from Basedow's disease, which is occasionally used as a synonym for Graves' disease.

Reilly and James Franco in his film debut.  Plot  Josie Geller is an insecure 25-year-old copy editor for the Chicago Sun-Times who has never had a real relationship. One day, her editor-in-chief, Rigfort, assigns her to report undercover at a high school to help parents become more aware of their children's lives. Her first day at South Glen South High School is miserable. Josie reverts to the old geek persona that ruined her first high school career. She also has an unfortunate run-in with three obnoxious popular girls, Kirsten, Gibby and Kristin, and the school's most attractive and popular student, Guy Perkins. Josie loses hope but is reassured when a kind-hearted nerd named Aldys befriends her. Aldys, who loathes Guy and his gang, invites Josie to join The Denominators, a group of intelligent students. Josie develops a crush on her English teacher, Sam Coulson, and becomes the top student in his class. After reciting a romantic excerpt from Shakespeare to Sam, Josie has horrible flashbacks to when she read a romantic poem aloud in class to her high school crush, a popular boy named Billy Prince, who later asked her to their senior prom, making her dream come true. However, on the night of the prom, Billy arrives with another girl and both of them hurl eggs and insults at Josie, humiliating her and breaking her heart. One night while out driving with Aldys, Josie encounters Guy and his gang at a local hangout called \\"The Court\\" where promiscuity and underage drinking take place. Her managing editor Augustus \\"Gus\\" Strauss loses patience with Josie after a rival paper scoops The Court story, and orders Josie to become friends with the popular kids. He arranges for her to wear a hidden camera, and soon the whole office becomes obsessed with her story. Josie confides in her brother Rob about her fears. Rob, who was their high school's most popular boy in his teens, urges her to let go of her old self and start anew. To help her, Rob enrolls as a student and becomes an instant hit. He then uses his influence to draw Josie into the cool crowd, much to the dismay of Aldys. Sam and Josie grow closer, but Sam struggles with his feelings as he thinks she's a student. Guy and Josie attend the prom as Rosalind and Orlando from Shakespeare's As You Like It. Anita, Gus and Josie's other co-workers watch through the camera and are overjoyed as she is voted prom queen. As Guy dances with Aldys as an alleged act of friendship, the mean girls attempt to dump dog food over Aldys. Outraged, Josie throws her crown away and reveals her true identity. She praises Aldys for her kindness and warns the students that one's persona in high school means nothing in the real world. Sam is hurt by her lies and states he wants nothing to do with her. Also angered is Rob, who as a phony student received a second chance at baseball. Josie, ultimately making amends, secures him a coaching job. Josie vows to give Gus a story and writes an account of her experience. In it, she admits she's never been kissed, describes the students of South Glen South, and avows her love for Sam; the entire city is moved by it. She writes she will stand in the middle of the baseball field and wait for Sam to come and kiss her. Josie waits, but the clock runs out with no sign of Sam. On the verge of giving up... cheers, then a booming roar, as Sam emerges to give her a romantic kiss. The movie ends with Sam telling her though it took him a long time to get where he is, he finally is here and then they kiss again.

He descended from a younger branch of the √Årp√°d dynasty. After spending fifteen years in exile, he ascended the throne during an extensive revolt of the pagan Hungarians. He strengthened the position of Christianity in the Kingdom of Hungary and successfully defended its independence against the Holy Roman Empire. His efforts to ensure the succession of his son, Solomon, resulted in the open revolt of his brother, B√©la. B√©la dethroned Andrew by force in 1060. Andrew suffered severe injuries during the fighting and died before his brother was crowned king. Early life =Childhood (c. 1015‚Äì1031)= Medieval sources provide two contradictory reports of the parents of Andrew, and his two brothers, Levente and B√©la. For instance, the Chronicle of Zagreb and Saint Gerard's Life write that their father was Vazul, a grandson of Taksony, Grand Prince of the Hungarians (r. c. 955‚Äìc. 970). The Illuminated Chronicle and other medieval sources write of Vazul's relationship with \\"some girl\\" from the T√°tony clan who bore his sons, who thus \\"were not born of a true marriage-bed\\".The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle: (ch. 60.87), p. 113. According to a concurrent tradition, which has been preserved by most chronicles, the three princes were the sons of Vazul's brother, Ladislas the Bald. Modern historians, who reject the latter report, agree that Andrew and his brothers were the sons of Vazul and his concubine from the T√°tony clan. According to the historian Gyula Krist√≥, Andrew was the second among Vazul's three sons. He writes that Andrew was born around 1015. =In exile (1031‚Äì1046)= According to medieval chronicles, Vazul was blinded during the reign of his cousin, King Stephen I, the first Christian monarch of Hungary (r. 997‚Äì1038). The king ordered Vazul's mutilation after the death, in 1031, of Emeric, his only son surviving infancy. The contemporary Annals of Altaich writes that the king himself ordered the mutilation of one of his kinsmen, who had strong claim to the throne, in an attempt to ensure a peaceful succession to his own sister's son, Peter Orseolo. The same source adds that the king expelled his blinded cousin's three sons from Hungary. According to the contrasting report of the Hungarian chronicles, King Stephen wanted to save the young princes' lives from their enemies in the royal court and \\"counselled them with all speed\\"Simon of K√©za: The Deeds of the Hungarians (ch. 2.44), p. 107. to depart from Hungary. The blinding of Vazul after the death of Emeric, the only son of King Stephen I of Hungary Exiled from Hungary, Andrew and his brothers settled in the court of Duke Old≈ôich of Bohemia (r. 1012‚Äì1033). Here they came across King Mieszko II of Poland (r. 1025‚Äì1031, 1032‚Äì1034) who likewise took refuge in Bohemia after his opponents had expelled him from his kingdom. The Polish monarch regained his crown and returned to Poland in 1032. Andrew, B√©la and Levente, whose \\"condition of life was poor and mean\\"The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle (ch. 53.78), p. 110. in Bohemia, followed Mieszko II who received them \\"kindly and honourably\\" in Poland. After the youngest among them, B√©la, married a daughter of Mieszko II, Andrew and Levente decided to depart from Poland, because they \\"felt that they would be living in Poland under their brother's shadow\\",Simon of K√©za: The Deeds of the Hungarians (ch. 52.), p. 121. according to Simon of K√©za. Hungarian chronicles have preserved a story full of fabulous or anachronistic details of the two brothers' ensuing wanderings. For instance, they narrate that Andrew and Levente were captured by Cumans, but the latter only arrived in Europe in the 1050s. Having faced many hardships, Andrew and Levente established themselves in the court of Yaroslav the Wise, Grand Prince of Kiev (r. 1019‚Äì1054) in the late 1030s. The grand prince gave his daughter, Anastasia in marriage to Andrew. Krist√≥ writes that Andrew, who had up to that time remained pagan, was baptized on this occasion. =Return to Hungary (1046)= Pagans slaughtering priests and the martyrdom of Bishop Gerard of Csan√°d depicted in the Anjou Legendarium In the meantime, King Peter Orseolo, who had succeeded King Stephen in Hungary in 1038, alienated many lords and prelates from himself, especially when he solemnly recognized the suzerainty of the Holy Roman Emperor, Henry III in 1045. According to the Illuminated Chronicle, the discontented lords, \\"seeing the sufferings of their people\\",The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle (ch. 55.81), p. 111. assembled in Csan√°d (Cenad, Romania). They agreed to send envoys to Andrew and Levente to Kiev in order to persuade them to return to Hungary. Fearing \\"some treacherous ambush\\",The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle (ch. 56.82), p. 111. the two brothers only set out after the agents they had sent to Hungary confirmed that the Hungarians were ripe for an uprising against the king. By the time the two brothers decided to return, a revolt had broken out in Hungary. It was dominated by pagans who captured many clergymen and mercilessly slaughtered them. Andrew and Levente met the rebels at Aba√∫jv√°r. The Illuminated Chronicle narrates how the pagans urged the dukes \\"to allow the whole people to live according to the rites of the pagans, to kill the bishops and the clergy, to destroy the churches, to throw off the Christian faith and to worship idols\\". The same source adds that Andrew and Levente gave in to all their demands, \\"for otherwise they would not fight\\" for them against King Peter. The Annals of Altaich states that Andrew \\"savagely raged against the flock of the Holy Church\\". Even so, Bishop Gerard of Csan√°d and four other prelates were ready to join Andrew, but the pagans captured and slaughtered three of them (including Gerard) at Buda. King Peter decided to flee from Hungary and take refugee in Austria. However, Andrew's envoys tricked the king to return before he reached the frontier, and they captured and blinded him. Reign =Coronation (1046‚Äì1047)= Most Hungarian lords and the prelates opposed the restoration of paganism. They preferred the devout Christian Andrew to his pagan brother Levente, even if, at least according to Krist√≥ and Steinh√ºbel, the latter was the eldest among Vazul's three sons. The Hungarian chronicles write that Levente, who died in short time, did not oppose his brother's ascension to the throne. The three bishops who had survived the pagan uprising crowned Andrew in Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r in the last quarter of 1046 or in the spring of 1047. Historian Ferenc Makk writes that Andrew was crowned with a crown that the Byzantine Emperor Constantine IX Monomachos had sent to him. Nine enamelled plaques from this golden crown were unearthed in Nyitraiv√°nka (Ivanka pri Nitre, Slovakia) in the 19th century. Andrew soon broke with his pagan supporters, restored Christianity and declared pagan rites illegal. According to Kosztolnyik, Andrew's epithets (the White or the Catholic) are connected to these events. Illuminated Chronicle) =Wars with the Holy Roman Empire (1047‚Äì1053)= The contemporaneous Hermann of Reichenau narrates that Andrew \\"sent frequent envoys with humble entreaties\\" to Emperor Henry III, proposing \\"an annual tribute and faithful service\\"Herman of Reichenau, Chronicle (year 1047), p. 82. if the emperor recognized his reign. Andrew persuaded his brother, B√©la, to return from Poland to Hungary in 1048. He also granted his brother one third of the kingdom with the title of duke. B√©la's duchy comprised two regions which were centered on Nyitra (Nitra, Slovakia) and Bihar (Biharia, Romania). Skirmishes on the frontier between Hungary and the Holy Roman Empire first occurred in 1050. Emperor Henry invaded Hungary in August 1051, but Andrew and B√©la successfully applied scorched earth tactics against the imperial troops and forced them to withdraw. Legend says that the V√©rtes Hills near Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r were named after the armoursv√©rt in Hungarianwhich were discarded by the retreating German soldiers. Andrew initiated new peace negotiations with the emperor and promised to pay an annual tribute, but his offers were refused. Next summer, the emperor returned to Hungary and laid siege to Pressburg (Bratislava, Slovakia). Zotmund, \\"a most skilful swimmer\\"The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle: (ch. 61.89), p. 114. scuttled the emperor's ships. After Pope Leo IX mediated a peace treaty, the emperor lifted the siege and withdrew from Hungary. Andrew soon refused to fulfill his promises made under duress, and even allied with Conrad I, Duke of Bavaria, a prominent opponent of Emperor Henry III. =Succession crisis and death (1053‚Äì1060)= Andrew's queen, Anastasia, gave birth to a son, named Solomon in 1053. Andrew attempted to make his son's succession secure, even against his brother, B√©la, who had strong claim to succeed Andrew according to the traditional principle of seniority. The scene at Tiszav√°rkony depicted in the Illuminated Chronicle: the paralyzed Andrew forces his brother, B√©la to choose between the crown and the sword The brothers' relationship did not deteriorate immediately after Solomon's birth. In the deed of the foundation of the Tihany Abbey, a Benedictine monastery established in 1055 by Andrew, Duke B√©la was listed among the lords witnessing the act. This charter, although primarily written in Latin, contains the earliest extant textFeheruuaru rea meneh hodu utu rea (\\"on the military road which leads to Feh√©rv√°r\\")written in Hungarian. Andrew also established a lavra for Orthodox hermits in Tihany and an Orthodox monastery near Visegr√°d. The Third Book of Law of King Ladislaus I of Hungary (r. 1077‚Äì1095) refers to an \\"estate survey of the judge Sarkas\\" under \\"King Andrew and Duke B√©la\\".Laws of King Ladislas I (Ladislas III:2), p. 1. According to Gy√∂rgy Gy√∂rffy, the serfs of the royal domains were registered during this survey which took place around 1056. Andrew suffered a stroke which paralyzed him. In an attempt to strengthen his son's claim to the throne, he had the child Solomon crowned in the one-year-long period beginning in the autumn of 1057. For the same purpose, Andrew also arranged the engagement of his son with Juditha daughter of the late Emperor Henry III, and sister of the new German monarch, Henry IV (r. 1056‚Äì1105)in September 1058. Thereafter, according to an episode narrated by most Hungarian chronicles, the king invited Duke B√©la to a meeting at Tiszav√°rkony. At their meeting, Andrew seemingly offered his brother to freely choose between a crown and a sword, which were the symbols of the kingdom and the ducatus, respectively. Duke B√©la, who had previously been informed by his partisans in Andrew's court that he would be murdered on the king's order if he opted for the crown, chose the sword. However, B√©la, who actually had no intention of renouncing his claim to succeed his brother in favor of his nephew, fled to Poland and sought military assistance from Duke Boleslaus II of Poland (r. 1058‚Äì1079). With Duke Boleslaus's support, B√©la returned to Hungary at the head of Polish troops. On the other hand, the Dowager Empress Agneswho governed the Holy Roman Empire in the name of her minor son, Henry IVsent Bavarian, Bohemian and Saxon troops to assist Andrew. The decisive battle was fought in the regions east of the river Tisza. Andrew suffered injuries and lost the battle. He attempted to flee to the Holy Roman Empire, but his brother's partisans routed his retinue at Moson. The Annals of Niederaltaich narrates that wagons and horses trampled him in the battlefield. Deadly wounded in the battlefield, Andrew was seized and taken by his brother's partisans to Zirc where \\"he was treated with neglect\\",The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle: (ch. 66.93), p. 116. according to the Illuminated Chronicle. Andrew died in the royal manor there before his brother was crowned king on 6 December 1060. Andrew was buried in the crypt of the church of the Tihany Abbey. Family The two sons of Andrew by his wife, Anastasia of Kiev, King Solomon of Hungary (r. 1063‚Äì1074) and Duke David Andrew's wife, Anastasia, was the daughter of Grand Duke Yaroslav I the Wise of Kiev by his wife, Ingegerd, who herself was the daughter of King Olof Sk√∂tkonung of Sweden. Andrew married Anastasia, who was born in about 1020, around 1038. Their first child, Adelaide was born around 1040. She became the wife of Vratislaus II of Bohemia, who was initially Duke and, from 1085, King of Bohemia. Andrew and Anastasia's first son, Solomon, was born in 1053, their second son, David, some years later. Neither Solomon nor David fathered sons; the male line of Andrew's family died out with their death by the end of the 11th century.

A federal police force was first established in 1917, and operated under different names and in some periods as multiple organisations. In late 1979, the Commonwealth Police and Australian Capital Territory Police were merged to form the Australian Federal Police (AFP). Commonwealth Police Force (1917‚Äì1919) Initially, after the six British colonies in Australia federated in 1901, there was no police agency to enforce federal (Commonwealth) laws. Instead, the various state police forces were called upon by the Commonwealth as required. During the latter stages of World War I, there was considerable tension within Australian society, particularly over the issue of introducing military conscription. On 29 November 1917, at a public rally over this issue in the rural Queensland township of Warwick, an egg was thrown at Australian Prime Minister Billy Hughes. The offender was charged under Queensland state law, whereas Hughes wanted a Commonwealth charge preferred. The incident, and the perceived lack of action on the part of the Queensland Police, was the last straw for Hughes, who had spent months arguing and fighting with the government of Queensland, led by its anti- conscriptionist Premier T. J. Ryan, over a range of issues. Hughes doubted the loyalty of several prominent Queensland politicians and public servants, and felt that it was necessary to create a Commonwealth Police Force to ensure that Commonwealth law was adhered to in what he regarded as a \\"rogue\\" state. Under the War Precautions Act, 1914, Hughes quickly created a plain-clothed police force, which commenced operations in mid-December 1917. Hughes claimed Australia was at risk from possible revolt or similar action by organisations associated with either Irish nationalism, left wing and anti-war activities, such as Sinn F√©in and the Industrial Workers of the World. At its peak the Commonwealth Police Force numbered about 50 men, almost all of whom were based in Queensland, despite the force notionally being a national one. Commonwealth Police had full police powers for federal offences, but their main task was to report on subversive activities of those opposed to the war and/or the Commonwealth government. Tensions between the Queensland and federal governments flared up a number of times, including during and after a federal police raid on the Queensland Government Printer's Office.  The Investigations Branch and the Commonwealth Police (1919‚Äì1941)  After World War I ended, the Government began to wind the force down. In 1919 it was formally disbanded and the few remaining officers at this time were merged with the remnants of the military's Special Intelligence Bureau to form the Investigation Branch, which was later known as the Commonwealth Investigations Branch (CIB). Like the Commonwealth Police Force, the CIB was administered by the Commonwealth's Attorney-General's Department. CIB had offices located in most of the states' capital cities. The agency, which never had more than about 100 staff, had two roles. The first role was to investigate offences against Commonwealth laws and to better coordinate the investigative capacity of the various Commonwealth Departments. The second role was to conduct special intelligence investigations and mount surveillance on any left-wing groups the Government felt to be subversive of national security. The Commissioner of the Commonwealth Police Force from 1917 to 1919 was William Anderson, a former Inspector in the New South Wales Police. Major H. E. (Harold) Jones replaced Anderson just before the Commonwealth Police was formally disbanded. Jones became the head of the Special Intelligence Bureau and led the Investigation Branch; among the hallmarks of his time in office was a single-minded focus on suppressing left-wing groups of any sort, ranging from trade unions to the nascent Communist Party of Australia. The Federal Capital Territory Police, also known as the Commonwealth Police (and the Australian Capital Territory Police), was also led by Jones from its establishment on 28 September 1927. During World War II the CIB's special intelligence functions were largely handed over to the Commonwealth Security Service (CSS). =Security Service of the Commonwealth Investigation Branch= When Jones retired, in 1943, he is said to have refused to hand over codes given to him by MI5, and sent a secret report on CIB's activities to the head of MI5, Sir David Petrie.H. E. Jones, personal papers, cited by: Val Wake, 2004, No Ribbons or Medals: The Story of 'Hereward', An Australian Counter Espionage Officer In a letter (dated 31 December 1943), Jones told Petrie: \\"The Government having decided that my retirement should take place at the end of the present year, I am sending you a brief review of the work of the Security Section, which I have had the especial (sic) honour of controlling, particularly as your representative, for the past 27 years.\\" Jones' letter and report (headed A brief review of the world of the Security Service of the Commonwealth Investigation Branch) to Petrie, stated, among other things, that: * CIB had been created, at the end of the First World War, to coordinate the records of Australian Army Intelligence and the Deputy Chief Censor (Australia) (a wartime military post answerable to the British Chief Censor rather than Australian civilian censors), and other records relating to war- time activities. *Jones had directed the Special Intelligence Bureau towards the following purposes: ** a Commonwealth instrumentality entirely independent of the States to deal with claims and other matters arising out of the War, and to provide Federal Investigation Services for the investigation of offences against the Commonwealth and; ** to continue under cover of the Investigation Branch the then Special Intelligence Bureau-subsequently General Security. * The Security Service of the branch was concerned with the protection of the \\"Commonwealth [Australia] and the [British] Empire\\". Jones then gave a history of the Security Service which was mostly concerned with watching the activities of dissidents in the community, especially aliens and potential enemy aliens. There were a number of references to the Australian Italian community and Fascistii organisations within these communities. There were also references to Balkan migrants maintaining links with national groups back home and causing trouble in immigration communities, especially those from countries that had been part of the former Ottoman (Turkish) Empire. \\"These elements in the former Turkish areas were always at each others' throats, each group aiming to liberate its sphere of influence from the Turkish yoke,' wrote Jones. * During 1931, Jones continued, \\"the public began to show signs of uneasiness over the growth of Communism and Fascism in Australia.\\" Jones said the most famous of the fascist organizations were the New Guard in New South Wales, the League of National Safety (\\"White Army\\") in Victoria, the Citizens' League of South Australia and the \\"Black Shirts\\" in Western Australia (possibly the Australia First Movement and/or local sympathisers of the British Union of Fascists, the Imperial League of Fascists, or the Italian MVSN). Jones said that the Branch was actively engaged in cutting off funds and arranging the disbandment of these\\" ill- advised bodies.\\" Jones said that the Branch had long monitored the activities of the Nazi Germany in Australia. Late in 1933 the Branch established that a German, Dr Becker, then resident in Tanunda, was in charge of Nazi propaganda in Australia. The Security Section within the branch produced \\"comprehensive\\" reports on the Italian Fascists and German Nazi movements in Australia in 1936 and 1937 respectively. * CIB had also maintained a watch of tourists and businessmen from the Empire of Japan. The Branch reported that the Japanese Consul-General, Wakamatsu, had established a Japanese espionage service in Australia. * The \\"Security Service\\" (the British MI5) had conducted secret work within Jones's organisation, and this had given Jones \\"considerable pleasure\\". Colonel Jones talks about a Security Guard which was formed in 1935 and during the war was being used to guard Commonwealth establishments, especially munitions factories. Colonel Jones said there were some 3,000 members in the uniformed service of the Security Guard. * There was considerable criticism directed at the Branch by \\"certain Army officers\\" and there were unsuccessful attempts to place his operation under the control of the Army. Colonel Jones described Military Intelligence as a \\"society of Friends and Relations\\" and that few of the officers were experienced in security work. * A British intelligence officer, Lieutenant Colonel J.C. (Charles) Mawhood, who had sent from London in 1940 to help with security matters and stay-behind units (to work behind enemy lines in the event of invasion) was, according to Jones, given the run around by the Army. Senior officers claimed that Mawhood was a fraud. Jones writes: \\"Lt. Colonel Mawhood may have given vent to his feelings of disgust when faced with this campaign of intrigue and falsehood. If so, it is not to be wondered at. For such a state of affairs to be possible in any Security organisation is incomprehensible to me, and I can only say, as a loyal supporter and representative of your service for so many years, that I am disgusted with the unfair tactics introduced and the treatment meted out to an officer with your credentials.\\" In a reply to Jones, Petrie concludes by saying: \\"I should like again to express my deep appreciation for the very valuable services which you have rendered and to wish you good fortune and a long and happy retirement.\\" * There had been a misunderstanding between Jones and the Director General of Security (DG), Brigadier Simpson and himself over the use of cyphers. Jones says in his letter that when the CSS was formed the then DG W. J. Mackay (a former NSW police commissioner) had requested that Jones should hand over all cyphers and secret documents. Jones refused to recognise Mackay's authority. Jones referred the matter to the Attorney General, Dr H. V. Evatt, who decided that the codes, the personal codes of Sir David Petrie, should remain in Jones' custody. Jones was given the responsibility of handling all overseas security cables and passing them on to the CSS when appropriate. When Mackay was replaced by Simpson, Simpson repeated the request for the codes. Evatt maintained his earlier ruling. While Jones was away from his office there was a report that Jones had refused to give Simpson decoded messages sent for him by London. The Solicitor General gave instructions to Jones' deputy to release the information to Simpson. * Jones was upset by what he saw a slur on his integrity and hotly denied that he had refused to pass on decoded messages for Simpson. He writes to Petrie: \\"I must, say, however, that after 23 years of continuous service as your correspondent, I felt then, and still feel, that there was an apparent lack of confidence to be inferred from the action taken at your end by communicating on such matters through an irregular channel, particularly in view of my cablegram to you advising you of the official position as defined by Government and not the position as was apparently advised to you without authority. \\" Jones was succeeded as the head of the federal police organisation by Edwin Longfield-Lloyd. =Peace Officer Guard= A Peace Officer Guard (POG) was established in 1925 and by the 1940s consisted of several hundred uniformed officers who primarily provided physical security at critical government locations across the nation. For administrative reasons the head of the Commonwealth Investigation Service (CIS) was automatically Superintending Peace Officer in charge of the POG. Other senior CIS officers also occupied senior POG positions in an ex-officio capacity. Commonwealth Investigation Service (1941‚Äì1960) Following the war's end the CSS and CIB were consolidated into the Commonwealth Investigation Service [CIS]. In 1949, the Australian Government, at the insistence of British and US authorities, established the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) and transferred the counter-espionage and associated roles from the CIS to ASIO. This left the CIS to focus on the more traditional investigation duties. Ray Whitrod, a former Detective Senior Constable in the South Australia Police and early member of ASIO, succeeded Longfield-Lloyd as head of CIS and the Peace Officer Guard in 1953. Commonwealth Police (1960‚Äì1979) By the early 1950s the Commonwealth Investigation Service was run-down and largely ineffective: It had lost a lot of its quality staff to Australian Security Intelligence Organisation; resources were limited; and its role was in reality poorly defined. The Peace Officer Guard was in a similar position. In 1957 the Commonwealth Government acted to address the situation and passed the Commonwealth Police Act. This led, in 1960, to the formal merger of the CIS and the POG into the Commonwealth Police (unofficially known as COMPOL). Over the course of the next two decades the Commonwealth Police expanded its roles and capabibilities. In addition to increasing the numbers of detectives (to investigate crimes such as money laundering, damage to and theft of Commonwealth property), the Commonwealth Police developed forensic, training and administrative services for the Commonwealth and to assist state police agencies. Commonwealth Police assumed responsibilities for policing Norfolk Island and Christmas Island, established intelligence liaison posts overseas, and conducted uniformed policing duties at the nation's main airports. In 1964, Commonwealth Police (including a number of state police sworn in as special COMPOL members) deployed to Cyprus as part of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus. In addition to providing physical security at many key government locations, the Commonwealth Police also took on a greater role in providing close personal protection to senior politicians and diplomats. Ray Whitrod remained Commissioner of the Commonwealth Police until 1969. After Whitrod left in 1969 to head the Royal Papua & New Guinea Constabulary (as it was then known), Commissioner Jack Davis led the Commonwealth Police. In early 1975 the then Labor Government moved to merge the Commonwealth Police with the other federally funded agencies, the Australian Capital Territory Police and Northern Territory Police. The new agency was to be called the Australia Police. Planning was well advanced when the proposal was abandoned in late 1975. Following the 1978 terrorist bombing of the Hilton Hotel in Sydney, a review of Commonwealth law enforcement arrangements strongly urged the creation of a single federal police force. On 29 October 1979, the Commonwealth Police and ACT Police were merged to form the Australian Federal Police (AFP).

He starred in his own Channel 4 television show Sean's Show and was one of the regular team captains on the BBC Two musical panel game Never Mind the Buzzcocks. Early life Hughes was born in Archway, London, but spent most of his youth in Firhouse, Dublin. His mother, who was from Cork met his father, who was from Dublin, on a London bus. His father worked in a telephone exchange and was also a driving instructor. At the age of six, Hughes moved to Dublin and lived with his paternal grandmother. He attended Col√°iste √âanna in Ballyroan. Writing in The Guardian, Bruce Dessau noted of Hughes's early years that: > [He] used to talk about how sounding like a Cockney in an Irish school was > not easy. He later quipped that he spent \\"most of my childhood in a > headlock\\". Not surprisingly his Mary Poppins accent soon developed a lilting > local burr. Making schoolfriends laugh was a classic defence mechanism and > he even set up comedy gigs at his school. What started out as a hobby > quickly became a career.

It is the second most populous municipality in the province and the sixth in the region. Avezzano was documented as an existing urban center in the ninth century. The city was destroyed by the earthquake of 1915. It was rebuilt after the 1944 Allied bombing. The city was decorated with the silver medal for civil merit, an award granted by the Italian Republic.Palmieri, p. 106. It is the main commercial, industrial and agricultural centre of the Marsica area, with important high-tech industries and a large Telespazio satellite farm. History =Toponymy= There are different common etymologies for the name of the city: from \\"Ad Vetianum\\" which means a \\"to the Vetia family\\"; from \\"Avidianum\\" or \\"fundus Avidianus\\" which is derived from the noble Avidius domiciled in the nearby town of Alba Fucens or from \\"Ave Jane\\", an invocation to the Roman god Janus.Febonio, p. 70. =Earliest history= Orsini-Colonna castle View of Avezzano The presence of hunters dates back to the palaeolithic period about 18,000 to 14,000 years ago. There are several sites that bear witness to the presence of humans in prehistoric times, as in the Cave of Ciccio Felice located just south of Avezzano. The first major settlements in this area began with the construction works for the lake's drainage ordered by Emperor Claudius in the first century A.D. =Middle Ages= In 591 in the area came under the control of Ariulf and the duchy of Spoleto. Charlemagne, after the mid-700s, donated Gastald of the Marsi and all the lands of the duchy to the papal states. So originated the county of the Marsi. In the late middle ages the victory of Charles of Anjou led to the destruction of Albe and Pietraquaria whose people had sided in favor of Conradin, duke of Swabia, defeated after the battle of Tagliacozzo in 1268. In the fourteenth century in Avezzano ended the process of aggregation of the various villages that make up the urban center. =Early modern= In the 15th century Avezzano was under Gentile Virginio Orsini, who built the castle in 1490. In the fifteenth century occurred the victory of the Colonna family over Orsini. Their lordship lasted about three centuries. The castle of Avezzano in 1565 was expanded by Marcantonio Colonna and was later converted into a fortified palace. =Late modern and contemporary= Avezzano once lay on the shores of the largest lake in peninsular Italy, Lake Fucino, which was drained in the late 19th century. After the draining of the Lake, wide fields became available for cultivation and the area underwent terrific growth. It was completely destroyed by one of the worst recorded earthquakes in the history of Italy on the early morning of January 13, 1915 with only Palazzi's house and a wing of Orsini-Colonna castle spared. More than 30,000 people died. The town streets were then completely rebuilt along straight, parallel lines, with wide green areas and villas in the Liberty style. During World War I and World War II, a concentration camp was located near the city, where foreign war prisoners were interned. During World War II, Avezzano was liberated by elements of the New Zealand Army (2nd New Zealand Division) on 10 June 1944. Geography Avezzano (top right) and the Fucino plain The city is located north-west of the Fucino. It is dominated in the north by Mount Velino and west by Mount Salviano. Avezzano is considered \\"the city territory\\" of Marsica, Abruzzo sub-region that includes 37 municipalities, for a total of about 134,000 inhabitants. The city is located about 100 kilometers east of Rome,Distance provided by Google Maps: Fastest route 110 km west of Pescara and 55 km south of L'Aquila. =Topography= The urban center of the old city revolves around the Castello Orsini-Colonna (Orsini-Colonna Castle). To the east the territory extends to the villages of San Pelino and Paterno. It is situated between 695 meters s.l.m. in the urban sector and 740 meters in the north, the land of which is a slight uphill slope to the north-northwest. Neighbourhoods (alphabetical order): Barbazzano, Borgo Angizia, Borgo Pineta, Centro citt√†, Cesolino, Chiusa Resta, Cupello, I Frati, La Pulcina, San Rocco, San Nicola, Sant'Andrea, Scalzagallo, Via Napoli. =Climate= Because of its geographical location, situated as it is in the former bed of the Fucino and surrounded by towering hills, Avezzano is characterized by a Mediterranean mountain climate. Based on climatic averages for the period 1951‚Äì2000 published by the agency ARSSA (Regione Abruzzo), and climatic averages related to thirty years of reference 1961‚Äì1990, the average temperature of the coldest month, January stood at +2,0 ¬∞C; that of the hottest month, August, +20.5 ¬∞C. In summer sometimes temperatures exceed 30 ¬∞C. The Climate classification is: Zone E, 2561 GR / G. Main sights Alba Fucens background mount Velino Risorgimento square Tunnels of Claudius The city, having been completely destroyed by the earthquake of 1915, has no monuments of particular interest as do other locations in the region of Abruzzo. However, you can see some important remains of its ancient history. =Orsini-Colonna Castle= The castle was built in 1490 by Gentile Virginio Orsini, who had it built around a pre-existing medieval tower of the twelfth century; it is square, with round towers at the angles. The castle project was probably led by the engineer Francesco di Giorgio Martini. In the sixteenth century the castle was expanded by the order of Marcantonio Colonna, becoming an elegant residence. Severely damaged by the earthquake of 1915, it was partially restored after 1990. =Tunnels of Claudius= The tunnels are located south of the city. They were built by the emperor Claudius between 41 and 52 AD by which the emperor made the first attempts at draining the huge Lake Fucino. To create the tunnels and the main gallery, 25,000 slaves were needed. They dug 32 wells and six tunnels. The lake was largely drained, but with the fall of the Roman Empire the tunnels were obstructed and the lake returned to its previous levels. Many centuries later, Alessandro Torlonia completed the work by finally draining Lake Fucino, building on the original project of the emperor Claudius and turning the land under the great lake into a fertile plain. In 1977, the tunnels were opened as an archaeological park. =Cathedral of San Bartolomeo= The Cathedral of St. Bartholomew was built in 1000 and documented in the thirteenth century. After its destruction as a result of the earthquake of 1915, it was rebuilt after 1940 in the new central square of Avezzano. The facade is neo-Renaissance travertine. The three portals are topped with mosaics depicting Christ and the two protectors of Avezzano, the Virgin Mary and St. Bartholomew. The church inside presents three large naves and a valuable organ placed in the church in 1955. =Sanctuary of the Madonna di Pietraquaria= The original church was destroyed by Charles I of Anjou after the battle of Tagliacozzo in 1268 and rebuilt a few centuries later. In 1915, it did not suffer serious damage and was home to many survivors of the quake. =Alba Fucens= 7 kilometers north of the city is situated the Roman archaeological site of Alba Fucens. It was founded by Rome as a Latin colony between 304 and 303 BC in the territory of the Aequi, on the frontier of the Marsi, in a strategic position. It is on a hill just north of the Tiburtina- Valeria, the ancient road from Rome to the Adriatic regions. Excavations were carried out since 1949 by the University of Leuven in Belgium, led by professor Fernand De Visscher. =Nature reserve of Mount Salviano= The nature reserve, established in 1999, covers 722 hectares west of the town of Avezzano on Mount Salviano. It has a rich variety of plants and different animal species that characterize its fauna and flora. At the center of the reserve is located the Sanctuary of the Madonna of Pietraquaria surrounded by numerous trails frequented by sportsmen and nature lovers. * Fucine Inlet * Torlonia Palace * Torlonia Square * Church of San Giovanni * Liberty Justice Palace Economy =Agriculture= Aerial photo of Avezzano and Fucino plain Photo from mount Salviano Pavilion Torlonia Many farms in the plain of Fucino are distinguished by the quality of the vegetables. Particularly popular is the Fucino potato which obtained the recognition of the quality label \\"Protected Geographical Indication\\". Several qualities of vegetables: carrot highland Fucino (PGI), radishes, salads and all kinds of horticultural products. In Abruzzo, 25% of agricultural GDP comes from Fucino plain. =Industry= Built in the 1970s just outside the city in the direction of Luco dei Marsi, the industrial park includes numerous industrial and manufacturing enterprises and is the economic engine of the province. Among these are Micron Technology and L-Foundry, electronics giants engaged in highly specialized manufacturing. Around 1,600 workers are employed at the fabrication center \\"Innovation & Technology\\" in Avezzano. Also located here are Arab TV, Kidco, the Burgo group, FIAMM, Saes, Presider, Presafer and several other specialized firms. Nearby in the Fucino plain is located the Telespazio satellite farm, one of the major global operators of satellite services. =Commerce= Commerce plays a very important role for the city in retail trade, digital service industries and traditional service industries. Large commercial areas are located on the Tiburtina Valeria street, between Roma street and Cappelle dei Marsi and along XX Settembre street, just outside the city. The so-called \\"natural shopping center\\" consists of the activities in the city center. =Tourism= Near Avezzano there are parks, valleys, cities and the natural environment of the Abruzzi mountains: National Park of Abruzzo, Lazio and Molise, Sirente-Velino Regional Park, Fucino plain, Mount Velino, Ovindoli, Tagliacozzo, Giovenco valley, Roveto valley and Cavaliere plain.

It was originally released on November 28, 1988 in broadcast syndication. Directed by Winrich Kolbe, it was written by Jack B. Sowards. Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet crew of the Federation starship Enterprise-D. In this episode, the Enterprise becomes enveloped by a void in space where the crew is tested by a powerful alien presence. Plot While on a charting mission, the Federation starship Enterprise, under the command of Captain Jean-Luc Picard, discovers a zone of pure blackness in space; probes launched into the area simply disappear. As they study it further, the zone expands and soon envelops the Enterprise, leaving them in a black void with sensors reporting complete nothingness outside. Picard orders the ship on a return course, but they find that they cannot escape; they leave a stationary beacon behind them, only to have it reappear ahead of them again. A Romulan Warbird suddenly decloaks in front of the ship and attacks, and Picard orders the crew to return fire; they destroy the Warbird, but Picard is suspicious of how easily this occurs. The crew then detect what appears to be their sister ship, the USS Yamato, approaching, but it does not respond to hails. Commander Riker and Lt. Worf beam over to search the ship, where they find it empty with various inconsistencies in its construction, including more seemingly impossible physical loops. The Enterprise then detects an exit from the darkness, but cannot lock onto the away team to retrieve them before the opening disappears. The Yamato begins to fade away, but the Enterprise is able to beam Riker and Worf back just in time. More openings appear in the blackness, each closing as soon as the Enterprise approaches them. Picard realizes that they are being manipulated, and orders a full-stop. Suddenly, an entity with a distorted, almost childlike face as a result of it attempting to look humanoid, appears in the void, calling itself Nagilum. It announces its curiosity about humans and their \\"limited existence\\" and would like to test the limits of the human body. It causes Ensign Haskell to experience violent convulsions, and he then falls to the floor dead. Nagilum then states that it wants to know everything about death, asserting that it would take less than half of the Enterprises crew to complete its experiments. Picard decides to activate the ship's self- destruct sequence rather than to submit to Nagilum's whims. As the crew prepares for their end, Picard is tested again by Nagilum through peculiar behavior displayed by doppelgangers of Counselor Troi and Lt. Commander Data, both of whom question the self-destruct order. After these facsimiles are gone and the countdown nears zero, the void suddenly vanishes, leaving the Enterprise in normal space. Picard orders the ship to move away at high speed, and when he is finally satisfied that they are truly free, cancels the self- destruct sequence. As the Enterprise continues on its mission, Picard is met by the face of Nagilum on his ready-room computer. Nagilum offers its evaluation of humanity, criticizing the species's faults and claiming they have nothing in common with its kind. Picard disagrees, pointing out that their recent encounter shows that both species are curious, a logical statement to which Nagilum concedes before disappearing. Notes * The character of Nagilum was originally named \\"Nagillum\\", after actor Richard Mulligan, whom TNG Co-Executive Producer Maurice Hurley originally wanted cast in the role. \\"Nagillum\\" is \\"Mulligan\\" spelled backward. * When Picard is approached by the doppelg√§ngers of Troi and Data, he is listening to one of Erik Satie's compositions, Gymnop√©die No. 1 (1888). * The title of the episode is from the last stanza of a 1907 poem, The Spell of the Yukon by Robert W. Service. * When Picard and Riker decide to set the ship on auto-destruct, the computer asks how long until that should happen (they choose 20 minutes), which is a direct contradiction ‚Äî or development subsequent ‚Äî to a first season episode (\\"11001001\\") when the captain and first officer set the auto- destruct, and Riker comments that they have no choice as to the length of time until the ship destroys itself (5 minutes). Reception In 2018, CBR ranked noted the Nagilum as a strong characterization of Star Trek, in particular it they note how it deceives yet also causes trouble for the crew of the Enterprise 1701-D. The appearance of the USS Yamato was also noted.

It was founded in April 1920 in Heidelberg as a split from the Communist Party of Germany (KPD).La gauche allemande: Textes du KAPD, de L'AAUD, de L'AAUE et de la KAI (1920-1922), La Vecchia Talpa, Invariance, La Vieille Taupe, 1973, p2 Originally the party remained a \\"sympathising member of Communist International.\\" In 1922 the KAPD split into two factions, both of whom kept the name but are referred to as the KAPD Essen Faction and the KAPD Berlin Faction. The KAPD Essen Faction was linked to the Communist Workers International. The Entschiedene Linke decided unanimously to join the KAPD during its congress of 4‚Äì6 June 1927.Die Entstehung der GIK, 1927-1933, accessed 13 July 2010 History The roots of the KAPD lie in the left-wing split from the Social Democratic Party (SPD), calling itself the International Socialists of Germany (ISD). The ISD consisted of elements which were to the left of the Spartacus League of Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht. The Spartacists and the ISD entered the Independent Social Democratic Party (USPD), the centrist split from SPD, in 1915 as an autonomous tendency within the party. The left-wing of the USPD, consisting of Spartacists and ultra-left council communists went on to form the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) in 1918. In 1920, the ultra-lefts of this party, mainly consisting of council communist members whose origins lay in the ISD, split from it to form the KAPD. Founding Conference, 4-5 April, 1920 Berlin The KAPD was formed on 4 April 1920 by members of the left wing of the KPD who had been excluded at the Heidelberg Party Conference of the KPD (20‚Äì23 October 1919) by the central leadership under Paul Levi. Their main goal was an immediate abolition of bourgeois democracy and the constitution of a dictatorship of the proletariat, although they decided against a one-party dictatorship in the Russian model. The KAPD especially rejected the Leninist form of organisation along with democratic centralism, participation in elections, and activism within reformist trade unions, unlike the KPD. The Dutch communist theoreticians Anton Pannekoek and Herman Gorter played an important role within the KAPD; they had, on the model of the KAPD, formed the Communist Workers' Party of the Netherlands (KAPN), which however never attained a similar status to that of the KAPD. The conference was attended by 11 delegates from Berlin with 24 from further afield, who together represented about 38,000 members. The origins of the KAPD's establishment lay in the Kapp Putsch. In the view of KPD's left wing, this event had shown that the behaviour of the KPD party leadership was synonymous with giving up the revolutionary fight, as the KPD's position on the general strike had changed several times, and in the Bielefeld Agreement of 24 March 1920 the KPD had consented to the disarmament of the Ruhr Red Army. The Berlin district group on 3 April 1920 called a congress of the left wing. There it was decided to form the KAPD. The delegates, according to estimates, represented 80,000 KPD members. The newly formed party advocated the ending of parliamentary activities, and the active fight against the bourgeois state. In the coming period it worked closely with the General Workers' Union of Germany (AAUD). The main bastions of the party were in Berlin, Hamburg, Bremen and East Saxony, all places in which a large part of KPD members switched allegiance to the new party. First Ordinary Party Congress, 1-4 August 1920 The Congress was held in the Zum Pr√§laten restaurant, Alexanderplatz The Congress was held in the Zum Pr√§laten restaurant, Berlin. In August 1920, the founding members of the Hamburg branch were expelled, Heinrich Laufenberg and Fritz Wolffheim, who had advocated National Bolshevist ideas. Two months later another founding member, Otto R√ºhle, was expelled. From 1920 to 1921 the KAPD was a coopted member of the Third International. In 1921 the KAPD cooperated again with the KPD during the March Action. This was triggered by Weimar Republic troops marching into the industrial region of Central Germany, and the KAPD and KPD's fear that the military intended to occupy the factories. In 1921 a further fragmentation occurred, when parts of the AAUD around R√ºhle, Franz Pfemfert and Oskar Kanehl broke off from the KAPD and formed the AAUE. After 1921, when the KAPD still had over 43,000 members, the party's influence declined more and more, and it separated in 1922 into the Berlin Tendency and the Essen Tendency around Alexander Schwab, Arthur Goldstein, Bernhard Reichenbach and Karl Schr√∂der. The main reason was the Essen Faction's rejection of participation in workers' struggles in factories, in a situation seen as revolutionary. The Essen Tendency founded the Communist Workers' International, but dissolved in 1927. The Berlin Tendency was the larger and more enduring group, surviving until 1933, when it merged into the Communist Workers' Union.Philippe Bourrinet, The Dutch and German Communist Left (1900-1968) Affiliated unionen right The AAUD, which was formed as factory organisations in opposition to the traditional trade unions, affiliated with the KAPD. The AAUD was formed by the German leftists who considered organising based on trades as being an outmoded form of organisation and instead advocated organising workers based on factories, thus forming the AAUD. The factory organisations in the AAUD consisted the basis for organising workers' councils. A section led by Otto R√ºhle, based in Essen, split from the AAUD, forming the General Workers' Union of Germany ‚Äì Unitary Organization (AAUD-E). Kommunistische Arbeiter Jugend The youth wing of the party was the Kommunistische Arbeiter Jugend (KAJ) or Communist Workers Youth. They published a \\"struggle-organ\\", Rote Jugend, or Red Youth. Relations with the Comintern The delegates of the KAPD to the 2nd World Congress of the Comintern were scorned and their speeches were restricted to a mere ten minutes. This was following the publication of Lenin's Left Wing Communism, which was written as a critique of the left-wing ideas of the KAPD, among other parties, the KAPN and related leftist parties. Theses on the Role of the Communist Party in the Proletarian Revolution,Theses on the Role of the Communist Party in the Proletarian Revolution, adopted by the Second Congress of the Communist International, 1920 adopted by the 2nd World Congress also explicitly criticize KAPD for their position about the role of the Communist Party. Following the exclusionary attitude shown towards them by the Comintern, the KAPD broke with the International in 1921.Bernhard Reichenbach, The KAPD in Retrospect: An Interview with a Member of the Communist Workers Party of Germany Historian E.H. Carr has argued that the 2nd World Congress ‚Äî to some extent unintentionally and unconsciously ‚Äî was the first to \\"establish Russian leadership of Comintern on an impregnable basis.\\"Carr, A History of Soviet Russia, vol. 3, pg. 197. Relations with the (Italian) Communist Left Although German left-communists from KAPD are often understood as same opposition towards the Comintern as Italian Communist Left from then Communist Party of Italy, PCd'I, a tendency also known as Sinistra Comunista, nowadays represented by International Communist Party, between these two lefts were fundamental political divergencies - party role, trade unions, class and party, anti-parliamentarism in principle, - Sinistra held same criticism towards KAPD as the Comintern on 2nd World Congress and these divergencies were not patchedhttp://pcint.org/40_pdf/18_publication- pdf/EN/Tragedy-w.pdf, The Tragedy of the german Proletariat after the First World War up with progressive stalinization of the Comintern.

Early career Van Deman was born in Delaware, Ohio, and graduated from Harvard in 1888. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant of infantry in 1891 after attending law school, and enrolling in medical school. He received his medical degree from the Miami Medical School in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1893. Van Deman then entered the Army as a surgeon, before attending the Infantry and Cavalry School at Fort Leavenworth in early 1895. There he met Arthur L. Wagner who became head of the War Department's Military Information Division in 1896. In June 1897 Van Deman followed Wagner to Washington to work for MID. Military Intelligence Division During the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War Van Deman collected information on the military capabilities of Spain in Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines and had charge of the White House war map. At the end of hostilities he went to Cuba and Puerto Rico to collect cartographic data. He was reassigned to the Philippines in April 1899 as aide to Brigadier-General Robert Patterson Hughes. After two years he was promoted to Captain and was moved to the Bureau of Insurgent Records in Manila, which he helped transform into the Philippine Military Information Division. He organized a counter-intelligence group using locally recruited agents. (See Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War). He returned to the U.S. in late 1902, where he served as aide to the Commanding General, California, and then commanded Company B, 22nd Infantry, based at Fairbault, Minnesota. In 1904 he was one of nine officers selected for the first class of the Army War College (Another was John J. Pershing.) After graduation in 1906, he and Captain Alexander Coxe were sent on a covert mission to China to reconnoiter and map lines of communication around Peking. He returned to Washington in 1907 to become the Chief of the Mapping Section in the Second Division of the new General Staff. (On 26 October 1909 his wife became the first American woman to fly from American soil, being piloted by Wilbur Wright). He returned to the Philippines in 1910. There he resumed his project to map Chinese railways, roads and rivers until Japanese protests led to his expulsion in 1912. Re-formation of MID Back in the United States he taught cartography, then became Inspector-General with the 2nd Division. Now a major, he returned to the War College Division in July 1915. He found that there was a general apathy about intelligence-gathering, and the MID had been downgraded from the second division of the General Staff, and merged with the third division, ending its separate identity. Van Deman wrote a history of MID detailing its beginnings in 1885, its rise in 1903, and fall in subsequent years. He was convinced that the Army must have a coordinated intelligence organization if it were to avoid defeat in the near future, especially as it was now obvious that the U.S. would soon be involved in the war in Europe. Eventually Van Deman was able to get an audience with the Secretary of War to present his case. There he convinced the War Department to accept his idea of an intelligence department for U.S. forces. A crucial role was played by Colonel Claude Dansey of the British Security Service in proposing similar ideas to Colonel Edward M. House, a member of an American liaison mission to Britain and one of President Wilson's advisors. World War I As the result of these efforts the Military Intelligence Section, War College Division, War Department General Staff, was created on 3 May 1917, with Van Deman, now a Colonel, at its head. His friend and colleague Alexander Coxe was the first officer appointed. By the war's end in 1919, it had grown to 282 officers and 1,159 civilians, most of them specialists. One of these was Herbert Yardley, a cipher clerk with the State Department who Van Deman made a first lieutenant and put in charge of codes and ciphers. Van Deman modeled the new organization on British Army intelligence and divided it into several departments: * MI-1 ‚Äì Administration * MI-2 ‚Äì Information * MI-3 ‚Äì Army Section (counterespionage) * MI-4 ‚Äì Foreign Influence (counterespionage within the civilian community) * MI-5 ‚Äì Military Attaches * MI-6 ‚Äì Translation * MI-7 ‚Äì Maps and Photographs * MI-8 ‚Äì Codes and Ciphers * MI-9 ‚Äì Combat Intelligence * MI-10 ‚Äì News (censorship) * MI-11 ‚Äì Travel (passport and port control) * MI-12 ‚Äì Fraud As well as military intelligence gathering, MID was also tasked with preventing sabotage and subversion by enemy agents or German sympathizers on US soil. Short of manpower, Van Deman relied on private groups which he organized into the American Protective League. He also provided security to government offices, defense plants, seaports, and other sensitive installations. He created a field organization in eight US cities which employed mobilized civilian policemen to perform security investigations. In France, MID provided operational intelligence to the American Expeditionary Force, and Van Deman created the Corps of Intelligence Police (forerunner of the Counter Intelligence Corps), recruiting fifty French-speaking Sergeants with police training. Thus, within a few months, he had created an intelligence organization that could support both domestic and tactical intelligence requirements. Post-war activities In 1918 Van Deman went to France to work for Colonel Dennis Nolan, G2 of the AEF, handing over control of the MID to Brigadier-General Marlborough Churchill. After overseeing security at the Paris Peace Commission, he returned to Washington in August 1919 to briefly serve as Deputy Chief of the MID. In March 1920 he returned to the army and commanded the 31st Infantry in the Philippines. He also spent three months on detached service with the British Army in India. He returned to the US and had a series of tours with the National Guard. He worked in the Washington headquarters of the Militia Bureau, then served as an instructor with the 159th Infantry Brigade in Berkeley, California. As a Brigadier-General he commanded the 6th Infantry Brigade at Fort Rosecrans, San Diego, California from 1927. He was promoted to Major-General in May 1929, and commanded the 3rd Infantry Division at Fort Lewis, Washington. He retired in September 1929 after 38 years of service. After retiring he used the contacts he had established during World War I in the American Protective League to privately compile files on suspected subversives and foreign agents. During World War II he acted as a consultant on intelligence matters to the War Department, for which he received a Legion of Merit. Notable among his recommendations was that he sent a passionate defense of Japanese-American citizens to President Roosevelt; the advice that they were not a threat was, however, ignored (leading to the Japanese American internment). Van Deman Street, located within the former Fort Holabird in Baltimore, MD; is named after him in honor of his service in Military Intelligence. In January 1952, at the age of 86, he died in his home in San Diego.

Train at the Mattawa station, 1892. Mattawa House was established by the Northwest Company in 1784. In the 1820s and 1830s, the Hudson's Bay Company (after it had merged with the Northwest Company) sent canoe brigades from their Fort Coulonge Post to the Mattawa River junction in order to trade furs. In 1837, a permanent post was established, but was moved to a new site in the centre of present-day Mattawa in 1843. It was subordinate to Fort T√©miscamingue and Fort Coulonge, but after the arrival of the telegraph in 1871 and the railroad in 1880, it became the headquarters of the Timiskaming District. As the fur trade diminished and the population grew, the post became a general store, trading merchandise to supply lumbermen. It closed in the early 20th century (1908 or 1912, depending on source).Ontario Archaeological and Historic Sites BoardElizabeth Browne Losey, \\"Let Them be Remembered:The Story of the Fur Trade Forts\\", 1999. In the 19th century, Mattawa became a hub for the logging industry, which would harvest large untouched stands of white pine in the area and use the Mattawa River to transport logs to sawmills. In 1881, the railroad was built to Mattawa. It was mostly built by French Canadian labourers. After the railroad's completion, some of these labourers and their families settled in Mattawa (and surrounding areas), bringing with them their culture and heritage.Government of Ontario - Ontario Heritage Trust Logging is still an important industry in this region, and nearby provincial parks and wilderness support the camping/hunting/fishing tourism industry in Mattawa today. Mattawa is located on the Canadian Pacific Railway Chalk River subdivision, connecting Smiths Falls and North Bay, with an additional connection to T√©miscaming, Quebec.

In April 2010, the old Mattawa hospital (visible as the red building in the adjacent image) was demolished amid controversy, since the building was a local landmark for which heritage status was considered. A new Mattawa Hospital had been in service for about a year. The area is also served by the regional hospital in nearby North Bay. The old hospital site is expected to be used for the construction of a new secondary school, funded by the Province of Ontario through the Conseil Scolaire de District Catholique Franco-Nord.

The crosses have been replaced several times. They are accessible via a trail which begins at the Quebec end of the railroad bridge which crosses the river at Mattawa. The view from the three crosses is a spectacular panorama of the town and of the two rivers. Mattawa provides access to numerous dropping off points for canoeing or boating on the Ottawa River. The river acts as a natural border between the hills of the province of Quebec and Ontario. The Mattawa River flows through the Canadian Shield, and wildlife can often be seen and heard. The area offers fishing, camping, and hiking. There are numerous motels, campgrounds, and retreat centres in and around Mattawa. Just west is Samuel de Champlain Provincial Park, on the Mattawa River. The park is also home of the Canadian Ecology Centre, an eco-friendly retreat centre that is facilitated to accommodate business retreats.

The dental lamina is first evidence of tooth development and begins (in humans) at the sixth week in utero or three weeks after the rupture of the buccopharyngeal membrane. It is formed when cells of the oral ectoderm proliferate faster than cells of other areas. Best described as an in-growth of oral ectoderm, the dental lamina is frequently distinguished from the vestibular lamina, which develops concurrently. This dividing tissue is surrounded by and, some would argue, stimulated by ectomesenchymal growth. When it is present, the dental lamina connects the developing tooth bud to the epithelium of the oral cavity. Eventually, the dental lamina disintegrates into small clusters of epithelium and is resorbed. In situations when the clusters are not resorbed, (this remnant of the dental lamina is sometimes known as the glands of Serres) eruption cysts are formed over the developing tooth and delay its eruption into the oral cavity. This invagination of ectodermal tissues is the progenitor to the later ameloblasts and enamel while the ectomesenchyme is responsible for the dental papilla and later odontoblasts. Function Dental lamina plays a key role in a cascade of events that contributes to teeth development. It derived from horseshoe shaped primary epithelial band which is formed when thickened oral epithelium invaginates into the mesenchyme. A series of epithelial outgrowths deep into mesenchyme due to proliferation on the cranial portion of dental lamina give rise to future spot of deciduous teeth. Moreover, further proliferation on the leading edge of the lamina leads to permanent teeth development, as a result, successional lamina is formed when those permanent teeth succeed the 20 deciduous teeth. Since permanent molars do not have deciduous predecessor, they tend to develop from the general lamina which is also formed from dental lamina. In addition, during the bell stage of tooth development, the dental lamina helps to disconnect the interaction between the oral epithelium and developing tooth by bringing the oral epithelium fragments and the tooth germs together. Breaking up of the dental lamina leads to the development of epithelial cells clusters, some of the clusters may remain instead of degenerate, those persisted clusters, called epithelial pearls, they can delay tooth eruption by creating a small cyst on the top of the developing tooth.  Hyperactivity of Dental Lamina  Hyperactivity or over growth of dental lamina can give rise to conditions such as Hyperdontia. Having this condition means patients have supernumerary teeth - additional teeth other than 20 primary teeth in children and 32 permanent teeth in adults. The reasons for this condition could be any of the following: #Dichotomy (division) of tooth buds. #Atavism #Gardner‚Äôs syndrome #Hyperactivity of dental lamina. The most acknowledged theory for supernumerary teeth is hyperactivity of dental lamina. On completion of the dentition, the dental lamina is usually destroyed and reabsorbed, but when remnants fail to resorb, it can continue to proliferate abnormally. This abnormal proliferation can form the extra tooth bud leading to supernumerary teeth. See also *Diphyodont *Polyphyodont References * Gartner, L. The Essentials of Oral Histology and Embryology.

Carrier generation and recombination processes are fundamental to the operation of many optoelectronic semiconductor devices, such as photodiodes, light-emitting diodes and laser diodes. They are also critical to a full analysis of p-n junction devices such as bipolar junction transistors and p-n junction diodes. The electron‚Äìhole pair is the fundamental unit of generation and recombination in inorganic semiconductors, corresponding to an electron transitioning between the valence band and the conduction band where generation of electron is a transition from the valence band to the conduction band and recombination leads to a reverse transition. Overview Electronic band structure of a semiconductor material. Like other solids, semiconductor materials have an electronic band structure determined by the crystal properties of the material. Energy distribution among electrons is described by the Fermi level and the temperature of the electrons. At absolute zero temperature, all of the electrons have energy below the Fermi level; but at non-zero temperatures the energy levels are filled following a Boltzmann distribution. In undoped semiconductors the Fermi level lies in the middle of a forbidden band or band gap between two allowed bands called the valence band and the conduction band. The valence band, immediately below the forbidden band, is normally very nearly completely occupied. The conduction band, above the Fermi level, is normally nearly completely empty. Because the valence band is so nearly full, its electrons are not mobile, and cannot flow as electric current. However, if an electron in the valence band acquires enough energy to reach the conduction band (as a result of interaction with other electrons, holes, photons, or the vibrating crystal lattice itself), it can flow freely among the nearly empty conduction band energy states. Furthermore, it will also leave behind a hole that can flow as current exactly like a physical charged particle. Carrier generation describes processes by which electrons gain energy and move from the valence band to the conduction band, producing two mobile carriers; while recombination describes processes by which a conduction band electron loses energy and re-occupies the energy state of an electron hole in the valence band. These processes must conserve both quantized energy and crystal momentum, and the vibrating lattice plays a large role in conserving momentum as, in collisions, photons can transfer very little momentum in relation to their energy. Relation between generation and recombination The following image shows change in excess carriers being generated (green:electrons and purple:holes) with increasing light intensity (generation rate /cm^3) at the center of an intrinsic semiconductor bar. Electrons have higher diffusion constant than holes leading to fewer excess electrons at the center as compared to holes.Recombination and generation are always happening in semiconductors, both optically and thermally. As predicted by thermodynamics, a material at thermal equilibrium will have generation and recombination rates that are balanced so that the net charge carrier density remains constant. The resulting probability of occupation of energy states in each energy band is given by Fermi‚ÄìDirac statistics. The product of the electron and hole densities (n and p) is a constant (n_o p_o=n_i^2) at equilibrium, maintained by recombination and generation occurring at equal rates. When there is a surplus of carriers (i.e., n p>n_i^2), the rate of recombination becomes greater than the rate of generation, driving the system back towards equilibrium. Likewise, when there is a deficit of carriers (i.e., n p), the generation rate becomes greater than the recombination rate, again driving the system back towards equilibrium. As the electron moves from one energy band to another, the energy and momentum that it has lost or gained must go to or come from the other particles involved in the process (e.g. photons, electron, or the system of vibrating lattice atoms).  Carrier generation  When light interacts with a material, it can either be absorbed (generating a pair of free carriers or an exciton) or it can stimulate a recombination event. The generated photon has similar properties to the one responsible for the event. Absorption is the active process in photodiodes, solar cells and other semiconductor photodetectors, while stimulated emission is the principle of operation in laser diodes. Besides light excitation, carriers in semiconductors can also be generated by an external electric field, for example in light-emitting diodes and transistors. When light with sufficient energy hits a semiconductor, it can excite electrons across the band gap. This generates additional charge carriers, temporarily lowering the electrical resistance of materials. This higher conductivity in the presence of light is known as photoconductivity. This conversion of light into electricity is widely used in photodiodes. Recombination mechanisms Carrier recombination can happen through multiple relaxation channels. The main ones are band-to- band recombination, Shockley‚ÄìRead‚ÄìHall (SRH) trap-assisted recombination, Auger recombination and surface recombination. These decay channels can be separated into radiative and non-radiative. The latter occurs when the excess energy is converted into heat by phonon emission after the mean lifetime \\\\tau_{nr}, whereas in the former at least part of the energy is released by light emission or luminescence after a radiative lifetime \\\\tau_{r}. The carrier lifetime \\\\tau is then obtained from the rate of both type of events according to: > \\\\frac{1}{\\\\tau}=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\tau_{r}}+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\tau_{nr}} From which we can also define the internal quantum efficiency or quantum yield, \\\\eta as: > \\\\eta=\\\\frac{1/\\\\tau_r}{1/\\\\tau_r+1/\\\\tau_{nr}}=\\\\frac{radiative\\\\ > recombination}{total\\\\ recombination}\\\\leq1. Radiative recombination = Band-to-band radiative recombination = Band- to-band recombination is the name for the process of electrons jumping down from the conduction band to the valence band in a radiative manner. During band-to-band recombination, a form of spontaneous emission, the energy absorbed by a material is released in the form of photons. Generally these photons contain the same or less energy than those initially absorbed. This effect is how LEDs create light. Because the photon carries relatively little momentum, radiative recombination is significant only in direct bandgap materials. This process is also known as bimolecular recombination. This type of recombination depends on the density of electrons and holes in the excited state, denoted by n(t) and p(t) respectively. Let us represent the carrier generation rate as G and the radiative recombination as R_r. Then considering the case in which only band-to-band recombination occurs we can express the change in carrier density as a function of time as: > {dn \\\\over dt}= G-R_r =G-B_r np In thermal equilibrium the radiative recombination R_0 is equal to thermal generation rate G_0, with the mass action law n_0p_0=n_i^2, it can be written as: > R_0 = G_0 = B_r n_0 p_0 = B_r n_i^2 where B_r is called the radiative recombination rate, n_i is the intrinsic carrier density, n_0 and p_0 are the equilibrium carrier densities. In the presence of electron hole pairs, the charge neutrality remains \\\\Delta n =\\\\Delta p and the non-equilibrium densities are given by : > n=n_0+ \\\\Delta n, p=p_0+ \\\\Delta p Then the net recombination rate R_r becomes , > R_r = B_rnp-G_0 = B_r( np-n_0p_0)=B_r( np-n_i^2) Solving this equation by considering charge neutrality, the radiative lifetime \\\\tau_r is then given by > \\\\tau_r = \\\\frac{\\\\Delta n}{R_r} = \\\\frac{1}{B_r \\\\left( n_0 + p_0 + \\\\Delta n > \\\\right)} \\\\,. =Stimulated emission= Stimulated emission is a process in which an incident photon interacts with an excited electron causing it to recombine and emit a photon with the same properties of the incident one, in terms of phase, frequency, polarization, and direction of travel. Stimulated emission together with the principle of population inversion are at the heart of operation of lasers and masers. It has been shown by Einstein at the beginning of the twentieth century that if the excited and the ground level are non degenerate then the absorption rate W_{12}and the stimulated emission rate W_{21}are the same. Else if level 1 and level 2 are g_1-fold and g_2-fold degenerate respectively, the new relation is: > g_1W_{12}=g_2W_{21}. Non-radiative recombination Non-radiative recombination is a process in phosphors and semiconductors, whereby charge carriers recombine with releasing phonon instead of photons. Non-radiative recombination in optoelectronics and phosphors is an unwanted process, lowering the light generation efficiency and increasing heat losses. Non-radiative life time is the average time before an electron in the conduction band of a semiconductor recombines with a hole. It is an important parameter in optoelectronics where radiative recombination is required to produce a photon; if the non-radiative life time is shorter than the radiative, a carrier is more likely to recombine non-radiatively. This results in low internal quantum efficiency. = Shockley‚ÄìRead‚ÄìHall (SRH) = In Shockley-Read-Hall recombination (SRH), also called trap-assisted recombination, the electron in transition between bands passes through a new energy state (localized state) created within the band gap by a dopant or a defect in the crystal lattice; such energy states are called traps. Non- radiative recombination occurs primarily at such sites. The energy is exchanged in the form of lattice vibration, a phonon exchanging thermal energy with the material. Since traps can absorb differences in momentum between the carriers, SRH is the dominant recombination process in silicon and other indirect bandgap materials. However, trap-assisted recombination can also dominate in direct bandgap materials under conditions of very low carrier densities (very low level injection) or in materials with high density of traps such as perovskites. The process is named after William Shockley, William Thornton Read and Robert N. Hall, who published it in 1962. Types of traps = Electron traps vs. hole traps = Even though all the recombination events can be described in terms of electron movements, it is common to visualize the different processes in terms of excited electron and the electron holes they leave behind. In this context, if trap levels are close to the conduction band, they can temporarily immobilize excited electrons or in other words, they are electron traps. On the other hand, if their energy lies close to the valence band they become hole traps. =Shallow traps vs. deep traps= The distinction between shallow and deep traps is commonly made depending on how close electron traps are to the conduction band and how close hole traps are to the valence band. If the difference between trap and band is smaller than the thermal energy kBT it is often said that it is a shallow trap. Alternatively, if the difference is larger than the thermal energy, it is called a deep trap. This difference is useful because shallow traps can be emptied more easily and thus are often not as detrimental to the performance of optoelectronic devices. SRH Model  Electron and hole trapping in the Shockley-Read-Hall model In the SRH model, four things can happen involving trap levels: * An electron in the conduction band can be trapped in an intragap state. * An electron can be emitted into the conduction band from a trap level. * An electron hole in the valence band can be captured by a trap. This is analogous to a filled trap releasing an electron into the valence band. * A captured hole can be released into the valence band. Analogous to the capture of an electron from the valence band. When carrier recombination occurs through traps, we can replace the valence density of states by that of the intragap state. The term p(n)is replaced by the density of trapped electrons/holes N_t(1-f_t). > R_{nt}=B_n n N_t (1-f_t) Where N_t is the density of trap states and f_t is the probability of that occupied state. Considering a material containing both types of traps, we can define two trapping coefficients B_n, B_p and two de-trapping coeficients G_n, G_p. In equilibrium, both trapping and de-trapping should be balanced (R_{nt}=G_{n} and R_{pt}=G_{p}). Then, the four rates as a function of f_tbecome: > \\\\begin{array}{l l} R_{nt}=B_nnN_{t}(1-f_t)& G_n=B_n n_t N_t f_t  > R_{pt}=B_p p N_t f_t&G;_p=B_p p_t N_t (1-f_t) \\\\end{array} Where n_t and p_t are the electron and hole densities when the quasi Fermi level matches the trap energy. In steady-state condition, the net trapping rate of electrons should match the net recombination rate for holes, in other words: R_{nt}-G_n =R_{pt}-G_p. This eliminates the occupation probability f_t and leads to the Shockley-Read-Hall expression for the trap-assisted recombination: > R=\\\\frac {np}{\\\\tau_n(p+p_t)+\\\\tau_p(n+n_t)} Where the average lifetime for electrons and holes are defined as: > \\\\tau_n=\\\\frac{1}{B_n N_t},\\\\quad \\\\tau_p=\\\\frac{1}{B_p N_t}. = Auger recombination = In Auger recombination the energy is given to a third carrier which is excited to a higher energy level without moving to another energy band. After the interaction, the third carrier normally loses its excess energy to thermal vibrations. Since this process is a three- particle interaction, it is normally only significant in non-equilibrium conditions when the carrier density is very high. The Auger effect process is not easily produced, because the third particle would have to begin the process in the unstable high-energy state. In thermal equilibrium the Auger recombination R_A and thermal generation rate G_0 equal each other > R_{A0} = G_0 = C_n n_0^2 p_0 + C_p n_0 p_0^2 where C_n,C_p are the Auger capture probabilities. The non-equilibrium Auger recombination rate r_A and resulting net recombination rate U_A under steady- state conditions are > r_A = C_n n^2 p + C_p n p^2 \\\\,, \\\\quad R_A = r_A-G_0 = C_n \\\\left( n^2p-n_0^2 > p_0 \\\\right) + C_p \\\\left( np^2- n_0 p_0^2 \\\\right) \\\\,. The Auger lifetime \\\\tau_A is given by > \\\\tau_A = \\\\frac{\\\\Delta n}{R_A} = \\\\frac{1}{ n^2C_n + 2n_i^2(C_n+C_p) +p^2C_p } > \\\\,. The mechanism causing LED efficiency drop was identified in 2007 as Auger recombination, which met with a mixed reaction.Stevenson, Richard (August 2009) The LED‚Äôs Dark Secret: Solid-state lighting won't supplant the lightbulb until it can overcome the mysterious malady known as droop. IEEE Spectrum In 2013, an experimental study claimed to have identified Auger recombination as the cause of efficiency droop. However, it remains disputed whether the amount of Auger loss found in this study is sufficient to explain the droop. Other frequently quoted evidence against Auger as the main droop causing mechanism is the low-temperature dependence of this mechanism which is opposite to that found for the drop. = Surface recombination = Trap-assisted recombination at the surface of a semiconductor is referred to as surface recombination. This occurs when traps at or near the surface or interface of the semiconductor form due to dangling bonds caused by the sudden discontinuation of the semiconductor crystal. Surface recombination is characterized by surface recombination velocity which depends on the density of surface defects. In applications such as solar cells, surface recombination may be the dominant mechanism of recombination due to the collection and extraction of free carriers at the surface. In some applications of solar cells, a layer of transparent material with a large band gap, also known as a window layer, is used to minimize surface recombination. Passivation techniques are also employed to minimize surface recombination. =Langevin recombination= For free carriers in low-mobility systems, the recombination rate is often described with the Langevin recombination rate.https://blog.disorderedmatter.eu/2008/04/04/recombination-in-low- mobility-semiconductors-langevin-theory/ The model is often used for disordered systems such as organic materials (and is hence relevant for organic solar cells) and other such systems. The Langevin recombination strength is defined as \\\\gamma = \\\\tfrac{q}{\\\\varepsilon}\\\\mu. References Further reading * N.W. Ashcroft and N.D.

He served in the U.S. Congress from 1937 to 1940 as a Republican from New York. Biography Born in Robbins, Tennessee in 1886, Barton was the son of a Congregational clergyman and grew up in various places throughout the U.S., including the metro Chicago area. Barton was raised in Oak Park, Illinois (located ten miles away by railroads from downtown Chicago). Bruce Barton's father, William E. Barton, was a prolific writer and a devout Christian pastor serving the First Congregational Church for over 20 years. Barton's mother, Esther Treat Bushnell, was an elementary school teacher who was descended from a number of colonial Connecticut leaders including Francis Bushnell, Robert Treat, and John Davenport. Barton's siblings were Charles William Barton (b. 1887), Helen (b. 1889), Robert Shawmut Barton (b. 1894).The Man Everybody Knew: Bruce Barton and the Making of Modern America, Richard M. Fried. Ivan H. Dee (Publisher), 2005. Chicago. p.8. Barton's parents also took in a young abandoned mulatto boy to care for in the Barton household by the name of Webster Betty, as they also did for Rebecca, a young African-American girl whose mother asked Barton's parents to take care of her.The Man Everybody Knew: Bruce Barton and the Making of Modern America, Richard M. Fried. Ivan H. Dee (Publisher), 2005. Chicago. p. 8. Journalism appealed to Barton even as a child and he sold newspapers in his free time when he was only nine. Later on during his teenage years, he served as the editor for his high school newspaper, and became a reporter for a local newspaper called the Oak Park Weekly. Barton also helped run his uncle's maple syrup business, which became successful due to his contributions. Barton first enrolled in Berea College (where his father attended college) during 1903 and later transferred to Amherst College in Massachusetts,Dennis Wepman. \\"Barton, Bruce Fairchild\\", American National Biography Online, February 2000. Retrieved November 14, 2013. where he graduated in 1907. =Ad Man= Barton worked as a publicist and magazine editor before co-founding the Barton, Durstine & Osborn (BDO) advertising agency in 1919. Nine years later the agency merged with the George Batten agency to become Batten, Barton, Durstine & Osborn (BBDO). Barton replaced Roy S. Durstein as president of BBDO during 1939 and then headed the BBDO agency until 1961, all while helping his business partners and employees toward establishing Madison Avenue in New York City as the Mecca for the advertising industry, advancing institutional advertising for American corporations, and developing BBDO into one of the major creative advertising firms operating in the United States.The Man Everybody Knew: Bruce Barton and the Making of Modern America, Richard M. Fried. Ivan H. Dee (Publisher), 2005. Chicago. p. 149. Among other famous BBDO campaigns, Barton created the character of Betty Crocker. He is also credited with naming General Motors and General Electric (and creating an early design of the circular GE corporate logo and catch phrase). Barton was also a member of the Peabody Awards Board of Jurors from 1940 to 1942.http://www.peabodyawards.com/stories/story/george-foster-peabody- awards-board-members =Republican politician= Initially supporting progressive political policies as a young man, Barton later became an active supporter of the Republican Party in 1919, and he later served as an advisor for both the Republican Party and several Republican presidential candidates from the time of Calvin Coolidge during the 1920s to that of Dwight Eisenhower during the 1950s. As a staunch opponent of U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal, Barton offered his public relations services to many Republican candidates over the years. Barton won a special election to fill the unexpired term of U.S. Representative Democrat Theodore A. Peyser, who died on August 8, 1937. Barton eventually served two terms (1937‚Äì1941) in the U.S. House of Representatives, representing the Manhattan house district and he later ran an unsuccessful 1940 campaign for election as U.S. Senator from New York. During his time in Congress, Barton was a staunch opponent of Franklin Roosevelt. =Writer= As the author of many bestselling guidebooks, Barton also wrote literally hundreds of popular magazines articles and syndicated newspaper columns, offering his readers advice and inspiration for attaining Barton's own idealization of the American Dream, based largely upon Barton's meshing of his own life as a \\"small town boy\\" and sectarian Christian beliefs in with his admiration of certain American business and industry leaders (\\"Service\\"). The Man Nobody Knows - Christian apologetics for wealthy businessmen Barton had projected many Christian Biblical themes throughout his works completed within his varied writing career, due in part to his own strong religious convictions. One historian writes: \\"Barton believed incurably in material progress, in self-improvement, in individualism, and in the Judeo-Christian ethic, and none of the profound crises through which his generation lived appreciably changed the tenor of his writings or their capacity to reflect what masses of Americans, optimists in the progressive tradition, apparently continued to want to hear.\\" Barton's most famous book was, The Man Nobody Knows (1925), a \\"boosterish melding of religion with business\\" that coupled with \\"new communication and advertising media\\", provided the \\"cultural shift that encouraged the public display of spiritual allegiances that once belonged to the realm of private life\\", while amplifying the widely perceived public adoration of American business during the 1920s.Freethinkers: A History of American Secularism, 2004. pp. 252-254. Susan Jacoby, Metropolitan Books. In this book, Barton envisions Jesus as if he were alive as a man's man in the present day of the 1920s while criticizing the overly meek Jesus that people were used to during that time. Barton also depicts Jesus as a \\"strong magnetic\\" executive businessman, similar to himself. In the 1925 edition of The Man Nobody Knows Barton incorporated controversial chapter titles leading into the exploration of Barton's Jesus- as-businessman themes, such as calling Jesus a modern \\"Executive\\", postulating that Jesus communicated effectively by \\"His Advertisements\\", and hailing Jesus as \\"The Founder of Modern Business\\" among others.The Man Everybody Knew: Bruce Barton and the Making of Modern America, Richard M.

In the much later 1956 edition of The Man Nobody Knows, editors at Bobbs-Merrill \\"heavily amended\\" Barton's text with his permission, cutting out the references to business and advertising. along with excerpts featuring popular celebrities of the 1920s, such as Henry Ford, George Perkins, and Jim Jeffries.\\"The Man Everybody Knew: Bruce Barton and the Making of Modern America\\", Richard M. Fried. Ivan H. Dee (Publisher), 2005. Chicago. p.112. =Role in American history= According to historian Otis Pease, through his careers in advertising, popular writing and Republican activism:Otis Pease, \\"Barton, Bruce\\" in John A. Garraty, ed., Encyclopedia of American Biography (1974) p. 62. : Barton came to embody for a generation of historians and social commentators those middle-class values which (they asserted) had dominated America in the twenties but which the depression exposed as obsolete, shallow if not meretricious, and destructive of liberal ideals....Roosevelt's speechwriters were pleased at how effectively during the 1940 campaign their famous slogan \\"Martin, Barton, and Fish!\\" stamped [Barton] as a political reactionary. Pease disagrees with this hostile portrayal and instead argues that Barton was a leader of the liberal wing of the Republican Party, urging that it broaden its appeal to reach the working man in the average voter. He helped secure the Republican nomination for liberal Wendell Willkie in 1940. His book on Jesus, says Pease, was silly when it said that Jesus was at heart and advertising expert and a sales executive. However, Pease argues, the book was:Pease, \\"Barton, Bruce\\" pp 62-63. :fundamentally critical of the commercial ethos of the day. Its principal thrust was to urge business minded Americans, concerned with success, to model of their lives on a man who, Barton insisted, exemplified humaneness, sociability, service to others, the leadership to inspire ordinary people to rise above themselves, a capacity to love everyone as persons but to tolerate in no one hypocrisy, cruelty, or misuse of power, and the courage to defend one's beliefs and if necessary to die for them that others might be saved. =Sexual affair with BBDO employee= Public attention was called to a sexual affair that Barton was secretly having from 1928 to 1932 with BBDO employee Frances Wagner King. King had originally presented herself to Barton and others at BBDO as an unmarried woman. Her husband later threatened to sue Barton for alienation of affection. Barton paid the Kings $25,000 in hush money. Later, during a 1932 appointment with her attorney, Mrs. King informed Barton that she was suing him for slander and seeking damages of $250,000 based on an unfavorable work reference he had provided to a potential employer of King.The Man Everybody Knew: Bruce Barton and the Making of Modern America, Richard M. Fried. Ivan H. Dee (Publisher), 2005. Chicago. pp. 139-141. Mrs. King also informed Barton she was working on a novel about an advertising man based loosely on Barton's own private and public life, but that she would not publish her work and would drop her slander lawsuit if Barton would settle the matter with a payment of $50,000 to King. The newspapers reported about the Barton and King sexual affair (and other similar King allegations of impropriety by Barton) after learning of Barton's arrest under a civil order from Mrs. King's slander suit. Barton filed a blackmail criminal charge against Mrs. King on April 17, 1933, and her criminal trial ran from July 18 to August 2, 1933. On August 2, 1933, a jury found Frances Wagner King guilty of blackmail. After her serving two years of her original sentence, an appeal court reduced Mrs. King's sentence to three to six years. The attorney handling Mrs. King's slander suit against Barton had paid to typeset King's novel, arranged to have Barton arrested, and offered to rescind the slander lawsuit against Barton upon a settlement paid to King. King's attorney was later disbarred in 1936. =Death= Bruce Barton died at his home at 117 East 55th Street in New York City in 1967.

Created in 2003 by writer Brian K. Vaughan and artist Adrian Alphona, the character debuted in Runaways vol. 1 #1 (July 2003). Like every member of the original Runaways, Nico is the daughter of the super-powered villains calling themselves \\"the Pride\\"; in her case, she is the daughter of dark wizards. Upon finding out, Nico runs away with the rest of the runaways but later discovers that she inherited her parents' magical aptitude. Whenever Nico bleeds, a powerful staff emerges from her chest, called the Staff of One, allowing Nico to bend magic. After the Runaways are betrayed by one of their own in volume one, Nico reluctantly becomes the de facto leader of her unofficial and nameless superhero team, making her one of the few Japanese-American superheroine team leaders. Nico's trademark is her elaborate and ornate Gothic wardrobe. Nico is a sorceress like her parents and great-grandmother before her and can cast nearly any spell imaginable with her staff. Nico uses her talents to make up for her parents' villainous actions and to prevent anyone from assuming the Pride's place at the top of Los Angeles organized crime. In the Marvel Universe, she was featured in Avengers Arena and its sequel, Avengers Undercover, where it follows the survivors of the thirty day-long deathmatch in MurderWorld. Nico is traumatized by those events and temporarily walked away from the Runaways. She later joined Marvel's first all-female Avengers team, A-Force. Nico's Staff of One responds to verbal commands, but can only respond to any given spell once. If she attempts to cast the same spell twice, the results have unforeseen consequences. To summon the Staff itself, Nico must bleed‚Äîas all magic comes with a cost. After working with the Witchbreaker, Nico develops the ability to cast spells without the Staff and upgrades her own abilities. In the wake of her resurrection in Murderworld, Nico jumps up to another power level and even receives a magical arm replacement that can channel supernatural energies more powerful than the Staff. By the relaunch of Runaways volume five, Nico's Staff and powers are reverted to its original condition and her magical arm replaced with a normal arm for reasons unknown yet. Nico Minoru was portrayed by Lyrica Okano in the Hulu television series Runaways which is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Publication history Nico Minoru first appeared in Runaways # 1 (July 2003) and was created by Brian K. Vaughan and Adrian Alphona. In Brian K. Vaughan's original pitch for the series, Nico was called Rachel Messina. Her parents were still magicians, but posed as wealthy antique dealers; this cover story was ultimately used for Gert's time travelling parents. Nico's source of power was not originally going to be her mother's Staff, but Robert Minoru's spellbook. Nico Minoru appeared in Avengers Arena, a new series by Dennis Hopeless and Kev Walker, as well as its sequel, Avengers Undercover. Nico appears as one of the main characters in A-Force, an all-female Avengers spin- off launched by G. Willow Wilson, Marguerite Bennett, and Jorge Molina during Marvel's Secret Wars crossover. Fictional character biography =The Pride= Every year, Nico's parents join five other couples in a charity event; one year, Nico and the other kids spy on their parents. Nico is shocked to discover her father speaking an enchantment, and after witnessing the murder of an innocent girl by their parents (\\"the Pride\\"), Nico joins the others in their massive ransack to run away from their parents. While on the run, Nico encounters her parents. Her mother, wielding a large staff with a ball at the end (\\"the Staff of One\\"), reveals that she and Nico's father are dark wizards; she then attempts to jam the Staff into Nico's chest. Nico's body absorbs it. After she is later cut by Dale Yorkes' Samurai battle-axe, the Staff re-emerges from her chest, which prompts Nico to use the phrase \\"Freeze\\", and freeze Stacey Yorkes. It is revealed that Nico is a witch, and that the Staff only emerges when she bleeds. Sometime after running off, Nico takes on the name Sister Grimm to escape the name her parents gave her, but drops it after a while. After team leader Alex outs himself as the mole and is defeated along with the Pride, Nico is accepted as the group's leader. =Mystic Arcana= Nico as Sister Grimm on the cover of the limited series, Mystic Arcana. Art by Marko Djurdjevic. In 2007, the magic-related crossover event Mystic Arcana fills the gap between Runaways (volume 1) #17 and #18, during Nico's brief time at Father Flanagan's Home for Unwanted Goth Kids. The story begins with Nico dressed in a Japanese school girl's outfit, stating that it's perhaps time to let go of the goth trend. She is soon talked into going to a nightclub with her friends, where she meets her parents' old rival Marie Laveau; Laveau seeks revenge on Nico's parents for stealing the Black Mirror, one of the four Cornerstones of Creation. After Laveau explains that she needs Nico's blood to activate the Black Mirror, Nico gives Leveau her blood, while also purging out the Staff of One. The two fight, and Nico easily wins. Nico attempts to bring back Alex Wilder using the Mirror, however the spell fails, the Mirror shatters and the last page of the Darkhold is revealed behind the glass. Laveau takes it and flees, while Nico accepts her place as an outcast with the Runaways. Artist Dave Sexton revealed Nico was one of the four magic characters chosen for the story arc because each character relates to some elemental themes: Magik represents air and logic, the Black Knight represents the Earth and tools, the Scarlet Witch represents water and emotions while Nico represented fire and wands. As Nico must deliver blood in order to produce her Staff, fire and sacrifice prove to be very similar to Tarot's Minor Arcana suit of \\"wands\\". Although C.B. Cebulski wrote the Sister Grimm portion of Mystic Arcana, Runaways-creator Brian K. Vaughan lent some assistance. =As a fugitive= After being warned of a future threat named Victor Mancha, Nico and the Runaways find and abduct Victor to question him. After Victor's mother is murdered and father, Ultron, is destroyed, Nico invites Victor to become a part of the team, much to the anger of some members, notably Chase. Nico reassures them that she is willing to \\"rip [Victor's] damn heart out\\" if necessary. After Chase ties Nico up before he attempts to sacrifice himself to the Gibborim, Nico interprets it as a cry for help and leads the Runaways to intervene to stop Chase's self-sacrifice. The Gibborim instead attempt to take Nico, revealing that Nico's soul is innocent, thus, suitable for the Gibborim's consumption. Victor rescues Nico and the two form a relationship. After defeating the Gibborim, Victor asks Nico what she's willing to do if Chase does something like this again; Nico responds by saying she is willing to \\"rip [Chase's] damn heart out\\" if necessary. After returning to their lair beneath the La Brea Tar Pits, Xavin realizes she had publicly exposed their location, drawing the attention of Iron Man and S.H.I.E.L.D. Nico, stepping into her role as a leader, leads the Runaways in a cross- country escape from Iron Man and S.H.I.E.L.D. =The Witchbreaker= After escaping the authorities, the Runaways head to New York where Nico anxiously makes a deal with the Kingpin. In a twisted turn of events, the Runaways end up time-displaced in 1907 New York, where Nico is kidnapped and brought to a woman named \\"the Witchbreaker\\". The Witchbreaker claims she is Nico's great- grandmother, and states she will teach Nico how to withstand more pain and, therefore, wield more magic with better proficiency. She wields a weapon similar to the Staff of One, with more adornments. When reunited with her comrades, a significant development to Nico's abilities is evident, where she is freely able to float, displays more proficiency and confidence in casting spells and able to use a spell with an effect more complicated than most of her others thus far. It is revealed that Nico had obtained the Witchbreaker's Staff. Little more information is given to how Nico and her ancestor's meeting had ended, though the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe's more recent edition says that Nico had \\"escaped\\" her. During this period, Victor falls in love with another girl, corrupting his relationship with Nico. =Secret Invasion= During the global shape-shifting alien invasion by the Skrulls, Nico and the other Runaways briefly remain in New York after returning from 1907, trusting that \\"hiding in plain sight\\" would be sufficient to conceal their own identities and that it would be best if they showed Klara around her city in the future before they returned to Los Angeles. However, to their shock, an armada of Skrull ships attack New York and its civilians. Xavin, trying to fool the invaders into thinking she intends to help them, uses a force field to knock out the Runaways; Nico and Victor are still conscious, however, and they attack Xavin, accusing her of being a traitor. Xavin reveals that she is trying to protect them and convinces them that the Skrulls are too dangerous for them to fight and pleading with them to flee to the Leapfrog. The Runaways eventually unite with the Young Avengers to assist against the invading Skrulls. Nico insists on leading her team to help the Young Avengers continue the fight against the Skrulls, refusing to \\"run away.\\" However, Wiccan urges her to leave, claiming that if the Young Avengers lose, they will need the Runaways to save them. =Dead Wrong/Rock Zombies= Nico uses a spell (\\"scatter\\") to scatter a group of invading Majesdanians all over the planet. The spell, however, had unwanted side-effects: it emotionally scatters the Runaways. Victor realizes this in time, and Nico spearheads a massive escape from the returning Majesdanians. A short time later, the Runaways realize that having obeyed Nico, they broke the enchantment. Regardless, Xavin shapeshifts into Karolina and leaves Earth, much to the other Runaways' great grief. Later on, Nico uses the spell \\"Zombie Not\\" to turn an army of zombies back to humans; the spell, backfiring, turns the zombies into an actual \\"zombie knot\\", thus creating a one large zombie. The Runaways deduce that after the Witchbreaker tortured and trained Nico, Nico's magical abilities have been greatly augmented. Val Rhymin's magician informs Nico that the Staff of One carries tremendous magical ability and Nico, being young, should not use it. The magician steals the Staff from her, only to be killed after the Staff defends itself. A silent Nico takes her Staff back, and warns the other Runaways not to touch it. =Dark Reign= At the 2009 Emerald City ComiCon, writer Brian Bendis implied that Nico might be one of the magicians sought by former Sorcerer Supreme Doctor Strange, seeing as the search \\"is not done yet.\\" Although the title went to Brother Voodoo, her image appeared as one of the many candidates the Eye of Agamotto considered to assume the role of the new Sorcerer Supreme.New Avengers #53 Nico also makes a non-speaking cameo in Strange #4 (February 2010) as one of the powerful mages Dr. Strange asks to stop using their powers for an hour.Strange #4 (February 2010) =Avengers Arena= As part of the Marvel NOW! event in the pages of Avengers Arena, Nico is abducted by the villain Arcade and placed on a special island version of Murderworld.Avengers Arena #1 The Staff of One has its power drastically reduced for an unexplained reason, preventing her not only from being able to act out against Arcade or the island, but also requiring \\"dozens of spells\\" just to successfully grow food to eat.Avengers Arena #4 After mounting a frontal attack on Apex and Juston Seyfert's Sentinel, Nico loses the Staff of One when she is dismembered by Chase (now in possession of the Darkhawk armor) and thrown off a cliff. She then crawls to the Staff of One and tries to cast the spell \\"help\\", but bleeds out before the Staff can act.Avengers Arena #10 The Staff then resurrects her, using her massive blood loss as a sacrifice to grant her enough power to disarm Deathlocket, destroy the Darkhawk armor, and defeat Apex by trapping her underground.Avengers Arena #12 Chase returns to his normal self and then helps Nico and Reptil fight a possessed Cullen.Avengers Arena #15 In the ensuing battle, Nara is killed returning Cullen to human form and Anachronism goes wild. Reptil asks Nico and Chase for help breaking up the fight, but Nico insists she and Chase stay out of it. At Nico's command, Chase then turns into Darkhawk and sucker-punches Reptil as part of some secret plan that he and Nico devised. Chase showed regret at having to attack Reptil.Avengers Arena #16 When Chase refused to let Cammi stop Nico, she broke his arm and leg, taking the Darkhawk amulet for herself in order to stop Nico from killing everyone.Avengers Arena #17 Cammi gives Chase the amulet again when Apex unleashes bugs, sentient typhoon, and weaponized sand to attack the remaining teens on Murderworld.Avengers Arena #18 Soon after, Deathlocket stops the fight by killing Apex, and everyone is able to escape Murderworld and disperse. =Avengers Undercover= Once news broke about Arcade's kidnappings, Nico and the other Murder World Survivors became infamous. Nico has dyed her hair slightly red and still sports the witch arm she gained in the fight with Apex.Avengers Undercover #1 She also has the power to teleport and create floating and cloaking spells. To the other Runaways' horror, she and Chase fight during one of Chase's interviews on the talk show, criticizing Chase for breaking their pact of silence, which was made moot when Arcade released video. She then teleported Chase away from the set. However, when Anachronism reveals Bloodstone's gone missing, all the survivors team up to head to Bagalia to find him. On their way in, Nico berates Chase for saying they're \\"family,\\" pointing out that he only came with them because she made him. Once they find Bloodstone, he reveals that he enjoys life among the villains, and the others, minus Cammi, start to enjoy it as well. Nico tries to convince Bloodstone to come back with them, but he refuses. Daimon Hellstrom has been helping Cullen control his monster and he offers to help Nico with her upgraded powers too. When Cammi tries to tell the others to leave, Bloodstone instead has Hellstrom teleport the group to Arcade's latest party so they can confront him.Avengers Undercover #2 Hazmat uses this opportunity to kill Arcade. Baron Zemo then tell them they have two choices, join him or be returned to the surface to be punished by S.H.I.E.L.D.. Nico comes up with a third option, pretend to join Zemo and destroy his organization from the inside. She works closely with Hellstrom to strengthen her magical powers. Eventually they unwittingly feed to Avengers information planted by Zemo in order to trap the Avengers in Bagalia and then steal S.H.I.E.L.D.'s helicarrier. Cammi stops Zemo and reveals Arcade is alive. Since only a body double was killed, S.H.I.E.L.D. drops any charges against the teens. She is last seen enjoying some vacation time on a lake with the rest of the group in the final issue of the series.Avengers Undercover #10 =A-Force= During the \\"Secret Wars\\" storyline, A-Force, the defenders of the matriarchal Battleworld nation of Arcadia, responds to a megalodon attack while on routine patrol. During the attack, America Chavez throws the shark across the Shield, the wall that separates their borders, thus breaking the laws of Emperor Doom and is subsequently arrested by Doom's enforcers, the Thor Corps. Despite appeals from She-Hulk, the baroness of Arcadia, Chavez is sentenced to spend the rest of her life on the wall. In response, She-Hulk tasks the Sub-Mariners - Namor, Namorita, and Namora - to find the source of the megalodon attack. Meanwhile, Nico, lamenting the loss of Chavez, comes across a mysterious figure that fell out of the sky. The Sub-Mariners discover a strange portal in the ocean's depths but it implodes as they draw near. Later, at the behest of Loki, Minoru introduces her new friend to She-Hulk. When Medusa accuses the stranger, a sentient pocket universe, of creating the portal, a sentinel falls from another portal and attacks the team. During the fight, the newcomer saves Dazzler and convinces She-Hulk that she is not the cause. After destroying the sentinel, She-Hulk decides to travel through the still open portal and investigate the source herself. She-Hulk arrives in a post-apocalyptic Manhattan and after a brief encounter with more sentinels, she is chased back to Arcadia by the Thor Corps. The Thor Corps follow in pursuit, but Medusa manages to repel them back into the portal and is killed in the process. When the Thor Corps return, She-Hulk alerts the citizens of Arcadia that there is a traitor in their midst that is spreading discontent and vows to bring them to justice as she and other A-Forcers go into hiding inside the newcomer. The newcomer smuggles A-Force outside the city. There, She-Hulk realizes that the portals' energy is of Asgardian origin and they deduce that the traitor is Loki. With A-Force outlawed, Loki is set to be crowned the new baroness of Arcadia but is preemptively attacked by A-Force. After Loki is defeated, she releases a final blast of energy that breaches the Shield thus allowing the zombie horde on the other side to enter. As the horde approaches, She-Hulk rallies A-Force, the Thor Corps and other heroes in defense of Arcadia. During the fight, the zombies begin to overwhelm the city but the newcomer ‚Äì now named Singularity ‚Äì absorbs the entire horde, sacrificing herself in the process. In the aftermath of the battle, the Thor Corps arrests Loki as A-Force begins reconstruction of Arcadia. Meanwhile, She-Hulk comforts Minoru, who is still mourning the loss of her friends, telling her that she believes Singularity lives on.A-Force Vol. 1 #1-5 Following the Secret Wars storyline, Singularity awakes in the primary Earth-616 universe and quickly spots Carol Danvers but Danvers does not recognize her. Unbeknownst to Singularity, she is being pursued by a similar being named Antimatter. While Danvers confronts Antimatter, Singularity flees to New York City. With Antimatter still in pursuit, Singularity locates She- Hulk, who does not remember her either, and asks for help. As the pair fight Antimatter, Medusa arrives with reinforcements and takes Singularity into custody. After Antimatter kills one of Medusa's soldiers, she releases Singularity and teleports Antimatter to the moon. Realizing that physical attacks are having little effect on Antimatter, Singularity transports She- Hulk, Medusa and herself to Japan to seek the help of Minoru. When Antimatter returns, Minoru casts a spell that causes him to be temporarily unmade. The spell buys the women some time during which Danvers suggests that Antimatter maybe susceptible to intense levels of light particles. They then travel to Miami to recruit Dazzler just as Antimatter remerges. Dazzler hits Antimatter with everything she has to no avail but it gives Danvers time to activate a containment device that she designed. When Antimatter overloads the device, Singularity has Minoru remove Antimatter's tracking ability and transports the team to The Peak. As Antimatter eventually reaches The Peak, She-Hulk orders Singularity to stay behind while the rest of the team leaves to parley with Antimatter. After talks fail, Antimatter fatally wounds Dazzler and in turn She-Hulk decapitates Antimatter. Angered by Dazzler's death, Singularity leaves to confront a recovered Antimatter one-on-one. As Singularity fights Antimatter, Dr. Tempest Bell, The Peak's lead scientist, develops a bomb capable of destroying Antimatter but denoting it will also kill Singularity. She-Hulk, Minoru and Danvers go to reinforce Singularity, while Medusa places the bomb inside Antimatter. Just as the bomb explodes, a revived Dazzler arrives with a dimensional teleporter and whisks Singularity away from the blast. With Antimatter destroyed, the team celebrates at a diner when Singularity senses a disturbance as remnants of Antimatter tear open portals to other worlds. In Astoria, Oregon, A-Force tracks a dragon from Battleworld named Countess and discover that she is being pursued by an alternate version of Dazzler that belonged to the Thor Corps. A-Force joins Dazzler Thor in combat which causes Countess to retreat. As the heroes wait for Countess's return, Dazzler confides to Dazzler Thor that she has been infected by the Terrigen Mist and is dying. When Countess arrives, she takes control of Minoru who then incapacitates the team. She-Hulk, Medusa, Dazzler, Dazzler Thor, and Danvers awake in a jail cell in Astoria to discover that their powers are gone and the populace under the control of the Countess. After She-Hulk taunts the Countess, she has Minoru turn She-Hulk against the others. As the fight with She-Hulk takes the team away from the city and their powers return, the Countess has Minoru turn their feet into cement shoes and drag them under water. As the team is about to drown, Minoru commands them to breathe. Once out of the water, She-Hulk sends half the team to distract Countess, while the others rescue Minoru. After being rescued, Minoru reveals the true nature of Countess' powers and returns with Dazzler and Dazzler Thor to confront Countess. Minoru convinces Countess to have a change of heart as Dazzler Thor succumbs to the compounded effects that the Terrigen Mist are having on her otherworldly system. After Dazzler Thor's body vanishes, Dazzler warns her teammates that she may suffer a similar fate.A-Force Vol. 2 #1-7 During the \\"Civil War II\\" storyline, after She-Hulk is gravely wounded in a battle with Thanos, Danvers tells Minoru that the Inhuman Ulysses had a vision of her killing a woman named Alice. Refusing to be arrested for a crime that she has yet to commit, Minoru flees to a safehouse in Ouray, Colorado. Unbeknownst to Minoru, the town is under attack from a swarm of giant bugs. Minoru encounters Elsa Bloodstone. Bloodstone informs Minoru that the attack is the result of an infection that is turning the populace into insects and takes her to meet Janine, whose daughter Alice has gone missing during the commotion. Meanwhile, Danvers and Medusa race to find Minoru before Dazzler and Singularity, who disagree with their methods. Danvers and Medusa find Minoru and Bloodstone just before Dazzler and Singularity arrive. After a brief confrontation, they agree to split into two teams: one to find Alice and the other to protect the civilians. While searching for Alice in an abandoned mine, Danvers, Minoru and Bloodstone are attacked by a giant bug. The bug incapacitates Danvers and Bloodstone before telepathically communicating to Minoru that she is Alice and has been inadvertently infecting the townspeople after her transformation. Alice tells Minoru that killing her is the only way to save the people. When Minoru refuses, an infected Bloodstone threatens to kill Danvers. Medusa, Singularity, and an infected Dazzler are overrun by bugs and regroup with the others just as Bloodstone infects Danvers. After Dazzler infects Medusa, Minoru casts a spell to transform Alice back into a human but it does not cure the rest of the populace. Alice explains that she must be killed and Minoru reluctantly casts a death spell on Alice which transforms the infected back into humans. Alice then remerges in her final form and tells A-Force that she is no longer a threat as she now has greater control of her powers. When the commotion is over, Danvers and Minoru continue to disagree over each other's actions but agree to visit She-Hulk together in the hospital.A-Force Vol. 2 #8-10 Powers and abilities The original Staff of One.Runaways: Volume 1, #5 =Spellcasting= Nico, being a witch, uses magic as her weapon. In the early issues, her sole weapon had been the Staff of One, an ancient magical staff that can cast any spell imaginable.Runaways: Volume 1, #7 The Staff, however, comes with two limitations; first, and more importantly, Nico cannot cast the same spell twice, or the spell will misfire and a random effect will occur; for example, the second time she tried to cast \\"Freeze,\\" she produced pelicans, and the second time she attempted to cast a \\"Fumigation\\" spell, the staff teleported Nico and Karolina miles in the Los Angeles desert.Runaways: Volume 2, #7 The second limitation of the Staff of One is that it cannot be used to bring people back from the dead.Runaways: Volume 2, #2 Nico discovered this limitation when she tried to resurrect Alex Wilder, and explained why she could not magically revive the deceased future version of Gertrude Yorkes. Tina Minoru, the Staff's owner previous to Nico, mentions that the Staff even made Dormammu (a demonic entity with vast magical power far surpassing even that of the Sorcerer Supreme) trembleRunaways: Volume 7, #1 and that it gave the wielder \\"[a]ll the power of the past, present and future\\" and would make its wielder \\"unstoppable.\\" Tina is also able to do spells without saying them, as evident when she turns herself, Robert Minoru, and the Steins into their villain costumes.Runaways: Volume 1, #3 In Civil War: Young Avengers/Runaways, Nico successfully cast a tunneling spell using a Latin phrase supplied to her by the Vision, even without knowing its meaning.Civil War: Young Avengers/Runaways Only Nico can summon the Staff, but initially, anyone could cast spells with it. When not in use the Staff retreats into her body, which Nico describes as \\"feel[ing] like I have something in my eye, but instead of my eye, it's...it's my soul.\\" To summon the Staff, Nico sheds blood and automatically recites \\"When blood is shed, let the Staff of One emerge.\\" Early in volume one, Nico would cut herself to release the Staff, often using Chase's switchblade.Runaways: Volume 1, #8 As the series progressed, Nico found alternative ways to make herself bleed, including brushing her gums for extended periods of timeRunaways: Volume 2, #16 and having Gert's Deinonychus Old Lace bite her arm;Runaways: Volume 1, #14 during her monthly menstrual cycle, Nico does not need to cut herself to evoke the Staff.Runaways: Volume 2, #1 The Staff always emerges from the center of her chest, and passes through any clothing she is wearing without damaging it or Nico. However the Staff will damage anyone or anything directly in its way when ejected from Nico's body. For example, the Staff emerged after the vampire Topher began to drain Nico's blood and pierced directly through the center of his chest. Nico cannot truly control what kind of effect her spells will have: she must conjure up painful memories to cast a spell, as well as imagining anything that makes her feel guilty.Runaways: Volume 2, #12 In the Mystic Arcana series, Nico is said to have far greater magical potential than even she had realized, as the last living heir to the Clan Minoru; Nico overwhelms Marie LaVeau in a matter of moments, despite all of Marie's magical experience and power, and discovers that the roots of her family legacy are deeper than even she imagined, with her being the only person alive capable of unlocking the Black Mirror. Nico is told that she has stepped onto the Dark Path and that she and Marie shall meet again, \\"for all those who step onto the Dark Path are destined to travel that road together.\\" On occasion, however, she has cast spells without resorting to the Staff, such as creating an image of Alex Wilder in the palm of her hand. Time and space are also crucial limitations to the power of the Staff: all spells shown cast by it only have a temporary effect, and the effects of these spells weaken as the distance between Nico and the target increases. In Runaways vol. 2 #17, it is revealed that if Nico steps into the path of the ashes of dead wizards, her powers will not work at all. =Extended magic= Nico's time with the Witchbreaker has granted her a newer version of the Staff of One, similar to the original but with more adornments and a larger ring (the ball on the original Staff is also removed). Nico can now wield its powers and cast spells with greater proficiency than before, even floating under her own powers instead of using the Staff, as Nico had already cast a variety of levitation enchantments before. Furthermore, Victor Mancha also questions how Nico is floating, apparently indicating that this was indeed not of the Staff's own magic.Runaways: Volume 2, #30 Nico can now cast a variety of spells without using her Staff, bringing her closer to her parents' abilities. It is unknown where the Staff of One is now, though her new staff, regardless of its precise origins, is summoned in exactly the same method as the former.Runaways: Volume 3, #1 More recently, Nico's Staff has displayed an ability to defend itself. The Staff now reacts violently toward anyone other than Nico who attempts to use it, turning into a demon or dragon and devouring that individual.Runaways: Volume 3, #9 Later in Daken: Dark Wolverine she shows that her spells can be extremely detailed when she freezes Daken with \\"Freeze to the exact temperature and aesthetic appearance of a cheap Popsicle from a 7/11\\" though she still has the \\"One spell\\" rule. After her murder by Apex and subsequent resurrection, Nico once again received a new Staff of One with a new design up top. This staff also was shorter and did not extend to the ground, could be touched by anyone (as Apex proved), and could be summoned back to Nico upon command. Nico was also granted a new left arm where she could perform spells without holding the Staff of One. According to the resurrected Alex, the left arm was clearly a more powerful conduit of dark magic than even the Staff of One. This upgrade increased her dark powers and allowed her to enter a blind rage where her magic is more powerful, as she runs purely on instinct.Avengers Undercover #7 =Character attributes and personality= Nico summons the Staff of One for the first time. Nico is Japanese American.Runaways: Volume 2, #28 She is also shown to be a very emotional person. She expresses feelings for Alex Wilder during their original getaway, but is hesitant to start a romance.Runaways: Volume 1, #6 After Alex saves her from a vampire attack, sometime later she begins to date him. This pattern of seeking physical or romantic comfort with people during stressful or intense situations follows Nico throughout the remainder of the series.Runaways: Volume 2, #19 Despite this, Nico proves her loyalty to the Runaways when Alex betrays the group and offers her a seat in the new world promised by Pride's Biblical benefactors, the Gibborim.Runaways: Volume 1, #17 She refuses Alex's offer brutally and helps usher her friends to safety. Nico is sent to Father Flanagan's Home for Unwanted Goth Kids. However, the group organizes a mass escape from their homes to begin life as full-time vigilantes; Nico is generally accepted as the team leader.Runaways: Volume 1, #18 When Nico takes the leadership position, it proves she has the intelligence and courage to make difficult decisions. One notable example is a risky decision in leaving Xavin to battle a resurrected Geoffrey Wilder herself saying \\"Xavin knew the risks\\". In another incident where the Punisher was holding them at gunpoint and was seriously injured by being punched in the stomach by Molly, when the others expressed concern about his condition, Nico flatly stated that she \\"wasn't going to waste a healing spell\\" on him. Nico also kisses Chase after he negotiates their way out of a potentially fatal situation with an interdimensional drug-dealer; this causes a falling out between Nico and Chase's girlfriend Gert, almost dissolving the team from the inside.Runaways: Volume 2, #17 Gert's untimely death sends Nico into the arms of Victor Mancha, with whom she reveals she has a habit of running to people when distressed. She suffered survivor's guilt regarding Gert's death. Her insecurities and confusion over her romantic life comes to haunt her in a dream, where her deceased parents berated Nico for acting like a \\"slut\\" (for kissing Alex, Topher, Chase and Victor).Runaways: Volume 2, #23 Nico admits she is confused but she will figure \\"who and what (she) likes on her own\\" and then she kills them. She begins a relationship with Victor, but the relationship is quickly ended mutually after Victor falls for another girl. Nico became very isolated and unstable after the events of Avengers Arena, where she was dismembered, resurrected, and ultimately survived MurderWorld, having almost no contact with the Runaways, even ignoring Molly's birthday. She explains she was destroyed after the events of the Arena, she was terrified of her new powers and was likely suffering from severe PTSD, and seeing Chase return to normal after the experience only made her hurt more. Relationships with other Runaways Nico is a very emotional person and has repeatedly expressed difficulty with knowing precisely what she is feeling. Nico admits to Victor that she has a tendency to seek comfort after highly emotional situations or periods of stress. Despite this, she is typically very open when trying to express her feelings and has thus been able to connect with many of the Runaways on an emotional level and maintain many close friendships throughout the series. Over the years, Minoru has romantic relationships with several people, including Alex Wilder - by whose treachery she is devastated - and Victor Mancha. She has a confusing and frustrating time with the mutual feelings between her and Karolina, however, a romantic relationship never developed as their timing never seemed to work out. Nico did eventually realize that she truly did love Karolina and after asking for a second chance, started a relationship with her. =Alex Wilder= In the first volume, Nico and Alex share a brief relationship. She kisses him for the first time during the Runaways' attempted rescue of Molly Hayes; it is later revealed Alex was Nico's first kiss.Runaways: Volume 2, #22 She kisses and expresses love for Alex after he saves her from the vampire Topher; it is generally accepted that Nico and Alex are a couple at this point.Runaways: Volume 1, #10 Despite her professed love for Alex, Nico chooses to side with the Runaways after Alex reveals his plan to bring her to the Gibborim's new world with her parents, firmly establishing her dedication to the team and her strength of character. However, despite the betrayal, Nico demonstrates willingness to forgive when she unsuccessfully tries to resurrect Alex, and states that even though Alex was a traitor, he did not deserve death. In Mystic Arena set in volume one, she still misses and loves him. During the events of Avengers Undercover, Alex is resurrected by Daimon Hellstrom to become Nico's tutor in battle strategy. She reminiscences her past affection for him; however, it's now replaced with murder daydreams of him and annoyance of his attempts to flirt with her. She tells him \\"what we used to be, that's dead\\". After Chase was injured in battle and left comatose, she is devastated and blamed herself. Nico momentarily gave up being good as it kept turning out wrong and hurt people she loves. She decided to 'do the wrong thing' in order to feel good, and briefly rekindled her romance with Alex before he betrayed her.Avengers Undercover‚Äù #8 And once again, they went their separate ways as she fought alongside the superheroes whereas Alex joined the super-villainous team, Young Masters.Avengers Undercover‚Äù #9 =Karolina Dean= Karolina's feelings for Nico were hinted at throughout volume 1, ending with Karolina sheepishly blushing when Nico says she has sworn off boys. However, Karolina's feelings were not explicitly expressed until she attempted to kiss Nico. Nico immediately turned Karolina down; however, when Karolina decides to travel to her home planet Majesdane with Xavin, Nico is distraught for losing her friend. The Runaways stop Nico from casting a spell to bring Karolina back to Earth. Months later, Chase catches Nico strewing Karolina's clothes about her floor for remembrance's sake and tells him, \\"I didn't hurt this bad when Alex betrayed us. I didn't even hurt like this when our parents died\\". After Karolina returns, Nico becomes overjoyed and hugs her, saying that she felt all alone with Karolina gone. Their friendship is an occasionally strained one, due to Karolina's unrequited feelings towards Nico and Nico's conflicted feelings towards Karolina's relationships.Runaways: Volume 2, #25 When the group re-bands some time later, Nico attempted to kiss Karolina, revealing her possible romantic feelings. However, Karolina rejected her, due to her wanting to be faithful to her girlfriend, Julie Power, and dismissed it as Nico's habit of seeking physical comfort in times of stress.Runaways: Volume 5, #5 Following Julie and Karolina's break-up, Karolina invited Nico to attend her parents' legitimate foundation's charity ball with her. While there, Karolina's usual nervousness was replaced by newfound confidence because of Nico's support as she is \\"always seen the real\\" her.Runaways: Volume 5, #12 Nico confessed for a long time she was confused about herself so she couldn't see her clearly. Nico knows who and what she wants now and asks Karolina to give her a second chance. Karolina was surprised and a little scared but the two kissed, beginning a relationship. =Chase Stein= Nico admits she provides a motherly role to Chase's rule-breaking persona.Runaways: Volume 2, #9 The pair maintain a strong respect for each other despite often disagreeing over major group decisions, including Gert's burial site and allowing Victor to join the team.Runaways: Volume 2, #6 Chase cares for Nico's safety and well-being, as evidenced from when he comforted Nico after Karolina's departure, and when he took the Staff of One from Nico to destroy it to give her a normal life.Runaways: Volume 2, #24 After Chase bluffed their way out of a fatal encounter with the drug lord, Pusher-Man, Nico kisses him. This causes a rift in their friendship, and into Gert and Chase's relationship.Runaways: Volume 2, #11 Nico is also the only person that Chase bids farewell before leaving to sacrifice himself for the Gibborim, which Nico interprets as a cry for help. Following their adventure in 1907, Chase and Nico's friendship appeared to be more stable after Chase moved past grieving for Gert. In Volume 3, issue 13, the two share a surprising and intimate kiss. Later, both were kidnapped together by Arcade to participate in his latest incarnation of Murderworld. In there, Nico started to develop a love-hate relationship with Chase. She repeatedly chided Chase for acting out of character and risking their lives. During the events of the arena, Nico was angry at Chase for acting differently or untrustworthy, even kicking him out of the group at one point. Despite this, Chase planned on protecting Nico and making sure she and not himself, was going to survive Murder World. After the events of the Arena, Nico became reclusive while Chase became the sole guardian of the Runaways. Nico was angry that Chase had reverted to his old-self after Murder World, while she thought of herself as broken. She was devastated when Chase was left comatose after a battle. =Gertrude Yorkes= Gert and Nico had been close friends since birth. After Gert's death, Nico tells Victor (while crying) that Gert had sent her My Little Pony dolls in the forest because Gert thought they should be free and Nico had knit a purple scarf for Gert's thirteenth birthday, prompting Gert to dye her hair that color. Nico also told Gert that should Nico get hurt, Gert would be the leader of the group. The pair's friendship briefly breaks after Gert discovered Nico's kiss with Chase after their encounter with the Pusher Man. Their falling out caused much friction in the group. Nico and Gert finally resolved their differences with a short bout of tossing insults. Despite Gert's cynical attitude, she rarely argued with Nico's decisions and was usually prepared to stand by her friend. Nico experiences survivor's guilt after Gert dies, knowing that Gert's murderer Geoffrey Wilder had initially meant to kill Nico.Runaways: Volume 2, #18 =Victor Mancha= Nico explains that she seeks physical comfort after periods of stress. While Victor expresses feelings for Nico, she asks for time alone to clear her head and figure her feelings out, much like how she initially dealt with Alex and Karolina after each expressed feelings for Nico. However, Nico admits that Victor is genuinely a good guy and would not mind being in a relationship with him. Victor calls Nico his girlfriend when he attempts to save her from Chase, and although she is in a hostage situation, Nico still lightly scolds Victor for calling her such. The two eventually become a couple. However, the relationship is brief as Victor falls for Lillie, a carefree girl from 1907. Trying to become a better person, Nico, seeing that Victor and Lillie are in love, steps aside, deciding to remain friends even after Lillie decides to stay in the past. In other media =Television= *Nico Minoru appears in the Hulu television series Runaways portrayed by Lyrica Okano. This version of Nico became a goth after the death of her sister, Amy. After accidentally discovering the existence and powers of the Staff of One, her mother instructs her on how to use it. Nico grows closer to Alex while the two investigate the mystery surrounding Amy's death, but Nico later rejects Alex when she learns Alex hid information from her. Later, Karolina kisses Nico, revealing her feelings; the two begin a relationship. In this series, the Staff of One is portrayed as advanced technology instead of explicitly magic, with the need for blood to activate it being reinterpreted as the Staff being bonded to the DNA of Nico's mother, Tina, hence why only Tina and Nico can use it. The Staff retains its limitation of only being able to cast each \\"spell\\" once, although Nico can explore variations of this rule by casting spells with different command codes, such as initially starting a car with \\"Spark\\" and then using the command \\"Hotwire\\" to get it working again. =Video games= * Nico Minoru appears as a playable character in the Facebook game Marvel: Avengers Alliance.

When a U.S. Marshal has to break up a drug smuggling gang, he has to take to the skies.Floyd 2004, p. 329. Drop Zone was released by Paramount Pictures in the United States on December 9, 1994. Plot Aboard a commercial Boeing 747 airliner, U.S. Marshals Terry (Malcolm-Jamal Warner) and Pete Nessip (Wesley Snipes), are escorting computer expert Earl Leedy (Michael Jeter) to a high security prison. When an apparent terrorist hijack attempt blows a hole in the airliner, Terry is sucked out to his death, and the terrorists parachute out of the same hole, taking Leedy with them. Ex- DEA agent and renegade skydiver Ty Moncrief (Gary Busey) is the mastermind behind the attack, which culminated in the first ever parachute jump from a commercial jet at 30,000 feet. Ty plans to use Leedy to hack into the DEA mainframe computer in Washington, D.C. so Ty can auction off the names of undercover agents to drug cartels worldwide. Ty has scheduled this to be accomplished during an Independence Day parachute exhibition and fireworks display, which is the one day every year when security is loosened around the airspace above D.C. Pete believes that the assault may have been an elaborate prison break meant to free Leedy. However, the FBI declares that sneaking a parachute through airport security is impossible, and that parachuting at the jet's altitude and speed is not survivable. A devastated Pete is blamed for overreacting to the incident, and forced to turn in his badge. Undeterred, Pete consults a U.S. Navy high-altitude military parachuting instructor who confirms that he and his team have parachuted from that height and speed, but also states that the high-density metal rings in the parachutes would not pass airport metal detectors and that the operation required either rare skills or suicidal recklessness. The instructor believes the world class skydiver Dominic Jagger (Luca Bercovici) could perform the jump, but does not know his current whereabouts. Pete is instead referred to Jagger's reckless ex-wife, ex-con Jessie Crossman (Yancy Butler), who runs a skydiving school in the Florida Keys. Jessie, who is unaware that Jagger is part of Ty's crew, agrees to train Pete how to skydive, if he will sponsor her team for the parachute exhibition. Soon after, Jagger is found dead, tangled in some high voltage power lines, after his identity was exposed by a passenger during the hijacking. Jessie breaks into the police impound to examine Jagger's parachute, declares that his death was a murder engineered by Ty, and swears revenge. Pete inquires as to the parachute's lack of metal, which Jessie explains is a custom \\"smuggler's rig\\" made with high density fabrics to deter detection. When Pete discovers Ty's plan to hack into the DEA mainframe, the rest of the parachuting team agrees to help Pete with the situation. Jessie's parachuting friend Selkirk (Corin Nemec) is severely injured after using a faulty parachute that Ty had intended for Jessie to use. On the night of the Independence Day exhibition, Jessie sneaks into Ty's parachuting aircraft, holding them at gunpoint in order to determine an explanation for Jagger's death. But Ty's men kick her outside and then parachute out. Jessie, managing to grab hold of the aircraft door bar, lets go on a free fall just as Pete and the parachuting team arrive and rescue her, floating down safety to the roof of the DEA mainframe office building where Ty has already arrived. Pete tries to find access to the DEA mainframe control room, eliminating Ty's men one by one, with the help of the parachuting team. He breaks in and holds Leedy (who has already started downloading the identities) as hostage. Ty, having kidnapped Jessie, appears and threatens to kill her unless Pete releases Leedy. A fight breaks out between Pete and Ty that results in both of them falling out the building window. Luckily, Pete opens his emergency parachute as Ty tumbles to his death. Pete lands safely on the ground and is escorted away by paramedics, but spots Leedy wearing a DEA jacket leaving the scene. One of the team members, Swoop (Kyle Secor), leaps from the building, parachuting down onto Leedy and stopping him in his tracks. Pete tells Jessie jokingly that he would try skydiving again in 40 or 50 years.

The township comprises the communities of Blanchard's Landing, Bonfield, Grand Desert, and Rutherglen. The community of Bonfield is connected to Ontario Highway 17 by Ontario Highway 531, while Rutherglen is located directly on the route of Highway 17 and the other communities are located on local roads within the township. Named after James Bonfield (1825-1900), one-time M.P.P for South Renfrew in the Ontario legislature. Town and neighbouring township were amalgamated on January 1, 1975. In 2007, Bonfield, along with the town of Mattawa and the townships of Papineau- Cameron, Mattawan and Calvin cooperated to create a newly branded Mattawa Voyageur Country tourist region in order to promote the area.Adams, K. \\"Mattawa sports a new look\\", Baytoday.ca, July 17, 2007. Accessed March 28, 2008. History The community of Bonfield was first settled in 1882 as a station on the Canadian Pacific Railway. Located on the north shore of Lake Nosbonsing, where the railway crosses the Kaibuskong River, this place was originally named by the CPR as Callander Station. The community of Callander, on the South-East Bay of Lake Nipissing, had been named Callander in 1880, to honour the birthplace in Scotland of Duncan McIntyre, then president of the Canada Central Railway (CCR). It was at this place on the shore of Lake Nipissing, that the CCR intended to connect with the proposed eastern terminus of the CPR. In 1881 the Canada Central Railway was merged into the Canadian Pacific, as McIntyre became its vice president. As construction of the railway approached Lake Nipissing from the east, it turned away from the South-East Bay, towards the North Bay of Lake Nipissing instead. This was the closest point the CPR would come to the village of Callander, therefore this place was named Callander Station. After the Northern and Pacific Junction Railway established a station in the original village of Callander in 1886 and was taken over by the Grand Trunk Railway in 1888, there was much confusion between the station in Callander and Callander Station. The CPR location, Callander Station was renamed Bonfield, adopting the name of the township in which it is located.

The character debuted in the award-winning series Runaways. Like every member of the original Runaways, she is the daughter of evil villains with special abilities; after the other older Runaways learn more about themselves, they raid Molly's home to find out her mutant abilities had already manifested. Often called \\"Mol\\" for short, Molly is the youngest Runaway and her innocence often serves as humor in the series, but she has demonstrated great insight at critical moments. Molly was originally the team's sole mutant; despite having telepathic mutant parents, Molly's mutant powers are superhuman strength and invulnerability. She used to be the youngest member of the team, but after inviting fellow mutant Klara Prast to join, Molly takes comfort in having another mutant and someone her own age. She is extremely proud of her mutant heritage and admires the X-Men. Runaways creator Brian K. Vaughan played a significant role in the character's subsequent development as well as artist/writer Adrian Alphona. Molly was named after Runaways creator Brian K. Vaughan's younger sister, Molly Hayes Vaughan. Her trademark is an expansive lineup of hats displayed throughout the series. In 2009, Molly was named the fourth (out of ten) toughest females in the Marvel Universe, after Rogue, She- Hulk and Ms. Marvel. The character was reimagined as Molly Hayes Hernandez and portrayed by Allegra Acosta in the Hulu television series Runaways. Publication history Molly Hayes was created by author Brian K. Vaughan & artist Adrian Alphona and debuted in Runaways #1. Production Molly was one of the few Runaways to actually keep the name she had in Brian K. Vaughan's original proposal; she is named after Vaughan's younger sister, Molly Hayes Vaughan. However, in the original pitch for the series, Molly's parents were Hollywood actors. This would eventually become the cover story of Karolina's parents. Also, Molly's sibling-like relationship with Chase was originally supposed to be with Gert and this was shown in Hulu's version of the Runaways. Molly was supposed to be thirteen years old in the original pitch instead of eleven. Fictional character biography =The Pride= Cover to Runaways vol. 1 #15 Art by Jo Chen. Molly is with friends Alex Wilder, Karolina Dean, Gertrude Yorkes, Chase Stein, and Nico Minoru when they observe their parents calling themselves The Pride and preparing the ritual sacrifice of a young girl. Molly is preemptively escorted away by Karolina while the older children watch the sacrifice commence. They inform Karolina and decide to run away from their homes that very night. After discovering their powers and gifts, the older five kids rescue Molly from her home. Molly awakes from a psychically-induced slumber during the runaways' rescue and sees her mother being threatened by Nico. Molly's mutant powers manifest at that moment in a display of glowing pink hair and eyes. However, Molly first uses her strength to knock Leslie Dean out of the sky, saving Gert. Molly promptly falls asleep from exhaustion and the Runaways take her to their new hideout, a dilapidated mansion called \\"the Hostel\\". Throughout the first volume of the series, Molly is skeptical that her parents were accomplices to murder and is unsure why the group ran away in the first place. However, she is excited at the prospect of becoming a superhero and enthusiastically takes the codename \\"Princess Powerful,\\" while her teammates dub her \\"Bruiser.\\" Shortly after their \\"superhero\\" careers begin, the Runaways take in fellow runaway Topher, who turns out to be a vampire. He dies by ingesting Karolina's solar-irradiated blood and when Molly witnesses Topher's death, she realizes that the superhero life is not a game, and cries for her mother. Alex later deciphers a text kept by his parents called the Abstract, and informs the Runaways about their parents' activities as The Pride, their ties to the Gibborim (the Pride's Biblical benefactors), and their ultimate goal of exterminating all human life save for the six most loyal Pride members. Molly expresses disinterest in the Pride's motivations, but is excited when Alex plots to disrupt the Pride's ritual sacrifice to the Gibborim. When the Runaways encounter the Pride, Molly witnesses first-hand why she and her friends have been in hiding for months and destroys the sacrifice prepared for the Gibborim. She escapes with the Runaways when the Gibborim attack the Pride for losing the sacrifice. After the Pride's demise, Molly is sent to X-Corp for foster care, but breaks out with Gert's help and runs away with the rest of the team. =Runaways= After being energized, Molly tosses the weight of a skyscraper-sized monster in Runaways vol. 2 #20. Art by Adrian Alphona. In the second volume, Molly fights under Nico's command and witnesses the future Gert die in Chase's arms as she warns the Runaways about the future supervillain named Victor Mancha. Molly participates in the search, and during the second fight with Excelsior, Molly discerns Chamber's fake accent; he is later revealed to be Geoffrey Wilder in disguise. After Victor joins the team, Molly accompanies him on group shopping trips under Nico's orders because she believes that Molly is the only individual member of the Runaways capable of bringing Victor down should he betray the team. During the runaways' trip to New York City to exonerate Cloak, Molly meets her idol and childish crush Wolverine, but he scares her and she hurls him out of a church, thereafter maintaining a severe dislike of him. During the adventure, The Punisher pursues the group in the mistaken belief that they are criminals. Molly stops him with a single punch, only to become distressed when she realizes the Punisher has no superpowers and that she has really hurt him. After the Runaways solve the case, they return to Los Angeles, but Wolverine and the X-Men follow them, looking to enroll Molly in Xavier's School For Gifted Youngsters. After a short altercation, the X-Men leave Molly alone, realizing that it would be unfair to force her to enroll. During one mission, Molly gets separated from the team and the Provost abducts her. He coerces Molly and other children into robbing banks for him. Molly rallies the children to stage a coup, and she finds her way back to the Runaways. Molly is abducted in a battle with a second incarnation of the Pride, made up of Alex's MMORPG friends and led by a younger version of Alex's father, Geoffrey. Nico rescues Molly with Xavin's aid, but Gert dies covering their escape. After Gert's death, Molly asks the Leapfrog, the group's transport, if Gert went to Heaven, but it cannot reply since Heaven is not on any of the maps in its database. Soon afterwards, Molly begins hearing a disembodied voice she believes is Gert's, and follows its instructions to help revive Victor. She helps Victor rescue Nico from the Gibborim and subsequently joins the team on their cross-country trek to evade Iron Man and S.H.I.E.L.D. The voice Molly heard is later revealed to have been Alex's. Molly is referenced in New X-Men #42 (November 2007): when Mercury researches for the youngest mutant in the world, Hellion asks about Molly, whom he believes to be five years old. The Stepford Cuckoos inform Julian he is incorrect.New X-Men Vol 2 #42 =Mollifest Destiny= In Runaways #10, the Runaways travel to San Francisco after Molly receives Emma Frost's psychic message inviting all mutants to a new safe Haven. Molly's non-stop chatter quickly annoys several of the X-Men and Wolverine gives her a tour of the X-Men's new base of operations. Molly begins to annoy Wolverine and the two argue until he insults Molly's parents and calls her a brat, causing her to throw him through the roof.Runaways #10 (May 2009) Wolverine is urged by Cyclops and Emma Frost to take Molly outside, and complies. The two tour San Francisco before they are kidnapped by a villain that was an enemy of the Pride. The villain and his soldiers had attempted to claim a portion of Los Angeles, although the Hayes stopped him, massacring his men and putting him in a traumatizing seven-year coma where he could not close his eyes, all for their own sadistic enjoyment. He recovered and seeks revenge against them by telling Molly her parents were evil and sadistic, having killed innocent people and children. He calls them far worse than any super villain, and ultimately plans on killing her as his final act of revenge. Wolverine and Molly manage to defeat him, though Molly realizes she'll never think of her parents the same way again. She is, however, comforted by Wolverine, who says that despite their villainous ways, her parents must have genuinely loved her in order to \\"raise a kid as good as her.\\" =Heroic Age= In Uncanny X-Men: The Heroic Age #1 Beast is waiting for Abigail Brand at what seems to be an outdoor exhibition of fossil animals - as it turns out, it's the La Brea Tar Pits. Brand doesn't show up, and instead it's Molly who walks by. Molly tells him \\"the guys\\" have given her homework and asks him to tell her about extinction, but it's clear she actually wants to talk about the Decimation of mutants. She's heard about the Five Lights and clings to the hope, whereas Beast tries to talk her out of getting her expectations too high, until she finally punches him and runs away. He follows and manages to calm her down by telling her that mutant extinction does not mean that they would die any earlier than usually, but just that their children and grandchildren would be normal people. So, he tells her, all they could do was make the best of their lives so that, after all the mutants would be extinct, they would be remembered as having been worthy of their gifts. Molly makes a cameo appearance in New Avengers #7, as one of the applicants Luke Cage and Jessica Jones interview as a possible nanny. Molly begins by saying she knows she's underage, but she is cut off.New Avengers #7 When Daken, the psychopathic son of Wolverine seeks the Runaways in Los Angeles, Molly pins him down and angrily asks why he's invaded their home.Daken: Dark Wolverine #17 As part of the Marvel NOW! event, Molly Hayes is the only one to notice that Nico and Chase are missing and turns to Hank Pym for help. The rest of the Marvel Universe, for whatever reason, does not think twice about the mass disappearances.Avengers Arena #13 Molly later appears in the pages of Avengers Undercover where she and Karolina visit Nico and Chase in the S.H.I.E.L.D. detention center after Hazmat killed Arcade.Avengers Undercover #4 After the Runaways went their separate ways, Molly was taken in by her grandmother, who Molly soon recognized was 'evil' even if not to the same extent as her parents. During Molly's time with her grandmother, she learned that the grandmother was her direct maternal grandmother, who had taken in Molly's father when he ran away, and carried out various genetic research to give Molly's parents their powers, accounting for how Molly's family could share the same mutant power. Molly's grandmother eventually reveals her true agenda to try and genetically recreate Molly's dead parents, but Molly rejects this idea, choosing instead to return to the Runaways (who now include the resurrected Gert and the bodyless head of Victor Mancha). Missing school life, Molly asked Nico to use her magic and legally enroll her in middle school. There she met a girl named Abigail, with whom she became fast friends.Runaways Vol.5 #7 (2018) Eventually, Abigail confined in her that she was ageless, and gave her an enchanted cupcake once provided to her by the EnchantressRunaways Vol.5 #10 (2018) which would enable Molly to stay young forever.Runaways Vol.5 #8 (2018) However, while Molly was hesitant about whether or not she should accept, the cupcake was inadvertently consumed by Julie Power, who was visiting the Runaways, turning her into a 13-year-old again.Runaways Vol.5 #9 (2018) The Runaways procured the antidote the Enchantress provided with the cupcakes, against Abigail's wishes, which broke their relationship. Powers and abilities Originally, Molly's mutant power was superhuman strength, with which she has toppled a giant monster bigger than a skyscraper, tunneled through miles of rock, and broken solid objects over her head. However, Molly was only able to use her powers for a limited amount of time before she became fatigued and fell asleep. When she first used her powers, Molly fell asleep after only throwing one punch, but as the series continued, Molly has been able to use her powers for increasingly longer periods of time and to greater extremes without tiring. Nico once used the Staff of One to give Molly a caffeine rush while fighting a giant monster to keep her awake longer. Molly was later revealed to have invulnerability as well, as evident when Excavator of the Wrecking Crew smashes his enchanted shovel over Molly's head, causing the shovel to crack into pieces. Despite the fact that Molly's mutation is entirely different from her telepathic parents, her eyes still glow a violet-pink (yellow in the web television series) when using her powers, just like her parents. Molly's strength has failed her on two occasions - she wasn't able to punch the adamantium armor of a Doctor Doombot, and she wasn't able to get out of Leslie Dean's unbreakable Majesdanian bonds. Reception In 2009, Molly was ranked the fourth strongest lady in the Marvel Universe, after Rogue, She-Hulk and Ms. Marvel. The ranking is based on the opinions of a select group of Marvel employees and do not reflect the official position of Marvel. In 2008, Marvel.com's list of ten best teen heroes featured Molly as a hypothetical number eleven, citing her too-young age as the reason she could not be on the regular list. In 2007, the Runaways made the list at number five of ten for best teams, citing the best Runaway's moment was when Molly and Victor made their version of the X-Men's \\"Fastball Special\\". Relationships Although Molly enjoys being independent and a superhero, she is still a pre-adolescent girl who wants to have fun. Most of her close relationships are based on who is willing to spend the most time playing with her. Molly also has a tendency throughout the series to gravitate towards people that she can look up to as a big sibling. =Chase Stein= In the beginning of the series, Molly and Chase Stein engage in a big brother/little sister relationship: they bicker, call each other names, and horse around. Chase always stands up to protect Molly. As the series progresses, Chase and Molly grow apart, primarily due to his romantic involvement with Gert. In issues #18-#24 of volume 2, Chase distances himself from Molly and the rest of the Runaways to deal with his grief over Gert's death. However, in the Civil War: Young Avengers/Runaways miniseries, Chase expresses jealousy over Molly's growing attachment to Speed. Though they are not as close as before, Chase and Molly's relationship seems to have been repaired after Chase moved past grieving for Gert. =Victor Mancha= Molly meets Victor Mancha when the Runaways abduct him from his high school, hoping to preempt the prophecy that Victor will one day kill the Earth's heroes. Molly adjusts rather quickly to Victor's addition to the team; she spends more time off the battlefield with Victor than most, playing board games with him and pairing up to go shopping. During one of their trips, it's revealed that Nico has ordered Molly to \\"babysit\\" Victor, because she is the only individual member strong enough to take Victor down if he goes haywire. Molly tells Victor that she's not particularly scared of him, and is willing to give him the benefit of the doubt regarding his supposed future. Victor surmises that Molly is simply using flattery to get him to buy her favorite cereal, but since she treats him as an equal and consistently spends time with him, he concludes that Molly was not just \\"sucking up.\\" As Molly's relationship with Chase deteriorated, her relationship with Victor grew stronger. =Xavin= Though Xavin was initially hostile towards all the Runaways (except Karolina) she has shown a great amount of concern for Molly's well-being. She returned to Earth with Karolina after their failed wedding as the Runaways were attempting to locate Molly after she was abducted by the second Pride; Xavin immediately volunteered to help the search efforts to locate \\"the hatchling.\\" Xavin is another one of Molly's frequent board game partners; during one of their gaming sessions, Molly expressed her discomfort with Xavin constantly shifting between forms and said that most of the team felt the same way. Despite this, Xavin still fought the Gibborim without hesitation to protect the team, after which Molly admitted that Xavin's consistent selflessness more than makes up for the shapeshifting. The two now share a close camaraderie. =Gertrude Yorkes= During the series, Gertrude Yorkes was a quasi-role model for Molly. Gert was usually the one that Molly asked most of her questions to and they were normally paired together to guard the Hostel and their getaway car. When Gert was killed at the hands of Geoffrey Wilder, Molly spent time sitting in front of a photo of Gert in the new Hostel's photo wall. Molly would talk to Gert as if she were really there. She also asked the Leapfrog if Gert went to Heaven (although it was unable to answer because \\"Heaven\\" was not on any of the Leapfrog's maps). In at least one instance, Molly seems to gain specific information from an unknown voice only she can hear, which she assumed to be the voice of Gert; in reality it was the voice of Alex Wilder, in an attempt to redeem himself and escape Limbo. =Klara Prast= When they travel to the past, Karolina introduced Molly to a girl in distress named Klara Prast, to help reach out to her because they are closer in age. Molly invites her to join the team, and together they manage to convince her to come with them to escape her tragic fate of being married to an abusive husband (the graver physically and possibly sexually abusive aspects of which Molly does not fully seem to understand due to her comparatively sheltered life). When Klara is upset by Karolina's seemingly interracial lesbian relationship, it causes a rift between her and Molly, as Molly defends Karolina and cannot relate to Klara's homophobic and racist attitudes, a result of her upbringing. Klara is visibly saddened by the confrontation (her emotions reflected in her roses) and leaves. Later, she returns, beaten by her husband, and the team accepts her back. While the two girls have very different personalities, with Molly feeling young compared to Klara who has weathered a lot of difficulties in her life, they remain close. Other versions =Battle of the Atom= An adult version of Molly Hayes appears as a member of a future team of X-Men in the X-Men 50th Anniversary crossover, Battle of the Atom. Led by Kate Pryde, these X-Men arrive from their time to inform the present day X-Men that the original five X-Men must return to their proper place in time, as their presence in the current timeline will result in disastrous consequences for mutantkind.X-Men: Battle of the Atom #1 This team is eventually revealed, following the arrival of their era's true team of X-Men, to be, in actuality, their timeline's version of the Brotherhood of Mutants, with Kate Pryde revealed to actually be Raze, the shapeshifting son of Wolverine and Mystique.X-Men (Vol. 4) #6 As an adult, Molly has grown into a tall, muscular woman and appears to have outgrown the chronic fatigue she formerly exhibited after using her powers. She also harbors a grudge against her timeline's Colossus as a result of the event which originally splintered the two teams.Uncanny X-Men (Vol. 3) #13 Following the Brotherhood's defeat, Molly hid with her team.X-Men: Battle of the Atom #2 Molly and the Brotherhood members have survived and infiltrate Cyclops' new school.All-New X-Men #26 The Brotherhood is defeated by the past- Jean Grey's mind powers, it is revealed that Molly and the Brotherhood members are being under the mind control of Charles Xavier II and subdues him. Molly and the former Brotherhood are freed and return to their future.All-New X-Men #29 =Secret Wars= During Secret Wars under the Battleworld banner, Molly makes a cameo in A-Force as a resident of the Battleworld domain of Arcadia. A version of her from Battleworld's Kingdom of Manhattan is featured as a major character in the alternative version of the Battleworld version of the Runaways. In other media =Television= Allegra Acosta plays Molly in the Hulu television series, Runaways with her surname changed to Hernandez and Hayes being her middle name instead. Due to 20th Century Fox owning the X-Men and the word 'Mutant', Molly's origin is changed. She is instead a mutate with her powers seeming to come from strange rocks her parents had studied prior. Prior to the series opening, Molly's parents died in a fire and she was adopted by the Yorkes. She discovers that she has superhuman strength early on after suffering cramps and later on at home discovers a dinosaur in the basement. She begs Gert to take her away and they head to Alex's house. At Alex's house she meets her friends and while the gathering is awkward, they soon discover a secret passage in the house that leads to their parents sacrificing Destiny in a ritual. Molly's camera flash is seen by there parents. The group agree to deny seeing anything in order to figure out what Pride is doing and how to stop them. Alex's mother, Catherine, finds a hair bow that belongs to Molly and begins to question her. Molly convinces Catherine that she was told to look for alcohol by the others. Molly then questions Catherine about her parents, with Catherine promising to tell her about them another time. Molly, in an effort to know more about her parents, accidentally lets slip to Catherine about her knowledge of Pride. Geoffrey and Catherine tell Dale and Stacy that they must do something about Molly as she knows about Pride's activities. They tell Molly she is going to be sent away which angers her and Gert comforts her. While living with her relative, Graciela, Molly is given a letter containing a key which leads her to a locker that holds a VHS tape. Molly returns to the group with the VHS tape which contains a video from her parents warning her about Pride's activities. Molly and the others decide to use the school dance as a cover to infiltrate the drilling site. Molly uses her strength to push a dump truck into the drill hole in an attempt to stop the drill. Pride arrives and learn of Molly's and her friend's powers. Failing to stop them, Karolina is taken while Molly and the others escape. Molly and Chase sneak into the Church of Gibborim and rescue Karolina. Molly and the others then go to a bus station, but are forced to go on the run after the others are accused of kidnapping Molly and killing the girl that Pride had murdered. =Video games= * Molly Hayes appeared as a playable character in the Facebook video game Marvel: Avengers Alliance. * Molly Hayes is a playable character in Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2.

The station is 27 metres below ground level and 22 metres below sea level. It is positioned 600 metres east of the Central Railway Station and 900 metres south of Hakaniemi. Both lines M1 and M2 serve the station. The station's ticket hall.  History  The location of the metro station was decided in 1971, and the station box was excavated during the metro's original construction work in the late 1970s. The station's opening date was postponed due to a lack of funds. The station was eventually opened on 1 March 1995, having been designed by the architect firm Kontio - Kilpi - Valjento Oy. The station is equipped with a glass-sided funicular- style elevator, operating along the slope parallel to the escalators.  Renaming  In April 2014, the city council voted to rename the station from Kaisaniemi to University of Helsinki. The rebranding was completed in January 2015 to commemorate the university's 375th anniversary.

Risk in a PRA is defined as a feasible detrimental outcome of an activity or action. In a PRA, risk is characterized by two quantities: #the magnitude (severity) of the possible adverse consequence(s), and #the likelihood (probability) of occurrence of each consequence. Consequences are expressed numerically (e.g., the number of people potentially hurt or killed) and their likelihoods of occurrence are expressed as probabilities or frequencies (i.e., the number of occurrences or the probability of occurrence per unit time). The total risk is the expected loss: the sum of the products of the consequences multiplied by their probabilities. The spectrum of risks across classes of events are also of concern, and are usually controlled in licensing processes ‚Äì it would be of concern if rare but high consequence events were found to dominate the overall risk, particularly as these risk assessments are very sensitive to assumptions (how rare is a high consequence event?). Probabilistic Risk Assessment usually answers three basic questions: #What can go wrong with the studied technological entity or stressor, or what are the initiators or initiating events (undesirable starting events) that lead to adverse consequence(s)? #What and how severe are the potential detriments, or the adverse consequences that the technological entity (or the ecological system in the case of a PERA) may be eventually subjected to as a result of the occurrence of the initiator? #How likely to occur are these undesirable consequences, or what are their probabilities or frequencies? Two common methods of answering this last question are event tree analysis and fault tree analysis ‚Äì for explanations of these, see safety engineering. In addition to the above methods, PRA studies require special but often very important analysis tools like human reliability analysis (HRA) and common-cause-failure analysis (CCF). HRA deals with methods for modeling human error while CCF deals with methods for evaluating the effect of inter-system and intra-system dependencies which tend to cause simultaneous failures and thus significant increase in overall risk.  PSA for nuclear power plants  One point of possible objection interests the uncertainties associated with a PSA. The PSA (Probabilistic Safety Assessment) has often no associated uncertainty, though in metrology any measure shall be related to a secondary measurement uncertainty, and in the same way any mean frequency number for a random variable shall be examined with the dispersion inside the set of data. For example, without specifying an uncertainty level, the Japanese regulatory body, the Nuclear Safety Commission issued restrictive safety goal in terms of qualitative health objectives in 2003, such that individual fatality risks should not exceed 10‚àí6/year. Then it was translated in a safety goal for nuclear power plants: * for reactors of type BWR-4, in: ** Core Damage Frequency (CDF): 1.6 √ó 10‚àí7 /year, ** Containment Failure Frequency (CFF): 1.2 √ó 10‚àí8 /yr * for reactors of type BWR-5, in: ** CDF: 2.4 √ó 10‚àí8 /year, and ** CFF: 5.5 √ó 10‚àí9 /yr for The second point is a possible lack of design in order to prevent and mitigate the catastrophic events, which has the lowest probability of the event and biggest magnitude of the impact, and the lowest degree of uncertainty about their magnitude. A cost-effective of the factor of safety, contribute to undervaluate or completely ignore this type of remote safety risk-factors. Designers choose if the system has to be dimensioned and positioned at the mean or for the minimum level of probability-risk (with related costs of safety measures), for being resilient and robust in relation to the fixed value. Such external events may be natural hazard, including earth quake and tsunami, fire, and terrorist attacks, and are treated as a probabilistic argument. Changing historical context shall condition the probability of those events, e.g. a nuclear program or economic sanctions.

According to the , it has a population of people. History In 1595, the Franciscan missionaries under the leadership of Fr. Juan de Placencia and Fr. Diego de Oropesa, founded a ‚Äúvisita‚Äù for Morong on the present site of Bosoboso, south of Painaan with Apostol Santiago as its patron saint. It was known as ‚ÄúVisita de Santiago‚Äù or Santiago until such time that it became Baras. Baras was then inhabited by 400 Aetas and other mountain people. In 1636, the town was transferred to a place called Ibayo, one and one-half leagues southeast of the first site due to the hostility of the Aetas and the mountaineers who burned part of the town and church in 1635. San Salvador became their patron saint. However, the town and church of Baras was burned by Chinese rebels in 1639, who were retreating from Manila to the Sierra Madre mountains. The ecclesiastical administration of Baras was given back by the Jesuits to the Franciscan in 1679. Two years later In 1682, the town was transferred to its present site where they would not be menaced by marauding tribes of the mountaineers. Baras was under the jurisdiction of the Province of Laguna from 1606 to 1853. Its administration was transferred to the newly created Distrito de las Monte de San Mateo in 1857. This district was changed to Distrito de Morong whose capital was in Antipolo but was later transferred to Morong. In July 1895, the representatives of Katipunan came to inform the people of Morong, Tanay, Antipolo, Baras and Pililla about the cause of the secret society. The Katipuan of Baras established the Real or Military Camp at sitio of Gogo or Pamitinan. On November 21, 1896, the Katipunan attempted to capture the town of Morong but were driven by the Guardia Civil. By 1898, Baras had joined the Revolutionary Government of Emilio Aguinaldo. After the defeat of the Spaniards in Morong, the Aguinaldo Headquarters ordered the establishment of the municipal township. A special election was held. However, the Revolutionary Government of Aguinaldo did not last because of the outbreak of the Filipino-American War. On March 29, 1900, Military Order No. 40, by Governor General Meritt came in effect. This order was for the election of an Alcalde Municipal, Vice Alcalde, and the Municipal Council. This was implemented in October of the same year. Act 942 was passed by the Philippine Commission in 1902, providing the establishment of the Province of Rizal to be comprised in part of towns from the former Distrito de Morong. Baras effectively became part of the new province. However, in 1903, it was relegated to be a barrio under the town of Morong. On January 16, 1906, Baras was annexed to Tanay as a barrio by Act No. 1442. But as Baras was not represented as a barrio of Tanay, and previously under Morong, there was a movement for the separation of Baras as an independent town. Under the leadership of Leopoldo Digma, the clamor was realized through Executive Order No. 57, dated November 24, 1920 establishing the Municipality of Baras. =World War II and after= During the Second World War, the Imperial Japanese armed forces occupied and entered the municipal town of Baras in 1942. The local guerrillas of the General Marking Unit sieged and invaded the town of Baras and attacked the Japanese from 1942 to 1945. The local Filipino troops of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and the Philippine Constabulary units liberated the municipality of Baras in 1945. The guerrillas of the General Marking Units defeated the Japanese forces and it ended World War II. The Military General Headquarters and Camp Bases of the 53rd Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army was established and active from January 3, 1942 to June 30, 1946 and built Camp Caparas in Baras. The military engagements of the Anti-Japanese Operations in Manila and Southern Luzon aided the local guerrilla resistance fighters and U.S. military forces against the Japanese Imperial forces. The town of Baras was razed to the ground on March 10, 1945. This signified the liberation of the town but also left many homeless. The rehabilitation of the town began. War damage claims were filed to the amount of P 300,000 to be used for the construction of new houses. Then mayor, Mariano Golla, focused on the improvement of roads and the construction of a public dispensary. Under his term, Baras was elevated to a fourth class municipality due to an increase in income. Under the succeeding administrations, improvements of road networks were implemented; seven liberty wells were constructed; the number of school houses were increased; river controls in Barangay San Juan and San Jose were constructed; rehabilitation of the existing government building continued; and a reforestation program was launched.

It was a collaboration between the Impact India Foundation (IIF), Indian Railways (IR) and the Health Ministry. The train is funded by IIF, international charitable sources, Indian corporations and individuals. The train has made a health impact both in India, as well as around the world where it has inspired similar initiatives. Objective The Lifeline Express was started to provide on-the-spot diagnostic, medical and advanced surgical treatment for preventive and curative interventions for disabled adults and children. It is an outreach program for inaccessible rural areas where medical services are not available, traveling via Indian Railways. In addition to providing access to these much needed services, the Lifeline express seeks to improve the efficiency of the existing local government and voluntary health infrastructure and services, as well as providing initiative and encouragement for the local bodies to get involved in all aspects of the programme and provide follow-up services after the train has left. History The Lifeline Express went on its maiden journey on 16 July 1991. Three coaches were donated by IR, and the equipment from Impact India Foundation. Impact India Foundation is the Indian branch of a non-profit organisation based in seven countries around the world, with its Indian headquarters in Mumbai. Impact India still runs the trains with help from IR and corporate and private donors. After 16 years of work (93 projects in different parts of India) from the Lifeline Express, IR provided the Lifeline Express with five new coaches, for the new and improved Jeevan Rekha Express. There was just one operation theater in the old one; however according to the CEO of the Lifeline Express Dr. Rajnish Gourh the operation theatres would be doubled now. The rest of the setup remains same. Indian Railways built upon its experience operating the Lifeline Express during the COVID-19 pandemic in India, when it converted sleeper cars into isolation wards for coronavirus patients. Services Inauguration of the two additional coaches for Cancer and Family Health Services The Lifeline Express provides a number of medical services including * Orthopaedic surgical intervention for correction of handicap and restoration of movement, especially those as a result of polio, congenital deformity like club foot & cerebral palsy. * Ophthalmological procedures and interventions, e.g. cataract surgery including phaco method and power glasses distribution after establishing the need of partially blind patients. * Surgical interventions for conductive deformity of middle ear for restoration of hearing & Audiometry for restoring hearing of sensory deaf patients. * Plastic Surgical correction of Cleft Lip and post burn contractures. * Epilepsy - Screening and treatment clinic run by an Epileptologist along with counselling and education about epilepsy given by Epilepsy counsellors * Counselling and referral services. * Liaison with local health authorities and follow-up. * Immunisations and other preventive measures. * Nutritional assessment and services. * Promotion of Health awareness among the deprived in the neglected rural and semi-urban areas * Providing training to medical and allied-health professionals and other voluntary personnel in surgical procedures, medical and health issues for work in unique field situations. The train visits different parts of the country, usually rural areas with insufficient Health Care facilities, or areas hit by natural disasters, etc., and stays in each place for 21 to 25 days while medical care (routine as well as major surgery) is provided to the local people. The train which was started in 1991 is still operating. Facilities Dignitaries visiting the Lifeline Express, 2016 The Lifeline Express train is formed of specially-designed air-conditioned coaches. In 2007 Indian Railways provided five new coaches for the service. The first coach is a power car which also has a staff compartment and pantry area. The staff compartment is situated at the rear with a 12-berth staff-quarter, kitchen unit, water purifier, a gas stove and electric oven and refrigerator. The second coach consists of the medical store, as well as two autoclave units. It also houses a drawing room. The train has a main Operation Theatre with three operating tables and a second self-contained operating theatre with two tables. In the main theatre, each table has its own set of anesthetic equipment, shadow lights, Boyles apparatus with Halothane vapourisers and imported Carl Zeiss microscope, multi-purpose monitor, defibrillator, diathermy cautery machine, anesthesia ventilator. The theatres are equipped with a closed circuit television camera which is used in providing training to local doctors in live surgical procedures. An attached six bed recovery room is situated beside the main theatre. Additionally, the train has an ophthalmologic testing room, a dental unit, a laboratory, an X-ray unit and an auditorium with a large LCD display unit. The train also has a public address system and closed-circuit TV.

Daugherty of the Los Angeles Science Fantasy Society. The original full name was West Coast Scienti-Fantasy Conference. Organization The location of Westercon each year is determined by a bid and voting process by the convention's members. Sites are selected two years in advance. Acceptable locations are cites on the continent of North America, west of the 104th meridian west, or in the state of Hawaii. (Sites in Australia would be eligible as well if either Australia or the United States were to annex the other, as a consequence of a whimsical provision added to the convention's bylaws in 1998 at the suggestion of Down Under Fan Fund delegate Terry Frost. Although this provision may have little practical effect, an attempt to repeal it at the 2003 Westercon Business Meeting failed.) Guests of Honor are traditionally chosen to showcase professionals who reside in the Westercon region. Given that there are hundreds of potential honorees, it is preferred that guests are chosen that have not been guests of honor at a previous Westercon. Westercon is traditionally four days long, and is traditionally held on a weekend adjacent to or including the American Independence Day holiday. The name \\"Westercon\\" is a service mark of the Los Angeles Science Fantasy Society, and LASFS retains certain responsibilities regarding Westercon site selection and provisions in case of the failure of a Westercon committee. In practice, Westercon is left to organize itself, with each year's committee acting independently and in its own name, with the general organization (primarily rules for site selection and self-governance) managed through the convention's Bylaws and a Business Meeting (open to all members) held at each Westercon. Traditions Through the years several events and activities are traditionally held at Westercon. These events are common to most science fiction and fantasy conventions. Westercon is traditionally four days long; however, due to it traditionally being held near the American Independence Day holiday, the actual days of the week on which it is held vary from year to year, and this can affect the precise timing of events. Westercon traditionally includes those functions that other general science fiction and fantasy conventions have, including programming on a variety of subjects related to science fiction, fantasy, and fandom. Westercon also includes an art show and a dealers room. The First Night Icebreaker or \\"Meet the Guests\\" event is held on the first evening of programming to allow an informal setting for members to meet the professional attendees of the convention. Mike Glyer introduced the ice cream social as a convention icebreaker in 1978 -- borrowing it from Loscon -- but it has not been a part of every convention. A costume contest called a Masquerade is typically held on the second night sometimes of the convention (or sometimes on Saturday night, regardless of when the convention started). A Regency dance has been a staple for many years, with a rock and roll dance being held as well at least one night of the convention. Because Westercon members vote on where the Westercon two years hence will be held, site selection voting is generally open on the first and second days of the convention, with the results announced on the third day. A Business Meeting at which all members of Westercon may propose, debate, and vote upon changes to the convention's bylaws is usually on the second day of the convention, and, if necessary, also on the third day to deal with issues not resolved at the first meeting. In the evenings, groups host parties for various reasons. Some are promoting other conventions or bids for future Westercons or Worldcons. Others are publicizing groups or clubs and many are just for fun.

The basic premise involves an Irish Catholic girl and a young Jewish man who marry despite the objections of their families. Theater and films Although initially receiving poor reviews, the Broadway play was a commercial hit, running for 2,327 performances between May 23, 1922, and October 1, 1927, at the time the longest run in Broadway theater history, surpassing the record 1,291 performances set by the Winchell Smith and Frank Bacon 1918 play, Lightnin'.W. R. Benet, The Reader's Encyclopedia, 1948, s.v. \\"Abie's Irish Rose\\"; Long Runs in the Theater website \\"Abroad\\", The Manchester Guardian June 2, 1927, ProQuest Historical Newspapers, The Guardian and The Observer, p. 15 The show's touring company had a similarly long run and held the record for longest running touring company for nearly 40 years until the record was broken by Hello, Dolly! in the 1960s. The touring company's male lead was played by a young George Brent, the future Hollywood actor's first major role, and the female lead was played by Peggy Parry. Abie's Irish Rose was revived on Broadway in 1937 and again in an updated version in 1954. The play was twice the inspiration for films: in 1928 with Charles \\"Buddy\\" Rogers and Nancy Carroll, directed by Victor Fleming, and in 1946 with Richard Norris and Joanne Dru, directed by A. Edward Sutherland. The 1946 version, produced by Bing Crosby, met with considerable published controversy. Radio It inspired the weekly NBC radio series, Abie's Irish Rose, which replaced Knickerbocker Playhouse and ran from January 24, 1942, through September 2, 1944. Faced with listener protests about its stereotyped ethnic portrayals, the radio series was cancelled in 1945. Nichols wrote the scripts. Axel Gruenbert and Joe Rines directed the cast that starred Richard Bond, Sydney Smith, Richard Coogan and Clayton \\"Bud\\" Collyer as Abie Levy. Betty Winkler, Mercedes McCambridge, Julie Stevens, Bernard Gorcey, and Marion Shockley portrayed Rosemary Levy. Solomon Levy was played by Alfred White, Charlie Cantor and Alan Reed. Others in the radio cast: Walter Kinsella (as Patrick Murphy), Menasha Skulnik (Isaac Cohen), Anna Appel (Mrs. Cohen), Ann Thomas (Casey), Bill Adams (Father Whelan), Amanda Randolph (maid) and Dolores Gillenas (the Levys' twins). The announcer was Howard Petrie, and Joe Stopak provided the music. The opening theme music was \\"My Wild Irish Rose\\" by Chauncey Olcott. The basic premise was extensively copied, and Anne Nichols sued one imitator, Universal Pictures, which produced The Cohens and Kellys, a motion picture play about an Irish boy who marries a Jewish girl from feuding families. However, in Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corp., the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found for the defendant, holding that copyright protection cannot be extended to the characteristics of stock characters in a story, whether it be a book, play or film. Plot Nichols' original Broadway play had the couple meeting in France during World War I, with the young man having been a soldier and the girl a nurse who had tended to him. In Nichols‚Äô version, the priest and the rabbi from the wedding are also veterans of the same war, and recognize one another from their time in the service. The rest of the plot was summarized by Judge Learned Hand, in his opinion in the copyright lawsuit filed by Nichols: :Abie's Irish Rose presents a Jewish family living in prosperous circumstances in New York. The father, a widower, is in business as a merchant, in which his son and only child helps him. The boy has philandered with young women, who to his father's great disgust have always been Gentiles, for he is obsessed with a passion that his daughter-in-law shall be an orthodox Jew. When the play opens the son, who has been courting a young Irish Catholic girl, has already married her secretly before a Protestant minister, and concerned about how to soften the blow for his father securing a favorable reception for his bride, while concealing her faith and race. To accomplish this he introduces her to his father as a Jewish girl in whom he is interested and conceals the fact they are married. The girl somewhat reluctantly agrees to the plan; the father takes the bait, becomes infatuated with the girl, insists that they must marry. He assumes they will because it's the father's idea. He calls in a rabbi, and prepares for the wedding according to the Jewish rite. :Meanwhile the girl's father, also a widower who lives in California and is as intense in his own religious antagonism as the Jew, has been called to New York, supposing that his daughter is to marry an Irishman and a Catholic. Accompanied by a priest, he arrives at the house at the moment when the marriage is being celebrated, so too late to prevent it, and the two fathers, each infuriated by the proposed union of his child to a heretic, fall into unseemly and grotesque antics. The priest and the rabbi become friendly, exchange trite sentiments about religion, and agree that the match is good. Apparently out of abundant caution, the priest celebrates the marriage for a third time, while the girl's father is inveigled away. The second act closes with each father, still outraged, seeking to find some way by which the union, thus trebly insured, may be dissolved. :The last act takes place about a year later, the young couple having meanwhile been abjured by each father, and left to their own resources. They have had twins, a boy and a girl, but their fathers know no more than that a child has been born. At Christmas each, led by his craving to see his grandchild, goes separately to the young folks' home, where they encounter each other, each laden with gifts, one for a boy, the other for a girl. After some slapstick comedy, depending upon the insistence of each that he is right about the sex of the grandchild, they become reconciled when they learn the truth, and that each child is to bear the given name of a grandparent. The curtain falls as the fathers are exchanging amenities, and the Jew giving evidence of an abatement in the strictness of his orthodoxy. There have been some variations of the plot, as to setting, or how the characters meet, in later versions of the play or in adaptations for film. Critical response Although the play was a tremendous popular success, it was universally loathed by the critics. Robert Benchley, then the theatre critic for Life magazine, nursed a particular hatred for it. Part of Benchley's job was to write capsule reviews each week. Abie's Irish Rose he described variously as \\"Something Awful\\", \\"Just about as low as good clean fun can get\\", \\"Showing that the Jews and the Irish crack equally old jokes\\", \\"The comic spirit of 1876\\", \\"People laugh at this every night, which explains why democracy can never be a success\\", \\"Will the Marines never come?\\" and finally \\"Hebrews 13:8,\\" a Biblical passage that reads, ‚ÄúJesus Christ, the same yesterday, and today, and forever.‚Äù He also held a contest for an outsider to contribute the capsule review, which Harpo Marx won with \\"No worse than a bad cold.\\"quoted in Malarcher, Jay. \\"No, Siree! A One-Night Stand with the Algonquin Round Table\\" Writing in The New Yorker of its 1937 revival, Wolcott Gibbs said that \\"it had, in fact, the rather eerie quality of a repeated nightmare; the one, perhaps, in which I always find myself in an old well, thick with bats, and can't get out.\\" The Anti-Defamation League protested the use of Jewish stereotypes in the 1946 film version, claiming it \\"will reinforce, if it does not actually create, greater doubt and keener misconceptions, as well as outright prejudice.\\" Reflecting on the play's message of social tolerance, Brooks Atkinson wrote about the 1954 revival, \\"What was a comic strip joke in 1922 is a serious problem today. Every now and then Abie's Irish Rose strikes a sensitive chord. For good will is in shorter supply now than it was thirty-two years ago.\\"Schildcrout, p. 34. Contemporary scholar Jordan Schildcrout reads Abie's Irish Rose in relation to rising anxieties about immigration during the 1920s, as well as to current events such as the establishment of the Irish Free State (1921), the British Mandate for Palestine (1922), and the restrictive Immigration Act of 1924.Schildcrout, pp. 31-32. He writes, \\"In an era when anti-Jewish and anti-Irish sentiments were prominent, the play's representation of ethnic pride might have empowered audiences, while also offering them a happy fantasy of belonging and becoming increasingly 'American,' and therefore not subject to the old prejudices and ethnic rivalries.\\"  Cultural references Lorenz Hart expressed the feeling of many in the theater world in these lines for \\"Manhattan\\": \\"Our future babies we'll take to Abie's Irish Rose -- I hope they'll live to see it close.\\" The play was popular enough for its title to be referenced in a pun in the Marx Brothers film Animal Crackers, in the lyrics of the Cole Porter song \\"Ace in the Hole\\", the Stephen Sondheim song \\"I'm Still Here\\", and the song \\"The Legacy\\" from the musical On the Twentieth Century. Thematic legacy Abie's Irish Rose prefigured the comedy of Stiller and Meara, a husband-and- wife team (Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara), who often spiked their routines with references to their differing backgrounds (Stiller is Jewish; Meara was of an Irish Catholic background but converted to Judaism later during their marriage). The play also provided the central premise for the 1972‚Äì73 television series Bridget Loves Bernie (CBS), which starred Meredith Baxter and David Birney (who later became husband and wife in real life) in a kind-of reversal of Abie's Irish Rose in that Birney played struggling young Jewish cab driver/aspiring playwright Bernie Steinberg, whose parents ran a modest family delicatessen, and Baxter played Irish Catholic daughter of wealthy parents, Bridget Fitzgerald, who falls in love with and elopes with Steinberg to the disappointment of both sets of parents. (Although both actors were Protestant, the casting partially inverted real life, Birney being of Irish descent.) The show was attacked by a broad range of Jewish groups for allegedly promoting inter-faith marriage, and it was cancelled at the end of its first season, despite being the fifth-highest-rated serial of the 1972‚Äì1973 year on USA broadcast television. But two decades later, with social attitudes changing in the US, CBS would run another television series, Brooklyn Bridge (1991‚Äì1993), the quasi-autobiographical childhood memoir of its Jewish series creator, Gary David Goldberg, which featured a continuing romance between two main (teenage) characters, a Jewish boy and an Irish Catholic girl. It ran two seasons, with the sixth (two-part) episode of the first season, titled War of the Worlds, exploring the tensions of this inter- faith relationship in its mid-1950s Brooklyn fictional setting. (Goldberg had previously created another quasi-autobiographical television series, Family Ties, inspired by his adult life, in which the female lead, the alter-ego of his real-life Irish Catholic partner, had been portrayed by Meredith Baxter, the same actress who had starred in the ill-fated Bridget Loves Bernie.)

It was written by Evans and always sung by the duo over the end credits of those programs. Happy Trails was released in 1952 as a 78 RPM and 45 RPM by Rogers and Evans with the Whippoorwills and Orchestra, on RCA Victor Records. It was re-issued in 1957 as a 45 RPM record on RCA Victor/Bluebird. Members of the Western Writers of America chose it as one of the Top 100 Western songs of all time. Foy Willing's version In 1951, Foy Willing had written a song titled \\"Happy Trails\\" for the Republic Pictures movie, Spoilers of the Plains, starring Roy Rogers with Foy Willing and the Riders of the Purple Sage. Subsequently, the first three notes of Foy's song and the title were used by Dale Evans in writing her version of \\"Happy Trails\\" for both the original The Roy Rogers Show and the short-lived The Roy Rogers and Dale Evans Show, which aired on ABC in 1962. Dale's is the version that is popularly played and sung today, albeit without giving credit to Foy Willing. Cover versions  There have been numerous notable covers of Dale Evans' version of the song. For example: * Quicksilver Messenger Service released an album called Happy Trails (1969), on which the song appears. * On October 1, 1970, Janis Joplin left a taped recording of the song as a birthday greeting for John Lennon, three days before her death. Lennon, whose birthday was October 9, later told Dick Cavett that her taped greeting arrived at his home after her death. * Van Halen covered the song as the closing track for their album, Diver Down (1982), and usually the band would end live performances they did with their first lead singer, David Lee Roth, with that song. * Randy Travis covered the song with Rogers on his album, Heroes & Friends (1990).

This article will use cycloalkenes as examples. 1,2-disubstituted Cycloalkene undergoing syn and anti addition Syn addition is the addition of two substituents to the same side (or face) of a double bond or triple bond, resulting in a decrease in bond order but an increase in number of substituents. Generally the substrate will be an alkene or alkyne. An example of syn addition would be the oxidation of an alkene to a diol via a suitable oxidizing agent such as osmium tetroxide, OsO4, or potassium permanganate, KMnO4. Anti addition is in direct contrast to syn addition. In anti addition, two substituents are added to opposite sides (or faces) of a double bond or triple bond, once again resulting in a decrease in bond order and increase in number of substituents. The classical example of this is bromination (any halogenation) of alkenes. Depending on the substrate double bond, addition can have different effects on the molecule. After addition to a straight-chain alkene such as C2H4, the resulting alkane will rapidly and freely rotate around its single sigma bond under normal conditions (i.e. room temperature). Thus whether substituents are added to the same side (syn) or opposite sides (anti) of a double can usually be ignored due to free rotation. However, if chirality or the specific absolute orientation of the substituents needs to be taken into account, knowing the type of addition is significant. Unlike straight-chain alkenes, cycloalkene syn addition allows stable addition of substituents to the same side of the ring, where they remain together. The cyclic locked ring structure prevents free rotation. Syn elimination and anti elimination are the reverse processes of syn and anti addition. These result in a new double bond, such as in Ei elimination.

Origin Lehrer has several possible origins. The first two possible origins are: = Teacher = The most probable option for the origin of the Lehrer surname is from the word Lehrer, meaning teacher or rabbi in the German language. This may be religious or it may describe a teacher in a traditional elementary school. It would depend on the particular circumstances at the time that the surname was given out or adopted. = Locational = The origin may be topographical and derive from the ancient pre-7th-century word lehr akin to the English 'leah', and as such describing an enclosure suitable for agriculture or a water meadow, one which was flooded in winter but dried out for summer grazing. There are several places in Southern Germany and Austria called 'Lehr'. These place names might have derived from old water meadows. Having researched the Lehrer name for many years, the topographical-locational option certainly seems likely for some of the other potential spellings which have been suggested and would be possible for the lineage in southern Germany. This would also fit with what one Lehrer family researcher has noted about the Lehrer name in Dabo, France for the year 1772: ‚ÄúIf this is an occupational name, then this would have been relatively rare as this was at the beginning of the time when surnames were given based on a man's occupation.‚Äù = Jewish Lehrers = There is a well documented family that trace their lineage to a Jewish teacher in Poland. While possible, it appears very unlikely that the southern German and the Jewish family lines are connected. The possible link from the Rhineland Lehrers to the Polish line relates to emigration from France and southern Germany. There was no systematic, official method of emigration, and few emigration lists are available, yet significant numbers of emigrants were known to leave southern Germany and Alsace during the following periods: * 1618 to 1648 and immediately after: The Thirty Years' War created large movements in and around what is today southern Germany. * 1650 to 1750: Large numbers depart central Europe for the new opportunities in America * 1722: Alsatian colonies established in the Holy Roman Empire (Austria- Hungary). * 1764 to 1786: Alsatians colonise Russia, Ukraine, and Banat. * 1789 to 1791: About 500,000 refugees flee the French Revolution for neighbouring nations and the Americas. About half later returned. * 1804 to 1832: Additional Alsatians emigrate to Ukraine, Bessarabia, and Banat. Also the registres d'options de noms 1808 became a de facto census of the Jewish people of France. The numbers are interesting. According to a list in the Archives nationales there were 46,054 Jewish people in France who chose permanent names. The majority were in the departments of Bas-Rhin, Haut-Rhin, and Moselle, areas that some Lehrer families lived in. In each, the head of a family, usually the husband and father, gives for each family member his or her name, date and place of birth, and the surname and forenames chosen. = Germanic Lehrers = There are a number of Lehrer families originating in southern Germany, north, west France, Austria and Bavaria, although unlikely some of these different lineages may all originate from the one family. By following the birth places of the people furthest back in the known Lehrer family lines, as we move further back in time, there is a consistent movement into the Rhineland, in particular to two nearby cities either side of the Rhine, Landau and Strasbourg. The earliest known record of births and marriages for Lehrer families are the children of Georg Lehrer and his wife Sibilla who lived in Bayern, Germany and they had three known children who were all baptised in Evangelisch, Landau in Pfalz Stadt, Pfalz, Bavaria * Christianus Lehrer - Baptised 18 August 1577 * Maria Lehrer - Baptised 2 June 1581 * Margaretha Lehrer ‚Äì Baptised 24 May 1584 Commercial heraldry websites indicate that there is a Lehrer family crest, they do however promote other surnames of a similar spelling as having the same family crest. If there is a Lehrer crest, likely recordings of who this was issued to and where they were from would be in German Bavaria or W√ºrttemberg as during the late 1500s and the early part of the 1600s, almost all recorded Lehrer, birth, death and marriages appear to be located in this region. Moving into the late 1600s and early 1700s the recorded births, deaths and marriages spread out through the Rhineland and include Alsace which was partially independent and is now a part of France, Austria, Wurrtemburg and other parts of Germany. By the late 1700s and early 1800s, a significant number of Lehrers moved elsewhere around the world, specifically to the Americas.

It was approved by referendum on December 14, 1965, and proclaimed by the governor as adopted on December 30. It comprises 14 articles and has been amended 31 times. This constitution replaced the earlier constitution of 1818. It is the state's second constitution since the establishment of the United States. An earlier constitution dating from colonial times, the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut, remained the basis of government even as Connecticut gained its independence from Great Britain, existed as an independent polity, and joined the United States.  Articles  The constitution consists of fourteen articles: # Declaration of Rights ‚Äì Analogous to the United States Bill of Rights, providing rights to speech, assembly, speedy trial, bearing of arms, and religion, among others. # Of the Distribution of Powers ‚Äì Establishes three branches of government in the state: legislative, executive, and judicial. # Of the Legislative Department ‚Äì Creates a two-house legislature, sets standards for districting, elections, and ethics. # Of the Executive Department ‚Äì Sets terms, requirements, and powers of the governor, lieutenant governor, secretary of the state, treasurer and comptroller. # Of the Judicial Department ‚Äì Establishes supreme, superior, and lesser courts, and the rules that govern how judges are chosen. # Of the Qualifications of Electors ‚Äì Lists age and residency requirements for voters. # Of Religion ‚Äì Reiterates the right to free practice of religion. # Of Education ‚Äì Charters a free elementary school school system, the University of Connecticut, and Yale College. # Of Impeachments ‚Äì Sets rules for impeachment and treason trials. # Of Home Rule ‚Äì Gives the general assembly the right to delegate authority to cities and towns. # General Provisions ‚Äì The oath of office, restrictions on salary raises, and other miscellaneous rules. # Of Amendments to the Constitution ‚Äì Establishes the method of amending the state constitution. # Of Constitutional Conventions ‚Äì Creates the method of calling for a special convention to amend or revise the constitution. # Of the Effective Date of This Constitution ‚Äì The constitution became effective after approval by a popular vote and proclamation by the governor.  Amending the constitution  ;Legislature and referendum The Connecticut constitution can be amended via a process that originates in the General Assembly. If a joint resolution proposing a constitutional amendment passes each house of the General Assembly with a three-fourths majority of the votes cast, the amendment is submitted to the voters in the next even-numbered year's general election. If such a joint resolution fails to win a three-fourths majority vote in either house but still obtains a majority, it must receive a majority in each house during the next legislative session before being submitted to the voters in the next even-numbered year's general election. An amendment that wins a majority of the votes cast in the referendum is adopted. ;Constitutional convention A constitutional convention can amend the constitution. Such a convention is called either: * when called for by a two-thirds vote of each house of the General Assembly, provided at least 10 years have passed since a constitutional convention was convened; or * when approved by a majority vote of the electorate, to whom the question \\"Shall there be a Constitutional Convention to amend or revise the Constitution of the State?\\" is submitted whenever 20 years have passed since a constitutional convention was convened and since the question of calling a convention was submitted to the voters.

The document recognized no allegiance to England but instead an independent government. The Charter of the Colony of Connecticut (1662) officially superseded the Fundamental Orders, but the local government continued operating under the previous rules. Even after the American Revolutionary War, the state retained its constitution for another 40 years. The colonial charter was abolished with the adoption of the first state constitution in 1818. In contrast to the Fundamental Orders, that constitution provided for freedom of religion. On October 1, 1901, Connecticut residents voted nearly 2-to-1 in favor of calling of a constitutional convention to revise the constitution. A convention was held, and a revised constitution was proposed. On June 16, 1902, voters rejected the revised constitution by a margin of more than 2-to-1.

According to the , it has a population of people. Cardona is part of the 2nd Congressional District of Rizal. Located about 42 Km east of Manila. With the continuous expansion of Metro Manila, the municipality is now part of Manila's conurbation which reaches Cardona in its easternmost part. In 1855, Cardona became a town with boundaries set in 1857. Later in June 1901, Cardona formed part of the newly- created Province of Rizal through Act 137 promulgated by the Philippine Commission. In 1903, a suceeding Act annexed the town to the Municipality of Morong. Eleven years then, the Executive Order 108 issued by Governor General Francis Burton Harrison has established the town as an independent municipality. Etymology An oral folklore tells how the name ‚ÄúCardona‚Äù was derived from the Spanish word ‚Äúcaldo‚Äù referring to a native rice broth. Supposedly, a stranger walking through the street of the town happened to ask the name of the town from a native, who at that time was enjoying a bowl of hot ‚Äúcaldo‚Äù. Thinking that the stranger was inquiring as to what he was eating, the native answered ‚ÄúSapao! Caldo!‚Äù Another story tells that the town of Cardona in Barcelona Province is believed to be the eponym of the town. Settlements in the area during the Spanish-era were on the hills and the place surrounded by waters of the Laguna Lake. Early missionary Franciscan friars have seen its resemblance to the Spanish town which is also located on a hill and is almost surrounded by the waters of the river Cardener. Parts of the present-day Barangays Calahan, Patunhay, Del Remedio, Iglesia, San Roque, Dalig, and Looc are set on these hills. Barangays Cardona is politically subdivided into 18 barangays, 11 of which are on the mainland and 7 on Talim Island.

According to the , it has a population of people. Etymology What is now the town's Barangay Punta was the seat of an earlier settlement later known as Hala√°n. During the summer from April to May, the shores of Laguna de Bay along Punta would be filled with small shellfish locally known as hala√°n. As is typical with many modern Philippine toponyms, the town's name supposedly resulted from miscommunication between early Spanish visitors and natives. The Spaniards enquired of some natives along the shoreline, \\"¬øComo se llama este sitio?\\" (\\"What is the name of this place?\\") to which the latter replied, \\"hala√°n p√≤,\\" thinking that the foreigners referred to the shells. The Spaniards accepted the response as the name of the place, and began calling it hala√°n, later corrupting it into Jalajala. Another folk etymology is that Jalajala stems from an endemic breed of boar called berk jala, which is abundant in the wilds around the town and is depicted on its seal. As with the other story, a Spaniard asked the Tagalog-speaking natives the place's name, and the locals' interjection of \\"hala-hala‚Äù (possibly a hunting chant) was taken by the Spaniards to be their answer. Geography Jalajala is on a peninsula located southeast of Manila in the largest freshwater lake in the Philippines, Laguna de Bay. It lies on the eastern part of the Rizal Province and has a land area of 4,930.000 hectares representing 3.77% of the total land area of the province. Jalajala‚Äôs political boundary on the north is the Panguil River, wherein it shares the boundary with the town of Pakil in Laguna. On its southern, eastern, and western boundaries lies the Laguna de Bay. Mount Sembrano forms the boundary of Jalajala and Pililla. =Barangays= Jala-jala, Rizal political map (subject to correction) Jalajala is politically subdivided into eleven barangays (three urban, eight rural).

According to the , it has a population of people. A popular attraction is Spanish-era St. Jerome's Parish Church. The town is also known for featuring the balaw-balaw side dish, as well as for having education as its priority- \\"Una Ang Edukasyon\\" (Education first), that is why during the early-1970s and early-1990s, it became the center of education. Students from different places mostly in the nearby towns of Rizal would come and study in Morong. History Morong was considered the province before it was called Rizal. Its original name was Politico Militar Distrito de Morong, which included the towns that make up present-day Rizal province. =Discovery, Founding and Christianization= On January 16, 1572, Captain Juan Maldonado, a trusted officer under Martin de Goiti, a Deputy of Miguel Lopez de Legaspi, came to a thriving community by a river while leading a Spanish contingent exploring the areas East of Manila. They named the community, Moron, after a township in Spain. This happened almost a year after Martin De Goit occupied Manila after routing the forces of Rajah Soliman (Sulayman). The Spaniards found an organized community along both banks of the river but outlying settlements / barangays were in conflict with each other. The barangays were subjugated and the natives Christianized starting 1578 by Franciscan missionaries Juan de Placencia and Diego de Oropesa. They constructed chapels (visitas) attached to a bigger settlement to allow religious and civil administration. Later, this settlement was converted into a pueblo. which they called Pueblo de Moron. Baras, Tanay, Pililla, Binangonan were the visitas under Pueblo de Morong. Pueblo de Morong was made the provincial capital of the Franciscan Order at that time. The visita of Pilang separated from Morong and became the independent town of Pililla. Binangonan followed in 1621. =Politico-Militar Distrito de Morong= The Politico-Militar Distrito de Morong or Distrito de Morong was created out of the provinces of Manila and Laguna composing the pueblos of Morong, Pililla, Tanay, Baras, Binangonan, Jalajala, Angono, Antipolo, Boso-Boso, Cainta and Taytay. During the Spanish colonization in the Philippines, each town (pueblo) was admistered by a gobernadorcillo, elected annually by all natives of the locality, subject to the approval of the suerior government in located in Manila. In the 19th century, gobernadorcillos were elected by 12 cabezas de barangay. In the pueblo of Morong, it was different. A gobernadorcillo was not elected but was appointed by the governor of the province based on his economic wealth, training and educational background. He chose his own people and were not elected to help him with his duties. They did not receive salary but were exempted from paying taxes and doing forced labor. =Public Works Built Under Forced Labor= Puente de San Geronimo Morong Church and bridge The original Bridge of Morong was made of adobe stones, shaped and placed together, forming an arch over the river. The strength and stability of the bridge came from the weight of its wedge-shaped stone blocks and its upright position. The stones were cemented with mortar, a mixture of fine sand, lime, molasses and juice of ground puso-puso leaves. Heavy piers of the arch were planted on the opposite banks of the river. No metals were used during its construction from 1696 to 1701. St. Jerome Parish Church This church was constructed not only by men, but also women and children. Stones dug from a hill called Kay Ngaya; lime from the stones of the mountain Kay Maputi; sand and gravel from Morong River; and timber were contributed by the townspeople. Irrigation Works In 1850, Fr. Maximo Rico drew the plan of the irrigation dam at Uugong where it drew water from the falls and supervised the construction of the irrigation canal from Uugong dam to the ricefield in San Pedro. The canal measured 501 meters long and 2.1 meters deep. Other sources say that the construction started by Franciscan priests in 1848. Comandancia La Commandancia During the period of Spanish colonization, this building housed the Comandacia del Distrito Politico- Militar de Morong, the seat of Government for the Distrito. It was originall made of adobe stones, hard wood and galvanized iron sheets for roofing. During the early American period, it was converted into a school. It was damaged after the second world war, but rebuilt with alterations and continued to be used as a primary school building. It was later torn down and rebuilt using reinforced concrete materials and used as the municipal office building for the government of Morong. In 2011, the local government offices were transferred to the new municipal building in a different location. The Comandancia's second floor has since been converted into a public museum. Bantayan and Torrita Bantayan was a small guardhouse where civil guards were stationed at the entrance of the town. On the other hand, a torrita was a small tower with bells that provided the signal directed to the central station in front of the Commandancia. =World War I= Tomas Claudio Monument The first Filipino to die in World War I was Private Tomas Mateo Claudio, who served with the U.S. Marine Corps as part of the American Expeditionary Forces to Europe. He died in the Battle of Ch√¢teau Thierry in France on June 29, 1918. The Tomas Claudio Memorial College in Morong, which was founded in 1950, was named in his honor. The main street of the town was also named in his honor. =World War II= The Puente de San Geronimo (old Morong Bridge) was intentionally blasted by the guerrillas so that Japanese troops could not cross and occupy the Northern part of Morong and Rizal until reinforcements could come. The plan worked for a few days but Japanese troops were eventually able to cross the river at a shallower part farther downriver. The Japanese occupation of the town was broken up by then-Lieutenant Edwin Ramsey, leading the last cavalry charge in U.S. military history with horses from the 26th Cavalry Regiment which he and a platoon of Philippine Scouts had ridden there from Fort Stotsenburg. During the Liberation, Filipino troops of the 4th and 42nd Infantry Division of the Philippine Army and 4th Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary including the recognized guerrillas of the Col. Markings Guerrillas and the Hunters ROTC guerrillas liberated and captured the towns in Morong, defeated Japanese forces and forced them to surrender by the end of the War.

The real purpose used to be for the veneration of the Virgin Mary. Girls from Morong, ages 6‚Äì30, would offer flowers and prayers to the blessed Mother. Girls included in this procession would also bring the seven alays for the Blessed Mother such as: Rosa Mystica, Torre ni David, Crown of Mary, Gates of Heaven etc. This tradition is attempted to be revived again by the Catholic Church in the year 2007 through voting, but comments such as the main purpose of it might again not be done and the fashion show and showing off would once again reign, the church decided to just make it a simple celebration, by doing a rosary and offering flowers to the Virgin Mother. * Malatines - Is a Christmas Eve mass or usually called MISA- de Gallo by other places. December 24. Usually celebrated outside the church Patio. The much awaited scenario in the mass is the dancing of the star.

As the couple approach each table, visitors would put their donation and sip a shot of whisky or wine as a \\"Thank you\\".

Another tradition during weddings would be the \\"hatiran\\" or wherein the bride accompanied by her parents would now transfer house. Its like a formal farewell of the bride to her house as she will transfer to the grooms house. What's exciting in this tradition is that each lightpost/ electric post that the couple would pass through going to the grooms house, the newly weds would kiss each other.

According to the , it has a population of people. It is surrounded by farms, small mountains, plains, and trees. Pililla is known as the Green Field Municipality of Rizal. Pililla has preserved some religious and non-religious traditions such as the Santa Cruzan or Flores de Mayo, wherein men and women walk all over town with their gowns. Town Fiesta during the month of July is being visited by people from the city to experience the celebrations especially the amateur shows at night. Like other towns, Pililla holds basketball league competitions for youth during summer. Pililla is also a destination for road cyclists because of its asphalted road, specifically in Sitio Bugarin in Barangay Halayhayin. History Pililla Municipal Hall Pilang Munti (Pililla's pre-Hispanic name) was ruled by a leader named Salyan Maginto. His territory encompasses the modern-day jurisdiction of the municipalities of Baras, Tanay, Pililla, and Jalajala. It was referenced as ‚Äúmunti‚Äù in contrast to the nearby and much larger town of Pila in the province of Laguna. Cavada, a Spanish historian, revealed that in the year 1571, the Spanish forces conquered the towns along Laguna de Bay which they called ‚ÄúRinconada de Moron‚Äù and Pilang Munti was among these which surrendered to the superior force of the Spaniards. Pilang Munti was incorporated into the colonial administration of Morong, and thus, the town was called \\"Pilang Morong\\". In 1572, the first Spanish missionary priests arrived at Pilang Morong. Since then, Christianity was spread by the Spanish priests and in 1582, Fr. Juan de Placencia and Fr. Diego de Oropesa established a ‚Äúvisita‚Äù barrio at Pilang Morong. The place was divided by the Spaniards into 5 ‚Äúrancherias‚Äù: * Monte Tan-ay * Sitio Tigbi (Lulukong) * San Diego * Monte Yakat * Dolo Rio (Wawa) In 1583, Pilang Morong became an independent municipality. ‚ÄùPililla‚Äù was given as the official name of the newly formed town. The name ‚ÄúPililla‚Äù arose from the diminutive rules in the Castillan language by modifying a name with ‚Äú-illa‚Äù or ‚Äú-illo‚Äù to indicate a smaller or younger version. In 1599, 16 years after the town was given autonomy, the supreme government granted Pililla the authority to construct a church. In 1600, the first church of cogon and bamboo was constructed in the Dolo Rio but this was burned and a church made of wood was constructed but this was also burned down with the whole town in 1632. Another church made of wood was built and this suffered the same fate in 1668. Two years later, the construction of the present church began. This was finished in 1673 and the edifice still stands up to the present. As an autonomous town, Pililla encompassed several barrios including Tanay and Jalajala. Tanay separated from Pililla and became an independent town in 1606. Jalajala became a barrio of Pililla in 1676 but was separated and made an independent town in 1786. It was reincorporated as a barrio of Pililla in 1816, but 9 years later, it was once again separated from Pililla to become an independent municipality. On December 4, 1837, an election of local officials was held in Pililla. The following towns participated in the said election: Morong, Pililla, Tanay, Baras, Jalajala and San Diego. The last town was a new town and is presumed to be either the barrio of Quisao, which has San Diego as its patron, or the barrio of Niogan. In 1853, Pililla was separated from the province of Laguna to be incorporated into the newly created Distrito de los Montes de San Mateo. In 1857, it was given the new name Distrito Politico-Militar de Morong. On March 10, 1861, two principales of San Diego presented to the government a request, on behalf of the residents of San Diego and the sitios of Mavia and Puang, that their territory be separated from Pililla and to create an independent town to be called Perez. Both the gobernadorcillo and the parish priest, as well as the gobernador politico-militar de Morong, favored the petition. However, it was disapproved by the Administracion Civil since the territory did not meet the pre-requisite of having at least 500 tributes, the said territory was having only 298 tributes at that time. On July 9, 1885, the government received another petition from Cabeza de Barangay of San Diego requesting that it be made into a kind of self-governing barrio of Pililla, on account of its remoteness. On January 25, 1886, the government agreed to make San Diego into a ‚ÄúVisita con Teniente Absolute‚Äù, on condition that the barrio constructs the necessary public buildings. Thus, upon the fulfillment of the agreed condition, the government's approval went into effect on June 18 of that same year. In 1896, the Katipuneros of Pililla and San Diego established their military camp at Rambo or Pabalang na Gubat. Three years later, on August 6, 1898, Pililla was incorporated in the revolutionary government of Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo. During the existence of the Philippine Republic, San Diego became an independent town. On January 5, 1899, a fierce battle ensued between the American forces and the Filipino troops defending Pililla. The town was partially ravaged by fire and local troops had to retreat to the mountain of Tanay. The towns of Pililla and San Diego were integrated into the newly created province of Rizal in June 1901. Two years later, the Philippine Commission, in line with its policy of economy and centralization, consolidated the towns of Pililla, San Diego and Jalajala with the seat of government in Pililla. The first Capitan under the American regime was Regino Quitiong who was the alcalde from 1900 to 1901. On September 20, 1907, Jalajala was separated from Pililla and became an independent municipality. Quisao, on the other hand, remained a barrio of Pililla up to the present. In 1918, the population of Pililla was 2,776 and Quisao was 814. In 1929, the place called Longos within the jurisdiction of Pililla was cleared by the majority of the tenant population of the town of Jalajala who transferred their homes to this site and whereon they founded a new community, thus avoiding their agrarian conflict with the plantation owner of Jalajala. On September 24, 1929, Don Ananias Vicencio, a philanthropist in public documents, donated a tract of land containing approximately 15 hectares to the families of Manuel Roxas, Leoncio Carungay and Quintin Golliden, all of Jalajala, who shall distribute and assign free of charge and to the best interest of the residents, the said lot at Longos, Barrio Quisao, Municipality of Pililla. In 1939, this land was surveyed by Engr. Quintin Gollidon who provided the layout of this new community now called Barrio Malaya. On December 13, 1942, the town of Quisao was attacked and pillaged by \\"tulisanes\\". During the liberation of the town on March 18, 1945, nearly 3/4 of all the houses and public buildings were either burned or destroyed by American and Filipino military bombing and shelling. The Japanese forces and Makapili fled to the mountains following the liberation of the town. The PCAU of the US Army reestablished the municipal government of Pililla on April 20, 1945 with the designation of Lucio Aquino, an active guerrilla leader, as the mayor.

It can also remove a General who can no longer fulfill their duties. It is made up of the Chief of the Staff, all active Commissioners except the spouse of the General, and all active Territorial Commanders. It is not a governing body of the Salvation Army, and is regarded as having no continuity of existence between meetings. History The High Council was established by William Booth in 1904. Its purpose was to remove and replace a General who could no longer fulfill the duties of office for reasons of either ill health or general 'unfitness'.Kirkham, J.C.: \\"Deposed but not Despised\\", page 9. Published privately by the author, 1999 The Chief of the Staff could summon the Commissioners to vote on the issue, and if they found that the General was not capable of performing the role they would choose a successor. It was intended that in normal circumstances the choice of a successor would be made by the outgoing General. This happened only with the second General of The Salvation Army, Bramwell Booth, who succeeded William Booth upon his death in 1912. In November 1928, Bramwell Booth was away from International Headquarters for several months due to illness. He was asked to resign, but refused. On 8 January 1929, the High Council met for the first time and voted 55 to 8 to remove the 73-year-old ill General. General Booth took his case to court, and this lost him a great deal of respect. The Proceedings were delayed by the death of Lieut-Commissioner William J. Haines, Vice-President of the High Council, who collapsed during a High Council meeting and died 45 minutes later. After over two months of deliberations, the court ruled in favour of the High Council. The High Council met on 13 February 1929, and elected General Booth's Chief of the Staff Edward Higgins as the new General of The Salvation Army. In 1931 the Salvation Army Act of the British Parliament was passed, with the support of General Higgins. The effects of this were that the General lost the power to choose a successor, fixed an age limit of 70 for the retirement of the General, and created a trustee company to hold the properties and other capital assets of The Salvation Army instead of the sole trusteeship of the General. The most complete history of this time period of The Salvation Army has now been compiled in \\"1929, A Crisis That Shaped The Salvation Army's Future\\" by retired General John Larsson. High Councils to elect a new general have been held in 1934, 1939, 1946, 1954, 1963, 1969, 1974, 1977, 1981, 1986, 1993, 1994, 1999, 2002, 2006, 2011 and 2013. British law requires that the High Council meets in the United Kingdom, although it does not specify where.http://www.salvationarmy.org/ihq/news/inf260713 Who can be a General? The High Council established by William Booth in 1904 provided that ‚Äòthe person so to be elected may be either one of the members of the High Council or some other person‚ÄôHow a High Council works Since 1980 nominees must be Salvation Army officers. To date, no General has ever been elected without being a member of the High Council. A woman has been elected as General on three occasions. Election of a general =Preliminaries= The High Council will first elect a president to preside over the council. After electing a president to guide its deliberations, the first task will be to establish the way it will work. The council will review the Orders of Procedure used by the previous High Councils, which distils in to some 70 numbered paragraphs the accrued experience of all past councils. After reviewing the document and making any amendments it feels necessary, the High Council will formally adopt the revised version as its own Orders of Procedure. A High Council is an exercise of spiritual discernment, and time is therefore set aside for worship, reflection and prayer. The collective prayer of the members will be that at the end of the process they might be able to echo the words of the Council of Jerusalem: ‚ÄòIt seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us‚Ä¶‚Äô (Acts 15:28). Time is also set aside for discussions about the challenges and opportunities that the Army faces around the world. Clarifying the issues the next General will have to grapple with helps to clarify the kind of leader the Army needs. =Nominees= The High Council then moves to the nomination stage. Every member has the privilege of nominating someone to be a candidate for general. The only criteria laid down are that the person nominated must be an Officer in The Salvation Army and be under 70 years old. The Salvation Army has about 17,000 officers, which means 17,000 persons are eligible to be nominated. But on past precedent the forthcoming High Council is likely to nominate persons from within its own membership. Only those who are nominated by three or more members are deemed to have been nominated. Those who accept nomination become candidates ‚Äì and it is from this panel of candidates that the High Council will be called to elect the next General. At this stage, the High Council adjourns for a full day to enable the candidates and their spouses to prepare written answers to the questions that the Council has prepared. Candidates also work on speeches to present. =Questions and speeches= When the Council begins its deliberations again, candidates and spouses of the candidates read out their answers to the questions. Through the process of questions and answers, the High Council seeks to get to know the candidates at greater depth and to learn more about their leadership style, their personalities and their views on subjects related to the Army and its ministry. Each candidate then gives a speech. No parameters regarding subject matter or length are laid down but speeches usually deal with the candidate‚Äôs vision for the Salvation Army if elected General. =Election= After the questions and speeches, the election itself begins. Each member in turn receives a voting paper from the President and in a secluded area places a tick/check against one of the names on the paper before putting it in a ballot box. The process is unhurried and can take up to an hour for each ballot. After the voting has been completed the tellers count the votes. The Salvation Army Act 1980 ‚Äì by which the High Council is governed ‚Äì stipulates #that in the first three ballots a candidate must get the vote of more than two-thirds of the members present to be elected #that from the fourth ballot onwards a candidate need only receive the votes of more than half the members present #that the candidate who gets the fewest votes in each ballot must drop out until only two candidates remain. The balloting continues until one of the candidates reaches the required number of votes. https://s3.amazonaws.com/cache.salvationarmy.org/f71ade2f-b30f-4554-972a-d2d85b5efcf9_High+Council+feature+-+John+Larrsson.pdf High Council of The Salvation Army, 2006 General John Larsson was due to retire at midnight on 1 April 2006.

The game is the first installment in the Destroy All Humans! franchise, and is set in 1959 in the United States, and parodies the lifestyles, pop culture, and political attitudes of this time period. The player controls Cryptosporidium 137 (a reference to the protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium), a member of the fictional Furon race of alien life, who has come to Earth to harvest DNA from humans to continue the cloning process of his species. Destroy All Humans! received a generally mixed to positive reception by critics. A full remake of the game was released on July 28, 2020. Plot The game begins with a Furon, Cryptosporidium-136, hovering over a launch site with military personnel testing a rocket. The rocket is launched and destroys the ship carrying Crypto-136, and leaves him fatally wounded. Crypto-136 is later captured by the U.S. Army. Some time later, Cryptosporidium-137 travels to Earth with another Furon, Orthopox-13. Cryptosporidium (nicknamed 'Crypto') comes with the intention of rescuing 136, while Orthopox (nicknamed \\"Pox\\") desires to extract human brain stems for study. Crypto arrives at Turnipseed Farm in the Southern United States, where Pox mistakes cows for Earth's dominant life- form. The Majestic agency is alerted to the Furon presence when Crypto decimates an army brigade passing through the area. Pox, communicating with Crypto through a hologram-like device, then reveals to Crypto that the reason he requires human brain stems is because they contain pure Furon D.N.A. handed down to them by Furon scouts eons ago when the Furons stopped on Earth for \\"shore leave\\" following a war with Mars, which was rendered uninhabitable by the Furon Empire. Crypto using telekinesis on a police vehicle After several missions in the Midwestern town of Rockwell and the California suburb of Santa Modesta, Crypto and Pox become aware of the Majestic, and begin crippling government attempts to stop them by performing acts such as destroying Area 42 with an atomic bomb and defeating his recurring foe, Armquist, the head of the army. Throughout the game, Crypto's various acts are covered up by the government and media, which attribute them either to freak accidents or to Communism. After being temporarily captured in Union Town, the game climaxes in Capitol City, where Crypto assassinates President Huffman and brutally slaughters all members of Congress. Soon, the U.S. government seemingly surrenders to the Furons. Crypto meets Silhouette, leader of Majestic, in front of the Capitol. After a brief scuffle with Silhouette, Crypto discovers that \\"he\\" is a woman. Silhouette unveils the Roboprez, which is a towering mech controlled by President Huffman's brain. Crypto defeats Roboprez in his flying saucer, and then defeats Silhouette in a final battle at the Octagon. As Silhouette dies, she reveals that there are other Majestic divisions all over the world. Crypto, however, is confident that without Silhouette's leadership, Majestic will be totally powerless to resist the Furon takeover. The game ends with Huffman making a televised speech, assuring America that the recent events were the work of communists, who have poisoned the U.S. water supply, and that as a result testing centers have been set up all across the country to scan people for harmful toxins. People are then shown being herded reluctantly by Army soldiers into strange machines, apparently for brain stem extraction. Huffman is then revealed to be Crypto in disguise. =Characters= Furons: Coming from the planet Furon, mistaken for Gorta in 'Destroy All Humans!' by the Majestic, in the Proxima Centauri system. Pox corrects the planet's name in 'Destroy All Humans! Path of the Furon'. The Furons are aliens that have a similar appearance to the Greys, aside from having mouths full of sharp teeth. Furons are named after diseases (such as Orthopox and Cryptosporidium), and are a highly advanced race who use their technology for harsh, unsympathetic science and vicious war. Unregulated atomic weaponry caused a fatal mutation in the Furon race whereby they could no longer reproduce due to their lack of genitalia. Using their advanced biotechnology, they began cloning themselves, rendering each Furon virtually immortal, memories and personality being technologically transferred to each new clone. However, with each new clone errors appeared in the genetic material, leading to unpredictable results. Without an infusion of uncorrupted Furon D.N.A., they will clone themselves into extinction. =Setting= Destroy All Humans! is set in the United States in the year 1959 and consists of six settings; Turnipseed Farm (a Southern farm community, in Tennessee), Rockwell (a Nebraska town), Santa Modesta (a parody of Santa Monica), Area 42 (a parody of Area 51 but based in New Mexico instead), Union Town (an Eastern seaboard industrial city) and Capitol City (a parody of Washington, D.C.). All buildings and structures in these environments can be destroyed (save for trees and rocks), and humans can become alarmed by Crypto's presence at these locations. While some run or hide, others are armed and fight back. An alert system, much like Grand Theft Auto's \\"wanted level\\" denotes how much attention Crypto has attracted. Depending on the alert level, police, military, and eventually the Majestic will attempt to defend civilians from Crypto. Neutral NPC's frequently refer to pop culture of the late 1950s such as the Edsel, Marilyn Monroe and 'Ike' Dwight D. Eisenhower when scanned by crypto. In keeping with the cold war setting, hostile NPC's refer to crypto as a 'commie' with his various actions covered up in news stories as communist attacks. Military technology in the game is depicted as being far more advanced than it actually was in the 1950s, with the US Army having possession of sentry guns, automated anti-air batteries, gigantic, ultra-radioactive tesla coils, and mechanized walkers. The Majestic group also seems to be equipped with energy weapons, reverse-engineered Furon technology. The hub of the game is the Furon mothership in orbit around Earth, which vaguely resembles the Alien mothership from Close Encounters of the Third Kind. From there players can receive missions, upgrade weapons, and view unlocked content. This is also the portal to each of the game's Earth settings. Gameplay In Destroy All Humans!, players assume the role of Cryptosporidium 137 (Crypto for short), a warrior and member of the Furons‚Äîa race of war-like extraterrestrials with a large empire constantly seizing new worlds through conquest. After centuries of warfare against inferior species using unchecked nuclear weaponry left their species impotent and without genitalia, the Furons were unable to sexually reproduce and became forced to turn to cloning as a means of reproduction, as well as a process by which to achieve immortality. However, after generations of clones, the Furon DNA is degrading, and each clone is becoming less and less stable. Fortunately for the Furons, one of their scout ships came across Earth many millennia ago while returning from the conquest of Mars. The Furon space travelers impregnated the \\"nubile\\" ancestors of the human race to \\"let off a little steam\\", inserting a strand of Furon DNA into the human gene pool. Because of this, each human contains a small amount of Furon DNA in their genetic code. Crypto is sent to Earth to harvest this DNA from human brain stems, locate and rescue his previous clone, Cryptosporidium-136, and spearhead a Furon invasion of Earth. The game is set up in a sandbox fashion. The player has a selection of weapons and mental abilities at their disposal, as well as access to Crypto's flying saucer. Destroy All Humans! implements the Havok physics engine, allowing for ragdoll effects on bodies and destructible environments. =Weapons and abilities= Crypto destroys a department store in his saucer Crypto possesses advanced Furon weaponry in both his flying saucer and on his person. The saucer is equipped with a Death Ray which can burn humans, vehicles, and buildings; the \\"Abducto Beam\\", a tractor ray that can lift up people and objects and hurl them into the air; the Quantum Deconstructor; a highly powerful nuclear weapon that can launch radioactive bombs that utterly destroy everything in its radius; and the \\"Sonic Boom\\", a bomb that can explode on contact and shock the blast radius like a tremor. On foot Crypto has an arsenal of four weapons, of which include the Zap-O-Matic, a gun that emits an electric charge, shocking its victims; the Anal Probe, a powerful rod that goes into the victim's rectum and uproots a DNA-enriched brain: the Disintegrator Ray, which turns the target's flesh and organs into ashes and renders only a charred skeleton; and the Ion Detonator, the Furon equivalent of a grenade launcher. He also is equipped with an upgradable jet pack to help him traverse long distances. The Furons have a psychokinetic ability nicknamed HoloBob to imitate the appearance of any nearby human. This allows a Furon to travel amongst humans unnoticed. The HoloBob requires PSI energy, called \\"concentration\\" in the game, which can be continually replenished by reading the thoughts of unknowing humans or other animals. This disguise is not without flaw, as the Majestic have the ability to see through and destroy the disguise. Crypto will flash red when near a Majestic agent; if he comes too close, the disguise will vanish. Additionally, he is able to use an ability known as PK or PsychoKinesis that allows one to psychokinetically move objects around. Development The game was conceived of by Matt Harding while he was working at Pandemic Studios, as after Microsoft rejected the more family-friendly game concept Oddballs, he jokingly suggested \\"a game where you kill everyone\\", suggesting the title Destroy All Humans. Being a science fiction fan, Harding even thought of using the concept of playing as an alien invader, something that he had not seen in a video game and served as a \\"premise for getting to do mindless destruction that makes sense.‚Äù Harding never worked on the game, feeling he lacked the ‚Äúenergy or interest‚Äù to \\"spend two years of [his] life writing a game about killing everyone\\". He even contested why along with the on-foot action resembling Grand Theft Auto, there were flying saucer missions - \\"If you‚Äôve got a spaceship, why would you ever get out?\\" - but pushed for a satirical game, something the rest of Pandemic embraced by taking the game on a comedic approach. Harding left soon after on his Asian walkabout, and began recording some of the footage that eventually became the \\"Where The Hell Is Matt?\\" videos.'Destroy All Humans!' Slayed Xenophobes Pre-Trump The game also sponsored ECW One Night Stand (2005). Reception Destroy All Humans! received \\"generally positive\\" and \\"mixed or average\\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. GameZone enjoyed the depth of destruction: \\"the levels themselves have the potential for a lot of damage\\". IGN praised the presentation of the game, stating \\"Phenomenal. Good behind the scenes extras. Great cutscenes. Excellent layout. Really, nicely done,\\" but they thought the game could use a more in-depth stealth aspect: \\"As it happens, not developing stealth to its fullest potential turns out to be one part of a greater underlying problem with Destroy All Humans.\\" TeamXbox cited excellent graphics, saying that \\"Destroy All Humans! is delightful to gaze at.\\" Maxim gave it a score of eight out of ten and said, \\"Set up like Grand Theft Alien, there are tons of missions to complete, though you can also just roam around, killing filthy humans and destroying their stuff.\\" The Sydney Morning Herald gave it four stars out of five and said, \\"The freedom to create chaos is terrific but some missions lack variety.\\" The New York Times also gave it a favorable review, but commented that \\"It's a shame the gameplay lacks the almost flawless perfection of Destroy All Humans' story and presentation.\\" Detroit Free Press gave it three stars out of four, calling it \\"Goofy fun, and that makes up for a lot of its failings. But I couldn't quite forgive the occasional tedium and fairly short length enough to give it a better rating.\\" The game sold more than 1 million copies by March 2006. Legacy Due to the game's success several sequels have been made: Destroy All Humans! 2, which takes place in the 1960s and marks the first time Crypto invades across the globe, Destroy All Humans! Big Willy Unleashed, a spinoff set in the 1970s in which Pox and Crypto run a fast-food chain, and Destroy All Humans! Path of the Furon, which also takes place in the 1970s and begins with Crypto and Pox running a lucrative gambling casino called the \\"Space Dust\\". On October 26, 2005, THQ announced that Fox Broadcasting has purchased the rights to the game and is planning a computer-animated comedy, based on the game, to air in prime time. Jim Dauterive, previously of King of the Hill, will be a writer and executive producer of the TV version of Destroy All Humans! As of 2015, nothing has been unveiled. The show is also referenced in Destroy All Humans! 2, in the Salad Days bonus video, in which Pox and Crypto reminisce on the past game, and talk about the possibilities of the game's future. On June 7, 2019, THQ Nordic announced a remake of Destroy All Humans!, set for a release in 2020 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. The remake was in development at Black Forest Games and featured content that was cut from the original release. The remake is built in Unreal Engine 4.

Built in 1900-1901 by noted pub architects partnership James and Lister Lea for Mitchells & Butlers, it is a grade II* listed building, and is on the Campaign for Real Ale's National Inventory of Historic Pub Interiors. The pub is known for its wall-to-wall Minton-Hollins tiles and its snob screens, which allowed middle class drinkers to see working class drinkers in an adjacent bar, but not to be seen by them. The current public bar was originally divided into three. There are function rooms upstairs, originally for billiards and club use. Laurel and Hardy stayed there in May 1954, while appearing at the adjacent Aston Hippodrome (now demolished, replaced by The Drum Arts Centre), and were photographed serving beer from behind the bar. The pub features in the 1999 Atom Egoyan Birmingham- set film Felicia's Journey. It also features in the 2006 novel by Ron Dawson, The Last Viking: The Untold Story of the World's Greatest Heist; as the gang of robbers meet in the pub. It was purchased in 2002 by Oakham Ales who restored the building to its former greatness before reopening it in 2003, after three years out-of-use. On 28 July 2006, the pub was damaged by fire, reportedly caused by an electrical fault.Fire damages Victorian building - BBC News During the 2011 England riots, the pub was looted, windows were smashed, and fires started, albeit quickly doused by the manager, Wichai Thumjaron.

Its half-length construction make it especially well suited to low pitches, economical as well, and the name is derived from the French word for 'bumblebee' or 'buzz'.  Description  This stop is most commonly found in the manuals and the pedal at 16‚Ä≤ pitch. In lower registers it provides foundation but does not provide much pitch definition. It is also found in the pedal division at 32‚Ä≤ pitch, where its roll of sound can actually shake the building it is installed in. When installed in the pedal division, it is often known as Subbass or Soubasse (Fr.). The Bourdon is also frequently found at 8‚Ä≤, especially in French organs, and is equivalent to the German Gedackt and English Stopped Diapason, which give a similar sound. Although varying between builders, the Bourdon stop is usually fairly soft and neutral, but colorful in the tenor/alto register. The pipes can be built of wood or metal, but are overwhelmingly constructed of wood in modern organ building (French makers from Cavaill√©-coll on prefer metal). They are thick walled, and generally square in cross section, with a high mouth cut-up to produce the fluty tone. Bourdon is a stopped pipe, having an airtight stopper fitted into the top. This makes the tone one octave lower than a pipe of open construction (they are only one half the length of an open pipe of the same pitch), and also eliminates the development of even-numbered harmonics (\\"squaring off\\" the timbre), helping to create the characteristic tone quality. This stop is very common in church organs and indeed theatre organs. In an organ so small as to have only one 16‚Ä≤ stop in the pedal division, it will almost invariably be a bourdon, as the unassertive tone works well under soft or loud combinations, and blends well with all sounds of the organ.  Spelling  'Bourdon' has many spellings and German organ builders will often use \\"Bordun\\", or even \\"Untersatz\\" (typically when it is in the pedals) on the stop knob for this rank. \\"Subbass\\" was originally a stop of somewhat different design than the Bourdon, but the word is accepted today as a synonym for a Bourdon in the pedals. The Italian spelling is \\"Bordone\\".

See also: trance music. B : Bass house is a style of house that appeared in the early-mid 2010s. The genre combines elements of deep house, Dubstep, and UK bass, and often plays with heavy distortion. Early bass house filled the entire frequency spectrum, during the drop, with a single bass pattern; however, more recently, many bass house producers have found inspiration from other sub-genres of house, particularly tech-house, and separated the bass pattern from the melody, notably Tchami, Joyryde, Habstrakt, Jace Mek, Loopers, Jauz, ID46, MEKII, Badjokes, and LOUD ABOUT US! The tempo is most often set around 128 BPM. : Also known as Balearic house, initially was an eclectic blend of DJ-led dance music that emerged in the mid-1980s. It later became the name of a more specific style of electronic dance music that was popular into the mid-1990s. Balearic beat was named for its popularity among European nightclub and beach rave patrons on the Balearic island of Ibiza, a popular tourist destination. Some dance music compilations referred to it as \\"the sound of Ibiza\\", even though many other, more aggressive and upbeat forms of dance music could be heard on the island. : Baltimore club is a style of house music closely related to the \\"booty bass\\" of ghetto house and Miami bass. It is characterized by a heavy use of looped vocal samples similar to ghetto house but with breakbeat drum patterns at around 130 BPM. These samples are often of popular hip hop and contemporary R&B; songs or of pop culture references such as themes from television shows.

Inspired by the '70s and '80s funk and disco sounds. Mostly features a typical sound \\"filter\\" effect and lower BPM. : The genre evolved from the earlier, rapid rhythms of juke and ghetto house. It may draw from styles such as drum and bass, utilizing double-time clave triplets, syncopated toms and prominent sub-bass. : Funky house as it sounds today first started to develop during the late 1990s. It can again be sub- divided into many other types of house music. French house, Italian house, disco house, Latin house and many other types of house have all contributed greatly to what is today known as funky house. It is recognizable by its often very catchy bassline, swooshes, swirls and other synthesized sounds which give the music a bouncy tempo.

G :One of the first house genres with origins set in New York and New Jersey. It was named after the Paradise Garage nightclub in New York that operated from 1977 to 1987 under the influential resident DJ Larry Levan. Garage house developed alongside Chicago house and the result was house music sharing its similarities, influencing each other. Garage house is generally piano oriented, a sound deriving from soul and disco, with a heavy emphasis on vocals, preferably female. One contrast from Chicago house was that the vocals in garage house drew stronger influences from gospel. Notable examples include Adeva and Tony Humphries. Kristine W is an example of a musician involved with garage house outside the genre's origin of birth. :Also known as G-house, it features minimal 808 and 909 drum machine-driven tracks and sometimes sexually explicit lyrics.

O : Outsider house (also referred to as outsider dance or lo-fi house) is a genre of electronic music combining elements of house music, techno and noise music. The music is often rough- sounding and \\"lo-fi\\". P : Progressive house is typified by accelerating peaks and troughs throughout a track's duration and are, in general, less obvious than in hard house. Layering different sounds on top of each other and slowly bringing them in and out of the mix is a key idea behind the progressive movement. It is often related to trance music.

Dentin must be present for enamel to be formed. Ameloblasts must also be present for dentinogenesis to continue. A message is sent from the newly differentiated odontoblasts to the inner enamel epithelium (IEE) that causes epithelial cells to further differentiate into active secretory ameloblasts. Dentinogenesis is in turn dependent on signals from the differentiating IEE in order for the process to continue. This prerequisite is an example of the biological concept known as reciprocal induction, in this instance between mesenchymal and epithelial cells. Stages Amelogenesis is considered to have three stages.Ten Cate's Oral Histology, Nanci, Elsevier, 2013, page 133- 148 The first stage is known as the inductive stage, the second is the secretory stage, and the third stage is known as the maturation stage. During the inductive stage, ameloblast differentiation from IEE is initiated. Proteins and an organic matrix form a partially mineralized enamel in the secretory stage. The maturation stage completes enamel mineralization. =Inductive (or pre-secretory) stage= In the inductive stage, the morphodifferentiation phase the shape of the crown is determined by the bell stage of tooth development. There is a basal lamina between the IEE and the dental papilla.Illustrated Dental Embryology, Histology, and Anatomy, Bath-Balogh and Fehrenbach, Elsevier, 2011, page 58 At this time, the dentin is not mineralized. The IEE cuboidal or low columnar with centralized nuclei and poorly developed Golgi complexes. The differentiation phase of the Induction stage is initiated by the presence of newly formed predentin. The IEE cells then elongate and become preameloblasts. There is a shift in polarity. Each preameloblast elongates and becomes an postmitotic, polarized, secretory ameloblast. However, there are no Tomes' process yet. It is at this stage that a signal is sent from the newly differentiated ameloblasts back across the dentinoenamel junction (DEJ) to stimulate dentinogenesis. =Secretory stage= In the secretory stage, ameloblasts are polarized columnar cells. In the rough endoplasmic reticulum of these cells, enamel proteins are released into the surrounding area and contribute to what is known as the enamel matrix, which is then partially mineralized by the enzyme alkaline phosphatase. When this first layer is formed, the ameloblasts move away from the interface with dentin, allowing for the development of Tomes' processes at the end of the cell which is in contact with the DEJ. Tomes' process is the term given to the end of the cell which lays down the crystals of the enamel matrix. The Tomes' processes are angled, which introduces differences in crystallite orientation, and hence structure. Enamel formation continues around the adjoining ameloblasts, resulting in a walled area, or pit, that houses a Tomes' process, and also around the end of each Tomes' process, resulting in a deposition of enamel matrix inside of each pit. The matrix within the pit will eventually become an enamel rod, and the walls will eventually become interrod enamel. The only distinguishing factor between the two is the orientation of the calcium crystals. =Maturation stage= In the maturation stage, the ameloblasts transport substances used in the formation of enamel. Microscopically, the most notable aspect of this phase is that these cells become striated, or have a ruffled border. These signs demonstrate that the ameloblasts have changed their function from production, as in the secretory stage, to transportation. Proteins used for the mineralization process compose most of the material transported into the matrix, importantly amelogenins, ameloblastins, enamelins, and tuftelins. The Ca2+ mainly comes from the enamel organ, and not the dental papilla, by either passive, extracellular transportation or active, intracellular transportation. The active route is controlled by ameloblasts so the site of mineralization can have a tightly controlled climate, including modulation of proteins that inhibit mineralization (e.g. Serum-derived Albumin) and concentration of ions. As enamel is secreted, some mineralisation occurs by Ca2+ deposition between nanospheres of amelogenins forming crystallites. Tuftelin also is suggested to have a role in directing the initial deposition. The undermineralised, immature enamel containing long, thin prisms of hydroxyapatite, now matures. As the prisms in the enamel grow in thickness but not length, proteins (amelogenins and most non-amelogenins) are removed from the matrix to give more space for hydroxyapatite deposition - mature crystals are hexagonal and 25x75nm and can run the whole length of the enamel (up to 2.5mm).Ten Cate's Oral Histology, Nanci, Elsevier, 2013, page 149-154 The mineralising enamel becomes progressively less porous. During this process, enamelins and tuftelin are left in the enamel (responsible for enamel tufts). By the end of this stage, the enamel has completed its mineralization. Enamel mineralization only occurs once (as ameloblasts are lost with eruption within the reduced enamel epithelium); therefore after amelogenesis, enamel production has been finalized.Max A. Listgarten, University of Pennsylvania and Temple University, http://www.dental.pitt.edu/informatics/periohistology/en/gu0302.htm This is in contrast to dentin formation which occurs throughout life (secondary dentin production).

It is believed to involve electric potentials. It is named for the scientist who first described the effect, Takuma Tanada.Rajiv Kumar Sinha. Modern Plant Physiology CRC Press, 2004. pg. 457 The phenomenon was observed while Dr. Tanada was rinsing glassware and noticed that excised root tips occasionally stuck to pyrex beakers. Upon investigating the phenomenon closely he determined that this process could be studied in a mixture of ATP, ascorbate, auxin, magnesium, manganese and potassium. The tips would stick when the beaker was swirled slowly. Most importantly, the reaction was light dependent. Exposure to red light would cause the tips to stick, while exposure to far-red would allow them to release. This simple experiment was indicative of phytochrome function, and the rapid nature of the response suggested that changes in bioelectric potential were seminal events in phytochrome signal propagation. Root tips stick to glass surfaces because they acquire a positive electrostatic charge due to some unknown effect from exposure to red light. The glass surface has a negative charge due to adsorbed phosphate ions. The opposite charges attract each other. This phenomenon is the first reported generation of a bioelectric potential by a photomorphogenic pigment. Several years later, Dr. TanadaTanada, T. \\"Boron ‚Äì key element in the actions of Phytochrome and gravity?\\" Planta 143:111 (1978) found that the electric charge is generated by the trace element boron.

He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Milwaukee Brewers, Seattle Mariners, Arizona Diamondbacks and Tampa Bay Rays. He was named an MLB All-Star in 2011. Weeks bats and throws right-handed. Until the 2009 season, Weeks had a distinctive batting stance similar to that of Gary Sheffield, waggling his bat heavily before swinging. The waggle is still present, but noticeably less aggressive. Weeks pointed to this change when asked about his improved presence at the plate in 2009. While primarily a second baseman throughout his career, Weeks transitioned to left field in 2015 and played first base in his final season. Amateur career Born and raised in Altamonte Springs, Florida, Weeks attended Lake Brantley High School. At Lake Brantley, Weeks played baseball, but also played football as a cornerback and wide receiver for a season. Weeks then attended Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. As a sophomore in 2002, he batted .495 with 20 home runs, winning the NCAA Division I batting title. The next year, he batted .479 with 16 home runs, winning a second straight batting title and finishing his career with a .465 batting average (254 of 546), highest in NCAA history. In 2003, he also was named Baseball America College Player of the Year and the Golden Spikes Award, given annually to the top amateur player. The Milwaukee Brewers selected him second overall in the 2003 MLB Draft. Professional career =Milwaukee Brewers= 2003‚Äì2009 Rickie Weeks and Prince Fielder at Brewers spring training in 2005 Weeks signed a contract with a $3.6 million signing bonus. He made his major league debut on September 15, 2003. Weeks did not become a full-time player for the Brewers until June 2005, when he was recalled from the Triple-A Nashville Sounds, despite playing much of the 2005 season with a thumb injury. In his first full MLB season in 2005, Weeks had a batting average of .239 to go with 13 home runs and 15 stolen bases in 96 games. These HR/SB number are consistent with his minor league totals (playing in 209 games) of 21 home runs and 24 stolen bases. In 2006, Weeks hit .279 with 8 home runs, 34 RBIs, and 19 stolen bases in 95 games. Weeks returned to the Nashville Sounds on July 31, 2007, since he was batting below .200 after returning from a wrist injury. Weeks in 2007 In 2008, he had the lowest fielding percentage (.975) and the most errors (15) of all NL second basemen. On offense, however, Weeks scored 46.6% of the time he reached base, second-best in the NL. In Game 1 of the 2008 NL Division Series, Weeks made a key error in the third inning that led to three unearned runs scored by the Phillies in Philadelphia's 3‚Äì1 victory. In Game 3, Weeks injured his knee while trying to beat out a throw at first base. He underwent surgery the next day to remove torn cartilage from his left knee. On February 3, 2009, Weeks and the Brewers reached a one-year deal worth $2.45 million, thereby avoiding salary arbitration. Weeks could have earned an additional $100,000 in performance bonuses based on plate appearances from 575 to 650. In early 2009, sabermetrician Bill James wrote in John Dewan's \\"The Fielding Bible Volume II,\\" that Weeks should be moved to a position other than second base, as he had 44 defensive misplays that season. Dewan ranked Weeks the worst starting second baseman in the majors. Advanced metrics in 2008 however saw him as being only slightly below average.Major League Leaderboards ¬ª 2008 ¬ª Second Basemen ¬ª Fielding Statistics  FanGraphs Baseball Back atop the lineup to begin the 2009 season, Weeks had a .281/.333/.486 start with five home runs in April. On May 18, 2009, Weeks was diagnosed with a torn muscle in his left wrist, and missed the remainder of the 2009 season. At the time of his injury, Weeks was tied with Prince Fielder for the team lead in home runs. 2010‚Äì2014 Playing in 160 games, Weeks recorded his finest season as a pro, and perhaps the best all-around season a Brewer second baseman has ever had. On June 12, 2010, Weeks tallied his 500th hit at Miller Park and received a standing ovation. Weeks finished with a career-high 29 home runs and 83 RBIs, a .269 average, and a strong .366 on-base percentage. His WAR of 6.0 rated 2nd among all regular second basemen, behind only Robinson Cano.Major League Leaderboards ¬ª 2010 ¬ª Second Basemen ¬ª Dashboard  FanGraphs Baseball He led the NL in at bats (651), plate appearances (754), and hit by pitch (25), and was second in runs scored (112). On February 16, 2011, Weeks signed a contract extension for 4 years at $38 million. The deal includes an option for a 5th year provided Weeks is an everyday player in 2013 and 2014, and could raise the total value of the contract to $50 million. Weeks was voted by the fans to be the starting second baseman for the National League in the 2011 All-Star Game. Weeks sustained a severe ankle sprain while legging out an infield single in July. Weeks was placed on the DL until early September, and his offensive production was significantly hampered down the stretch. On September 27, in the second to last game of the regular season, Weeks hit one of the longest home runs ever hit at Miller Park, off the stadium club windows in left field. It was his first home run since his return from the DL, and his 20th of the season. He ended his regular season at .269 with 20 home runs. Advanced defensive metrics pegged him as a league-average defender at the keystone, and his WAR of 3.3 was good for 3rd in the National League.National League Leaderboards ¬ª 2011 ¬ª Second Basemen ¬ª Dashboard  FanGraphs Baseball Despite a slow start in April and May 2012, Weeks rebounded beginning in June and posted typical power numbers, albeit with a dip in his on-base totals, which had been a hallmark of his value to that point. Weeks had a poor 2013 season, posting career lows in nearly all major offensive categories. A torn hamstring ended his season in August, and Scooter Gennett replaced him at second base. In the 2014 season, his contract year with Milwaukee, Weeks has assumed the right-handed part of Milwaukee's productive second base platoon, starting versus all left-handed starting pitchers. Although over only 286 plate appearances, he returned to pre-2012 form hitting .274/.357/.452. With Gennett, Brewers second basemen ranked fourth in the National League in Wins Above Replacement, and 11th league-wide. After the 2014 season, the Brewers declined his contract option ending his ten-year tenure with the Brewers.Rickie Weeks approaches the end of his time with the Brewers =Seattle Mariners= 2015 Weeks signed with the Seattle Mariners on a one-year, $2 million contract on February 13, 2015. Weeks received sporadic playing time, and had a .167 batting average with three extra base hits in 95 plate appearances through early June. He was designated for assignment on June 13, and released on June 21. =Arizona Diamondbacks= On February 27, 2016, he signed a minor league contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks. On April 2, 2016, it was announced that Weeks made Arizona's 2016 opening day roster. =Tampa Bay Rays= On February 3, 2017, Weeks signed a minor league contract with the Tampa Bay Rays that included an invitation to spring training. On April 2, 2017 the Tampa Bay Rays announced Weeks had made the opening day roster and would platoon at first base with Logan Morrison.Rays' Rickie Weeks: Logging first start of season - CBSSports.com Weeks went on the DL on June 9 for a shoulder injury and was released on July 24.

It was filmed and completed in December, 1971. The episode was written by Larry Gelbart and directed by Gene Reynolds, who received the Directors Guild of America Award for it. It was also nominated for two Emmys for its direction and writing. In the episode, Ho-Jon, the houseboy of Captains Hawkeye Pierce and Trapper John McIntyre, has been accepted to Hawkeye's college, but they must raise tuition for him if he is to attend. They hold a fund-raising party while their commanding officer, Lt. Col Henry Blake, is away. There, they raffle off a weekend's R & R in Tokyo along with the company of a nurse, much to the chagrin of Majors Frank Burns and Margaret Houlihan. Pilot Returning to the Swamp after a long session in the OR, Hawkeye receives a letter announcing that Ho-Jon has been accepted into his alma mater, though he and Trapper still have the task of coming up with $2,000 for travel and tuition. Hawkeye convinces Trapper that they can accomplish it by raffling off a weekend pass to Tokyo with the company of a gorgeous nurse. They go to Colonel Henry Blake's office to propose the idea to him, and he nervously gives them permission. Hawkeye convinces a nurse, Lt. \\"Dish\\", to agree to be the nurse who will accompany the winner to Tokyo, but he promises that she'll be able to get out of spending any time with the winner. Later on, Hawkeye and Trapper get into an argument with Frank Burns, who, in a fit of rage, destroys their still. Furious with him, they put a bag over his head and throw him out of the tent. When Henry hears about it, he withdraws the passes and cancels the party they had planned to throw for fear that Frank will complain to General Hammond. He adds that he has to see Hammond in Seoul and was unhappy about the party taking place in his absence. However, as Henry is leaving, Radar reveals that he tricked him into signing two passes, so the party can take place. Unfortunately, Hawkeye's and Trapper's happiness is short lived as they discover that Frank was made temporary commander. To get rid of him so they can have their party, Hawkeye injects him with a sedative, wraps a bandage around his face, and puts him in a bed in post-op, prescribing a dose of sedative every hour. An upset Margaret comes to the party in search of Frank, whom she has been unable to find. Suspicious of the activities of Hawkeye and Trapper, she calls General Hammond, a former lover, who is so excited to hear from her that he departs for the 4077 at once. Meanwhile, Hawkeye announces that they have raised $1800 and then has the nurse draw a name for the raffle. Hawkeye has fixed the raffle so that the winner is Father Mulcahy, but unfortunately, he announces this just as Hammond walks in. While the infuriated general questions Hawkeye and Trapper, Margaret walks in with Frank, still sedated and with bandages around his head, and screams at the two of them. Hammond demands that they be arrested, but just in the nick of time, choppers arrive loaded with casualties. After the session, which Hammond participates in, he tells Henry that Hawkeye and Trapper are two of the best surgeons he has ever seen and, for that reason, he is dropping the charges.

The municipality is located on Callander Bay, just south of North Bay. The municipality renamed itself from North Himsworth to Callander in 2003, adopting the name of its major community because, in the words of then-mayor Bill Brazeau, \\"Nobody knew where North Himsworth was.\\"\\"Callander grows selectively\\". Northern Ontario Business, January 2005. Communities The main community of Callander is located in the northeast corner of the municipality, along the eastern shore of Callander Bay. The south shore of Callander Bay and Lake Nipissing (southwest of the town) represents the rural population of Callander, which primarily runs along Highway 654 West. This area includes the communities of Wisawasa and Lighthouse Beach. History Callander Bay is an eroded Proterozoic volcanic pipe formed by the violent, supersonic eruption of a deep-origin volcano, approximately 500 million years ago. It is one of eight known volcanic sites in Ontario, including the Manitou Islands in North Bay. The first people in the Callander area were of Ojibwa and Algonquin descent who have lived around Lake Nipissing for about 9,400 years. Though in history known by many names, they are currently known as Nipissing First Nation. They are generally considered part of the Anishinaabe peoples, a grouping which includes the Odaawaa, Ojibwe and Algonquins. In 1610, French explorer Samuel de Champlain sent a young apprentice, √âtienne Br√ªl√©, to live with the Huron natives at Georgian Bay. While en route, Br√ªl√© discovered Lake Nipissing via the La Vase River Portage (approximately 3 km north of Callander) and established a major fur trading route linking the Ottawa River with the upper Great Lakes. Other explorers who used the La Vase Portage were Samuel de Champlain in 1615, Pierre Gaultier de Varennes, sieur de La V√©rendrye in 1731, Alexander Henry the elder in 1761 and Sir Alexander MacKenzie in 1802. In 1880, George Morrison, a bookkeeper from Oxford County in Southern Ontario travelled by ox- cart from Muskoka to Lake Nipissing. There he built a raft and floated his family and possessions across the lake to the south-east bay. Logging companies had taken interest in the abundant Eastern White Pine that grew in the area. He was one of its first pioneers and his wife was the first white woman. On June 1, 1881, he opened a Post Office in his general store and named it after his parents' Scottish birthplace of Callander. Lumber companies that established mills in Callander included: * J.R.

The person calling said that he did not want to get involved; therefore, he had not called earlier. Detective MacAleese realized that fear and apathy often prevented the public from getting involved. He helped design a system by which the public could anonymously provide details of the events. This system focused on stimulating community involvement and participation, and took advantage of electronic media to publicize unsolved crimes. The police offered cash rewards for information leading to an arrest and/or conviction. Since the first chapter was officially formed in Albuquerque in 1976, Crime Stoppers in the United States has been responsible for more than half a million arrests and more than US$4 billion in recovered property. The first organisation that supported the Crime Stoppers concept was Circle K Stores in New Mexico. After hearing a speech made by Greg MacAleese to the Chamber of Commerce the head of security for Circle K Store, Carl Jones approached MacAleese and said he thought the concept was an excellent idea and asked if he would like help putting the civilian Board of Directors together. MacAleese said, \\"That moment might have been the luckiest in the history of Crime Stoppers\\". The long history between Crime Stoppers and Circle K Stores remains strong to this day, largely due to Sean Sportun who is the head of security for Circle K Stores in Central Canada. Sportun has been an extraordinary advocate for the cause and has been recognized on a local, provincial and international level for his dedicated efforts - in 2019 Sportun received the Crime Stoppers International Civilian of The Year award. Crime Stoppers spread to Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom. While the individual programs are local or regional in nature, mostly run by non-profit groups or directly by police, various national and international umbrella organizations exist. The toll-free telephone number +1-800-222-TIPS is used to reach various different Crime Stoppers groups in Canada and the U.S., although some groups publish their own numbers.Contact Crime Stoppers of Metro Alabama at 205-254-7777 Crime Stoppers of Metro Alabama.Call 713-222-TIPS Crime Stoppers Houston Area.

Taking place in modern-day V√∂r√• in western Finland, it is sometimes regarded as the turning point of the Finnish War: the last chance for Sweden to turn the war to her advantage. It was the bloodiest battle of the conflict, which some historians attribute to the exhaustion, resignation and desperation of the Swedish army: it was losing the war, and defeat led to its loss of Finland to Russia.  Prelude  At the beginning of the war, Swedish forces had retreated to Oulu. They had then managed to repel the Russians and reach Savonia despite the capitulation of the fortress of Sveaborg by the end of summer 1808. Russia recuperated quickly, and by the end of August the Swedish army was again retreating northwards along the coastal road. To avoid being encircled, Colonel Georg Carl von D√∂beln was sent in advance to Nykarleby with a brigade. The threat of encirclement was exaggerated, but the Swedish army was at this point showing signs of panic and collapse. On 13 September the army left for Oravais and it halted to await news from von D√∂beln, who was fighting the Russians at Jutas. The sound of a cannon was heard in Oravais, and a brigade was sent to reinforce von D√∂beln. The Russian main army had marched from Vasa in furious pursuit of the Swedish forces. The night before 14 September was spent in bivouacs along the road between V√∂r√• and Oravais. The impulsive General-Major Yakov Kulnev's troops had taken the lead and were the first to make contact with the Swedes.  Battle  At dawn the first shots were exchanged between Kulnev's troops and a Swedish outpost by a bridge in the forest. Firing intensified, the Swedish position was reinforced continuously while the remainder of the Russian forces behind Kulnev arrived. Fighting continued with heavy losses on both sides until the situation became untenable for the Swedes, who retreated to their defensive positions at 10 a.m. The retreat was covered by a single artillery piece commanded by the fifteen-year-old sublieutenant Wilhelm von Schwerin. The Swedish main position was deployed along a ridge which was protected to the north (on the Swedish right wing) by an inlet from the Baltic, and the Fj√§rds√• stream with its south to north flow provided added defensive potential. The forest in front of the ridge had been cleared to afford the artillery a better view of the arriving Russians, who were regrouping at the edge of the forest. Artillery bombardment then began between the two forces, and continued for an hour until the Russians mounted a frontal assault against the Swedish positions. Kulnev, on the Russian left wing, struck the Swedish right, but was repelled when his force became bogged down in the Fj√§rds√• stream. The Russians now reinforced their right wing, under Nikolay Demidov, and another assault was made. It was also repelled, but this time the Swedish unexplainably left their positions and counterattacked; Adlercreutz had issued no order to that effect. The Swedish counterattack met overpowering fire and was forced to withdraw with heavy losses. At 2 p.m. the battle was far from decided. The Russians made a second attempt at turning the Swedish left flank. This thinned the Russian center, and Adlercreutz ordered a forceful attack to exploit the weakness. Despite the intensive Russian fire, the attack proceeded swiftly, and the whole Swedish line was carried along by the movement. The entire Russian line was forced to retire back into the forest where the battle had begun earlier in the morning. However, dwindling of ammunition frustrated Adlercreutz's attempted decisive stroke. As Russian reinforcements arrived, the spent Swedish army retired to their defensive positions again. At this point the battle was still undecided, but General Kamensky ordered Demidov's right wing to make yet another attempt on the weak Swedish left wing. When this maneuver started night had fallen and the battle had raged for fourteen hours; it became too much for the Swedish army, which hastily retreated to the north.  Aftermath  Positions at the battle The Swedish lieutenant Carl Johan Ljunggren retold the retreat from Oravais like this: > \\"The darkness was such that despite continuous shovings one could not > recognize the shover... Hundreds of noises came out of the night; everywhere > the wounded wailed, each in his own language; artillerymen and coachmen > yelled at their exhausted horses and bellowed scores of curses each time > they became stuck, which happened all the time; wheels and weapons rattled, > soldiers bellowed; all staggered from tiredness and hunger. Thus came the > army finally to Nykarleby. The Russians hadn't followed, for their forces > were also completely spent. The battle of Oravais had shown that the Swedish army was not tactically inferior to the Russian counterpart. However, the Swedish strategic situation was hopeless: allied only with Great Britain, it faced the overnight of Napoleon's Europe and its Russian ally. Oravais was merely one battle on the road to final Swedish defeat.

The museum closed in 2014, and its collections are now part of New Museum Los Gatos. The building is currently owned by the City. The mill is the first commercial building to be established in the city of Los Gatos. The existing two-story building is actually a storage annex, which was added to the original four-story stone mill building in the fall of 1880. Forbes Mill was built as the Santa Rosa Flour Mill by James Alexander Forbes, who was born in Scotland in 1805. He came to California in about 1831 and served as Vice-Consul in San Francisco for the British government. The California Gold Rush gave James the idea to put up a flour mill because there were none in California at the time, and the price of flour was running at $50/barrel. He found a location on Los Gatos Creek that he thought would provide sufficient water power. In 1850, he purchased in the area of the Los Gatos Creek and proceeded to build a mill. In 1853, he raised the money for the construction, borrowing $130,000 from two lenders (including one who charged an interest rate of 3% per month), and in 1854, the mill was built. However, the milling machinery had to be shipped from New York around Cape Horn. Once it arrived, Forbes had trouble installing it, but eventually, the mill started grinding flour on December 1, 1855. The opening of Forbes Mill was an auspicious moment in the history of the Santa Clara Valley. Built on the site of a Mexican ranch, the mill represented the shift of land ownership from the Californio Dons to the new settlers arriving after the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. The first three stories of the mill were built of stone quarried from the Los Gatos Canyon. The top story was wood, cut from trees in the mountains above Los Gatos. In 1880, an annex was attached to the north wall of the mill building. The town that grew around this building was first called Forbes Mill, then Forbestown, and finally Los Gatos. Forbes Mill ca. 1900 Unfortunately, Forbes knew nothing about flour milling. He had built a dam upstream on the creek, carrying water via a flume to two high water wheels. However, a high water drop proved to be inefficient, so he had to keep raising the water level. Not only that, but there was also only enough water in the creek to power the mill during the winter months, meaning that the machinery sat idle for much of the year. Furthermore, by the time the mill was in operation, competing mills had been constructed, and the Gold Rush was coming to an end, thus driving flour prices down to a mere $5/barrel. Besides his outstanding loans, Forbes had also lost a lot of money speculating on wheat and flour and was forced into bankruptcy. He eventually defaulted on his loans, and the mill and land were sold in 1857 to Gustave Touchard, one of his creditors. Forbes continued to operate the mill for Touchard but ultimately was evicted from the property in 1858. Touchard hired others to run the mill, but they did not have much success with it either, although he was able to sell parcels of the land for a small profit. In 1866, he sold the mill to William H. Rogers, who had previously worked at a flour mill in Detroit and had opened his own Mountain Flourmills (one of Santa Rosa's competitors) in Placerville. He had sold his interest in his company in 1860 and served as postmaster of Placerville and sheriff of El Dorado County until his purchase of now-named \\"Clifton Mill\\". His first act was to raise the waterhead to , replace the water wheels with turbine wheels, and upgrade the machinery. With his experience, Rogers was able to turn the mill into a profitable operation. In 1869, he brought in partners WS McMurtry and JW McMillen and renamed the company as the Los Gatos Manufacturing Co. The waterhead was increased to , and the company constructed reservoirs to hold enough water to allow for year- round production. With these improvements, the mill was able to produce 100 barrels of flour a day. In 1881, the Los Gatos News wrote, \\"While other cities and towns may boast of a larger population, for the manufacture of the finest grade of flour known to the markets of the civilized world, Los Gatos Flouring Mills stands preeminent.\\" right It continued as a flour mill until 1887 when it successively became a power plant for the Los Gatos Ice and Power Company, a brewing and bottling company, the Los Gatos Gas Company, and finally the PG&E; substation for Los Gatos. The original \\"Santa Rosa\\" Flour Mill building was torn down in 1916. The mill remained a storehouse for PG&E; until after World War II. It was then abandoned and finally, in 1971, it was revived as a youth center for Los Gatos with live rock music on Friday and Saturday nights. On June 10, 1950, the California Centennial Commission commemorated the mill's contribution to the State's rich past by designating it as California Historical Landmark number 458. It is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

It was established in 1573 as a public university led by the Jesuit order in Olomouc, which was at that time the capital of Moravia and the seat of the episcopacy. At first it taught only theology, but soon the fields of philosophy, law and medicine were added. After the Bohemian King Joseph II's reforms in the 1770s the university became increasingly state-directed, while today it is a public university. During the Revolution of 1848 university students and professors played a very active role on the side of democratisation. The conservative king Francis Joseph I closed most of its faculties during the 1850s, but they were reopened by an act of the Interim National Assembly passed on 21 February 1946. This act also extended the name from University of Olomouc to Palack√Ω University Olomouc, naming it for Franti≈°ek Palack√Ω, a 19th-century Moravian historian and politician. Today the university is an example of an old university in a small town, like Yale University in New Haven and the University of T√ºbingen in T√ºbingen. The town of Olomouc has 100,000 inhabitants (and as many again in its suburbs), and some 25,000 university students (including those at Moravian College Olomouc), which is the highest density of university students in Central Europe. The town itself is very old and picturesque and it is surrounded by sports facilities and nature. Many distinguished figures have taught, worked and studied here including Albrecht von Wallenstein and Gregor Mendel. History Mula, Spain 1526 ‚Äì Olomouc 1594) The university is the oldest in Moravia and the second oldest in the Czech Crown lands. Its foundation was an important element of the Counter- Reformation in Moravia, as the church of Rome began its fight back against Protestantism. Roughly 90% of the population of the Czech lands was already Protestant by the time the Habsburgs took over the throne in 1526. The Protestant Hussites were working for the provision of universal education, which was a particular challenge for the Catholics. By the middle of the century there was not a single town without a Protestant school in the Czech lands, and many had more than one, mostly with two to six teachers each. In Jihlava, a principal Protestant center in Moravia, there were six schools: two Czech, two German, one for girls and one teaching in Latin, which was at the level of a high / grammar school, lecturing on Latin, Greek and Hebrew, Rhetorics, Dialectics, fundamentals of Philosophy and fine arts, as well as religion according to the Lutheran Augustana. With the University of Prague also firmly in hands of Protestants, the local Catholic church was unable to compete in the field of education. Therefore, the Jesuits were invited, with the backing of the Catholic Habsburg rulers, to come to the Czech lands and establish a number of Catholic educational institutions, foremost the Academy in Prague and the one in Olomouc. The Olomouc bishop Vil√©m Prusinovsk√Ω z V√≠ckova invited the Jesuits to Olomouc in 1566. The Jesuits established a monastery, and then progressively established the Gymnasium (school) , the Academy, the Priest Seminary, and the Seminary of St. Francis Xavier For Poor Students. The college was promoted to University status in 1573, and thence the and the Academy of Nobility were established. The university was closed during plagues in 1599 and 1623, and during the Bohemian Revolt in the Thirty Years' War. It was ransacked by the Swedish Empire's armies. In the Counter- Reformation and succeeding decades, it became significantly influential as the Jesuit grip loosened. In 1773, after the dissolution of the Jesuit order, it was turned into a secular institution run by the State. In the end, it was separated from the Olomouc episcopal institutions and relocated to Brno in 1778. It returned to Olomouc four years later, its status downgraded to that of a lyceum. In 1827 it once again was promoted to University status. The short life of this renamed \\"Francis University\\" (Franzens-Universit√§t Olm√ºtz, 1827 ‚Äì 1860) perhaps eclipses its high scientific standard (especially in natural sciences, law and medicine) and its political importance, particularly in the \\"Springtime of Peoples\\" during the Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas, when it became the centre of the struggle for national revival in Moravia. The Habsburg r√©gime retaliated by closing most of the university in the 1850s. Olomouc's university was fully re-established in 1946, inaugurating the modern era of the university. =Before the university= Education in Olomouc had a long tradition before the Jesuit College obtained University status. As early as 1249 a school was established by the Bishop of Olomouc Bruno ze ≈†amberka. Lectures covered grammar, dialectic, rhetoric and liturgy. The first Master, Bohumil, was appointed in 1286. In 1492 the first college dignitary, He≈ôman, was appointed. The college was rebuilt by Bishop Marek Khuen z Olomouce in 1564 to provide lectures both to public administrators and to prospective teachers. His successor Vil√©m Prusinovsk√Ω z V√≠ckova invited Jesuits to Olomouc in 1566. Several education initiatives rapidly ensued in the city: it is apparent that by 1567 the Jesuits were running the college. The Olomouc episcopacy pledged to finance the college with 500 Tolars a year (the amount was raised to 2000 Tolars a year in 1570). =Founding of the Jesuit University= A sundial commemorating the quatercentenary of Olomouc University (1573‚Äì1973) on the facade of the Faculty of Philosophy On 22 December 1573 Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor appointed Jan Grodeck√Ω to be Bishop of Olomouc and at the same time gave the Olomouc Jesuit College the right to award university degrees. The first rector was (Mula, Spain 1526 ‚Äì Olomouc 1594). University education itself started on 3 October 1576, when the Englishman George Warr started to lecture on philosophy. In the same year the first students were officially enrolled in the university's registry and the students were \\"subdued\\" in an admission ceremony, which was supposed to relieve them of base morals. In 1578 the authority of the university was expanded by the creation of a special papal seminary ( called in (a second Collegium Nordicum was established in Braunsberg; the one in Olomouc lasted until 1741) The previous sphere of responsibility, which had covered Silesia, Poland, Hungary and the Austrian lands as well as Moravia, was now broadened to include Germany, Scandinavia and Eastern Europe.In years 1578‚Äì1624 the Collegium nordicum had students from following countries: Czech Crown lands 231 (40%), Scandinavia 94 (16%), German lands 88 (15%), Hungary and Transylvania 73 (13%), Poland‚ÄìLithuania 34 (6%), Prussia 20 (4%), other 31 (6%); see Jaroslav Miller: Urban societies in East-Centra Europe: 1500‚Äì1700 The aim of the seminary was to create devoted and well-educated Catholic priests who would then return to their homelands, and there promote and protect the Catholic Church's interests and objectives. In 1581 the university received an Imperial Privilege from the emperor Rudolf II, whereby degrees awarded by the Jesuit University had the same value as those from any comparable university. At the same time the privilege established university jurisdiction over students and professors, which meant that university members enjoyed a form of clerical immunity and could not face trial before civil courts even in respect of criminal proceedings. In 1582 the Bishop and Jesuits forced the Protestant school in Olomouc to close. Meanwhile, the bishop, Stanislav Pavlovsk√Ω, called for the establishment of faculties of law and medicine. He was able to convince the rector, Bartolomƒõj Villerius, to support his proposal. Later in the 1588 the emperor Rudolf II, in a document written in the Czech language, gave his support for establishment of all these faculties; however the idea failed at the time due to lack of finance. In 1590 the university had about 600 students, while by 1617 their number exceeded one thousand. In the era before the Battle of White Mountain Olomouc University was composed of a grouping of connected and comprehensive colleges and dormitories. The areas taught were humaniora (preparation for university-level studies), philosophy (liberal arts), and theology. Rudolf II was succeeded in 1612 by his brother, the Emperor Matthias who sought to install the fiercely Catholic Ferdinand of Styria on the Bohemian throne (which was conjoined with that of the March of Moravia), but in 1618 the Protestant Bohemian and Moravian noblemen, who feared losing religious freedom (two of the Protestant churches being already forcibly closed), started the Bohemian Revolt. Consequently, the Jesuits were driven out of Olomouc and the university ceased operating, only to be restored in 1621 after the revolt was crushed. The Jesuits and the university benefited considerably from the defeat of Protestants: most of the Protestant nobles were either executed or expelled after the Revolt and their properties were confiscated. Prior to the Revolt the university was mostly funded from donations of patrons. However, the new Emperor Ferdinand II gave the university several substantial estates which he had confiscated from the defeated rebels. Foremost among these was the manor of Nov√Ω Jiƒç√≠n which provided a good income. Other properties donated by the Emperor included a farm formerly owned by Jan Adam Prus√≠novsk√Ω, a relative of the founder of the Jesuit college. From 1622 the entire education system of the Czech Crown lands was placed under Jesuit control, including even the University of Prague and the University of Wroc≈Çaw (Silesia was also a Czech Crown land at the time). By 1631 the university had some 1100 students of which around thirty were annually conferred Doctor of Philosophy title. The lectures on mathematics allured so wide audience, that they eventually became open to public. Students-at-arms * In 1639 the Swedish Army besieged Olomouc. 400 University students joined the protection guard. * In 1683 the Polish-Lithuanian army was passing Olomouc on its way to Battle of Vienna. 288 university students swore a military oath in the university aula and joined the troops in the fight against Ottomans. * In 1848 the university students established armed academic legion of 382 men. Many of them left the town and took part in revolutionary actions in Vienna. The Thirty Years' War (1618‚Äì48) prevented further development of the university. The Swedish kings wanted to destroy once and for all the bases from which the Catholic Church and the Jesuit Order drew the manpower and economic resources needed for their attempts to reintroduce the spiritual rule of Rome into the Scandinavian North. These were foremost the Jesuit College in Braunsberg, which fell into the Swedish hands in 1626, and Olomouc. The Swedes occupied Olomouc from 1642 to 1650. They plundered the university's vast library and the population of the town declined from over to . As a result, Olomouc University's most precious relics are now in the National Library of Sweden in Stockholm, including codices made under the patronage of Bishop of Olomouc Jind≈ôich Zd√≠k. =Revival and expansion after the Thirty Years' War= After the war ended the Jesuits started an extensive construction programme, building a series of imposing Baroque buildings for the Order and University in order to advertise their newly acquired domination of the Czech lands. This was happening against the background of savage re-Catholization which, along with war and plague saw the population decline from over 3 million to some 800,000 people. Even the Czech language was considered to be heresy by the Jesuits who were burning books written in Czech: the language was gradually reduced to nothing more than a means of communication between peasants, most of whom were illiterate. The era, generally described as the Dark Age of the Czech Nation, was nevertheless a period of expansion for the Jesuit University of Olomouc: several sciences were now taught at the university, including mathematics and physics (by Jakub Kresa and Jan Tes√°nek), and cartography (by Valentin Stansel). Hebrew was also studied. Among notable people connected with the university at the time are the mathematician Jan Marek Marci and the historian Bohuslav Balb√≠n. Olomouc University Thesis from 1713The make-up of the university changed. Before the war the majority of lecturers were foreigners: now most of them were from Czech Crown lands. The number of students rose to 1,500 in 1727: in addition to locals there were many students from Hungary, Lusatia, Poland and Lithuania as well as from Russia. The Jesuit College building in 1724Most of the older Protestant nobility having been either killed or expelled, the new Moravian nobility were keen to expand the range of areas taught beyond just theology and philosophy. Despite opposition from the Jesuits, the Emperor Leopold I authorized the introduction of legal studies in 1679. A vigorous power struggle between the Jesuits and secular legal professors ensued. Several interventions by Emperors were needed to keep the legal studies going during the following decades. Karel Ferdinand Irmler started to lecture in both canonicalCanon Law had already been taught in the Faculty of Theology since 1667. and secular law at the university. However, the quarrels with the rector became so intense that the nobility requested him to teach only secular law. Consequently, he was forbidden to give lectures at the university and had to teach in his home, while later professors gave law lectures in the building of Olomouc court. In 1725 the nobility forced the establishment of the ‚Äì the Academy of Nobility ‚Äì by the decree of Emperor Charles VI. By this time the Emperor had compelled the Jesuits to accept without obstruction the study of secular law at the university. The law professors were lecturing at both the university and the academy (where in addition to law, economics, mathematics, geometry, history and geography along with architecture ‚Äì both civil and military ‚Äì were also now available). The academy remained in Olomouc until 1847, when it was relocated to Brno: here it became the basis for what was later to become the Brno University of Technology. =Under state control= During the rule of Queen Maria Theresa of Austria (from 1740 to her death in 1780) tertiary education in the Habsburg Monarchy underwent reform in an effort to put it under state control. At Olomouc the Office of Faculty Directors was established in 1752: the directors were directly answerable to the Queen. In 1754 there were 10 professors of theology giving lectures to 241 students, 5 professors of philosophy giving lectures to 389 students and 3 professors of law giving lectures to 40 students. The number of students reached its peak in 1772, when there were altogether 1859 of them. Meanwhile, in 1746, Faculty of Philosophy alumni Joseph von Petrasch established the first learned society in the lands under control of Austrian Habsburgs, the Societas eruditorum incognitorum in terris Austriacis. Not connected with the university, the Olomouc-based Society was publishing the first scientific journal in the monarchy, the Monatliche ausz√ºge. The power struggle between the empress Maria Theresa and Jesuits escalated in 1765. Until then, the position of university's Rector Magnificus was automatically in the hands of the rector of the Jesuit order. Firstly, the Empress took away the Jesuit's monopoly over the position by imposing that the Rector Magnificus was to be elected by academia. As a theologian was elected Rector Magnificus in 1765, the empress assumed the power and appointed her own favourite, secular professor of law Johann Heinrich B√∂senselle, as the head of university in 1766. Meanwhile, the Empress decided to fortify the town heavily, in line with contemporary practice and reflecting the increased military threat from Prussia. The consequence of constraining the city within its upgraded fortifications was that scope for commercial development became very restricted. Olomouc's experience was in stark contrast with that of Brno to the south, which was further away from the Silesian war zones, and which became the centre of the Moravian Industrial Revolution. In July 1773, responding to pressure from the new emperor, Pope Clement XIV dissolved the Jesuit Order and the university came under intensified state control. Several university buildings were taken over for use by the army, and by the end of the 1770s the university was left with only the St. Xavier's building (currently the Faculty of Theology). At the same time the main language was changed from Latin to German; the Czech language remained in use for lectures to trainee priests, who would need it to communicate with their congregations. Czech gained importance in the 1830s as part of the Czech National Revival. = Temporary relocation: the university downgraded = By the closing decades of the eighteenth century Brno had become the de facto capital of Moravia. This fact, as well as dissatisfaction with the university management due to persisting influence of the Church, led to the university relocating there in 1778. In Brno, the number of students declined to mere 575. There were nine professors at the faculty of theology, two at law and four at philosophy (one of which was professor of Political science, which would later become part of the faculty of law). However, at the end of 1777 the diocese of Olomouc had been elevated to the status of an archdiocese, and in 1782 the first Archbishop of Olomouc Anton√≠n Theodor Colloredo-Waldsee enforced relocation back by decree of Emperor Joseph II. At the same time the institution lost its university status, becoming a mere academic Lyceum. The Emperor had decided to retain only three universities, in Prague, Vienna, and Lviv.Other universities were reduced to lyceum status at the same time, including, in the Austrian heartland, the universities at Innsbruck and at Graz Teaching of medicine became a separate field, in which surgeons and obstetricians' assistants were taught. A history of persecutions Olomouc University was a product of persecution: the Olomouc bishop invited Jesuits to convert local Protestants to Catholicism. Later the Olomouc Academic community itself suffered from a succession of tyrannies in the Czech lands: *The Habsburg Absolutists put the university under state control in the 1750s, and eventually closed it (apart from the Faculty of Theology) in the 1850s. *The German occupation of Czechoslovakia led to the closure of all Czech Universities in 1939 (see International Students' Day): students and professors from the Faculty of Theology were enslaved and deported to work in Germany. *Following the 1948 communist coup d'√©tat the Faculty of Theology was closed again in 1950, as part of a wider wave of oppression across the country. *The Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 brought yet more persecution. One in four of the lecturers was affected in some way. Significant loss of rights and privileges resulted from the change to an academic Lyceum. Legal jurisdiction over professors and students was no more: in 1783 the right to award Masters and Doctoral degrees was taken over by the Emperor (Bachelor degrees in philosophy were however awarded until 1821), and lectures were significantly cut back. However, after the death of Joseph II the situation gradually eased. Theology courses were restored to a full five years, while Philosophy was extended to three years and by 1810 Legal Studies took four years. By 1804 the Lyceum had some 730 students, which was comparable with University of Prague's 760. In 1805 studies were temporarily suspended, as many students entered the army during the Napoleonic Wars. Another suspension of lectures took place in 1809 because the Lyceum's buildings were taken over to accommodate army personnel. In 1826, there were altogether 26 professors at the Lyceum. = University status restored = Attempts to restore the Lyceum to full university status finally succeeded in 1827, when the Cardinal Archbishop of Olomouc, Rudolf Johannes Joseph Rainier von Habsburg-Lothringen (brother of the Emperor Francis II), persuaded the Emperor to promote the Lyceum, which now became the Francis University, with Faculties of Philosophy, Theology, and Law and School of Medicine and Surgery. The university was again reaching its previous standard. For example, in 1839 there were seven law, seven philosophy and one theology doctoral degrees awarded, while 25 graduates obtained diploma in medicine and surgery. The number of students of Medicine and Surgery rose to some 100 every year, which was the second highest in the lands under control of Austrian Habsburgs (after University of Graz). Olomouc became important centre of Czech National awakening. In 1834 the Department of Czech Language and Literature was established at the Academy. = Olomouc University in the year of revolutions = The 1848 revolution was welcomed by the university's students and professors. Some 11,000 people lived in Olomouc by this time, which was only a third of estimated population level back in 1600. The local garrison in 1848 nevertheless contained some 5,000 soldiers, which was a powerful anti- revolutionary force. Mostly the students and professors of law and philosophy were supportive of the Revolution, while the theologians distanced themselves from it. In March 1848 the students and professors petitioned the Emperor requesting, among other things, lectures in the Czech language and extensions to the university's freedoms and privileges. Later during the same month they established armed Academic Legion of 382 men: its first company consisted of lawyers while the second comprised philosophers and members of the medical faculty. Many of these left Olomouc in order to support the actions of revolutionary students in Vienna. Leading revolutionaries from Olomouc University included professors Ign√°c Jan Hanu≈°, Jan Helcelet and Andreas Jeitteles. These, together with students, participated in associations and started newspapers in Czech and German. The black-red-golden flag of Burschenschaft waived over the university buildings. Although many students were supporting the Revolution regardless of their ethnicity, there was a clear ideological split between the Czech and German partisans as to the aims of the Revolution. While the German faction supported the goal of a \\"Greater Germany\\", the Czech side favoured some form of democratic federation of Austrian and Slavic nations. The Czechs took part in the Prague Slavic Congress while the \\"Greater Germany\\" faction joined in the Frankfurt Congress. Growing government alarm was reflected at the Olomouc fortress which was in full combat readiness by July 1848, which was enough to deter revolutionary actions in the town. By October 1848 the Revolution in this region had been defeated, and indeed the Emperor with his court moved to Olomouc where, at the archbishop's palace, he abdicated in favour of his nephew in December 1848. At the university, supporters of Revolution were persecuted, while many who had remained conservative (including, notably, Theology Faculty members) would in the longer term benefit from their restraint. = Decline and closure = 1998 copy of Olomouc University Rector's Mace - the original from ca. 1572 is as of 2013 still held by the Innsbruck University The university came out of the revolution as an essentially bilingual (Czech and German) institution. In due course the university's support for the democratisation and the Czech National Revival brought retribution from the government in Vienna. In 1851, as the r√©gime regained self-confidence, growing government intolerance of dissent and the subsequent decline in student numbers led to the closure of the Faculty of Philosophy. The Faculty of Law, which in 1849 had actually started teaching in the Czech language, was closed at the start of the 1855/56 academic year. In 1860 Emperor Franz Joseph I closed virtually the whole university. Only the independent Faculty of Theology and the independent University Library remained open, for nearly another eighty years, until, following the German invasion, all the Czech Universities were closed in November 1939. The School of Surgery also survived the emperor's decree in 1860, but closed in 1875. Olomouc University's regalia were transferred to University of Innsbruck. Since the establishment of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the Czechs have been unsuccessfully requesting return of University of Olomouc original ceremonial equipment. The situation as of 2013 is as follows: * The Olomouc University Rector's Chain from around 1566‚Äì1573 is used as the Innsbruck Medical University Rector's Chain * The Olomouc University Rector's Mace from 1572 is used as the Innsbruck Faculty of Theology Dean's Mace * The Olomouc Faculty of Philosophy Dean's Mace from 1588 is used as the Innsbruck Medical University Rector's Mace * The Olomouc Faculty of Law Dean's mace from 1833 is used as the Innsbruck Faculty of Law Dean's Mace There were efforts to reopen the university during the 1890s and again, after the establishment of an independent Czechoslovakia, in 1918, but all these attempts failed. =Restoration of the university= Photo from Academia Film Olomouc in 2009 On 21 February 1946 the Interim National Assembly passed the Olomouc University Restoration Act, which anticipated restoration of Faculties of Theology, Law, Medicine, Philosophy. Exactly one year later, the university was reopened,The Faculty of Theology was working already from summer semester 1944/1945 after the liberation of Olomouc by the 60th Soviet Army with no Faculty of Law but one of Education, which was established by a separate Act of 9 April 1946. The Communist takeover in 1948 led to changes that would affect all Czech universities. Palack√Ω University was hit by the persecutions, but since the university had only recently reopened, relatively few members of the Palack√Ω academic community were affected. Nevertheless, in 1950 the Faculty of Theology was closed again, reflecting the Communist government's mistrust of the churches. The establishment in 1952 of the Olomouc School of Education (with faculties of Social Sciences and Natural Sciences) was followed by a gradual closure of the Faculty of Philosophy and Faculty of Education. Therefore, in years 1954‚Äì1958 the Palack√Ω University had only Faculty of Medicine. The School of Education was itself closed in 1958, re- establishing once again the university's Faculty of Philosophy, and affiliating the Faculty of Science. The Faculty of Education was created later in 1964: the university, as in earlier centuries, once again consisted of four faculties. During the Prague Spring, which attracted much international attention in 1968, many members of the Palack√Ω academic community took part in democratisation efforts, seeking to move the ruling totalitarian dictatorship towards socialist democracy. The movement was crushed and the reforms reversed when combined Warsaw Pact armies from the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, East Germany, Hungary and Poland invaded Czechoslovakia. Soviet military occupation followed. At this time the Union of University Students of Bohemia and Moravia, a new student organisation, was established at Olomouc, and later organised student strikes in Autumn 1968. At the same time efforts were made to restore the Faculty of Theology, but they failed and it remained no more than a branch of the Charles University Theological Faculty of Litomƒõ≈ôice, and was forced to shut down again in 1974. The Communist regime's efforts to \\"restore order\\" in a so-called Normalization process between 1969 and 1989, involved mass purges of academic staff, which in one way or another affected one lecturer in four. In 1989 the Student Strike Committee was the only Velvet Revolution movement in Olomouc. Today the university comprises 8 faculties with some students. The university is also the patron of the annual Academia Film Olomouc festival and Olomouc Festival of Film Animation. =Timeline= Reconstructed Jesuit building, which now serves as the University Art Centre Courtyard of the University Art Centre *1573‚Äì1773: The Jesuit University.

Faculties The Palack√Ω University has eight faculties. These faculties are theology, philosophy, law, medicine and dentistry, education, science, physical culture, and health science (in historical order). As of 2011, four of the faculties have female deans (theology, law, education and health sciences). There is no faculty of technology, as there are three technological universities within about hour's drive from Olomouc (Technical University in Ostrava to the North, University of Technology in Brno to the South and Tom√°≈° Ba≈•a University in Zl√≠n to the East). =Saints Cyril and Methodius Faculty of Theology= Saints Cyril and Methodius Faculty of Theology building from 1675, rebuilt to current form in 1718 The Faculty of Theology is the oldest one, being there already in 1573 when the Olomouc College was promoted to the university. It was perceived by the Czech Protestant population as the core symbol of recatholization forced by Habsburgs, which led to the Jesuits being driven out of Olomouc at the beginning of the Bohemian Revolt and whole university being closed in the years 1618‚Äì1621. The Faculty of Theology continued to have university privileges, including the right to award university degrees even when the university itself was downgraded to Lyceum in the years 1782‚Äì1827. Following the Habsburg repression of the university in 1860, it was the only functioning faculty up until the re-establishment of the whole University in 1946, together with the University Library safeguarding the continuation between the old and re-established University of Olomouc. The Faculty's name was extended to Saints Cyril and Methodius Faculty of Theology in 1919. It was closed by the Germans in 1939‚Äì1945 with its students and professors being enslaved and deported to work in Germany. It was closed again by the communists in 1950‚Äì1968 and repeatedly in 1974‚Äì1989. While historically the Faculty was preparing future priests, its mission was extended in 1992. The Faculty offers bachelor's degrees and master's degrees in Theology, in Catholic Pedagogy run in collaboration with the Faculty of Education, and in Social and Charitative Work run in collaboration with College of Social Work Olomouc. It also offeres Doctorates of Theology in three fields as well as lifelong learning. In 2000 a student of the Faculty V√°clav Nov√°k uncovered child sex abuse case of Catholic priest Franti≈°ek Merta. Nov√°k also alleged, that the archbishop of Olomouc Jan Graubner was aware of the abuse, but instead of involving the state authorities he covered evidence and introduced policy of transferring abusive priests to different parishes. While Franti≈°ek Merta was convicted, Jan Graubner's involvement has been never substantially proven. V√°clav Nov√°k was later that year kicked out of the Faculty for alleged non-fulfilment of study duties, while Nov√°k asserted that his exclusion is in fact punishment for uncovering Graubner's participation in the child sex abuse case. In the academic year 2010/11 there were students, with a faculty:student ratio of 1:53. As the Czech Republic has one of the least religious populations in the world, the Catholic Church faces lack of Czechs interested in being ordinated as priests. Shortages of Czech priest students and priests both generally and at the Faculty of Theology are balanced by their importation from other countries, foremost from Poland. =Philosophy= The Faculty of Philosophy and the University Art Centre are sited on top of the town's fortification, overseeing a park The Faculty of Philosophy (Faculty of Liberal Arts in the traditional sense) was established three years after the Olomouc College got University rights. Englishman George Warr professed the first lecture on logics on 3 October 1576. From the beginning it was teaching the liberal arts, the Trivium (grammar, rhetoric, dialectics) which led to the Baccalaureus degree, and the Quadrivium (arithmetic, music, geometry and astronomy) which led to the Magister degree. Sharing the fate of Theological faculty in years 1618‚Äì1621, it saw a great revival with not so much the field of philosophy, but the fields of science, mathematics, physics, astronomy, cartography and finally also genetics being pursued by notable persons connected to the Faculty (however these fields are today read at the Faculty of Science). Following the Olomouc University students' participation in 1848 revolution the Faculty of Philosophy was the first one to be suppressed by the Habsurgs in 1851. It was reestablished in 1946. With 1953 establishment of the School of Education of Olomouc the Palack√Ω University Faculty of Philosophy was dissolved until being reopened in 1958. Today its students can study more than 600 combinations See V≈°echny studijn√≠ programy a obory of subjects in the large spectrum of humanities, social sciences, linguistics and arts integration. Some may be studied by distance education, and others are also offered as lifelong learning. The Philosophical Faculty offers bachelor's and master's degrees in Philology of Chinese, Czech, Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Latin, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish and Ukrainian. In the field of languages it further offers degrees on English, French, Dutch, Polish, Russian, Ukrainian and Japanese, all of them with specialization in Applied economics. There are further studies of History, Musicology, Psychology, the Theory and History of the Dramatic Arts, the Theory and History of the Visual Arts, Political Science and European Studies, Euroculture as Erasmus Mundus programme, Adult Education, Philosophy, Sociology, Archives Keeping, Journalism, Social sciences, Jewish studies and many of other programmes. Students who plan to teach at secondary schools can obtain the required qualifications by passing courses in pedagogy and psychology during late part of their study. The Faculty offers doctoral studies in Czech Language, Czech Literature, French Literature, Romance Languages, German Language, German Literature, English and American literature, English Language, Russian Language, Polish Language, History ‚Äì Czech and Slovak history, General History, Auxiliary Historical Sciences, Political Science, Philosophy, Sociology, Clinical Psychology, Educational psychology, Andragogy, Theory of Literature, Theory and History of Literature, Theatre and Film, Theory and History of Fine Arts, Theory and History of Music. The Centre for Distance Learning, together with other departments, offers a wide range of activities for the general public (e.g. courses of graphology, courses for social workers, etc.). In 2011 the faculty had students. In 2010 about people registered for the entrance examinations. The Faculty also provides courses for international students. The Summer School of Slavic Languages has a long tradition and a very good reputation. =Law= Faculty of Law building. Before the Velvet Revolution it was the regional headquarters of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia Faculty's courtroom Although there were attempts in the 1580s to establish also Faculties of Law and Medicine, they failed due to lack of financing. While Canon law was read at the Faculty of Theology since 1667, it was especially the Moravian Nobility, which pursued establishment of secular Professorate of Law in 1679 by a decree of Emperor Leopold I. The first Olomouc professor of law was Karel Ferdinand Irmler. The secular legal studies faced very strong opposition from the Jesuits: initially the professors taught at private premises, while later the lectures were held at the Olomouc Court of Law. Large number of Emperors' interventions was needed to secure continuation of legal studies in following decades. Since 1709 the Olomouc University law professors were appointed directly by the Emperor, in 1714 the Jesuits were forced to accept secular legal lectures within the university grounds. The situation improved after establishment of the Academy of Nobility in 1725 (law professors taught at both the university and academy). In 1732 Olomouc became the first law school in the Habsburg monarchy to teach Fief and Public law at an independent department. Later, in 1755, the lectures were extended to cover also international and natural law. In 1766 the first non-Jesuit University Rector was appointed ‚Äì the professor of law Johann Heinrich B√∂senselle. In the 1760s the Olomouc law school became the centre of the Enlightenment in the Habsburg Monarchy with professor Josef Vratislav Monse as its most important figure facing very strong opposition of the Jesuits. In 1778 the Professorate was elevated to Directorate, and it officially became fully fledged Faculty of Law in 1784, entering its best era before 1848 Revolution. The professors and students of law were the main force of the Revolution in Olomouc. Being forced to shut down by the Habsburg r√©gime at the beginning of study year 1855/1856, it was re-established by the Olomouc University Restoration Act of 1946, however in fact the Faculty could be reopened only following the Velvet Revolution, in 1991. In its new era, the Faculty became one of the pioneers of clinical legal education in the Continental Europe. In 1996 it was the first law school in Central Europe to introduce legal clinics and even now it is the only faculty in the Czech Republic that provides to its students wide range of clinical education. The clinics were quickly expanded and improved, especially after 2006 thanks to a project to advance practical education, which gained financial support from both the Czech national budget and from the European Social Fund. In 2011 there were more than 15 clinical subjects. The Faculty offers four programmes: a five-year-long master's degree in Law and Legal Theory, a three-year-long Bachelor's degree in Legal specialisation aimed at public administration workers, a two-year-long postgraduate master's degree in European studies with focus on European law (offered also as double degree with University of Salzburg Faculty of Law) and a doctorate in Theoretical legal science. The degree (JUDr.) may be also obtained. In 2011, 329 students were accepted to the five-year Law course out of applicants. The bachelor courses accept about 60 students each year, with the European studies program accepting 50. In 2011 students of Law in aggregate totalled ; the student- teacher ratio was 83. =Medicine and Dentistry= Even though the students are enrolled into their respective faculties, they may still choose a lecture from another faculty. The lectures are divided into three categories, A (obligatory), which a student of a given field has to pass; B (facultatory), certain number of which a student has to pass in order to collect enough ECTS-credits; and C (facultatory) which a student may choose to appeal his interest in a different field. Therefore it is possible, for example, for a Law Faculty graduate to have strong knowledge of Biochemistry, if he decides for the C lectures of Faculty of Science. Medical lectures started in 1753 at the Faculty of Philosophy. As the university was relocated to Brno in 1778, the Department of Surgery was established by the Faculty of Philosophy. This department in 1782 became the university's Department of Surgery. The Department of Medicine and Surgery was disaffiliated in 1849 and continued operation independently until it was closed later in 1873. The Faculty was reestablished in 1946. With the Faculty of Law not being actually reopened in the 1950s, the Faculty of Theology being suppressed by the communists in 1950 and with Faculty of Philosophy being closed in 1954, it was the sole faculty of the university from year 1954 to year 1958, in which the Faculty of Philosophy was reestablished while the new Faculty of Science opened. The Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry offers six- year-long Masters programs of General Medicine and five-year-long programs of Dentistry. Both programs may be studied completely either in Czech or English. The faculty also offers 23 doctoral programs in Czech and English. Practical education is carried out mostly at the Olomouc Faculty Hospital. The hospital is with its 1407 beds and 49 departments and clinics (year 2010) the largest one in Olomouc Region. It was established in 1892 and opened four years later. Its Eye Clinic was the place of the world's first successful tissue transplantation in 1905 (performed by Eduard Konrad Zirm). During the years 1992‚Äì2004 it was enlarged and modernised and today it is one of the most modern Czech hospitals. A construction of a new department called BIOMEDREG will begin in 2010. It will focus on cancer and infectious deceases research and treatment and is scheduled to open in 2013. The faculty's long-term research and development focuses on four fields: oncology, heart disease and vein disorders, experimental toxicology and pharmacology, and organ transplants. The research teams focus on molecular biology, immunology and epidemiology. In the academic year 2008/2009 there were students of General Medicine (180 of them studying in English), 450 students of dentistry, and 360 doctoral students. =Education= Faculty of Education building. A new building is planned to be built in front of this. While other Faculties were reestablished by the Olomouc University Restoration Act of 21 February 1946, the Faculty of Education was established by a separate act of April 1946: after a 1945 Bene≈° decree the interim Czechoslovak Parliament passed the law which created educational faculties in existing universities (the ones in other universities were closed by the German occupiers in 1939). Being established 1946 the Faculty of Education was educating future teachers of kindergarten and primary and secondary schools, as well as providing courses for those already teaching. Education of prospective secondary school teachers was done jointly with the Faculty of Philosophy (in the fields of music, drawing and physical arts). 1953 brought complete reform of teacher training methods. The Faculty became the base for the newly established School of Education (separate from the university), so between 1954 and 1964 the Faculty in its former sense did not exist. Teacher training for kindergartens and the first four years of primary education was conducted by the universities, while prospective teachers of years 5‚àí8 of primary schools were educated in specialist higher schools (there was none of this type in Olomouc). In 1960 the so-called \\"Educational Institutes\\" were established to educate prospective primary school teachers. Another reform of 1964 transformed these institutes into Faculties of Education and integrated them into the existing universities. This opened the current period of the Faculty's history. Since 1990 the Faculty has specialised foremost in education of prospective primary- and secondary-school teachers. The Faculty of Education provides tertiary education to prospective teachers of kindergartens, grammar schools, secondary schools and other pedagogical and educational establishments. It also educates public employees of both the government and quango sectors. The Faculty offers Bachelor's degrees, Master's degrees and Doctorates of Philosophy, as well as appointing Professors. In 2011 there were students of the faculty; the number of freshmen was and there were 1347 graduates; there were also students of other forms of education forms such as lifelong learning. The faculty has a student-teacher ratio of 184.1. =Science= Faculty of Science main building The fields of science, mathematics, physics, astronomy, cartography as well as genetics were pursued already by notable persons connected to the old Olomouc University's Faculty of Philosophy. In 1953 the Olomouc School of Education was established with Faculty of Social Sciences and Faculty of Natural Sciences. The latter one was in 1958 incorporated into the university as the Faculty of Science. The Faculty of Science is oriented to research and offers Bachelor's degrees, Master's degrees and Doctorates of Philosophy in various fields such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, Earth sciences, and so on. Since 2009 the faculty has residence in a new building not far from the city center, between the Faculty of Law and the university halls of residence. The biology workshops and some laboratories are situated on their own small campus at the south-east edge of the city. In 2009 there were students studying at the faculty; the number of freshmen was while there were 713 graduates. The faculty has 333 academic employees and other 600 non-academic workers. =Physical Culture= The Faculty of Physical Culture was established in 1991. It has many different programmes, including education of prospective teachers of physical education (PE), Physical therapy, recreation and public security. These may be studied in three-year-long Bachelor's and 2-year-long postgraduate Master's programmes. The faculty also has the doctoral program of Kinanthropology. Its research efforts focus in fields of issues and prevention of physical, mental and sociological health of a man in relation to physical activities; basic problems of the human motor system, its diagnosis and improvement; methodological problems of education of PE; development of new fields and finding solutions issues of specific fields. With the Ne≈ôed√≠n hall of residence (used mostly by foreign students) the Faculty's buildings constitute a small campus on the western outskirts of the city. In 2011 there were students at the faculty; the number of freshmen was 873 while there were 367 graduates. =Health Sciences= The Faculty of Health Sciences was founded in 2008, and so it is the youngest of the eight faculties. It was established by spinning off some fields from the Faculty of Medicine. Since 1992 the Faculty of Medicine had offered bachelor programmes of Nursing and Therapeutic Rehabilitation and Physiotherapy. In 1996 the Institute of Nursing Practice and Theory was established at the faculty. This act of separation was supported by Virginia Commonwealth University and led to the empowerment of the field. Since 2000 the Masters program of Economics and Management of Health Services has been taught. In 2002 other fields were added such as Obstetric Assistant. In 2003 a vice-dean for these fields was appointed for the first time. In 2006 the faculty's structure changed by the creation of the Center of Health (Non-Physician) Fields, which later became the base for the Faculty of Health Sciences. In 2011 there were 815 students at the faculty. Facilities =Academic Sports Centre= The Academic Sports Centre offers sports, excursions, and other activities for University students and employees. The offer covers dozens of fields from yoga, dance, callanetics, firearms shooting, and martial arts to team sports, paintball, equestrianism and golf. There are several University buildings provided for these activities. The University Sports Hall meets Olympic Games requirements for volleyball, basketball and handball matches. The whole complex of outdoor sports grounds together with the university docks appertain to the hall. Another gymnasium is at the buildings of the Faculty of Physical Culture (on the Ne≈ôed√≠n campus), and another is next to the Olomouc Hockey Stadium. Others are within halls of residence. University sport championships are not major events in the Czech Republic as they are in the United States for example. So many students' sporting life is connected more with Olomouc town (especially when it comes to supporting a team); different Olomouc sport clubs play in national and international leagues, such SK Sigma Olomouc and 1. HFK Olomouc (football), HC Olomouc (ice hockey), and Skokani Olomouc (baseball). =Centre for Information Technologies= The Centre for Information Technologies (IT) leads the development of, and safeguards the operational security of, University IT activities to support science and research activities, lectures and university administration. It is also responsible for implementing modern technologies and technical support as well as training University employees in their use. Most University buildings have free Wi-Fi, while nearly every dormitory room has a high speed wired LAN connection. =University Library= The Research Library in Olomouc main building The library was established as the Jesuits were invited to Olomouc in 1566 to take control over the Olomouc College. Its bookstock consisted primarily of donations from bishops and noblemen. Particular generosity was shown by Vil√©m Prusinovsk√Ω z V√≠ckova, the Bishop of Olomouc, who gave the college to the Jesuits and allowed them to take for it any Greek or Latin books from the episcopal library. The Swedish occupation of Olomouc from 1642 to 1650 led to total ruination of the library. Everything that had any value was stolen (including codices made under the patronage of the Bishop of Olomouc Jind≈ôich Zd√≠ka), while the rest was destroyed. Altogether some 100 wagons fully loaded with books and scripts were dispatched to Sweden. As a result, Olomouc University's most precious relics are now in the National Library of Sweden in Stockholm. The library was nevertheless restored relatively rapidly after the Swedes left. Under the Jesuits the library was open only to the university's lecturers and students. Following the dissolution of the order in 1773 it was reconstituted as the Public University Library, with the stress on more widely shared access. At the same time library funds from Moravian Jesuit Colleges that had been closed down were transferred to Olomouc University Library. Later on, funds from dissolved monasteries also found their way into the same budget. The library continued in operation, together with the Faculty of Theology, after the university was closed down in 1860: this has ensured some continuity between the old and re-established universities in Olomouc. When the university was closed, the library held over 250,000 volumes. Then, the library's responsibilities included holding a copy of everything printed in Moravia (and for part of the period in Silesia). This would support the rapid and efficient development of scientific work after the re-establishment of university in 1946. Initially, in 1946 the University Library remained under the direct control of Ministry of Culture. It was renamed the Research Library in Olomouc in 1960 and placed under regional control, it retained, and still retains, the function of a public University Library. It is still administered separately from the university. Nowadays the University Library itself is divided between the Central Library and a series of specialist libraries, most of them attached to the appropriate university faculty. Central Library (Armoury) The Palack√Ω University Central Library, known as the Armoury The Armoury courtyard The Central Library, known as the Armoury (), is situated in the historic building of the former Theresian Artillery armoury almost in the town centre, directly in front of the Archbishop's Palace and next to the university Rectory and Philosophy Faculty. In the Campaigns of 1742, the Habsburg Monarchy lost most of Silesia and K≈Çodzko (now in Poland) which were both Lands under the Czech Crown prior to 1742. Olomouc suddenly found itself close to the frontier with Prussia. The Empress Maria Theresa therefore decided to fortify the town. Olomouc's fortifications were extensively upgraded to match contemporary weapons. The artillery armoury became part of the fortification. Military considerations received absolute priority, and the Armoury was built right next to the Archbishop's palace: ecclesiastical buildings (such as the former Academy of Noblemen) were even demolished to make space for it. Construction of the Armoury was completed in 1771. Strictly symmetrical both inside and out, the building is relatively large, featuring the military architecture characteristic of the period. Today the armoury is recognized as one of the most important buildings in Olomouc. The Armoury was used by the military until 1989 (the Czech Army Joint Forces still have their headquasters in Olomouc today). After the Velvet Revolution, the armoury became the property of the university: it was then decided to accommodate the information centre in it. However, the building was in very poor condition and needed extensive reconstruction. Reconstruction started in 1992 and in 1997 the Central Library opened. However, it was not until 2000 that the building works were finished and the whole building could be opened. The Central Library occupies about half of the Armoury, while the rest is occupied by the Centre for Information Technologies, the University Press, the University Archive and the Eurocentre. Other libraries The Saints Cyril and Methodius Faculty of Theology and the Faculties of Medicine, Science, Education, Physical Culture, Law, and Health Sciences each have their own libraries; the Faculty of Education's is called the Study Hall. The British Centre LibrarySee is housed on the university grounds and run by the British Council. =Project service= The University Project Service is an information and consultancy centre which assists those wishing to obtain grants and donations. It also manages administrative and financial aspects of given projects and it lectures on the topic. =Halls of Residence Bureau= Ne≈ôed√≠n halls of residence. Before the Velvet Revolution it was a barracks for Soviet occupiers The Halls of Residence Bureau offers year-round accommodation and boarding for students, university employees and also for the general public (when there is spare capacity). Especially during the summer months, when most students vacate dormitories, it offers accommodation and boarding for both individual tourists and large groups (conferences, sports championships, and so on). The halls of residence have more than beds, while the boarding services are used by more than people daily. There are rooms with one single bed, or two or three of them; some rooms are equipped with double beds. Most of the halls of residence are either close to the city centre (by the new Faculty of Science building) or on the outskirts, at the Ne≈ôed√≠n campus of Faculty of Physical Culture, while there are some buildings in other parts of town. Internet connections, intranet telephone lines, kitchens, study rooms and washing machines are standard equipment. Compared to other Czech universities, the student-bed ratio is relatively low (there are usually more beds than students). Although for the first couple of weeks of an academic year all beds are taken, within a month or two there are free beds. Therefore, the university can accommodate almost all those who want them, whereas many other Czech universities can provide room only for freshmen. Many students prefer to rent flats, because the rents are about the same as for halls of residence. As the university is self-governing, and halls of residence are part of the university, there is also the Halls of Residence Council. Students in halls vote for representatives (usually one for each building) to safeguard their rights. For example, the Halls of Residence Bureau needs the council's approval in case of price increase, or if it wants to evict a student for order disturbances. =Science and Technology Park= The Science and Technology Park aims to bridge the gap between the academical-scientific world and private business, to use the university research potential in cooperation with private companies. It also helps starting entrepreneurs through its Business Incubator. Special attention is paid to fields of nanotechnology, biotechnology and information technology. It also manages the catalogue of university apparatus and services to make it accessible to private companies. =University Press= The University Press focuses especially on publishing the scientific and research activities of the university. It publishes and distributes works on subjects which are too specialized or have too narrow reader constituency to appeal to commercial publishers, as well as publishing study books, study texts and professional journals. In 2009 it had 28 employees and published 252 new releases and 343 other releases. =Confucius Institute= The Confucius Institute provides Chinese schooling.For more information, see It follows in the footsteps of Karel Slav√≠ƒçek (1678‚Äì1735), alumnus of the Faculty of Philosophy, who was the first Czech sinologist. He wrote a treatise on Chinese music and was also the author of the first precise map of Beijing. Governance There are three basic types of university with different level of state control in the Czech Republic. All of them need state accreditation to award university degrees. *Public Universities are financed mostly by the state, yet are independent and self-governed. *State Universities have very limited self- governance, typically they are not even legal personalities, formally they are components of state administration units. There are only two of them in the Czech republic ‚Äì the Universities of the Ministries of Defence and of the Interior *Private Universities need only accreditation, otherwise they are free from state control, as well as from state financing. Czech universities have a long tradition of self-governance and independence from state interference, which goes back to the Middle Ages. Today, self- governance is assured by the University Education Act No. 111/1998 (the Act deals only with public universities).Obecn√© spr√°vn√≠ pr√°vo, Vladim√≠r Sl√°deƒçek, 2nd edition, ASPI Praha 2009 The following governance bodies are similar for all Czech public universities. =Academical Senate= The Academical Senate of a Czech public university is its self-governance representative body. According to the law it shall have at least eleven members, with at least one third and at most one half of its members being students. The Palack√Ω University Academical Senate has twenty-four members, of which eight are students, the minimum of one third. Senators are elected by secret ballot for a period of three years. The students' and lecturers' curia are elected separately. Each faculty is represented by two lecturers and one student (independent of the number of faculty students). The Academical Senate has the most important role in the life of the university, as most acts of other university administration are either governed by rules and regulations adopted by the Senate (such as the Statute of university) or require the approval of the Senate (such as the yearly budget of the university). The Senate adopts internal regulations, it controls the use of university finances and property, and following the rector's proposal it appoints and dismisses members of the Scientific Board, Disciplinary Commission, and so on. The Senate also nominates a candidate for the position of rector (who is appointed by the president of the Czech Republic). The nomination must be agreed by a simple majority of all senators, while a dismissal must be agreed by at least three fifths of all senators. The vote to elect or repeal a rector is secret, while other Senate votes are open. A senator may not also be the rector, vice- rector, a faculty dean or a vice-dean. The 2011‚Äì2014 leadership is: * Chairman: doc. Mgr. Miroslav Dopita, PhD (Faculty of Education representative; lecturers' curia) * Vice-chairman (lecturers' curia): RNDr. Marek Jukl, PhD (Faculty of Science representative) * Vice-chairman (students' curia): Ivan Kalivoda (Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry representative) See The Palack√Ω Academical Senate has also two commissions: the Economic Commission and the Legislative Commission. =Rector= Inauguration of Lubom√≠r Dvo≈ô√°k, 1997‚Äì2000 and 2006‚Äì2010 Palack√Ω University Rector The Rector is the head of the university. The Rector acts in the name of the university and decides the university's affairs unless prohibited by law. The Rector is nominated by the University Academical Senate and appointed by the President of the Czech Republic. The term of office is four years and a person may hold it for at most two consecutive terms. The rector appoints vice-rectors, who act as deputies to the extent the rector determines. Rectors' salaries are determined directly by the Minister of Education. The first rector was in 1573 Hurtado P√©rez. Until 1765, the position of Rector Magnificus was automatically in the hands of the rector of Jesuit Order. The first non-jesuit Rector was in 1766 Johann Heinrich B√∂senselle. Among the most notable rectors are the founder of modern Moravian historiography Josef Vratislav Monse or Slovenian philosopher Franz Samuel Karpe. In 1950, Palack√Ω University became the first Czech university to have a female Rector ‚Äì Ji≈ôina Popelov√°. The current rector is Professor Jaroslav Miller. He has appointed seven vice-rectors, one of them being the previous rector: Professor Lubom√≠r Dvo≈ô√°k (now vice-rector for regional development). =Scientific Board= The Scientific Board consists of notable representatives in the fields in which the university executes educational, scientific, research, artistic or other creative activity. It is chaired by the university rector. No more than two-thirds of the board members can be members of the university's academical community. The Scientific Board discusses the university's long-term objectives. It approves study programmes (unless such approval falls under the authority of a faculty Scientific Board) and it also participates in the process of assigning a professor title. In July 2010, the board had 36 members, 22 of them being professors, the rest (except one) being docents.For a full list of the Scientific Board Members, see =Disciplinary Commission= The members of the University Disciplinary Commission (as well as the chairman) are appointed by the rector (subject to Senate approval) to serve for two years. Half the members are students. Because all Palack√Ω University students are enrolled into their respective faculties, there is no need for a central University Disciplinary Commission, but there are Disciplinary Commissions at each faculty (the members being appointed by a dean, subject to Faculty Senate approval). The Disciplinary Commissions handle disciplinary misdemeanours of the students and they propose the verdicts to the respective faculty Dean.For details concerning disciplinary misdemeanors and Disciplinary Commission rules, see =Administrative Council= The Administrative Council approves some of the university deeds (real estate transactions, establishing other legal personalities for the university, the transfer of money or property between them, and so on) and it gives its opinion on the university budget, long-term University objectives, and so on. Members are appointed by the Minister of Education (after discussion with the rector) for a period of six years; one third of the council is appointed every two years. Members represent the general public, municipal and regional authorities as well as state administration. University employees cannot be Council members. Sessions take place at least twice a year. Election of the chairman, vice-chairman and rules of procedure are set by the University StatuteSee Among the fifteen members of Palack√Ω University Administrative Council are Jan B≈ôezina MEP, Archbishop of Olomouc Jan Graubner, and Olomouc Region Governor Martin Tesa≈ô√≠k.For a full list of Administrative Council Members, see =Bursar= The Bursar is responsible for the management and administration of the university and also represents the university to the extent determined by the rector, who appoints and revokes the Bursar. As of July 2010 the office is held by Henrieta Crko≈àov√°. =Other bodies= * University Chancellor: Rostislav Sladk√Ω * Rector's advisory board * Editorial Commission * Commission for Information Technologies * Ethical Commission =Faculty governance= The faculties are parts of the university. Only the university as a whole is a legal personality. Nevertheless, the internal affairs of faculties are run by their respective self-governing bodies, which have similar rules and functions as those at the university level. Each faculty therefore has a Faculty Senate (also with students' and lecturers' curia), which among other things nominates the Dean (appointed by the rector). As mentioned before, disciplinary misdemeanours are tried by the Faculty Disciplinary Commissions, while issues concerning study programmes are dealt with by the Faculty Scientific Boards. Each faculty has a secretary instead of a bursar.

The gentle curve of the grandstand is a compromise to watching football games, and creates a large foul territory for baseball. Gill Stadium is a sporting stadium located in Manchester, New Hampshire. It is one of the oldest concrete-and-steel ballparks in the United States. The venue, which mainly hosts amateur baseball and football contests, has a capacity of 3,012.  Beech Street Grounds  Children and organized amateur teams had played baseball since at least 1880 in the area east of the Valley Cemetery, which was known as \\"the Plains.\\" A ballpark called the Beech Street Grounds was built on the site of Gill Stadium at the corner of Beech and Valley Streets, on land owned by the Amoskeag Manufacturing Company. The park had a wooden fence and two wooden grandstands. Its main entrance was located on Beech Street. This was near third base, and home plate was in the field's southwest corner.Scott C. Roper and Stephanie Abbot Roper, When Baseball Met Big Bill Haywood: The Battle for Manchester, New Hampshire, 1912‚Äì1916, McFarland and Company, Publishers, Inc., Jefferson NC, 2018. Baseball was played there between 1891 and 1894. In its first two years, the park was home to a minor-league baseball team, the Manchester Amoskeags of the New England League.  Varick Park  In 1894, local businessman Thomas Varick purchased an interest in the park, moved the two grandstands and designated one as men-only, constructed a 40-foot-wide, quarter-mile dirt bicycle and running track, and renamed the complex Varick Park. The baseball diamond was reoriented so that home plate was along the west (Beech Street) side of the field and the entrance was off Valley Street. As well as baseball, the park hosted track-and-field events, football and soccer games, and outdoor events for Amoskeag. During the 1890s, control of Varick Park passed from Varick to William Freeman. The park was again home to several minor-league baseball teams in the New England League called the Manchester Amoskeags in 1891, the Manchesters in 1899, and the Manchester Textiles in 1906.  Textile Field  In June 1912, Amoskeag officials began negotiations with Freeman to take control of the park for use by the city manufacturers' baseball league. In December 1912, Amoskeag announced that the field had been renamed Textile Field and that it would be reoriented and completely rebuilt as a modern, brick-and-concrete baseball facility. The current grandstand was built in 1913 at a cost of more than $30,000. It was designed by Amoskeag engineers using brick in the style and color of the mills in Amoskeag's millyard, and built by the Amoskeag Textile Club, which was funded by Amoskeag and whose members were Amoskeag employees. A single, covered grandstand was built, gently curved to provide for watching either baseball or football. For safety, concrete ramps were constructed along the sides and rear of the grandstand. Steel trusses and posts supported the roof. Although portions of the roof, floor, and some of the posts supporting the seating platform were of wood, publications from the period of construction ‚Äî including Amoskeag's employee newspaper, the Amoskeag Bulletin ‚Äî considered it \\"fireproof\\", like those being built in major-league cities between 1909 and 1915. Textile Field was one of the first concrete-and- steel stadiums in the United States, the first not in a major city. Only Harvard Stadium in Allston, Massachusetts (1903), Rickwood Field in Birmingham, Alabama (1910), and Fenway Park in Boston, Massachusetts (1912) are older surviving examples. The construction appears to have been part of Amoskeag's benevolence programs. Amoskeag, which employed about 17,000 people in a city of 65,000, included among its workforce a large number of immigrants. In the minds of Amoskeag managers, the most troublesome of this group were the most recent arrivals from Greece. Recent immigrants from southern and eastern Europe were being blamed for the 1912 Bread and Roses Strike in nearby Lawrence, Massachusetts, which resulted in much violence and the involvement of the radical Industrial Workers of the World union. Amoskeag, which was not unionized, wanted no such trouble, particularly in light of the fact that IWW operatives were seen in Manchester during the Lawrence strike. The company hoped to find a way to \\"Americanize\\" its workforce, thereby giving workers a stronger connection to the company and to the United States, and to find diversionary activities, like baseball, to keep them from unionizing in their free time. Amoskeag, along with the McElwain Shoe Company and other industries in Manchester, organized the city Manufacturers' League in 1912. The league played at three locations in Manchester, of which Varick Park was the most important. Its reconstruction in 1913 as Textile Field made the league seem more professional. Textile Field made its debut over Memorial Day weekend of 1913, but the grandstand was not entirely completed until late July. The dedication game came on September 8, when the World Champion Boston Red Sox ‚Äî playing its major-league lineup for nearly the entire game ‚Äî defeated the Manufacturers' League All-Stars, 3-1. A year later, the World Champion Philadelphia Athletics defeated the All-Stars, 7-1. The score and the \\"vaudeville\\" act put on by the Athletics in the final inning ‚Äî in which they changed positions and performed \\"trick\\" plays ‚Äî made Amoskeag reconsider its commitment. Increased on- and off-field problems with players, who were hired ostensibly to work for the textile company but in reality were employed for their baseball skills, also led the Textile Club to withdraw its support for the Manufacturers League. A team from the New England League moved from Fitchburg, Massachusetts to Textile Field in July 1914 as the Manchester Textiles. It played there in 1915 as well. Thereafter, Textile Field became the sole domain of the city's manufacturers and schools until 1926. In September 1923, Amoskeag brought in the National League's Brooklyn Robins (now known as the Los Angeles Dodgers) to play against the company team.  Athletic Field  Textile Field was purchased by the City of Manchester in 1927 and, in a name-the-field contest conducted by the Manchester Union-Leader, renamed Athletic Field. Athletic Field hosted three professional teams of the New England League: The Manchester Blue Sox played there from 1926‚Äì1930, winning championships in 1926 and 1929, but the league folded in mid-1930. The Manchester Giants, affiliated with the New York Giants, made the post-season in 1946 and 1947; and the Manchester Yankees, affiliated with the New York Yankees, played there in 1948 but disbanded on July 19, 1949 for financial reasons.  Gill Stadium  The view of Gill Stadium from the south (across Valley Street). This 2004 photo shows the construction of the elevator to the rooftop press box. A temporary poster describing the renovations is attached to the ticket booth. In 1967, the stadium was renamed Gill Stadium, after former Parks and Recreation Director Ignace J. Gill, who served from 1935 to 1967. In 1971 and 1972, an Eastern League (class A) team, also called the Yankees, played there. Additionally, the Eastern League's Nashua Angels played a game at Gill Stadium in 1983. The stadium was renovated extensively in preparation for the inaugural 2004 baseball season of the Eastern League's New Hampshire Fisher Cats (the class AA affiliate of the Toronto Blue Jays), acquiring an aluminum floor and molded plastic chairs, new clubhouses adjacent to the grandstand, and dugouts in what was formerly the dirt track. An elevator provided handicapped access to the rooftop press box. The grass surface was replaced with FieldTurf and the ticket booth and lavatories were renovated. The Fisher Cats brought the 2004 Eastern League title home to Gill. In 2005, a new municipal baseball stadium ‚Äî now known as Northeast Delta Dental Stadium ‚Äî was completed along the Merrimack River near downtown, and the Fisher Cats made their scheduled move there. Over the years, Gill Stadium has served as the home field for city high-school and American Legion ball clubs. The stadium hosted the American Legion World Series on five occasions. Gill Stadium continues to host numerous amateur baseball teams, and Manchester's annual Thanksgiving football tournament, the Turkey Bowl, which pits two of the four city schools against each other each year based on their performance during the just-completed season. On-site parking comprises 300 spaces, accessible from Beech Street. Additional parking may be available just north at the adjacent John F. Kennedy Memorial Coliseum, or on side streets.

The Chukar has gone through three major revisions, including the initial MQM-74A Chukar I, the MQM-74C Chukar II, and the BQM-74C Chukar III. They are recoverable, remote controlled, subsonic aerial target, capable of speeds up to Mach 0.86 and altitudes from 30 to 40,000 ft (10 to 12,000 m). Description The BQM-74E is propelled during flight by a single Williams J400 (J400-WR-404) turbojet engine, which produces a maximum thrust of 240 pounds force (1068 N) at sea level. The BQM-74 is launched from a zero length ground launcher utilizing dual Jet Assisted Takeoff (JATO) bottles. When equipped with an air launch kit, the BQM-74 can be air launched from a TA-4J, F-16, Grumman Gulfstream I or DC-130 aircraft. The BQM-74 is used primarily as a realistic aerial target, capable of simulating enemy threats for gunnery and missile training exercises. Drones are capable of being recovered following a training exercise. A parachute is deployed by remote control or if the remote control link is severed and a flotation kit can be added for sea-based recovery. If recovery of the drone is required, special telemetry warheads are used on the defensive missile in place of explosives. This telemetry warhead is desirable since it allows for extensive analysis of the performance of the defensive missile, including miss distance information that determines if a real warhead would have damaged the target. A direct hit would likely destroy the drone. Gunnery systems would use non-explosive dummy munitions. Since gunnery systems are aimed in front of a moving target so it will fly through the blast-fragments, dummy munitions do not have to directly hit a target. Analysis of radar data would determine if actual explosive munitions would have damaged the target drone. Development =MQM-74A Chukar I= The Chukar series began in the early 1960s with a US Navy requirement for a new target drone. The company developed a prototype with the company designation of NV-105 and featuring a delta wing, flying it in 1964. The delta wing didn't work out and was replaced by a straight wing, resulting in the NV-105A, which was first flown in 1965. The NV-105A was accepted by the Navy and went into production as the MQM-74A in 1968. A U.S. Navy MQM-74A launch, 1972. The MQM-74A had a neatly tapered cigar-shaped fuselage, straight mid-mounted wings, an underslung jet engine with the intake under the wings, and a conventional tail configuration with the tailplanes set in an inverted vee. It was powered by a Williams International WR24-6 turbojet engine with a thrust of 121 pounds (538 N), and was launched by RATO booster from the ground or a ship. The Navy purchased 1,800 MQM-74A Chukar Is. Several hundred more were purchased in total by NATO for a multinational test range on the island of Crete, as well as the Royal Navy and the Italian Navy. Chukar is the name of an Asian species of partridge, introduced to America and as they are hunted for sport, it seems that Northrop felt that the name was appropriate for an aircraft whose purpose in life is to be shot at. The name Chukar is only formally applied to export versions of the drone, but informally it is used for all variants. =XBQM-108= In the mid-1970s, the US Naval Weapons Center used the MQM-74A as the basis for an experimental drone designated the XBQM-108, which was to be used to as a demonstrator for a \\"pogo\\" or \\"tailsitter\\" aircraft that could take off and land straight up and down on its tail. The fuselage, tailfin, radio control system, and parachute recovery system of the MQM-74A were retained, but the drone was fitted with a new wing, a Teledyne CAE J402 engine with a rotating vectored thrust exhaust, fixed tricycle landing gear, and additional flight control systems. The demonstrator was completed and was making tethered flights when the program was canceled. =MQM-74C Chukar II= MQM-74C Chukar II floating and being recovered. The Navy liked the Chukar I but wanted a somewhat faster version, and in the early 1970s Northrop developed the improved experimental MQM-74B, which was followed by the production MQM-74C Chukar II. The Chukar II is difficult to distinguish from the Chukar I, but the Chukar II is slightly scaled up and uses an uprated Williams WR24-7 turbojet with 180 pound (800 N) thrust, giving it a top speed of 590 mph (950 km/h). Like the Chukar I, the Chukar II is ground or ship launched only. At least 1,400 Chukar IIs were built, mostly for the US Navy, but other customers included NATO, the United Kingdom, West Germany, Greece, Iran, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, and Spain. =BQM-74C Chukar III= In 1978, the US Navy requested a still more sophisticated drone, and Northrop responded with the BQM-74C Chukar III. This improved variant is visibly different from its predecessors, featuring a more cylindrical fuselage, in contrast with the tapered fuselage of its predecessors. The BQM-74C incorporates a microprocessor-based autopilot that allows it to be programmed for much more sophisticated flight operations. The BQM-74C can be air launched as well as ground launched. The original engine was the Williams WR24-7A AKA J400-WR-402, with 180 pound (800 N) thrust, but in 1986 production was upgraded to the J400-WR-403 with 240 pound (1070 N) thrust. The BQM-74C is stressed for maneuvers of up to 6Gs. More than 1,600 BQM-74Cs have been built. Northrop built ten BQM-74C Recce UAVs for tactical reconnaissance for US Navy evaluation, but this variant did not go into production. =BQM-74E Chukar III= The BQM-74C has now been replaced in production by the BQM-74E, which is externally all but identical but incorporates the uprated J400-WR-404 engine as standard, and has a third greater range and endurance than its predecessor. On 6 January 2015 PHT, Filipino fishermen recovered a drone of this kind floating off in the waters near Patnanungan, Quezon Province, Philippines. Jonas Cabiles Soltes, \\"US-made drone falls in Masbate waters\\", inquirer.net (Online news site of the Philippine Daily Inquirer), 7 January 2013 The US Embassy in Manila said that the drone was actually fired four months earlier during American naval exercises off Guam and was just washed ashore in the Philippines through ocean currents. The country's Department of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Raul Hernandez appeared to support the US Embassy explanation, adding that at no time was the aerial target drone launched nor did it fly or crash within the Philippine territory. Human rights groups and even left-wing inclined groups/organizations have either condemned, criticized or called for an investigation regarding the incident, saying that drones can be used for surveillance and they can be used for actual combat operations, as well as suggesting it is used on spying on activities of the communist New People's Army as part of counterinsurgency efforts. However, Maj. Harold Cabunoc, spokesperson of the Philippine Army, denied that drones were taking part in the fight against rebels.Tarra Quismundo, Jonas Cabiles Soltes and Mar Arguelles, \\"DFA backs US claim drone fired in Guam 4 months ago\\", inquirer.net (Online news site of the Philippine Daily Inquirer), 8 January 2013 =Future versions= In the 1980s, Northrop built a next-generation target, the NV-144, that was substantially bigger and faster than the Chukar III, but the NV-144 did not enter production. The latest and current effort by Northrop Grumman to improve the Chukar is the BQM-74F variant of the Chukar (previously called the Target 2000). The BQM-74F has general configuration along the lines of the BQM-74C, but features swept wings, an empty weight of 600 pounds (270 kilograms), an uprated engine with 300 pound (1.33 kN) thrust, speed of up to Mach 0.93, and a design lifetime of 20 flights. The BQM-74F will be able to simulate a range of different aircraft and cruise missiles. It will also be able to tow targets and decoys, and will be compatible with current Chukar support systems and infrastructure. The Navy awarded Northrop Grumman a development contract in 2002, and the first BQM-74F was unveiled on August 22, 2005, with its first flight taking place seven days later at the naval air station in Point Mugu, California.http://www.wmof.com/bqm74.htmhttps://news.northropgrumman.com/news/releases/northrop- grumman-and-u-s-navy-successfully-conduct-first-flight-of-navy-s-most- advanced-aerial-target Persian Gulf War combat use In the 1991 Persian Gulf War, BQM-74Cs were used as decoys during the initial air attacks into Iraq. The USAF Big Safari group was put in charge of the decoy effort, which was codenamed \\"Project Scathe Mean\\". The Chukar drones that were available were usually launched from DC-130 director aircraft, and could also be launched from strike aircraft such as F-15s or F-16s. These launch resources were not available though, so the Navy found twelve ground launchers in their inventory that could be made serviceable, while RATO booster units were found stockpiled in Belgium. Each BQM-74C was fitted with a pair of corner reflectors to enhance its radar signature to imitate a manned aircraft. A 40-person team of specialists, obtained from disbanded ground-launched cruise missile units (see 868th Tactical Missile Training Squadron), was assembled in a few days and designated the \\"4468th Tactical Reconnaissance Group\\". The 4468th TRG moved quickly, with trucks modified and obtained from a California commercial trucking firm, tool kits purchased from Sears, and field gear bought from war surplus stores. The teams were given quick training, equipped with 44 Navy BQM-74Cs, and sent to Saudi Arabia in two six-launcher teams in about two weeks, arriving near the Iraqi border on 15 October 1990. The northern team was sited to cover Baghdad and large military bases in that area, while the southern team was sited to cover Basra and Kuwait City. When the Gulf War air campaign began on the night of 17 January 1991, Iraq was hit by attack waves of Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighters and BGM-109 Tomahawk cruise missiles. A group of 38 BQM-74Cs were assigned to be launched as diversion for the second wave of attacks, with the launches generally in groups of three, and 37 were launched successfully in precisely timed waves. One group of three was intercepted by Iraqi aircraft, while all the others made it to target. The drones flew over 500 kilometers (310 miles) at 630 km/h (390 mph), then began to circle Baghdad for up to 20 minutes. Iraqi air defense radars which probed for the drones were engaged by allied strike aircraft firing AGM-88 HARMs (High-speed Anti-Radiation Missiles). The Navy also launched ADM-141 TALDs (Tactical Air Launched Decoys) to contribute to the countermeasures blitz. Iraqi air defenses never recovered from this blow, and though large Allied aircraft losses had been predicted, the Iraqis only succeeded in shooting down 44 manned aircraft. After the war, the 4468th was disbanded, and one of the remaining BQM-74Cs was donated to the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson AFB in Ohio, where it is now on display. USS Chancellorsville accident On 16 November 2013, a BQM-74E hit and damaged the , slightly injuring two sailors and making a hole in the superstructure just above the deck. The drone was supposed to turn away more than a mile from the cruiser during exercises to test the latest version of the Aegis Combat System, but instead carried straight on into the ship.

He was voiced by the actor Richard E. Grant. Overview Scream of the Shalka was designed to be an official continuation of Doctor Who. At the time, there were no plans for a continuation of the television series and plans for another film were progressing very slowly. The Shalka Doctor was intended to be the ninth incarnation, as two lines in Scream of the Shalka imply: the Doctor mentions that Andy Warhol once wanted to paint \\"all nine\\" of him, and comments that a dead cat has used up its nine lives, like he has. The Shalka Doctor's claim to being the \\"Ninth Doctor\\" was also backed up by BBC press releases.BBC-written copy for the release of the novelisation of Shalka\\"Net premi√®re for Dr Who\\"/ BBC News. 12 November 2003 However, the 2005 series was announced in September 2003‚Äîabout two months before the webcast could meet its 13 November release date.http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3140786.stm \\"Doctor Who returns to TV\\". BBC News. 26 September 2003. This led to immediate controversy about the \\"official\\" status of the animated Ninth Doctor. Martin Trickey, executive producer of The Scream of the Shalka, noted these concerns when he was interviewed at the time of Shalka's release: \\"The BBC said it was the ninth Doctor, so that's great. Is it part of the canon? I don't know. There's a big argument raging on the message board. I just hope people enjoy it. That's the main thing. Whether people choose to see it as the official Ninth Doctor or not is really up to them.\\" As of 2005, Christopher Eccleston was established as the definitive Ninth Doctor, with BBC press releases, advertisements, and episode material have firmly established Eccleston as \\"the Ninth Doctor\\". To date the Shalka Doctor has appeared in four officially licensed Doctor Who products: the original webcast, the novelisation of the webcast by Paul Cornell which was released by BBC Books, the DVD release and the short story \\"The Feast of the Stone\\" by Cavan Scott and Mark Wright which has to date only been published on the BBC's \\"Cult Vampire Magazine\\" webpage. A further series was commissioned by the BBC. It was called \\"Blood of the Robots\\" and was being written by Simon Clark. Three episodes had been written before it was cancelled because of the imminent return of the live series. Appearance and characterisation The Doctor is visually modelled on Grant himself.Extract of contemporary interview with Richard E. Grant Grant has described his interpretation of the Doctor as \\"Sherlock Holmes in space.\\" The Shalka Doctor has an aristocratic bearing. He is resentful of an unseen power directing his travels. He refuses, at first, to intervene in the Shalka invasion of the village of Lannet until the death of a homeless woman raises his ire, and is abrasive with the military characters who ally with him in the Shalka story. He seems haunted by some undisclosed past event, to the point where he actively opposes the notion of Alison becoming a companion. The android which contains the consciousness of the Master (voiced by Derek Jacobi) hints that the Doctor's previous companion may have met an untimely end.

It is on Lake Nipissing and is part of the Almaguin Highlands region. Nipissing was surveyed between 1874 and 1881, and was incorporated in 1888. Among the first settlers in the area were the Chapman and Beatty families. Nipissing Township annexed Gurd Township in 1970. The township also contains a community named Nipissing, which is located on the South River near Chapman's Landing, on the South Bay of Lake Nipissing. The township administrative offices are located in Nipissing. The township includes the communities of Alsace, Christian Valley, Commanda, Hotham, Nipissing and Wade's Landing. History The founder of Nipissing, John Beattie (John Beatty) arrived by canoe from Eganville in 1862. He was looking for land suitable for settlement. To lay claim to the property, he made brush piles, and was granted free land by the Government of Ontario. Around 1869 James Chapman and his wife, Phoebe Edwards, built their first house and barn at the top of the chutes that later took their name. The family farmed the area and James carried the mail by canoe, dog team and later horse on a route stretching between the villages of Magnetawan and Mattawa. The Chapman Valley and Chapman Township near Magnetawan are named after the family. James and Phoebe are among the pioneers buried in the Nipissing village cemetery. The Chapman family donated the land to the municipal government, and the landing became a municipal boat launch, public dock and swimming hole for village children. Originally supplies were brought into Nipissing from Pembroke by canoe over the Champlain Trail, as well as the South River. Nipissing village became the main route for shipping supplies. Around 1875 a colonization road was completed which connected tiny Nipissing village to Rosseau near Parry Sound in the south and this created road travel and another route for shipment of supplies. An Ontario Historical Plaque was erected at the Nipissing Township Museum by the province to commemorate the Rosseau-Nipissing Road's role in Ontario's heritage. However, in 1886 the Northern and Pacific Junction Railway connected Gravenhurst to Callander cutting out Nipissing village from its main route and the life of the village as a key port began to fade. Etymology Named in 1879 after the lake, on whose south shore it is located. The community of Nipissing in the township, 25 km south of North Bay, was called Nipissingan in 1870, but its name was changed to Nipissing in 1881. Transportation The township is served in its northern part by Ontario Highway 534 and Ontario Highway 654, which connect east to Ontario Highway 11 at the communities of Powassan and Callander respectively; Ontario Highway 534 also connects west to Restoule Provincial Park, and via Ontario Highway 524 to Ontario Highway 522. The township is served across its southern part by Ontario Highway 522, which connects east to Highway 11 at Trout Creek and west to Ontario Highway 69 at the community of Cranberry.

The film stars Pamela Franklin, Roddy McDowall, Clive Revill, and Gayle Hunnicutt as a group of researchers who spend a week in a purportedly haunted English mansion in which previous investigators were killed. Plot The physicist Dr. Lionel Barrett is enlisted by eccentric millionaire Mr. Deutsch to make an investigation into \\"survival after death\\" in \\"the one place where it has yet to be refuted\\". This is Belasco House, the \\"Mount Everest of haunted houses\\", originally owned by the notorious \\"Roaring Giant\\" Emeric Belasco, a six-foot-five perverted millionaire and supposed murderer, who disappeared soon after a massacre at his home. The house is believed to be haunted by numerous spirits, the victims of Belasco's twisted and sadistic desires. Accompanying Barrett are his wife, Ann, as well as two mediums: mental medium and spiritualist minister Florence Tanner and physical medium Benjamin Franklin \\"Ben\\" Fischer, who is the only survivor of an investigation conducted 20 years before. The group arrive to begin their investigation a week before Christmas Eve, and the rationalist Barrett is rudely skeptical of Florence's belief in \\"surviving personalities\\", spirits which haunt the physical world, and he asserts that there is nothing but unfocused electromagnetic energy in the house. Barrett brings a machine he has developed, which he believes will rid the house of this energy. Though not a physical medium, Florence begins to manifest physical phenomena inside the house. When, after a quarrel with Tanner, Barrett is attacked by invisible forces, he suspects that Florence may be using the house's energy against him. Meanwhile, Fischer remains aloof, with his mind closed to the house's influence, and is only there to collect the generous paycheck. Ann Barrett is subjected to erotic visions late at night, which seem linked to her lackluster sex life. She goes downstairs and, in an apparent trance, disrobes and demands sex from Fischer. He strikes her, snapping her out of the trance, and she returns to herself, horrified and ashamed. A second incident occurs a day or so later; this time, she is awake but uninhibited due to alcohol. Her husband arrives a moment later to witness her advances to Fischer. He is resentful, and spurns Fischer's warnings that the house is affecting Ann, claiming that \\"Mr. Deutsch is wasting one-third of his money!\\" Stricken by the accusation, Fischer drops his psychic shields, but he is immediately attacked. Florence is convinced that one of the \\"surviving personalities\\" is Daniel, Belasco's tormented son, and she is determined to prove it at all costs. She finds a human skeleton chained behind a wall. Believing it to be Daniel, Florence and Fischer bury the body outside the house and Florence performs a funeral. Nevertheless, Daniel's \\"personality\\" continues to haunt Florence; she is scratched violently by a possessed cat. Barrett suspects that Florence is mutilating herself. In an attempt to put Daniel to rest, Florence gives herself to the entity sexually, but the entity brutalizes her and possesses her body. Barrett's machine is assembled. Possessed by the malevolent spirit, Florence attempts to destroy it, thinking that it will harm the spirits in the house, but she is prevented from doing serious damage. She enters the chapel, \\"the unholy heart\\" of the house, in an attempt to warn the spirits, but she is crushed by a falling crucifix. As she dies, she leaves a symbol written in her own blood. Barrett activates his machine, which seems to be effective. Fischer wanders the house afterwards, attempting to sense psychic energy; in astonishment, he declares the place \\"completely clear!\\" But violent psychic activity soon resumes, and Barrett is killed. Fischer decides to confront the house, and Ann accompanies him despite her misgivings. Deciphering Florence's dying clue, Fischer deduces that Belasco is the sole entity haunting the house, masquerading as many. He taunts Belasco, declaring him a \\"son of a whore\\", and that he was no \\"roaring giant\\", but instead more likely a \\"funny little dried-up bastard\\" who fooled everyone about his alleged height. Even as objects begin to hurl themselves at Fischer, he continues to defy the entity, challenging, \\"What size WERE you? Five foot two? One? I know! I'll bet you weren't even five foot tall!\\" At that, all becomes still. Fischer then concentrates, and a stained-glass partition in the chapel shatters, revealing a hidden door. Fischer and Ann discover a lead-lined room, containing Belasco's preserved body seated in a chair. Pulling out a pocket knife, Fischer rips open Belasco's trouser leg, discovering his final secret: a pair of prosthetic legs. Fischer realises that Belasco had had his own stunted legs amputated, and that he had used the prosthetics with which they were replaced in a grotesque attempt to appear imposing. Belasco also had the specially built room lined with lead, presaging the discovery of the electromagnetic nature of life after death. With the room now open, Fischer activates Barrett's machine a second time, and he and Ann leave the house, hoping that Barrett and Florence will guide Belasco to the afterlife without fear.

The Legend of Hell House is one of only two productions of James H. Nicholson after his departure from American International Pictures ‚Äî a company he had run, along with Samuel Z. Arkoff, since 1954. Nicholson died of a brain tumour in December 1972, before the film's release in June 1973. Nicholson's company, Academy Pictures Corporation, also released Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry through Twentieth Century Fox in 1974. Matheson's screenplay drastically reduced some of the more extreme elements of the novel, particularly the sexuality. The external shots of the house were filmed at Wykehurst Park, West Sussex. Mr. Deutsch's mansion in the opening sequence is Blenheim Palace in Woodstock, Oxfordshire. The interior shot of the long room is the palace's library. The role of Belasco was played by an uncredited Michael Gough. His part consisted of a couple of recorded lines and an on- camera appearance as an embalmed corpse seated upright in a chair. The plot of both this film and the book on which it is based, both written by Richard Matheson, have several details in common with Shirley Jackson‚Äôs 1959 novel The Haunting of Hill House (and subsequent 1963 movie adaptation The Haunting) in which a party of four (some psychic, some skeptical, some British, some Americans) stay in an extremely haunted Gothic mansion house with a terrible history, for the purposes of scientific study, and all are plagued by unseen terrors. It is to both of the films‚Äô credit that they only partially resemble each other. =Soundtrack= The film features a score with an electronic music bassline (with occasional woodwind and brass stabs). The score and electronic sound effects were created by Delia Derbyshire and Brian Hodgson, recorded at Hodgson's Electrophon studio in London. The soundtrack remains unavailable commercially. Reception Critical response to The Legend of Hell House varied. In 1976, Roger Ebert wrote in his review of Burnt Offerings, another movie about a haunted house, that \\"The Legend of Hell House brought out the fun in this sort of material very well.\\"Roger Ebert, \\"Burnt Offerings,\\" RogerEbert.com, 8 October 1976, URL accessed 4 February 2013. In his 2002 Movie & Video Guide, Leonard Maltin gave the film three of four stars and called it \\"Not the usual ghost story, and certain to curl a few hairs.\\"Leonard Maltin, ed., Leonard Maltin's 2002 Movie & Video Guide. A Signet Book, 2001, p. 53. A Signet Book, 2001, p. 778. The Time Out Company called the film disappointing, but it approved of Pamela Franklin's performance.\\"The Legend of Hell House,\\" Time Out London, URL accessed 4 February 2013. TV Guide stated that \\"While director John Hough does a fine job with the things-that-go-bump-in-the-night aspects of the material, he fails to breathe any life into Richard Matheson's woefully underdeveloped screenplay.\\"\\"The Legend Of Hell House: Review,\\" TV Guide's Movie Guide, URL accessed 4 February 2013. Home video release The Legend of Hell House was released on DVD by 20th Century Fox in 2001. The DVD included the theatrical trailer as a special feature. In August 2014, the Shout! Factory label Scream Factory released the film on Blu-ray. The release included a 30-minute interview with director John Hough, a commentary track by actress Pamela Franklin, stills gallery, original theatrical trailer, radio ads and reversible cover art featuring the theatrical artwork and customized artwork for the Blu-ray release.

Released in 1987, 10 years after Elton John's Greatest Hits Volume II, the compilation album features his greatest hits from 1979‚Äì1986 and was made available only in the United States and Canada. All of the songs featured had previously been released on a previous album. History The album was initially released under Geffen Records after John returned to his US label. Geffen was later bought out by MCA Records in 1990. John had just left MCA after the label released Greatest Hits Vol. 2. One-third of the album is composed of songs from Too Low for Zero, John‚Äôs 1983 album that received the most critical and commercial acclaim for the early 1980s, including the songs \\"I Guess That's Why They Call It the Blues\\" and \\"I'm Still Standing\\". Some of the artist‚Äôs less successful songs were also included on the tracking because they had been released in the past year. The album reached gold status by February in 1989, platinum in November 1991, and achieved 2x platinum in October 1995 by the RIAA. In 1992, two years after MCA purchased Geffen, Greatest Hits Volume III was removed from the artist‚Äôs repertoire and replaced with the famed Greatest Hits 1976-1986 album, and due to copyright issues, two tracks from Greatest Hits Volume II, \\"Don't Go Breaking My Heart\\" and \\"Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word\\" were moved to Greatest Hits 1976-1986 and replaced with \\"Tiny Dancer\\" and \\"I Feel Like a Bullet (In the Gun of Robert Ford)\\". Featured Songs \\"I Guess That's Why They Call It the Blues\\" Originally featured on Too Low for Zero, Bernie Taupin wrote the song for his wife, Toni Russo. The album itself was a turning point in Elton John‚Äôs relationship with Taupin, as the singer/songwriter duo had taken a break from 1977 to 1979, a time in which Taupin worked with other artists. Too Low for Zero was when the two reunited and created the album together. \\"Mama Can't Buy You Love\\" Originally featured on the EP The Thom Bell Sessions in 1979, it was one of three of John‚Äôs Number One R&B; records. The artist had considered the producer for the album, Thom Bell, to be an idol of his and looks back fondly on that era of his career. The song was written by LeRoy Bell and Casey James of Bell and James. \\"Little Jeannie\\" Included originally on 21 at 33, it was written by Gary Osborne. This album was composed half and half of songs from Osborne and Taupin, marking the beginning of John and Taupin‚Äôs break. 21 at 33 contained roughly half and half songs from the two lyricists. For this particular song, the melody was written before the lyrics. \\"Sad Songs (Say So Much)\\" From Breaking Hearts, was written by Bernie Taupin and even with its upbeat rhythm is about losing someone and was meant to help those grieving by listening to classic sad songs. \\"I'm Still Standing\\" Also written by Bernie Taupin off of Too Low for Zero, the song is aimed at a former lover. Contrary to popular belief of it being a statement of John‚Äôs resilience in the face of adversity for his flamboyant and non-traditional flair, Taupin actually wrote the song with a specific ex-lover in mind. \\"Empty Garden (Hey Hey Johnny)\\" Off of the Jump Up! album, the song was written as a tribute to the late John Lennon. The lyrics were first written by Taupin and John later composed the music. John has been quoted saying that he felt a particular connection to the song, being that he had been good friends with Lennon and is even the Godfather of Lennon‚Äôs younger son, Sean. \\"Heartache All Over the World\\" The first song completed for Leather Jackets, it was written by Bernie Taupin. John sings about the appeals of \\"the opposite sex\\". John later reported feeling dishonest about the track as he came out as openly gay in 1988, two years after the song was released. \\"Too Low for Zero\\" First appearing on the album of the same name, the lyrics were written by Bernie Taupin and music composed by Elton John. The song has a catchy energy despite its darker lyrics. \\"Kiss the Bride\\" Released initially as a single and then on the album Too Low For Zero, it features lyrics by Bernie Taupin and music by Elton John. The song is upbeat and is reported to be a popular song choice to play at weddings. \\"Blue Eyes\\" From John‚Äôs Jump Up! album, the lyrics to the song were written by Gary Osborne to which John wrote the music for. The song was nominated for a Grammy in 1983 for Best Male Vocal Pop Performance. \\"Nikita\\" Originally appearing on Ice on Fire, John sings of being in love with an East German Border guard during the Cold War, but their love is forbidden because John is unable to enter the country. Taupin wrote the lyrics and it features George Michael and Nik Kershaw on backup vocals. \\"Wrap Her Up\\" Also from Ice on Fire, the song again features George Michael and was originally released as a single and is famous for its name dropping of multiple famous women. John and Taupin collaborated with Charlie Morgan, Paul Westwood, and Fred Mandal. It is by far the longest song featured on the album at 6:04. In 1992, this album was deleted and replaced with Greatest Hits 1976‚Äì1986. MCA had taken over Geffen Records, and control of copyrights had shifted such that 1977's Greatest Hits Volume II could no longer be presented as before. Two songs from it, \\"Don't Go Breaking My Heart\\" and \\"Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word\\", were shifted to the new third volume, which also now included 1984's \\"Who Wears These Shoes?\\". To make room for these additions, the 1986 non-hit \\"Heartache All Over the World\\" and 1983's album-only track \\"Too Low for Zero\\" were eliminated.

It is believed that Makobo Modjadji had the ability to control the clouds and rivers. Makobo was crowned on 16 April 2003 at the age of 25. With her cousin/sister Princess Dr Tebogo Mokope Modjadji-Kekana by her side. After the death of her predecessor and grandmother, Queen Mokope Modjadji. This made her the youngest Queen in the history of the Balobedu tribe. Life Makobo was the daughter of Princess Makheala, and was the only Rain Queen to be formally educated. She was crowned Rain Queen in 2003, two years after the death of her mother, Makheala, and the previous Rain Queen, her grandmother Mokope Modjadji. Her mother, the designated successor, had died two days before Mokope Modjadji had died, therefore Makobo was selected as the next Rain Queen. On the day of the coronation, a slight drizzle fell, which was interpreted as a good omen. The coronation was an elaborate ceremony, but it is believed that Makobo accepted the crown reluctantly. Although respected for her abilities and lineage, Makobo was seen as too modern to be the next Rain Queen, which may have been why there was such a long delay before she was crowned. Custom dictated that rain queens live reclusive lives, hidden in the royal kraal with the \\"royal wives\\". Makobo Modjadji, however, liked to wear jeans and T-shirts, visit nearby discos, watch soap operas and chat on her cell phone. Modjadji also had a boyfriend, David Mogale, who was believed to have fathered her second child. He is the former municipal manager of Greater Letaba Local Municipality. He is also rumoured to have moved into the Royal Compound to live with her. This caused great controversy with the Royal Council, as the Rain Queen is only ever supposed to mate with nobles who the Royal Council themselves chose. Death and alleged conspiracy On 10 June 2005 Makobo was admitted to the Polokwane Medi-Clinic with a then-undisclosed illness; she died two days later at the age of 27. There is a lot of controversy surrounding the late Rain Queen's death. Some villagers believe she died from a broken heart when her lover David Mogale was banned from the Royal Village by the Royal Council. Mogale himself claims that the Royal Council poisoned Makobo, as they saw her unfit to hold the much-revered position of Rain Queen, and this was the easiest way to have her removed. Hospital staff believed she died of AIDS, while others are concerned with the disappearance of Makobo's brother, Mpapatla, last seen on the day of Makobo's death. A fire broke out in the local chief's house, where Makobo's coffin was being kept, before her funeral. The fire was extinguished before Makobo's coffin suffered any damage, but the event seemed to arouse more suspicions of foul play surrounding Makobo's death. Officially, Makobo died of chronic meningitis.

Founded in 1724 and based in the commune of Cognac, it is one of the biggest cognac producers and is also part of the Comit√© Colbert, an association \\"to promote the concept of luxury\\". The brand specialises in Cognac Fine Champagne. History Paul-Emile R√©my Martin The name R√©my Martin comes from the name of the company founder, born in 1695 near Rouillac in southwestern France. A winegrower by trade, in 1724 he created a trading house of cognac. After his death in 1773, his grandson, also named R√©my, pursued the business.Dictionnaire biographique des Charentais, (Charentais biographical dictionary), Editions Le Cro√Æt Vif, (The Living Growth), 2005, p. 1107‚Äì1110. In 1841, Paul-Emile-R√©my Martin assumed control of the business and oversaw great growth. He added a logo to the bottles and cases, in the shape of a centaur, a mythological creature representing Sagittarius, Martin's own zodiac sign. The R√©my Martin brand uses a distinctive centaur logo and in China is also called r√©nt√≥umƒÉ (‰∫∫Â§¥È©¨), literally \\"man-headed horse\\". During the interwar period, Andr√© Renaud, a trained lawyer and merchant, who had been a partner in E. R√©my Martin & Co. since 1910, took the lead, and in 1927 launched the first VSOP Fine Champagne. R√©my Martin cognacs were then sold worldwide. After World War II, R√©my Martin continued its rise under Andr√© H√©riard-Dubreuil, Andr√© Renaud's son-in-law. At the death of Andr√© Renaud in 1965, Andr√© H√©riard- Dubreuil became president. His children gradually joined him, notably his daughter Dominique H√©riard-Dubreuil who became general manager in 1988 and president two years later. In 1991, the House of R√©my Martin incorporated R√©my Cointreau into the family group. Production R√©my Martin buildings All R√©my Martin cognacs have the Cognac Fine Champagne appellation, meaning that they come exclusively from a blend of eaux-de-vie from the Grande Champagne and Petite Champagne crus, with at least 50% of Grande Champagne. Thanks to chalky soils, these eaux-de-vie have a great ageing potential and a particular aromatic intensity. Since 1948, under the leadership of Andr√© Renaud, R√©my Martin has made this exclusive choice. During the 1960s, l‚ÄôAlliance Fine Champagne (the Fine Champagne Alliance) was created by Andr√© H√©riard Dubreuil of the House of R√©my Martin. This cooperative brings together a thousand winegrowers from Petite Champagne and Grande Champagne and supplies almost 90% of the eaux-de-vie of the House. The R√©my Martin House markets more than 80% of the Fine Champagne cognacs. R√©my Martin uses traditional distillation on the lees (retaining the sediments that occur during vinification of the grapes) in small copper stills. Ageing takes place in oak barrels of the Limousin type, during which the alcohol evaporates (the angels' share) and blackens the walls of the cellars. The eau-de-vie slowly evolves over time, punctuated by periods of rest and changes of barrel. The exchanges between the wood, oxygen and the eaux-de-vie are constant. Depending on which style is sought, cognac can age in young or old barrels, with a stronger or finer grain on the oak staves. Finally comes the blending of the different barrels to create a cognac. The House‚Äôs current Cellar Master, Baptiste Loiseau, assumed the position in 2014 at the age of 34. He follows in the footsteps of Andr√© Renaud, Andr√© Giraud, Georges Clot, and Pierrette Trichet. Bottlings =R√©my Martin VSOP= Created in 1927, R√©my Martin VSOP is the biggest selling VSOP cognac worldwide.

Rather than using the oak barrel aging process, the liquid undergoes a proprietary filtration process, giving it a transparent color and subtle taste with hints of pear and a fresh minty aftertaste. It is not a cognac, but an eau-de-vie de vin Cultural references The House of R√©my Martin partners with artists to represent its cognacs. These include Californian actor Jeremy Renner, Chinese actor and singer Huang Xiaoming, and Taiwanese mandopop singer Jolin Tsai. In 2008, the American photographer and director David LaChapelle created a bottle design. In 2013, R√©my Martin teamed up with American-Canadian singer and producer Robin Thicke to launch a limited edition of VSOP. R√©my Martin can also be found in the world of rap, especially in America with Fetty Wap frequently mentioning the 1738 variety in his work. Pete Townshend of rock band the Who wryly thanked R√©my Martin for saving his life \\"by making the bloody stuff so expensive\\" in the inner sleeve to his 1980 solo album Empty Glass. He also referred to the drink in the lyrics to his single \\"A Little Is Enough\\" by singing \\"I'm like a connoisseur of champagne cognac, the perfume nearly beats the taste.\\"https://genius.com/Pete-townshend-a-little-is-enough- lyrics And he can also be seen drinking straight from a bottle of R√©my Martin in the music video to his song \\"Keep on Working\\". John Entwistle, who was also in the Who was known for his love of the drink,https://www.thewho.com/reflections-on-john-entwistle/ and included the V.S.O.P. grading on the album cover to his 1973 solo album Rigor Mortis Sets In, as an inscription on an outdoor grave's footstone which was either the front cover or the photo used on the inside of the gatefold depending on where the record was issued. The Dynasty and the Chinese market In 1980, at the beginning of the Chinese economic reform, R√©my Martin ventured into China with the Dynasty brand (Dynasty Wine Ltd), the first foreign wine maker and the second joint-venture in all China.

He is best known for his books on topics including Internet design and development, mobile device usage, and game programming. Morrison's writing career began in the early 1990s and coincided with the release of the Java programming language. He embraced the Java technology and wrote and contributed to numerous Java books, as well as developing several online Java courses. His first book was actually Windows 95 Game Developer's Guide Using the Game SDK, which was the first book to explore and demystify Microsoft's new (at the time) DirectX game development technology. He co-authored his first book with his close friend and former college roommate, the late Randy Weems, who Morrison credits with a great deal of his technical knowledge. Morrison quickly followed up this book by serving as lead author of Java Unleashed, which quickly became a best-seller. He went on to write books on numerous Web-related technologies such as HTML, XML, CSS, and JavaScript, and also ventured into end-user writing by authoring books on Pocket PC, BlackBerry, and Treo handheld devices. Morrison was born in Nashville, Tennessee. He has a B.A. from Tennessee Technological University in Electrical Engineering, although he credits the school with little beyond serving as the place where he met his wife and a handful of close friends.

He was mayor of Manawatu from 1995 to 1998 and twice stood unsuccessfully for Parliament under the United Future banner. He is also known for his wearing of kaftans during the 1980s while Police Association secretary, and female attire in the High Court and Court of Appeal in 2006. Early life and family One of 10 children, Moodie was born in Dunedin in 1938. He was made a ward of the state following his father's death from tuberculosis and grew up in a boys' home from the age of seven. He was fostered by the Clyne family living near Oamaru and attended Waitaki Boys' High School. However, he did not do well at school and left aged 15. He worked as a freezing worker and a fencing contractor before deciding to join the police when he was 19. Police and legal careers Moodie joined the New Zealand Police in 1959 and served as a detective in Wellington, rising to the rank of inspector. He then studied law at Victoria University of Wellington, graduating with first-class honours and subsequently completed a PhD in 1976. From 1976 to 1986, he was secretary of the New Zealand Police Association and was awarded life membership in 1987. Moodie acted for Keith and Margaret Berryman, whose farm was the scene of a bridge collapse that killed a visiting beekeeper in 1994. The Te Rata Bridge had been designed and built by the New Zealand Army, which disputed claims that the collapse was caused by poor design and construction. Moodie ultimately won the case in 2008 when the High Court quashed the coroner's report that held that the Berrymans were largely responsible for the collapse. Political career Moodie was elected mayor of Manawatu in 1995 and served one term. At the 1998 local-body elections, he stood for the mayoralties of both Manawatu District and Palmerston North, finishing third in Manawatu and 13th in Palmerston North. At the 2002 general election, Moodie was the United Future candidate for the Wellington Central electorate and was ranked 40th on the party list. He gained 938 votes to finish in fifth position in Wellington Central and his list placing was too low for him to be elected. In 2005, Moodie again stood for United Future, this time in the Rangitikei electorate. He came in fourth, polling 718 votes. He was not included on United Future's party list. Cross-dressing A married heterosexual with three children, Moodie has said that he has a \\"strong female gender bias\\" and has always preferred women's clothes. He began wearing kaftans publicly in 1981 while secretary of the Police Association, as a statement about the macho culture of the New Zealand Police at the time. In 2006, he wore women's clothing when appearing at the High Court in Wellington facing contempt charges arising from his release of a suppressed report during the Berryman case. He said that his attire was a \\"gender-bending protest against the male-dominated corruption of New Zealand's judicial system\\". He wore an Alice in Wonderland outfit before the Court of Appeal and officially changed his name to Miss Alice. Goat farming Moodie began farming and breeding pedigree Angora and Boer goats on a property near Karori in Wellington in 1979. He later spent six years running a goat quarantine farm near Feilding. Documentary A 52-minute documentary made about Moodie in 2009, titled Lost in Wonderland, was directed by Zoe McIntosh and produced by Costa Botes. It won awards for best cinematography and best popular documentary at the 2010 Qantas Film and Television Awards.

This colorless liquid has a sweet, ether-like odor, as it derives from the family of glycol ethers, and is a butyl ether of ethylene glycol. As a relatively nonvolatile, inexpensive solvent, it is used in many domestic and industrial products because of its properties as a surfactant. It is a known respiratory irritant and can be acutely toxic but animal studies did not find it to be mutagenic, and no studies suggest it is a human carcinogen. A study of 13 classroom air contaminants conducted in Portugal reported a statistically significant association with increased rates of nasal obstruction, the study also reported a positive association below the level of statistical significance with a higher risk of obese asthma and increased child BMI. Production 2-Butoxyethanol is commonly obtained through two processes; the ethoxylation reaction of butanol and ethylene oxide in the presence of a catalyst: :C2H4O + C4H9OH ‚Üí C4H9OC2H4OH or the etherification of butanol with 2-chloroethanol. 2-butoxyethanol can be obtained in the laboratory by performing a ring opening of 2-propyl-1,3-dioxolane with boron trichloride. It is often produced industrially by combining ethylene glycol and butyraldehyde in a Parr reactor with palladium on carbon. In 2006, the European production of butyl glycol ethers amounted to 181 kilotons, of which approximately 50% (90 kt/a) was 2-Butoxyethanol. World production is estimated to be 200 to 500 kt/a, of which 75% is for paints and coatings and 18% for metal cleaners and household cleaners. In the US, it is considered a High Production Volume Chemical because greater than 100 million pounds of this chemical is produced per year. Uses 2-Butoxyethanol is a glycol ether with modest surfactant properties (and it can be used as a mutual solvent). In use since the 1930s, glycol ethers are solvents that dissolve both water-soluble and hydrophobic substances. Glycol ethers consist of two components, an alcohol and ether. According to the nature of alcohol, molecules of this class can be divided into two groups: E series and P series which correspond to ethylene and propylene respectively. Glycol ethers are selected for specific purposes, such as solubility, inflammability, and volatility. =Commercial uses= 2-Butoxyethanol is a solvent for paints and surface coatings, as well as cleaning products and inks. Products that contain 2-butoxyethanol include acrylic resin formulations, asphalt release agents, firefighting foam, leather protectors, oil spill dispersants, degreaser applications, photographic strip solutions, whiteboard cleaners, liquid soaps, cosmetics, dry cleaning solutions, lacquers, varnishes, herbicides, latex paints, enamels, printing paste, and varnish removers, and silicone caulk. Products containing this compound are commonly found at construction sites, automobile repair shops, print shops, and facilities that produce sterilizing and cleaning products. It is the main ingredient of many home, commercial and industrial cleaning solutions. Since the molecule has both non-polar and polar ends, butoxyethanol is useful for removing both polar and non-polar substances, like grease and oils. It is also approved by the U.S. FDA to be used as direct and indirect food additives, which include antimicrobial agents, defoamers, stabilizers, and adhesives. =In the petroleum industry= 2-Butoxyethanol is commonly produced for the oil industry because of its surfactant properties. In the petroleum industry, 2-butoxyethanol is a component of fracturing fluids, drilling stabilizers, and oil slick dispersants for both water-based and oil- based hydraulic fracturing When liquid is pumped into the well, the fracturing fluids are pumped under extreme pressure, so 2-butoxyethanol is used to stabilize them by lowering the surface tension. As a surfactant, 2-butoxyethanol adsorbs at the oil-water interface of the fracture. The compound is also used to facilitate the release of the gas by preventing congealing. It is also used as a crude oil-water coupling solvent for more general oil well workovers. Because of its surfactant properties, it is a major constituent (30‚Äì60% w/w) in the oil spill dispersant Corexit 9527, which was widely used in the aftermath of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Safety 2-Butoxyethanol has a low acute toxicity, with of 2.5 g/kg in rats.Siegfried Rebsdat, Dieter Mayer \\"Ethylene Glycol\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2000.. Laboratory tests by the U. S. National Toxicology Program have shown that only sustained exposure to high concentrations (100-500 ppm) of 2-butoxyethanol can cause adrenal tumors in animals. American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) reports that 2-butoxyethanol is carcinogenic in rodents. These rodent tests may not directly translate to carcinogenicity in humans, as the observed mechanism of cancer involves the rodents' forestomach, which humans lack. OSHA does not regulate 2-butoxyethanol as a carcinogen. 2-butoxyethanol has not been shown to penetrate shale rock in a study conducted by Manz. =Disposal and degradation= 2-Butoxyethanol can be disposed of by incineration. It was shown that disposal occurs faster in the presence of semiconductor particles. 2-Butoxyethanol usually decomposes in the presence of air within a few days by reacting with oxygen radicals.Hullar, T.; Anastasio, C. Yields of hydrogen peroxide from the reaction of hydroxyl radical with organic compounds in solution and ice. Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, 11, 7209. It has not been identified as a major environmental contaminant, nor is it known to bio-accumulate. 2-Butoxyethanol biodegrades in soils and water, with a half life of 1‚Äì4 weeks in aquatic environments. =Human exposure= 2-butoxyethanol most commonly enters the human body system through dermal absorption, inhalation, or oral consumption of the chemical. The ACGIH threshold limit value (TLV) for worker exposure is 20 ppm, which is well above the odor detection threshold of 0.4 ppm. Blood or urine concentrations of 2-butoxyethanol or the metabolite 2-butoxyacetic acid may be measured using chromatographic techniques. A biological exposure index of 200 mg 2-butoxyacetic acid per g creatinine has been established in an end-of- shift urine specimen for U.S. employees.2009 TLVs and BEIs, American Conference of Industrial Hygienists, Cincinnati, Ohio, 2009, p.101. 2-Butoxyethanol and its metabolites fall to undetectable levels in urine after about 30 hours in human males. =Animal studies= Harmful effects have been observed in nonhuman mammals exposed to high levels of 2-butoxyethanol. Developmental effects were seen in a study that exposed pregnant Fischer 344 rats, a type of laboratory rat, and New Zealand white rabbits to varying doses of 2-butoxyethanol. At 100 ppm (483 mg/m3) and 200 ppm (966 mg/m3) exposure, statistically significant increases were observed in the number of litters with skeletal defects. Additionally, 2-butoxyethanol was associated with a significant decrease in maternal body weight, uterine weight, and number of total implants.Wess, Ms. J., Dr. H. Ahlers, and Dr. S Dobson. \\"Concise International Chemical Assessment Document 10: 2-Butoxyethanol.\\" World Health Organization, n.d. Web. 2-Butoxyethanol is metabolized in mammals by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase. Neurological effects have also been observed in animals exposed to 2-butoxyethanol. Fischer 344 rats exposed to 2-butoxyethanol at concentrations of 523 ppm and 867 ppm experienced decreased coordination. Male rabbits showed a loss of coordination and equilibrium after exposure to 400 ppm of 2-butoxyethanol for two days.United States of America. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. Department of Health and Human Services. Toxicological Profile for 2-Butoxyethanol and 2-Butoxyethanol Acetate. By Olivia Harris, Sharon Wilbur, Julia George, and Carol Eisenmann. Atlanta: n.p., 1998. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. Web. When exposed to 2-butoxyethanol in drinking water, both F344/N rats and B63F1 mice showed negative effects. The range of exposure for the two species was between 70 mg/kg body weight per day to 1300 mg/kg body weight per day. Decreased body weight and water consumption were seen for both species. Rats had reduced red blood cell counts and thymus weights, as well as lesions in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow. =Regulation in Canada= Environment and Health Canada recommended that 2-butoxyethanol be added to Schedule 1 of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA). Under these regulations, products containing 2-butoxyethanol are to be diluted below a certain concentration. Only those in which the user performs the required dilution are required to include it on labelling information. =Regulation in the US= 2-Butoxyethanol is listed in California as a hazardous substance and the state sets an 8 hour average airborne concentration exposure limit at 25 ppm, and in California employers are required to inform employees when they are working with it. It is approved by the Food and Drug Administration as \\"an indirect and direct food additive for use as an antimicrobial agent, defoamer, stabilizer and component of adhesives\\", and also \\"may be used to wash or assist in the peeling of fruits and vegetables\\" and \\"may be safely used as components of articles intended for use in packaging, transporting & holding food\\".CFR Title 21 - Food and Drugs - URL: http://www.fda.gov (2004). CFR Title: 21 CFR Part Section: 173.315 After it was deleted from a UN list of substances requiring special toxicity labeling in 1994, and a subsequent petition by the American Chemistry Council, 2-butoxyethanol was removed from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's list of hazardous air pollutants in 2004. The safety of products containing 2-butoxyethanol as normally used is defended by the industry trade groups the American Chemistry Council and the Soap and Detergent Association.

In 1980, he married Melissa Martin, a graphic designer and writer who serves as his business partner.Rafter, Dan. \\"Conquering Comics ... and Marriage, Too\\", Firefox News, October 9, 2007. WebCitation archive. In the mid-to-late 1980s Ellis worked as the primary writer for Adventure Publications' line of comic magazines, scripting such diverse titles as Ninja Elite, Warriors, Netherworlds, and Star Rangers, working with legendary comics artist Jim Mooney on the latter title. In 1987‚Äì1988 Ellis created and scripted Adventure Publications' Death Hawk, a series that featured the first published work of comics artist Adam Hughes. For other comics publishers he wrote The Justice Machine as well as short stories for the occasional anthology, such as \\"A Trip To Necropolis,\\" a story which featured the last full pencil and ink by Jim Mooney. =Millennium Publications= In 1990, Ellis co-founded Millennium Publications, serving as editor, with his wife and co-founder Melissa Martin as art director. Millennium gave early exposure to such comics artists as Mike Wieringo and Darryl Banks, and utilized such industry veterans as Jim Mooney and Don Heck. Its projects included H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu: The Whisperer in Darkness a twelve-issue adaptation of Anne Rice's The Mummy or Ramses the Damned among many others. For Millennium, Ellis conceived and scripted Nosferatu: Plague of Terror, a four-part series that provided a complete story of the title character's origin quite apart from the Dracula legend. Ellis also adapted the TV series The Man from U.N.C.L.E. and The Wild Wild West, and the horror film It! The Terror from Beyond Space into comics. Working with artist Darryl Banks he adapted the pulp fiction hero Doc Savage into the four- part miniseries Doc Savage: The Monarch of Armageddon.

Early life  Barbara Grizzuti was born in Queens, New York City, on September 14, 1934. Her parents were first-generation Americans; her grandparents were immigrants from Calabria in Southern Italy. She later described her childhood as deeply troubled. Her mother, who apparently suffered from mental illness, was emotionally distant and insisted on describing herself as \\"Barbara's relative\\", not her mother. Near the end of her life Harrison also claimed that her father had sexually abused her. The turmoil of her childhood would have a strong influence on her writing. When Harrison was nine years old, she and her mother were converted by a Jehovah's Witness missionary who visited the family. Harrison's father and brother did not convert, and this caused a rift in the household. Harrison's mother immersed herself totally in her new faith, even making a pact with a Witness man to marry after Harrison's father had perished in the Last Judgment. Harrison later said that the Witnesses' bloody visions of apocalypse both stimulated her imagination and made her frightened to use it. A precocious student, Harrison skipped several grades in school. As a teenager at New Utrecht High School in Brooklyn, she fell in love with Arnold Horowitz, an English teacher who was among the first to encourage her writing talent. He apparently returned her feelings, and although their relationship remained platonic, they continued to see each other and to correspond until Horowitz's death in the late 1960s. After graduating from high school, Harrison, who had been forbidden to attend university, went to live and work at the Jehovah's Witness world headquarters, the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society in Brooklyn Heights. Her friendship with Horowitz scandalised her colleagues there; Nathan H. Knorr, then head of the Watchtower Society, told Harrison to stop seeing Horowitz, but she was unable to do so. The relationship was but one symptom of a growing conflict between Harrison's faith and her artistic sensibilities, which eventually led to a nervous breakdown. At the age of 22, Harrison left the facility, and very shortly afterward renounced her faith altogether. Harrison found work as a publisher's secretary and became involved in the bohemian life of Greenwich Village. She had a turbulent three-year affair with an African-American jazz trumpeter whom she never publicly named. Through him, Harrison associated with many of the leading jazz musicians of the day, including Ben Webster, Billie Holiday and Frank Sinatra. \\"Jazzman\\", as Harrison called her lover in her autobiography, would come back into her life nearly 40 years later; the two would resume their affair with undiminished passion and conflict until a second, and final, break-up. In 1960 Barbara Grizzuti married W. Dale Harrison, an aid worker for Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere (CARE). The couple spent the eight years of their marriage living in Tripoli, Mumbai, Hyderabad, India, and Chichicastenango. The Harrisons had a son, Joshua, and a daughter, Anna. They divorced in 1968, and Barbara returned to New York with the children.  First publications  By now Harrison had become involved with the women's movement, and she began writing on feminist themes for various publications. Her first book, Unlearning the Lie: Sexism in School, was published in 1969, a report on the Sex-roles Committee of Woodward SchoolReview of Unlearning the Lie: Sexism in School, Kirkus Reviews. that was described as \\"a brief and readable account of a two-year effort to change sexist attitudes, beliefs, and practices, in and out of the curriculum, at a private, multiracial elementary school in Brooklyn, New York.\\"\\"Review of Unlearning the Lie: Sexism in School\\", Feminist Studies Quarterly, Fall 1973. Harrison was one of the first contributors to Ms. magazine. She became nationally known in 1978 when she published Visions of Glory: A History and a Memory of Jehovah's Witnesses, which combined childhood memoirs with a history of the Jehovah's Witness movement. Although Harrison expressed admiration for individual Witnesses and wrote sympathetically of their persecution, she portrayed the faith itself as harsh and tyrannical, racist and sexist.Barbara Grizzuti Harrison, Visions of Glory, Simon & Schuster, 1978, chapter 1.Elaine Woo, \\"Barbara G. Harrison, 67; Writer Known for Her Fierce Opinions\\", Obituaries, Los Angeles Times, April 27, 2002. Harrison was an agnostic when she began Visions of Glory, but while writing it she experienced a spiritual epiphany and converted to Catholicism. Her conversion became the subject of the book's last chapter. She drew much of her spirituality from the Catholic Worker Movement and from the medieval female mystics.  Journalism, travel writing and fiction  Harrison wrote for many of the leading periodicals of her time, including The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, The New Republic, Harper's, The Atlantic Monthly, The Village Voice, The Nation, Ladies' Home Journal and Mother Jones magazine. Among the people she interviewed were Red Barber, Mario Cuomo, Jane Fonda, Gore Vidal, Joan Didion, Francis Ford Coppola, Nadia ComƒÉneci, Alessandra Mussolini Barbara Bush and Oprah Winfrey. Because of her background, Harrison was often asked to write about movements that were perceived to be cults; she described families affected by the Unification Church and the Northeast Kingdom Community Church, and reported on the U.S. government's deadly standoff with the Branch Davidians in Waco, Texas. Harrison published two collections of her essays and interviews: Off Center (1980) and The Astonishing World (1992). Her 1992 Harper's essay \\"P.C. on the Grill\\", which lampooned the \\"philosophy\\" of popular TV chef The Frugal Gourmet, was included in the 1993 edition of Best American Essays. Harrison also wrote numerous travel articles covering destinations all over the world. She published two books about her travels in Italy, Italian Days (1989) and The Islands of Italy: Sicily, Sardinia, and the Aeolian Islands (1991). In 1984 Harrison published a novel, Foreign Bodies. She won an O. Henry Award for short fiction in 1989.  Final years  In 1994 Harrison, who had been a heavy smoker for most of her adult life, was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. During her illness she completed her last book, An Accidental Autobiography (1996). As the title implied, the book was less a straightforward memoir than a stream-of- consciousness collection of memories and reflections, loosely organised by theme. As The Washington Post' reviewer put it: \\"This is by no stretch an autobiography. For one thing, Barbara Grizzuti Harrison scarcely touches upon her professional life. ... But there is so much sex and food and high life and glittering prose in these loosely woven memoirs that she can be pardoned her presumptuous title.\\"Dennis Drabelle, \\"An Accidental Biography\\", The Washington Post, July 7, 1996. Harrison wrote little afterwards, as her illness progressed. She died on April 24, 2002, in a hospice in Manhattan.

A professor of chemistry at Tufts University, Chakmakjian wrote numerous books in several languages. His notable publications included an English-Armenian dictionary which is believed to be the first of its kind in the modern Armenian language. The dictionary has become an enduring work of Armenian lexicography and remains regularly used today. His other publications included a 700-page history of Armenia. Family / Early background Chakmakjian was of Armenian background and was born in Adana, Ottoman Empire on 20 October 1878. His surname means \\"gunsmith\\", a name given to one of his ancestors who had been skilled in creating finely engraved and decorated firearms. Born in 1878, his parents were Hovanes L. Chakmakjian and Cohar Garabed Janbazian, both farmers. He studied at the Abcarian (Apcarian) High School in Adana, then studied for just over one year at the Antoura French Missionary College in Beirut. Career Chakmakjian began his career as a teacher and taught in Gesaria (Kayseri today) and in Giresun. He taught in Beirut in the early years of the 20th century, during the time of one of the early Ottoman massacres of Armenians. Rather than return to his birthplace of Adana, he decided to take a ship to France. He subsequently moved to Stamford, Connecticut and eventually settled in Boston, Massachusetts, where he studied at Harvard University from fall 1905 to spring 1908, then entered Harvard again in February 1912, obtaining an A.B. degree in June 1913 (as a member of the class of 1909). Chakmakjian also served as the editor of the Hairenik newspaper from 1909 to 1911. He later served as a professor of chemistry and biochemistry at Tufts College, and was affiliated with the Tufts Medical School on Huntington Avenue in Boston. He retired from the Medical School in 1949. Thereafter, in 1955, Chakmakjian retired from Tufts University as a Professor emeritus. Marriage On May 28, 1910, in Somerville, Massachusetts, he married Madeleine Scott (d. October 3, 1930), an American woman of Scottish and English descent who had graduated from Wellesley College. They had one son, Alan Hovhannes, a future composer who reached international fame, who was born on 8 March 1911. Death Chakmakjian died of bronchopneumonia in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts on May 22, 1973, aged 94. Literary work In addition to his scientific work, in 1908 Chakmakjian became the chief-editor for The Hairenik newspaper while studying at Harvard, remaining in that position until February 1912. He also authored A Comprehensive Dictionary English-Armenian of approximately 1,600 pages published under the name H. H. Chakmakjian, printed in 1922 by Yeran Press in Boston. The dictionary was republished several times till that date. Other scholarly articles included topics related to chemistry, biochemistry, and the Armenian language. Among his other publications was a book of about 700 pages on the history of Armenia published in 1917. He was a member of the American Chemical Society, was a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and a member of the New England Association of Chemistry Teachers.

They burned part of the town and killed 47 villagers. The raiders left with 112 settlers as captives, whom they took overland the nearly 300 miles to Montreal. Some died or were murdered along the way, and 60 were later ransomed by family and community. Others were adopted by Mohawk families and became assimilated into the tribe. In this period, the English and their Indian allies were involved in similar raids against French villages along the northern area between the spheres of influence. Typical of the small-scale frontier conflict in Queen Anne's War, the French-led raid relied on a coalition of French soldiers and a variety of about 300 Indian warriors, mostly Abenaki but including a number of Pocumtuc who had once lived in the Deerfield area. Given the diversity of personnel, motivations, and material objectives, the raiders did not achieve full surprise when they entered the palisaded village. The defenders of some fortified houses in the village successfully held off the raiders until arriving reinforcements prompted their retreat. However, the raid was a clear victory for the French coalition that aimed to take captives and unsettle English colonial frontier society. More than 100 captives were taken, and about 40 percent of the village houses were destroyed. Although predicted because of existing tensions during the war, the raid shocked New England colonists. Conflict increased with the French and their Native American allies. Frontier settlements took actions to fortify their towns and prepare for war. The raid has been immortalized as a part of the early American frontier story, principally due to the published account by a prominent captive, the Rev. John Williams. He and much of his family were taken on the long overland journey to Canada. His young daughter Eunice was adopted by a Mohawk family; she became assimilated and married a Mohawk man. Williams' account, The Redeemed Captive, was published in 1707 and was widely popular in the colonies. Background When European colonists began in the 17th century to settle in the middle reaches of the Connecticut River valley (where it presently flows through the state of Massachusetts), the area was inhabited by the Algonquian-speaking Pocomtuc nation.Melvoin, pp. 26‚Äì29 In the early 1660s, the Pocumtuc were shattered as a nation due to conflict with the aggressive Mohawk, one of the Five Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, who were located in eastern New York and raided into New England. They also had suffered population losses due to chronic infectious disease carried by traders and colonists, to which the latter two groups had some acquired immunity.Melvoin, pp. 39‚Äì47 In 1665 villagers from the eastern Massachusetts town of Dedham were given a grant in the area, and acquired land titles of uncertain legality from a variety of Pocumtuc individuals. They established a village in the early 1670s, at first called Pocumtuck, but later Deerfield.Melvoin, pp. 52‚Äì58 Located in a relatively isolated position in the Massachusetts colony, on the edge of English settlement, Deerfield became a target of frontier conflict between the French and English and their differing Native American allies. The colonial outpost was a traditional New England subsistence farming community. The majority of Deerfield's settlers were young families who had moved west in the search of land. The labor of the wives and other women was essential to the survival of the settlement and its male inhabitants.Melvoin, p. 483. =Previous raids on Deerfield= By 1675 the village had grown to about 200 individuals. In that year, conflict between English colonists and Indians in southern New England erupted into what is now known as King Philip's War.Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 20 The war involved all of the New England colonies, and the English destroyed or severely decimated and pacified most of its Indian nations. There were also many casualties among the New England colonists. Deerfield was evacuated in September 1675 after a coordinated series of Native American attacks, culminating in the Battle of Bloody Brook, resulted in the death of about half the village's adult males. The abandoned village, one of several in the Connecticut River valley abandoned by the English, was briefly reoccupied by the warring Indians.Melvoin, pp. 108,114Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 21 The colonists regrouped, and in 1676 a force of mostly local colonists slaughtered an Indian camp at a site then called Peskeompscut. It is now called Turners Falls, after William Turner, an English leader who was slain in the action.Melvoin, p. 115 This map depicts the approximate distribution of Indian tribes throughout southern New England in about 1600; later English colonial settlements, including Deerfield and locations of significance in King Philip's War, are shown. Ongoing raids by the Mohawk forced many of the remaining Indians to retreat north to French-controlled Canada or to the west.Melvoin, p. 121 Those going west joined other tribes that had formed a peace of sorts with the authorities in the eastern area of the Province of New York. During King William's War (1688‚Äì1697), Deerfield was not subjected to major attacks, but 12 residents were killed in a series of ambushes and other incidents. Supposedly friendly Indians who were recognized as Pocumtuc were recorded as passing through the area. Some claimed to have participated in attacks on other frontier communities.Haefeli and Sweeney, pp. 29‚Äì30 English attacks on the frontier communities of what is now southern Maine in the Northeast Coast Campaign of 1703 again put Deerfield residents on the alert, as they feared retaliation. In response to their own losses in the Campaign, the French and native allies attacked Deerfield. The town's palisade, constructed during King William's War, had been rehabilitated and expanded.Melvoin, p. 213 In August of that year, the local militia commander called out the militia after he received intelligence of \\"a party of French & Indians from Canada\\" who were \\"expected every hour to make some attaque on ye towns upon Connecticut River\\".Melvoin, p. 212 However, nothing happened until October, when two men were taken from a pasture outside the palisade. Militia were sent to guard the town in response, but these returned to their homes with the advent of winter, which was generally not the period for warfare. Minor raids against other communities convinced Governor Joseph Dudley to send 20 men to garrison Deerfield in February. These men, minimally trained militia from other nearby communities, had arrived by the 24th, making for somewhat cramped accommodations within the town's palisade on the night of February 28.Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 98Melvoin, pp. 215‚Äì216 In addition to these men, the townspeople mustered about 70 men of fighting age; these forces were all under the command of Captain Jonathan Wells. =Organizing the raid= The Connecticut River valley had been identified as a potential raiding target by authorities in New France as early as 1702.Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 38 The forces for the raid had begun gathering near Montreal as early as May 1703, as reported with reasonable accuracy in English intelligence reports. However, two incidents delayed their execution of the raid. The first was a rumor that English warships were on the Saint Lawrence River, and the French sent a significant Indian force to Quebec for its defense. The second was the detachment of some troops for operations in Maine; critically, these forces included Jean-Baptiste Hertel de Rouville, who was intended to lead the raid on Deerfield. In addition, his raid against Wells raised the frontier alarms at Deerfield. Hertel de Rouville did not return to Montreal until the fall of 1703.Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 99 The force assembled at Chambly, just south of Montreal, numbered about 250. It was a diverse collection of men.Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 100 The 48 ethnic Frenchmen, were made up of Canadien militia and recruits from the troupes de la marine, including four of Hertel de Rouville's brothers.Calloway, p. 31 Several men among the French leadership had more than 20 years' experience in wilderness warfare. The Indian contingent included 200 Abenaki, Iroquois (likely Mohawk), Wyandot, and Pocumtuc, some of whom sought revenge for incidents by whites that had taken place years earlier. As the party moved south toward Deerfield in January and February 1704, this force was joined by another 30 to 40 Pennacook warriors led by the sachem Wattanummon, raising the troop size to nearly 300 by the time it reached the Deerfield area in late February.Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 111Calloway, p. 47 The expedition's departure was not a secret. In January 1704, Iroquois warned New York's Indian agent Pieter Schuyler of possible action by the French and their allies. He notified Governor Dudley and Connecticut's Governor Winthrop; they received further warnings in mid-February, although none was specific about the target.Haefeli and Sweeney, pp. 110‚Äì111 Raid Illustration depicting the raid, published 1900 The raiders left most of their equipment and supplies 25 to 30 miles (40 to 48 kilometers) north of the village before establishing a cold camp about from Deerfield on February 28, 1704. From this vantage point, they observed the villagers as they prepared for the night. Since the villagers had been alerted to the possibility of a raid, they all took refuge within the palisade, and a guard was posted.Melvoin, p. 216 The raiders had noticed that snow drifts extended to the top of the palisade; this simplified their entry into the fortifications just before dawn on February 29. They carefully approached the village, stopping periodically so that the sentry might confuse the noises they made with more natural sounds. A few men climbed over the palisade via the snow drifts and opened the north gate to admit the rest. Primary sources vary on the degree of alertness of the village guard that night; one account claims he fell asleep, while another claims that he discharged his weapon to raise the alarm when the attack began, but that it was not heard by many people.Melvoin, p. 217 As the Reverend John Williams later recounted, \\"with horrid shouting and yelling\\", the raiders launched their attack \\"like a flood upon us\\". The raiders' attack probably did not go exactly as they had intended. In attacks on Schenectady, New York and Durham, New Hampshire in the 1690s (both of which included Hertel de Rouville's father), the raiders had simultaneously attacked all of the houses. They did not do so at Deerfield. Historians Haefeli and Sweeney theorize that the failure to launch a coordinated assault was caused by the wide diversity within the attacking force.Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 113 Illustration by Howard Pyle showing the march to Canada The raiders swept into the village, and began attacking individual houses. Reverend Williams' house was among the first to be raided; Williams' life was spared when his gunshot misfired, and he was taken prisoner. Two of his children and a servant were slain; the rest of his family and his other servant were also taken prisoner.Melvoin, p. 218 Similar scenarios occurred in many of the other houses. The residents of Benoni Stebbins' house, which was not among the ones attacked early, resisted the raiders' attacks, which lasted until well after daylight. A second house, near the northwestern corner of the palisade, was also successfully defended. The raiders moved through the village, herding their prisoners to an area just north of the town, rifling houses for items of value, and setting a number of them on fire.Haefeli and Sweeney, pp. 115‚Äì119 As the morning progressed, some of the raiders began moving north with their prisoners, but paused about a mile north of the town to wait for those who had not yet finished in the village. The men in the Stebbins house kept the battle up for two hours; they were on the verge of surrendering when reinforcements arrived. Early in the raid, young John Sheldon managed to escape over the palisade and began making his way to nearby Hadley to raise the alarm. The fires from the burning houses had been spotted, and \\"thirty men from Hadley and Hatfield\\" rushed to Deerfield.Melvoin, p. 219 Their arrival prompted the remaining raiders to flee; some abandoned their weapons and other supplies in the rush.Melvoin, p. 220 The sudden departure of the raiders and the arrival of reinforcements raised the spirits of the beleaguered survivors. About 20 Deerfield men joined the Hadley men in chasing after the fleeing raiders. The English and the raiders skirmished in the meadows just north of the village, where the English reported \\"killing and wounding many of them\\". The English soon ran into an ambush set up by the raiders who had left the village earlier. Of the 50 or so men who gave chase, nine were killed and several more were wounded. After the ambush they retreated to the village, and the raiders headed north with their prisoners. As the alarm spread to the south, reinforcements continued to arrive in the village. By midnight, 80 men from Northampton and Springfield had arrived, and men from Connecticut swelled the force to 250 by the end of the next day. After debating over what action to take, they decided that the difficulties of pursuit were not worth the risks. Leaving a strong garrison in the village, most of the militia returned to their homes.Haefeli and Sweeney, pp. 121‚Äì122 The raiders destroyed 17 of the village's 41 homes, and looted many of the others. Of the 291 people in Deerfield on the night of the attack, only 126 remained in town the next day. They killed 44 residents of Deerfield: 10 men, 9 women, and 25 children, five garrison soldiers, and seven Hadley men.Melvoin, p. 221 Of those who died inside the village, 15 died of fire- related causes; most of the rest were killed by edged or blunt weapons.Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 122 The raid's casualties were dictated by the raiders' goals to intimidate the village and to take valuable captives to French Canada. A large portion of the slain were infant children, who were not likely to have survived the trip to Canada.Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 122. The raiders took 109 villagers captive; this represented forty per cent of the village population. They also took captive three Frenchmen who had been living among the villagers.Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 115 The raiders also suffered losses, although reports vary. New France's Governor-General Philippe de Rigaud Vaudreuil reported the expedition only lost 11 men, and 22 were wounded, including Hertel de Rouville and one of his brothers.Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 123 John Williams heard from French soldiers during his captivity that more than 40 French and Indian soldiers were lost; Haefeli and Sweeney believe the lower French figures are more credible, especially when compared to casualties incurred in other raids. A majority of the captives taken were women and children, as the French and Indian captors considered them more likely than adult males to successfully assimilate into native communities and a new life in French Canada.Melvoin, p. 481. Captivity and ransom For the 109 English captives, the raid was only the beginning of their troubles.Haefeli and Sweeney, pp 5 and 150. The raiders intended to take them to Canada, a journey, in the middle of winter. Many of the captives were ill-prepared for this, and the raiders were short on provisions. The raiders consequently engaged in a common practice: they killed those captives when it was clear they were unable to keep up. Williams commented on the savage cruelty of the Indian raiders; although most killings were \\"not random or wanton\\",Melvoin, p. 481. none of those killed would have \\"needed to\\" be killed had they not been taken in the first place. Most (though not all) of the slain were the slow and vulnerable who could not keep up with the party and would likely have died less quickly en route.Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 130. Only 89 of the captives survived the ordeal. Survival chances correlated with age and gender: infants and young children fared the worst, and older children and teenagers (all 21 of whom survived the ordeal) fared the best. Adult men fared better than adult women, especially pregnant women, and those with small children. In the first few days several of the captives escaped. Hertel de Rouville instructed Reverend Williams to inform the others that recaptured escapees would be tortured; there were no further escapes. (The threat was not an empty one -- it was known to have happened on other raids.)Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 127 The French leader's troubles were not only with his captives. The Indians had some disagreements among themselves concerning the disposition of the captives, which at times threatened to come to blows. A council held on the third day resolved these disagreements sufficiently that the trek could continue.Haefeli and Sweeney, pp. 130‚Äì135 Portrait believed to be of John Williams, c. 1707 On Sunday March 5, five days after the raid, the captors and their captives reached what is now Rockingham, Vermont. The captives asked for and were given permission to hold a worship service that Sunday, near the mouth of a river that was later named the Williams River in honor of that serviceHayes, Lyman S. 1907. History of the Town of Rockingham, Vermont: Including the Villages of Bellows Falls, Saxtons River, Rockingham, Cambridgeport and Bartonsville, 1753-1907, with Family Genealogies.

A historical marker was placed near the site in 1912. According to John Williams' account of his captivity, most of the party traveled up the frozen Connecticut River, then up the Wells River and down the Winooski River to Lake Champlain. From there they made their way to Chambly, at which point most of the force dispersed. The captives accompanied their captors to their respective villages.Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 129 Williams' wife Eunice, weak after having given birth just six weeks earlier, was one of the first to be killed during the trek; her body was recovered and reburied in the Deerfield cemetery.Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 128 Calls went out from the governors of the northern colonies for action against the French colonies. Governor Dudley wrote that \\"the destruction of Quebeck and Port Royal [would] put all the Navall stores into Her Majesty's hands, and forever make an end of an Indian War\\",Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 191 the frontier between Deerfield and Wells was fortified by upwards of 2,000 men,Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 190 and the bounty for Indian scalps was more than doubled, from ¬£40 to ¬£100.Melvoin, p. 229 Dudley promptly organized a retaliatory raid against Acadia (present-day Nova Scotia). In the summer of 1704, New Englanders under the leadership of Benjamin Church raided Acadian villages at Pentagouet (present-day Castine, Maine), Passamaquoddy Bay (present-day St. Stephen, New Brunswick), Grand Pr√©, Pisiquid, and Beaubassin (all in present-day Nova Scotia). Church's instructions included the taking of prisoners to exchange for those taken at Deerfield, and specifically forbade him to attack the fortified capital, Port Royal.Clark, p. 220 Deerfield and other communities collected funds to ransom the captives. French authorities and colonists also worked to extricate the captives from their Indian captors. Within a year's time, most of the captives were in French hands, a product of frontier commerce in humans that was fairly common at the time on both sides.Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 147 The French and converted Indians worked to convert their captives to Roman Catholicism, with modest success.Haefeli and Sweeney, pp. 157‚Äì163 While adult captives proved fairly resistant to proselytizing, children were more receptive or likely to accept conversion under duress.Melvoin, pp. 484-486. Some of the younger captives, however, were not ransomed, as they were adopted into the tribes. Such was the case with Williams' daughter Eunice, who was eight years old when captured. She became thoroughly assimilated in her Mohawk family, and married a Mohawk man when she was 16. She did not see her family of origin again until much later and always returned to Kahnawake. Other captives also remained by choice in Canadian and Native communities such as Kahnawake for the rest of their lives. Negotiations for the release and exchange of captives began in late 1704, and continued until late 1706. They became entangled in unrelated issues (like the English capture of French privateer Pierre Maisonnat dit Baptiste), and larger concerns, including the possibility of a wider-ranging treaty of neutrality between the French and English colonies.Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 165 Mediated in part by Deerfield residents John Sheldon and John Wells, some captives (including Noel Doiron) were returned to Boston in August 1706.Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 173 Governor Dudley, who may have needed the successful return of the captives for political reasons, then released the French captives, including Baptiste; the remaining captives who chose to return were back in Boston by November 1706.Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 174 Many of the younger captives were adopted into the Indian tribes or French Canadian society. Thirty six Deerfield captives, mostly children and teenagers at the time of the raid, remained permanently. Those who stayed were not compelled by force, but rather by newly formed religious ties and family bonds.Haefeli and Sweeney, pp. 157 and 207. Captive experience was possibly dictated by gender as well as age. Young women may have more easily and readily assimilated into Indian and French Canadian societies. Nine girls remained as opposed to only five boys. These choices may reflect the larger frontier pattern of incorporation of young women into Indian and Canadian society. It's theorised some young women remained, not because of compulsion, fascination with the outdoor adventure, or the strangeness of life in a foreign society, but because they transitioned into established lives in new communities and formed bonds of family, religion, and language.Haefeli and Sweeney, pp. 222-223. In fact, possibly more than half of young female captives who remained settled in Montreal where \\"the lives of these former Deerfield residents differed very little in their broad outlines from their former neighbors\\". Whether in New France or in Deerfield these women generally were part of frontier agricultural communities where they tended to marry in their early twenties and have six or seven children.Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 242. Other female captives remained in Native communities such as Kahnawake. These women remained because of bonds of religion and family. While European males castigated the slavery of English women, some captive women from this time chose to remain in Native society rather than return to colonial English settlements.Demos, p. 164.Another captive who choose to remain was Mary Harris who had been about 10 years old in the 1704 raid; in 1751 she was living in the Delaware town Gekelukpechink aka Newcomer's Town bear the site of Newcomerstown, Ohio Tuscarawas County Ohio. See Christopher Gist Journal January 14, 1751 Gist Journal .p.41 in 1756 she was reported living near an Indian village near Montreal Canada .pp.114-115. An oft repeated legend that Mary Harris was involved in the naming of Newcomerstown because of another white captive woman who killed Harris Indian husband see but see Gist's own Journal entries .p.39 and pp.114-115 John Williams wrote a captivity narrative, The Redeemed Captive Returning to Zion, about his experience, which was published in 1707. Williams' narrative was published during ongoing ransom negotiations and pressed for greater activity to return the Deerfield captives. Written with assistance from prominent Boston Puritan minister Reverend Cotton Mather, the book framed the raid, captivity, and border relations with the French and Indians in terms of providential history and God‚Äôs purpose for Puritans.Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 177. The work was widely distributed in the 18th and 19th centuries, and continues to be published today (see Further Reading below). Williams' work was one of the reasons this raid, unlike similar others of the time, was remembered and became an element in the American frontier story.Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 273 Williams' work transformed the captivity narrative into a celebration of individual heroism and the triumph of Protestant values against savage and \\"Popish\\" enemies.Haefeli and Sweeney, pp. 178-179 The last known survivor of the raid was ironically Williams daughter Eunice Kanenstenhawi Williams, also known as Marguerite Kanenstenhawi Arosen, (17 September 1696 Deerfield, Massachusetts-26 November 1785 Kahnawake, Quebec, Canada) Legacy and historical memory Deerfield holds a \\"special place in American history\\".Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 1. As Mary Rowlandson's popular captivity narrative The Sovereignty and Goodness of God did a generation earlier, the sensational tale stressed reliance on God's mercy and \\"kept alive the spirit of the Puritan mission\\" in eighteenth century New England. Williams' account heightened tensions between English settlers and Native Americans and their French allies and led to more war preparedness among settler communities.Melvoin, p. 508. The events at Deerfield were not commonly described as a massacre until the 19th century. Reverend John Taylor's 1804 centennial memorial sermon first termed the events at Deerfield a \\"massacre\\". Previous eighteenth-century accounts emphasized the physical destruction and described the raid as \\"the assault on\\", \\"the destruction of\\", or \\"mischief at\\" Deerfield.Haefeli and Sweeney, pp. 272-274. Viewing the raid as a \\"massacre\\", 19th century New Englanders began to remember the attack as part of the larger narrative and celebration of American frontier spirit. Persisting into the twentieth century, American historical memory has tended to view Deerfield in line with Frederick Turner's Frontier Thesis as a singular Indian attack against a community of individualistic frontiersmen.Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 18. Re-popularized and exposed to a national audience in the mid-twentieth century with the establishment of Historic Deerfield, the raid was contextualized in a celebration of exceptional American individual ambition. This view has served as a partial justification for the removal of Native Americans and has obscured both the larger patterns of border conflict and tensions and the family based structure of Deerfield and similar marginal settlements.Haefeli and Sweeney, pp. 273-274. Although popularly remembered as a tale of the triumph of rugged Protestant male individualism, the raid is better understood not along the lines of Turner's thesis, but as an account of the strong factors of community life and cross-cultural interaction in border communities.Melvoin, p. 598. An 1875 legend recounts the attack as an attempt by the French to regain a bell, supposedly destined for Quebec, but pirated and sold to Deerfield. The legend continues that this was a \\"historical fact known to almost all school children\\".Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 272. However, the story, which is a common Kahnawake tale, was refuted as early as 1882 and does not appear to have significantly affected American perception of the raid.Child, p. 23. Canadians and native Americans who are less influenced by Williams' narrative and Turner's thesis, have given the raid a more ambivalent place in memory. Canadians view the raid not as a massacre and mass abduction but as a successful local application of guerilla techniques in the broader context of international war and stress the successful integration of hundreds of captives taken in similar conflicts during Queen Anne's War. Similarly, most Native American records justify the action in a larger military and cultural context and remain largely unconcerned with the particular event.Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 274. A portion of the original village of Deerfield has been preserved as a living history museum, Historic Deerfield; among its relics is a door bearing tomahawk marks from the 1704 raid.Haefeli and Sweeney, pp. 273-274.Johnson and Smith, p. 44. The raid is commemorated there on the weekend closest to February 29. Moving towards a more inclusive Historic Deerfield's yearly reenactment and educational programs treat \\"massacre\\" as a \\"dirty word\\" and stress Deerfield as a place to study cultural interaction and difference at society's borders.Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 272.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 11, 1997. The episode centers on fictional pilot episodes of non-existent television series derived from The Simpsons, and is a parody of the tendency of networks to spin off characters from a hit series. As such it includes references to many different TV series. The first fictional spin-off is Chief Wiggum P.I., a cop-dramedy featuring Chief Wiggum and Seymour Skinner. The second is The Love-matic Grampa, a sitcom featuring Moe Szyslak who receives dating advice from Abraham Simpson, whose ghost is possessing a love testing machine. The final segment is The Simpson Family Smile-Time Variety Hour, a variety show featuring the Simpson family except for Lisa, who has been replaced. The episode was written by David S. Cohen, Dan Greaney and Steve Tompkins, with Ken Keeler coming up with the story and the general idea of intentionally bad writing. It was directed by Neil Affleck, and Tim Conway, Gailard Sartain and Phil Hartman guest-starred. The producers were initially uneasy about the episode, as they feared that the purposely bad writing would be mistaken for actual bad writing. The episode, however, now appears on several lists of the most popular Simpsons episodes. Plot Troy McClure hosts a television special from the \\"Museum of TV and Television\\" introducing three spin-off productions, created using characters from The Simpsons. The Fox network has only three programmes ‚Äî The Simpsons, The X Files and Melrose Place ‚Äî prepared for the next broadcasting season, and so commissions the producers of The Simpsons to create thirty-five new shows to fill the remainder of the lineup. Unable to handle such a workload, the producers create only three new shows. Chief Wiggum, P.I. is a crime-dramedy spin-off and a parody of Magnum, P.I., which follows Chief Wiggum, Ralph and Seymour Skinner. Chief Wiggum and his son Ralph move to New Orleans with Seymour Skinner as Wiggum's sidekick. Wiggum has proclaimed that he will \\"clean up the city\\" of New Orleans, but it does not take long before he meets his nemesis, Big Daddy, who warns Wiggum to stay out of his business. Soon after, Ralph is kidnapped and Wiggum finds Big Daddy's calling card left behind. Wiggum manages to track Big Daddy's ransom call to the Mardi Gras, where he briefly runs into the Simpson family, and the two chase each other to Big Daddy's mansion in the New Orleans bayou (in reality the Louisiana governor's mansion which Big Daddy has managed to steal). Chief Wiggum then threatens Big Daddy with a gun, but Big Daddy counters by tossing Ralph at his father, then jumping out the window and swimming away (at an extremely slow speed, due to his weight). Wiggum ultimately lets the villain escape, feeling that he will meet him again \\"each and every week,\\" a riff on serialized, weekly television dramas. The Love-matic Grampa is a sitcom about Moe's love life, a parody of My Mother the Car. He receives advice from the ghost of Abraham Simpson, who was crushed by a store shelf containing cans of figs that toppled on him and subsequently \\"while travelling up toward Heaven...got lost along the way\\" and now possesses Moe's love tester machine. Moe ends up getting a date he meets at the bar. On Grampa's advice he takes his date out to a French restaurant and hides the Love Tester in the bathroom so he can get advice while at the restaurant. After Kearney, Dolph and Jimbo whack the machine because it said they were gay, it malfunctions and advises Moe to tell his date that \\"her rump's as big as the Queen's, and twice as fragrant.\\" Moe returns with a bowl of snails dumped on his head and his dependence on the machine is revealed, so he confesses to receiving advice. His date is actually happy when she hears this, flattered that Moe would go to all that trouble for her. Grampa asks to be introduced to an attractive payphone in front of the restaurant, much to the mirth of Moe and his date. The Simpson Family Smile-Time Variety Hour is a variety show featuring various songs and sketches in a parody of The Brady Bunch Hour and Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In. It features Homer, Marge, Bart, and Maggie. Lisa refuses to participate, but is replaced by an attractive, teenaged blonde bombshell. After the introduction there is a sketch, where the family are portrayed as beavers living in a dam with Tim Conway as a skunk and Homer's boss. The show ends with a medley of songs about candy sung by the family, Jasper Beardley and Waylon Smithers. Troy ends the special with a look at the upcoming season of The Simpsons, filled with ridiculous plot twists, such as Homer turning Lisa into a frog using magical powers, the discovery of Bart's two long-lost identical twin brothers (one African-American, the other a cowboy), Selma marrying Lenny, Bumblebee Man, and Itchy (in succession), and Homer meeting an alien named Ozmodiar whom only he can see. Production Tim Conway appears as himself in the episode's third segment. Ken Keeler came up with the idea for the episode from the one sentence statement: \\"Let's do spin- offs\\". His idea was to use intentionally bad writing and \\"crazy plots\\", which underlines their critique of spin-offs in general.Alberti, pp. 155-156 After he had pitched the idea it was decided that \\"it was an idea that ought to work pretty well\\" and production went ahead. Creator Matt Groening was uneasy about the idea, feeling that it could be mistranslated as actually bad sitcom writing. He also did not like the idea of breaking the fourth wall and the concept of saying that the Simpsons were just actors in a television show. The idea was later explored in the season 11 episode \\"Behind the Laughter\\". One of the \\"crazy\\" ideas was the inclusion of the character of Ozmodiar, who was originally included in the script for an earlier episode but was considered too ridiculous for the time. When this episode came along the character seemed to fit with the story and was included. Even though Keeler came up with the story, David S. Cohen, Dan Greaney and Steve Tompkins wrote the scripts for the three segments. Cohen wrote Chief Wiggum P.I., Greaney wrote Love-matic Grampa and Tompkins wrote The Simpson Family Smile-Time Variety Hour. The episode demanded a different approach to directing than a usual The Simpsons episode. Director Neil Affleck had to animate each segment so that it fit the style of the show it parodied. The Love-matic Grampa segment for instance emulates a three camera setup, as is normally used in sitcoms. Three guest stars appear in the episode; Phil Hartman as Troy McClure, Tim Conway as himself and Gailard Sartain as Big Daddy. McClure is used as a host of the episode, something he had previously done in the episode \\"The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular\\". Conway appears as himself. Conway, a comic veteran, is known for his work on The Carol Burnett Show, which has a similar format to The Simpson Family Smile-Time Variety Hour.Alberti, pp. 158-159 Due to Lisa being substituted for an older teenager (voiced by Pamela Hayden) in the third segment, Yeardley Smith has only one line in the entire episode. =Proposed real spin-offs= Over the course of the show, the staff have considered producing several spin-off television series and films, based on The Simpsons. In 1994, Matt Groening pitched a live-action spin-off from The Simpsons that centered on Krusty the Clown and would star Dan Castellaneta in the role, reprising the character from The Simpsons. He and Michael Weithorn wrote a pilot script where Krusty moved to Los Angeles and got his own talk show. A recurring joke throughout the script was that Krusty lived in a house on wooden stilts which were continuously being gnawed by beavers. Eventually, the contract negotiations fell apart and Groening decided to stop work on the project. \\"22 Short Films About Springfield\\" sparked the idea amongst the staff for a spin-off series entitled Tales from Springfield. The proposed show would focus on the town in general, rather than the Simpson family. Every week would be a different scenario: three short stories, an adventure with young Homer or a story about a background character that was not tied into the Simpson family at all. The idea never came to anything, as Groening realized that the staff did not have the manpower to produce another show as well as The Simpsons. The staff believe it is something that they would still be interested in doing, and that it \\"could happen someday.\\" Groening also expressed a wish to make Simpstasia, a parody of Fantasia, but it was never produced, partly because it would have been too difficult to write a feature-length script, although a similar idea did appear in the episode Itchy and scratchy land Before his murder, Phil Hartman had said he had wished to make a live-action Troy McClure film, and several of the show's staff had expressed a desire to help create it. Groening later told Empire that the idea never \\"got further than enthusiasm\\", but \\"would have been really fun\\". Cultural references The entire episode is a satire of unoriginal, poor television writing and references and parodies many television series. When Troy McClure mentions that Fox can only fill up three slots for the next season, the three series are Melrose Place, The X-Files and The Simpsons itself. In the museum of television, Troy walks by posters of spin-offs, such as The Ropers (spun off from Three's Company), Laverne & Shirley (spun off from Happy Days), Rhoda, a show that Julie Kavner, the voice of Marge, once starred in, (spun off from The Mary Tyler Moore Show) and Fish (spun off from Barney Miller),Alberti, p. 154 to demonstrate the power of spin-offs. Troy walks by a poster of The Jeffersons (a spin-off of All in the Family) twice, because the writers could not think of any more spin-offs. The character Big Daddy is based on New Orleans musician Dr. John. Chief Wiggum, P.I. is a parody of police-dramas, such as Miami Vice, Magnum, P.I. and Starsky and Hutch. Skinner emulates Don Johnson from Miami Vice in order to look scruffier. The character of Big Daddy is based on Dr. John, who comes from New Orleans. The chef in the restaurant resembles Paul Prudhomme.http://www.tv.com/shows/the-simpsons/the-simpsons- spin-off-showcase-1462/ The Love-matic Grampa is a parody of fantasy sitcoms such as Mister Ed, I Dream of Jeannie and Bewitched as well as having similarities to My Mother the Car. The Love-matic Grampa machine singing \\"Daisy Bell\\" in a distorted manner when its electrical circuits are failing is a reference to HAL from the 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey. Grampa also references All Quiet on the Western Front, when Moe says he \\"wrote the book on love\\". Moe's date, Betty, looks somewhat like Tress MacNeille, the actress who voiced her. The Simpson Family Smile-Time Variety Hour is a parody of the 1960s and 1970s live variety shows. Mainly it is a parody of The Brady Bunch Hour, a short-lived spin-off of the 1970s sitcom The Brady Bunch. The replacement of Lisa in the third segment with another girl reflects the recasting of Jan Brady in the Brady Bunch Hour when Eve Plumb refused to participate.Alberti, pp. 156-157 The Simpson family is made to look like The Partridge Family. Also, the segment holds numerous references to Laugh-In. Kent Brockman introduces the show from inside a broadcast booth in a style similar to Laugh-In, there is a joke wall similar to the one in Laugh-In where The Sea Captain opens a porthole. There is also a Laugh-In-like montage wherein other characters comment on the skit itself. When Hans Moleman reads a poem, it is based on Henry Gibson reading a poem on Laugh-In. Other shows parodied during the variety show include The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour, and The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour. The songs parodied during the third segment are: * \\"I Want Candy\\" by The Strangeloves, performed by the Simpson family. * \\"Peppermint Twist\\" by Joey Dee and the Starliters, performed by Bart, \\"Lisa\\" and Maggie. * \\"Lollipop\\" by Ronald & Ruby, performed by Jasper Beardley. * \\"Whip It\\" by Devo, performed by Waylon Smithers. In the planned future for the show, Homer meets a green space alien named Ozmodiar that only he can see. This is a reference to The Great Gazoo, a character added into some of the final episodes of The Flintstones.Alberti, p. 160 Reception In its original American broadcast, \\"The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase\\" finished 61st place in the weekly ratings for the week of May 5‚ÄìMay 11, 1997 with a Nielsen rating of 7.3. It was the seventh-highest-rated show on the Fox network that week. Even though Troy mentions that The Simpsons, Melrose Place, and The X-Files are the only shows worth a slot in the next season's lineup, three other Fox shows actually did better than The Simpsons that week. These were Beverly Hills, 90210, King of the Hill, and Married... with Children. Matt Groening feared that the fans would interpret the episode in a negative light and was uneasy about the episode when it was in production. He later went on to say that the episode \\"turned out great\\". The writers of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood called it, \\"A very clever spin on the alternates offered by the Treehouse of Horrors run. Each of the spin-offs is very clever in its own way.\\" It has also appeared as one of the favorite episodes on a number of \\"best of\\" lists. Entertainment Weekly placed the episode 19th in their top 25 Simpsons episode list. In an interview for Star-News, The Simpsons writer Don Payne revealed that the episode was in his personal top six of the best The Simpsons episodes. Additionally, Gary Mullinax, a staff writer for The News Journal, picked the episode as part of his top-ten list.

Its key signature has six sharps and one double sharp (or eight sharps).

Its parallel major, E-sharp major, is usually replaced by F major, due to the presence of 4 double-sharps in the E-sharp major scale causing it to be one of the more impractical key signatures in music to use. Although E-sharp minor is usually notated as F minor, it could be used on a local level, such as bars 17 to 22 in Johann Sebastian Bach's The Well-Tempered Clavier, Book 1, Prelude and Fugue No. 3 in C-sharp major. (E-sharp minor is the mediant minor key of C-sharp major.)

On his appointment in January 1863, at the age of 65, Smith was the oldest Confederate general to hold field command in the war. Early and family life Smith was born in Marengo, (then Richmond County, Virginia now King George County, Virginia) to Mary Waugh Smith (1775-1811) (born at \\"Mt. Eccentric\\" in Fauquier County) and her cousin and husband Caleb Smith (1761-1814). His maternal grandfather (also William Smith, served in the local militia and was wounded in Lord Dunmore's War. His paternal grandfather Thomas Smith (1739-1801) had fought in the American Revolutionary War (and overwintered at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania). His uncle Col. Austin Smith served in the War of 1812 then represented King George County in the Virginia House of Delegates in 1814, 1821 and 1822.Lucy Montgomery Smith Price, The Sydney-Smith and Clagett-Price Geneaology (Strasburg, Shenandoah Publishing House 1927) pp.50-54 His mother's Doniphan ancestor had emigrated before 1663 and their joint ancestor, British naval officer Sir Sydney Smith emigrated circa 1720. The future governor had either six or seven siblings, including Rev. Thomas Smith (1799-1847) who was a minister at Smithfield, Virginia and later Parkersburg, West Virginia, and James Madison Smith (1808-1853).Lucy M.S. Price, pp.46-47 Billie Smith attended private school in Virginia and Plainfield Academy in Connecticut, then returned to Virginia to read law. In 1820, he married Elizabeth Hansbrough Bell, of a similar social class. They would have eleven children, several of whom died in infancy or as young adults. Their son William Henry (1824-1850) was lost at sea and James Caleb Smith (1822-1856) would be admitted to the bar in California but die in Nicauragua.Memoirs of William C.Smith available online Their sons Austin Smith (1829- ), Thomas Smith (1836-1918) and Frederick Waugh Smith (1843-1928) would enlist in the Confederate States Army, and each for a time fought under their father. After the war Col. Thomas Smith would marry a Virginia judge's daughter, become U.S. Attorney for the Territory of New Mexico and Chief Justice of the territory's supreme court, before returning to Virginia. His brother Capt. Frederick Smith would move to South Africa and also live to old age.https://archivesweb.vmi.edu/rosters/record.php?ID=1427 His nephew Caleb Smith (1824-1874; Rev. Thomas Smith's son) would resign his U.S. Army commission to fight for the confederacy and be wounded at Bull Run. His brother-in-law Peter Hansbrough Bell was a Texas Revolutionary and Mexican War veteran who served as the third Governor of Texas from 1849 through 1853. His cousin William Waugh Smith (1845-1912) would fight for the Confederacy then become president of Randolph Macon College and found Randolph College, a women's college near Lynchburg.Appleton's Cyclopedia vol. V, p. 594 Career Smith was admitted to the bar and commenced practice in Culpeper, Culpeper County, Virginia, in 1818. About a decade later, in 1827, Smith established a line of United States mail and passenger post coaches through Virginia, then expanded the business into the Carolinas and Georgia in 1831. It was in this role that he received his nickname. Given a contract by the administration of President Andrew Jackson to deliver mail between Washington, D.C., and Milledgeville, Georgia (then the state capital), Smith extended it with numerous spur routes, all generating extra fees. During an investigation of the Post Office Department, Smith's extra fees were publicized by U.S. Senator Benjamin W. Leigh, and he became known as \\"Extra Billy\\" in both the North and South. Smith owned 10 slaves in the 1840 census.1840 U.S. Federal Census for Culpeper County, Virginia p. 60 and 61 of 73 Interested in politics and a Democrat, Smith won election to the Senate of Virginia from the Piedmont district consisting of Culpeper, Madison, Orange, Rappahannock and Greene counties, and served from 1836 to 1841. He resigned during his second term, having successfully contested the election of Linn Banks to the Twenty-seventh Congress. Thus Smith served one term, from March 4, 1841, to March 3, 1843 but failed to win reelection in 1842 to the Twenty-eighth Congress. He then moved to Fauquier County. Elected by legislators as Governor of Virginia in 1845, Smith served from 1846 to 1849, during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, but failed to earn legislative approval necessary for election to the United States Senate during that period. As his gubernatorial term ended and consecutive terms were forbidden, Smith moved to California in April 1849 after the California Gold Rush and was president of the first Democratic state convention in 1850.Appleton p. 594 Smith soon returned to Virginia and in December 1852 was elected to the Thirty-third Congress and to the three succeeding Congresses (March 4, 1853 ‚Äì March 3, 1861). Although chosen for the Confederate States Congress, he resigned in 1862 in favor of military service. He was again elected governor in 1863 (this time by popular election in Confederate-held territory) and served until the end of the war.Appleton's p. 594 =Electoral history= *1853; Smith was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives with 51.79% of the vote, defeating Whig Edgar Snowden. *1855; Smith was re-elected with 78.01% of the vote, defeating Independents P. Johnson Barbour and David Funsten. *1857; Smith was re-elected with 57.5% of the vote, defeating now- American Snowden. *1859; Smith was re-elected with 49.36% of the vote, defeating Independent Democrats Henry Wirtz Thomas and Henry Shackleford. *1863; Smith was elected Governor of Virginia with 47.77% of the vote, defeating fellow Conservative Democrats Thomas Stanhope Flournoy and George W. Munford. Civil War When Virginia seceded from the Union, Smith declined to accept a commission as a brigadier general because he rightly admitted he was \\"wholly ignorant of drill and tactics\\". A few weeks after the war started, he was present during a Union cavalry charge at the Battle of Fairfax Court House (June 1861). He took command of the Confederate troops after the death of their commander John Quincy Marr and found he enjoyed the experience. He requested a commission and was appointed colonel of the 49th Virginia Infantry regiment just three days before the First Battle of Bull Run, where the regiment and new commander performed well. General William Smith Smith served in the Confederate Congress in 1862 but returned to the 49th Virginia at the start of the Peninsula Campaign. He was wounded at the Battle of Seven Pines and his regiment received favorable notice in his commander's report. During the Seven Days Battles the regiment was lightly engaged, but he and his command again were described as having \\"characteristic coolness\\" and \\"fearlessness.\\" He was known for expressing contempt for West Point graduates (\\"West P'inters\\") and their formal tactics, recommending common sense to his men instead of a military education, and distinguished himself with his unorthodox field uniform, including a tall beaver hat and a blue cotton umbrella. At the Battle of Antietam, Smith temporarily commanded a brigade in Maj. Gen. Jubal Early's division. He was wounded three times but continued to command, and Maj. Gen. J. E. B. Stuart wrote that he was \\"conspicuously brave and self-possessed.\\" By the end of the battle, he had to be carried from the field. In recognition of his performance, he was promoted to brigadier general as of January 31, 1863. He commanded a brigade in the Battle of Chancellorsville but achieved no distinction in this role. By the time of the Gettysburg Campaign, Smith's superiors were leery of his performance, but had to maintain some degree of support, since he was the former governor and at the time the governor-elect of Virginia. Early directed Brig. Gen. John B. Gordon to keep close contact with Smith and effectively exercise a joint command over their two brigades. During the Battle of Gettysburg, Smith refused to pursue retreating Union XI Corps troops, concerned that a Union force was approaching from his left, which was a significant reason that the Confederates failed to attack and take Cemetery Hill on July 1, 1863. Smith was the oldest general on the field and fought (unsuccessfully) the oldest Union general, Brig. Gen. George S. Greene, at Culp's Hill on July 3, 1863. He was the only general not commended in Early's official report and, as a result, decided to resign his commission on July 10. He nevertheless received an essentially honorary promotion to major general and Assistant Inspector General on August 12 and performed recruiting duty in Virginia. Postbellum career Before the Gettysburg Campaign, Smith was elected again as Governor of Virginia and served from January 1, 1864, to the end of the war. He was among the first Southern governors to advocate arming blacks to provide manpower for the Confederacy, and he occasionally returned to the field to command troops in the defense of Richmond. He was removed from office and arrested on May 9, 1865, but was paroled on June 8. He returned to his estate, \\"Monte Rosa\\" (later renamed \\"Neptune Lodge\\") near Warrenton, Virginia, where he engaged in agricultural pursuits. At the age of eighty, he became a member of the Virginia House of Delegates (1877-79). He died in Warrenton and was buried in Hollywood Cemetery, Richmond, Virginia.

Along with the neighbouring fells of Harrison Stickle and Pike of Stickle it forms the picturesque Langdale Pikes, which when viewed from the area around Elterwater village gives one of the best-known views in the National Park. Topography The Langdale Pikes form a parapet to the lower hinterland to their north. From 'behind' they are unimpressive, but their southern faces fall full length over crags to the floor of Langdale, nearly 2,000 ft below. Loft Crag has a peaked summit which apes in lesser proportion the fine knoll of Pike of Stickle. To the east, between Loft Crag and Harrison Stickle is the subsidiary top of Thorn Crag. This is sometimes counted as a Langdale Pike in its own right, but only Birkett amongst the major guidebooks takes this view.Bill Birkett: Complete Lakeland Fells: Collins Willow (1994): Ascents Loft Crag has an altitude of 2,238 ft (682 metres). It lies between Harrison Stickle and Pike o‚Äô Stickle and is usually climbed in conjunction with these two peaks. The starting place for the direct ascent of the fell is The New Dungeon Ghyll Hotel in Great Langdale. A path leads north-westerly across the hillside passing Dungeon Ghyll Force waterfall and going between Thorn Crag and Gimmer Crag to a col between Loft Crag and Harrison Stickle. From there it is a straightforward climb to the summit. A more circuitous ascent can be undertaken from the same starting point but taking the well trodden (and repaired) path up Stickle Ghyll to Stickle Tarn. From here the fells of Pavey Ark and Thunacar Knott can be climbed before tackling the three Langdale Pikes.Alfred Wainwright: Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, Book 3 The Central Fells: Westmorland Gazette (1958): Mark Richards: The Central Fells: Collins (2003): Summit and Gimmer Crag Loft Crag is a fine viewpoint which gives an attractive vista of the fells around Great Langdale. Because the fell juts further out into the valley than the other two Langdale Pikes, it gives a more impressive and full view of the valley. The fell has a small sharp summit below which rises Gimmer Crag, which is one of the top rock climbing venues in the Lake District. The crag is made of volcaniclastic siltstone and mudstone.

When an isotope decays into a very short-lived isotope and then decays again to a relatively long- lived isotope, the products of the second decay are delayed. The short-lived isotope is usually a meta-stable nuclear isomer. For example, gallium-73 decays via beta decay into germanium-73m2, which is short-lived (499ms). The germanium isotope emits two weak gamma rays and a conversion electron. : ‚Üí + 2 + ; ‚Üí + (53.4 keV) + (13.3 keV) + Because the middle isotope is so short- lived, the gamma rays are considered part of the gallium decay. Therefore, the above equations are combined. : ‚Üí + 4 + 2 However, since there is a short time delay between the beta decay and the high energy gamma emissions and the third and fourth gamma rays, it is said that the lower energy gamma rays are delayed. Delayed gamma emissions are the most common form of delayed radiation but are not the only form. It is common for the short-lived isotopes to have delayed emissions of various particles. In these cases it is commonly called a beta-delayed emission. This is because the decay is delayed until a beta decay takes place. For instance nitrogen-17 emits two beta-delayed neutrons after its primary beta emission. Just as in the above delayed gamma emission, the nitrogen is not the actual source of the neutrons, a short lived isotope of oxygen is.

Born in Melville, Saskatchewan, he received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Manitoba in 1929 and a Bachelor of Law degree from the University of Saskatchewan in 1932. He was called to Bar of Saskatchewan in 1933. From 1933 to 1940, he practised law in Melville, Saskatchewan with the law firm Kanee & Deroche. During World War II, he served with the Canadian Army in Europe and the South Pacific. He was discharged with the rank of Major. He and his wife Florence had one son, Stephen, now resident in Minneapolis. After the war, he practised law in Winnipeg, Manitoba with the law firm, Shinbane, Dorfman & Kanee, until 1965. He was the owner and President of Soo Line Mills, which he took over after his father's death, and several other businesses in Winnipeg. Under his supervision, in 1955, the Soo Line Milling Company switched from conveyor belt operation to a pneumatic drive; this was the first flour mill to make this switch in the Western hemisphere. In addition to his national and international contributions, Sol Kanee worked hard to improve his city, Winnipeg. There, he chaired the Community Welfare Planning Council, and worked tirelessly for a variety of organisations, including the Society for Crippled Children and Adults, the United Way, the Royal Winnipeg Ballet (which he helped lift from obscurity), the Board of Governors of the University of Manitoba (of which he was chair) and the Sharon Home. Sol Kanee devoted much of his energy toward improving the status of Jews around the world. He rose through the ranks to become president of the Canadian Jewish Congress from 1971 to 1974, and worked on the executive of the World Jewish Congress. He passionately supported and advocated on behalf of the state of Israel, and using his connections in Canadian politics, he convinced C.D. Howe not only to sell arms to Israel, but to do so at discounted rates; he later procured planes and cargo to supply relief to the young country. His other, international humanitarian projects included fighting to secure reparations from Germany and persuading the Russian government to ease its restriction on Russian Jews emigrating to Israel. Sol Kanee's immense contributions to Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada and the world earned him several important distinctions, including the Centennial of Canada Medal in 1967, an Honorary Doctor of Laws from the University of Manitoba in 1974, the Canadian Jewish Congress Samuel Bronfman Medal in 1978, the International B'nai Brith Humanitarian Award in 1979 and the Nahum Goldmann Medal in 1995. The Winnipeg Jewish Community Council created the Sol Kanee Distinguished Service Medal in 1994, his long-time friend Arthur Mauro founded the Sol Kanee Lecture on International Peace and Justice in 2002, and the Jewish Heritage Centre of Western Canada created the Sol & Florence Kanee Distinguished Lecture Series in 2004. He was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1977 and was awarded the Order of Manitoba for his \\"unparalleled record of service to Winnipeg and Canada‚Äôs Jewish community\\" in 2000.

His detailed and accurate maps of the Shenandoah Valley are credited by many as a principal factor in Confederate General Stonewall Jackson's victories in the Valley Campaign of 1862. Early life Hotchkiss was born in Windsor, New York. He graduated from the Windsor Academy and, by the age of 18, he was teaching school himself in Lykens Valley, Pennsylvania. The following year he relocated to the Shenandoah Valley and opened the Mossy Creek Academy in Augusta County. He supplemented his income as a schoolteacher by working as a mining geologist. As he explored the beautiful area around his new home he began his hobby (and minor business) of mapmaking that would dominate the rest of his life. In 1853 he married a woman from Pennsylvania named Sara Ann Comfort and together they had two daughters. In 1855 Hotchkiss and his brother Nelson founded the Loch Willow Academy school for boys in Churchville, Virginia. His birthplace, known as the Jedediah Hotchkiss House, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Civil War Near the end of June, 1861, Hotchkiss signed on as a Confederate teamster to take supplies to the Churchville Cavalry at Rich Mountain, West Virginia. Hotchkiss offered his services as a mapmaker to Brig. Gen. Richard B. Garnett, whose Confederate brigade was operating in western Virginia. Hotchkiss served at Rich Mountain and created maps for General Robert E. Lee's planned campaign in the mountains. He took a brief medical leave after being stricken with typhoid fever, but returned to duty in March 1862 as chief topographical engineer of the Valley District, reporting to Maj. Gen. Stonewall Jackson.He is sometimes referred to as \\"Major Hotchkiss\\" (such as by his Civil War Trust online biography), but his biography in McElfresh (p. 243) states he was \\"plain Mr. Hotchkiss, a hired civilian topographical engineer.\\" Robertson, pp. 336-37, refers to Hotchkiss is a member of Jackson's staff, but does not list any military rank. Hearn and Marino, p. 8, state that while Hotchkiss never became an officer, he received the pay of a lieutenant in 1861, captain in 1862-64, and major in 1865, and that he never wore a military uniform. The NPS Soldiers and Sailors Database lists Hotchkiss as a topographical engineer, without rank. On March 26, 1862, Jackson summoned Hotchkiss to his headquarters and directed him to \\"make me a map of the Valley, from Harper's Ferry to Lexington, showing all the points of offence and defence [sic] in those places.\\" The Shenandoah Valley had never been mapped in detail before. Running 150 miles in length and 25 miles wide, it was a daunting task, but Hotchkiss accepted the assignment, and worked on the map for the remainder of the war. In order to accommodate his large scale of 1:80,000, he glued together three portions of tracing linen to form a large single map of 7 feet by 3 feet.Hearn and Marino, p. 10. McElfresh, p. 27, states that the map was 4.5 √ó 9 feet, and that the grid lines that run through it clearly indicate that it was used to also prepare smaller tactical, or route, maps. One of Hotchkiss's maps: Valley Campaign of 1864 for Jubal Early Captain Hotchkiss served under Jackson for the rest of the general's life. Producing large volumes of accurate, detailed, and even beautiful maps, he also aided the general by personally directing troop movements across the terrain with which he had become so familiar. Jackson's reputation for lightning movements and surprise attacks, befuddling his enemies, owes much to Hotchkiss's cartography. Together they served in the Valley Campaign, the Northern Virginia Campaign (including Cedar Mountain, the Second Battle of Bull Run, and Chantilly), the Maryland Campaign (including Harpers Ferry and Antietam), and the Battle of Fredericksburg. At the Battle of Chancellorsville in May 1863, Jackson asked Hotchkiss for eight maps of the area west of Fredericksburg and, along with local residents, discovered the route that Jackson's corps took in the famous flanking march against the Union army.Robertson, p. 703. That night, Jackson was mortally wounded and died less than two weeks later. After his general's death, Hotchkiss continued to be assigned to the staff of the corps commanders who succeeded Jackson (Generals Richard S. Ewell and Jubal A. Early), but he was frequently called upon to work directly for General Robert E. Lee at the headquarters of the Army of Northern Virginia. Balancing these dual responsibilities, he served through the Gettysburg Campaign, the Mine Run Campaign, and the Overland Campaign. In June 1864 he accompanied General Early on his raid through the Shenandoah Valley toward Washington, D.C., and one of his maps contributed to Early's successful surprise attack against General Philip Sheridan at the Battle of Cedar Creek (although the map was not able to prevent Early's decisive defeat by the end of the battle). He then returned to the Siege of Petersburg with the remnants of Early's defeated army for the remainder of the war. After General Lee's surrender at Appomattox Court House in April 1865, Hotchkiss surrendered to the Union Army. General Ulysses S. Grant had Hotchkiss released from custody and returned his maps to him. Grant paid Hotchkiss for permission to use some of his maps in his reports and almost all of the Confederate maps in the Official Records produced by the U.S. War Department were those drawn by him. Postbellum career As a civilian again, Hotchkiss returned to Staunton, Virginia, reopened his school, and was involved in economic activities designed to promote the recovery of the war-ravaged Shenandoah Valley and in veterans' affairs. After teaching school, he opened an office as a civil and mining consulting engineer and, being so familiar with the geography of the state, was able to steer lucrative foreign and Northern investments to the most appropriate places. In October, 1865, a Federal detective confronted Hotchkiss with a military order to confiscate his map collection. Hotchkiss refused to obey the order, and instead took some maps to Richmond for examination by army engineers. Despite Federal pressure, he was able to retain ownership of all his maps, while preparing maps of Virginia counties for the United States Army. Hotchkiss collaborated in the writing of the 12-volume Confederate Military History, writing the 1,295-page Virginia volume himself. His journals were edited in 1973 by Archie P. MacDonald and published under the title Make Me a Map of the Valley: The Civil War Journal of Stonewall Jackson's Cartographer. Hotchkiss's sketchbooks, diaries, and maps are available at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. Jedediah Hotchkiss died at his home in Staunton at age 71. He is buried there in Thornrose Cemetery. The small town of Hotchkiss, West Virginia, in Raleigh County was named for him. The magnificent Queen Anne- and Eastlake-style mansion Hotchkiss built in 1888 at 437 East Beverley Street, Staunton, Virginia, still stands. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and Virginia Landmark Register as The Oaks. It is currently in private ownership after a sale in February 2019 by the family that purchased it from the Hotchkiss heirs in 1948.437 E Beverley St Staunton, VA 24401 Zillow.com, accessed 23 July 2019. The Hotchkiss map collection The Hotchkiss collection contains over 600 maps primarily relating to the Virginias between 1861 and 1865. Some of the maps are from his post-war work, some are of individual estates, and some are source maps made by others. The map collection was retained by his family following his death and refusal of the Federal confiscation order. C. Vernon Eddy, librarian of the Handley Regional Library in Winchester, Virginia made arrangements for the listing and safe- keeping of the maps in specially-made aluminum tubes, before they were finally given to the Library of Congress in 1948, who then published the maps in 1951. Three of the original maps were donated by the Hotchkiss family to the Handley Library: a Route Map of Gettysburg Campaign, a Sketch of the Battle of Winchester [First], and a Sketch of the Second Battle of Winchester. The Jedediah Hotchkiss Papers are available in the Stewart Bell Jr. Archives Room through the Winchester-Frederick County Historical Society at Handley Regional Library in Winchester, Virginia.

Detective Greg MacAleese was investigating the murder of a gas station attendant, Michael Carmen, in Albuquerque, New Mexico in 1976 when he came up with the idea.. At the time, Albuquerque had one of the highest per capita crime rates in the US. Its crime rate has since improved.Crime Stoppers International - Our History Retrieved 2008-06-01. Crime Stoppers in Canada In Canada, a Supreme Court of Canada decision R. v . Leipert, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 281 ruled unanimously that police do not have to disclose any information they receive from this internationally recognized crime prevention program. : Thus a phone number was developed, 705-497-5555 Crime Stoppers Barbados In 2009, it was revealed that information from Crime Stoppers had resulted in 18 arrests, 34 charges and 23 cases cleared for the year.

The name of the stable was invented by Jason Hervey and was inspired by and intended as a mockery of the famous New World Order (nWo). History =Concept= The LWO was formed in late 1998 after Eddie Guerrero's spat with WCW head Eric Bischoff, a real-life conflict that was turned into a storyline.Guerrero, Eddie. Cheating Death, Stealing Life: The Eddie Guerrero Story, p. 169‚Äì171. The group was the idea of Jason Hervey, a friend of Bischoff. The stable was originally supposed to revolve around Konnan, but it was given to Guerrero after Konnan joined the nWo Wolfpac. =Beginnings= On August 17, Guerrero gave a shoot, where he claimed to want out of his contract. After being taken off television for several weeks, Guerrero returned on the October 5 edition of WCW Monday Nitro, forming the LWO with several other Mexican wrestlers.Guerrero, Eddie. Cheating Death, Stealing Life: The Eddie Guerrero Story, p. 172‚Äì173. The group consisted of the majority of the Mexican roster, as well as Guerrero's friend Art Flores, who played the role of a bodyguard named Spyder. The group consisted of almost every major Mexican wrestler on the WCW roster including Psychosis, La Parka, Hector Garza, and Juventud Guerrera. Their main feud lied with Rey Mysterio, Jr., after he refused to join the group.Guerrero, Eddie. Cheating Death, Stealing Life: The Eddie Guerrero Story, p. 174‚Äì175. They also feuded with Billy Kidman, Mysterio's on-and-off American tag team partner. Mysterio was forced to become a member after losing a match to Eddie Guerrero. Chavo Guerrero, Jr. attempted to join several times, but Eddie did not allow him to become a member since Chavo was (kayfabe) mentally unstable at the time and carried around a wooden horse named Pep√©. =Demise and aftermath= A car accident suffered by Guerrero on January 1, 1999 would help bring a premature end to the LWO.Guerrero, Eddie. Cheating Death, Stealing Life: The Eddie Guerrero Story, p. 181. Three days later, the two factions of the New World Order reunited, and before long, various members of the LWO were found lying unconscious backstage. The nWo approached the LWO and demanded they immediately disband or face further consequences. The next week Ric Flair also asked the LWO to disband and fight for WCW promising he would treat them better than Bischoff did and also promising them money, women and limousines. Every member other than Mysterio agreed, removing their LWO shirts and exiting the ring. Mysterio, who was not originally a willing member of the group, proved himself the most loyal when he refused to remove his LWO colors. The nWo beat him down and forcibly tore off his LWO shirt, leading to a feud between Mysterio and The Outsiders. The reunited nWo also betrayed their only Latino member, Konnan, who had objected to the brutality used against Mysterio, leading them to form a team against The Outsiders. As Eddie Guerrero healed and made his in-ring return, key LWO members such as himself, Mysterio, and Juventud Guerrera formed a popular new group with Konnan known as The Filthy Animals.

The shoulder straps on some dresses may be very thin, in which case they may be called a spaghetti strap (also called \\"noodle strap\\"). These are common in clothing such as camisoles, cocktail dresses, and evening gowns.

Many military uniform shirts, jackets, tunics, or greatcoats feature shoulder straps. They were originally designed to keep back packs, ammunition pouches or bayonets from slipping off the shoulder. They often display badges of rank, shoulder marks, regimental insignia or epaulettes. Carrier shoulder strap A carrier shoulder strap on a backpack A carrier shoulder strap is a length of fabric or other flexible material (such as leather, vinyl, rubber), used to suspend an item, often of some weight, from the shoulder(s). The strap may be worn slung over one shoulder or across the body. In the interest of comfort, they often have some manner of padding near the middle, where the strap rests directly against the shoulder or neck. Such items include purses, guitars, rifles, etc. In the case of rifles and other such weaponry, the shoulder strap is usually referred to as a sling. Shoulder straps may also be used in pairs on such items as a backpack or a baby carrier; the straps are worn one over each shoulder, and the item so carried is centred on the back or chest. Some camera strap manufacturers, such as BlackRapid, design their straps to fit over both shoulders allowing two cameras to rest at hip level. The use of such straps frees the hands for other use.

The General Church of the New Jerusalem distinguishes itself from other Swedenborgian churches by teaching that the Writings for the New Church are the Heavenly Doctrine revealed by the Lord in His Second Coming and have authority equal to the Old and New Testaments. It is larger, newer, and more conservative than the Swedenborgian Church of North America.  Doctrine  The General Church of the New Jerusalem accepts the doctrine of the New Church as described in the works published by Emanuel Swedenborg. The following doctrine can be drawn from and verified by these works. Among these works are, True Christian Religion, Heaven and Hell, Conjugial Love, The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine, Heavenly Secrets, The Doctrine of the Lord, and many more. In these works the doctrine of The New Church is defined. * The Creator of the Universe (YHWH) came into this world, taking on the form of Jesus Christ (God with us) in order to combat the real Hell humanity had created, redeem humankind from Hell's growing and overwhelming influence, permanently restore His connection with humankind, and by His Divinely Human life show people the path to spiritual freedom. **He struggled against every evil that humanity encounters in the corrupted will by allowing the evils of Hell to attack Him on the battleground of His Human form, overcoming evil in every instance, and making His Human form One with His uniquely Divine Soul, even as to the flesh and bones. Jesus Christ, thus, entirely became the One God through a process of removing the natural human imperfections and uniting His Divine Soul with His Human form. **The New Church has been seen as a proponent of Monarchianism; it does not, however, see God as appearing in three modes. God is seen as One Divine Person, Jesus Christ, who has a Divine Soul of Love, Divine Mind of Truth, and Divine Body of Energy. It is believed that unlike Arianism this doctrine retains both the Unity of God, as well as the full Divinity of Christ, and thus that it is not necessary to split God into a Trinity of persons. * Following Him is seen as the only loving and rational choice one can make, since He is the One Source of all love and truth. If one is learning truth or doing good, it is from Him, whether it is consciously known or not. **His direct instruction is found in the Word of the Old and New Testament, and the Word of His Second Coming, written through Emanuel Swedenborg, who was prepared mentally and spiritually by the Lord to receive the Revelation of the Lord's Holy Spirit, which reveals the answers to the mysteries of faith, leads into all truth, and speaks of the Father plainly. * Every one of us can become angels if we choose to stop doing evil actions and allow the Lord's presence to grow within us. All angels in Heaven and Devils in Hell were once people on earth. * The Lord created us all to go to heaven, but He does not make anyone go there. We freely choose our eternal destiny. **People of all faiths come into heaven if they have followed their beliefs sincerely and loved God and their neighbors. A person is seen as responsible for their reaction to the truth when it is made known to them. Those who love evil tend to choose to reject the truth, whereas those who love good choose to receive it openly. **Those who go to Hell have chosen Hell because they enjoy Hellish delights, which in Hell are only allowed to be enjoyed as fantasy. * The spiritual marriage of one man and woman does not end with death but continues in heaven to eternity. There, the two remain male and female as to form, and become one angel as to their soul. As a couple they live a life of useful service in the Lord's Heavenly Kingdom, which is perfected to eternity. * This earth and all of nature is part of the Lord's Kingdom, and in nature we can see the Love and Wisdom of the Lord manifested, but not apart from written revelation. *Much of the Bible is believed to have not only a literal sense, but a spiritual sense as well, which work together by means of correspondence (theology). In other words, the Bible is seen as a kind of spiritual allegory, which uses words as symbols that each point to a particular spiritual form or concept. On the deepest level the Bible is seen as a story of the Lord's internal life as it was when He was on earth. * Members of the New Church believe the One God, Jesus Christ is the author of the Word of the Second Coming, not Swedenborg. Swedenborg was merely an instrument of the Lord, as he himself stated. **The New Church is not seen as a denomination of traditional Christianity, but rather, the True Christianity, which the Lord has come to establish by means of His Holy Spirit, which leads into all truth. History In 1890, as a result of a doctrinal disagreement, the General Church broke away from the General Convention of the Church of the New Jerusalem, also known as the Swedenborgian Church of North America, which had itself been established in 1817.http://www.heavenlydoctrines.org/Books%20and%20Monographs%5CKramph%20Will%20Case.html at pp. 22-27. In 1999, the General Church had about 5,600 members, and the General Convention had about 2,600 members.

This part of Calhoun County later became Gulf County. The map shows the towns of Apalachicola (in Franklin County) and St. Joseph (in Calhoun County), and the rail lines of the Lake Wimico and St. Joseph Railroad, running from St. Joseph to Lake Wimico (which is unlabeled) and from St. Joseph to the Apalachicola River at Iola, The Lake Wimico and St. Joseph Canal and Railroad was the first steam railroad in Florida and one of the first in the U.S., opening in 1836. With the collapse of the town of St. Joseph, the railroad was abandoned by 1842. The Lake Wimico and St. Joseph Canal Company was chartered by Legislative Council of the Territory of Florida in 1835, and was renamed in 1836 to the Lake Wimico and St. Joseph Canal and Railroad Company. Disputed land ownership had caused many residents of Apalachicola, the port at the mouth of the Apalachicola River, to start the new town of St. Joseph on St. Joseph Bay. The original plan was to dig a canal from the Apalachicola River to St. Joseph to allow steamboats to connect directly with ocean-going ships. Before excavation on the canal began, the company decided to instead build a railroad. Construction of the roadbed began in October, 1835, before the company's charter was modified to allow it to build a railroad. An long rail line to Columbus Bayou (renamed Depot Creek) on Lake Wimico was completed in March, 1836. Horses and mules hauled the first trains, but two steam locomotives were delivered later in the year, and became the first steam power used on a railroad in Florida.Gregg 2008: 38‚Äì40 Lake Wimico was connected to the Apalachicola River by the Jackson River. The success of the railroad was limited by difficulties steamboats faced in reaching the docks at Depot Creek. The Jackson River had many hazards to navigation, and Lake Wimico was often too shallow when water levels were low. To provide a better connection for the steamboats, a new rail line was built from St. Joseph to a point on the Apalachicola River near present-day Wewahitchka, from St. Joseph. Construction on the new line began in 1837, and was completed in October, 1839. The town of Iola was founded at the terminus of the railroad. Besides the railroad terminal and a couple of warehouses, Iola had a steam sawmill, a gristmill, a post office, and a hotel. A yellow fever epidemic devastated St.Joseph in 1841, drastically reducing the population and commerce of the city. A hurricane later that year destroyed the railroad's wharf at St. Joseph. The railroad went bankrupt and its movable equipment was auctioned off in 1842. Both St. Joseph and Iola were abandoned.Gregg 2008: 40‚Äì42 The railroad was constructed with a track gauge, using wood rails with strap iron on top. The rail line extended onto a wharf in St.Joseph Bay, and onto docks at Depot Creek and Iola, to permit direct transfer of cargo between rail cars and shipping.Gregg 2003: 13 The West Florida and Alabama Railroad, incorporated in 1883, attempted to revive the roadbed, but it failed. In the 1920s the portion of the roadbed between Wewahitchka and White City in Gulf County became part of the Beeline Highway, a national auto trail, and now part of State Road 71. In 1910, the Apalachicola Northern Railroad used part of the old Lake Wimico and St. Joseph roadbed for a branch line to Port St.Joe.Gregg 2003: 15 Notes References * * Category:Defunct Florida railroads Category:Railway companies established in 1835 Category:Railway companies disestablished in 1842 Category:5 ft gauge railways in the United States Category:American companies established in 1835 Category:1835 establishments in Florida Territory Category:American companies disestablished in 1842 ","title":"Lake Wimico and St. Joseph Canal and Railroad Company"},{"id":"2081093","text":"St. Joseph was a boomtown that briefly became the largest community in Florida, United States, before being abandoned less than eight years after it was founded. St. Joseph was founded in 1835 on the shores of St. Joseph Bay. A brief period of prosperity was ended by a yellow fever epidemic in 1841, and the abandoned remnants of the town were destroyed by a storm surge in 1844. The town site is in Gulf County, Florida, near the city of Port St. Joe. Background The creation of St. Joseph grew out of a land dispute in Apalachicola, Florida. Early in the 19th century John Forbes and Company, a Scottish-owned trading company authorized by the Spanish government of Florida to trade with Indians, had pressured Creeks and Seminoles to settle their debts with the company by transferring title to large tracts of land in Florida. The transfers were confirmed as grants by the Spanish government. The biggest block of land, amounting to between the St. Marks and Apalachicola Rivers, became known as the Forbes Purchase, or Forbes Grant. The partners of John Forbes and Company sold most of the Forbes Purchase to what later became the Apalachicola Land Company before the transfer of Florida from Spain to the United States in 1821. Establishment of the legitimacy of Spanish land grants in Florida made in the final years before the transfer of Florida required validation in United States courts. By the time that ownership of the Forbes Purchase by the Apalachicola Land Company had been confirmed in court in 1835, the town of Apalachicola had grown up on the west side of the mouth of the Apalachicola River. The land company offered to sell title to the occupied lots in town, but at prices that drove many residents to abandon their homes and move west to the shores of St. Joseph Bay. Growth and prosperity Map of Calhoun County, Florida in 1842 showing the county seat of St. Joseph, Apalachicola (in Franklin County), and the rail lines of the Lake Wimico and St. Joseph Railroad, running from St. Joseph to Lake Wimico (which is unlabeled) and from St. Joseph to the Apalachicola River at Iola St. Joseph Bay is a good natural harbor, while large ships had to anchor from Apalachicola, with cargo being transferred by barge between ships and the shore. On the other hand, St. Joseph Bay has no inflowing streams or rivers, and in 1835, had essentially nothing to ship out. The settlers of St. Joseph intended to divert cargo moving down the Apalachicola River, principally cotton and lumber, to the bay, bypassing Apalachicola. The Lake Wimico and St. Joseph Canal Company was chartered by the Legislative Council of the Territory of Florida in 1835 to dig a canal between St. Joseph and Lake Wimico, which was connected to the Apalachicola River by the Jackson River. Before excavation of the canal began, the company decided to connect Lake Wimico and St. Joseph with a railroad, and work was started on the roadbed. In 1836, the legislative council amended the company's charter (which become the Lake Wimico and St. Joseph Canal and Railroad Company) to allow it to build a railroad from any point on the Apalachicola River to St. Joseph. An long rail line from St. Joseph to Lake Wimico was completed in March, 1836, and the town became a shipping port. By 1837 St. Joseph had become the most populous place in Florida, with an reported population between 4,000 and 12,000 inhabitants. (The 1840 federal census counted 125 heads of household and approximately 750 free whites in St. Joseph.) In 1838 the town hosted the first Constitutional Convention for Florida, which drew up a proposed constitution to be used when Florida became a state. St. Joseph was originally in Franklin County. Calhoun County was created out of Franklin, Jackson and Washington counties in 1838, with St. Joseph serving as the county seat until the collapse of the city. St. Joseph had a mixed reputation. It was regarded as a \\"healthy and pleasant town\\", and many residents of Tallahassee resorted there in the summer. A delegate to the constitutional convention in 1838 wrote: \\"It was a striving busy place, its citizens full of energy and hope, fine buildings and hotels adorned the town and more were building.\\" The same writer extolled the beauty of the bay. On the other hand, the presence of a gambling house, a horse racing track, bars, and the many sailors expected in a busy port, resulted in St. Joseph being called the \\"wickedest City in the Southeast.\\" In 1839 the St. Joseph Bay Light was built and placed in operation on St. Joseph Point, the northern end of the St. Joseph Peninsula, to mark the entrance to St. Joseph Bay. The light remained in service until 1847, when the lighthouse lantern and other equipment were moved to the new Cape San Blas lighthouse. The old St. Joseph Bay lighthouse was washed away in 1851. Decline and abandonment Storms in 1837 and 1839 drove ships ashore and destroyed buildings. In 1841 a ship brought yellow fever to St. Joseph. The disease killed many of the town's inhabitants, and caused most of the rest to flee. Robert R. Reid, fourth governor of the Territory of Florida, and other residents of Tallahassee, died that year of yellow fever that they reportedly contracted while in St. Joseph. Of an estimated 5,000 inhabitants in early 1841, only some 500 remained in St. Joseph after the epidemic ended. A hurricane, \\"The Late Gale at St. Joseph\\", hit the town on September 14, 1841, destroying the wharf, but with the collapse of trade, no ships were in port. A forest fire later that year burned part of the town. In 1843 residents of Apalachicola moved many abandoned houses to Apalachicola. While many houses were dismantled for transportation to Apalachicola, some were placed on barges and floated intact to that city, where a few still exist. On May 1, 1844, the USS General Taylor called at St. Joseph, and found a town largely deserted, with only a few residents preparing to leave, and some workers dismantling houses. Later that year a hurricane struck St. Joseph on September 9 with a large storm surge, destroying whatever remained in the abandoned town. Some who had regarded St. Joseph as a \\"sin city\\" interpreted the storm surge as a manifestation of God's wrath. The area remained sparsely inhabited for the rest of the 19th century. After a branch of the Apalachicola Northern Railroad reached St. Joseph Bay about north of the site of Old St. Joseph in 1910, a new city, Port St. Joe, grew up at the port.  Present day  The only remains of St. Joseph are some tombstones in the Old St. Joseph, or 'Yellow Fever', Cemetery in present-day Port St. Joe - coincidentally located very close to the current office of the county health department. The Constitution Convention Museum State Park nearby explains the role of St. Joseph in the early history of Florida government.

The South Tyrol Option Agreement (; ) was an agreement in effect between 1939 and 1943, when the native German speaking people in South Tyrol and three communes in the province of Belluno were given the option of either emigrating to neighboring Nazi Germany (of which Austria was a part after the 1938 Anschluss) or remaining in Fascist Italy and being forcibly integrated into the mainstream Italian culture, losing their language and cultural heritage. Over 80% opted to move to Germany.  Background  The region of South Tyrol had been a place of contending claims and conflict between German nationalism and Italian nationalism. One of the leading founders of Italian nationalism, Giuseppe Mazzini, along with Ettore Tolomei, counterfactually claimed that the German-speaking South Tyrolian population were in fact mostly a Germanicized population of Roman origin who needed to be \\"liberated and returned to their rightful culture\\".Jens Woelk, Francesco Palermo, Joseph Marko (2008). Tolerance Through Law: Self Governance and Group Rights In South Tyrol. Leiden, Netherlands: Koninlijke Brill NV, p. 5. The southern part of Tyrol, renamed \\"Province of Bolzano\\", had been a part of Italy since the end of World War I. After the rise of fascism in 1922, a policy of Italianization in the area was implemented ruthlessly. All places, down to the tiniest hamlet, were given Italian names, and even family names were translated. The process intensified in the 1930s, when the government of Benito Mussolini encouraged thousands of southern Italians to relocate to the region, in a deliberate attempt at reducing the indigenous German-speaking population to minority status. Between 1928 and 1939 various resistance groups formed in the province to fight the fascist Italian regime and its policy of suppressing the German language. Children were taught the prohibited German language in clandestine catacombe schools and Catholic media and associations resisted the forced integration under the protection of the Vatican. The underground resistance movement, the V√∂lkischer Kampfring S√ºdtirols, was formed by a Nazi party member, Peter Hofer (de).  Option for Germany  On 21 October 1939, Adolf Hitler and Mussolini reached agreement on the assimilation of the ethnic German minorities in the province. The members of these two language communities had to choose until 31 December 1939 between remaining in Italy and losing all minority rights, or emigrating to Nazi Germany, the so-called \\"Option f√ºr Deutschland\\" (option for Germany). 85%-90% of the population opted for emigration; they were called Optanten and banded together in the Arbeitsgemeinschaft der Optanten f√ºr Deutschland (Association of Optants for Germany). Those who chose to stay, called Dableiber, mainly banded together around local Catholic priests. The Dableiber were condemned as traitors while the Optanten were defamed as Nazis. The Option destroyed many families and the development of the economy of the province was set back for many years. The first families left their homeland in 1939, and by 1943 a total of around 75,000 South Tyroleans had emigrated, of which 50,000 returned after the war. The Arbeitsgemeinschaft der Optanten f√ºr Deutschland (ADO) (German for \\"Association of optants for Germany\\") was an association for German-speakers who had chosen to emigrate to Germany rather than stay in South Tyrol. The association was founded on 30 January 1940. Peter Hofer took leadership of the Association.  German occupation  In September 1943, the Wehrmacht occupied the province and on 10 September 1943 the Operation Zone of the Alpine Foothills was established. The ADO was dissolved and joined with the Deutsche Volksgruppe. Peter Hofer was chosen as the Volksgruppenf√ºhrer. Some members of the ADO joined with the South Tyrolean Volunteer Corps and were involved in the annihilation of the Jewish population in Meran. They also attempted to arrest fleeing Italian soldiers and attacked those who had chosen to remain even though it had been expressly forbidden by the Third Reich authority. The relocation of people and the complete Italianization of the area were never fully accomplished.  Aftermath  Most of the people who had emigrated returned to the area in 1945. Despite Austrian efforts, South Tyrol remained part of Italy after World War II, and many chose to take up Italian citizenship after the Gruber‚ÄìDe Gasperi Agreement of September 1946. It was named after the foreign minister of Austria (Karl Gruber) and the prime minister of Italy (Alcide De Gasperi) and agreed on Trentino-Alto Adige/S√ºdtirol to remain part of Italy ensuring its autonomy. Those who returned had to register both themselves and their children, and they had to prove, by means of a birth certificate, that they had the right to Italian citizenship. After 1945, no ADO leaders were tried for the crimes (Peter Hofer was killed during an Allied bombing raid). Only recently have historians started to examine this period in the history of South Tyrol. According to the 2001 census, more than two-thirds (69.4%) of the population of the province speak German, 26.3% Italian and 4.3% Ladin as their mother language.Oscar Benvenuto (ed.): \\"South Tyrol in Figures 2008\\", Provincial Statistics Institute of the Autonomous Province of South Tyrol, Bozen/Bolzano 2007, p. 19, Table 11  See also  *German as a minority language *Italia irredenta  References   Sources  *C.

It is to the southwest of Huddersfield Town Centre, to the west of the River Holme. Lockwood was originally called North Crosland and part of the Crosland family estate. However, it was taken over by the Lockwood family after a series of disputes between the dynasties. Parts of the area are still known as North Crosland.North Crosland Lockwood at geograph.org. Lockwood railway station is on the Penistone Line between Huddersfield and Sheffield. It is situated in Swan Lane, just before the Grade II-listed, 32-arched Lockwood viaduct, which spans the valley and connects the line to Berry Brow. Prior to the mid-1970s it had its own extensive goods yard, coal yard, sidings and station master's house. The goods yards were used to service and supply raw materials to the former engineering works of David Brown Ltd. This particular division of David Brown's produced gearboxes for industrial machinery and hydraulic drives and some military armoured vehicles. The gear box that turns the top of the Post Office Tower in London was designed and built there, whilst the electric motors that drives the gearing were manufactured by Brook (Electric) Motors, based in Brockholes. A branch line from the station, just before the railway viaduct, went via Armitage Bridge and Netherton to Meltham. This passed Meltham Mills, where David Brown Ltd. had a tractor manufacturing facility. The former station master's house is now a private residence and the goods yards are part of a timber merchant's. Lockwood is the manufacturing base of locally renowned Dixon's Milk Ices, housed in the former Lockwood Town Hall. The Huddersfield Rugby Union Football Club, at Lockwood Park, is situated below and to both sides of the railway viaduct, in the former 'Bentley & Shaws' Brewery. Lockwood Brewery Timothy Bentley, founder of 'Bentley & Shaws' Lockwood Brewery, is recognised as the inventor of the Stone Square system of brewing beer.Peter Robinson, 'Samuel Smith: Yorkshire Squares', Brewery History Society Journal. This method allowed high levels of carbon dioxide to remain in the beer during fermentation, helping to give it a unique flavour and smoothness when served. The stone used in the brewery came from stone quarries in Elland. The brewery was taken over by Bass Charrington before it closed down in the late 1960s.

Elevations range from along the Sacramento River near the base of the crags, to over at the summit of the tallest crag. Located just west of Interstate 5, between the towns of Castella and Dunsmuir, Castle Crags is today a popular tourist stop along the highway. Mount Shasta is 10 miles to the north. The formation and surrounding habitats are protected by Castle Crags State Park, located on both sides of Interstate 5 at them, and by Castle Crags Wilderness Area of the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. Geology Seen from Interstate 5 Although the Northern Coast Ranges of northwestern California consist largely of rocks of volcanic and sedimentary origin, granite bodies (plutons) intruded many parts of the area during the Jurassic period. Heavy glaciation at this location during the Pleistocene eroded much of the softer surrounding rock leaving the towering crags and spires exposed, from which the Castle Crags pluton derives its name. Exfoliation of huge, convex slabs of granite yielded rounded forms such as the prominent Castle Dome feature of Castle Crags. History Situated along an ancient trade and travel route known as the Siskiyou Trail, Castle Crags has witnessed dramatic events. Strained relationships between 1850s California Gold Rush miners and the local native Indian populations resulted in the 1855 Battle of Castle Crags, in which the poet Joaquin Miller was wounded, and which he later described in an essay of the same name. Exploitation of the land by lumber and mining operations encouraged concerned citizens in 1933 to acquire much of the land, which would eventually become Castle Crags State Park. However much of the crags themselves are part of the Castle Crags Wilderness Area within the Shasta-Trinity National Forest, managed by the U.S. Forest Service. The forested area of Castle Crags State Park was used by several native groups. The wilderness was the ancestral home to the Okwanuchu Shasta people. The Crags were also revered by the indigenous people surrounding them including the Wintu, Achumawi and Modoc people. Many features of the Castle Crags Wilderness are considered sacred to Native Americans including all of the streams, the Sacramento River, and the region's abundance of natural springs. During the 1848 California Gold Rush, miners flocked to California from all over the world, invading the original homelands and destroying the life- sustaining resources and environments of the native people. Thousands of miners invaded the Castle Crags Wilderness when false rumors of the fabled \\"Lost Cabin Mine\\" began to circulate in the region. This invasion led to the genocide, slavery and forcible displacement of indigenous people. Joaquin Miller wrote about the atrocities committed on the regions native populations during the 1855 Battle of Castle Crags, in one instance describing in detail a massacre of Native American women, children and infants who were ambushed by a mob of drunken settlers while they slept. More than two-thirds of the native California Indian people died as a result of the conquest, with its gruesome violence and contagious diseases‚Äîamong them, many Okwanuchu Shasta, Wintu and Modoc people from this area. Native Americans utilized a natural mineral spring in the Castle Crags Wilderness which is known today as Castle Rock Mineral Spring, and is situated on the edge of the Sacramento River inside of Castle Crags State Park. The mineral spring is supported within a rock-built enclosure which was constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps back in the 1930s. Today it still has a sulfuric smell and bubbles up from the ground. The natural mineral waters are widely reputed to have restorative, healing, medicinal and therapeutic properties. The massacre of indigenous people from the Castle Crags Wilderness opened up the region for commercial and industrial exploitation of the land's resources, which are sacred to native people. The Castle Rock Mineral Spring was one of the earliest land resources seized after a genocidal campaign that eliminated Native Americans from this region. During the 1890s, the Castle Rock Mineral Springs Bottling Works was formed, and cases of the mineral water were bottled, sold and shipped all over the world to prestigious clients. = Castle Rock Water Company = Castle Rock Mineral Springs Bottling Works was founded in 1889 in Dunsmuir, California, United States. The company bottled natural spring water which was shipped all over the world. George Washington Bailey operated a resort and a hotel across the river from the Castle Rock Mineral Springs. A footbridge provided convenient access for tourists from the hotel to the springs. People traveled from all over the nation to visit the resort and mineral springs, which were said to contain healing properties. The company operated profitably until 1906, when the San Francisco earthquake ended its plans to further divide up and develop the area commercially. The company subsequently went bankrupt during the 1929 stock market crash. In 1943 the State of California purchased 925 acres of the Castle Rock Springs property, which was the beginning of Castle Crags State Park. ;Flora A panoramic view of Castle Crags from inside Castle Crags State Park Two native species of plants which are endemic to Castle Crags are: *Castle Crags ivesia (Ivesia longibracteata) *Castle Crags bellflower (Campanula shetleri) See also * Dunsmuir, California * Castle Crags Wilderness References *Aune, Quintin A., 1970, A Trip to Castle Crags: Mineral Information Service, Vol. 23, pp. 139‚Äì144. *Miller, Joaquin 1837-1913.

Fawcett was also an independent newsstand distributor, and in 1949 the company negotiated a contract with New American Library to distribute their Mentor and Signet titles. This contract prohibited Fawcett from publishing their own paperback reprints. Roscoe Kent Fawcett wanted to establish a line of Fawcett paperbacks, and he felt original paperbacks would not be a violation of the contract. In order to test a loophole in the contract, Fawcett published two anthologies ‚Äî The Best of True Magazine and What Today's Woman Should Know About Marriage and Sex ‚Äî reprinting material from Fawcett magazines not previously published in books. When these books successfully sailed through the contract loophole, Fawcett announced Gold Medal Books, their line of paperback originals. Sales soared, prompting Ralph Daigh to comment, \\"In the past six months we have produced 9,020,645 books, and people seem to like them very well.\\" However, hardcover publishers resented Roscoe Fawcett's innovation, as evidenced by Doubleday's LeBaron R.

What Gold Medal specialized in was original novels. Some were merely sleazy, but others were in a tough, hard-boiled style that seemed somehow more knowing and more contemporary than that of the surviving pulps.\\" Early Gold Medal authors included John D. MacDonald, Charles Williams, Richard S. Prather, and Marijane Meaker (under the pseudonym of \\"Vin Packer\\"). Other 1950 Gold Medal originals included the Western Stretch Dawson by William R.

With an increase from 35 titles in 1950 to 66 titles in 1951, Gold Medal's obvious success in issuing paperback originals revolutionized the industry. While MacDonald, Williams, Prather, Louis L'Amour, Richard Matheson, Bruno Fischer, and MacKinlay Kantor were joining Gold Medal's roster of writers, other paperback publishers were soon asking agents for original manuscripts.

American psychologist Gordon Allport first used this term in his 1954 book, The Nature of Prejudice,Allport, Gordon W (1955). The Nature of Prejudice. Cambridge, US to label the first of the five degrees of antipathy that measure manifestation of prejudice in a society as antilocution (see also: \\"Allport's Scale\\"). Antilocution is similar to the rather common form of betrayal in which a person \\"talks behind someone's back.\\", but antilocution involves an in-group ostracizing an out-group on a biased basis. The use of the term antilocution is overshadowed by the term hate speech, which holds a similar meaning but places no regard on the fact that the out-group is unaware of the discrimination. Etymology The term antilocution first appeared in 1954 in \\"The Nature of Prejudice\\", a book written by an American psychologist \\"Gordon Allport\\". Antilocution is the first stage of Allport's scale, a scale to measure the degree of bias or prejudice in one's society. Following antilocution, the greater stages of prejudice are avoidance, discrimination, physical attack, and extermination respectively. Antilocution is a compound noun which consists of the word locution and the word anti, to express a counterproductive way to employ locution. Description Antilocution is considered the least aggressive form of prejudice and represented by conversations of individuals in a society sharing similar opinions, which often are biased and result in negative reputation of the target of antilocution. Although this form of prejudice maybe the least aggressive, it nevertheless can be very destructive and life-changing for the subject. Those who employ antilocution may not be aware or consider themselves as involved in any discriminatory act. Antilocution is perhaps the most common form of discriminative act, and is more commonly referred as minor gossips or scandals. The subject may feel the need to join in with the flow or comedize it if the antilocution is employed by the majority. This can either create a place for the subject in the pack or lead to a spread of biased information through the society and can lead to negative modification in behaviors toward the subject, thus will significantly put the subject in a disadvantaged way both socially and mentally. Causes, employment, and danger Individuals often engage in prejudicial conversation when they feel threatened and frequently is based on misperceptions and stereotyping of the subject. Antilocution often related to the fact that the subject is viewed as an anomaly to the group, for example the subject maybe a newcoming member thus no one actually know the subject so they judge the subject based on their perceptions and stereotyping, often involve racism, ethnic, or gender. Most individuals engaged in this type of behavior will most likely deny that their behavior is prejudicial in any way, and often indicate this as a matter of expressing their own opinions. This kind of treatment to antilocution is very dangerous in its own as it leads to a widespread in discriminative acts toward the subject as individuals feel little to no guilt in doing so. Facts are often needed to contradict misinformation and create a positive influence in the society toward the subject, or else opinions will continue to multiply and lead to further misconceptions, which can eventually lead to more serious forms of prejudice and discrimination and will harm the subject socially, mentally, and even physically if the problem worsen to a certain degree.

Based on the sport of demolition derby, the game tasks the player with racing and destroying cars to score points. The developers implemented simulated physics to make the results of collisions easier to predict, and they kept the game's tracks small to increase the number of wrecks. Versions of Destruction Derby were released for MS-DOS, PlayStation and Sega Saturn. A Nintendo 64 version, Destruction Derby 64, was released in 1999 by Looking Glass Studios and THQ. Critics found Destruction Derby enjoyable and they praised its graphics and car damage system, but the Nintendo 64 and Sega Saturn releases received mixed reviews. It does not work fully on all PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 models due to game save file issues. The game started the Destruction Derby franchise, beginning with its 1996 sequel, Destruction Derby 2. Gameplay The player engages in a Destruction Derby contest at The Bowl. Destruction Derby is a vehicular combat racing video game based on the sport of demolition derby. The game contains three vehicles. Collisions in the game affect the controls of each car, limiting their steering and maximum speed. Frontal collisions risk damage to the car's radiator, which causes the car to overheat and stop running. Four game modes are available: Destruction Derby, Wreckin' Racing, Stock Car Racing and Time Trial. In Destruction Derby, the player earns points by destroying other cars in a large, trackless arena called The Bowl; in Stock Car Racing, the player must finish in first place, and no points are awarded for destroying cars. Wreckin' Racing is a hybrid of the two, in which the player earns points both by winning the race and by destroying other cars. Time Trial is a solo time attack mode. The PlayStation version features system link play for two players, while the MS-DOS version has an online multiplayer mode. Destruction Derby 64, the game's Nintendo 64 version, features updated graphics and an increased number of cars and tracks; and it adds new modes such as capture the flag. The game contains twenty-four cars and more than twelve courses. It also supports split-screen multiplayer for up to four players. Development The British development studio Reflections Interactive began creating Destruction Derby for the PlayStation in late 1994. It was published by Sony Computer Entertainment's Psygnosis branch, which allowed Reflections to receive PlayStation development kits long before that console's release. The game debuted at the May 1995 Electronic Entertainment Expo, and its initial title was variously reported as Demolition Derby and Demolish 'em Derby. Writers for Edge and Next Generation commented that the game could \\"trounce\\" Ridge Racer upon the PlayStation's release. To make the results of car collisions easier to predict, Reflections implemented simulated physics into Destruction Derby. Director Martin Edmondson believed that the game would otherwise be \\"completely unplayable\\", as with \\"pool when the collisions are all off\\". Producer Tony Parks noted that the physics were simplified to improve performance and to compensate for the PlayStation's digital controller, and that the team sought a balance between \\"realism and playability\\". Performance was also improved by optimising the game's graphics, and by reducing the level of detail of objects in the distance. Destruction Derbys game engine supports up to twenty cars on screen simultaneously, which no console racing game, other than Daytona USA, had achieved until that time. However, a single wire-frame model, differentiated by texture maps, was used for every vehicle. Damage to vehicles is modelled in real-time, based on the speed and angle of the cars involved. The team made the game's tracks small to \\"keep the density of the cars on the track very high\\", which allowed for large-scale wrecks. Plans were made to support up to eight players with the PlayStation Link Cable. Destruction Derby was published by Sega and developed by Perfect Entertainment for the Sega Saturn, as part of a deal that also brought Wipeout to the console. This version lacks transparencies. GameFans Ryan Lockhart estimated that the port was \\"80% ready\\" in the magazine's August 1996 issue, and it was released in August 1996. SoftBank planned to release the Sega Saturn version of the game in the US, along with Wipeout, Krazy Ivan, and Assault Rigs, however only Wipeout was released. A Nintendo 64 version of Destruction Derby was announced by the UK magazine CTW in 1998, alongside Nintendo 64 versions of Psygnosis games such as Wipeout and O.D.T.. Destruction Derby 64 was developed by Looking Glass Studios and published by THQ, under license from Psygnosis. At the time, Looking Glass head Paul Neurath said in a press release, \\"We are delighted to have teamed up with THQ for the launch of Destruction Derby 64\\". Aaron Boulding of IGN commented that the game \\"had a tough time just making it to the N64\\" during its 18 months in production, and noted that \\"development duties [...] passed from Psygnosis to Looking Glass Studios and publishing [was] picked up by THQ.\\" The game was released in October 1999. Reception Writing for GamePro, Captain Squideo called Destruction Derby \\"the most raucous racing experience of the fall\\". He believed that its \\"graphics are almost all you could want for a game\\" of this type, but wrote that \\"nothing here stands out as graphically spectacular\\". He complained that the game does not let players customise cars, and he disliked its lack of split-screen multiplayer. He summarised, \\"Limited options keep Destruction Derby out of the winner's circuit, but this rowdy stock-car racer still generates a stadium full of thrashin' fun.\\" Victor Lucas of The Electric Playground stated that \\"the beauty of the game\\" is the strategy involved in making \\"calculated strikes\\" against enemy vehicles, and he wrote, \\"If you go all out and try to make big noise on the track, more than likely you'll be limping to the scrap yard in seconds.\\" He believed that the game's Stock Car racing mode \\"is no match for the white knuckle inertia of either Wipeout or Ridge Racer\\", and that the demolition derbies in The Bowl were \\"most fun to be had\\" in the game. He praised the game's graphics and physics, and concluded, \\"Destruction Derby is a winner in every capacity.\\" A reviewer for Next Generation was extremely pleased with the concept of smashing into other cars, saying it taps into a near-universal fantasy. He remarked the single-player mode is indefinably \\"lacking\\" but the multiplayer offers unqualified enjoyment. The PC port was also well-received. Lee Buchanan of PC Gamer US praised \\"the spectacular visuals that bring to life the most jarring collisions I've seen on a computer\\", and he noted that \\"[car] damage is depicted beautifully\\". Like Lucas, he wrote that the player \\"can't just mindlessly smash into other cars; this is thinking man's destruction\\". Although he found the game too easy \\"even at the toughest difficulty level\\", he found this to be a minor issue that did not detract from the experience. He considered the game's online play to be a high point, and he finished, \\"Destruction Derby is a blast, and a welcome change of pace from high-end driving simulations.\\" Peter Olafson of Computer Gaming World called the game \\"a great simulation\\" of demolition derbies, and he wrote that the wrecks are \\"convulsive and realistic\\". He believed that the game \\"has never-before-seen quality that will instantly make it a showpiece game to demonstrate to open- mouthed friends and relatives\\", and he considered the car damage to be \\"especially marvelous‚Äîand unprecedented for this sort of game\\". However, he found that its \\"useful life span is surprisingly short\\" and he hoped for a track editor in its sequel. He summarised, \\"Despite its limitations, this is a great game, but it has a lot more potential.\\" A reviewer for Next Generation remarked that while the game is a straight port of the PlayStation version, it is an impeccably accurate one. He applauded the authentic modelling of vehicle crashes, multiple modes, smoothness of gameplay, and inclusion of both network and modem options, and found the game's only downside is that the camera zooms out so little that it can be difficult to see nearby cars. Reviewing the game's Sega Saturn version, Kim Randell of Computer & Video Games noted its \\"inferior graphics\\" that do not have \\"the sheen and glossiness of its PlayStation counterpart\\". Randell believed that it was made \\"much too late to cause the kind of sensation that WipEout did. Comparisons with the PlayStation version are inevitable, and the rather haphazard conversion means that the Saturn version lacks the polish of its rival.\\" Rob Allsetter's review in Sega Saturn Magazine (from the same publisher as Computer & Video Games) recycled most of the text from Randell's review, including the closing remarks. Erik Reppen of Game Informer wrote that it \\"doesn't seem fair to compare\\" the Nintendo 64 release to the PlayStation version, and he complained that car damage does not hinder performance. He said that it would more accurately be described as \\"Destruction Derby Arcade\\". He found that the game was far too easy for \\"experienced racers and big fans of the franchise\\" to enjoy, and finished, \\"It was fun, but I wouldn't buy it.\\" Aaron Boulding of IGN believed that Destruction Derby 64 came too long after the original version, and that it was \\"a shadow of the outdated PSX game\\". He complained about the \\"bland backgrounds and flat textures\\" and noted that the graphics are \\"grainy\\" and suffer from slowdown; but he enjoyed the car damage visuals. Boulding liked the split-screen multiplayer and called the new capture the flag mode the game's best aspect, but he concluded that \\"even [these elements] may not make it worth a rental\\". GameFan's Levi Buchanan praised Destruction Derby 64 as \\"the best racer for the Nintendo 64 this year\\", and he lauded its \\"simplistic control\\" as a remedy for the complex controls that he believed had \\"ruined the PlayStation versions\\". He liked its graphics but wrote that its music \\"isn‚Äôt too hot\\". Buchanan enjoyed its multiplayer component and wrote that \\"the slowdown when all four join in is minima[l]‚Äînice programming on the part of Looking Glass\\". Although he complained that the game's vehicle damage is not \\"segmented throughout your car\\", he concluded by calling the game \\"pure, unadulterated fun [that] has enough tracks and hidden vehicles to keep you playing for a very long time\\". Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot wrote, \\"Graphically, Destruction Derby 64 surpasses the old PlayStation games by quite a bit - not that that is a particularly hard thing to do\\". He found that its framerate was adequate even in split-screen mode, and concluded that it was \\"a better game than its PlayStation counterparts\\". He finished, \\"Give it a rent next time you're rounding up the posse for a day of gaming.\\" Destruction Derby spawned the Destruction Derby series, and was directly followed by Destruction Derby 2 in 1996. Later entries include Destruction Derby Raw (2000) and Destruction Derby: Arenas (2004), the last of which was developed by Studio 33. Destruction Derby was re-released through the PlayStation Network store in 2007. The game was included on the PlayStation Classic.

It broadcasts on 102.2 MHz FM. The station is licensed to target the 35+ age group, and must provide hourly news, as well as current events programming. The station was launched as Lite 102.2. On purchasing the station, UTV rebranded it to Dublin's Q102 thanks to research of Dublin people aged over 35, who decided on bringing back the name of a former pirate radio station. Relaunch The station's relaunch was orchestrated by former Big Brother UK contestant Ray Shah, who took over the station until it was relaunched. The take over involved a defacement of Lite 102.2's website and the constant playing of \\"Mah N√† Mah N√†\\" during the transition period. The station's Radio Data System PS name was changed to MUPPET during this time, before settling on Q102 afterwards. The first song played on the new Dublin's Q102 was \\"Night Fever\\" by The Bee Gees followed by \\"What About Me\\" by Shannon Noll. Programming The station broadcasts mainly adult contemporary music aimed at the 35+ age group. The station broadcasts news on the hour (half-hour at peak times) along with sports, traffic and weather updates. Presenters and Management 1\\\\.

Champion-Killer, a legendary saga from Iceland, first attested in the manuscript Stockholm, Royal Library, Holm. 7, 4to, from the first half of the fourteenth century.Ciklamini, M., ‚ÄòThe Combat Between Two Half-Brothers; A Literary Study of the Motif in √Åsmundar saga kappabana and Saxonis gesta Danorum‚Äô, Neophilologus, 50 (1966), 269‚Äì279, 370‚Äì79 DOI 10.1007/BF01515206, 10.1007/BF01515217. It is essentially an adaptation of the German Hildebrandslied, but it has assimilated matter from the Tyrfing Cycle. Synopsis The saga relates that Hildebrand, the king of the Huns had a son named Helgi, who was married to Hild, the daughter of the Swedish king Budli. Helgi and Hild had a son who was raised by his grandfather and named Hildebrand after him. Hildebrand became a great warrior and was called the Hunnish champion. When his father Helgi had fallen in a war, his maternal grandfather, the Swedish king Budli, was killed by a Danish king by the name Alf. This Alf took Hildebrand's mother Hild captive and gave her to the champion Aki with whom she had the son Asmund. When Hildebrand learnt of his father's death, he went to Denmark and slew Aki. However, Alf had a daughter to whom Asmund proposed for marriage. The princess promised to marry Asmund, if he avenged her father and killed Hildebrand. In order to slay Hildebrand, Asmund went to Saxony, which was plagued by Hildebrand and his berserkers. During a series of holmgangs which took several days, Asmund defeated all Hildebrand's warriors. When Hildebrand heard of this, berserker- rage came over him and in his rage he killed his own son. Then he went up the Rhine to meet Asmund and when they met they started to fight. They fought well for a long time, until Hildebrand was severely wounded and his sword broke. Then Hildebrand sang to Asmund that they were half-brothers and asked him to be buried in his clothes. In Gesta Danorum 7:IX.2-X.1, Saxo Grammaticus tells an essentially identical saga, but all the names have been changed and Hildebrand is called Hildiger.

G. Wells' 1898 novel The War of the Worlds whilst protecting a refugee rescue fleet of civilian vessels. Historical basis Torpedo rams were constructed in the 1870s and 1880s after the ramming and sinking of the Re d'Italia at the Battle of Lissa in 1866 by the Austrian flagship, Ferdinand Max. Despite the Italian warship being stationary at the time, the successful attack influenced naval thinking for the next few decades. The result was specially designed low profile, fast, armoured vessels equipped with a ram or torpedoes, or both, intended for use where it was possible to approach an enemy ship without being sunk; for example, at night or in poor visibility, or where the enemy ship was stationary or disabled, or lacked support by nearby ships. As late as 1896, the United States commissioned a ship whose only effective weapon was a ram: the harbour-defence ram USS Katahdin. The Royal Navy's only example was HMS Polyphemus, which entered service in 1882. Its primary armament was torpedoes, with four side-firing tubes and one forward-firing tube in the centre of the bow-mounted ram, like the eye of a Cyclops, hence the ship's name of Polyphemus. The ram was fitted in case the then novel underwater torpedo tubes failed to operate properly. After the ship successfully destroyed a harbour defence boom with her ram in 1885, the Royal Navy ordered two further ships of this class; but neither ship was built, probably because the deployment of quick-firing traversing guns made these vessels vulnerable. Fictional description In the novel Wells gives only a rough description of the ship, describing her thus: \\"About a couple of miles out lay an ironclad, very low in the water, almost, to my brother's perception, like a water-logged ship. This was the ram Thunder Child.\\" A few paragraphs later, it is said that \\"It was the torpedo ram, Thunder Child, steaming headlong, coming to the rescue of the threatened shipping\\". In Jeff Wayne's musical adaptation, the ship is described as an ironclad but not specifically a ram or a torpedo ram; the album cover art illustration of Thunder Child is of a pre-dreadnought battleship such as the Canopus-class in combat with a Martian tripod. The ship is also depicted in art in the Classics Illustrated comic book adaptation of the novel, also appearing as a typical pre-dreadnought battleship of the era. The real torpedo ram HMS Polyphemus was fast, heavily armoured for her size, and capable of operating in shallow coastal waters; her hull was low in the water with a raft-like superstructure mounting six 1-inch Nordenfelt guns, again very much unlike a pre-dreadnought battleship. =Battle= A Henrique Alvim Corr√™a illustration from a 1906 edition of the book. In Wells' original novel the battle takes place off the mouth of the River Blackwater, Essex, where people from London are escaping the Martian offensive. Three Martian fighting-machines having approached the vessels from the seaward side, HMS Thunder Child signals to the main fleet and steams at full speed towards the Martians without firing. The Martians, whom the narrator suggests are unfamiliar with large warships, at first use only a gas attack, which fails, and thereafter using their Heat-Ray, inflicting a great amount of damage upon Thunder Child, which brings down a fighting machine with its guns even as it succumbs to Heat-Ray. The flaming wreckage of the torpedo-ram crashes into a second fighting-machine, destroying it, and when the black smoke and superheated steam banks dissipate, both the Thunder Child and the third fighting-machine are gone. =Aftermath= The attack by Thunder Child occupies the Martians long enough for three Royal Navy ironclads of the main Channel Fleet to arrive. The fate of the third Martian fighting machine is not revealed by Wells, but the battle is shown to have enabled the civilian shipping to escape. Adaptations HMS Thunder Child is commonly omitted from adaptations or replaced with technology more appropriate to the updated setting. In Orson Welles's famous 1938 radio adaptation of The War of the Worlds, a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress heavy bomber replaces the Thunder Child; it collides with a fighting-machine after being critically damaged by its Heat-Ray. In the George Pal 1953 film the last-ditch defence against the Martians is an atomic bomb dropped by a Northrop YB-49 Flying Wing bomber; the weapon proves useless because of each fighting-machine's protective force fields. The first adaptation to feature Thunder Child itself was Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds, which was released in 1978 and retains the Victorian setting of the novel. The album features a song, entitled \\"Thunder Child\\", dedicated to this scene. The cover art of the album depicts a Canopus-class battleship in combat with a Martian tripod. This version of Thunder Child appears to be based on an artist's impression of the Battle of Coronel (1 November 1914), in which the two outdated British armoured cruisers, Good Hope and Monmouth, were sunk with all hands off the coast of Chile by a German fleet of five somewhat more modern cruisers commanded by Vizeadmiral Maximilian von Spee. The 1999 video game, Jeff Wayne's The War of the Worlds, features a level revolving around the Thunder Child. The player is placed in control of the ironclad itself and must sail it down a river while using its cannons to destroy Martian units and settlements; the level ends in a climactic confrontation with the Tempest, a powerful Martian war machine. The only version to feature Thunder Child directly is the low-budget, direct-to-DVD Pendragon adaptation, released in 2005. This version uses poorly executed CGI to portray Thunder Child as a Havock-class destroyer. In Steven Spielberg's 2005 film adaptation, War of the Worlds, contemporary American military forces use tanks and helicopters against the alien Tripods, again without success. Earlier in the film, civilian ferries trying to escape from the Tripods are trapped and easily sunk, with no intervention by a military warship. In the BBC's 2019 TV miniseries, the main characters join up again on the Essex coast, where many small boats are collecting civilians to take them to the ships. A Martian tripod appears and several warships open fire with their cannons against the tripod. Most of these ships are quite a distance from shore, but one of them, which could be the Thunder Child is much closer to shore. The tripod is hit on one of the legs and in the cabin, and shot down. A second Martian tripod appears on the beach, chasing the protagonists, but before it can use its heat-beam, it is hit and destroyed by the guns of the nearest warship. The tripod falls forward narrowly missing crushing the protagonists. As in the original novel the refugees manage to escape although none of the warships are shown being sunk. =Further uses= In the comic book, Scarlet Traces, a sequel set a decade after the events of the novel, the ship (spelled erroneously as Thunderchild) and its efforts are remembered. One of the supporting characters is a survivor of the ship's destruction, presumably the only one who did so; there is also a monument dedicated to the ship's fight against the Martians. In Sherlock Holmes's War of the Worlds the first mate of Thunder Child is said to have been the husband of Violet Hunter, a character from the Sherlock Holmes story The Adventure of the Copper Beeches. In the fictional universe of Star Trek a Federation Akira- class starship is named USS Thunderchild in honour of Wells' fictional ship, and fights against the Borg in Star Trek: First Contact. Due to fan recognition, a physical model of the Akira-class USS Thunderchild was announced for release in an issue of the Eaglemoss collection Star Trek: The Starship Collection. In the computer game, MechWarrior 4: Vengeance, the player faces a pair of destroyers during a mission, one of which is named Thunderchild. In the novel StarCraft: Liberty's Crusade, one of the fleeing starships from the Zerg invasion is named Thunder Child. In the science fiction role-playing game, Traveller: the New Era (TNE), a Reformation Coalition \\"clipper\\"-class starship was named RCS Thunderchild in honour of the War of the Worlds vessel. The ship's patch, presented in the TNE sourcebook Star Vikings, shows the influence of the Jeff Wayne image of the ironclad, combined with a 19th-century image of the Martian war machine. Details also appear in the TNE products Path of Tears and Reformation Coalition Equipment Guide. A novel by Nick Pope, concerning the UK's response to UFOs, is named Operation: Thunder Child. The self-published pastiche novel, The Last Days of Thunder Child by C.A. Powell, is set in 1898 and features the eponymous vessel.

Previously he had been a member of The Housemartins. Hemingway was born in Hull, East Riding of Yorkshire, to Harry Hemingway, a lorry driver and local comedian on the club circuit, and Flo Hemingway, who was one of Hull's best-known barmaids. In Hull's Henry Cooper School, Hemingway was in the same class as The Housemartins' future drummer, Hugh Whitaker. The two shared an interest in drumming, and one day, when the class were asked who would like to learn drums, they put their hands up first. Hemingway followed Whitaker into bands, first the Newpolitans with Dave Rotheray on bass, and then the Velvetones. Whilst at university in London Dave was drummer and a founding member of The Shoppers. It became a well regarded post-punk band (Steve Brain guitar/ lead vocals Maxine Tarte keyboards/ vocals Gavin Hearne lead guitar/vocals Christos Yanni bass/ vocals). His break came when he got a call from Rotheray telling him Whitaker had left The Housemartins. Rotheray recommended him to Housemartins guitarist Stan Cullimore, who phoned him. He was working as a purchase ledger clerk at the time for the Crystal Motor Group. Hemingway quit his job on 6 March 1987, and soon found himself in the studio, recording the band's second album, The People Who Grinned Themselves to Death. After the Housemartins disbanded, he and Housemartins founder Paul Heaton put together The Beautiful South from its ashes, featuring roadie and bassist Sean Welch. Hemingway's first solo album, Hello Cruel World, was released as a download only on iTunes. The album's title was inspired by Hemingway's experience recording in the capital. After forming \\"The South\\" in 2008, Hemingway along with Alison Wheeler from the Beautiful South line-up, released their first album since 2006 entitled Sweet Refrains. The album, featuring songs written by keyboardist Damon Butcher and guitarist Phil Barton, was recorded and released in 2012.

It was intended to include two identical reactors, as well as the isotope-processing facilities necessary to produce a large portion of the world's medical isotopes, especially molybdenum-99, medical cobalt-60, xenon-133, iodine-131 and iodine-125.How the MAPLE Reactors Work An operational license for the MAPLE 1 reactor was granted in 1999, and the reactor went critical for the first time soon after. However, problems with the reactor, most notably a positive power co-efficient of reactivity, led to the cancellation of the project in 2008. History =Background= With the completion of the NRX reactor in 1947, AECL's Chalk River Laboratories possessed the world's most powerful research reactor. While the large neutron fluxes available in the reactor led to advances in such fields as condensed matter physics and neutron spectroscopy, many experiments were carried out involving the production of new isotopes. The field of nuclear medicine developed when it was realized that some of these artificially created isotopes could be used to diagnose and treat many diseases, especially cancers. Pioneering medical work done in the late 1940s and early 1950s established cobalt-60 as a useful isotope, as the relatively high-energy gamma rays produced when it undergoes beta decay are able to penetrate the skin of the patient, and deliver a greater portion of the dose directly to the tumor. The high neutron efficiency of the NRX's heavy water-moderated design, coupled with the high neutron flux of the reactor, made it relatively inexpensive for AECL to produce medical-grade cobalt-60. For example, the cost of the entire unit used to perform the first cobalt-60 treatment was about $50,000. By way of contrast, it would cost $50,000,000 just to produce enough radium (which had been previously used as a therapy source) to perform the same procedure. With this promising start, AECL came to be a major world supplier of medical isotopes, using both the NRX reactor, and the NRU reactor, which came on-line in 1957. However, as these reactors began to age, it became clear that a new facility would be needed to continue the production of medical isotopes. =Beginnings= In the late 1980s, AECL began to acknowledge that continued isotope production would require the construction of a new reactor to replace capacity lost by the planned closing of the NRX in 1992, and the planned closing of the NRU early in the new millennium. Design work on a replacement, originally under the name \\"Maple-X10\\", began in the late 1980s. As part of a restructuring taking place around the same time, the medical isotopes side of AECL was reorganized as Nordion in 1988. Work on the X10 project essentially ended at this point. Nordion company was purchased by MDS in 1991, and an agreement was reached between AECL and MDS Nordion that a new facility dedicated to the production of medical isotopes would be needed. A formal agreement was signed to begin the project in August 1996. Following a year- long environmental assessment, construction began in December 1997.http://anes.fiu.edu/Pro/s4ma1.pdf The design that resulted involved a facility with two identical reactors, each capable of supplying 100% of the world's medical isotope demand. The second reactor would function primarily as a back-up, to ensure that the supply of isotopes would not be interrupted by maintenance or unplanned shutdowns. This is made necessary by the nature of medical isotopes; many have short half-lives, and must be used within a few days of production. With treatments being constantly carried out around the globe, an uninterruptible supply was essential. There has been some local opposition to the use of highly enriched uranium (HEU) in the reactor,Website of local group opposed to HEU in MAPLE as well as from activists in the United States who fear that the uranium could be stolen by terrorists and used to fabricate a bomb.2/19/99 Letter from American group concerned about HEU use in MAPLE =Current status= Originally planned to complete construction in 1999 and 2000, both reactors were instead completed in May 2000. An operational license was granted in August 1999 for the MAPLE I reactor, and extended to include the MAPLE II reactor in June 2000. Commissioning testing was begun immediately, with the MAPLE I achieving its first sustained reaction in February 2000, and MAPLE II following in October 2003. However, during testing, it was noted that some of the emergency shut-off rods in the MAPLE I reactor could fail to deploy in certain demanding situations. This failure was ascribed to workmanship and design issues, and related to fine metal particles accumulating in the control rods' housing and interfering with their free movement. In addition, later testing found that the reactors have a positive power co-efficient of reactivity (PCR), which was in disagreement with the prediction of the modelling, and was a significant barrier to commissioning. A positive power co-efficient means that the reactor becomes more reactive when it heats up; in the case of an unplanned power spike, such a design can \\"run away\\" and potentially cause a meltdown. Consequently, significant efforts were made to resolve the outstanding issues, but progress towards commissioning the reactors was markedly slowed.Press release of an agreement with INVAP for numerical modelling work Index of AECL submissions to the CNSC for licensing, and the subsequent decisions. During the subsequent eight-year-long delay in the start of commercial production, the project significantly overran its budgeted cost. The original budget was $140 million, but by 2005 it had already cost $300 million. Disputes over responsibility for the overruns between AECL and MDS Nordion added a further layer of complexity to the process. After considerable negotiation, AECL assumed full responsibility for the reactor in a settlement.PR Newswire report of AELC-MDS Nordion Settlement (in brief) The MAPLE facility was granted an extension on its operating license on 25 October 2007, which would permit operations until 31 October 2011.Release confirming licence extension. This (final) submission envisioned that the MAPLE 1 reactor would be operational in late 2008.October 2007 AECL submission to the CNSC, see Slide 8 on Page 4. However, on 16 May 2008, AECL released a statement announcing that the MAPLE program had been terminated, as it had become \\"no longer feasible to complete the commissioning and start-up of the reactors\\". In this statement, AECL indicated that they would move to further extend the licence of the operating NRU reactor to continue the production of medical isotopes. The statement left unclear what long-term direction AECL would take for its medical isotope production business.

They competed throughout the 1980s in Britain, North America and Japan and are consistently ranked among the top tag teams in history. Both Smith and Billington incurred premature deaths. Background Tom Billington (Dynamite Kid) and David Smith (Davey Boy Smith) were first cousins from the Lancashire town of Wigan in the United Kingdom. Tom and Davey Boy are both grandsons of Joe and Nellie Billington. Tom's father, Billy Billington, was the brother of Davey Boy's mother, Joyce Billington Smith. In the 1970s, the Dynamite Kid and Davey Boy Smith both began their careers in Britain. The two were soon invited to join Stampede Wrestling in Canada by talent scout Bruce Hart. The Dynamite Kid went to Canada first and made a revolutionary impact in Stampede with his effortlessly fluid technical wrestling style, and had a fiery feud with his future brother-in-law, Bret Hart. Davey Boy Smith came to Stampede in the early 1980s. During their time together in Stampede, Dynamite and Davey Boy began a heated feud as Dynamite provoked Smith by saying he was \\"a test-tube baby\\". History =Early years (1983‚Äì1984)= The Dynamite / Davey Boy feud would continue in New Japan Pro Wrestling, where they became involved in a three-way feud that also involved The Cobra over the NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship. After they settled the feud, the two started to team as the British Bulldogs both in NJPW and Stampede Wrestling. In March 1984, the Bulldogs would win the Stampede International Tag Team Championship for the first time. In 1984, the two left NJPW to go to its bitter rival All Japan Pro Wrestling, effectively severing all ties to New Japan to this day. =World Wrestling Federation (1984‚Äì1988)= In 1984, Vince McMahon bought out Stampede Wrestling. The buyout meant that the British Bulldogs joined the World Wrestling Federation along with Smith's brother-in-law Bret Hart and Jim Neidhart (The Hart Foundation). Initially the Bulldogs still toured with AJPW, but soon after they became WWF-exclusive. Although the two British stars primarily wrestled against each other in Stampede Wrestling, with Billington as a villain and Smith as a hero, WWF owner Vince McMahon decided to make them only as a tag team. The British Bulldogs' first and probably most well known feud was with the Hart Foundation, whom they knew well from their Stampede days, and thus were able to produce a series of outstanding matches that helped elevate both teams in the WWF. The Bulldogs next major feud was with the then-WWF World Tag Team Champions, \\"The Dream Team\\" of Greg Valentine and Brutus Beefcake. The Bulldogs wrestled Valentine and Beefcake for close to a year, coming close to but never winning the tag titles. The stage was set for a \\"final\\" tag title match at WrestleMania 2. With \\"Captain\\" Lou Albano and Ozzy Osbourne in their corner, the duo won the WWF World Tag-Team titles. The Bulldogs continued their feud with the Dream Team and also defended regularly against the former championship team of The Iron Sheik & Nikolai Volkoff. In December 1986, Dynamite Kid suffered a serious back injury during a match in Hamilton, Ontario, forcing him out of the ring for a longer period of time (during this period Davey Boy Smith would defend the titles with various replacement partners). On January 26, 1987, the British Bulldogs lost the titles to the Hart Foundation in a match that saw Dynamite Kid so debilitated that he was carried to the ring by Davey Boy Smith and saw little physical action after being \\"knocked out\\" by the megaphone of the Hart Foundation's manager Jimmy Hart before he even got into the ring. ‚ÄúEvil Referee‚Äù Danny Davis then allowed the Foundation to continually double team Davey Boy in order to get the win (all the while continuing to \\"check\\" on Dynamite, leaving the double teaming to take place). The match would air on February 7 on WWF Superstars of Wrestling. After being given time off to recuperate, the Bulldogs returned to the ring to continue their feud with the Hart Foundation and Davis (who, in the storyline, cheated to help the Hart Foundation win the title). The teams met at WrestleMania III, where the Bulldogs teamed with Tito Santana to take on the trio. The Harts and Davis would win the match when Davis hit Smith with Jimmy Hart's megaphone behind the referee's back and covered him for the win. Towards the end of the Bulldogs' title reign, they had been given a live bulldog named Matilda, who would accompany them to the ring. Matilda was central to the Bulldogs' feud with The Islanders (Haku and Tama) who along with their manager Bobby \\"The Brain\\" Heenan \\"dognapped\\" her. After rescuing Matilda, the Bulldogs teamed with Koko B. Ware (and his parrot \\"Frankie\\") in a six-man tag team match against The Islanders and Bobby Heenan at Wrestlemania IV. The match ended with a loss as Heenan covered Koko for the 3-count. The Bulldogs then went on to a feud with The Rougeau Brothers (Jacques and Raymond) which included wrestling the first ever match at the inaugural SummerSlam PPV at Madison Square Garden which ended in a time limit (20 minute) draw. The Bulldogs' last pay-per-view was the 1988 Survivor Series. They wrestled in a twenty-man (10 team) tag team elimination match notable for Mr. Fuji turning against his Tag Team Champions Demolition (Ax and Smash) and joining their rival The Powers of Pain (The Barbarian and The Warlord) in a double switch with Demolition turning face and the Powers of Pain turning heel. The Powers of Pain won the match by eliminating the heel team Los Conquistadores, thus giving their team (which included The Bulldogs who had earlier been eliminated when Smash pinned Dynamite) the victory. The Bulldogs left the WWF after backstage pranks and altercations with The Rougeau Brothers after bullying Jacques and beat him really hard because he didn't want to go out to the bar. which led to Jacques Rougeau knocking several of Dynamite's teeth out with a suckerpunch (Rougeau was actually carrying a bunch of quarters in his fist to make the punch harder).\\"Backstage Heat: Jacques Rougeau & The Dynamite Kid\\", by Ralph A. Eichenlaud, OnlineWorldofWrestling.com Billington himself, however, claimed that the Rougeau incident was not the final straw that drove him to leave the WWF. Rather, he stated, it was a dispute with WWF management over issuing of complimentary plane tickets, over which he resigned from the company on principle and, to his surprise in retrospect, Smith followed suit.Tom Billington, Pure Dynamite =Stampede Wrestling and All Japan Pro Wrestling (1988‚Äì1990)= After leaving the WWF, the Bulldogs returned to their old ‚Äúhome‚Äù in Stampede Wrestling and also resumed touring with All Japan Pro Wrestling, where they had moderate success as a tag team, but it was not as magical seeing these two wrestle there, as years of steroid abuse made them too large, physique-wise, and Dynamite Kid's back injury from years prior had made his previously exciting moveset more limited. They had feuds with the Cuban Commandos and Karachi Vice in Stampede and won the Stampede International Tag-Team titles for the second time on December 12, 1988. After losing the titles to Karachi Vice on December 30, 1988, Dynamite Kid became involved in a brutal feud with Johnny Smith in February 1989, after Johnny interfered and attacked Dynamite, before cutting his hair. In May 1989, the Bulldogs split up in Stampede, but remained a team in AJPW at Giant Baba's request. Over in Stampede, the Bulldogs feuded with each other, with Dynamite forming The British Bruisers with Johnny Smith and Davey Boy Smith teaming with a young Chris Benoit. In September 1990, Davey Boy Smith abruptly withdrew the Bulldogs from AJPW's annual World's Strongest Tag Determination League by returning to the WWF, and fabricating to the All-Japan office that Dynamite was in a serious car accident and couldn't compete. Since Davey Boy Smith had trademarked the term \\"The British Bulldog\\" during the Bulldogs' previous run in the WWF, he decided to return to the WWF as The British Bulldog and would send people to the United Kingdom to warn the promoter every time a flyer was distributed promoting Dynamite Kid as a \\"British Bulldog.\\" As a result of these actions, Dynamite passionately despised Smith for a long time. Johnny Smith would end up taking Davey Boy Smith's spot in the World's Strongest Tag Determination League, and the duo (known as The British Bruisers) continued to compete in All-Japan Pro Wrestling. The duo managed to capture the All Asia Tag Team Championship, but the partnership was short- lived; the years of steroid abuse, working a high-impact style and cocaine usage caught up with \\"the Dynamite Kid\\" Thomas Billington as he suddenly announced his retirement on December 6, 1991, although he made the occasional comeback and wrestled his last match on 10 October 1996. After the breakup of The British Bulldogs tag team, Davey Boy Smith wrestled for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) from 1990‚Äì1992, 1994‚Äì1997 and 1999‚Äì2000, and for World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in 1993 and 1998. Davey Boy Smith died of a heart attack on 18 May 2002 at the age of 39. The Dynamite Kid, who had been in a wheelchair since August 1997, died on 5 December 2018 on his 60th birthday, The British Bulldogs were made into action figures, first in 1986 during the LJN WWF Wrestling Superstars line and in the mid 2000s Classic Superstars line by Jakks Pacific.They were available separate as well as packaged together. The Classic Superstars double pack even included their bulldog mascot, Matilda. Both versions are highly sought after by collectors and prices can be well over hundreds of dollars in mint condition especially for Billington, as figures of him were not produced as much as Smith, who gained fame in both WWF and WCW after the Bulldogs' split while Billington wrestled primarily overseas, most notably in Japan and whose career was cut short due to injuries. Many collectors who have obtained the figures consider them among their most prized pieces.

It is the administrative centre of the homonymous Aytos Municipality. As of December 2009, the town has a population of 21,067 inhabitants. 2014 Census, Aytos population  History  Aytos has a rich and long history dating back to antiquity. An old settlement founded by Thracian tribes, archaeological finds near the town testify that its existence dates back to the 5th century BC. Throughout the centuries, the town has been known under different names including Aet√≤s (in Greek ŒëŒµœÑœåœÇ meaning eagle), Ast√≤s (ŒëœÉœÑœåœÇ), Eidos (ŒïŒØŒ¥ŒøœÇ), Aquilia, Tchengis, etc. During the reign of Khan Tervel, the region was incorporated in the Bulgarian Empire for the first time. The fortress Aetos took an important part in the defensive system of the Bulgarian lands against the sudden attacks of the Tatars, the Avars and the Crusaders. In 1206, Aytos together with many cities in Bulgarian province of Thrace was destroyed by the Crusaders, led by Henry of Flanders. Henry of Flanders was a brother of Baldwin I, emperor of Latin Empire of Constantinople. A fortified city was rebuilt at 1488. In 1378 the town was conquered by the armies of the Ottoman Empire under Murad I. During the Russian-Turkish War (1828‚Äì1829), General Hans Karl von Diebitsch turned the town into a strategic strong point. After the Treaty of Edirne in 1829, many of the town's citizens fled to Bessarabia to join the Bessarabian Bulgarians. During the Bulgarian National Revival the population participated in the Bulgarian struggles for liberation. Vasil Levski organized a revolutionary committee in the town. After the Liberation, Aytos became a commercial center, reputedly more important than Burgas. The first girls' agricultural school in the country was established in Aytos during the period.  Transport  The geographic location determines the special significance of the municipality as a transport junction, where the road networks between Northern Bulgaria and Southern Bulgaria in this part of the country join. Important highways and the railway from Sofia to Burgas pass through it. Its good transport characteristics are also determined by the fact that it is only 28 km from Burgas, a key Black Sea port.  Climate   Culture  The town hosts the annual folk festival and competition Slaveevi Noshti, which takes place every Spring during the months of May and June. The festival is held at the \\"Slaveeva Reka\\" Recreational Park and it celebrates traditional dance and folk music from across Bulgaria. Demography The town of Aytos has 19,327 inhabitants as of December 2018. POPULATION BY TOWNS AND SEX AS OF 31.12.2018 Most inhabitants are ethnic Bulgarians (68%), followed by large Turkish (17%) and Roma minorities (14%).

He is also the founder and chairman of the People's Islamic Unity Party of Afghanistan. During the 1980s, he served with the mujahideen rebel forces fighting against the Soviet-backed Afghan government. After the withdrawal of the Soviet Union in 1989, Mohaqiq was appointed as the leader of the Hezb-e Wahdat for northern Afghanistan.  Early years  Mohaqiq was born in 1955 and hails from Mazar- e-Sharif in Balkh Province. He is an ethnic Hazara, the son of Sarwar. He holds a bachelor's degree in Islamic studies from Iran. Mohaqiq speaks Persian, Uzbek and Arabic. He has been involved in Mujahideen activities after the April 1978 Saur Revolution. Political career During the Afghan civil war in the early 1990s, he was regarded as a prominent leader fighting for his Hazara people. In the late 1990s, Mohaqiq joined the Northern Alliance (United Front) in their resistance and struggle against the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (Taliban). After the fall of the Taliban, he was appointed as the Vice President and the Minister of Planning in the interim government of Hamid Karzai. Mohaqiq ran as a candidate in the 2004 Afghan presidential election. He came in third place with 11.7% of the votes after Hamid Karzai and Yunus Qanuni. A January 2009 article by Ahmad Majidyar of the American Enterprise Institute included Mohaqiq on a list of fifteen possible candidates in the 2009 Afghan presidential election. In the end, however, Mohaqiq opted to support President Karzai against his main challenger Abdullah Abdullah in the election. In 2010, Mohaqiq stopped supporting President Karzai because of Karzai's policy of appeasement towards the Taliban insurgents.\\"Minority leaders leaving Karzai's side over leader's overtures to insurgents\\" In late 2011, Mohaqiq, Ahmad Zia Massoud and Abdul Rashid Dostum created the National Front of Afghanistan (also Afghanistan National Front, ANF). From 2014 until 2019 he served as the second deputy of the chief executive Abdullah Abdullah, at the end of January 2019 he was dismissed by the president Ashraf Ghani under the Article 13 Item 64 of the National constitute of Afghanistan. But later he refused his dismissal and continued attending Official meetings with Dr. Abdullah Abdullah.

The first group of interfaces combined various user input modes beyond the traditional keyboard and mouse input/output, such as speech, pen, touch, manual gestures,Kettebekov, Sanshzar, and Rajeev Sharma (2001). \\"Toward Natural Gesture/Speech Control of a Large Display.\\" ProceedingsEHCI '01 Proceedings of the 8th IFIP International Conference on Engineering for Human-Computer Interaction Pages 221-234 gaze and head and body movements.Marius Vassiliou, V.

McGee (2000), \\"Integrated Multimodal Human-Computer Interface and Augmented Reality for Interactive Display Applications,\\" in Darrel G. Hopper (ed.) Cockpit Displays VII: Displays for Defense Applications (Proc. SPIE . 4022), 106-115. The most common such interface combines a visual modality (e.g. a display, keyboard, and mouse) with a voice modality (speech recognition for input, speech synthesis and recorded audio for output). However other modalities, such as pen-based input or haptic input/output may be used. Multimodal user interfaces are a research area in human-computer interaction (HCI). The advantage of multiple input modalities is increased usability: the weaknesses of one modality are offset by the strengths of another. On a mobile device with a small visual interface and keypad, a word may be quite difficult to type but very easy to say (e.g. Poughkeepsie). Consider how you would access and search through digital media catalogs from these same devices or set top boxes. And in one real-world example, patient information in an operating room environment is accessed verbally by members of the surgical team to maintain an antiseptic environment, and presented in near realtime aurally and visually to maximize comprehension. Multimodal input user interfaces have implications for accessibility. A well-designed multimodal application can be used by people with a wide variety of impairments. Visually impaired users rely on the voice modality with some keypad input. Hearing-impaired users rely on the visual modality with some speech input. Other users will be \\"situationally impaired\\" (e.g. wearing gloves in a very noisy environment, driving, or needing to enter a credit card number in a public place) and will simply use the appropriate modalities as desired. On the other hand, a multimodal application that requires users to be able to operate all modalities is very poorly designed. The most common form of input multimodality in the market makes use of the XHTML+Voice (aka X+V) Web markup language, an open specification developed by IBM, Motorola, and Opera Software. X+V is currently under consideration by the W3C and combines several W3C Recommendations including XHTML for visual markup, VoiceXML for voice markup, and XML Events, a standard for integrating XML languages. Multimodal browsers supporting X+V include IBM WebSphere Everyplace Multimodal Environment, Opera for Embedded Linux and Windows, and ACCESS Systems NetFront for Windows Mobile. To develop multimodal applications, software developers may use a software development kit, such as IBM WebSphere Multimodal Toolkit, based on the open source Eclipse framework, which includes an X+V debugger, editor, and simulator. = Multimodal sentiment analysis =  Multimodal output  The second group of multimodal systems presents users with multimedia displays and multimodal output, primarily in the form of visual and auditory cues. Interface designers have also started to make use of other modalities, such as touch and olfaction. Proposed benefits of multimodal output system include synergy and redundancy. The information that is presented via several modalities is merged and refers to various aspects of the same process. The use of several modalities for processing exactly the same information provides an increased bandwidth of information transfer . Currently, multimodal output is used mainly for improving the mapping between communication medium and content and to support attention management in data-rich environment where operators face considerable visual attention demands. An important step in multimodal interface design is the creation of natural mappings between modalities and the information and tasks. The auditory channel differs from vision in several aspects. It is omnidirectional, transient and is always reserved. Speech output, one form of auditory information, received considerable attention. Several guidelines have been developed for the use of speech. Michaelis and Wiggins (1982) suggested that speech output should be used for simple short messages that will not be referred to later. It was also recommended that speech should be generated in time and require an immediate response. The sense of touch was first utilized as a medium for communication in the late 1950s. It is not only a promising but also a unique communication channel. In contrast to vision and hearing, the two traditional senses employed in HCI, the sense of touch is proximal: it senses objects that are in contact with the body, and it is bidirectional in that it supports both perception and acting on the environment. Examples of auditory feedback include auditory icons in computer operating systems indicating users' actions (e.g. deleting a file, open a folder, error), speech output for presenting navigational guidance in vehicles, and speech output for warning pilots on modern airplane cockpits. Examples of tactile signals include vibrations of the turn-signal lever to warn drivers of a car in their blind spot, the vibration of auto seat as a warning to drivers, and the stick shaker on modern aircraft alerting pilots to an impending stall. Invisible interface spaces became available using sensor technology. Infrared, ultrasound and cameras are all now commonly used. Transparency of interfacing with content is enhanced providing an immediate and direct link via meaningful mapping is in place, thus the user has direct and immediate feedback to input and content response becomes interface affordance (Gibson 1979). Multimodal fusion The process of integrating information from various input modalities and combining them into a complete command is referred as multimodal fusion. In literature, three main approaches to the fusion process have been proposed, according to the main architectural levels (recognition and decision) at which the fusion of the input signals can be performed: recognition-based,Vo, M.T. (1998). \\"A framework and Toolkit for the Construction of Multimodal Learning Interfaces\\", PhD.

The recognition-based fusion (also known as early fusion) consists in merging the outcomes of each modal recognizer by using integration mechanisms, such as, for example, statistical integration techniques, agent theory, hidden Markov models, artificial neural networks, etc. Examples of recognition-based fusion strategies are action frame, input vectors and slots. The decision-based fusion (also known as late fusion) merges the semantic information that are extracted by using specific dialogue-driven fusion procedures to yield the complete interpretation. Examples of decision-based fusion strategies are typed feature structures, melting pots, semantic frames, and time-stamped lattices. The potential applications for multimodal fusion include learning environments, consumer relations, security/surveillance, computer animation, etc. Individually, modes are easily defined, but difficulty arises in having technology consider them a combined fusion. It's difficult for the algorithms to factor in dimensionality; there exist variables outside of current computation abilities. For example, semantic meaning: two sentences could have the same lexical meaning but different emotional information. In the hybrid multi-level fusion, the integration of input modalities is distributed among the recognition and decision levels. The hybrid multi-level fusion includes the following three methodologies: finite-state transducers, multimodal grammarsD'Ulizia, A.; Ferri, F.; Grifoni P.

Ambiguity User's actions or commands produce multimodal inputs (multimodal message), which have to be interpreted by the system. The multimodal message is the medium that enables communication between users and multimodal systems. It is obtained by merging information that are conveyed via several modalities by considering the different types of cooperation between several modalities,Martin, J.C. (1997). \\"Toward intelligent cooperation between modalities: the example of a system enabling multimodal interaction with a map\\", Proceedings of International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI'97) Workshop on 'Intelligent Multimodal Systems', Nagoya, Japan the time relationshipsAllen, J.F.; Ferguson, G.

An ambiguity arises when more than one interpretation of input is possible. A multimodal ambiguity arises both, if an element, which is provided by one modality, has more than one interpretation (i.e. ambiguities are propagated at the multimodal level), and/or if elements, connected with each modality, are univocally interpreted, but information referred to different modalities are incoherent at the syntactic or the semantic level (i.e. a multimodal sentence having different meanings or different syntactic structure). In \\"The Management of Ambiguities\\", the methods for solving ambiguities and for providing the correct interpretation of the user's input are organized in three main classes: prevention, a-posterior resolution and approximation resolution methods. Prevention methods impose users to follow predefined interaction behaviour according to a set of transitions between different allowed states of the interaction process. Example of prevention methods are: procedural method,Lee, Y.C.; Chin, F. (1995). \\"An Iconic Query Language for Topological Relationship in GIS\\".

Since 1999 his most widely distributed electronic music has been released under the name of The Flashbulb. Other names Benn has released as are Acidwolf, Human Action Network, and FlexE. Biography Jordan was born in 1979 and raised in West Englewood, Chicago, by his mother & grandparents. As an only child growing up in a derelict neighborhood, Jordan became an accomplished self-taught guitarist as a child. Due to being left-handed and not having lessons, he learned to play a right-handed guitar upside down, which he continues to do. He began his music career releasing instrumental music on small labels in the United States and Europe in 1996 under various aliases, most notably The Flashbulb. In addition to releasing music and touring, he began to work as a freelance composer for various television and film agencies. Musical style As The Flashbulb, Jordan typically releases electronic or cinematic styled music. His style differs strongly between albums, but they all have a cohesive bond tied around intricate drum programming, jazz-influenced melodies, and a wide array of live instrumentation from various instruments Jordan has acquired. He also often records his melodies through MIDI-synced guitars. His guitar style and skill have gained attention because he typically plays the guitar strung backwards, and makes heavy use of fast sweeping and tapping. More recent Flashbulb albums have featured violinist Greg Hirte, who is also featured heavily on The Flashbulb's 2008 album, Soundtrack to a Vacant Life. This album is, as Jordan stated in a 2008 interview, a step away from the breakcore genre. He also said that this step is likely to be a permanent trend in the direction of his music, a move that was supported by releases under his own name, such as Pale Blue Dot and Louisiana Mourning. However, the 2012 album Hardscrabble represents a return to the harder electronic music heard on releases like Kirlian Selections or Flexing Habitual. The record is named for an area in the Bridgeport neighborhood of Jordan's own Chicago. Under other aliases, Benn Jordan's work varies quite a bit. His Acidwolf and Human Action Network aliases feature retro acid music that uses old drum machines such as the TR-808 and relies heavily on the melodies of the TB-303. Tracks made under the FlexE alias tend to be laid-back and classic acid. According to him, he showcases his more fundamental, classical, and personal pieces under his own name, Benn Jordan. Composing for television and film Jordan has seen much success in composing for television and film. In 2006 he composed the original score for the Josh C. Waller short The Nail. In 2006, Jordan's music (\\"Passage D\\" from his album Kirlian Selections) was featured in Dove's \\"Evolution\\" promotional campaign for its Campaign for Real Beauty website, which has drawn a large amount of attention from the mainstream media. The campaign took the commercial film winner at Cannes, as well as many other prestigious awards. In addition, Jordan was nominated for a 2007 London International Award for the \\"Best Use Of Music\\" category; he went on to win the ceremony's grand prize. In 2008, he was nominated again at the London International Awards for \\"Best Use of Music,\\" although he did not take the grand prize. In 2008 he was also a Webby Award nominee and took the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival. In 2008, Jordan had completed work in branding, having created stings and trademark sounds for companies such as Dove, Verizon, and others. In July 2012, he released an original score entitled The Universe, which was commissioned by Chicago's Adler Planetarium for a new interactive exhibit dedicated to the evolution of the universe. In 2013, he was commissioned to score their show entitled \\"Cosmic Wonder\\".Cosmic Wonder Press Release - Adler Planetarium In 2016 he composed the soundtrack to the Adler Planetarium's sky show Planet Nine.'Planet Nine,' Adler's best sky show yet, chronicles quest for a Pluto replacement - Chicago Tribune Jordan currently composes for film, television, and gaming through various agencies; he also currently owns and operates his own production and recording facilities in Smyrna, Georgia. Alphabasic and music piracy After the collapse of Sublight Records, instead of taking on another contract, Jordan purchased his previous licenses and released his most anticipated album, Soundtrack to a Vacant Life, on his own record label, Alphabasic Records. On the day of its release, he personally uploaded copies of the album to music piracy sites, including a small HTML file explaining his relaxed views on file sharing and showing listeners where they could give support if they desired. This resulted in attention by the mainstream press, and the album became the most downloaded album on many popular file sharing networks. Jordan has spoken extensively on issues of net neutrality, free speech, and copyright laws in the music world. In an interview with TorrentFreak, he encourages involvement in these issues and warns against corporations like Amazon or iTunes and their ability to stem the free flow of information. File sharing, to Jordan, is a way of bypassing this potential oppression and accessing information freely. In the aforementioned interview, Jordan notes that \\"file trading is just a peephole to a much larger picture. Copyright, in its current state, holds information at ransom for monetary value. While in music it can stifle culture and art, with literature and education it can be nothing less than a weapon of class warfare.\\"  YouTube  Jordan has a self-titled YouTube channel (previously titled Benn and Gear). On his channel, he creates educational videos relating to music making. In 2020, Jordan was formally threatened with legal action after posting a video about LRADs.@bennjordan. \\"I've been formally threatened with a lawsuit pertaining to my LRAD video/posts. I have representation and will be defending myself accordingly, but this puts limits on how I can discuss the technology or intent of these devices. Please stay safe in our battle for a better future.\\" Twitter, 5 June 2020, 12:41 p.m. Accessed 2 July 2020. Philanthropy Benn Jordan was the founder and president of 32 Forty, a non- profit music education center located in south Chicago. The music center (now closed), extended services to help independent recording artists with publishing and licensing. In 2011, Jordan released a large collection of unreleased music, titled \\"Old Trees (1999-2011)\\" with all proceeds going to Unicef. Jordan is also an ambassador for Unearthed Pictures, a foundation dedicated to publicizing and stopping the sexual exploitation of children and funding safe houses in North America, Africa, and Asia. Personal life In 2014, Jordan left Chicago and moved his home studio to an isolated home in Smyrna, Georgia. He trains and competes in mixed martial arts and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu in his spare time.

The band's most recent lineup before going on hiatus consisted of Richard Archer (lead vocals and guitar), Kai Stephens (bass guitar and backing vocals) and Steve Kemp (drums and backing vocals). Founding member Ross Phillips (guitar and backing vocals) left the band on 6 May 2013 but returned in 2014 to promote the release of their greatest hits album, Best of 2004 ‚Äì 2014, and the one-off gig on 13 February 2014. They achieved chart success with their third single, \\"Hard to Beat\\"\\"Music Charts: \\"Hard-Fi - Hard to Beat\\". aCharts.us. and then followed by other successful singles such as \\"Living for the Weekend\\"\\"Music Charts: \\"Hard-Fi - Living for the Weekend\\". aCharts.us. and \\"Cash Machine\\",\\"Music Charts: \\"Hard-Fi - Cash Machine\\". aCharts.us. which all reached the top 15 of the UK Singles Chart.\\"Music Charts: \\"Hard-Fi\\". aCharts.us. Their debut album Stars of CCTV was released on 4 July 2005,Hard-Fi : Discography and although receiving critical acclaim (NME called it the 23rd best album of 2005 and it was nominated for the Mercury Prize and two Brit Awards; Best British Group and Best British Rock Act), it did not reach No. 1 on the UK Albums Chart until six months later on 22 January 2006.\\"Music Charts: \\"Hard-Fi - Stars of CCTV\\". aCharts.us. It originally entered the charts at number 6. The band's second album Once Upon a Time in the West was released on 3 September 2007 and reached number 1 in its first week.\\"Music Charts: \\"Hard-Fi - Once Upon a Time in the West\\". aCharts.us. Their third album Killer Sounds, which features the singles \\"Good for Nothing\\", \\"Fire in the House\\" and \\"Bring It On\\", was released on 19 August 2011 and debuted at number 9 on the UK Albums Chart. They stated that they were heavily influenced by soul and dance music. History =1997‚Äì2001: Contempo= Richard Archer decided to return to his hometown of Staines, crushed by the lack of success of his former band Contempo and the death of his father from cancer. He said \\"I moved back to Staines because I ran out of money and it was quite a shock.\\" Archer claims that music business insiders tried to dissuade the band's manager Warren Clarke from managing him. When Archer asked his publishers for some money to record the new songs that he had written, they terminated his contract instead. \\"People told him, don't bother with Archer, he's damaged goods, you're wasting your time.\\" =2001‚Äì2004: Formation and early success= While Archer was making demos to produce an album, he went into the Staines hi-fi shop where Ross Phillips worked, simply so he could listen to his latest demos on the shop's best equipment. Philips apparently asked Archer who had played guitar on his demos and Archer said that it was himself. Phillips said it was \\"shit\\" and was therefore recruited to play guitar for the new group. Steve Kemp was already an old friend of Archer, while it took Kai Stephens little persuasion to leave his job as a \\"pest killer\\" at Rentokil. When Stephens played guitar before joining Hard-Fi, he liked to copy chords from bands such as Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd who are two of his favourite artists along with The Clash and hip-hop acts such as Run DMC and N.W.A. The band were signed to newly formed independent label Necessary Records, owned by Clarke. The majority of Stars of CCTV was recorded in a variety of unusual acoustic environments - in bedrooms, in pubs, and played back in their producer, Wolsey White's, BMW. 1000 copies of this record were pressed with only 500 going on public sale, and the initial plan was to sell 1000 each time. However, it quickly sold out, receiving critical acclaim and radio play, proving a lot more successful than the band had imagined. Most of the album was recorded in a disused mini cab office, which cost them about ¬£300 and is known to this day as the \\"Cherry Lips\\" Studio. The band used to try to make their music sound more atmospheric by putting a microphone in the corridor to add echo; listening closely to the record reveals that this also picked up passers-by humming and whistling and the occasional aeroplane flying overhead. Archer desperately tried to generate publicity for the band through the Staines Observer, to no avail; \\"We sent them a press release and a photo,\\" said Archer. \\"The press release was all like, the hard-hitting sound of the streets and stuff. And the article came out going, 'Richard Archer, former pupil of Thamesmead School ...' Whatever you say, they seem to be most interested in what school you went to.\\" The band were then licensed to the major label Atlantic Records in December 2004, where they were given the chance to re-record the album in the renowned Abbey Road Studios, among other well known studios, however they went back to the cab office to maintain their sound. =2005‚Äì2006: Stars of CCTV= The band were one of the acts opening for Green Day, alongside Taking Back Sunday and Jimmy Eat World on their two- day residency of the Milton Keynes Bowl in June 2005. Simple Plan were initially booked though cancelled only a few weeks before the show, and Hard- Fi were made as a last minute booking and opened on both days. Their debut album's launch party was scheduled to be 7 July 2005 at Cheekees nightclub in Staines, however this was cancelled due to the ill health of Richard's mother, and the London bombings also occurring that day. Her death resulted in the band pulling out of the Glastonbury festival. The launch party was rescheduled for 13 July 2005 and the venue changed to Ladbroke Grove, London. The Stars of CCTV album re-entered the official UK album chart at No. 4 on 1 January 2006. Two places higher than it originally went in on the week of its release, the album climbed from No. 33\\\\. Stars of CCTV finally got to No. 1 on 22 January. The band's re-release of \\"Cash Machine\\" entered the official Top 40 singles chart at No. 14 on 1 January. The album has reached sales of 1.2 million copies worldwide and sales of over 600,000 in the UK alone. Hard-Fi gained increased prominence in the UK when Stars of CCTV was nominated for the 2005 Mercury Music Prize. Stars of CCTV scored 74 out of 100 on Metacritic. In February 2006, the band were nominated for two BRIT Awards, Best British Group and Best British Rock Act, alongside international superstars such as Gorillaz, Franz Ferdinand and Oasis. Richard spoke about the nominations, \\"I don't think we'll win it, especially best group when you've got Coldplay, Franz Ferdinand and Gorillaz in there, they're kind of big hitters, but you never know, Burton drew with Man United\\". \\"Last week I would have probably said 'nah it's all rubbish', but now I'm nominated it's great but what is good is that there's a real wide spread of stuff there, but there's no Best Dance award and the urban category is more pop than what's quality.\\" =2007: Once Upon a Time in the West= Hard-Fi expanded the \\"Cherry Lips\\", their taxi cab office which they used to record, making more room for equipment after having searched fruitlessly for a space. Archer described the record as \\"darker and more expansive\\". A working title for the Album was \\"Bat out of Staines\\". The first single from the album was \\"Suburban Knights\\", released on 20 August. The single had its first play on 18 June 2007, at 7:20 pm (BST) on Radio 1. The album Once Upon a Time in the West was released on 3 September 2007 when the band launched it at midnight in Virgin Megastore in Oxford Street, London with a live performance from a selected set list followed by a CD signing. The following day, the band performed at Maida Vale Studios to a small audience who earned their tickets through Radio 1. The album cover of Once Upon a Time in the West has an orange background with the album title at the top, and \\"NO COVER ART.\\" written in large, white letters below. The artwork has received criticism, however, top cover art designer Peter Saville has described it as \\"a 'White Album' for the digital culture.\\" On 9 September 2007, Once Upon a Time in the West went straight in at No. 1 on the UK Albums Chart, giving Hard-Fi a second No. 1 album. It received positive reviews including five stars from The Observer MonthlyObserver Music Monthly 24 and four stars from Q Magazine, scoring 70 out of 100 on Metacritic. The album was more popular than their debut album Stars of CCTV in other countries, as it reached Japan's Top 10 chart. Mexico, Argentina, Brazil and Central America began to show interest in the band as the first single from the album, \\"Suburban Knights\\", charted in all of their respective charts, reaching No. 5 in Peru, No. 3 in Guatemala, No. 2 El Salvador, No. 8 Mexico alongside their second single \\"Can't Get Along (Without You)\\" which spent two weeks on No. 1 in Peru and Argentina. On 10 March 2008, the third single, \\"I Shall Overcome\\" was released in the UK, where it reached No. 35, whilst making the top five in South America just like the previous two singles entering in at No. 4. =2008‚Äì2011: Killer Sounds= During the 2008 Christmas period, Hard-Fi released a Christmas message to their fans announcing that they would be back in the new year with \\"a wicked new album\\". On 2 February 2009, Phillips released a blog on the band's official Myspace page, saying \\"me and the boys are now back in the cherry lips recording facility working hard on the new tunes. Sounding great by the way. We're really pleased with how the album's shaping up. Hopefully over the next few months we'll put some bits and pieces up for you to have a listen.\\" On 29 October 2010, Hard-Fi made a blog posting on their website stating that they were starting production on their new album.Steve's Blog: \\"Scary Monsters and Super Freaks\\" On 14 February 2011, Archer posted an update on the band's Facebook page, which revealed that six of the eleven album tracks had been mixed. Producers that worked with Hard-Fi on their third album include Stuart Price and Greg Kurstin. On 7 March, Hard-Fi confirmed that they are getting closer to completing the album. Archer posted a status on Facebook, saying \\"going back into the studio to mix the final tracks for the album, we've got two weeks booked to finish off and tweak a few bits and pieces from the last batch. Thinking about photos, a video, artwork and getting out and doing a few gigs - sooner than you might think.\\" On 28 April, Hard-Fi's latest single \\"Good for Nothing\\" was premiered on Zane Lowe's Radio 1 show receiving airplay as the 'Hottest Record in the World'. In an accompanying Archer announced that the album is called Killer Sounds. On 7 May, \\"Good for Nothing\\" was featured on Soccer AM's Premier League goals portion of the show. The single was then made available to listen to on Hard-Fi's official YouTube channel. Having been made available for listening on Hard-Fi's website since 22 May, \\"Good for Nothing\\" was finally released on 17 June and debuted on the UK Singles Chart at number No. 10 and on the UK Rock Chart at No. 2\\\\. The second single to be released from the album was \\"Fire in the House\\" on 7 August 2011. Killer Sounds was officially released in the UK, Ireland and other European territories on 22 August and entered the UK Albums Chart at No. 9\\\\. \\"Bring It On\\", the third and final single, was released on 24 October 2011. Following unspecified legal difficulties, the album's USA & Canada release date was delayed until 15 March 2013. =2012‚Äì2014: Greatest hits album and hiatus= In March 2012, Archer told Gigwise that Hard-Fi are hoping to release their next album in a shorter interval than the four years between Once Upon a Time in the West and Killer Sounds, although no estimated release date was set. The band released some samples of studio material from their upcoming album via their official Facebook page in March 2013. On 6 May 2013, the band announced via their Facebook page that Phillips was leaving the band to concentrate on 'different things'. On 27 November 2013, it was announced that Hard-Fi would be releasing a greatest hits compilation album called Hard-Fi: Best of 2004 ‚Äì 2014. The album was released on 27 January 2014. They also played a one-off sell out gig at the Bloomsbury Ballroom in London on 13 February 2014 along with Phillips. The band hasn't released any music since and said on Twitter they're on a hiatus when some people believed they had disbanded. Musical style Hard-Fi's lyrics are based mostly on working class life, the band themselves coming from a self-sufficient suburban lifestyle in Staines. Most notable in tracks such as \\"Suburban Knights\\" (\\"Those bills keep dropping through my door\\") and \\"Living for the Weekend\\" (\\"I've been working all week - I'm tired\\"), while other songs such as \\"Tonight\\", despite still being about suburban life, focus more on ambitions. Some songs are also based on social realism, \\"Feltham is Singing Out\\" is inspired by Zahid Mubarek who was sent to the Feltham Young Offenders' Institution and was murdered by his racist cellmate. Other songs, such as \\"Better Do Better\\" and \\"Move on Now\\", are centred around the premise of how hard romantic relationships can be. Once Hard-Fi were becoming successful, Richard's mother died and the song \\"Help Me Please\\" is about how difficult it was for him having his dreams come true after many unsuccessful bands but realises he has no parents to share the joy with. Similarly, \\"The King\\" is about Richard returning to Staines and finding everything completely different, and realising everything of which he knew and loved had disappeared. He describes \\"Little Angel\\" as Christina Aguilera having a fight with The Clash in a Northern Soul club. Name \\"Hard-Fi\\" is the name given to the sound produced by Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry, a reggae and dub artist, at his Black Ark recording studio. Being admirers of Perry's work, the band named themselves after his distinctive sound. Archer said \\"Since then I've been desperately trying to find the biography where I read it; but I may have dreamt it.\\" Live Hard-Fi in concert at Sala Caracol in Madrid, Spain, 2006 Hard-Fi's first live performance was at Manchester's \\"In the City\\" music event in 2003 before they were signed to a record label. They played London's Brixton Academy from 14 to 18 May, making them one of the few bands to play five consecutive sold-out nights there and the first to do so off the back of their debut album. After the success of the Stars of CCTV album and of hit single \\"Hard to Beat\\", it allowed them to end up in a mini-reunion of The Specials, performing \\"Ghost Town\\" with Jerry Dammers and Neville Staples at the Love Music Hate Racism gig. Mick Jones of The Clash is a renowned fan of the band, while Paul Weller came to their rehearsal rooms and jammed a version of \\"Town Called Malice\\", something of which Kaichen Stephens says \\"gives us bragging rights over all of Staines\\". All of these artists were quite inspirational towards Hard-Fi while they were recording Stars of CCTV, perhaps The Specials and The Clash being the larger influences. Mick Jones also appeared with them performing \\"E=MC¬≤\\" by his former band Big Audio Dynamite. Jones had previously helped produce tracks by Richard Archer's prior band, Contempo who had recorded a cover of \\"London's Burning\\" by The Clash. Hard-Fi supported Green Day at their two gigs at Milton Keynes Bowl, performing in front of approximately 65,000 people. During December 2005, the band played at London's Astoria. The performance was filmed and released In Operation on DVD. The performance features all the tracks on Stars of CCTV plus \\"You And Me\\" and the band's version of \\"Seven Nation Army\\" by The White Stripes. It also comes with CCTVersions ‚Äì a CD featuring dubbed versions of album tracks, produced by guests including Roots Manuva and DJ Wrongtom. In February 2006, Hard-Fi played the Hammersmith Palais as part of the NME Awards shows with regular early touring partners Boy Kill Boy. The band played a series of sold-out, intimate dates later in July 2007 previewing the record. The UK Festival Awards nominated the event in the category for Most Memorable Moment.UK Festival Awards (2007) :: Glastonbury Festival 2007 Each concert from the band's December UK Tour was recorded in its entirety on audio CD which could be ordered online through Concert Live or bought at the venue for ¬£20.Concert Live  Live CDs  Hard-Fi  Once Upon a Time in December The CD was titled Once Upon a Time in December.

There are many different types of beneficiation, with each step furthering the concentration of the original ore.  History  Iron beneficiation has been evident since as early as 800 BCE in China with the use of bloomery. A bloomery is the original form of smelting and allowed people to make fires hot enough to melt oxides into a liquid that separates from the iron. Although the bloomery was promptly phased out by the invention of the blast furnace, it was still heavily relied on in Africa and Europe until the early part of the second millennium. The blast furnace was the next step in smelting iron which produced pig iron. The first blast furnaces in Europe appeared in the early 1200's around Sweden and Belgium, and not until the late 1400's in England. The pig iron poured from a blast furnace is high in carbon making it hard and brittle, making it hard to work with. In 1856 the Bessemer process was invented that turn the brittle pig iron into steel, a more malleable metal. Since then, many different technologies have been invented to replace the Bessemer process such as the electric arc furnace, basic oxygen steelmaking, and direct reduced iron (DRI). For sulfide ores, a different process is taken for beneficiation. The ore needs to have the sulfur removed before smelting can begin. Roasting is the primary method of separating, where wood was placed on heaps of ore and set on fire to help with oxidation. 2 Cu2S + 3 O2 ‚Üí 2 Cu2O + 2 SO2 The earliest practices of roasting were done outside, allowing large clouds of sulfur dioxide to blow over the land causing serious harm to surrounding ecosystems, both aquatic and terrestrial. The clouds of sulfur dioxide combined with local deforestation for wood needed for roasting compounded damages to the environment, as seen in Sudbury, Ontario and the Inco Superstack.  Types of Separation  = Disaggregation = Beneficiation can begin within the mine itself. Most mines will have a crusher within the mine itself where separation of ore and gangue minerals occurs and as a side effect becomes easier to transport. After the crusher the ore will go through a grinder or a mill to get the ore into fine particles. Dense media separation (DMS) is used to further separate the desired ore from rocks and gangue minerals. This will stratify the crushed aggregate by density making separation easier. Where the DMS occurs in the process can be important, the grinders or mills will process much less waste rock if the DMS occurs beforehand. This will lower wear on the equipment as well as operating costs since there is a lower volume being put through. = Physical Separation = After the milling stage the ore can be further separated from the rock. One way this can be achieved is by using the physical properties of the ore to separate it from the rest of the rock. These processes are gravity separation, flotation, and magnetic separation. Gravity separation uses centrifugal forces and specific gravity of ores and gangue to separate them. Magnetic separation is used to separate magnetic gangue from the desired ore, or conversely to remove a magnetic target ore from nonmagnetic gangue. DMS is also considered a physical separation. = Chemical Separation = Some ore physical properties can not be relied on for separation, therefore chemical processes are used to separate the ores from the rock. Froth flotation, leaching, and electrowinning are the most common types of chemical separation. Froth flotation uses hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties to separate the ore from the gangue. Hydrophobic particles will rise to the top of the solution to be skimmed off. Changes to pH in the solution can influence what particles will be hydrophilic. Leaching works by dissolving the desired ore into solution from the rock. Electrowinning is not a primary method of separation, but is required to get the ore out of solution after leaching.  Case Examples  In the case of gold, after adsorbing onto carbon, it is put into a sodium hydroxide and cyanide solution. In the solution the gold is pulled of the carbon and into the solution. The gold ions are removed from solution at steel wool cathodes from electrowinning. The gold then goes of to be smelted. Lithium is hard to separate from gangue due to similarities in the minerals. In order to separate the lithium both physical and chemical separation techniques are used. First froth flotation is used. Due to similarities in mineralogy there is not complete separation after flotation. The gangue that is found with lithium after the flotation are often iron bearing. The float concentrate goes through magnetic separation to remove the magnetic gangue from the nonmagnetic lithium.

According to practitioners, it was first brought to the West in the 1930s by Chan Kam Lee and was subsequently popularized by Chee Soo who was the President of the International Taoist Society from 1958 until his death in 1994.Taoist Ways of Healing by Chee Soo pages 139-140 (published by HarperCollins 1986) The Lee style of t'ai chi ch'uan comprises two forms known as 'the dance' or Ti√†o w«î Ë∑≥Ëàû, and 'the form'. Other exercises include I Fu Shou or 'sticky hands', Whirling Hands, Whirling Arms, and various qi and Li development exercises.The Chinese Art of T'ai Chi Ch'uan by Chee Soo, Seahorse Books 2003 Lee style t'ai chi is related to Martial Arts training, and there are five distinct areas of development that comprise the whole Art:The Chinese Art of T'ai Chi Ch'uan by Chee Soo, Seahorse Books 2003 chapter 2 - The principles of the Supreme Ultimate #Physical #Mental #Breathing #Sheng Qi ÁîüÊ∞î (Internal energy) #Ching Sheng Li Á≤æÁîüÂäõ (External energy).  History  According to Chee Soo the Lee style is the only true Taoist art and the oldest form of T'ai Chi Ch'uan in existence.The Chinese Art of T'ai Chi Ch'uan by Chee Soo, Aquarian Press 1984 pages 14-15 It is derived from an original set of eight movements created by Ho-Hsieh Lee from Beijing at the beginning of the Western Zhou dynasty around 1000 BC. His family moved to a fishing village called Weihaiwei on the East coast of China in Shandong Province and settled there and practised a range of Taoist Arts. The techniques were passed on from one generation to the next and kept within the family until the last in their line, Chan Kam Lee, fled the war torn China of the 1930s and emigrated to London to establish a business in the jewel trade. Here he met and adopted a young orphan named Chee Soo, and he passed the techniques on to him as he had no children of his own. In 1977 Chee Soo was interviewed by Brian Hayes on LBC radio and talked about Lee style T'ai Chi Ch'uan, and meeting his teacher Chan Kam Lee: > Chee Soo: It's rather curious, by a very strange coincidence, probably > another Chinese fairy tale really. When I left Doctor Barnardo homes at > fourteen years of age I became a page boy in Earl's Court in a nursing home, > and I used to go over to Hyde Park and have a kick around on my day off on > Sundays, and I happened to be playing with my ball when my ball actually hit > the back of the head of a gentleman sitting on a park bench. Interviewer: > Who was doing these gentle movements.

According to a British Movietone News documentary filmed on 21 May 1970 at Guildford in Surrey - UK, Chee Soo had over 2000 students studying Wu Shu in Britain as part of the British Wu Shu Association. In 1976 a book about Lee style T'ai Chi Ch'uan written by Chee Soo was published entitled \\"The Chinese Art of T'ai Chi Ch'uan\\" which describes the history and philosophy of the style in detail including descriptions of each aspect of the Art with photographs and descriptions of the Lee style T'ai Chi form. Chee Soo wrote several books about the various aspects of the Lee style Taoist Arts published by HarperCollins which became best-sellers and were subsequently licensed by HarperCollins to other major international publishers and translated into various languages including French (distributed in Canada, France, Belgium, Switzerland, Portugal), German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese (Brazilian), Polish, and Indonesian. According to an interview with Marilyn Soo - Chee Soo's widow and the President of the International Taoist Society - Chee Soo moved to Coventry in the 1980s and trained a group of teachers to continue his work teaching the Lee style Taoist Arts.The Tao of My Thoughts, Seahorse Books p127-150, Since his death in August 1994 there are now several schools teaching the Lee style T'ai Chi based in the British Isles each of which emphasise different aspects of the Lee style Taoist Arts. The emblem of the Lee family is the Seahorse which represents Yin within Yang as it is the only creature where the male incubates and gives birth to the offspring.The Taoist Art of Feng Shou by Chee Soo, Aquarian press (Thorsons/HarperCollins) 1983 Qigong Chee Soo's T'ai Chi classes invariably included Qigong or energy cultivation, and Tao Yin or breathing exercises.The Chinese Art of T'ai Chi Ch'uan by Chee Soo, Seahorse Books 2003 page 28 The Lee style qigong exercises are called K'ai Men (ÂºÄÈó®) or 'Open Door'. Chee Soo wrote a book published by HarperCollins in 1983 under the title \\"Chinese Yoga\\" (later re-titled \\"Taoist Yoga\\"), which was devoted entirely to this aspect of the Arts.The Taoist Art of K'ai Men by Chee Soo Seahorse Books 2006 This book contains details of Taoist alchemy energy cultivation methods involving deep breathing into the dantian or \\"Golden Stove\\" or \\"Lower Cauldron\\" in order to stimulate the flow of Chi or internal energy, circulating it through various energy centres located along the meridians and vessels which are usually associated with acupuncture and known as the Microcosmic orbit. Various types of breathing exercises are described and categorized in terms of Yin and Yang breathing The Taoist Art of Kai Men by Chee Soo Chapter 5 - Breath is Life (Seahorse Books 2006) and recommendations are given in terms of regulating the body in accordance with the peak of energy flowing through each organ and its corresponding line of meridian depending on the time of day and season of the year.The Taoist Art of Kai Men by Chee Soo Chapter 6 - Hints for Good Practice (Seahorse Books 2006) There are also various recommendations for constant good health regarding the Chang Ming diet or Chinese food therapy based on the underlying principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine.The Taoist Art of Kai Men by Chee Soo Chapter 4 - The Importance of Good Health (Seahorse Books 2006) An important aspect of this style of qigong is that it not only deals with qi or internal energy but also teaches the practitioner to supplement their personal store of ch'i with energy drawn from the energy field of the Universe itself which Chee Soo called external energy or 'Ching Sheng Li' (jƒ´ng shƒìng l√¨ Á≤æÁîüÂäõ).The Chinese Art of T'ai Chi Ch'uan by Chee Soo, Seahorse Books 2003 page 22  Forms  The Lee style includes a number of forms comprising set sequences of movements. These movements are based upon fourteen basic stances which are named after animal movements. These stances are also grouped into sequences with names like \\"Drive the Tiger Away\\" and \\"The Fair Lady Weaving\\". The movements can be performed at various speeds and may be timed with breathing. There are two forms known as the T'ai Chi Dance or which Chee Soo referred to as Ti√†ow«î Ë∑≥Ëàû and he said was about 400 years old,The Chinese Art of T'ai Chi Ch'uan by Chee Soo, Seahorse Books 2003 page 59 and the T'ai Chi form itself known as 'The Form'.The Chinese Art of T'ai Chi Ch'uan by Chee Soo, Seahorse Books 2003 page 67 The etymology of the Chinese ideogram Wu Ëàû suggests that the Lee style T'ai Chi dance may have its origins in Wu shamanism. The dance is 185 stances or steps long whereas the form is 140 stances split into 42 sequences. Sticky Hands The Lee style also includes various interactive exercises, the most important of which is called I Fu Shou or 'sticky hands'; similar to the pushing hands exercises that are seen in other T'ai Chi styles. Two people stand opposite each other making contact on the back of the wrist and move in circles gently testing each other's balance. The emphasis is on sensitivity and yielding to force. > I Fu Shou is an exercise in which two people participate. Each person tries > to upset the balance of the other whilst maintaining their own stability. > Contact is through the arms and hands throughout the exercise. No matter > what stance is adopted, there may always be a weakness in the balance of the > body whether one moves left or right, backward or forward, upward or > downward, and it is by taking advantage of these six directional weaknesses > that the participants in I Fu Shou try to ‚Äòuproot‚Äô each other - to cause the > other to lose their footing.

It is one of several Cadet youth organisations including the Army Cadet Force, Sea Cadets, Royal Marine Cadets, Air Training Corps and Fire Cadets. The Police Cadets teach young people skills in policing, and some may assist police officers with low-risk activities. The purpose of the VPC is not to recruit police officers of the future, but to encourage the spirit of adventure and good citizenship among its members. The Police Cadets were founded in their current form by the Metropolitan Police Service in 1988 and are organised based on the territorial police forces. Membership is open to youths aged 13-18, and some branches include Junior Volunteer Police Cadets for those aged 10-13. Though advertised as giving an \\"insight\\" into British policing, it does not guarantee future employment. The Aims of the VPC are:- *To promote a practical understanding of policing among all young people. *To encourage the spirit of adventure and good citizenship. *To support local policing priorities through volunteering and give young people a chance to be heard. * To inspire young people to participate positively in their communities. History Historically Police cadets were introduced in 1948, but then changes were made to the new system in 1959. The Metropolitan Police had the initial intention of boosting recruitment into the Metropolitan Police as, at that time recruitment was very low, and Police numbers in London were below (25,000) the 'establishment' figure of 28,000 police personnel. Police Officers were working two of their monthly 'rest days' and being paid for this work. Metropolitan Police Cadets were based originally in the former RAF Hendon buildings on Aerodrome Road and Police Cadets were all male aged 16 to 19 and they were paid a salary. They initially served two 'School terms' at Hendon and then transferred to another establishment at Ashford Kent until the first 'term' after their 18th birthday when they were attached to a Cadet Centre, there were four Cadet Centres at Kingsbry, Sunbury, Norwood and Wanstead. In 1968 the Hendon Police Cadet College opened on the corner of Aerodrome Road and Colindale Avenue almost directly opposite the gates to RAF Hendon. During 1970 RAF Hendon began to be transformed into a large Housing estate. The new building consisted of a purpose built gymnasium, four accommodation blocks and an administration / training building. There was a large parade ground for the cadets to practice their drill. Police Cadets from the Royal Ulster Constabulary and Kent Police made up part of the complement at Hendon. Until the 1990s, Police Cadets were full-time frontline employees who were aged 16-19. The Metropolitan Police Service introduced one such scheme in 1948. These Police Cadets had no powers of arrest but were able to assist their senior colleagues in many practical matters, such as taking statements, directing traffic, or offering crime prevention advice, as well as observing the work of their supervisors. This incarnation of the Police Cadets could be compared to present-day Police Community Support Officers. On reaching the age of 19, a Cadet would either apply for training as a police officer, or leave the police force. In 1980 the ITV television network aired The Squad, a drama series which followed the fictional adventures of Metropolitan Police Cadets. The twelve episodes were produced by Thames Television.See the British Film Institute website here for more details. Most of these precursor schemes were disbanded by the 1990s. The present form of Police Cadets began in 1988. It was a community initiative that was supported by Commissioner Peter Imbert, who wanted to engage with young people. The first documented Volunteer Police Cadet unit started in South Norwood (Lambeth) in March 1988. Organisation 150px All of the territorial police forces of England and Wales have a corresponding VPC branch, as does the British Transport Police. These are subdivided into local branches. There is a separate but similar scheme in Scotland called the Police Scotland Youth Volunteers, but no equivalent scheme exists in Northern Ireland. The VPC is supported by a team, led by Chief Constable Shaun Sawyer of Devon & Cornwall Police. The team have developed the National Police Chiefs' Council supported framework, sharing the common Aims and Principles of the VPC programmes operating in police forces across the UK. They support the VPC through funding; developing resources and training; producing opportunities for cadets and leaders. Sharing good practice amongst VPC members ensures police engagement and education of cadets, recognising the role of young people within their communities and policing. =Activities= Units normally meet at a local school or community venue once a week and are led by police officers, police staff and volunteers. In addition cadets develop their leadership skills by undertaking challenging social action projects in their communities with an expectation that they will volunteer 3 hours a month. Examples of these projects include supporting older members of the community understand cyber crime, fund raising for charities and road safety campaigns. Cadets learn about: * drill * citizenship * police powers & procedures * first aid VPC teams also take part in many events & activities out in their communities, such as the London Marathon, Notting Hill Carnival, Remembrance Sunday & Armed Forces Day parades. Cadets also take part in the Duke of Edinbugh's Award (DofE) and from 2019 will have the opportunity to participate in the UK Youth Achievement Awards. Police Cadets have no special powers. Unlike the previous full-time cadets, they rarely assist the police in actual policing activities, and are never sent to high-risk situations. Once they reach the age of 14, cadets may go out in public with police officers to take part in low-risk policing activities. Undercover cadets have been used to test if shops are willing to sell alcohol, tobacco and weapons to underage customers. They may also assist policing at large public events and provide crime prevention advice to local residents and businesses. =Uniform= There is no standardised uniform for the Police Cadets, with each parent Police Service providing their own uniform design. Generally, the uniforms avoid bearing too much resemblance to the uniforms of police officers, PCSOs, and other enforcement officers. They have tended to use badged polo shirts, formal uniform shirt (which could be white or blue) with epaulettes bearing VPC insignia or cadet rank bars, and a beret, peaked cap, or baseball cap. Cadets are also issued with trousers and fleece or coat. Some cadets wear black ties & wear a brassard on their right arm. Other Forces issue their VPCs with a light blue or red tie. In Cambridgeshire, cadets wear a similar uniform to the old full-time cadets, but are issued with a navy blue combat-style sweater (marked 'Police Cadet') instead of a tunic; however in Sussex their uniform is similar to a police officer's, with white shirt, tie, epaulettes, black trousers, and black shoes. They also have cadet jackets and a high visibility jacket. In Hertfordshire, cadets were issued with a light blue V-neck sweater, which had the county emblem embroidered on it. The Hertfordshire scheme has now changed and cadets wear a uniform similar to regular police officers, but with the word \\"cadet\\" embroidered on epaulette rank slides instead of a collar number and similarly the word \\"cadet\\" on the left breast reflective strip instead of the word \\"police\\". Ranks The highest rank is Head Police Cadet, with a Head Police Cadet normally having two deputies to assist them and fill in for them if necessary. A Head Police Cadet is akin to a Chief Constable in a structural sense as the Head Police Officer and is often viewed as ‚Äòthe Chief Cadet‚Äô and a potential future Chief Constable. Ranks within Volunteer Police Cadet schemes vary considerably across Great Britain. Cadets appointed Mayor's Cadets are given a special badge or epaulettes to wear. { style=\\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font- size:95%; margin:0 12px 12px 0; margin:auto; width:100%; text-align:center;\\" + class=\\"nowrap\\"  Cadet Ranks and Insignia } The epaulette is arranged in the order: * Epaulette Pin * Phonetic Code of the London Borough * V.P.C Band (light blue, placed through epaulette) * Metal Bar ( distinguishes rank ) The Volunteer Police Cadets have a few positions above the V.P.C standard ranks for people over the age of 18 such as: * V.P.C Supervisor Band ---- Over 18s who still want to assist in Cadets as Volunteer Police Cadet Leaders * V.P.C Staff Band ---- For, actively serving, Police Officers who wear the V.P.C Uniform which is fairly uncommon =Hampshire Constabulary= Hampshire Constabulary Volunteer Police Cadet programme is divided into units consisting of around thirty cadets with a head cadet, deputy head cadet and team leaders. The rank insignia is worn on epaulettes on the shirts for formal occasions or ironed onto polo shirts which are used for less formal occasions. In 2018, Hampshire, Thames Valley Police, Sussex and Surrey standardised on uniforms and rank slides, although proliferation of the new uniform has been limited within Hampshire. =Leicestershire Police= Head police cadet is the highest rank, typically assisted by two deputies. 150px =Thames Valley Police= In Thames Valley Police, the ranks are as follows: cadet, team leader, deputy head cadet, and head cadet. Branches =Scotland= The equivalent of the Police Cadets in Scotland is the Police Scotland Youth Volunteers (PSYV). The PSYV is not part of the Volunteer Police Cadets framework, but is listed as a partner agency and carries out similar work. Established in 2013 with five groups in Aberdeen, Cumnock, Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow, PSYV members volunteered at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow and other public events. The program has quickly expanded and today there are now twenty groups across Scotland from Stranraer to Shetland, with plans to expand further. =London= The founder and the largest cadet scheme are operated by the Metropolitan Police Service, with over 5,000 cadets as of March 2016. It was founded in 1988 by Commissioner Peter Imbert. By 2010, every London borough had a VPC unit, along with a central support team within the Territorial Policing Command Unit. Metropolitan Police Cadetshttp://www.met.police.uk/cadets/about_us.html are involved in continuing further education, DofE, learning about the police service, carrying out attachments to divisions and specialist departments, learning first aid, and engaging in community work projects with the disabled and disadvantaged. London Police cadets annually compete in a police scenario completion, which was traditionally held in Hendon, in North London, for the annual Police Cadet Competition. This involved cadets competing in a range of police activities and scenarios, in which they were competitively assessed. In 2015 the Metropolitan Police announced that the Cadet Competition was no longer to be held at Hendon due to the resizing of Hendon; some of the land was sold off for development. However, the Annual Cadet Competition continues a long tradition at the GRAVESEND public order site. 2013 also saw the launch of Junior Police Cadets capturing those young people from school Year 6 to Year 9 at which point they become eligible to join the senior VPC. On Sunday 14 June 2009, the Metropolitan Police Volunteer Police Cadets took part in what is believed to have been the largest ever formal parade of young people, to celebrate the 22nd anniversary of the establishment of the Volunteer Police Cadet force in what was named as the \\"colour parade\\" and was carried out on Horse Guard's Parade. Each cadet troop was formally passed a Standard (flag) under the review of the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Paul Stephenson, and other senior officers of the Metropolitan Police. The parade also included the showing of vintage police vehicles, police dogs, and a static display of the Boys' Brigade's London Massed Bugle Band. Bands that lead the four columns of a total of 1,400 cadets (and various police cadet staff, most of whom also hold different roles within the Metropolitan Police) were Metropolitan Police Pipe Band, the Nottingham-shire Police Pipe Band, the British Airways Brass Band, and the Enfield District Scout Band. In 2011, Mayor Boris Johnson supported expanding the Metropolitan Police VPC by calling for numbers to be doubled by 2015. The Metropolitan Police VPC changed the age range from 14-19 to 10-24, introducing the UK's first Junior Volunteer Police Cadets scheme. The expansion target was achieved in March 2016. =Schemes in operation= * Avon and Somerset Police * Bedfordshire Police * British Transport Police London, Birmingham and York * Cambridgeshire Police * Cheshire Police * City of London Police * Derbyshire Constabulary * Devon and Cornwall Police * Dyfed-Powys Police * Essex Police * Gloucestershire Police * Greater Manchester Police * Hampshire Constabulary * Hertfordshire Constabulary * Humberside Police * Isle of Man Police * Kent Police Seven Cadet Units - Canterbury, Dover, Maidstone, Tonbridge and Medway,Gravesend, Swanley * Lancashire Police * Leicestershire Police * Lincolnshire Police * Merseyside Police Force-wide in April 2006.

Kimchi fried rice or kimchi-bokkeum-bap () is a variety of bokkeum-bap (\\"fried rice\\"), a popular dish in South Korea. Kimchi fried rice is made primarily with kimchi and rice, along with other available ingredients, such as diced vegetables or meats like spam. Ingredients Leftover rice and/or over-ripened kimchi as ingredients are usually preferred in preparing kimchi fried rice. Over-ripened kimchi can also be used for cooking kimchi jjigae. Indeed, well-fermented kimchi and chilled rice can produce a flavor of greater richness as opposed to freshly made kimchi and rice. In preliminary preparation, as surplus \\"kimchiso\\" (hangul: ÍπÄÏπòÏÜå, kimchi filling, mostly shredded radish, green onions and jeotgal, fermented and salted seafood) taken out from kimchi, squeezed to discard its brine. Without completing the process, the resultant dish can be mushy in texture. Along with kimchi and rice, kimchi fried rice can contain many kinds of ingredients. Pork or spam are the most common; however, beef, chicken, bacon, ham, canned tuna, or shrimp can be used. Instead of meat, mushrooms can be used as a replacement, in which case the ingredient's name may be prefixed to the dish's name such as \\"beoseot-kimchi-bokkeum-bap\\" (hangul: Î≤ÑÏÑØÍπÄÏπòÎ≥∂ÏùåÎ∞•, literally \\"mushroom kimchi fried rice\\"). Meat ingredients are chopped into the dish together with vegetables such as onion, carrot or zucchini. However, ingredients depend on personal preference and occasion. A small amount of minced garlic and sliced green pepper can be used as seasoning. These ingredients are fried in a pan with a little vegetable or sesame oil. After the cooked dish is put on a plate or in a bowl, a fried egg is sometimes served on top. Thinly shredded gim, chopped scallions or sesame are spread over it to enhance the flavor and to garnish. Popularity Since kimchi fried rice is cheap and easy to make in a short period of time, it is favored by students living alone who cannot afford expensive meals. Kimchi fried rice is also a popular item for lunch at a bunsikjeom (\\"bunsik place\\"). As the dish is hot and spicy, it is typically served with danmuji and a small bowl of any kind of mild and warm soup such as miyeok-guk (\\"wakame soup\\"), or kongnamul- guk (\\"soybean sprout soup\\"). During summer, cool dongchimi (white, watery kimchi made of radish) can also be accompanied with the dish. The popularity of kimchi fried rice is also reflected in South Korean pop culture. Byun Jin- sub, a popular male singer in the late 1980s, sang a song titled \\"Wishes\\" (hangul: Ìù¨ÎßùÏÇ¨Ìï≠) in which he stated that the singer's ideal girlfriend would be one who cooks good kimchi fried rice. Taeyang says in his 2010 song \\"I Need A Girl\\" that his ideal girlfriend will eat the kimchi fried rice that he cooks.

Cabinet appointments In April 2003, Carm Mifsud Bonnici was appointed as Parliamentary Secretary in the Ministry for Justice and Home Affairs. Following the swearing-in of Lawrence Gonzi as Prime Minister and the subsequent Cabinet reshuffle in March 2004, he was re- confirmed as Parliamentary Secretary in the Ministry for Justice and Home Affairs. During this period he drove the implementation of several reforms and introduction of new concepts in the Maltese judicial system. After the March 2008 general election, Mifsud Bonnici was appointed as Minister for Justice and Home Affairs. His portfolio includes the responsibility for the Courts of Justice, the Attorney General's Office, the Police Corps, Immigration, Airport Security, Correctional Services, Civil Protection and Data Protection. In February 2009, Mifsud Bonnici unveiled the White Paper on Restorative Justice which is intended to serve as a basis for public discussion for a deep reform in Malta's penal system. It proposes the introduction of a number of new concepts, including parole, which is as yet unavailable in Malta. In January 2012 he was made Minister for Home and Parliamentary Affairs which included the role of Leader of the House of Representatives. However, he resigned as Minister the following 30 May after an Opposition motion of no confidence in him was carried, which was supported by all Labour-Parliamentarians along with Nationalist Franco Debono. Literary works Carm Mifsud Bonnici is the author of four publications: ≈ªewg Minuti Flimkien (1998), Il-Prinƒãipji Hemm Jibqgƒßu (2003), Sens u Sustanza (2008) and Il-Politika tas-Sewwa (2013).

A police pursuit of over 20 officers chased the men from the East River to Pete Williams' Slaughter House Inn where they were forced to surrender to police after a three-hour siege. Saul and Howlett were later convicted of the murder of ship watchmen Charles Baxter and sentenced to be executed.

She studied as an undergraduate and graduate student at Clare College, Cambridge and as a postgraduate student at the Royal Academy of Music. She was a Research Fellow of St John's College, Cambridge and Newnham College, Cambridge, Fellow of University College, Oxford, and has been a Fellow of Oriel College since 2000.Jesus College entry She holds a master's degree (M.A.) and doctorate (Ph.D.) from Cambridge, Dip. R.A.M., L.R.A.M., and a master's degree (M.A.) from Oxford. Academic career Her research interests lie in the study of ancient education, ethics and early Christianity and contemporary historiography. Her work encompasses aspects of the relationship between literature and society in antiquity, cultural and intellectual history and early Christian history and theology. She broadcasts regularly on radio and television and writes for The Tablet, The Church Times and The Times Literary Supplement. Morgan is Professor of Graeco-Roman History in the Faculty of Classics, University of Oxford and Nancy Bissell Turpin Fellow and Tutor in Ancient History at Oriel College, Oxford.

She is a Trustee of the Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies. =Roman Faith and Christian Faith= Roman Faith and Christian Faith (2015) is a much discussed study of how early Christians understood and practised 'faith' (pistis, fides in the languages which dominate early sources).reviews Theology 119(2) (2016); Ecclesiology 12 (2016), 354-62; BMCR 2016.06.34, Classics For All 22/6/2016; review discussions: JSNT 39.2 (2018), 112; NTS 64 (2017); Religious Studies 54 (2018) It argues that for early Christians, trust and faithfulness, rather than belief in doctrines or non-rational fideism, were salvific and central to life in a Christian community. It locates Christian understandings of pistis/fides in their context in Hellenistic Judaism and Greco-Roman society, arguing that belief and orthodoxy become central to later Christianity through contact with Greek philosophy and religion. In 2017 Morgan received a Leverhulme Major Research Fellowship to write the sequel to Roman Faith and Christian Faith, investigating the evolution of Christian faith between the second and fifth centuries CE and its impact on late Rome and her successor states. =Literate Education in the Hellenistic and Roman Worlds= Morgan's most cited book, Literate Education in the Hellenistic and Roman Worlds (1998) examines Hellenistic and Roman education and re-interprets the function of literature, grammar and rhetoric in education, as well as looking at Hellenistic and Roman theories of cognitive development.Cambridge University Press entry for Literate Education in the Hellenistic and Roman Worlds Morgan's Literate Education in the Hellenistic and Roman Worlds is on the reading lists of many university courses and modules in the UK and the United States.

More specifically it is the inadvertent creation of a low-impedance path between the power supply rails of a MOSFET circuit, triggering a parasitic structure which disrupts proper functioning of the part, possibly even leading to its destruction due to overcurrent. A power cycle is required to correct this situation. A single event latch-up is a latch-up caused by a single event upset, typically heavy ions or protons from cosmic rays or solar flares. R. Koga, K.B. Crawford, S.J. Hansel, B.M. Johnson, D.D. Lau, S.H. Penzin, S.D. Pinkerton, M.C. Maher. \\"AN-932 SEU and Latch Up Tolerant Advanced CMOS Technology\\". 1994\\\\. \\"Single-event latch-up protection of integrated circuits\\". 2002\\\\. The parasitic structure is usually equivalent to a thyristor (or SCR), a PNPN structure which acts as a PNP and an NPN transistor stacked next to each other. During a latch-up when one of the transistors is conducting, the other one begins conducting too. They both keep each other in saturation for as long as the structure is forward-biased and some current flows through it - which usually means until a power-down. The SCR parasitic structure is formed as a part of the totem-pole PMOS and NMOS transistor pair on the output drivers of the gates. The latch-up does not have to happen between the power rails - it can happen at any place where the required parasitic structure exists. A common cause of latch-up is a positive or negative voltage spike on an input or output pin of a digital chip that exceeds the rail voltage by more than a diode drop. Another cause is the supply voltage exceeding the absolute maximum rating, often from a transient spike in the power supply. It leads to a breakdown of an internal junction. This frequently happens in circuits which use multiple supply voltages that do not come up in the required sequence on power-up, leading to voltages on data lines exceeding the input rating of parts that have not yet reached a nominal supply voltage. Latch-ups can also be caused by an electrostatic discharge event. Intrinsic bipolar junction transistors in the CMOS technology Another common cause of latch-ups is ionizing radiation which makes this a significant issue in electronic products designed for space (or very high-altitude) applications. High-power microwave interference can also trigger latch ups. H. Wang, J. Li, H. Li, K. Xiao and H. Chen. \\"Experimental study and Spice simulation of CMOS inverters latch-up effects due to high power microwave interference\\". 2008\\\\. Both CMOS integrated circuits and TTL integrated circuits are more susceptible to latch-up at higher temperatures.

CMOS latch-up Equivalent circuit of CMOS latch-up All CMOS ICs have latch-up paths, but there are several design techniques that reduce susceptibility to latch-up. \\"Understanding Latch-Up in Advanced CMOS Logic\\". quote: \\"structures used in all CMOS ICs ... have latch- up paths associated with them\\" Jerry C. Whitaker. \\"Microelectronics 2nd Edition\\". 2005\\\\. p. 7-7 to 7-8. quote: \\"CMOS inverters and gates inherently have ... parasitic bipolar transistors that form a silicon controlled rectifier (SCR). Although ... latch-up cannot be avoided, CMOS manufacturers design input and output circuits that are latch-up resistant\\" Fairchild. \\"Fairchild's Process Enhancements Eliminate the CMOS SCR Latch-Up Problem In 74HC Logic\\". 1998\\\\. In CMOS technology, there are a number of intrinsic bipolar junction transistors. In CMOS processes, these transistors can create problems when the combination of n-well/p-well and substrate results in the formation of parasitic n-p-n-p structures. Triggering these thyristor-like devices leads to a shorting of the Vdd and GND lines, usually resulting in destruction of the chip, or a system failure that can only be resolved by power-down. Jan M. Rabaey, University of California,Berkeley;Anantha Chandrakasan, Massachusetts Institute of Technology,Cambridge;Borivoje Nikolic, University of California, Berkeley; Digital Integrated Circuits (2nd Edition) Consider the n-well structure in the first figure. The n-p-n-p structure is formed by the source of the NMOS, the p-substrate, the n-well and the source of the PMOS. A circuit equivalent is also shown. When one of the two bipolar transistors gets forward biased (due to current flowing through the well, or substrate), it feeds the base of the other transistor. This positive feedback increases the current until the circuit fails or burns out. The invention of the now industry-standard technique to prevent CMOS latch-up was made by Hughes Aircraft company in 1977. \\"Hughes Aircraft Patent US4173767\\".  Preventing latch-up  It is possible to design chips to be resistant to latch-up by adding a layer of insulating oxide (called a trench) that surrounds both the NMOS and the PMOS transistors. This breaks the parasitic silicon-controlled rectifier (SCR) structure between these transistors. Such parts are important in the cases where the proper sequencing of power and signals cannot be guaranteed, such as hot swap devices. Devices fabricated in lightly doped epitaxial layers grown on heavily doped substrates are also less susceptible to latch-up. The heavily doped layer acts as a current sink where excess minority carriers can quickly recombine.Stephen A. Campbell, The Science and Engineering of Microelectronic Fabrication, Oxford University Press (Indian Edition 2007) p.461 Most silicon-on-insulator devices are inherently latch-up-resistant. Latch-up is the low resistance connection between tub and power supply rails. Also to avoid the latch, a separate tap connection is put for each transistor. But this will increase the size of the device so fabs give a minimum space to put a tap, for example, 10 Œºm in 130 nm technology.

West End residents are primarily (89%) African AmericanData for Fulton County, Georgia census tracts 41 and 42 from the U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey 2017 estimates as reported by census reporter.org and the neighborhood contains several prominent African American cultural institutions, in addition to being adjacent to the Atlanta University Center complex of HBCUs. West End is located southwest of Castleberry Hill, east of Westview, west of Adair Park Historic District, and just north of Oakland City. Architectural styles within the district include Craftsman Bungalow, Queen Anne, Stick style, Folk Victorian, Colonial Revival, American Foursquare and Neoclassical Revival. History In this century, West End has endured many changes in its metamorphosis to an intown neighborhood while retaining its own distinctive character and vitality. This has been accomplished both by adaptation and participation in change and by its citizens' recognition of the district's special history. =Early history= Before there was a West End or an Atlanta, the area was a crossroads. Newnan Road connected the town of that name to Decatur and Lawrenceville. Crossing this road was the Sandtown Road going west to an Indian town of that name. Near this junction around 1830, Charner Humphries established an inn/tavern which came to be known as Whitehall due to the then unusual fact that it had a coat of white paint when most other buildings were of washed or natural wood. From a frontier outpost in the 1830s, the district evolved into an independent political entity closely linked by rail and roads to its neighbor Atlanta. in April 1871, Richard Peters and George Adair bought out the charter of the Atlanta Street Railway Company (horse-drawn) and on September 1 of that year opened the first section connecting Five Points to the West End - a route that passed by both of their homes. The following year the West End & Atlanta Street Railroad also started service to West End and Westview Cemetery. By the 1880s many wealthy Atlantans built large estates here and when they came, the main street of Gordon Street became a bustling commercial district. In 1894, it was annexed by Atlanta as a distinct ward following two decades of planned suburbanization. From 1894 to 1930, West End grew rapidly in population and prosperity. An examination of building permits for Peeples, Gordon, Lee and Lawton Streets shows a large number of single family residences being built and increasing commercial buildings and churches going up along Gordon and at the long established business district at Gordon and Lee. National and local prosperity and the mobility created by the automobile in the 1920s helped West End to grow. Approximately fifty businesses were now clustered at Gordon and Lee with branches of Sears, Firestone, Piggly-Wiggly, and Goodyear. Churches and schools increased to serve the growing population. Schools began to dot West End, the largest being the 1923 Joseph E. Brown High School at Peeples and Beecher. West End became a desirable suburban community in the 1880s, and grew rapidly in population and prosperity, so that by 1930 there were more than 22,000 residents. Notable residents in this early period included Atlanta mayor Dennis Hammond, Evan Howell, governor James Smith (1872‚Äì77), John Conley (son of Governor Benjamin Conley), Thomas Stokes (founding partner of Davison's Department Store), L. Z. Rosser (president of the Atlanta Board of Education), J. P. Allen (clothing store owner), T. D. Longino (medical doctor and alderman), J. N. McEachern (insurance executive), as well as several authors such as Frank L. Stanton, Madge Bigham and Joel Chandler Harris, known for his Uncle Remus Tales. Both during his life and up to the present, Harris has perhaps been West End's most famous resident. He attracted such figures as President Theodore Roosevelt and Andrew Carnegie to Atlanta, the former returning after Harris' death to lecture for the Uncle Remus Memorial Association. File:Bolleshome.jpg Home of George F. Bolles File:Clarkhowell.jpg Home of Clark Howell, Jr. File:Evanhowell.jpg Home of Captain Evan Howell File:Thrasherhome.jpg Home of John Thrasher =Transition= After 1930, West End was an aging but still vital Atlanta community. This vitality is most clearly evident in the West End Businessmen's Association (originally formed in 1927). In 1937, the Association pushed for extension of the National Housing Act title providing for home modernization loans, and in subsequent decades (1950s and 1960s) for economic accessibility and population stabilization, including segregation. With the group's support, Gordon Street was widened, Interstate 20 was built across West End's northern fringe, and the old business district (along with large amounts of residential housing) was demolished in favor of a mall development. Completed in 1973, the mall's accessibility was later augmented by part of the city's latest transportation system, a MARTA station, across the street. The West End Businessmen's Association obviously was successful in many areas, but it failed in stopping \\"white flight\\". By 1976, West End was eighty-six percent Afro-American. The West End is also home to the West Hunter Street Baptist Church was moved to Gordon Street. This church has been one of Atlanta's leading black churches for decades and since 1961 was led, until his death, by the Reverend Ralph David Abernathy. Jesse Jackson came to West End to speak at the opening of the new church. A close friend and confidante of Martin Luther King, Jr., Abernathy participated in most of the civil rights campaigns of the 1960s and 1970s and succeeded King as president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. In honor of his nationally recognized contributions to the civil rights movement, Gordon Street was renamed Ralph David Abernathy Boulevard, in 1991. In addition, neighborhood residents formed the West End Neighborhood Development, Inc. (WEND), in 1974, with the goal of improving the socioeconomic position of their community and its residents. In order to increase awareness of the West End neighborhood, WEND has sponsored a tour of homes, a yearly festival in Howell Park, and a driving tour booklet highlighting neighborhood homes and cultural and religious centers. Former SNCC chairman and Black Panther Party member, H. Rap Brown, relocated to the West End in the late 1970s or early 1980s. By this time, he had embraced Islam and changed his name to Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin. After joining the Muslim community in the West End (part of a national network known simply as The Community), he became known as Imam Jamil. Imam is an Arabic word referring to \\"leader\\" in Muslim communities. Imam Jamil became known for seeking to rid the neighborhood of drugs and prostitution. Today, the Muslim community maintains both a mosque and an Islamic center within walking distance of the park in the heart of the neighborhood. Though he was incarcerated in 2000, and given a life sentence, Imam Jamil's influence continues to be felt in the community. Abbas Barzegar. (July 2011).

Rap Brown) written by Maury Salakhan and published in the American Muslim online journal. =Renewal= By the 2000s, much of it still looked blighted but a few bright spots were popping up due to a wave of investment in intown Atlanta beginning to rejuvenate the area. As West End was once described as one of Atlanta's most socially diverse and culturally rich communities, it is again returning to the tradition of its past, as it relates to the regenerating of community value and revitalization. An example of revitalization in West End is Sky Lofts, which converted a long vacant Sears parking lot. Sky Lofts brought a lot of new residents, especially young professionals, looking for urban lifestyle. Historic houses are being rehabbed and renovated by new and old residents. West End, as its name suggests (named after London's theater), is also a mecca for artists. West End was chosen by Creative Loafing in 2010 as Best Neighborhood For Artists. In addition to being an artist's mecca, it is also a hub for Atlanta's Afrocentric community. Sites such as Soul Vegetarian South, the Shrine of the Black Madonna church, the Hammonds House, and the African Djeli contribute to the West End being one of the strongest hubs of African-American culture in Metro Atlanta. In last few years West End is experiencing steady influx of new residents. Neighborhood is becoming more racially diverse and new residents are very welcome by community members (post mortgage fraud). Parks and BeltLine West End is also a pioneer neighborhood for the BeltLine project in Atlanta. The first model mile was completed in the spring of 2008. The model mile consists of the biking and walking path, improvement of Gordon-White Park, and one new park behind Brown Middle School. In addition Trees Atlanta planted 200 trees native to West End which will be part of a linear arboretum that will follow the BeltLine corridor. Livable Center Initiative (LCI) granted funds for West End to renovate and improve its streetscape to make it a more walkable community. West End is included in the Peachtree Corridor plan . With the Peachtree Corridor, the BeltLine, and MARTA, West End will be one of the most transit- oriented neighborhoods Transit-oriented development in Atlanta.

Located in the Semien Gondar Zone of the Amhara Region, Metemma has a latitude and longitude of with an elevation of 685 meters above sea level. Across the border is the corresponding Sudanese village of Gallabat. According to the British diplomat Hormuzd Rassam, who travelled through Metemma in November 1865 on his diplomatic mission to Emperor Tewodros II, \\"Metemma\\" comes from the Arabic for \\"the place of cutting, or termination -- indicating the end of the Muslim provinces\\", although at the time the settlement was better known as Suk ul-Gallabat (\\"The market of Gallabat\\").Hormuzd Rassam, Narrative of the British Mission to Theodore of Abyssinia (London, 1869), vol. 1, p. 158 Metemma hosts an airport, (ICAO code HAMM, IATA ETE).  History  The town traces its origins to the 18th century, when a colony of Tukrir from Darfur finding the spot a convenient resting-place for their fellow-pilgrims on their way to Mecca and back, obtained permission from the Emperor of Ethiopia to make a permanent settlement there.\\"Local History in Ethiopia\\" The Nordic Africa Institute website (accessed 27 December 2007) However Hormuz Rassam records a different account, stating \\"within the last century\\" (i.e., the 18th century) the rulers of Metemma were in constant war with their counterparts at Er-Rashid and manned their armies with slaves taken from Kurdufan and Darfur. These foreign conscripts eventually revolted and killed the \\"so-called Arab chief\\", making one of their number ruler. Lying on the main trade route from Sennar to Gondar (some 90 miles to the east by south), Metemma/Gallabat grew into a trade center of some importance. The Scottish explorer James Bruce (who called the town Hor-Cacamoot) travelled through the town in 1772. This location not only made the settlement a major marketplace, but also a major slave market in the 19th century. Richard Pankhurst has published estimates of the number of people sold in this market during the 19th century that range between 10,000 and 20,000. By 1881, European visitors reported that the Emperor Yohannes IV had ordered the slave market closed.Pankhurst, p. 98 Emperor Yohannes was killed in battle nearby on 9‚Äì10 March 1889 fighting the Sudenese Mahdist in the Battle of Gallabat.Seri-Hersch, Iris, ¬´Confronting a Christian Neighbor: Sudanese Representations of Ethiopia in the Early Mahdist Period, 1885-1889¬ª, International Journal of Middle East Studies, vol. 41(2), 2009, p. 247-267, on line. An Italian column from Gadabi occupied Metemma on 12 April 1936, which consisted of one Eritrean battalion, one squadron mounted on camels, and 1 platoon of light tanks. During the occupation, the Italians built a mosque in the town. After war was declared between the British and Italian Empires, the Italians crossed the border and occupied Gallabat. But the British recaptured the town 6 November 1940 with the intent of then capturing Metemma; however, the attack on Metemma failed miserably and the British were forced to evacuate Gallabat again. They occupied Metemma for good 19 January 1941.Anthony Mockler, Haile Selassie's War (New York: Olive Branch Press, 2003), pp. 272-279 The trade route through Metemma remained important up to the beginning of the 20th century, but the introduction of rail transport to Sudan, as well as improvements to the roads inside Ethiopia robbed the town of its importance, until by E.C. 1944 (AD 1952) an official survey found only 129 thatched and corrugated-roof houses in Matemma, of which \\"fourteen were government properties, three were owned by nagades and twelve were empty -- probably reserved for renting.\\"The survey of the housing in Metemma was dated Ginbot 19, which falls in late May. Solomon Getamun, History of the City of Gondar (Africa World Press, 2005), pp. 100f. During the Ethiopian Civil War, Metemma was captured by the Ethiopian Democratic Union (EDU) on 13 January 1977, who attacked from positions inside Sudan.Andargachew Tiruneh, The Ethiopian revolution, 1974-1987 (Cambridge: University Press, 1993), p. 207 The town was taken from the EDU by the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front 7 October 1990, claiming to have killed 28 of its enemy forces, wounded 21, and captured 16. A road to Al Qadarif of good standard was completed mid-March 2002, allowing import and export goods to be sent through Port Sudan, where an area had been reserved for Ethiopian goods and containers.  Demographics  Based on figures from the Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia published in 2005, Metemma has an estimated total population of 5,581, with 3,132 males and 2,449 females.CSA 2005 National Statistics , Table B.3 The 1994 census reported this town had a total population of 3,183 of whom 1,648 were males and 1,535 were females.

Earth and Jupiter are off-limits to humanity, but Earth's moon and the other worlds and moons of the solar system have all become heavily populated. There are also minor colonies set in the Oort cloud at the edge of the solar system. Faster than light travel is not (as yet) possible, though it's mentioned that test- flights will begin soon at the end of The Golden Globe, and the species has not as yet managed to extend itself to other stars. The series mostly deals with the ways in which technology and necessity shape morality and society. Instant sex changes are considered a matter of fashion, rather than gender- identity, and many long-standing human sexual taboos no longer exist. The Eight Worlds story \\"Overdrawn at the Memory Bank\\", published in 1976, was adapted into a TV movie in 1985 starring Raul Julia. The stories were written at different times and are not always consistent with each other. In particular, the novels Steel Beach and The Golden Globe are explicitly stated as being inconsistent with the original history (see Consistency, below). Varley has written that the Eight Worlds background should be regarded as a group of common characters and situations that appear in different stories rather than a single consistent setting. Several of the stories feature common characters, and these may be seen as linking together the whole series. Common characters =Pre-Invasion= For many years the \\"Pre-invasion\\" stories weren't clearly in the Eight Worlds sequence, since while sharing thematic elements with the Eight Worlds universe they didn't share characters or locations. This uncertainty was put to rest in 2019 with the publication of Irontown Blues, which featured Chris Bach, the son of Anna Louise Bach, as its main character. Anna Louise Bach The first Anna Louise Bach detective story is the short story \\"Bagatelle\\" concerning a nuclear device planted in an underground lunar colony. At this time, Earth is still home to a technological civilization, albeit one which has to deal with nuclear terrorism. Bach is the Chief of Police in Luna City. Later stories such as \\"The Barbie Murders\\", and \\"Tango Charlie and Foxtrot Romeo\\" deal with Bach in the earlier stages of her career. The novelette \\"Blue Champagne\\" has Bach as a minor character, working as a lifeguard in \\"The Bubble\\", a giant globe of water held in zero-gravity conditions on a resort satellite for the enjoyment of rich tourists. At the end of that story she announces that she has been saving her money to return to Luna and enroll in the Police Academy. A major character in the same story is Megan Galloway, a \\"media star\\" who seduces, and later falls in love with, \\"Q.M.\\" Cooper, a former champion swimmer on Earth and Anna's occasional lover. A feature of the Anna Louise stories is her taste for \\"beefcake\\", or very masculine, muscular men. In notes contained within The John Varley Reader, the author explains that he created Anna Louise Bach for stories which were too grim for the relative Utopia of the Eight Worlds series. He never intended that her story link to the Eight Worlds chronology. In fact, even within the Anna Louise Bach stories there are inconsistencies, such as the appearance of the fabulous \\"Mozartplatz\\" in \\"Tango Charlie and Foxtrot Romeo\\", where a huge chasm on Luna is roofed over producing cubic miles of pressurized space featuring aerial communities, artificial rivers etc. The other stories portray Luna society as living in cramped tunnels, although \\"Bagatelle\\" does take place partially on a golf course in a large cavern. Megan Galloway Megan Galloway first appears in \\"Blue Champagne\\" and then in \\"Tango Charlie and Foxtrot Romeo\\", linking her with Anna Louise Bach in both. In \\"Blue Champagne\\" she is a \\"trans-sister\\", a quadraplegic who leads a celebrity lifestyle with the aid of a sophisticated device that enfolds her entire body in a net of golden alloy threads, which move her limbs for her. The device also records sights, sounds and emotions as she experiences them. These are then sold as virtual reality experiences, known as feelies, for an audience of vicarious thrill-seekers. The income is needed to support the huge expense of renting the device. Her magnum opus is \\"Love\\", the feeling of falling in love, which she experienced with Q.M. Cooper. The selling of that feelie creates a rift between her and Cooper, resulting in him retreating to a commune. In Steel Beach she is also mentioned as one of the \\"Gigastars\\" enshrined by the Flacks - a bizarre celebrity cult - who later regret this choice, when feelies go out of fashion. In \\"Tango Charlie\\" she has shed the device, undergone surgery to restore her nervous system, and uses her money and influence to help Anna Louise Bach with her stuttering career and her current case. She mysteriously disappears 100 years before the action of \\"Steel Beach\\". =Post- Invasion= The story \\"Options\\" explores the issue of easy sex changes from male to female and back. A married woman, Cleo, living in King City, undergoes a change to male despite her husband's objections. As \\"Leo\\" she finds out what it means to be a man in her society and even becomes her husband's best friend. She also learns that people are adopting new names that are historically neither male nor female. She eventually returns to female as \\"Nile\\". The names of characters in other Post-Invasion stories reflect this social change. Fox and Argus Characters with these names appear in \\"The Phantom of Kansas\\", \\"Picnic on Nearside\\" and Steel Beach. It is by no means clear that they are the same people except in the first two, where Fox's mother's name is Carnival. Fox encounters her own clone in \\"Phantom\\", illegally made in a strange form of kidnapping. They discover a mutual affection and leave Luna as a couple for somewhere with less restrictive laws. Cathay Cathay, a Teacher, appears in the short story \\"Beatnik Bayou\\" and The Ophiuchi Hotline. His job entails working exclusively with one child for an extended period of his or her early life. In \\"Beatnik Bayou\\" he actually regresses physically to the age of the child and grows up at the same rate, keeping his adult mentality, but an incident results in him being professionally disgraced. In The Ophiuchi Hotline he is cloned illegally by the character \\"Boss Tweed\\", so that two of him are major characters in that novel. Parameter/Equinox/Solstice Parameter is a woman who, after a life of debauchery fueled by inherited money, tries the only untried experience left, that of half of a symbiotic pair living among the rings of Saturn, as described in the story \\"Equinoctial\\". Her first pairing ends when she is captured by religious fanatics who kidnap her newborn children to raise in their religion. Her symb partner, who took the name \\"Equinox\\", is killed, which almost drives Parameter insane. Offered another partner, she reluctantly accepts. The new symb takes the name \\"Solstice\\". The two are eventually reunited with her children. In The Ophiuchi Hotline she helps Lilo hide a cloned body in a capsule orbiting Saturn. Hildy Johnson A journalist who was born Maria Cabrini, then used the name Mario after her first Change, but eventually took a new name from The Front Page. Hildy is the central character in Steel Beach and has appeared as a minor character in other works. Sparky Valentine Actor and con-man. The main character of The Golden Globe. =Groups and Organizations= The Invaders Described at length in The Ophiuchi Hotline, the Invaders are inhabitants of gas-giant planets like Jupiter. They transcend the limits of four-dimensional spacetime and can manipulate time and space at will. They classify living beings in one of three categories: those such as themselves, who arise in gas giant planets everywhere, cetaceans such as dolphins and whales, and vermin, the last category including all sentient beings other than Invaders and cetaceans. The Invasion of Earth was carried out to protect cetaceans from the effects of human civilization. Although no humans were directly killed, billions died as the Invaders dismantled all the infrastructure needed to support human civilization on Earth. The human population remaining on Earth after the Invasion is about the same as in prehistory, living in tribes without access to technology. This is a scenario that has been played out for millions of years across the galaxy. Inevitably the human species will be forced out of the Solar System altogether, to live between the stars where other displaced intelligences are already in residence. Free Earthers A result of the invasion and conquest of Earth is the polarizing of human politics in the remaining human worlds between the Free Earther Party and its opponents (who don't seem to have a specific name). Free Earthers are intransigently unreconciled to the loss of Humanity's original world and are committed to continued resistance to the invaders and eventual liberation of Earth. Boss Tweed, the main villain of The Ophiuchi Hotline, is an outspoken Free Earther - though in his case it is difficult to distinguish where commitment to the Free Earth cause ends and a simple lust for power begins. The Free Earthers' more pragmatic opponents point out that humanity has not found any effective means of opposing the Invaders' overwhelming four-dimensional weapons - or even understanding how they work; that Humanity is doing quite well on the remaining Eight Worlds; and that provoking the Invaders would not free the Earth but might endanger what humans still have. Ultimately, these cautions prove to have been completely justified; the Free Earthers' attempt to attack Jupiter does no real harm to the Invaders (as far as humans can see) but does provoke them into destroying the Eight Worlds and altogether expelling humans from the Solar System. As is eventually disclosed, this outcome was virtually inevitable. In every system which was invaded before and where the hitherto dominant species was driven off its home world in order to protect that world's Cetaceans, there always develops an intransigent faction seeking to liberate the home planet, and its actions always ultimately cause the Invaders to drive the species altogether out of its original system. Since it already happened so many times before, presumably the Invaders in Humanity's Solar System anticipated it from the start and were patiently waiting for the Free Earthers to provide them with a pretext - though Humanity remains almost completely ignorant of who the Invaders truly are and how their minds work. Heinleiners The novel Steel Beach introduces the \\"Heinleiners,\\" a group of idealists and freethinkers attempting to build a starship while following a kind of extreme libertarianism. New technologies such the \\"null field\\" and a \\"FTL propulsion system\\" are ascribed to them, rather than coming from the Ophiuchi Hotline as per earlier stories. The group's name is an homage to Robert A. Heinlein. Their primary inventor and \\"leader\\" uses the pseudonym \\"Valentine Michael Smith\\", an homage to Heinlein's novel Stranger in a Strange Land. Hildy's discussions with Smith are usually a give-and-take discussion of the costs and benefits of their philosophy versus the minimalist autocracy of how the Central Computer runs Luna, with neither side being idealized. The Heinleiners are referenced by Sparky Valentine in The Golden Globe but do not appear. Common locations =King City= Apparently a settlement on the far side of Luna from Earth, it features in several stories, including \\"Options\\", a story about the early days when people can change sex at will. In \\"Picnic on Nearside\\" two adolescents leave King City to explore the old cities on the other side of Luna, from which Earth can be seen all the time. These were abandoned after the Invasion, as people did not like to look at what they had lost. =\\"disneylands\\"= These are vast caverns designed as resorts or simulations of places on Earth. In \\"The Phantom of Kansas\\" the character Fox arranges weather sculptures in the eponymous disneyland, coordinating lightning strikes and tornadoes in a gigantic light show. In \\"Beatnik Bayou\\" there is a smaller disneyland simulating 1930's Louisiana (with an anachronistic Toyota truck). The story \\"Goodbye Robinson Crusoe\\" takes place in a similar partly-finished construction on Pluto. Technologies Humans possess several advanced technologies, many supposedly derived from information contained in the \\"Ophiuchi Hotline\\", a stream of data travelling on a laser beam, apparently from the star 70 Ophiuchi. The novel Steel Beach describes new technologies: the \\"null field\\" and a \\"FTL propulsion system\\". These are attributed to \\"Valentine Michael Smith\\", the \\"leader\\" of a group of idealists known as the \\"Heinleiners\\", and whose pseudonym is an homage to Heinlein and his novel Stranger in a Strange Land. =Nullfield= A variant on the \\"force field\\" idea, the nullfield can wrap any object or volume in a shell which cannot be penetrated by anything, except gravity and certain kinds of light. Worn like a second skin, it is the ultimate spacesuit. It can also be a domed tent for life on the surface of Luna, Mercury or Venus. To someone outside, a nullfield looks like a perfect mirror in the shape of whatever it contains. In the stories, people in nullfield suits survive falling into Jupiter, skimming the outer atmosphere of the Sun, walking on the surface of Venus, and being buried alive on Mercury (though the kinetic energy of being shot can cause fatal heat buildup). Two nullfields can merge, allowing people wearing them to touch each other, making for a way of passing the time when buried alive, waiting to be rescued. A nullfield can also be used as a doorway between pressurized quarters and vacuum. A person with a personal suit generator can walk through the nullfield doorway from air to vacuum, and their suit will form automatically. =Symbiotic spacesuits= Usually called \\"Symbs\\", these are a semi-living material which can supply all the needs of a human body, requiring only sunlight and some trace elements. A Symb will enfold and penetrate the body of someone who wants to enter into symbiosis with it, forming a Symb Pair. One of the side effects is that the Symb forms a personality of its own in the brain of the human. It also vastly increases the efficiency of the brain, and enhances artistic abilities. Almost all Symb Pairs live in the rings of Saturn, trading artworks for their few material needs. Symbs appear in the novel The Ophiuchi Hotline and the short stories \\"Gotta Sing, Gotta Dance\\" and \\"Equinoctial\\". In \\"Equinoctial\\" two factions of Symb Pairs are engaged in a Holy War. One faction is intent on coloring the second (\\"B\\") ring of Saturn red using genetically engineered bacteria, as a kind of cosmic statement. The other faction intend to prevent this and reverse any coloring they find. Both sides are deadly serious in this, the one considering the coloring of the rings a Holy Mission fully worth the devotion of one's life and justifying the killing of anyone interfering with this task; the other faction is equally sure that coloring the rings is a Sacrilege grave enough to kill those involved in it and to devote one's life to reversing it. The struggle is expected to last for millennia as each side tries to out-populate the other, often by kidnapping each other's children - and it seems the rest of the Eight Worlds are content to let them continue their war, no one trying to stop it and make peace. A third faction lives in the outer \\"A\\" ring and takes no part in the war, preferring to produce art to sell as needed. Although Saturn is a gas giant like Jupiter, the Invaders clearly have no interest in it, or any human activity in its vicinity. In The Ophiuchi Hotline it is revealed that the Symbs are a trojan horse of sorts. If the demands of the Hotline operators are not met, the Symb Pairs will transform into unstoppable warriors capable of destroying all human space habitats. However the demands consist only of allowing alien minds to assimilate human culture by riding along in the minds of selected people. =Genetic manipulation= Oddly, the creators of the Hotline data seem to know a lot about genetics. Humans in the Eight Worlds use this information to create new animal and plant species, but manipulating human DNA is illegal. This is an important plot point in the final episode of the series The Ophiuchi Hotline. Minor modifications of the body are routine, such as the addition of gills for underwater breathing (Goodbye, Robinson Crusoe) or decorative alterations, such as growing fur on various parts of the body. A popular modification consists of replacing feet with grasping hand-like structures called \\"peds\\", which are especially useful in microgravity. In The Ophiuchi Hotline a character known as \\"Javelin\\" takes modification to extremes by having only one arm and one leg, with a \\"ped\\", at opposite corners of a slim body. Other characters dispense with legs altogether for life in space. =Personality recording= Using a fictional chemical called ferrophotonucleic acid, or FPNA, the state of a person's brain can be preserved in long molecular chains, and replayed into a new brain. This is used for two purposes. First, people can record their personalities and all their memories into storage, along with a sample of their tissue. If they die, a copy can be cloned and returned to life with the memories they had up to the time of recording. This is a plot point in \\"The Phantom of Kansas\\" where the character Fox awakes to find she is a clone who has been revived after her original self, and the subsequent clone, were both mysteriously murdered. In The Ophiuchi Hotline the character Lilo is cloned several times by the politician Boss Tweed to carry out missions for him, as are several other characters. The law also provides for a sentence of \\"Death with immediate reprieve\\" where a criminal is killed and a clone is revived with memories from before the commission of the crime. The \\"innocent\\" copy has to undergo therapy to avoid a repeat of the criminal act. This sentence can even be applied to simple assault, as in \\"Beatnik Bayou\\", if the crime is severe enough. The other use is a kind of tourism where the personality can be transferred into some other brain to absorb some experience, followed by re-playing that into the original brain. In the story \\"Overdrawn at the Memory Bank\\" a man's personality is recorded and placed in the brain of a lioness in one of the wildlife reserves on Luna. Unfortunately his body goes missing, and he spends a long time in the computer network, keeping his \\"new\\" memories alive. In the process he goes to virtual university and also threatens the financial stability of the society when he starts tinkering. After what seems like months to him, he is reunited with his body and finds that only a few hours have passed. =Black holes= Black holes are a major source of energy for the Eight Worlds' society. They are quite rare but can be found - if one is persistent enough and lucky - in the space beyond Pluto. A single black hole, when dragged back into the system and installed in a power station, would be enough for a prospector to live in wealth for the rest of his or her life. Such prospectors - the successors of historical gold prospectors - spend up to twenty years at a time in solitary voyages, constantly keeping an eye on their mass detector and hoping for the one great strike which would make their fortune. Hole hunters tend to be greedy, self-centered and self-sufficient. When more than one happens to discover the same hole, one of them tends to have \\"an accident\\", far away from any kind of law and order and into which the authorities don't inquire too closely. The propulsion jets used by the prospectors' ships can be made into deadly weapons, able to vaporize a rival's ship in a split second. As recounted in \\"Lollipop and the Tar Baby\\", there is an additional complicating factor which humans are unaware of - i.e. the black holes (or at least some of them) are sentient beings, highly intelligent, with enormous knowledge gathered during millions of years of life, and who don't at all like the idea of being trapped inside a human power station. From intercepted radio signals they can and do study humans and gain detailed knowledge of their society, law and technology. The holes can communicate with humans at will and are able to manipulate them. At the same time, such intelligent black holes in no way share human values and human morality; to them, human beings and human ships, like any other kind of matter, are simply food. The black holes have no interest in humans knowing any of that, and some of the \\"accidents\\" afflicting hole hunters are due to them rather than to human rivals. The protagonist of \\"Tar Baby\\", who discovers it and survives, has very good reasons to keep the knowledge to herself and avoid drawing attention to what she had been doing in the far reaches of space. = Singularity = At the end of The Ophiuchi Hotline one of the characters is translated by the Invaders from the far future of Earth to the source of the Hotline, where other characters have arrived by ship. She arrives holding something inside a \\"nullfield\\". The aliens who run the Hotline recognize this as a singularity that can be used to nullify mass and momentum, providing the means to create a faster than light drive. At some point in their occupation of a system the Invaders allow the races they displace to obtain a singularity. This is usually followed by the extermination of those who do not leave the system. Consistency In the Author's Note of Steel Beach, Varley states: > This story appears to be part of a future history of mine, often called the > Eight Worlds. It does share background, characters, and technology with > earlier stories of mine... What it doesn't share is a chronology. The reason > for this is simple: the thought of going back, rereading all those old > stories, and putting them in coherent order filled me with ennui... Steel > Beach is not really part of the Eight Worlds future history. Or the Eight > Worlds is not really a future history, since that implies an orderly > progression of events. Take your pick. While there are small details throughout the series which do not match up, this is especially true of Steel Beach and its sequel. Any plot/character descriptions in this article should be read with this in mind.

Ayax was born in Jinotega, Nicaragua, July 14, 1941, and was murdered September 5, 1960. He had one brother, Ruy Delgado Lopez, born in Managua, Nicaragua, June 22, 1949, and five sisters. At a very young age, he became a student activist against the Somoza regime. Ayax also spent a year in Oxford. His father was a former member of the National Guard trained by the United States Marines during the Sandino period. Around the time when Anastasio Somoza Garc√≠a seized power of the National Guard, Ayax's father, Santiago Delgado, conspired with his brother, Edmundo Delgado, and Abelardo Cuadra, among other National Guard members, to overthrow Somoza from power. The plot was discovered and the Delgado brothers and the other conspirators were thrown in jail under threat of execution. Somoza later released the conspirators, but from that moment on all the conspirators became permanent enemies of the regime and were under constant surveillance. Many of them went into exile to avoid the threats and harassment from the Somoza regime. Ayax Delgado was captured after participating in \\"illegal\\" demonstrations, but he was also implicated in a bombing that claimed the life of a watchman guarding \\"Casa Pellas\\", a business of a renowned Managua businessman. Santiago Delgado (who recently died at the age of 96) begged Somoza to let his son go, Somoza promised him that nothing was going to happen to his son, and that he would indeed release him. Instead, Somoza ordered a plot to entice Ayax to escape using an opening in the ceiling of his cell, which he did. It was a dark night and a guard posted on the rooftop was ordered to shoot Ayax as an opportunity presented itself to do so. As Ayax looked for a way off the roof onto the street, the guard shot Ayax in the face. The bullet entered his face through one eye. As this was an explosive round, the back of his head was blown into pieces. Years later, someone testified that guard that killed Ayax told him that when he confronted ayax in the rooftop of the prison, he said to him: \\"Asi te queria agarrar, Chelito\\" ( that's how I wanted to get you, blondie), referring to his white skin and blond hair. Ayax died instantly. Ayax Delgado was 17 years old when he was imprisoned and reached his 18th birthday while in jail. His body was then put in a bag and thrown on top of a military vehicle and later dumped in the street where his parents lived. His family was expecting his release but was choked to find out that Ayax had actually died while \\"escaping\\" from prison. The guard later died in a \\"bar brawl\\". During the Sandinista revolution, Ayax Delgado was considered a martyr. In Managua, the capital of Nicaragua, there is a police station and a gymnasium run by the government that bear his name. Ayax Delgado was a typical member of the several student organizations opposing the Somoza regime. Many of these students came from middle- and upper-middle-class families. Many of them were killed or tortured under Somoza's repressive government.

() or simply Rog is a karstified plateau in the Koƒçevje Highlands above the ƒårmo≈°njice Valley in southeastern Slovenia. The plateau is part of the traditional Lower Carniola region of Slovenia and of the Dinaric Alps. The highest area is the central part, with the 1099-metre-high peak of Veliki Rog. The plateau is densely forested. The only ski slope in Lower Carniola, Rog- ƒårmo≈°njice (or Gaƒçe) also lies in the vicinity of Rog. The Gottscheers This area, known in German as Gottschee, was settled in the late 14th century by the Carinthian Counts of Ortenburg initially with colonists from the Ortenburg estates in Carinthia and Tyrol, and by other settlers who came from Austrian and German Dioceses of Salzburg, Brixen and Freising. The settlers cleared the vacant and heavily forested land, and established towns and rural villages. The area of Carniola that was to become Gottschee had been a strategic part of the Holy Roman Empire since the year 800. As a result, there were a number of important fortifications in and around Gottschee, which received its municipal charter and city seal in 1471. The Gottschee ethnic and linguistic area consisted of more than 180 villages organized into 31 townships and parishes. Gottscheer began to emigrate from their homeland around 1870, with most going to the United States. With the end of the Habsburg Monarchy in 1918, Gottschee became a part of the new Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Thus, the Gottscheer went from being part of the ruling ethnicity of Austria-Hungary (and the ruling group in the estates of the province of Carniola itself) to an ethnic minority in a large Slavic state. The Gottscheer 1935-1945 While some Gottscheer community leaders had embraced Nazism and agitated for \\"assistance\\" and \\"repatriation\\" to the Reich before the Wehrmacht invasion in 1941, most Gottscheer had no interest in reuniting with Greater Germany or joining the Nazis. They had been integrated into society with their Slovenian neighbors, often intermarrying among Slovenians and becoming bilingual while maintaining their Germanic language and customs since their arrival in the region in the late 14th century. However, propaganda and Nazi ideology prevailed, and following an agreement between Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler, the VoMi began planning the Gottschee \\"resettlement\\" (forced expulsion) from the Italian occupation zone to the Rann Triangle (), a region in Lower Styria between the confluences of the Krka, Sotla, and Sava rivers. To achieve that goal, accommodation had to be made for the Gottschee \\"settlers\\" and some 46,000 Slovenians in the Rann Triangle region were forcibly deported to eastern Germany for potential Germanisation or forced labor beginning in November 1941. Shortly before that time, a largely transparent propaganda effort was aimed toward both the Gottscheer and the Slovenians, promising the latter equivalent farmland in Germany for the land relinquished in Lower Styria. The Gottscheer were given Reich passports and transportation to the Rann area just after the forced departure of the Slovenians. Most of the Gottschee fled due to coercion and threats since the VoMi had a deadline of 31 December 1941 for the mass movement of both groups. Though many Gottscheer did receive farmland and households, these were of lesser quality than their own, and many were in disarray from the hasty forced expulsion of the Slovenians. From the time of their arrival to the end of the war, Gottschee farmers were harassed and sometimes killed by Tito's Partisans. The attempt to resettle the Gottscheer was a costly failure for the Nazi regime, since extra manpower was required to protect the farmers from the partisans. In 1945 the Gottscheer mostly fled to Austria and Germany. Most Gottschee were as much victims as the Slovenians deported to the Reich, though the former were not used for forced labor as the latter were. The deported Slovenians were taken to several camps in Saxony, Silesia, and elsewhere in Germany where they were forced to work on German farms or in factories run by German industries from 1941-45. The forced laborers were not always kept in formal concentration camps, but often just vacant buildings where they slept until the next day's labor took them outside these quarters. Toward the close of the war, these camps were liberated by American and Soviet troops, and the later repatriated Slovenian refugees returned to Yugoslavia to find their homes in shambles. Since then, the Rog area has been largely uninhabited. World War II Yugoslavia was invaded by the Wehrmacht on 6 April 1941, and groups of Partisans began to gather in Koƒçevski Rog as early as August 1941. From May 1942 on, large areas of liberated territory were established in the Lower Carniola, the Inner Carniola and the White Carniola, with Koƒçevski Rog as the centre of resistance to the occupation and home to the leadership of the Liberation Front of the Slovenian People. Following an Italian offensive in the summer of 1942, the leaders fled to forested hills above Polhov Gradec, where they decided that Rog would be the location of Partisan hospitals, workshops, schools printing houses and stores. The leadership returned to Rog on 17 April 1943, setting up a major facility with associated barracks called Baza 20 (Base 20),Dolenjski muzej, burger.si; accessed 17 April 2018. which is still preserved and today is a tourist attraction. It became the headquarters of the Liberation Front of the Slovenian People, the headquarters of the High Command of Slovene Partisan troops and of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Slovenia (CK KPS). World War II aftermath Koƒçevski Rog was also a location where thousands of people, such as the Slovene Home Guard () and their families, were executed by special units of the Yugoslav Army in late May 1945.European Public Hearing on ‚ÄúCrimes Committed by Totalitarian Regimes\\" Ref: Milko Mikola Crimes Committed by Totalitarian Regimes.

Frithiof's Saga () is a legendary saga from Iceland which in its present form is from ca. 1300. It is a continuation from The Saga of Thorstein V√≠kingsson (√ûorsteins saga V√≠kingssonar). It takes place principally in Norway during the 8th century.Fridtjofs saga (Store norske leksikon) Synopsis Ingeborg Peter Nicolai Arbo King Beli of Sogn (a traditional district in Western Norway) had two sons and a daughter named Ingeborg. Helgi was his first son, and Halfdan his second. On the other side of the fjord, lived the king's friend Thorstein (√ûorsteinn V√≠kingsson) whose son Frithjof (Fri√∞√æj√≥fr) was called the bold (hinn fr≈ìkni). Frithiof was the tallest, strongest and he was the bravest among men. When the king's children were but young their mother died. A goodman of Sogn named Hilding (Hildingr), prayed to have the king's daughter to foster. Frithjof was the foster-brother to the king's daughter as he was also raised together with Ingeborg (Ingibj√∂rg) by their foster-father Hilding. Both Beli and √ûorsteinn died in war whereupon Helgi and Halfdan took over the kingdom. The two kings were jealous of Frithjof's excellent qualities and so they denied him Ingeborg's hand. They took her to Baldr's sacred enclosure Baldrshagi where no one dared hurt another and where no woman and man had intercourse. Still Frithjof visited Ingeborg and they continued to love each other. This caused Helgi and Halfdan to send Frithjof away to Orkney to take tribute and while he was away they burnt down his homestead and married Ingeborg to King Ring, the aged king of Ringerike. When Frithjof returned with the tribute, he burnt down Baldr's temple in Baldrshagi and went away to live as a Viking. After three years, he came to King Ring and spent the winter with him. Just before the old king died, Frithjof's identity was apparent to everybody and so the dying king appointed Frithjof earl and made him the care-taker of Ring's and Ingeborg's child. When Ring had died, Frithjof and Ingeborg married and he became the king of Ringerike. Then he declared war on Ingeborg's brothers, killed one of them and made the second one his vassal. Frithiof's Saga in translation Frithiof's Saga had first been translated into Swedish in 1737. In 1820, Swedish writer Esaias Tegn√©r published a partial paraphrase in form of epic poetry in Iduna, the journal of the Geatish Society. In 1822, he composed five more cantos. In 1825 he published the entire poem Frithiof's Saga. Even before it was completed, it was famous throughout Europe; the aged Johann Wolfgang von Goethe took up his pen to commend to his countrymen this alte, kraftige, gigantischbarbarische Dichtart (\\"old, mighty, gigantic-barbaric style of verse\\"), and desired Amalie von Imhoff to translate it into German. This romantic paraphrase of an ancient saga was composed in twenty-four cantos, all using different poetic forms. Statue of Fridtjof Statue of Fridtjof Max Unger (1913) Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany had a statue of Fridtjof raised in the village of Vangsnes in Vik in the county of Sogn og Fjordane, Norway. The Statue of Fridtjof (Fridtjof den fr√∏kne) is a landmark which towers 22.5 metres (74 ft) over the hilltop. It stands in a park overlooking the Sognefjord. The statue was sculpted by the German sculptor and art professor Max Unger (1854-1918) and was erected in July 1913.Fridtjofstatuen (NRK Sogn og Fjordane) Wilhelm II also ordered in 1890 that a coastal defense ship be named after the Norse hero.Gr√∂ner, p. 10 Frithiof's Saga in music Frithjof's Saga was used as an inspiration by several composers. Examples include: * Max Bruch's cantata Frithjof, opus 23, from 1864 ‚Äì the first musical piece dedicated to the saga. * The symphonic poem Frithjof (cataloged as his WoO 7) by Felix Draeseke.

It was never performed. * Swedish composer Elfrida Andr√©e wrote an opera to a libretto by Selma Lagerl√∂f based on the poem, also called Frithjof's Saga; it was never performed publicly, but selections from the opera received a private hearing in 1898. In the manuscript score of the work, two arias and a chorus are translated into German, suggesting that Andr√©e may have sought their performance for a German audience. Andr√©e reworked music from the opera into a five-movement suite, Fritiov-svit that has seen performance as recently as 1995 in Sweden and was recorded on CD.

Set in Haiti under the rule of Fran√ßois \\"Papa Doc\\" Duvalier and his secret police, the Tontons Macoutes, the novel explores political repression and terrorism through the figure of an English hotel owner, Brown. The story begins as three men, Brown, Smith, an \\"innocent\\" American, and Major H. O. Jones, a confidence man, meet on a ship bound for Haiti. Brown, Smith, and Jones, their names suggesting a curious facelessness, are the \\"comedians\\" of Greene's title. Complications include Brown's friendship with a rebel leader, politically charged hotel guests and an affair with Martha Pineda, the wife of a South American ambassador. The setting for much of the novel, the Hotel Trianon, was inspired by the Hotel Oloffson in central Port-au-Prince. The novel was adapted as a feature film of the same name, released in 1967 and starring Richard Burton, Elizabeth Taylor, Alec Guinness, Peter Ustinov, James Earl Jones, Cicely Tyson, Paul Ford and Lillian Gish. Plot summary The main characters travel to Haiti on the Medea, a Dutch ship serving the capital Port-au-Prince and the Dominican Republic. The narrator is Mr. Brown, returning from an unsuccessful trip to the United States to sell his hotel, located in the capital. Other figures are Mr. Smith, a US Presidential candidate who ran on the vegetarian ticket in the 1948 United States presidential election; he and Mrs. Smith plan to build and operate a vegetarian centre in Haiti. \\"Major\\" Jones, an Anglo-Indian businessman, is personable and has many war stories that are not quite believable. Brown returns to his hotel, where he finds that government minister Philipot has committed suicide in his pool. He had apparently become a target of the government. Brown has to dispose of the body to avoid being implicated. Meanwhile, Jones is arrested as soon as he sets foot on Haitian soil. Brown convinces Mr. Smith to use his 'political weight' to help Jones get out of prison. With only the help of a pen and some paper, Jones is able to forge his way into the Haitian government. The body of Secretary Philipot is found and his family tries to hold a funeral. The president's death squad, the Tontons Macoutes, ambush the procession and steal the body. Philipot's nephew decides to join the rebel forces, and first is required to take part in a voodoo initiation ceremony. Brown reunites with his lover, Martha Pineda, wife of the Uruguayan ambassador. She is still unwilling to leave her husband and child. Realizing they can't pursue their dream in Haiti, Mr. and Mrs. Smith leave for the neighbouring Dominican Republic. Jones has become an enemy of the state, and Brown tries to get him out of the country. Believing Jones is a threat to his relationship with Martha, he persuades him to join the rebels in the north. Jones' lack of military sense is soon revealed and he is killed in action, while the rebellion fails. Duvalier consolidates his power and Brown, unable to return to his hotel, goes to Santo Domingo. There he works as a mortician.  Characters  *Mr. Brown, the protagonist and narrator.

Critical reception The New York Times noted that Greene writes about dark places, and this novel explores Haiti under Duvalier and his paramilitary, known as the Tontons Macoutes. Greene explores \\"despair at evil triumphant, sustained by dollar-aid from the U.S.A.\\"John Bowen, \\"Review: 'The Comedians'\\", The New York Times, 23 January 1966.

But, \\"Nevertheless he [Jones] is the novel's hero. He can die- he can succeed in that- and he dies heroically, covering the retreat of the rest, since his flat feet would only delay the whole party if he were to try to escape with his men.\\" He also praised Greene's writing with \\"much liveliness and skill, and with such a will and ability to please and carry us along\\" that we want to visit his lands. In The New York Review of Books, Sybille Bedford described this tenth novel by Greene as \\"a work of strength and freshness, and in its core there lies the steel coil of compulsion.\\"Sybille Bedford, \\"Tragic Comedians\\", New York Review of Books, 3 March 1966.

All the Messerschmitt and FMR production cars used the Kabinenroller's monocoque structure, featuring tandem seating and usually a bubble canopy. The Kabinenroller platform was used for four microcars, the three-wheeled Messerschmitt KR175 (1953-1955), Messerschmitt KR200 (1955-1964) and Messerschmitt KR201, and the four-wheeled FMR Tg500 (1957-1961). The platform and all four cars using it were designed by Fritz Fend. History The Kabinenroller was designed and developed by Fritz Fend for Messerschmitt AG. Fend had earlier designed and built a series of unpowered and powered invalid carriages, leading up to his Fend Flitzer. Fend noticed that able-bodied people were buying Flitzers for use as personal transport. This led him to believe that a mass-produced two- seat version of the Flitzer would have a ready market. A search for a manufacturer interested in the project led him to Messerschmitt, who had him develop the project for production in their Regensburg factory. The Kabinenroller was designed and developed for production in 1952 and 1953. Production of the original version, the KR175, began in February 1953. 70 modifications had been made to the design by June 1953. Messerschmitt KR200-based record car at Technik Museum Speyer The KR200 was developed on the Kabinenroller platform and replaced the KR175 in 1955. Based on the same frame and an evolution of the original suspension, the KR200 had a large number of detail changes. On 29‚Äì30 August 1955, a modified KR200 with a tuned engine, revised gear ratios, redundant control cables, a one-off streamlined body, and stock suspension, damping, steering, and brakes, was run at the Hockenheimring for twenty-four hours. During the run, the vehicle set twenty-two closed- circuit speed records for three-wheeled vehicles with displacements up to 250 cc, including the fifty-mile record at and the twenty-four-hour record at . Design =Frame= The Kabinenroller was based on a central monocoque tub made from pressed steel sheet and tubular steel. The tub tapered upward from front to rear with a bulkhead at the back. The bulkhead supported a tubular steel subframe and acted as the firewall. The subframe supported the engine and the rear suspension. The engine cover was hinged to the monocoque structure. The fuel tank was in the top of the engine cover and fed the carburettor by gravity. The monocoque tub, with the bulkhead at the back, a nose section at the front, and an access hatch system overhead, formed a passenger compartment for a driver and a passenger sitting in tandem. The base plate on which the hatch was hinged was riveted to the right side of the monocoque tub and the nose section. The hatch was made of a steel sheet base with a glass windshield, a plexiglas bubble canopy, and a framed set of sliding windows on either side of the canopy. The tandem seating allowed the body to be long and narrow, with a low frontal area. This also allowed the body to taper like an aircraft fuselage, within a practical length. =Suspension= Front suspension of the Kr 200 Kabinenroller (the Kr175 had a different arrangement with rubber cones) was by a transverse lower arm sprung by a torsional 3-element rubber spring at the inside end. Front suspension travel was limited by rubber buffers. Rear suspension was by a trailing arm similar to a single-sided motorcycle swingarm which also formed the enclosure for the chain drive to the rear wheel. The trailing arm was suspended by another torsional rubber spring. Hydraulic dampers were added to the design with the introduction of the KR200 in 1955; also the front track was increased at that time. Steering Steering control for Messerschmitt KR200 The shaft of the steering control was connected directly to the track rods controlling the front wheels, resulting in approximately one-third of a turn from the left extreme to the right extreme (\\"lock to lock\\"). The handlebar- shaped steering control would be operated with small, controlled inputs by swivelling the steering bar about its axis from the horizontal (straight- ahead) position instead of rotating it as with a conventional steering wheel. Tg500 sports car Rear subassembly of a Tg500 showing the engine and parts of the suspension, including an upper spring mount on the subframe The performance of the record car convinced Fend to design a sports car based on the Kabinenroller platform. The FMR Tg500 was introduced in 1958, two years after Fahrzeug- und Maschinenbau Gmbh, Regensburg (FMR) took over production of the Kabinenroller from Messerschmitt. The Tg500 used the Kabinenroller's unit body, front bodywork, front suspension, and steering system, but the rear subframe and bodywork were completely different. The Tg500's most noticeable difference from other Kabinenrollern is its pair of rear wheels. These were driven by halfshafts with universal joints at both ends and a sliding spline allowing the length of the shaft to vary, accommodating changes in camber angle. The wheels were suspended by control arms and coil springs with concentric hydraulic shock absorbers. The rear track was The tubular subframe to which the rear suspension was attached also held the drivetrain, which consisted of a transversely-mounted FMR 500 L straight-twin two-stroke engine and an unsynchronized four-speed transaxle with a reverse gear. The Tg500 had a front track of , up from the KR200's . It also used larger tires, 4.40 x 10 to the KR200's 4.40 x 8, and four-wheel hydraulic brakes.

The mathematical approach is used with the goal of deriving hypotheses that are more exact and thus yield stricter empirical validations. Quantifiable behavior is in practice often constituted by task performance. The application of math in psychology could be traced back to at least seventeenth century when scientists like Kepler and Galileo were investigating the laws of mental process. At that time, psychology had not even been recognized as an independent subject of science. The applications of mathematics in psychology can be roughly classified into two areas: one is the mathematical modeling of psychological theories and experimental phenomena which leads to mathematical psychology, the other is the statistical approach of quantitative measurement practices in psychology which leads to psychometrics. There are five major research areas in mathematical psychology: learning and memory, perception and psychophysics, choice and decision making, language and thinking, and measurement and scaling. As quantification of behavior is fundamental in this endeavor, the theory of measurement is a central topic in mathematical psychology. Mathematical psychology is therefore closely related to psychometrics. However, where psychometrics is concerned with individual differences (or population structure) in mostly static variables, mathematical psychology focuses on process models of perceptual, cognitive and motor processes as inferred from the 'average individual'. Furthermore, where psychometrics investigates the stochastic dependence structure between variables as observed in the population, mathematical psychology almost exclusively focuses on the modeling of data obtained from experimental paradigms and is therefore even more closely related to experimental psychology/cognitive psychology/psychonomics. Like computational neuroscience and econometrics, mathematical psychology theory often uses statistical optimality as a guiding principle, assuming that the human brain has evolved to solve problems in an optimized way. Central themes from cognitive psychology; limited vs. unlimited processing capacity, serial vs. parallel processing, etc., and their implications, are central in rigorous analysis in mathematical psychology. Mathematical psychologists are active in many fields of psychology, especially in psychophysics, sensation and perception, problem solving, decision-making, learning, memory, and language, collectively known as cognitive psychology, and the quantitative analysis of behavior but also, e.g., in clinical psychology, social psychology, and psychology of music. History Ernst Heinrich Weber. Gustav Fechner. = Mathematics and Psychology before the 19th Century = Choice and decision making theory are rooted in the development of probability theory. Blaise Pascal considered situations in gambling and further extended to Pascal's wager. In the 18th century, Nicolas Bernoulli proposed the St. Petersburg Paradox in decision making, Daniel Bernoulli gave a solution and Laplace proposed a modification to the solution later on. In 1763, Bayes published the paper \\"An Essay towards solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances\\", which is the milestone of Bayesian statistics. Robert Hooke worked on modeling human memory, which is a precursor of the study of memory. = Mathematics and Psychology in the 19th Century = The research developments in German and England in the 19th century made psychology a new academic subject. Since German approach emphasized experiments in the investigation of the psychological processes that all human share and the England approach was the measurement of individual differences, the applications of mathematics are also different. In German, Wilhelm Wundt established the first experimental psychology laboratory. The math in German psychology is mainly applied in sensory and psychophysics. Ernst Weber (1795‚Äì1878) created the first mathematical law of the mind, Weber's law, based on a variety of experiments. Gustav Fechner (1801‚Äì1887) contributed math theories in sensations and perceptions and one of them is the Fechner's law, which modifies Weber's law. Mathematical modeling has a long history in psychology starting in the 19th century with Ernst Weber (1795‚Äì1878) and Gustav Fechner (1801‚Äì1887) being among the first to apply successful mathematical technique of functional equations from physics to psychological processes. They thereby established the fields of experimental psychology in general, and that of psychophysics in particular. Researchers in astronomy in the 19th century were mapping distances between stars by denoting the exact time of a star's passing of a cross-hair on a telescope. For lack of the automatic registration instruments of the modern era, these time measurements relied entirely on human response speed. It had been noted that there were small systematic differences in the times measured by different astronomers, and these were first systematically studied by German astronomer Friedrich Bessel (1782‚Äì1846). Bessel constructed personal equations from measurements of basic response speed that would cancel out individual differences from the astronomical calculations. Independently, physicist Hermann von Helmholtz measured reaction times to determine nerve conduction speed, developed resonance theory of hearing and the Young-Helmholtz theory of color vision. These two lines of work came together in the research of Dutch physiologist F. C. Donders and his student J. J. de Jaager, who recognized the potential of reaction times for more or less objectively quantifying the amount of time elementary mental operations required. Donders envisioned the employment of his mental chronometry to scientifically infer the elements of complex cognitive activity by measurement of simple reaction time Although there are developments in sensation and perception, Johann Herbart developed a system of mathematical theories in cognitive area to understand the mental process of consciousness. The origin of English psychology can be traced to the theory of evolution by Darwin. But the emergence of English psychology is because of Francis Galton, who interested in individual differences between humans on psychological variables. The math in English psychology is mainly statistics and the work and methods of Galton is the foundation of psychometrics. Galton introduced bivariate normal distribution in modeling the traits of the same individual, he also investigated measurement error and built his own model, and he also developed a stochastic branching process to examine the extinction of family names. There is also a tradition of the interest in studying intelligence in English psychology started from Galton. James McKeen Cattell and Alfred Binet developed tests of intelligence. The first psychological laboratory was established in Germany by Wilhelm Wundt, who amply used Donders' ideas. However, findings that came from the laboratory were hard to replicate and this was soon attributed to the method of introspection that Wundt introduced. Some of the problems resulted from individual differences in response speed found by astronomers. Although Wundt did not seem to take interest in these individual variations and kept his focus on the study of the general human mind, Wundt's U.S. student James McKeen Cattell was fascinated by these differences and started to work on them during his stay in England. The failure of Wundt's method of introspection led to the rise of different schools of thought. Wundt's laboratory was directed towards conscious human experience, in line with the work of Fechner and Weber on the intensity of stimuli. In the United Kingdom, under the influence of the anthropometric developments led by Francis Galton, interest focussed on individual differences between humans on psychological variables, in line with the work of Bessel. Cattell soon adopted the methods of Galton and helped laying the foundation of psychometrics. =20th century= Many statistical methods were developed even before the 20th century: Charles Spearman invented factor analysis which studies individual differences by the variance and covariance. German psychology and English psychology have been combined and taken over by the United States. The statistical methods dominated the field during the beginning of the century. There are two important statistical developments: Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and analysis of variance (ANOVA). Since factor analysis unable to make causal inferences, the method of structural equation modeling was developed by Sewall Wright to correlational data to infer causality, which is still a major research area today. Those statistical methods formed psychometrics. The Psychometric Society was established in 1935 and the journal Psychometrika was published since 1936. In the United States, behaviorism arose in opposition to introspectionism and associated reaction- time research, and turned the focus of psychological research entirely to learning theory. In Europe introspection survived in Gestalt psychology. Behaviorism dominated American psychology until the end of the Second World War, and largely refrained from inference on mental processes. Formal theories were mostly absent (except for vision and hearing). During the war, developments in engineering, mathematical logic and computability theory, computer science and mathematics, and the military need to understand human performance and limitations, brought together experimental psychologists, mathematicians, engineers, physicists, and economists. Out of this mix of different disciplines mathematical psychology arose. Especially the developments in signal processing, information theory, linear systems and filter theory, game theory, stochastic processes and mathematical logic gained a large influence on psychological thinking. Two seminal papers on learning theory in Psychological Review helped to establish the field in a world that was still dominated by behaviorists: A paper by Bush and Mosteller instigated the linear operator approach to learning, and a paper by Estes that started the stimulus sampling tradition in psychological theorizing. These two papers presented the first detailed formal accounts of data from learning experiments. Mathematical modeling of learning process were greatly developed in the 1950s as the behavioral learning theory was flourishing. One development is the stimulus sampling theory by Williams K. Estes, the other is linear operator models by Robert R. Bush, and Frederick Mosteller. Signal processing and detection theory are broadly used in perception, psychophysics and nonsensory area of cognition. Von Neumann's book The Theory of Games and Economic Behavior establish the importance of game theory and decision making. R. Duncan Luce and Howard Raiffa contributed to the choice and decision making area. The area of language and thinking comes into the spot light with the development of computer science and linguistics, especially information theory and computation theory. Chomsky proposed the model of linguistics and computational hierarchy theory. Allen Newell and Herbert Simon proposed the model of human solving problems. The development in artificial intelligence and human computer interface are active areas in both computer science and psychology. Before the 1950s, psychometricians emphasized the structure of measurement error and the development of high-power statistical methods to the measurement of psychological quantities but little of the psychometric work concerned the structure of the psychological quantities being measured or the cognitive factors behind the response data. Scott and Suppes studied relationship between the structure of data and the structure of numerical systems that represent the data. Coombs constructed formal cognitive models of the respondent in a measurement situation rather than statistical data processing algorithms, for example the unfolding model. Another breakthrough is the development of a new form of the psychophysical scaling function along with new methods of collecting psychophysical data, like Stevens' power law. The 1950s saw a surge in mathematical theories of psychological processes, including Luce's theory of choice, Tanner and Swets' introduction of signal detection theory for human stimulus detection, and Miller's approach to information processing. By the end of the 1950s, the number of mathematical psychologists had increased from a handful by more than a tenfold, not counting psychometricians. Most of these were concentrated at the Indiana University, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Stanford.Estes, W. K. (2002). History of the Society Some of these were regularly invited by the U.S. Social Science Research Counsel to teach in summer workshops in mathematics for social scientists at Stanford University, promoting collaboration. To better define the field of mathematical psychology, the mathematical models of the 1950s were brought together in sequence of volumes edited by Luce, Bush, and Galanter: Two readingsLuce, R. D., Bush, R. R. & Galanter, E. (Eds.) (1963). Readings in mathematical psychology. Volumes I & II. New York: Wiley. and three handbooks.Luce, R. D., Bush, R. R. & Galanter, E. (Eds.) (1963). Handbook of mathematical psychology. Volumes I-III. New York: Wiley. Volume II from Internet Archive This series of volumes turned out to be helpful in the development of the field. In the summer of 1963 the need was felt for a journal for theoretical and mathematical studies in all areas in psychology, excluding work that was mainly factor analytical. An initiative led by R. C. Atkinson, R. R. Bush, W. K. Estes, R. D. Luce, and P. Suppes resulted in the appearance of the first issue of the Journal of Mathematical Psychology in January, 1964. Under the influence of developments in computer science, logic, and language theory, in the 1960s modeling gravitated towards computational mechanisms and devices. Examples of the latter constitute so called cognitive architectures (e.g., production rule systems, ACT-R) as well as connectionist systems or neural networks. Important mathematical expressions for relations between physical characteristics of stimuli and subjective perception are Weber‚ÄìFechner law, Ekman's law, Stevens's power law, Thurstone's law of comparative judgment, the theory of signal detection (borrowed from radar engineering), the matching law, and Rescorla‚ÄìWagner rule for classical conditioning. While the first three laws are all deterministic in nature, later established relations are more fundamentally stochastic. This has been a general theme in the evolution in mathematical modeling of psychological processes: from deterministic relations as found in classical physics to inherently stochastic models.

It was first organized in Cincinnati, Ohio, as the International Holiness Union and Prayer League (IHU/IAHC). Knapp, founder of the IAHC, ordained and his Worldwide Missions Board sent Charles and Lettie Cowman who had attended God's Bible School to Japan in December 1900. By the International Apostolic Holiness Churches Foreign Missionary Board and the co- board of the Revivalist the Cowmans had been appointed the General Superintendents and the Kilbournes the vice-General Superintendent for Korea, Japan and China December 29, 1905. The organization later became the Pilgrim Holiness Church in 1922 which eventually merged with the Wesleyan Methodists in 1968 to form the Wesleyan Church. In 1937, the Emmanuel Association was formed as a result of a schism with the Pilgrim Holiness Church; it became one of the first denominations of the conservative holiness movement. Today, two groups of Pilgrim Holiness churches still exist from the secession of the merger in 1968-the Pilgrim Holiness Church, Inc. (of the Midwest) and the Pilgrim Holiness Church of NY, Inc. These two groups are not associated with the Wesleyan Church today but align themselves with the Conservative Holiness Movement. Among many other Holiness children, the Korea Holiness Church, daughter of the IAHC/PHC, has approximately 10,000 churches globally and two million members in the four holiness denominations in 2010. History 1897-1968 The Pilgrim Holiness Church came into being as a result of the revival of scriptural holiness that swept across the various denominations in America in the last half of the nineteenth century, the same awakening that had rechanneled the energies of the Wesleyan Methodist Connection from social and political reform to holiness evangelism. The awakening crystallized in the establishment of many nondenominational and interdenominational holiness unions and associations and independent churches. Toward the close of the nineteenth century many of like faith began to draw together. = International Holiness Union and Prayer League = A focal point for the beginning of The Pilgrim Holiness Church as an organization was the formation of the International Holiness Union and Prayer League in September 1897, at Cincinnati, Ohio, in the home of Martin Wells Knapp. Rev. Seth C. Rees was chosen President, and Rev. Martin Wells Knapp, Vice-President. The Union was not thought of as a church, nor intended as such, but was an interdenominational fellowship, marked by simplicity and the absence of restrictions. The primary purpose of the Union was to unite holiness people in promotion of worldwide holiness evangelism. A fourfold emphasis was declared concerning the regeneration of sinners, the entire sanctification of believers, the premillennial and imminent return of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the evangelization of the world. The Union met the need of many people for fellowship and cooperation in the spread of scriptural holiness and grew rapidly. Extensive revival work was carried on by members of the Union, resulting in the formation of the many city missions, churches, rescue homes, and camp meetings. = International Apostolic Holiness Union = In the annual meeting of the Union held in July 1900, the name was changed to International Apostolic Holiness Union in order to express more fully the aim of promoting a return to apostolic principles and practices. Also in 1900 the foreign missionary work began as members of the Union went out as faith missionaries to South Africa, India, Japan [Korea], the West Indies, and South America. = International Apostolic Holiness Church = The Union gradually developed into a church organization in order to provide church homes for the converts and the conservation of the work. In 1905 the name was changed to International Apostolic Holiness Union and Churches. At the General Assembly of 1905 the Foreign Missionary Board and the co-board of the Revivalist had appointed Charles and Lettie Cowman the General Superintedent and Edwin A. Kilbourne the Vice-General Superintendent for Korea, Japan and China. The interdenominational features also faded out, and in 1913 the name was altered to International Apostolic Holiness Church. In 1919, the Indiana, Illinois- Missouri, and Kansas-Oklahoma Conferences of the Holiness Christian Church were received by the General Assembly of the International Apostolic Holiness Church. The Holiness Christian Church had its beginning in a revival movement around Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1882, and was organized at Linwood, Pennsylvania, in 1889 as the Holiness Christian Association. By 1919 it was known as the Holiness Christian Church and was composed of four conferences; it also sponsored a missionary work in Central America. The Pentecostal Rescue Mission joined the International Holiness Church in March 1922, and became the New York District. It had originated at Binghamton, New York, in 1897, and had spread until it included missions, rescue work, camp meetings, orphanage activities, churches, and a missionary work in Alaska. = The Pilgrim Holiness Church = In October 1922, the General Assembly, in special session, received The Pilgrim Church of California and adopted the name, The Pilgrim Holiness Church. The Pilgrim Church was first organized on May 27, 1917, as the Pentecost-Pilgrim Church in Pasadena, California. By 1922, a school known as Pilgrim Bible School had been established and a periodical was being published at Pasadena, California, and missionaries had been sent out to Mexico. In 1924, a group of several churches known as the Pentecostal Brethren in Christ united with and became part of the Ohio District of The Pilgrim Holiness Church. In 1925, The People's Mission Church, with headquarters at Colorado Springs, Colorado, became part of The Pilgrim Holiness Church. It was the outgrowth of revival work that began in 1898 in Colorado Springs and spread through several surrounding states. A Bible school was operated, a periodical published, and a camp meeting maintained at Colorado Springs. In 1946, The Holiness Church of California was received by the General Conference into The Pilgrim Holiness Church. The Church, which began in a revival movement in 1880 and was first known as The Holiness Bands, maintained a Bible school at El Monte, California, and a growing missionary work in Peru and Palestine. The Africa Evangelistic Mission, with headquarters at Boksburg, Transvaal, South Africa, was received by The Pilgrim Holiness Church in 1962. The Mission carried on work organized into three districts, two of which were located in the Orange Free State and Transvaal in the Republic of South Africa, and a third district comprising extensive work in Mozambique. The growth of the Pilgrim Holiness Church continued through revival work and evangelism in greater measure than by the uniting of other bodies. An important turning point in the organizational structure was reached in 1930 when the General Assembly unified the administration of the denomination by providing for one general superintendent, one general board, and a general headquarters at Indianapolis, Indiana. In 1958 a plan for three general superintendents was inaugurated. In 1962 the general conference, known until 1942 as the General Assembly, was designated as the International Conference in recognition of the growth and development of the overseas work. The original purpose of the founders of The Pilgrim Holiness Church to promote worldwide holiness evangelism remained an indelible characteristic. Missionary work was carried on in many lands, and The Pilgrim Holiness Church extended beyond the United States and Canada to the following places: South Africa, including Natal, Transvaal, Cape Province, and Orange Free State; Swaziland; Mozambique; Zambia; the Caribbean area, including Grand Cayman, Jamaica, St. Croix, St. Thomas, Saba, St. Kitts, Nevis, Antigua, Barbuda, Barbados, St. Vincent, Trinidad and Tobago, and Cura√ßao; Guyana; Suriname; Brazil; Peru; Mexico; Philippine Islands; and England. In 1937, the Emmanuel Association was formed as a result of a schism with the Pilgrim Holiness Church (PHC) spearheaded by Ralph Goodrich Finch, the PHC General Superintendent of Foreign Missions; it became one of the first denominations of the conservative holiness movement. Merger between The Pilgrim Holiness Church and The Wesleyan Methodist Church of America was proposed at various times, and was voted upon by the General Conferences of the two bodies in 1958 and 1959, failing to pass in the Wesleyan Methodist General Conference by a margin of a single vote. In 1962, the General Conference of The Pilgrim Holiness Church took action expressing renewed interest in union with The Wesleyan Methodist Church. In 1963, the General Conference of The Wesleyan Methodist Church took like action, instructing its Committee on Church Union to pursue its work with all due diligence. On June 15, 1966, the Thirty-Second General Conference of The Wesleyan Methodist Church adopted The Basis for Merger and Constitution, and subsequently the annual conferences and local churches ratified the action. On June 16, 1966, the Twenty-Fifth International Conference of The Pilgrim Holiness Church also adopted The Basis for Merger and Constitution. Thus the formation of The Wesleyan Church was authorized. The General Board of The Pilgrim Holiness Church and the General Board of Administration of The Wesleyan Methodist Church cooperated in planning the uniting General Conference, and in preparing the new book of Discipline for its consideration. On June 26, 1968, The Pilgrim Holiness Church and The Wesleyan Methodist Church of America were united to form The Wesleyan Church.Material gathered from The Discipline of The Wesleyan Church 1996, Copyright ¬© 1997 by Wesley Press  Pilgrim Holiness Church, Inc. (Midwest), Est. 1966  In 1966, the pastors of two small Pilgrim Holiness Churches in Illinois felt the need to withdraw from the formal organization which, in their opinion, seemed to smother their love for Godliness and holy living. In December of that year, Rev. Eugene Gray informed his Bloomington, Ill., church that he was resigning and leaving the denomination, and that they were free to do whatever they felt they should. The Church felt this should be a church decision, and set the date for the membership vote. During the last week of December, the church voted to withdraw from the denomination. During this same year in Decatur, Illinois, Pastor James Southerland was also making decisions. The Board had voted unanimously not to go with the merger, and in January 1967, the church body voted against it also. A Statement of Purpose was drawn up and presented to the Church for its consideration. This Statement was addressed to the Council of the Illinois District and was speaking to three aspects of the issue. They felt, first of all, that spiritually they would not benefit due to the trend of worldliness and wavering from the standards and convictions of the Founding Fathers. Secondly, they asked the Council to consider letting the Illinois District as a whole be excluded from the merger. If this was not possible, the Decatur church was willing to stand alone. Thirdly, they asked for a clear title to their property. If these requests were not granted the Church was still standing against the merger and would withdraw from the General Church. After meeting with the Council and a lawsuit, the Decatur Church was able to purchase their property from the General Church, but the Bloomington Church chose not to do so, and purchased the property where they are now worshipping. These two churches at Decatur, Illinois, and Bloomington, Illinois, considered becoming a part of the New York group, but felt that due to geographical separation, it would be better to form a self-supporting group, and work in cooperation with the New York body. In December 1966 a committee was formed by the council of the New York Pilgrim Holiness Church, Inc. Rev. Eugene Gray was appointed as Chairman. Rev. James Southerland was appointed Secretary; Rev. John Yount, as Advisor. They petitioned the N. Y. PHC to organize an autonomous conference in the midwest. Thus, the first five churches to join were: * Bloomington, ILL (Pastor: Rev. Eugene Gray) * Decatur, ILL (Pastor: Rev. James Southerland) * Evansville, IN (Pastor: Rev. John Yount) * Petersburg, IN (Pastor: Rev. James Sneed) * Franklin, IN (Pastor: Rev. Don Walden) A new organization known as the Midwest Conference of the Pilgrim Holiness Church of New York, was then begun. June 16‚Äì25, 1967, the 1st annual Camp Meeting was held indoors at the Decatur Pilgrim Holiness Church located at 2615 Prairie Ave. Rev. Victor Glenn (Director of Faith Missions, Bedford, IN) & Rev. James McLaren (Evangelist- Binghamton, N.Y.) were the evangelists. Mrs. Shirley Gray and Paul Gray provided special singing. Rev. Eugene Gray served as Chairman and Rev. James Southerland as Host Pastor. The purpose for this camp meeting was to unify the Churches and to bring them together for fellowship. By the time the 1st conference was held in August 1967, five other churches had joined the group. The 1st Conference Session was held at the Illiana Camp Ground in Terre Haute, IN, on August 26, 1967. The Holy Spirit placed His seal of approval upon the conference from the opening prayer. Shouts arose from the congregation and numerous testimonies were given as the glory of the Lord descended upon His people. The following men were elected to serve as the first Conference Council: * Rev. Eugene Gray (President) * Rev. James Sneed (Vice President) * Rev. J. A. Southerland (Secretary) * Rev. C. Marion Brown (Treasurer) * Rev. John Yount (Advisory Council Member) * Rev. Ed Shemalia (Advisory Council Member) By 1971, the Conference had become an autonomous body. The next year they reorganized as the Pilgrim Holiness Church, Incorporated, dropping the phrase \\"Of the Midwest\\" from their charter. They also drafted their own discipline, instead of using that of the New York Pilgrims.  Pilgrim Holiness Church of NY, Inc. Est. 1963  The New York Pilgrims trace their organizational roots back to 1897, when first organized as the Pentecostal Rescue Mission of Binghamton, New York. For a time this growing group of churches shared organizational ties with larger denominational groups, but joined the Pilgrim Holiness Church in 1922. In 1963 the New York District seceded from the Pilgrim Holiness Church and once more became an independent organization, and now the Conference has more than 50 churches.  Doctrine  In doctrine and practice they are conservative evangelicals of Wesleyan-Arminian persuasion who believe the Bible is the only written word of God, with the original text inspired by God and without error. They believe the Creator God has revealed Himself to us in three persons: the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. They believe in the necessity of personal salvation by grace through faith in the atoning blood of Jesus Christ. They believe that the Holy Spirit is instrumental in leading a believer to recognize the need of holiness of heart, wrought instantaneously as a second definite work of grace when one's will is yielded to God's, therefore making it possible for him to perfectly love God with all his heart, soul, mind and strength. They believe in the imminent return of Jesus Christ for the taking away of the universal Church of God. The Korea Holiness Church as the Daughter of IAHC Among many other Holiness children, the Korea Holiness Church (KHC), daughter of the IAHC/PHC since 1905, emphasizes on a full gospel or the four-fold gospel mottos: regeneration, the baptism with Holy Spirit as the entire sanctification, divine healing and the second coming of Jesus with doing home evangelism and sending overseas missionaries. The KHC has approximately 10,000 churches globally and two million members in the four Korean holiness denominations in 2010. Seoul Theological University, organ of the Korea Evangelical Holiness Church (KEHC 8,000 churches and 0.8 million members), has 5,000 students. Sung Kyul (Holiness) University, organ of Korea Jesus Holiness Church, separated from KEHC 1961, has 9,000 students. Korea Nazarene University, organ of the KNHC, separated from KEHC in 1948, has 7,000 students. Korea Church of God, separated from KEHC in 1936 has 100 holiness churches in Korea.

He lives with his daughter Carrie and her husband, Doug Heffernan in Rego Park, Queens. Biography Little is known about Arthur's early life. He was born in 1925 to an abusive father (played in one episode by Stiller's own son, Ben Stiller), but nothing is known about his mother. He lived on a farm from the ages of 7 to 10, then again at 43, was a gifted singer as a child, performed jigs for the workers at the Empire State Building, has an estranged half-brother named Skitch (played in one episode by Shelley Berman), was bald until the age of 12,Season 1, Episode 14, \\"Dog Days\\" and lost his virginity to someone named Peppermint Patty. He possibly attended the State University of New York at Oneonta, having mentioned playing for the \\"Oneonta Red Dragons\\".Season 7, Episode 17 \\"Wish Boned\\" Arthur served in World War II in the Italian theater and in The Battle of the Bulge, and also mentions being in Paris, France. He variously claims to have been in the US Army 33rd Brigade and the 71st Infantry Division. At some point during his enlistment, he left a man named Jack Russell for dead. Sometime after the war, Arthur took up a career as an actor, performing on Broadway and at other venues. It was during this time that he met his first wife, Sophia, a show dancer. After a night of passion, the couple found out that Sophia was pregnant, and decided to get married for the sake of the child, Simone (later Carrie). Arthur lost Carrie's birth name of Simone in a poker game and she had to switch names with her cousin Carrie. (Carrie has no recollection of this incident.) He quit his acting career in an attempt to create a more stable life for his daughter. Ironically, his unstable marital life and always unsure job situation led to even less security than Carrie might have had if Arthur remained an actor. Doug and Carrie occasionally point out this fact, but Arthur always discounts it. During Carrie's young life Arthur held an innumerable number of jobs, including at a crab cannery in Maryland, jobs in sales, a brief stint working for PBS on Sesame Street, and many others. He worked briefly in customer service, stating if a little person walked into his store it was all he could talk about for years. He also sold ribbons at the time Doug and Carrie were purchasing their home. He thought it was a good idea to cut out the middle man and offer little girls in the schoolyard ribbons to buy for their hair, which Carrie convinced him was a bad idea. He was unable to maintain any of these careers for more than a month at a time, resulting in a very volatile home life for his family. Though he was never able to hold down a job for very long, he did land 74 of them, one as a woman. However, in another episode, he claims to have had \\"nearly 200.\\" In 1985, Sophia Spooner died, leaving Arthur a widower and the single parent of fifteen-year-old Carrie. With Arthur unable to stay employed, Carrie was forced to work in addition to attending high school. Because of this, she never attended college. During a Thanksgiving episode, it was mentioned that Arthur met his second wife Lilly at a bus stop. Arthur said \\"Why don't you go back to the corner where I found you?!\\", and Lilly replied \\"I was waiting for the bus!\\" In the pilot episode, Arthur's third wife Tessie has died. Arthur subsequently burns his house down while cooking on his \\"lucky hot plate.\\" This forces Arthur and his other daughter Sara (who was written out during the first season without explanation) to move in with Carrie and Doug. Arthur quickly shows himself to be obnoxious, boorish, and mentally unstable, frequently bursting into tirades at the slightest provocation. His grating personality angers Doug, but as the series progresses, they grow accustomed to each other. Perhaps Arthur's most notable trait was his tendency to speak in flowing, elegant sentences, typically employing long words. He also frequently used outdated expressions, such as \\"cat's feet.\\" Likewise, he calls cell phones \\"cellular telephones\\", referred to Istanbul as \\"Constantinople\\" and identifies catsup by its proper name rather than by the popular brand name that is universally called \\"Ketchup.\\" Arthur always adamantly refused to be outdone or slighted in any conceivable manner. During the course of the show, he forced a woman to lose her job because she \\"hurt his feelings\\", caused countless false emergencies at his senior center, reduced many people to tears, investigated purported similarities between himself and fictional characters, engaged in arguments with tough younger individuals, often forcing Doug to protect him, loudly proclaimed most of his views on Doug and Carrie's wedding video, and relentlessly insulted Douglas' friends, particularly Spence. A good example of Arthur's behavior is when he discovers an old episode airing of The $10,000 Pyramid on which he appeared in 1976, a fact that he has told Doug \\"several dozen times.\\" When asked if he won, Arthur, in turn, asks if he would be \\"living in this dump if [he had].\\" He later asks for Carrie's help in \\"[suing] the boyish grin off of Dick Clark's face\\" because he never got the full year's supply of Rice-A-Roni that he had been promised after the appearance, a scandal he has named \\"Rice-A-Roni-gate.\\" In an effort to placate Arthur, Clark's representative offers to give him a book instead of the boxed rice dish, the continued production of which the representative is unsure. After assuring the representative that Rice-A-Roni is \\"still made in a variety of mouth-watering flavors,\\" Arthur refuses screaming, \\"I don't wanna read. I wanna eat!\\" Arthur ultimately receives a 30-year supply of Rice-A-Roni, in addition to the original supply he was promised on the game show, after (presumably) blackmailing Dick Clark with a photo of the TV icon \\"locked in a muddy embrace with Fannie Flagg,\\" which was captured from his appearance on the Battle of the Network Stars. (The vintage Pyramid clip used for the episode is from an actual appearance Stiller made on the game show that same year.)Season 7, Episode 12, \\"Gym Neighbors\\" Additionally, in the season 6 episode \\"Trash Talker,\\" Arthur mentions that he allegedly has a lifelong hatred for Larry King, stemming from when they were kids and Arthur stole one of King's prized baseball cards and was subsequently kicked out of school after King tattled on him. Arthur marries his fourth wife Veronica Olchin (played by Stiller's real wife Anne Meara), mother of Doug's friend Spence Olchin, in the series finale \\"China Syndrome\\" and divorce one year later. One of his most often used quotes is \\"How dare you!\\" He has also been known to say \\"Thank you very little!\\", and \\"That's a separate issue!\\" He often remarks to those who pry into his business, \\"That's none of your affair!\\" When he feels that he is being pushed around or told what to do (usually by his daughter, Carrie), Arthur often responds by implying that the person is a dictator (e.g. \\"yes, mein fuhrer!\\") or a smear tactic politician (e.g. \\"no thank you Senator McCarthy!\\"). He almost invariably addresses or refers to Doug by his full name \\"Douglas\\". Likewise, when he addresses Doug's cousin Danny, he calls him his full name \\"Daniel\\". He also addresses Spence by his full name \\"Spencer\\", Doug and Carrie's neighbor Lou Ferrigno as \\"Louis\\" and Deacon as \\"Mr. Palmer\\".Episode 95 \\"Missing Links\\" Arthur and Holly enter the front door and upon seeing Deacon on the couch, Arthur says \\"Good Evening to you Mr. Palmer.\\" Role in the series Sarcastic, brash, and always scheming, Arthur lives in the basement of Doug and Carrie's house. Quick to take offense, he shouts frequently and often unnecessarily, and often comes up with absolutely absurd, irregular, or illogical money-making scams. He is basically a selfish, narcissistic individual who feels the world owes him, and that he needs to be treated a certain way for who he thinks he is. Arthur frequently makes bizarre claims (for example, that he invented the moist towelette, and claiming that Charles M. Schulz based Charlie Brown on Arthur's life). He also steals change from Doug's nightstand. Arthur is walked by a dog walker named Holly Shumpert (Nicole Sullivan), and his best friend is Mickey (Ford Rainey). Arthur is outspoken for left-leaning political views and in some episodes a supporter of the communist nations around the world. In the episode \\"Steve Moscow\\" he claims that the Soviet Union was a \\"workers' paradise,\\" and in the episode \\"Strike Out\\", he says that he was once enrolled at a socialist summer camp. When Doug goes on strike, Arthur almost kisses him out of pride; these feelings of affection quickly turn into disgust when Doug takes a job at a school as a substitute teacher (with Arthur angrily remarking: \\"Whatever helps you sleep at night you douche\\"). However, in one episode, in a debate with Spence on whether the United States should lift the embargo on Cuba, Arthur was against the lifting of the embargo and Spence was for it (yet, in context, the debate was a scene where Arthur tried to prove he could withstand any argument, resulting in him deferring from the point, and vehemently insulting Spence).Season 5, Episode 16 - \\"Arthur and Spence debate, King Of Queens\\" Arthur's eccentricity extends to going so far as to explicitly forbid a variety of things from the Heffernan household, including but not limited to: Halloween, red pens, soft cheese, non-American VCRs (but not DVD players), any mention of Franklin D. Roosevelt's paralytic illness, and miniature Kit Kats. At times he can offer fatherly advice, and cares about Doug and Carrie. In the episode \\"Deacon Blues\\" he tells Carrie, \\"You're not angry cookie, you're scared\\", as to show Carrie her true feelings. Other times, however, he may become a burden on Doug and Carrie, which Doug claims is unfair because he owns the house. Arthur's odd behavior is said to result from him being neglected as a child. He is often seen as a child because Doug and Carrie have to take care of him. However, around strangers, he often claims that he owns the home (in one episode, after discovering what the property is worth, he stages an 'open house', taking offers on the place), his daughter works at menial labor despite Arthur's invented wealth, and Doug is a complete deadbeat. Arthur's handling of money is often a matter of contention. He regularly steals change from Doug and has, according to Carrie, \\"no retirement, no insurance, no Social Security.\\" He once planned to save a large amount of money for a potential grandchild, but only remarks \\"the dog races are terribly fixed.\\" He often claims to be very wealthy, especially when wooing women. He has almost no money at all, not even a few dollars, as a check he writes for a $1.42 coffee bounces. Insulted by the barista's distrust of his financial situation, he claims to have vast offshore accounts, and is in the process of moving money around.  Casting of the role  According to the DVD commentary of the Pilot episode, the character of Arthur was conceived with Jerry Stiller in mind, but he initially turned down the role. Veteran comedian Jack Carter was then cast and a pilot was shot. Soon afterward, Stiller changed his mind and took the part, which required reshooting of scenes featuring Carter.

The party was formed by residents and some chiefs of Ba Province to contest the 1999 elections, but failed to win any seats in the House of Representatives. Following the coup d'√©tat which deposed the elected government of Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry in 2000, the BKV contested the election held to restore democracy in 2001. This time, they had former interim Prime Minister Ratu Tevita Momoedonu (a defector from the Fiji Labour Party) as their leader, but once again, they won no seats, though they received 2.2 percent of the popular vote. In 2004 the BKV merged with the Party of National Unity (PANU), also a Ba-based party, to form the People's National Party (PNP) under the leadership of former Cabinet Minister Meli Bogileka, and was officially deregistered on 14 August 2005. Bogileka declared that officials from the two parties wanted Ba Province to have a single party to represent their interests at the parliamentary election scheduled for 2006. The merger proved complicated, however. PANU spokesman Senator Ponipate Lesavua announced on 11 January 2006 that he had reregistered the defunct party, and on 23 January that the BKV had also seceded from the PNP and had signed an agreement to merge with PANU. On 5 March, the BKV, PANU, and the PNP all decided to resume the merger, but this time under the PANU banner.

History Jaffa was fortified by Godfrey of Bouillon after the First Crusade in 1100, and was unsuccessfully claimed by Daimbert of Pisa, the first Latin Patriarch. It remained part of the royal domain until it was given to Hugh of Le Puiset in 1110. When Hugh II rebelled against King Fulk in 1134 the county was divided into a number of smaller holdings, and Jaffa itself became a royal domain. Soon it was designated as the apanage of Fulk's second son, Amalric. After the siege of Ascalon in 1153, Fulk's first son King Baldwin III conquered Ascalon, and it was added to the territory of his brother Amalric.Runciman, A History of the Crusades, Vol. II: The Kingdom of Jerusalem and the Frankish East, 1100-1187, pp. 339-340 It passed in and out of direct royal control when its holders were husbands or close relatives of the then-reigning Monarch or royal heir, or its usufruct went to a member of the royal family. In that period, it usually produced income for one or several members of Amalric's first family. In 1221 it was given to Walter IV of Brienne by his uncle John of Brienne, Walter being married to a granddaughter of King Amalric II, who had held the county as successor of his brother King Guy. Around 1250 it was given to a branch of the Ibelin family. With the capture of Jaffa by Baibars in 1268, the county became titular. It was bestowed anew upon John Perez Fabrice by James II of Cyprus and Jerusalem.

It is the administrative seat of the B√∂rde district. Geography It is situated on the Ohre river, near the confluence with its Beber tributary, and the parallel Mittelland Canal, running from the fertile Magdeburg B√∂rde basin to the Elbe river in the east. The town centre is located approximately northwest from Magdeburg. It is connected by railway to the neighbouring towns of Magdeburg, Oebisfelde and Eilsleben. The municipal area includes the village of S√ºplingen, incorporated in 2014. History Haldensleben Roland The Saxon fortress of hahaldeslevo in Eastphalia was first mentioned in a 966 deed of donation issued by Emperor Otto I. The Counts of Haldensleben rose to considerable power, most notably Dietrich and William, who ruled as margraves of the Northern March. Soon after a trading place (Neuhaldensleben) arose nearby, which was vested with market rights about 1150. Besieged and devastetd by the forces of Archbishop Wichmann in 1181, the Haldensleben estates belonged to the Prince-Archbishopric of Magdeburg from 1215. Rebuilding of the town began in 1223, and Archbishop Albert I established a Cistercian abbey at Althaldensleben. The citizens again received market rights in 1526. The Protestant Reformation was implemented in 1541 and in 1680 the former episcopal lands were secularized as the Duchy of Magdeburg, held by the Hohenzollern rulers of Brandenburg-Prussia. Nearby Hundisburg Castle was owned by the House of Alvensleben from 1452 until 1811, enlarged in baroque style, with formal gardens, by Hermann Korb from 1693 on the order of Johann Friedrich II. von Alvensleben (1657-1728), a Hanoverian minister of George I of Great Britain. It was partly destroyed by fire in 1945 and reconstructed since 1994.

An old equestrian statue of Roland symbolized the rights of a medieval settlement to be accepted as a town. It is the only statue of Roland sitting on a horse in the world. Before 1938, when it merged with Althaldensleben, the town was called Neuhaldensleben.
