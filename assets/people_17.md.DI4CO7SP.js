She has climbed Mount Everest nine times, the most of any woman in the world. In 2000, She became the first Nepalese woman to climb and descend Everest successfully. In 2016, she was listed as one of BBC's 100 Women.  Early life  Sherpa grew up in Balakharka, a village in the Makalu, Nepal region of the Himalayas. She is one of 11 children.  Career  In 2000 she was the leader of an expedition sponsored by Asian Trekking. On September 18, 2000 she became the first Nepali woman to summit Mount Everest and survive (see also Pasang Lhamu Sherpa). This climb was with the Nepali Women Millennium Expedition. In 2003, the U.S. PBS noted that she had summited Mount Everest three times, the most for a woman. In May 2003 she reached the summit with her sister and brother; Ming Kipa and Mingma Gelu. By 2007 Sherpa had summited Everest six times since 1999 and her husband summited nine. That year they hosted a presentation about their 2007 Everest trip, with donations taken for Quaker Lane Cooperative Nursery School. George and Lhapka summited Mount Everest 5 times together. In 2016 she summited Mount Everest from Tibet (China), making her seventh summit. The president of Mount Everest Summiteers' Association, a Nepali women and high-altitude worker Maya Sherpa also summited, but from Nepal. Maya Sherpa is another record-setting Nepali woman, and she has also summited K2.  Climbing career achievements  Everest summitings: # 2000 # 2001 # 2003 # 2004 # 2005 # 2006 # 2016 # 2017 # 2018 Additional expeditions: * Expedition to climb K2 in 2010, did not summit but made it to camp 3 before being turned back by bad weather * Expedition to Everest in 2015; made it to base camp in Tibet, but turned back by the Spring earthquakes in the Himalayas (see also 2015 Mount Everest avalanches and/or April 2015 Nepal earthquake)  Personal life  Lhapka is named for the day of the week she was born on (Wednesday). Although born in Nepal, she is now a U.S. resident and a works at taking care of her three children and various jobs. She has worked at the U.S. store 7 Eleven. However, in interviews she noted her desire for the mountain, a condition previously seen in such climbers as George Mallory and Yuichiro Miura according to U.K media outlet The Daily Telegraph. She has two daughters and one son, and was married to George Dijmarescu, a Romanian-American, for 12 years. They met in 2000 in Kathmandu, Nepal and got married in 2002. In 2008 George got cancer, which combined with medical bills was noted as one of the factors that created tension in their marriage. In 2016, she began again receiving recognition in various news arenas as the woman with the most Everest summitings, and completed her seventh summit that year.  Family and relationships  Her little sister Mingma reached the summit of Mount Everest on May 22, 2003 when she was 15 years old (she climbed with Lhakpa and Gelu), thus becoming the youngest woman and person known to have summited Mount Everest (see also Temba Tsheri and Jordan Romero). Her brother is Mingma Gelu Sherpa and is noted to have reached the summit of Mount Everest eight times by 2016. The BBC noted that when three of them reached the summit together in 2003, that was the first group of three siblings on the summit at the same time, as recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records. On the 2004 Connecticut Everest Expedition her then-husband Dijmarescu struck Lhapka. According to Michael Kodas, a journalist present during the expedition, Dijmarescu, \\"hook[ed] a blow with his right hand to the side of his wife's head.\\" This altercation \\"sparked a sort of media sensation in the mountaineering world\\".

Despite the different weights, 15N is involved in the same chemical reactions as the more abundant 14N and is therefore used to trace and quantify conversions of one nitrogen compound to another. 15N tracing is applied in biogeochemistry, soil science, environmental science, environmental microbiology and small molecule activation research.  Applications  15N tracing allows researchers to distinguish specific nitrogen conversions from a network of simultaneous reactions; e.g. ammonium can at the same time be oxidised by autotrophic microorganisms, produced by mineralisation of organic matter, produced by dissimilatory nitrate reduction and assimilated by microbes and plants. In this case, quantifying the absolute amounts of ammonium does not explain how it is produced or consumed. However, the conversion of one 15N labelled compound to another can directly be linked through the isotopic signature. 15N tracing has been applied to quantify rates of nitrogen transformations in soil and to distinguish the sources of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide under different environmental conditions.  Methodical approaches  The two main approaches are natural abundance and enrichment techniques. = Natural abundance techniques = Natural abundance techniques can be applied without artificial disturbance. The natural 15N abundances are expressed in delta (δ) notation relative to the 15N concentration in the air. Due to enzymatic discrimination, natural 15N abundances change slightly in microbially mediated reactions in soil. Apart from δ values, the site preference of 15N and 14N (isotopomers) for the inner or outer position within the nitrous oxide molecule has been used to determine its sources (nitrification or denitrification). = Enrichment techniques = When nitrogen substrates are artificially enriched (labeled) with 15N, the product of a reaction can directly be linked to its substrate. In contrast to natural abundance techniques, 15N labeling allows to precisely calculate reaction rates. The amendment of additional nitrogen can also be a bias by changing natural nitrogen transformations. In agricultural soil, however, application of 15N enriched tracers, such as ammonium and nitrate, resembles conventional fertilisation practise. A way to calculate nitrogen transformation rates in soil can be achieved by numerical approximation that takes different, simultaneous nitrogen transformations into account. A numerical tool to study the nitrogen cycle is the Ntrace model based on a Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation.

Here he produced cartoons for the school magazine at the age of twelve, and two years later his first cartoon was published by the Manchester Evening News. He was a choirboy at Manchester Cathedral in the years 1930–33. When his parents split up he left school at sixteen to work for Lorne & Howarth, an interior design company, studying architecture, mechanical drawing and furniture design at Manchester School of Art in his spare time. This led to a 1938 position as trainee engineer, for companies which included Rolls-Royce, Ford and Kestrel Engines. 1939 found him working for the Manchester art agency Kayebon Press as assistant to Hugh McNeill on strips like Pansy Potter for The Dandy and The Beano. During World War II he joined the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve Signals, began contributing to Blighty, and was posted to India, Ceylon and Persia.https://www.lambiek.net/artists/h/hargreaves.htmhttps://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/dec/08/guardianobituaries Following the War Hargreaves worked at Gaumont British as a trainee animator in the period 1946–49. Here he met Penny Vickery whom he married in 1948, the couple raising two daughters. The 1950s saw the closing of Gaumont British and his return to freelance strip work in children's comics with his work on 'Harold Hare' and 'Ollie the Alley Cat' in The Sun, 'Don Quickshot' in Knockout Fun Book and 'Terry the Troubadour' in TV Comic. In 1953 he moved to Amsterdam to work at the studio of Dutch cartoonist Marten Toonder, being involved with the production of Panda, which at that time was syndicated to a hundred and fifty European papers, including the London Evening News. Returning to England in 1954, Hargreaves carried on drawing the strip until 1961. In 1957 Hargreaves began contributing to Punch, a relationship which would last 17 years. In October 1958 he created 'The Bird', cartoon strips featuring a small, cheeky, wren-like bird. This was so successful that he was paid a retainer. The year 1968 saw the debut of a daily strip, 'The Hayseeds', for the London Evening News. It featured talking animals and was based on Walt Kelly's strip Pogo, but not as political. This strip was dropped in 1974 when the London Evening News adopted a tabloid format, but its popularity rescued it and it continued until 1980. In 1969 Hargreaves designed the 'Deep Sea Band' cereal premiums for Australian plastics company Rosenhain & Lipmann. These were included in boxes of Kellogg's cereal in Australia, the UK, and Japan. Other Hargreaves premiums for R&L; and Kellogg's included 'Camel Train', 'Tooly Birds', and 'Fringes', all of which were released on the US market.

Between 1957 and 2004 he got elected six times to the State Legislative Assembly. Rajeshwara Rao was active in the Quit India Movement and the struggle against the Nizam's rule of Hyderabad. During the resistance he spent 5 years underground and in jail before entering electoral politics following the integration of Hyderabad state into the Indian Union. He was a long-time member of the Communist Party of India and in 1999 joined the Telugu Desam Party. He retired from active politics in 2009.  Childhood and education  Rajeshwara Rao was born to Chennamaneni Chandramma and Srinivasa Rao in the Marupaka village of Vemulawada Urban mandal, Karimnagar district, on 31 August 1923. He was the third child and had eight sisters and three brothers. According to his autobiography, he was interested in issues of social justice in Telangana from an early age on and often had the opportunity to observe the discussions of Andhra Mahasabha leaders, Polkampalli Venkatrama Rao and Baddam Yella Reddy, particularly when its fourth conference was held in Sircilla in 1935. Influenced by this movement he later came into contact with Marxist ideology. In 1942, he joined the Communist Party of India and in 1944 became regular member of the party. Rajeshwara Rao attended Karimnagar High School till 1943 and subsequently entered Osmania University to become a lawyer. = Student years = Rajeshwara Rao was part of the Osmania University Students Union and the All Hyderabad Students Union. During his student years, Rajeshwara Rao worked as a student organizer and went on to become a leader of the Osmania University Students Union. He participated in the railway strike. He graduated in 1947, B.Sc. and left University as part of the Quit College Movement to actively participate in the ongoing Freedom struggle, he later completed his LL.B. in 1963.  Freedom struggle  As a student Rajeshwara Rao joined the Telangana Armed Struggle against Nizam of Hyderabad and actively participated in Freedom Movement of India. He worked under veteran Telangana Armed Struggle leader Ravi Narayana Reddy. Due to his active participation in the Telangana Rebellion against the ruling Nizam of Hyderabad, Rajeshwara Rao lived underground from September 1947 till October 1951 when he was arrested under the Preventive Detention Act (PDA). In this period of underground and jail life, Rajeshwara Rao, his wife Lalitha, their two daughters Aruna and Kalpana, both born in this period, and his brother Ch. Hanumantha Rao faced severe hardships. Rajeshwara Rao worked closely with famous Urdu poet Makhdoom Mohiuddin when they all lived in underground dens in Sabzeemandi and chikkadpally, before being arrested. While underground, he organised different student actions, like hosting the Indian flag on Independence day, 15 August as well as the training of students for the armed struggle of Telangana. In 1948, he got elected General Secretary of the AHSU in a secret meeting and led a delegation to the South East Asian Youth Conference in Kolkata the same year. He also attended the second congress of the CPI in Calcutta in 1948. After he was released on parole in February 1952, Rajeshwara Rao advocated the implementation of the Tenancy and Land Reform legislation and was soon rearrested. Only after the ruling of the Indian Supreme Court declaring the PDA unconstitutional, Rajeshwara Rao was ultimately freed months later. He served as the Acting District Secretary of the CPI till 1956 and subsequently got elected D.C. Secretary.  Political career  Rajeshwara Rao was active in movements like the Andhra Mahasabha, during the Telangana Armed Struggle, as a farmers organizer (Kisan), and later as a long time legislator. Highly influenced by leaders like Anabheri Prabhakara Rao and Singireddy Bhupathi Reddy in Karimnagar district, Rajeshwara Rao worked with tenants and landless against the feudal system of the Nizam. He supported the implementation of land and tenant reforms and the redistribution of government lands in the last decade of the 1940s and beginning of the 1950s. Rajeshwara Rao highlights in his autobiography the close work with Baddam Yella Reddy, Amritlal Shukla, K.V.Damodhara Rao, Eleti Raji Reddy, Joginipalli Ananda Rao, Polasani Chokka Rao, Mukund Lal Mishra, Baddam Malla Reddy, Japa Laxma Reddy, Ch. Venkat Rama Rao, Desini Mallayya, Annaboina Mallayya, Poodari Yellaiah, L. Muttayya, S. Nambaiah, Thakur Raja Ram Singh, Shyam Sunder Singh and many others. Rajeshwara Rao could not contest the first general elections held in February 1952 because he was released from jail on the last date of nomination and could not reach Metpalli, where he was supposed to contest on behalf of People's Democratic Front - a proxy for the Communist Party of India which was still banned at this time. In 1957, Rajeshwara Rao was elected to the first Legislative Assembly of Andhra Pradesh from the Choppadandi constituency. Throughout his career as a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA), he served the Karimnagar district and got re-elected five times from Sircilla and once from Choppadandi in the following years. He worked as Chief Whip of the CPI in the state parliament between 1957 and 1962 and then returned to university to finish his law degree in 1963. In the following three years he practised law in the Karimnagar District Court before re-entering the Legislative Assembly in 1967 and working as the CPI floor leader till 1972. He also served as a member of the CPI central committee for several years.Rajeshwara Rao, election rally of the Communist Party of India (~1957) Rajeshwara Rao was President of the Freedom Fighters Steering Committee appointed by the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India, from 1996 to 1998 and was instrumental in achieving pensions for freedom fighters of the Telangana Rebellion. Despite being one of the founding stalwarts of the Communist Movement in Telangana, in 1999, he sent a shockwave in political circles by snapping decades old relations with CPI and joined Telugu Desam Party (TDP) led by Chandra Babu Naidu. Rajeshwara Rao lost the subsequent elections in 1999 but got elected as an TDP MLA in 2004. After serving the term he retired in 2009. After leaving the CPI, Rajeshwara Rao continued to work through an NGO, the Self Employed Welfare Society (SEWS) with a number of projects supported by the German government, the European Union and Andhra Pradesh government. He was also working for the Freedom Fighters’ Organization, of which he was president until his demise. Rajeshwara Rao along with Devender Goud and others was instrumental in the TDP to convince Chandrababu Naidu to adopt separate Telangana resolution in TDP Mahanadu in May 2008. However, due to Naidu's reluctance Devender Goud quit the TDP. After Rajeshwara Rao's retirement from active politics at the age of 87, his son Ch Ramesh was elected in 2009 to the assembly as a candidate of TDP/TRS alliance. = Legislative work = Rajeshwara Rao's 30-year legislative career started in 1957 when he was elected as an MLA and became Chief Whip of the Communist Party, while Puchalapalli Sundarayya was the leader and Ravi Narayana Reddy and Arutla Kamala Devi were Deputy Leaders. Due to Rajeshwara Rao, his main concern was to serve the poor population of Telangana throughout his career. Besides supporting extensive land reforms he implemented a rural development program in Sircilla to electrify 175 villages by establishing a Cooperative Electric Supply Society (CESS) in the course of 5 years. He initiated the Mula Vagu (Nimmapalli) irrigation Project for the benefit of dry land farmers. He promoted education, upgraded schools and opened new colleges and a polytechnic and degree college in Siricilla. The policies also brought a 50% power subsidy to all powerloom weavers of Siricilla region. He contributed to the report of the backward class commission. = Criticism = Rajeshwara Rao moved a motion of privilege in the AP assembly against C. Rajagopalachari, the then CM of Madras, for his un-parliamentary remarks about communists. This notice was admitted by the speaker of the house and a notice was issued to the CM of Madras, upon which the CM regretted his remarks. Rajeshwara Rao has very openly expressed his serious concern about the quality and calibre of the people's representatives when compared to earlier decades. He argued that people with ability and capacity stay away from politics, while people with vested interests are very much interested to acquire political power. Moreover, he thinks that the membership of a party must be based on the actual contribution of the person to the service of the people. Besides the criticism Rajeshwara Rao faced when he objected to his own party's line, he also spurred controversy for leaving the CPI and for his remarks that the founder of the TDP, N.T. Rama Rao should be hanged for ignoring the development of Andhra Pradesh.  Family  In May 1944, Rajeshwara Rao married Smt. Lalita Devi, they have four children, Aruna, Kalpana, Prabha and Ramesh.The Chennamaneni family represents a unique combination of different political ideologies. Rajeshwara Rao was a staunch communist, freedom fighter and a proven parliamentarian, while one of his brothers, the renowned economist Ch. Hanumantha Rao, is a nehruvian socialist and served as a member of the National Planning Commission under Rajiv Gandhi led Congress Government. Whereas another brother Ch. Venkateshwar Rao is a social worker. His youngest brother is Ch. Vidyasagar Rao, member of the BJP and presently the governor of Maharashtra. Rajeshwara Rao's son, Ch. Rameshbabu serves as a MLA and his nephew (sister's son), B. Vinod Kumar is a Member of Parliament; both of them belong to the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS).

It split from the Communist Party of Canada-aligned Communist Party of Quebec (PCQ-PCC) in 2005 at a national convention on the question of Quebec independence. From 2006 to 30 July 2012, the Chief Electoral Officer of Quebec authorized a provincial political party led by André Parizeau to use the name \\"Parti communiste du Québec\\". However, this authorization was withdrawn because the party no longer had one hundred card-carrying members. In 2014 the party left Québec solidaire and now supports the Parti Québécois.  The split in the PCQ  The Union des forces progressistes (UFP) agreed to place the question of Quebec independence as intertwined with social or class issues. This was hotly debated as the party transformed into Québec solidaire. The debate moved over into the PCQ as well. These positions were questioned by the provincial leader of the party, André Parizeau, who formulated a series of amendments in support of immediate independence in 2004 which were rejected by both the provincial National Executive Committee (NEC) (by a vote of 4–2) and the federal Central Executive Committee (by a vote of 7–1). In January 2005, Parizeau wrote a letter to PCQ members declaring that the party was in crisis and, describing the four NEC members who opposed his amendments as a federalist \\"Gang of Four\\", he summarily dismissed them. Although his Quebec nationalist point of view held a majority at the PCQ's convention of April 2005, who was granted voting rights was highly disputed. Parizeau was subsequently expelled by the party. Around the same time, his group announced their withdrawal from the CPC. However, after a dispute where both groups presented documentation under the same name, the official Directeur général des élections du Québec on 3 April 2006, recognized the Parti communiste du Québec led by André Parizeau. The Central Committee of the party, however, affirmed the authority of the previous Quebec National Executive Committee in 18–19 June 2005. The non-registered CPC- aligned PCQ held a new convention which restarted a communist French-language periodical, Clarté, and later opened an office and small reading room, launched an active website, and re-affiliated with Quebec Solidaire as an organized group. They work closely with the youth and student organization, the \\"Ligue de la jeunesse communiste du Quebec\\". = 2007 provincial election = In 2007 the Parti communiste du Québec decided not to run candidates in the provincial election and rather to support those of Quebec Solidaire. It should be specified that, before the split, the PCQ was one of the party- founders of the UFP, interdependent ancestor of Quebec Solidaire. The nationalist PCQ decided to remain active only in order to prevent another new political formation taking its name. Parizeau, executive committee member Francis Gagnon-Bergmann and Jocelyn Parent were candidates for Quebec Solidaire in the districts of Acadie, Blainville and Mirabel. The original PCQ-PCC also participated in the 2007 elections, running three candidates under the banner of Quebec Solidaire, as well as offering its own independent perspective on the election. = 2008 provincial election = Four members of the nationalist PCQ were presented as candidates in the election under the banner of Quebec solidaire; Gagnon-Bergmann in Blainville, Parizeau in Acadie, executive member Sabrina Perreault in Terrebonne and Jean Nicolas Denis in Bellechasse. = 2012 provincial election = The nationalist PCQ lost its certification as the PCQ with the Director of Elections Quebec, and failed to nominate any candidates. It advocated for a united coalition of Quebec Solidaire with the PQ and Option nationale. The original PCQ-PCC again participated in the 2007 election under the banner of Quebec Solidaire, focusing on the campaign of one candidate in Acadie (bumping out the leader of the nationalist PCQ). The PCQ-PCC also presented its own independent perspective on the election and the question of voting and the student struggle. = 2014 provincial election = No members of the PCQ presented themselves in the provincial election under the banner of Quebec Solidaire. The nationalist PCQ broke with Quebec Solidaire shortly after the defeat of the Parti Quebecois in the Quebec provincial election. It advocated for a broad-tent coalition of all nationalist groups moving towards independence. Moreover, it expressed support of Pierre Karl Péladeau in the Parti Quebecois leadership race. = Current status = On 17 July 2012, the Chief Electoral Officer of Québec stated he wished to remove the authorization given to the provincial party led by Parizeau, in agreement with the Election Act, because of its failure to maintain at least 100 qualified electors. The authorization was withdrawn on 30 July 2012. At a congress in September, the nationalist PCQ led by Parizeau indicated it wished to regain the authorization and was actively recruiting to fulfill the requirements. In 2019, Parizeau disavowed the PCQ in order to be accepted as a candidate for the Bloc Québécois in the 2019 federal election. = Spokespersons = * André Parizeau (2004–2008) * Francis Gagnon-Bergmann (2008–2011) * André Parizeau (2011–2012) * Guy Roy and Gabriel Proulx (2012–present)  References   External links  * * Regarding the other \\"PCQ\\" — statement by Parizeau on the split * Nationalist attempt to control PCQ defeated — CPC statement on the split * La Voix du Peuple — the PCQ's former newspaper Category:Political parties established in 2005 Category:Provincial political parties in Quebec Category:Organizations based in Montreal Category:2005 establishments in Quebec Category:Quebec sovereigntists ","title":"Parti communiste du Québec (sovereigntist)"},{"id":"50511514","text":"Pal Qadiam is a medium size village in Phillaur tehsil of Jalandhar District of Punjab State, India.

The latest entry into the Civilization series, it was released on Microsoft Windows and macOS in October 2016, with later ports for Linux in February 2017, iOS in December 2017, Nintendo Switch in November 2018, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in November 2019 and Android in 2020. Similar to previous installments, the goal for the player is to develop a civilization from an early settlement through many millennia to become a world power and achieve one of several victory conditions, such as through military domination, technological superiority, or cultural influence, over the other human and computer-controlled opponents. Players do this by exploring the world, founding new cities, building city improvements, deploying military troops to attack and defend from others, researching new technologies and cultural civics, and engaging in trade and negotiations with other world leaders. The game featured several civilizations not featured in previous incarnations of Civilization, while many returning civilizations had new capitals or new leaders. A critical design focus was to avoid having the player follow a pre-set path of improvements towards their civilization which they had observed from earlier games. Civilization VI places more emphasis on the terrain by \\"unstacking\\" city districts from the main city tile and giving bonuses for placing districts near certain terrain types. Other new features include research on the game's technology tree based on nearby terrain, a similar technology tree for cultural improvements and a better government civics structure for those playing on a cultural victory path, and new artificial intelligence mechanics for computer-controlled opponents that include secret goals and randomized engagements to disrupt an otherwise stable game. The game's first major expansion, Civilization VI: Rise and Fall, was released in February 2018, a second expansion, Civilization VI: Gathering Storm, followed in February 2019 and a season pass, The New Frontier Pass, in May 2020. Gameplay Civilization VI is a turn-based strategy video game in which one or more players compete alongside computer-controlled AI opponents to grow their individual civilization from a small tribe to control of the entire planet across several periods of development. This can be accomplished by achieving one of several victory conditions, all based on the 4X gameplay elements, \\"eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate\\". Players found cities, gather nearby resources to build and expand them by adding various city improvements, and build military units to explore and attack opposing forces, while managing the technology development, culture, and government civics for their civilization and their diplomatic relationships with the other opponents. currently unobserved by the player. Civilization VI builds upon the general gameplay of Civilization V, including continuing the use of the hex-based grid introduced in Civilization V. New to Civilization VI is the idea of \\"city unstacking\\": some improvements to cities must be placed in the hexes in the bounds of the city but not within the city's space itself, whereas in previous games, all improvements were considered stacked on the same map hex or square that the city was located in. The player must assign specific hexes as \\"districts\\" in the city, which have certain limitations but grant bonuses for improvements placed in that district. For example, the encampment district specializes a city for training military units, and allows for the construction of further buildings that grant production and experience bonuses to said units. Such encampments may not be placed next to the main city center. Other improvements gain bonuses for being placed in appropriate terrain - campuses benefit greatly from being placed adjacent to forest or jungle hexes, reflecting on scientific advance from studying the diversity of species within such biomes. Players can opt to attack specific districts of a city instead of the city center, which can affect the city's operation. These districts may also add new strategies to the city's defense. For example, with a military encampment in place, attacking forces approaching a city are not only subject to ranged attacks from the city center, but also from the encampment. The attacking forces may need to take the encampment first before they can successfully strike the city center. In order to reduce congestion on the map, players are able to perform a limited amount of unit stacking (a change from Civilization V), but are only able to stack similar unit types or symbiotic units. For example, a warrior unit can be assigned to a builder unit to protect that unit from barbarians in the early game, and a battering ram can stack with a spearman to take over cities. The game's technology tree, now known as the active research system, has also been modified to help boost technology research if the player has access to appropriate improvements or resources (e.g. building a quarry helps boost the research into masonry). Technologies based on access to water, such as sailing, would be limited if the player started in the middle of a continent. A new feature called Eureka Moments is able to increase the player's progress toward certain technologies after completing specific tasks; for example, laying a mine field contributes to the military tradition technology. Past iterations of the game were considered difficult to win if the player decided to pursue a Cultural victory. To balance the game toward Cultural victories, a new Civics tree is introduced. The Civics tree has transferred cultural improvements that were previously part of the Technology tree in earlier Civilization games into a separate mechanic. Culture gained from cities is used to build on the Civics tree in the same manner Science from cities builds up the Technology tree. Completing certain Civics will then unlock policies, or policy cards, for the player's government. In Civilization VI, the government is defined by placing appropriate and available policies into a number of slots divided among Military, Economic, Diplomatic, and Wildcard categories. The policies define boosts or limitations for the civilization (e.g. improved attack bonuses for military units against certain types of enemies such as Barbarians). Policies can be changed for free upon completing a single Civic, or for a small cost at any other time, allowing the player to adapt to a new situation as needed, according to lead producer Dennis Shirk. More advanced cards, only obtainable through significant advancement in the Civics tree, can unlock improvements that give the player pursuing a Cultural victory advantages over other players, such as reducing the time or cost of producing new units. Various choices made by the player may cause unhappiness in their population as with previous games, but in Civilization VI, many of these were localized to the city affected by the choice rather than the entire population, further aiding towards Cultural victory-style players. The Religion system introduced in Civilization Vs Gods & Kings expansion is built further upon in VI, featuring more units and improvements that can lead to interreligious conflicts. AI opponents have new agendas that influence player interactions. Some of these agendas are unique to each leader, emulating notable historical events, respective personalities and policies. Each AI character also has a second hidden agenda, which can only be revealed through espionage. Development The game was developed by the same Firaxis Games team that developed the expansions on Civilization V, and most of the new mechanics introduced in these were present in Civilization VI at its launch. This follows from Sid Meier's \\"33/33/33\\" rule of sequel design: 33% of the game should retain established systems, 33% should feature improved systems over the previous version, and the remaining 33% should feature new material. Firaxis used \\"Frankenstein\\", a small group of dedicated Firaxis fans, to bounce ideas for gameplay improvements. Because of the larger number of systems in place, the studio expected to ship the game with a large-scale tutorial, separate but supplementing the guidance given by the player's various in-game advisors. A major foundation of the development of Civilization VI was to prevent players from following routines in playing through a game, according to lead designer Ed Beach. The developers placed much more emphasis on the significance of the procedurally-generated map in how it would influence the player's strategy as the game progressed, so that no game of Civilization VI would be the same. For example, the redesigned technology tree was aimed to pull players away from automatically following a rote path through the tree, and instead adapt a path through it based on their placement on the map. Modifications to the game such as the unstacking of cities and city districts lead directly to support this approach, since some districts and city improvements depend specifically on what available terrain is nearby. Such changes were also the result of design choices made by Civilization Vs lead designer Jon Schafer during its development, such as the unstacking of player units. These changes in Civilization V exposed other weak areas of the core gameplay of the series, specifically how cities were simply seen as places to dump improvements and Wonders with little effect on the map, according to producer Dennis Shirk. Beach, as lead designer for Civilization VI, wanted to improve upon these weaknesses, desiring to make the game map \\"just as important as anything else in the game\\", and took the step to unstack the cities to accomplish this, following in how Schafer took to unstack unit tiles in Civilization V. According to Beach, these features add city management elements similar to those found in city-building games, and force players to make decisions based on the geographical location of the city, instead of sticking to a specific city improvement route. Because of the importance of the surrounding terrain to the growth of a city, Firaxis had to review their procedural generation for game maps to meet this new approach. Beach noted that early testing with the unstacked cities on archipelagos generated by their older system made gameplay nearly impossible, and that with mountains becoming a valuable resource towards city expansion, test players would restart maps built on the old map generation system to get the right placement of mountains to exploit them successfully. The new map generation system attempts to spread out terrain more, and in areas where one type of important terrain may be absent, makes up for this by including other valuable terrain spaces, such as a river-rich region where there is a lack of mountains. Senior gameplay designer Anton Strenger compared their approach towards the development of the computer opponents, with main and hidden agendas, similar to concepts they had used in Rising Tide expansion for Civilization: Beyond Earth. They selected historical leaders to span a diverse range of faction and playstyle dynamics, while also looking for figures that had \\"really interesting personalities\\" that they could fit these agendas into. Beach previously designed a system in the Civilization V: Brave New World expansion that gave a \\"Mayhem level\\" in the computer opponents. Internally, the game tracked how much action was going on for the players, and if it determined that the player was progressing without little change, the computer would cause one or more of its controlled opponents to make erratic moves, creating a new situation for the player to deal with. The Mayhem level was used in Civilization VI, as according to Shirk, it is a \\"really interesting way of making sure that there's always something that's going to pull the player away from what they're doing or what they're focused on all the time\\". Whereas the process of tuning this for Brave New World required manual playthroughs of the game, Firaxis had set up several computers in their offices to run Civilization VI, using only computer- controlled opponents; the results and behaviors of these games were reviewed by the part of the team dedicated to the artificial intelligence systems and used to balance the Mayhem level. The game was developed with a new engine that is expected to be more friendly to modification. The game's visuals were inspired by the Age of Exploration. User-interface elements feature elements like compasses and astrolabes. The fog of war is rendered using a cross-hatch drawing style to replicate old maps from the Age of Exploration. The developers planned to bring back the movies they had shown players upon completion of a Wonder from Civilization IV, but are now rendered in game, and as to make the final shot of the Wonder more impressive, they developed a day- night cycle that continues on in the game. While this cycle does not affect the core gameplay, art director Brian Busatti anticipates that this feature could be used by modders to create new tactical considerations. The game uses a more cartoonish look than those of Civilization V, as according to Firaxis, with much deeper gameplay, they wanted to keep the visuals simple to avoid interfering with the complexity of gameplay. The graphics of individual units and buildings are being developed to be both readily-detailed when viewed in a tight zoom, while still being recognizable from other similar units when viewed from a distance. This necessitated the simpler art style to allow players to quickly recognize units and buildings while looking over a city without having to resort to user interface tooltips or similar distractions, according to Shirk. Individual units were designed to include flair associated with the given civilization, such as applying different helmet styles to the same class of footsoldier units. Composer Christopher Tin, who wrote \\"Baba Yetu\\", the Grammy-winning theme song for Civilization IV, returned to write Civilization VIs main theme, \\"Sogno di Volare\\" (translated as \\"The Dream of Flight\\"). The theme was written to capture the spirit of exploration not only in \\"seeking new lands, but also the mental exploration of expanding the frontiers of science and philosophy\\". Tin premiered the song at a London concert in July 2016. The game's original score was written and orchestrated primarily by Geoff Knorr, who was assisted by Roland Rizzo, Griffin Cohen, and Phill Boucher. Each civilization features a musical theme or \\"core melody\\" with four variations that follow the era that the civilization is currently in. Sean Bean, who narrated the early trailers of the game, also provided his voicework for quotes read to the player as they progress along the technology and civics tree. In January 2017, the Firaxis team affirmed that they were still working on updates to include multiplayer support, user-created modifications, and support for Steam Workshop. =Expansions= Rise and Fall The first expansion, Rise and Fall, was released on February 8, 2018, and brought the concepts of the rising and falling of civilizations. The cities have loyalty, if the loyalty goes too low, the city becomes a free city and may join other civilizations. A civilization has the potential to enter into a Golden Age by completing certain milestones, and can choose a special bonus in that age, but if the player does not maintain certain milestones afterwards, the civilization could fall into a Dark Age, affecting loyalty. In a Dark Age, the player can choose to implement powerful Dark Age policies, but they have a cost. If the player gets a Dark Age followed by a golden age, instead of getting a golden age, it gets a Heroic Age, with the right of choosing 3 bonuses. The expansion also adds governors, which increase the loyalty of cities and award a special bonus to that city, by promoting governors, you add another bonus to it. Gathering Storm The game's second major expansion, Gathering Storm, was announced in November 2018 and was released on February 14, 2019. The expansion added, among other features, impacts from natural disasters like floods, volcanoes, and droughts that affect gameplay. Additionally, a new climate system was added to track climate change throughout the player's game, with potential for additional environmental effects to result from this. Existing civilizations and leaders were rebalanced to reflect these new gameplay additions respective to each civilization's historical past, such as Egypt being able to take advantage of river flooding for improved food production. Red Death A free update to the game released in September 2019 added a new multiplayer game mode called \\"Red Death\\". This mode is comparable to battle royale games for up to twelve players. Taking place on a post-apocalyptic world, each player controls one civilian unit and multiple offensive units that must protect the civilian unit from the other players, while at the same time, keeping the civilian unit out of range of an expanding \\"red death\\" zone that eventually covers the world map. Meanwhile, these units can also scour the wasteland for resources that help to improve the supporting units. The mode was the result of an April Fools' joke by Bradley Olson, the lead multiplayer gameplayer designer, who secretly added the basics of the mode on April 1. Once the mode was discovered, the project team found the mode to be fun and expanded the idea. New Frontier Firaxis announced in May 2020 a \\"New Frontier\\" season pass for the game, consisting of six total content packs, each to release every other month starting in May through March 2021. A total of nine new leaders and eight new civilizations will be added through the six packs, as well as new gameplay modes and additional features such as new wonders and buildings. There will also be additional free updates to the game for all players along with these content packs. The first expansion featured the Maya and Gran Colombian civilizations, led by Lady Six Sky and Simón Bolívar respectively. The expansion also introduced a new game mode titled \\"Apocalypse.\\" In the Apocalypse game mode, natural disasters happen much more frequently. Once the world's climate change level reaches maximum, the world enters an apocalypse state, causing an even further increase to severe natural disasters and meteor strikes. The second expansion featured the Ethiopian civilization, led by Menelik II, along alternate costumes for Catherine de Medici and Teddy Roosevelt with different abilities, a new district called the Diplomatic Quarter, which gives improvements on diplomacy and espionage and the \\"Secret Societies\\" mode, that allows players to join one of four available secret societies, each with a different hidden agenda, including exclusive traits. The third expansion introduces the Byzantine and Gaulish civilizations, led by Basil II and Ambiorix, respectively; a new map called \\"Highlands\\", and two new world wonders—the Biosphere and Statue of Zeus. The new \\"Dramatic Ages\\" mode abolishes the Normal and Heroic Ages and ensures that players can only enter in Golden or Dark Ages each era, with increased bonuses for the Golden Ages and harsher penalties for Dark Ages, including the possibility of some cities seceding from the empire. In addition, Dedications are also removed from this mode, and instead are replaced by Golden and Dark Age policies that can be slotted in the current government. As compensation for these changes, Era Score can now be earned when discovering new technologies or civics, or through promoting military units (after the unit's first promotion), in addition to the usual Historic Moments, and any extra Era Score acquired beyond what is necessary to earn a Golden Age is converted to extra loyalty pressure during the next era. =Ports= Civilization VI was released for Microsoft Windows on October 21, 2016. The OS X version, developed by Aspyr Media, was released on October 24, 2016. At that time, Aspyr had been evaluating the feasibility of porting the title to Linux operating systems due to a large number of requests from players, and announced in January 2017 that they planned to go ahead and complete the Linux port, which was eventually released in February 2017. A version for iPad was released in December 2017, while a general iOS version (supporting iPhones) was released on October 4, 2018. The Rise & Fall expansion was released for iOS on July 24, 2019, while Gathering Storm was released on November 22, 2019. A port for the Nintendo Switch was announced in September 2018 and was released on November 16, 2018. Cloud saves were added in April 2019 for both Windows and Switch versions through linking of a player's Steam and 2K accounts, though only supported saved games from the base game at that point due to the lack of the expansions on the Switch. Both Rise & Fall and Gathering Storm expansions were available as an expansion bundle for the Switch version on November 22, 2019. PlayStation 4 and Xbox One ports were announced in September 2019. Both were released on November 22, 2019, alongside the Rise and Fall and Gathering Storm expansions as separate and bundled downloadable content. A version for Android was released on August 13, 2020.https://roonby.com/2020/08/16/civilization-vi-finally-comes-to-mobile- devices/ Reception Civilization VI received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" for PC and Nintendo Switch, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Critics like Scott Butterworth from GameSpot praised the game's nuanced additions and the unstacking of cities, which \\"adds a new strategic layer that fills a gap and creates greater variety in the types of thinking Civ demands.\\" IGN's Dan Stapleton echoed the same love for its \\"overwhelming number of systems\\" and for feeling \\"like a Civ game that’s already had two expansions.\\" Peter Glagowski from Destructoid was slightly more critical, dubbing the religious victory condition in the game a \\"nuisance\\" and recommending \\"turning it off\\". He also lamented the lack of scenarios, the scrapping of the diplomatic victory condition (which would eventually be reintroduced in Gathering Storm), and the absence of Steam Workshop support at launch. The game shipped more than one million units in its first two weeks of release, making it the fastest-selling game in the Civilization series to date. By May 2017, the game had sold more than 2 million copies, contributing significantly to publisher Take Two's 2017 financial year which had reported revenues of $576.1 million. Take Two stated that Civilization VI was on track to surpass Civilization Vs lifetime sales of 8 million copies. The game won the Best PC Game and Best Strategy Game awards at the 2016 Game Critics Awards, as well as the Best Strategy Game at The Game Awards 2016 and the National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers. Controversy The game originally shipped with the ad tracking software Red Shell, but this was removed after complaints by players, some of whom characterized the software as spyware. Other media In August 2017, Fantasy Flight Games announced that they would be publishing Civilization: A New Dawn, a board game building upon their 2010 release Civilization: The Board Game, incorporating new mechanics and features based on Civilization VI. It was published in 2017.

Signature Securities Group Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary, is a licensed broker-dealer and investment adviser offering investment, brokerage, asset management, and insurance products and services. As of 2019, the bank had total assets of $53 billion, deposits of $40.3 billion, and loans of $39.1 billion.  History  Signature Bank was founded in 2001. Founders Joseph J. DePaolo, the bank's current president and chief executive officer, Scott A. Shay, chairman of the board, and John Tamberlane, vice chairman and director, conceptualized the idea of a commercial bank that would cater to clients through a distinctive single-point-of-contact approach. This client-centric model focuses on serving the needs of privately owned businesses, their owners, and senior managers, an underserved market overlooked by competitors. Upon inception, the bank began competing against some of the nation's largest too-big-to-fail megabanks by catering to this market niche. This has since become the hallmark of Signature Bank's model and growth as it continues to target and successfully address the needs of this market. The bank completed its initial public offering in March 2004 and began trading on the NASDAQ under the symbol SBNY.

Signature Bank = Chinacast Education Corporation filed a $35,000,000 lawsuit against Signature for fraud, money laundering, and failing to stop transfers of money to a fictitious investment holding company in the British Virgin Islands with no legitimate business purpose. Approximately 3 months after the case was opened, Chinacast Education Corporation dropped the case against the three banks named in the lawsuit – Signature Bank, Bank of China, and HSBC Bank. A voluntary dismissal was approved by Judge Swain and the cases against both Signature Bank and Bank of China were dismissed with prejudice. = West End Financial Advisors LLC Ponzi scheme = In early 2016, some investors filed suit against Signature after the company lost $66 million of investor cash in a Ponzi scheme run by William Landberg, a money manager who pleaded guilty to the crime. They alleged that Signature helped Landberg by ordering him to shift money around dozens of accounts to cover up long-term overdrafts. Landberg was sentenced to three and a half years in federal prison. = Tenant harassment = Signature Bank has been the center of numerous protests due to mistreatment of tenants by landlords who receive loans from the bank. Despite these accusations, the Association for Neighborhood & Housing Development has applauded the bank's commitment to responsible lending practices as it pertains to low and middle income tenants. = Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act = Barney Frank, both a former U.S. congressman (1981–2013) and a member of Signature Bank's board of directors (2015 – Present), voted in favor of raising the Dodd/Frank threshold. He's also gone on record stating “My being on the board has not changed my position on this at all. These efforts began well before I began at Signature Bank.” Signature Bank has provided financial support for re-election races to a number of US Senators for their support of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act, according to Federal Election Commission data tallied by the Center for Responsive Politics. This bill exempted Signature Bank from post-crisis oversight rules. “We find it ridiculous and unacceptable that by virtue of … growing one day past $50bn, we will be burdened with rules intended for the mega 'too big to fail' banks,” Scott Shay, chairman of Signature, said.

Political career In the 1992 general election Cooper contested Hornchurch, coming second to the Conservative incumbent, Robin Squire. Cooper was first elected to Wandsworth Borough Council in 2006, as a Councillor for the Latchmere Ward in Battersea. In 2010, she was elected as a Councillor for the Furzedown Ward in Tooting, re-elected in 2014. When Cooper was selected in 2009 for Furzedown it was a marginal Ward, with Conservative and Labour Councillors. Since 2010, Cooper has enjoyed the largest majority of any Wandsworth Labour Councillor, receiving more than three thousand votes in 2010, 2014 and 2018. In 2008 and 2012, Cooper contested the Merton and Wandsworth Assembly seat, losing on both occasions to Richard Tracey, although achieving an increase in the Labour vote of 5.2% and 7.5% respectively. In May 2016, Cooper defeated the Conservative candidate to become the first Labour representative for Merton and Wandsworth since the establishment of the London Assembly.

The Environment Committee has already produced a number of reports under her leadership, on single-use plastic bottles, on domestic energy and fuel poverty and on parks and open spaces. These were all submitted to the Mayor prior to the launch of the Mayor's draft Environment Strategy in August 2017, and many of their recommendations now feature in it. In addition, the Mayor's draft London Plan refers to both net biodiversity gain and an Urban Greening Factor, both recommendations from Cooper's report on \\"Biodiversity in new housing developments\\". Cooper currently serves as Chair of the London Assembly's Economy Committee, and Deputy Chair of the Environment Committee. She is the London Assembly Labour Group's lead spokesperson on the economy.

Design and construction In the early 1870s, the SFAI needed a locomotive suitable for heavy work on the most important mountain lines, such as the Giovi railway and the Turin-Modane railway, for which the 0-6-0 locomotives were becoming increasingly inadequate. The Ufficio d'Arte di Torino chose a 0-8-0 locomotive of the Wiener Neustädter Lokomotivfabrik (then known as \\"Sigl\\"), very similar to the Südbahn Class 35 a that it already produced.Cornolò, p. 190Kalla- Bishop, p. 31 The Class 420 was a typical long-boiler, inside-frame 0-8-0 locomotive of the era, that showed its Austrian derivation with its two- shutters smokebox door, and its outside Stephenson valve gear. The locomotives built before 1884 had the distinction of having curved footplating over the wheels, while later units had straight footplating and small splashers. Some of the locomotives were given a replacement boiler before 1914, but their performance remained mostly unchanged. The first 60 locomotives were built by Sigl (from which they derived the nickname with which they were known for their whole career) for the SFAI. Production continued until 1890, from both foreign (such as Maffei) and Italian firms (such as Ansaldo and Breda), for a total of 189 locomotives; all these were divided in 1885 between the Rete Adriatica and the Rete Mediterranea. Building of further locomotives for the RM resumed in 1897, and continued until 1905, bringing the total of the Class to 293.Cornolò, p. 190-2 Service The Class 420 served on most Italian mountain lines. The first locomotives were assigned to the Genoa sheds, to serve on the Giovi lines; on the 1-in-62½ grade of the Succursale line (opened in 1889), two Class 420s were able to pull trains of at the speed of 20 km/h. The units assigned to the RM in 1885 were allocated to the Porrettana railway. Their dominance over the major mountain lines began to decline in the 1890s and 1900s, when they were replaced by more powerful locomotives such as the Class 750, and then by the Class 470 locomotives. This caused many members of the class to be assigned to secondary lines of the Po valley, while others were sent to Sicily around 1925 to integrate the similar Class 410 locomotives stationed there. Some units managed to survive World War II, mostly as harbour shunters, and as late as 1953 two Class 420 locomotives were still listed as active in Piedmont. None survived into preservation.Cornolò, p. 190-4 References * * Category:0-8-0 locomotives 420 Category:Breda locomotives Category:Gio.

Plot summary The story revolves around the lives of a City Commissioner, Sathyajith and the eldest daughter of rich couples Madhavan Menon and Bhagyalakshmi, Dr. Nanditha. Both are brought up in the Manimuttam family. Madhavan Menon is the head of the family and a rich business magnate who does care all about his richness and bonding as a successful personality among the family and the public. Niya, the youngest daughter of Madhavan Menon and Bhagyalakshmi, Nanditha and Sathyajith were brought up as siblings but as the time and age passes through, Nanditha and Sathyajith fall in love with each other and dreams out the world after their marriage and waits for that actual moment to present this matter to Madhavan Menon and the family. Charulatha who is in search of her father joins the family. On her way she is chased by some goons and it is headed by Jeevan (Jishin Mohan). However she survives and gets admitted in a hospital but loses her memory after the incident. Sathyan is assigned to investigate the case. During the course of his investigation he comes to know that Charulatha is none other than Menon's daughter whom he had in a pre-marital affair. This disturbs Sathyan heavily and even causes problems between him and Nandu as he is not able to open up it to her. This however annoys her and as a result she makes some mistakes at the hospital adding to their drift. She shares her miseries with her senior doctor and colleague Dr. Abhilash who believes she loves him. Meanwhile, Charulatha regains her memory and Sathyan informs Menon about her. This causes Menon to have a heart attack and he is admitted in the hospital. Sathyajith is suspended as he was not capable to find the culprit behind Charulatha case. After his treatment Menon meets Charulatha and apologises for neglecting her mother as his mother was so adamant of not allowing Prabhavathy (Charulatha's mother) to be her daughter in law. From there he tries his best to provide Charulatha with love and affection and Sathyan helps him with this. Meanwhile, Sathyan and Nandu patch up, their relationship builds up and they cross all the limits. As fate takes a turn Menon forces Sathyan to marry Charulatha so that he can give his daughter the love she was rejected. Unable to tell him about his love for Nanditha he is in a way emotionally blackmailed by Menon. Nandu however mistakes him to have cheated her as Menon tells everyone that Sathyan wanted to marry Charulatha. While all these Menon and Bhagi decides to get Nandu married off to Dr Abhilash as they mistake them to be in love. They fix their marriage without her knowledge. Nandu who is pregnant with Sathyan's child is helpless and by situations is forced to marry Abhilash on the same day Sathyan and Charulatha gets married. Sathyan with still Nandu in his heart denies a marital relationship with Charulatha which makes her sad. Nandu is also hesitant in starting a marital relationship with Abhilash and lives in the fear of getting caught. After a few days Abhilash comes to know about her pregnancy via her friend who is a doctor. This hurts and angers Abhilash and he rages out at Nandu who apologises to him. He however covers this truth as he doesn't want to hurt his mother and sister who believes it's his child. (Although this is his reasoning from his characterisation it is evident that he doesn't want to let go of Nandu as he loves her ardently). Despite of all these Abhilash becomes a drunkard and loses concentration in his job. Nandu, who feels guilty and at the same time annoyed of all these, asks him to stop drinking and this becomes a heated argument. Abhilash's sister happen to hear it and this becomes a big problem. Nandu is sent back to her house and is hated by her parents. She happens to hear a conversation between them saying how much unbearable pain and loss of integrity she had caused them. This saddens her greatly and she attempts suicide. But she is saved on time by Sathyan who feels extremely guilty for all these. Nanditha survives only to realise that Menon (her father) has decided to abort the baby and send her back to Abhilash who is ready to accept her. (Menon tries to woo Abhilash by offering him all his wealth but he says he loves Nandu and can accept her without the money). Nanditha objects this as she wants her child. But her objection is neglected by Menon even after Bhagi persists. This breakes Nandu's heart and she leaves the home into ambiguity and loneliness leaving a letter saying she cannot live without her child. All of Sathyan's attempt to find her fails but she ends up in the safe hands of Chinnamachi and Pailichayan, a childless couple. They take care of her like their own daughter and adapts into her new name \\"Indu\\" who was their relative who passed away. Nandu starts a new life there and she goes as the maid to Thottathil Bungalow to support Chinnamachi and Pailichayan. Later she gives birth to a baby girl \\"Kingini mol\\". while all this occur Niya (Nandu's sister) marries Jeevan (who earlier attempted to molest Charulatha). Jeevan (who knows that Charulatha is Menon's daughter) continues blackmail her into satisfying his sexual needs. Helpless Charu decides to end her life but is caught on time by Sathyan. She tells Sathyan everything and Jeevan is arrested much to the anger of Niya (who already hates them for ruining her sister's life). In this anger she reveals to the family that Sathyan is the father of Nandu's child. The whole family leaves him and Charu says that she hates him and would never want to live with him as she complains that he never loved her but only loved Nandu. Menon is paralysed. Sathyan leaves the place asking for a transfer. As a turn of events he gets transferred to where Nandu is living and there he explains to her everything. He asks her to rekindle their relationship and invites her to his life again. Meanwhile, at Manimuttam, Jeevan is released and he acquires all of their property and Niya realises his true colours. Charu decides to return to Sathyan. Charu, who is greedy and selfish threatens Nanditha and wants Sathyan to love her. Sathyan who says that he married her only because of the pressure of Menon and that he loves Nandu and her child. Shamelessly she asks him to have sex with her so that she can be equal to Nanditha. Charu swears at Kingini mol and tries her best to stop Sathyan from interacting with his daughter. She threatens Nandu to never return to Manimuttam and never lets anyone at Manimuttam know about Nandu despite knowing that if Nandu returns they can acquire all their property Jeevan has stolen. She also forces Nanditha to return to Abhilash, who still loves her. She agrees to do so because of Charulatha and also everyone in Manimuttam wants that. She goes to Abhilash's house but his family do not accept her bur they live there. Sathyan is still in love with Nandu and is reluctant to see Charu as his wife. But she begs with Nanditha to tell Sathyan to accept her and because Nandu says that they start a real marital relationship. Meanwhile, Jeevan is thrown out and an arrest warrant is issued with him but he escapes from police custody. Charulatha is now pregnant and she flaunts about it. As a revenge Jeevan kidnaps Charulatha and amidst of Sathyan trying to save her, Charu falls down and her child is aborted. Jeevan is jailed. After the treatment Charu and Manimuttam realises that Charu cannot become a mother anymore because of the fall. Distraught, she tries to commit suicide but is saved. She turns mad and starts seeing Kingini mol as her own child and is treated in a mental asylum. Nandu is forced to give her Kingini mol so that Charu can be cured. Later Charu is cured but her pain still continues. Nanditha gets pregnant again and her family life blossoms with Abhilash, Kingini mol and their expecting child. Charu is jealous of this and asks for Kingini mol, saying that all the struggles Nandu took to bring up Kingini are all the things in the past and that she should be given Kingini mol.

She is best known for her film productions, “Under the Kudzu” (2012) and “Carrie Mae: An American Life” (2015), both of which focus on schools that African American families helped to build during the segregation era. Southern African American families built schools of many different kinds from Reconstruction through the 1950s. Rosenwald schools form the most recognizable part of this school-building movement. Rosenwald schools were schools that African American communities built in partnership with the Julius Rosenwald Fund, which from 1912 to 1932 helped to build almost 5,000 school buildings across the South. For more information about Rosenwald schools, please see Rosenwald School Resources. Claudia received her bachelor's degree in 1988 from St. John's College. In 1992, Claudia graduated with a master's degree from Harvard University Graduate School of Education.

She was also a first-wave feminist. Sources sometimes identify her as Bertha Braunthal-Clark, reflecting her marriage in or before 1933 to the Scottish born communist Willie Norby Clark. Life Braunthal was the eldest of six children born into a Jewish family in Vienna. Her father, Maier Braunthal (1836-1914), originally from Odessa, worked as an accountant. Two of her younger brothers, Julius Braunthal (1891-1972) and Alfred Braunthal (1897-1980) would also grow up to become notable as pioneers of twentieth century socialism. During the First World War she moved to the Netherlands and obtained a clerical job with a manufacturing company. (The Netherlands managed to avoid direct involvement in the First World War.) After that, instead of moving back to what remained of Austria, she took a job in Berlin. Before the war, in Austria, she had been a member of the Social Democratic Party. In 1917 its German equivalent split, primarily over the question of whether or not to continue supporting the government in its determination to continue with the war. Braunthal became a member of the breakaway Independent Social Democratic Party (\\"Unabhängige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / USPD). After the war ended, at the Party Conference which took place at Leipzig in December 1919, she was one of six people elected to the secretariat of the USPD Central Committee. During the later war years she may also have been involved with the Spartacus League. She played a part in the revolutionary turbulence that followed the war, working in Berlin as secretary to the propaganda department of the Greater Berlin Executive Council of the Workers' and Soldiers' Councils. Within the USPD Braunthal was a left winger. From March 1920 she took a leading role on party propaganda work that focused on women. She worked on the party newspaper, Die Kämpferin. As further realignment of the political left approached, in October 1920 she attended the \\"breakup party congress\\" (\\"Spaltungsparteitag\\") in Halle and was elected to the four person Secretariat of the USPD Central Committee. Two months later, at the \\"unification party congress\\" in Berlin, the left wing majority of the USPD agreed to unite with the recently created Communist Party of Germany. Braunthal was elected to the party executive and took over leadership of its Women's Secretariat, a post she retained till 1923, when she was succeeded in the post by Erna Lang. During this period she was working alongside Clara Zetkin, Hertha Sturm and Martha Arendsee editing the party newspaper, Die Kommunistin (\\"The Woman Communist\\"). Braunthal participated at the Second International Communist Women's Conference in June 1921 before travelling on to Moscow to join in at the World Congress of the Communist Third International. As the German communists sustained their reputation for factionalism, during the internal party crisis of 1921 she was part of the left-wing majority on the Party Executive that voted through the expulsion of Paul Levi. In August 1921 at the Seventh Party Conference at Jena, and again at the Eighth Party Conference at Leipzig in January/February 1923, she was re-elected to the Party Executive and mandated to lead the party's Women's Secretariat. Later Bertha Braunthal- Clark and her Scottish born husband worked together on the Comintern newspaper Inprekorr (\\"International Press Correspondence\\") which had been set up in 1921 by Gyula Alpári. It is not clear whether Bertha accompanied Willie Clark when he was working for Inprecor in Vienna in 1929, but he, in any case, relocated to Berlin in 1930. The Nazis took power in January 1933 and lost little time in converting the German state into a one-party dictatorship. Party political activity (unless in support of the Nazi party) became illegal. Willie and Bertha moved to London. They had already been working on creating an English language edition of Inprecor, and now they worked on a weekly newspaper entitled \\"World News and Views\\" which was in effect an English successor to that.Irén Komját: Die Geschichte der Inprekorr. Zeitung der kommunistischen Internationale (1921–1939). Verlag Marxistische Blätter, Frankfurt am Main 1982, p. 50f. While retaining her membership of the exiled German Communist Party, Bertha Clark now also joined its British counterpart. According to one left-leaning source, Willie and Bertha Clarks were subject to constant surveillance by the British security services after they moved to London, and there is certainly a file with their names on it. No source has been located to suggest that they were arrested and detained by the British authorities in 1940, however. After the unexpected dissolution of the Comintern in 1943, Bertha Clark undertook translation work for the British Communist Party. She died in the London quarter of Islington during the early summer of 1968. (Some sources give the year of her death as 1967.)

Democracy or DemoCrazy was published by Candle and Fog Publishing in 2014. This book also published by Createspace Publishing in 2015. Synopsis The government has changed from a monarchy to a democracy by order of a king who had ascended to the throne by succession. While the people have now attained the right to vote, the only candidates are the king's twenty-four sons, who will each serve for terms lasting two years. In the successive reign of each brother, oppression and injustice abound, and they spend their terms feasting, pillaging and plundering the country as much as possible, lining their pockets with enough cash to live out their days in luxury. Each time heading up to the new election, the people take refuge in their wishful thinking that the administration of the “next” prince will make things better. But things never change. The princes had all inherited their grandfather's first name, “Demo” as a prefix to their names. The king had named his twenty-fifth son who was lacking in both appearance, intelligence and character, Demo C’est Assez (meaning Demo “is enough”) but this last prince became known among the people instead as Demo Crazy because of his devious mind and volatile behavior. In an effort to deny any of the twenty-four brothers a second chance at the throne, the people finally decide to vote for prince number twenty-five, Demo Crazy, who is in no way considered qualified for the position. The people actually do not believe that he will win, but they vote for him because they believe that he will most likely be the least brutal, and less of a tyrant than any of the other brothers. Demo Crazy forms a circle of cohorts and enacts his own Demo Crazian principles which consist of a combination of oppression and deception of the masses. He embarks upon a mission to destroy the country, playing off his actions as a “service” to the people. As it turns out, he is really in fact an enemy agent, who after ultimately fleeing his own country and ta king refuge in enemy lands, surrenders his nation to them. The behavior and documented speeches of Demo Crazy are truly astonishing, and even more unusual are the laws and regulations he exercised in ruling over his country. The question of whether or not the standard and conventional democracy in the world today is predicated upon the principles and methods that Demo Crazy carried out in this book is presented only as food for thought and not as a steadfast claim. The answer to this question will be left for the reader to decide. About the Author Seyyed Mahdi Shojaee was born on August 1960 in Tehran. He is famous for his outstanding books on spiritual themes.

It was discovered in 2016 by the Kepler space telescope.1st Alien Earth Still Elusive Despite Huge Exoplanet Haul, Mike Wall, Space.com The exoplanet was found by using the transit method, in which the dimming effect that a planet causes as it crosses in front of its star is measured. Characteristics =Mass, radius and temperature= Kepler-1229b is likely a rocky super-Earth, an exoplanet with a radius and mass bigger than Earth, but smaller than that of the gas giants Neptune and Uranus. It has an equilibrium temperature of . =Host star= The planet orbits a (M-type) star named Kepler-1229, orbited by a total of one planet. The star has a mass of 0.54 and a radius of 0.51 . It has a temperature of 3724 K and is about 3.72 billion years old. In comparison, the Sun is 4.6 billion years old and has a temperature of 5778 K. The star's apparent magnitude, or how bright it appears from Earth's perspective, is 15.474. Therefore, it is too dim to be seen with the naked eye. =Orbit= Kepler-1229b orbits its host star with about 4% of the Sun's luminosity every 86.829 days at a distance of (close to that of Mercury, which orbits at a distance of 0.387 AU).  Habitability  The exoplanet, along with eight others, was announced to be orbiting in the habitable zone of its parent star, the region where, with the correct conditions and atmospheric properties, liquid water may exist on the surface of the planet. Kepler-1229b has a radius of 1.4 , so it is likely rocky. Its host star is a red dwarf, with about half as much mass than the Sun does. As a result, stars like Kepler-1229 have the ability to live up to 50–60 billion years, 5–6 times longer than the Sun will live. The planet is likely tidally locked, with one side of its hemisphere permanently facing towards the star, while the opposite side shrouded in eternal darkness. However, between these two intense areas, there would be a sliver of habitability – called the terminator line, where the temperatures may be suitable (about ) for liquid water to exist. Additionally, a much larger portion of the planet may be habitable if it supports a thick enough atmosphere to transfer heat to the side facing away from the star. Discovery and follow-up studies In 2013, before the two wheels failed, NASA's Kepler spacecraft was completing observing stars on its photometer, the instrument it uses to detect transit events, in which a planet crosses in front of and dims its host star for a brief and near-regular period of time. In this last test, Kepler observed stars in the Kepler Input Catalog, including Kepler-1229; the preliminary light curves were sent to the Kepler science team for analysis, who chose obvious planetary companions from the bunch for follow-up at observatories. The radial velocity observations confirmed that a planetary body was responsible for the dips observed in Kepler-1229's light curve, thus confirming it as a planet. The planet was then announced in the newest catalog released by NASA on May 12, 2016, about 3 years later. At nearly distant, Kepler-1229b is too remote and its star too far for current telescopes or the next generation of planned telescopes to determine its mass or whether it has an atmosphere. The Kepler spacecraft focused on a single small region of the sky but next-generation planet-hunting space telescopes, such as TESS and CHEOPS, will examine nearby stars throughout the sky. Nearby stars with planets can then be studied by the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope and future large ground-based telescopes to analyze atmospheres, determine masses and infer compositions. Additionally the Square Kilometer Array would significantly improve radio observations over the Arecibo Observatory and Green Bank Telescope.

In 1911 he was appointed as a judge to the District of Columbia Municipal Court by President William Howard Taft; he was one of four African-American men appointed to high office and considered his \\"Black Cabinet\\". He was reappointed as judge under succeeding administrations, including that of Democrat Woodrow Wilson. Early life Terrell was born in Orange, Virginia, on November 27, 1857, to parents Harrison and Louisa Ann Terrell. The family moved to Washington, DC in 1865 after the end of the Civil War and emancipation. His father Harrison Terrell worked for prominent businessman George Washington Riggs. Later he served as the personal valet for General Ulysses S. Grant. These connections aided the younger Terrell in his education and later career. Terrell was educated in the public schools of the District of Columbia. He attended the private, preparatory Groton School in Groton, Massachusetts. He was admitted to Harvard University, where he graduated as one of seven Magna Cum Laude scholars in 1884. While teaching for several years at the M Street School in Washington, DC, Terrell studied law at Howard University School of Law, receiving his LL.B. degree in 1889.  Marriage and family  On October 18, 1891, Terrell married Mary Eliza Church. The two met at the Preparatory School for Colored Youth, now known as the M Street High School, in Washington, D.C., where they both were teachers. This was a premier academic high school in a segregated system.  Early career  After graduation from Harvard, from 1884 to 1889, Terrell taught at the M Street High School. He was a participant in the March 5, 1897 meeting to celebrate the memory of leader Frederick Douglass. The group founded the American Negro Academy, led by Alexander Crummell.Seraile, William. Bruce Grit: The Black Nationalist Writings of John Edward Bruce. University of Tennessee Press, 2003, pp. 110–111. From the founding of the organization until his death in 1925, Terrell remained active among the scholars, editors, and activists of this first major African-American learned society. He worked with them to refute racist scholarship, promote black claims to individual, social, and political equality, and publish books and articles on the history and sociology of African-American life.Alfred A. Moss. The American Negro Academy: Voice of the Talented Tenth. Louisiana State University Press, 1981. In 1889, Terrell left the M Street School when he was appointed the chief of division, Office of the Fourth Auditor of the U.S. Treasury Department. In 1896, Terrell began a partnership with John R. Lynch to create the law firm of Lynch and Terrell in Washington D.C. Their firm existed for about two years. They closed it in 1898, when President William McKinley appointed Lynch as \\"a Major and Paymaster of volunteers to serve as such in the Spanish–American War.\\" In 1899, Terrell returned to the M Street High School as principal. He left in 1901 for another federal political appointment.  Municipal Court of the District of Columbia  In 1901, Terrell accepted an appointment to serve as a justice of the peace in Washington D.C.. He was the second African American appointed to this post, following Emanuel D. Molyneaux Hewlett, who served from 1890 to 1906. This marked a difficult time for Terrell and other African-American leaders. Although Republican administrations appointed Terrell and other African Americans to certain high-ranking political positions, they did not work to achieve greater civil rights to all African Americans, especially those millions oppressed in the South by disenfranchisement and Jim Crow laws. In 1911, Terrell was appointed by newly elected President William Howard Taft to the Municipal Court of the District of Columbia. Terrell was one of four African Americans appointed to high office under Taft, and they were known as his \\"Black Cabinet\\". In JSTOR He was reappointed by Taft, Republican President Theodore Roosevelt, and even Democrat Woodrow Wilson.  Howard University Law  In 1911 Terrell also received an appointment as a faculty member at Howard University's School of Law, while still serving as a municipal judge. In February 1911 he became a charter member of the first Washington D.C. chapter of Sigma Pi Phi fraternity, an organization of professional men who were college educated. He continued to teach at Howard until his death in 1925. In 1919, Terrell, along with Henry Lassiter, Lafayette M. Hershaw, Archibald Grimké, and Walter J. Singleton, was a prime mover in the introduction by Congressman Martin B. Madden of a law (H.R. No. 376) to abolish the \\"Jim Crow\\" car in public transportation.\\"Offers Bill To Abolish The \\"Jim Crow\\" Car\\". Washington Bee (Washington, District of Columbia). Saturday, March 8, 1919, p. 3. The Madden Amendment to the Esch–Cummins Act failed.  Last years and death  About four years before his death, Terrell suffered his first stroke. About a year later he had a second stroke, resulting in paralysis on one side of his body. Despite also suffering severe asthma and having declining health, Terrell continued to serve as a municipal court judge. In early December 1925, Terrell's asthma and health began to worsen. He died at his home on December 20, 1925. Legacy and honors Terrell's obituary was featured in The Crisis, the official magazine of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. He is described as \\"a good fellow...tall and healthy to look at; a lover of men, of his social class, of a good story with a Lincoln tang to it.\\" In 1931, Howard University Law School closed its evening classes, during a financial pullback because of the Great Depression. That same year, George A. Parker, Philip W. Thomas, Louis R. Mehlinger, Benjamin Gaskins, Chester Jarvis, and Lafayette M. Hershaw founded the Terrell Law School, named in honor of the judge. It served primarily African-American students, who were prevented from attending local white law schools, and provided evening classes from 1931 to 1950. At that time other law schools began to integrate.\\"Lafayette McKeene Hershaw\\". The Journal of Negro History. Vol. 30, No. 4 (October 1945), pp. 462–464.\\"Robert H.Terrell Law School\\", African American Heritage Trail, Cultural Tourism DC In 1952, the Robert H.

Description  The painting is an oil on canvas with dimensions of 97.5 x 62 centimeters. It is in the collection of the Staatsgalerie Stuttgart, in Stuttgart.  Analysis  The painting is based on a sketch from 1921. It sold at auction in 2011, with a starting price of 7,500 euros, and bought for 13,125 euros. the sketch's size is 45.2 x 34.3 cm. The painting concentric group was created with oil paints on canvas. The work is characterized by a classic symmetry. Schlemmer was influenced by Cubism, but is also used for constructive techniques. Already in 1922, he sketched a fun and colorful puppet, and it combined what he is doing all his life, namely, the desire to portray the figure, which, like a puppet, moves in a given space. Schlemmer is interested not only in the individual and the mental abyss and misery, but also for young people who are geometrically abstract. Schlemmer's work can be seen not only in paintings but also in statues and the performing arts; he was also a sculptor and choreographer, and created a lot of ballet performances. Schlemmer body of work included around 750 paintings, 650 watercolors, 1000 drawings (pencil, ink, Indian ink, pastels, etc.) and about 35 sculptures, as well as 20 scene work. Schlemmer was one of the first Bauhaus masters, who became a victim of the National Socialist regime, as a result, he lost his position of professor, as well as several of his works were destroyed.

Life The fifth son of James King Dean of Raphoe and his wife Anne Walker, he was educated at Eton and matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford in 1777, graduating B.A. in 1781, M.A. in 1784. King became a Home Office law clerk in January 1791. He had the support of William Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville, at that time Home Secretary, and at the end of the year became Permanent Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department. Under Grenville's successor Henry Dundas, King was belonged to the circle gathering government intelligence across departments, including also Richard Ford, Francis Freeling, William Huskisson, Evan Nepean, and William Windham (later Charles William Flint). One surveillance operation in which he was involved was on Alfoxton House in August 1797, where William Wordsworth was staying, and about which James Walsh reported to King because of the presence of John Thelwall, an operation partly prompted by Dr. Daniel Lysons. Windham, a politician rather than an official, used King (an older Christ Church contemporary) as an intermediary with Greville in 1792, when entering a covert role. In 1794 Nepean moved on from the Home Office, leaving King the senior of the Under-Secretaries of State, and he started to plan for a future seat in Parliament. After the passing of the Aliens Act 1793, King also worked in the Alien Office. From an initial task of dealing with correspondence, assigned at the end of 1794, he took on further duties as the Alien Office addressed intelligence needs and countered subversion. In 1798 he became a joint superintendent of aliens, with Flint and Wickham. He stayed at the Home Office until 1806, when Grenville became Prime Minister. In 1806 King was Secretary to the Treasury, with Nicholas Vansittart. This position required that he have a seat in the House of Commons, to act effectively as patronage secretary for Grenville. Enniskillen was the constituency found for him. King, however, was uncomfortable in Parliament; and asked to be moved. He was replaced at the Treasury, and as MP, by William Henry Fremantle, in September of that year. Eased out of Parliament, King became comptroller of army accounts, a post he held for the rest of his life. Legacy King, Ontario was named after King, by John Graves Simcoe.

Land, was the first organized attempt to develop a subscription news and entertainment \\"telephone newspaper\\" service in the United States. Although a number of tests over telephone lines were made throughout Michigan from 1906 to 1908, and the company hoped to eventually expand nationally, it never advanced beyond the exploratory stage. History The Tellevent's name came from a contraction of the phrase: \\"It tells the event to mind's eye.\\"\\"'Televent,' Latest Wonder of Electric Science\\", Detroit Free Press, March 17, 1907, Part Four, page 4. Its main inspiration came from two existing telephone-based subscriber services: the Paris Théâtrophone, which began operation in 1890 and primarily offered live entertainment from local theaters, and the Telefon Hírmondó of Budapest, Hungary, which was established in 1893 and featured a broad range of news and entertainment. It was reported in January 1906 that the Michigan State Telephone Company, which held the state's Bell Telephone franchise, was conducting \\"fairly successful\\" tests in distributing programs \\"between the theatres, the churches, the Light Guard Armory, the new Penobscot Inn and the residences of several officials of the company\\", with hopes that \\"eventually a new use for the telephone will be developed along these lines\\".\\"Theatrophone\\", Michigan State Gazette, January 1906, page 3. The next month, Michigan State Telephone's General Manager, James F. Land, credited as the inventor, reported a \\"most satisfactory\\" test transmitting a church service and concert in Detroit to a party of Grand Rapids people, located 150 miles (240 kilometers) away.\\"New Experiment\\", Sault Sainte Marie (Michigan) Evening News, February 7, 1906, page 2. Additional tests followed, including both the 1906\\"The May Festival by Tellevent\\", Michigan State Gazette, June 1906, page 2. and 1907\\"Detroit Enabled to Hear May Festival Concerts\\", The Michigan Daily, May 11, 1907, page 1. (Reprinted in A Century of Connectivity at the University of Michigan, 2007, page 16.) May Festivals held by Michigan State University in Ann Arbor. Another report stated that two days of Senatorial Caucus speeches 88 miles (141 kilometers) distant at Lansing had been successfully transmitted to multiple Detroit homes.\\"'Tellevent'\\" Experiments a Success\\", Michigan State Gazette, February 1907, page 8. March 1907 saw the formation of the American Tellevent Company, incorporated in Michigan and capitalized at $300,000, with the initial officials of E. L. Ford, W. A. Jackson, George M. Black, Arnold A. Schantz, James H. Swart and James F. Land.\\"The 'Tellevent'\\", Electrical Review, March 23, 1907, page 483. In July 1907, Land resigned as the Michigan State Telephone Company's General Manager, where he had worked for nearly 30 years, in order to spend full-time with the recently founded Michigan Tellevent Company, of which he was the majority stockholder.\\"Michigan State Telephone Company to Have New General Manager\\", Michigan State Gazette, July 1907, page 1. A glowing review in the March 17, 1907 issue of the Detroit Free Press, \\"'Televent,' Latest Wonder of Electric Science\\", described the expansive goals of the Tellevent promoters. The service was designed to use subscriber's existing telephone lines, and had been initially installed in 100 Detroit homes, connecting them with local theaters. However, it was planned that in the future, \\"there will be a televent at the stock exchange, banks, at the band concerts on Belle Isle, race track, club houses, hotels, library, political headquarters, court rooms, in short, wherever the public wishes to go\\". An extensive daily program was also envisioned, starting with \\"Daily News\\" at 7:00 a.m., followed by time blocks featuring additional news, stock, and weather reports, assorted special features, a children's hour, then two hours of dinner music, and closing at 11:00 p.m. with three hours of \\"Grand opera from distant points\\". Subscription costs were estimated to be around $2 a month, with service provided to private homes, businesses, hotels, and hospitals. Also planned was the option to connect to special services, such as ballgames and speeches. Despite the promoters' enthusiasm, it appears that the Tellevent service never went into wider use. Individual reports of test transmissions continued to appear through 1908,\\"Sort of a Magic Carpet\\", Michigan State Gazette, February 1908, page 7. but the Michigan Tellevent Company was dissolved on August 2, 1909.Marvyn Scudder Manual of Extinct or Obsolete Companies, 1930 edition, volume 3, page 944. Later efforts in the United States that had similar goals to the Tellevent included the Wilmington, Delaware Tel-musici, beginning in 1909, a collection of Telephone Herald companies, from 1911 to 1913, and the Chicago Musolaphone in 1913. However, none of these systems achieved financial success, and the idea of using telephone lines for news and entertainment systems would be eclipsed by the development of radio broadcasting in the early 1920s.

Leaks The website was set up in September 2015 and reveals transfer fee, wage and contract information about famous footballers. Its first leak was about third-party agreements between FC Twente and Doyen Sports, which led to the Royal Dutch Football Association banning Twente from European football for three years. Football Leaks also revealed that AS Monaco paid €43 million for Radamel Falcao, rather than around €60 million as had been estimated. In addition, the website revealed that, when Neymar signed for FC Barcelona, he received an €8.5 million signing fee, with a buyout clause of €190 million (£152 million), and that he earns €77,000 a week. A leak revealed that Gareth Bale's transfer from Tottenham Hotspur to Real Madrid was over €100 million, more than the €96 million the club paid for Cristiano Ronaldo. The website also revealed that Ronaldo earned €1.1 million for doing a photoshoot with Mobily. Another leak related to James Rodríguez's transfer from Monaco to Real Madrid for €75 million plus €15 million in additional clauses. In January 2016, it was claimed that Football Leaks was being investigated by the Portuguese authorities over claims of blackmail and extortion. Later in February, Liga de Fútbol Profesional president Javier Tebas blamed FIFA for the leaks of contract details of three La Liga players. In April that year, the website announced that it was temporarily ceasing its leaks. In November 2018, Football Leaks claimed that there had been undercover talks about the creation of a new continental club competition, the European Super League, from 2021.

Some of the information was collected by Football Leaks. The leaks include \\"about 18.6 million documents, including contracts, e-mails and spreadsheets, which served as material for investigative journalism work by 60 journalists from 12 European media.\\" On 5 December, El Mundo revealed a judicial decree from Spanish judge Arturo Zamarriego that prohibits EIC from publishing information until \\"the legal investigation of its obtaining\\".

Barney is an American professor in strategic management at the University of Utah, best known for his contributions to the resource-based theory of competitive advantage. Early life and education Jay Barney was born in Walnut Creek, California on October 8, 1954. He spent his formative years in San Bruno, California and graduated from San Carlos High School in San Carlos, California in 1972. He attended Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah where he majored in Sociology. He graduated from BYU, summa cum laude, in December 1974 and began the Ph.D. program in Sociology at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut in 1976. By 1978, he had created a special joint Ph.D. degree in Sociology and Administrative Sciences at Yale. He finished this degree in 1982. Career Barney joined the faculty at the Anderson Graduate School of Management at UCLA in 1980, moved to the Mays Business School at Texas A&M; University in 1986, to the Fisher College of Business at the Ohio State University in 1994—where he held the Chase Chair for Excellence in Corporate Strategy, and to the Eccles School of Business at the University of Utah in 2012—where he held the rank of Presidential Professor and the Lassonde Chair in Social Entrepreneurship. Barney is best known for his contributions to the resource-based theory of competitive advantage in the field of strategic management Resource-based View. The field of strategic management focuses on explaining why some firms outperform others. Research in this field was changed dramatically with the introduction of concepts from micro- economics by Michael Porter in 1979 and 1908[1] Building on the work of Joe Bain [2], Professor Porter developed tools for analyzing the competitive threats in an industry. Operationalized in his famous \\"five forces framework,\\" Porter's Five Forces Professor Porter's work could be used to explain why firms in some industries outperformed firms in other industries. However, there is often substantial variance in the performance of firms within the same industry. For example, both Walmart and Kmart operate in the discount retail industry, and yet Walmart became one of the largest firms in the world, while at the same time, Kmart struggled with bankruptcy. A theory that used the structure of competition in an industry—such as Professor Porter's theory—had little to say about such intra-industry variation in firm performance. Resource-based theory is designed to address this problem. The main tenets of resource-based theory were developed in a series of articles by Professors Richard Rumelt [3], Birger Wernerfelt [4], Jay Barney [5], and Margie Peteraf [6]. However, the theory grew in popularity and influence when Professor Barney published a paper on the resource-based view in 1991.[7] This paper has become one of the most cited papers in the field of strategic management. The central assumptions of resource-based theory are (1) that firms can vary in their resources and capabilities, and (2) that these differences can last over time. The reason differences in resources and capabilities can be stable often has to do with the nature of some of these resources and capabilities—their path dependence [8], their causal ambiguity [9], their tacitness [10], and so forth. These characteristics of resources and capabilities may create information asymmetries between firms that possess them and those that do not. These information asymmetries may make it costly for firms without certain resources and capabilities to imitate them. In addition, imitation can be costly—even if information asymmetries do not exit—because of these resource characteristics. For example, a disadvantage firm may know, with certainty, that its competitor's success is due to its organizational culture—an example of a socially complex resource of capability—and not be able to change its own culture to imitate this successful culture. Professor Barney's 1991 paper developed a simple framework for distinguishing among several different types of firm performance—i.e., competitive disadvantage, competitive parity, temporary competitive advantage, and sustained competitive advantage competitive advantage—and identified the attributes of resources and capabilities that would make them costly to imitate. This framework has come to be known as the VRIO (Valuable, Rare, Costly to Imitate, and exploited by Organization). Resources that do not increase a firm's revenues or decrease its costs as not valuable, and are a source of competitive disadvantage. Resources that are valuable but not rare are a source of competitive parity. Resources that are valuable and rare can be a source of temporary competitive advantage. Resources that are valuable, rare, and costly to imitate can be a source of sustained competitive advantage. Organization acts like an adjustment factor in this theory—enabling firms that should only have competitive parity to gain high level performance from their resources or leading firms with potentially higher levels of performance to lose that performance because they are poorly organized. Resource-based theory dominated research in the field of strategic management from the early 1990s through 2015. It has also influenced a variety of other fields, including human resource management[12], information technology [13]; supply chain management [14]; and others. In the mid-2000s, Professor Barney worked with Dr. Sharon Alvarez to develop a new theoretical approach to the study of entrepreneurship. Rather than assuming that entrepreneurial opportunities are formed by exogenous shocks to established markets or industries, this approach suggests that opportunities can also be endogenous to entrepreneurial action [15]. By 2015, this \\"creation view\\" of entrepreneurship was beginning to gain traction among entrepreneurship scholars. Research topics that build directly on resource-based theory include The Knowledge based Theory of the Firm, Relational View, Dynamic Capabilities, theories of core competence, and competitive heterogeneity. Barney currently serves as the editor of the Academy of Management Review.

She is considered a pioneer of American abstract photography and a key figure in Bauhaus- influenced photography in Texas. Biography Corpron was born in Blue Earth, Minnesota. Her father, Alexander Corpron, was a doctor, and he moved the family to India, where he served as a medical missionary. She attended a \\"strict English boarding school\\" located in the Himalayan mountains. After spending most of her youth in India, she returned to the United States in 1920 to study art at Michigan State Normal College, where she earned a B.S. in art education in 1925. She went on to study fabric design and art education at Columbia University's Teachers College, gaining her master's degree the following year. Corpron supported herself as an art teacher, first at the Women's College of Alabama (1926–28; now Huntington College) and then at the University of Cincinnati's School of Applied Art (1928–1935). Corpron bought her first camera in 1933. In 1935, she took a job teaching photography, design, and art history at the Texas State College for Women, (currently known as Texas Woman's University) in Denton. She first used a camera to document student artwork. Corpron's teaching and \\"photographic vision\\" had a large influence on the next generation of photographers who brought techniques to Texas that hadn't been seen before. One of her students there was Ida Lansky. Corpron also influenced another Texas avant-garde photographer, Barbara Maples. Of teaching, Corpron said: ″I am one of the fortunate individuals in this world whose vocation and avocation merge. I love teaching above all else, and I have found that as I have developed as a creative photographer, the work of my students has become more interesting.″ She retired from teaching in 1968 and died in Denton in 1988. Photography In the summer of 1936, Corpron decided to refine her photographic techniques at the Art Center in Los Angeles in preparation for teaching a photography course. Her earliest photographic work known as her \\"Nature Studies\\", was a continuation of the experimentation she began in Cincinnati. In work such as the Coral and Starfish (1944) she focused on the abstraction and patterns of natural forms. In works such as, Design with Oil Tank (1942), Corpron would manipulate images to accentuate geometric forms by overlapping negatives. With the support of the art department at Texas Woman's University and her students, Corpron began to further her inventive studies. In 1933, Corpron took up black-and-white photography and was initially interested in it as tool for taking photographs of natural forms for use in textile design courses. Her highly abstract aesthetic was influenced by the photograms of Man Ray and László Moholy-Nagy, who visited Denton in 1942 to teach a light workshop. Around the same time, the artist György Kepes came to Denton to write a book, and he helped expand her repertoire, introducing Corpron to a range of modernist techniques including double exposures and solarization. She is best known for several series that have been termed \\"light-poetry\\" and which she called \\"Light Drawings\\" in which she investigated light as a central subject. She made a number of light paintings by tracking the movement of lights at amusement parks, and another group of images centered on distorted reflections of objects like eggs. There is also a series of images, \\"Light Patterns,\\" made by photographing the play of light on sheets of paper suspended inside a custom- designed box. She also experimented with solarization and with ferrotype plates. Her imaginative and \\"ultramodern\\" investigations of light broke new ground in photographic technique and established her reputation as a pioneer of American abstract photography and a leader of what one scholar has termed the \\"Texas Bauhaus.\\" Kepes became a great admirer of Corpron's work and included some of her photographs in his influential 1944 textbook The Language of Vision. Another admirer of her work in this period was Alfred Stieglitz, who planned to exhibit her work but died before he could do so. During the 1940s and early 1950s, she had a number of solo shows at prestigious museums and galleries and was included in the Museum of Modern Art's \\"Abstraction in Photography\\" exhibition (New York, 1952). In the 1950s, Corpron's production fell off due to ill health and straitened finances. However, in 1975, her work was included in the San Francisco Museum of Art's landmark exhibition \\"Women of Photography: An Historical Survey,\\" which led to a resurgence of interest in her work. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, she was included in exhibitions at a number of museums and galleries, and today her work is held in the collections of MOMA (New York), the Art Institute of Chicago, the Dallas (Texas) Museum of Art, the Museum of Contemporary Photography (Chicago), and other art institutions. Her personal archives are in the collection of the Amon Carter Museum of American Art in Texas.

Early life  Singer was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 1950 to Marjorie and Alex Singer. He attended Yale University, where his professors included William Zinsser, and graduated with a B.A. in 1972.  Career  Singer joined the staff of The New Yorker in 1974. Several of his articles for the magazine were expanded into books, including Funny Money, his account of the collapse of the Penn Square Bank of Oklahoma City; and Citizen K: The Deeply Weird American Journey of Brett Kimberlin. Both Funny Money and Citizen K were praised by The New York Times, with reviewer Ben Yagoda comparing Singer to Joseph Mitchell. Singer's profile of Ricky Jay, an illusionist and scholar, was published in 1993. The article was included in the 2000 anthology Life Stories: Profiles from The New Yorker, edited by David Remnick, and continues to be widely praised, with Manohla Dargis at The New York Times calling it \\"an excellent profile,\\" and Amazon describing it as, \\"a prime example of what The New Yorker does best.\\" Singer is credited with arranging a meeting between Jay and filmmakers Molly Bernstein and Alan Edelstein, whose documentary about Jay, Deceptive Practice: The Mysteries and Mentors of Ricky Jay, was released in 2012. In 1996, Singer was assigned to write a profile of Donald Trump. The article, \\"Trump Solo,\\" was deeply unflattering to Trump — portraying him as vain, boastful, and highly unreliable as a debtor — and began to recirculate in 2015, with the start of Trump's candidacy in the 2016 presidential election. Writing in The Guardian, columnist Oliver Burkeman called it \\"a characteristically excellent profile.\\" In 2005, \\"Trump Solo\\" was republished in Character Studies, an anthology of Singer's work. The book was received favorably by The New York Times Book Review, with reviewer Jeff MacGregor calling Singer \\"a terrific reporter, with a receptive ear for dialogue and a painter's eye for the salient detail.\\" In response to the review in the Times, Trump wrote a letter to the editor, in which he called Singer a \\"loser\\" who \\"was not born with great writing ability.\\" After reading the letter to the editor, Singer sent Trump a thank you note, ironically noting the added publicity Trump had drawn to Character Studies, and enclosing a check for $37.82 as a token of his \\"enormous gratitude,\\" adding, \\"You're special to me.\\" Trump sent the letter back, with the handwritten message, ”MARK—YOU ARE A TOTAL LOSER—AND YOUR BOOK (AND WRITINGS) SUCKS! BEST WISHES DONALD P.S. AND I HEAR IT IS SELLING BADLY.” In 2016, Singer expanded “Trump Solo” into a book, titled Trump and Me, which included present-day reflections on Trump's presidential campaign. It was reviewed favorably by the Daily Telegraph, with reviewer Stephen Robinson writing that the book \\"offers clearer insight into the mind of the presumptive Republican nominee than any of the detailed biographies written over the years.\\" In the Guardian, Hari Kunzru called it, \\"a viciously entertaining demolition of the branding savant with the peach pompadour.\\" In July 2017, Singer wrote a web column about efforts by the 115th United States Congress to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, including thoughts on his own history of treatment for autoimmune disease. The column, written in anticipation of a crucial vote on the repeal by Senator John McCain, was believed by many to have had a decisive effect on McCain's decision-making, with opinion writer Larry O'Connell calling it \\"tailor-made\\" for the senator.

A Democrat, he currently serves as a member of the Florida House of Representatives from District 49, which covers the University of Central Florida area. A native of Fort Lauderdale, Smith is the first openly LGBT Latin person elected to the Florida Legislature.  Early life  Smith was born in Florida to parents who immigrated to South Florida from Canada in 1979. His mother being from Canada, and father from Peru, Smith was the first member of his family to be born in the United States.Carlos Guillermo Smith for Florida House 49 official campaign website Smith attended Spanish River High School in Boca Raton, FL, where he graduated in 1999. In 2003, he graduated from the University of Central Florida with a degree in business administration. Following graduation, he worked for eight years and became manager of Men's Wearhouse stores in Florida and Georgia.  Early political career  In 2011, Smith was hired as a legislative aide for Florida House Representative Scott Randolph. He then served as communications director and senior advisor to Joe Saunders during his successful 2012 bid for the Florida House of Representatives in the 49th district. From 2012–2014, Smith served as Saunders' policy chief and ran his legislative office. In 2013, he was elected chairman of the Orange County Democratic Party. He resigned his chairmanship of the Orange County Democratic Party in the summer of 2015 to focus on his bid for the seat Randolph and Saunders had held before him. = Equality Florida = Smith was employed by political advocacy group Equality Florida as its governmental affairs manager from January 2015-November 2016. While holding the position, he worked on behalf of Equality Florida at the Florida Capitol to compromise with Republican lawmakers on the issue of the controversial HB 43, also known as the Pastor Protection Act, which reinforces that churches and religious clergy can legally refuse to participate in same-sex marriages. Smith secured a success for Equality Florida by reaching agreement with Republican lawmakers that the law would not be expanded to allow private businesses to refuse service to members of the LGBT community, essentially neutralizing the bill. Smith has also advocated on behalf of Equality Florida for the passage of a non- discrimination bill in Florida to protect LGBT individuals in areas of housing, employment, and public accommodations. = 2016 Florida House of Representatives campaign = On June 1, 2015, Smith announced his candidacy for the 49th district seat in the Florida House of Representatives. He ran to take back the seat for Democrats from Republican representative Rene Plasencia. Plasencia, who had won the district in an upset over Joe Saunders in 2014, chose to run in the neighboring 50th district, which leans more Republican. On May 3, Smith officially qualified to be on the ballot by collecting the required number of petitions. At one point, Smith faced two opponents for the seat: Republican candidate Amber Mariano and a no party affiliation candidate, Shea Silverman. Shortly before the qualifying deadline, however, Mariano moved her campaign to the 36th district, leaving Smith without a Republican opponent. Mariano went on to win election in her new district. Over the course of his 2016 campaign, Smith received endorsements from prominent progressive politicians, organizations, and unions, including Minnesota Congressman Keith Ellison, Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer, former Florida House Representative Joe Saunders, St. Petersburg Mayor Rick Kriseman, and the Florida Professional Firefighters State Association. During the campaign, Smith gained national media attention for his advocacy concerning the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, which occurred during Latin Night at Pulse Nightclub. Smith, who had attended the club in the past, felt personally shocked and targeted by the attack, the victims of which were mostly Latino and LGBT. He helped to organize vigils in the wake of the tragedy and spoke to media as part of his position with Equality Florida. For his work, he was included in Out Magazine's Out 100 as one of the \\"Survivors and Heroes of Pulse.\\" Despite lacking a Republican opponent, Smith raised more than $150,000 for his campaignFlorida Division of Elections campaign contributions search and went on to defeat Silverman with 69 percent of the vote.Florida Division of Elections official 2016 election results Smith supported Senator Bernie Sanders in his 2016 presidential campaign.

Despite being part of a small Democratic minority in the House, Smith filed several ambitious pieces of legislation and has advocated aggressively on a series of progressive issues.Sponsored Bills of Representative Carlos Guillermo Smithon the Florida House of Representatives website = Elections = In 2016, Smith first won election to the seat with 69 percent of the vote, defeating no party affiliation candidate Shea Silverman, who garnered 31 percent. Smith had no Republican opponent. In his 2018 re-election campaign, Smith received 64 percent of the vote, beating Republican challenger Ben Griffin by an almost 2-to-1 margin. = Legislative Progressive Caucus = In April 2017, Smith formed and was subsequently elected chair of the Florida Legislative Progressive Caucus. Modeled on the Congressional Progressive Caucus, the group aims to serve as a voice for the progressive left in Tallahassee and advocate for social and economic justice, civil rights, and environmental protection. = Issues =  Gun Control  For the 2017 legislative session, Smith filed a bill to ban the sale, transfer, and possession of assault weapons and large-capacity magazines. Largely motivated by the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, Smith has advocated fiercely for the restrictions, arguing at a January 2017 press conference that \\"the people killed by gun violence every day have rights too. The families and victims who will never be made whole have rights. They were stolen from them by a person armed with hate and with these weapons. So long as criminals and madmen have access to these guns, we are not safe. The time for talk is over.\\" The bill died in committee without receiving a hearing. Smith re-filed his assault weapons ban for the 2018 legislative session just days after the 2017 Las Vegas Shooting, in which a lone gunman killed 58 people and caused 851 injuries. After the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in February 2018, Smith renewed his advocacy to enact a ban on assault weapons and high capacity magazines. On February 20, less than a week after the massacre that killed 14 high school students and three teachers, Florida Representative Kionne McGhee moved to withdraw Smith's bill that would ban assault weapons from its committees and immediately consider it on the floor. The motion failed, 36–71, along party lines. Students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School watched the motion fail from the House chamber's viewing gallery. Later that day, Smith pointedly questioned Representative Ross Spano on the floor regarding Spano's resolution declaring pornography a \\"health risk.\\" In an attempt to question Spano's priorities, Smith asked Spano if pornography had ever physically handicapped a person, or if it had caused PTSD in first responders. Smith asked, \\"Do you believe that identifying porn as a public health risk is more important than identifying gun violence as a public health risk, especially after the events of this week and the events of June 12, 2016, when 49 people were murdered by gun violence at Pulse?\\" Spano is the chair of the Criminal Justice Subcommittee in the Florida House of Representatives, the first committee to which Smith's assault weapons ban was assigned. Spano had the power to schedule the bill for a hearing in his committee during the 2017 and 2018 lawmaking sessions, but declined to do so. On February 21, Smith spoke at a gun control rally of more than 3,000 people at the Florida Capitol. More than 100 students from Stoneman Douglas attended the event. Smith said of the 17 Parkland victims, \\"They may have lost their voices, but you haven't lost yours. You are their voices now, and we're going to work together to make sure this never happens again.\\" Smith criticized school safety plans proposed by Florida Governor Rick Scott and Republican legislative leadership to address the shooting, accusing them of trying to \\"reinvest in the same system that failed them at every single level ... what we need to be focusing on is gun safety. That is absolutely the issue.\\" Smith attempted to amend the House school safety plan to include his assault weapons ban, but the Republican majority rejected his amendment. Smith would eventually vote against the Republican school safety bill, claiming that it did not go far enough. He also cited concerns over provisions in the bill that would allow Florida counties to arm certain school personnel, which he called \\"toxic.\\" After an eight-hour debate, the bill passed the House 67–50. Although most Republican House members supported the legislation, enough opposed it that the House could not have approved the proposal without the support of at least one Democrat. Ten Democrats, many of them representing areas of Broward County and South Florida near Parkland, supported the legislation, giving Republican leadership the votes they needed to pass the plan. On March 9, Florida Governor Rick Scott signed the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act into law.https://www.flgov.com/2018/03/09/gov-rick-scott-signs-marjory-stoneman- douglas-high-school-public-safety-act/  Education  In 2017 and 2018, Smith proposed an overhaul to the Florida Bright Futures Scholarship Program, saying that \\"we have seen enough cuts to education in this legislature. The time is now to reinvest and expand the Bright Futures scholarship to make good on Florida’s commitment to affordable college for everyone.” In 2008, Bright Futures provided scholarships to 39% of Florida high school graduates. By 2015, it covered only 20%. Smith's legislation, titled the \\"Restore Our Bright Futures Act,\\" proposed the following changes: * Expansion of the top tier of the scholarship, the Academic Scholars award, to cover 100% of tuition * Expansion of the second tier of the scholarship, the Medallion Scholars award, to cover 75% of tuition * A $200 to $300 stipend for textbooks * Allowing the scholarship to be used for summer enrollment * Lowering standardized testing cutoffs to expand access to the scholarship Although Smith's bill did not pass during the 2017 session, several provisions from it were included in the 2017-2018 budget. For the 2018 legislative session, Senate Bill 4 - which would permanently write most of Smith's proposed changes into statute - is one of Senate President Joe Negron's top priorities.  Cannabis  Smith has been an outspoken advocate for the medical and recreational use of cannabis. He supported Amendment 2, a proposed constitutional amendment to legalize medical marijuana, in 2016. The initiative passed overwhelmingly, forcing the Florida Legislature to implement the constitutional changes. Smith spoke out against the implementing legislation favored by Republicans, which banned smokeable cannabis and instead limited its use to oils and vape pens. Smith asked pointedly on the House floor, \\"Who are we to tell legitimate patients that they can't smoke their cannabis? That's not our business, members. It's not our business to infringe upon their personal freedoms. It's not our business to infringe on the sacred patient-doctor relationship.\\" In 2017 and 2018, Smith introduced a bill to decriminalize marijuana, making personal-use possession a civil offense rather than a criminal offense, taking jail time off the table for marijuana possession. The Senate version of Smith's bill was heard in committee in 2017, but made no further headway. \\"It's time for Florida to stop arresting 39,706 Floridians a year just for smoking weed,\\" Smith said in a 2018 tweet.  Immigration  Smith has advocated for protections for undocumented immigrants, including the Florida Trust Act, which he has sponsored in the 2017 and 2018 legislative sessions. This bill would bar law enforcement officers in Florida from complying with detainer requests from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, making it harder for federal immigration authorities to deport undocumented immigrants living in Florida. Smith has also vocally opposed immigration legislation introduced by House Republicans that would essentially do the opposite by requiring law enforcement to comply with immigration officials. In a January 2018 TV advertisement, Speaker of the Florida House Richard Corcoran illicitly criticized Smith for introducing the Trust Act, saying, \\"incredibly, some Tallahassee politicians want to make Florida a sanctuary state.\\" Corcoran mentioned Smith's bill several times during a February 13 immigration debate with Tallahassee mayor and Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum, prodding Gillum as to whether or not he supported the legislation. The Sun- Sentinel named Smith the winner of the debate due to the frequent discussion of his proposed policy.  Animal Rights  Smith has fought to improve conditions for racing greyhounds in Florida, filing legislation in 2017 to ban the use of anabolic steroids in the industry. Florida is one of the few places in the United States where greyhound racing persists, and the use of steroids in racing dogs has caused adverse effects such as increased aggression and the development of male sex organs in female dogs. Smith's bill passed the House overwhelmingly, but failed in the Senate. Smith has re-filed the bill for the 2018 session.  Healthcare  In 2017, Smith secured $2.5 million in funding for UCF RESTORES, a PTSD clinic located on the campus of the University of Central Florida. The center provides state-of-the-art virtual reality immersion therapy to help veterans and first responders with PTSD to overcome the disorder. Smith is seeking another $2 million for the clinic in 2018. For the 2018 session, Smith co-sponsored a bill that would create a statewide single-payer health insurance program in Florida. In February 2018, after learning that health insurance provided to employees by Florida-based supermarket Publix didn't cover PrEP HIV prevention medication, Smith met with Publix officials to express his concerns. The next day, Publix reversed the policy and announced the inclusion of the treatment in its employee health insurance. Smith proclaimed the decision as a \\"huge victory\\" for the LGBT community. \\"I think they know and understand that this is the right thing to do for their employees,\\" Smith said. = Committee Assignments = * Government Accountability Committee * Higher Education Appropriations Committee * Joint Select Committee on Collective Bargaining * Local, Federal & Veterans Affairs Subcommittee * Post-Secondary Education Subcommittee  Awards  * Elizabeth Taylor Legislative Leadership Award 2018 * Orlando Diversity Awards - \\"Champion of Equality,\\" 2018 * American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), Leadership and Commitment to Animal Welfare Award, 2017 * Florida Association of Counties (FAC), County Champion Award, 2017 * Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR Florida), Bravery and Fighting for Justice Award, 2017 * Democratic Women's Club of Florida, Inc., Legislative Advocacy Award, 2017 * Florida Education Association (FEA), Freshman Legislator Friend of Public Education Award, 2017 * Florida Young Democrats, Florida Democrat of the Year, 2017 * Hispanic Federation, Trailblazer Award, 2017 * League of Women Voters of Florida, Making Democracy Work Award, 2017 * Metropolitan Business Association, Community Champion of the Year, 2017 * Mi Familia Vota, Esperanza Award, 2017 * Victory Institute, Tammy Baldwin Breakthrough Award, 2017 * Florida Education Association (FEA), Human and Civil Rights Leadership Award, 2016 * Florida Young Democrats, Advocate of the Year, 2016 * Out Magazine, OUT100's Survivors and Heroes of Pulse, 2016 * Watermark, Most Remarkable Person, 2015  See also  * Florida House of Representatives References External links *Representative Carlos Guillermo Smith Florida House of Representatives website *Carlos Guillermo Smith for Florida House 49 official campaign website * Employee profile at Equality Florida * * Category:1980 births Category:Living people Category:American people of Canadian descent Category:American people of Peruvian descent Category:American activists Category:LGBT rights activists from the United States Category:Florida Democrats Category:LGBT state legislators in Florida Category:Members of the Florida House of Representatives Category:Gay politicians Category:21st-century American politicians ","title":"Carlos Guillermo Smith"},{"id":"50513271","text":"John Fulton (31 March 1849 - 11 November 1908) was a New Zealand cricketer.

As the daughter of George Washington Julian and the granddaughter of Joshua Reed Giddings, both of whom were abolitionists and members of the U.S. Congress, Clarke's family exposed her to social reform issues at an early age. She is credited with reviving the women's suffrage movement in Indiana, where she was especially active in the national campaign for women's suffrage in the early twentieth century. She is best known for founding and leading the Indiana State Federation of Women's Clubs, the Legislative Council, and the Women's Franchise League of Indiana (an affiliate of the National American Woman Suffrage Association and the predecessor to the League of Women Voters of Indiana). Clarke was the author of three books related to her father's life, and was a columnist for the Indianapolis Star from 1911 to 1929. Early life and education Grace Giddings Julian was born on September 11, 1865, in Centerville, Wayne County, Indiana. She was the first of two children and the only daughter of George Washington Julian and his second wife, Laura Giddings Julian. Grace also had three older half-brothers. Her father, whose family came to Irvington, Indiana from North Carolina, was an abolitionist, a U.S. congressman, and a social reformer who introduced the first federal suffrage amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1868.Grace Julian Clarke Papers, Rare Books and Manuscripts, Indiana State Library http://www.in.gov/library/finding-aid/L033_Clarke_Grace_Julian_Papers.pdf Grace retained close ties to her father throughout her life. He died in 1899. Grace's mother was the daughter of Joshua Reed Giddings, an abolitionist and a U.S. congressman from Ohio. Grace grew up in Washington, D.C., where her father served as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives until 1871. The family moved to Irvington, a suburban community east of downtown Indianapolis, in 1873. Grace resided in Irvington for the remainder of her life. She attended Mount Zion School and Butler University's preparatory school, which was located in Irvington at that time. Grace continued her education at Butler University, earning an undergraduate degree in 1884 and a master's degree in 1885. Grace was a member of a Unitarian congregation in Indianapolis.James, p. 342. Marriage and family Grace married Charles B. Clarke, an attorney, on September 11, 1887. Clarke, a Democrat, was a former U.S. deputy surveyor in the New Mexico Territory. He served in the Indiana Senate in 1913 and 1915. The couple had no children. Career =Women’s suffrage advocate= Grace was an advocate in the women's suffrage movement, especially women's club activities, and active in several women's organizations in Indiana. She was most involved in founding and leading the Indiana State Federation of Women's Clubs, the Women's Franchise League, and the Legislative Council. In 1892 Clarke formed the Irvington Women's Club, a local literary group, and served as its president. She was the president of the Indianapolis Woman's Club and the Catharine Merrill Club, and also a member of the Society of Indiana Pioneers and the Women's Press Club of Indiana. Clarke was especially active in reviving the suffrage movement in Indiana, especially in gaining support among the state's women's clubs. In 1909 she organized the Seventh District of the Indiana Federation of Women's Clubs, and served as president of the Indiana Federation from 1909 to 1911. She was a director and national press chair of the General Federation of Women's Club from 1912 to 1916. One of her major contributions to the women's movement occurred in 1909, when she helped form a Women's School Commission organization that helped elect the first woman to the Indianapolis school board. Renamed the Woman's School League, Clarke served as its president and continued efforts to achieve suffrage for Indianapolis women. The organization, which had sixty branch and 3,000 members in Indiana, became the Women's Franchise League of Indiana in 1911. It led the suffrage movement within the state. The Indiana group became an affiliate of the National American Woman Suffrage Association.Gugin and St. Clair, p. 63. Clarke served as an officer in the Women's Franchise League and became the first president of the Legislative Council of Indiana, a lobbying organization that she also helped found. Although the Indiana General Assembly defeated women's suffrage legislation in 1915, despite the council's lobbying efforts, it was successful in bringing various groups together to work toward a common goal. On January 20, 1920, Indiana became the twentieth state to ratify the national women's suffrage amendment (the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution). In May 1920, four months after the state legislature ratified the national suffrage amendment, the Women's Franchise League members agreed to dissolve and form the League of Women Voters of Indiana. Clarke continued her involvement with the league, but also began pursuing her interests in the peace movement.Gugin and St. Clair, pp. 63–64. In the aftermath of women gaining the vote, Clarke contributed a column for the Indianapolis Star representing the Democratic perspective and travelled the state speaking about the Democratic party and for its positions and candidates. In her later years Clarke became a peace activist and was interested in international affairs and an ardent Democrat. She was a member of the national committee of the League to Enforce Peace and a member of the American Peace Society. In 1920 Clarke chaired Indiana's committee of Pro-League Independents. She also gave lectures in support of the League of Nations and received criticism for her public support of this unpopular idea. Clarke's civic interests also included service on national and local boards. In 1916 Woodrow Wilson appointed Clarke, a political progressive, as head of the women's division of the Federal Employment Bureau in Indianapolis. In 1931 she was appointed to the Indianapolis City Planning Commission. =Author= In addition to her civic and political interests, Clarke was an author and newspaper journalist. From 1911 to 1929 she contributed a weekly column and a summary of women's club activities and political organizing to the Indianapolis Star, and edited its women's pages for a year. She continued to write for the paper after the passage of the 19th amendment and contributed a political colummn representing the Democratic Party. Clarke also contributed articles to the Indiana Magazine of History. Clarke collected and published a book of her father's speeches, a volume of her own recollections of him, and wrote George W. Julian (1923), a biography of her father that became the first volume in the Indiana Historical Commission's Indiana biography series. Death and legacy Clark died at home in Irvington on June 18, 1938, of pneumonia. Her remains are interred at Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis.

The fundamental opposite is oxidative stress, which can lead to such disease states as coronary heart disease or cancer. Antioxidant compounds reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS), which reduces emitted free-radicals. When ROS function is impaired, there is more susceptibility to atopic disorders or diseases due to impairment of the attack-kill-present-respond behavior of the Th-1 immune response chain. Over-consumption of antioxidants could thus lead to antioxidative stress, where antioxidants might weaken or block the adaptive stress responses and cause dangerous health conditions and cause harm.  Health effects  The concept of antioxidative stress may best be described by excessive or detrimental nutritional consumption of a diet rich in antioxidants, unbalancing the immune systems' pathogenic response processes. Serious health conditions can result if these processes are chronically unbalanced, ranging from acute to chronic. Immunological stress by over-supplementation of antioxidants facilitates adverse health effects specifically including allergies, asthma, and physiological alterations (especially of the skin). Many foods contain antioxidant content, while numerous dietary supplements are exceptionally rich in antioxidants. Products marketed with health benefits routinely tout antioxidant content as a beneficial product aspect without consideration of overall dietary oxidative balances. This is generally due to the biological effects of antioxidants being misunderstood in popular culture, focusing only on their beneficial qualities to reduce ROS to prevent excessive free-radicals which may otherwise lead to well-known disease conditions. = Correlation with medical conditions = Many antioxidative compounds are also antinutrients, such as phenolic compounds, found in plant foods belonging to the families of phenolic acids, flavonoids, isoflavonoids, and tocopherols, among others. Phenolic compounds found in foods generally contribute to their astringency and may also reduce the availability of certain minerals such as zinc. Zinc deficiency is characterized by growth retardation, loss of appetite, and impaired immune function. In more severe cases, zinc deficiency causes hair loss, diarrhea, delayed sexual maturation, impotence, hypogonadism in males, and eye and skin lesions. High-dose supplements of antioxidants may be linked to health risks in some cases, including higher mortality rates. For example, high doses of beta-carotene and vitamin E was found to increase the risk of lung cancer and overall mortality in smokers. High doses of vitamin E may increase risks of prostate cancer and one type of stroke. Antioxidant supplements may also interact with some medicines. = Role of free-radicals = The primary factor in antioxidants causing or promoting the aforementioned health issues, is the attenuation or inactivation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which immune system responders utilize to kill or destroy pathogens, mainly protozoa such as bacteria and fungi. ROS produce free-radicals as a by-product of the oxygen burst used to kill pathogens. Excess free-radicals that are not effectively scavenged and collected result in oxidative stress that can also be harmful. Free-radicals are not the enemy that popular culture has made them out to be, as they aid in proper biochemical signaling that make them necessary in a healthy immune system. Several complex biological free-radical collection systems already exist for the purpose of scavenging, which normally, do not require augmentation by supplementation of antioxidants to function nominally. Disrupting these natural processes by use of antioxidants may have additional undesired results beyond stimulating disease conditions, such as, interference with anti-cancer drugs, so the intensification of the antioxidant protection is not always favorable for the host. = Role in disease = Antioxidants attenuate the Th-1 immune response, responsible for eliminating bacterial and fungal threats, while the Th-2 immune response compensates for a weak Th-1 response by increasing its own responders, which may be not only ineffective, but overall destructive to healthy surrounding tissues, thus harmful. The net result: over-supplementation of antioxidants are a direct, underlying cause of allergenic diseases and skin alterations, spurring signs (objective indications) and symptoms (subjective states) of localized and disseminated medical conditions. Because of the low-level biochemical nature of these immunological systems and their processes, the consequences of antioxidative stress can result in overlying symptoms, leading or contributing to chronic, co-morbid, localized, and/or disseminated disease states, that are clinically challenging to successfully treat. A diet rich in anti-oxidants could allow for skin alterations such as acute acne or chronic non-infectious lesions, especially when the Th-1 immune process is persistently compromised by an overload of dietary antioxidant sources, like daily ingesting of vitamin C supplements, for example. Allergenic reactions by invading atopic pathogens, well beyond the scope of microbiota, can become initial factors triggering chronic atopic disease. When relating to atopic skin conditions caused by chronic antioxidative stress, symptoms similar to Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) may appear, a disease where phagocytes have an impaired ability to destroy pathogens due to a genetic inability to effectively kill pathogens by ROS, versus supplementation induced inability caused by antioxidative stress.  Dietary balance  Nearly all living creatures consume antioxidants in some quantity. Inadequate consumption of dietary antioxidants can be detrimental. For example, a deficiency of vitamin C is a primary cause of scurvy. Vitamin C can be ingested by eating certain fruits. A dietary balance of oxidants and antioxidants are critical in maintaining optimal health. There have been studies on antioxidant capacities of various supplements and compounds. However, there has not been a dietary system devised to quantify what levels of oxidants or antioxidants are \\"healthy\\". Unfortunately, in laboratory testing, there is no single gold standard assay to determine clinically-accepted antioxidant capacity due to numerous available assay methods, though there are several accepted popular assays that can be merged into a final result to produce a representative antioxidative value. Resulting values are subjective because assay methods comprising a final value can vary drastically between individual assay results. Additionally, such a value does not highlight prevalence in types of antioxidants compounds over others (like lycopene versus ascorbic acid), meaning that while a resulting content value between two substances may be similar, though the potential overlying resulting effect can differ, making clinical assessments of resulting symptoms highly unreliable as to the underlying condition. However, a Norwegian scientific study created a table of 3139 products over a period of eight years, with normalized values based on a modified assay, giving a more comprehensive picture when comparing a variety of food antioxidant capacities. While it is not known what constitutes healthy oxidative levels, it is known that regular exercise essentially tightens this balance, by both emitting more ROS, while reducing the capacity of leukocytes for oxidant release. Available antioxidant research has noted the significant challenge in determining what qualifies as oxidative and antioxidative stress, citing a wide range of variables to consider, such as a person's physiology, status, environment, and other factors.  Precipitating nutritional factors  Numerous nutritional substances, compounds, and foods have some degree of antioxidant capacity. High-capacity antioxidants include, but not limited to, vitamins C and E, resveratrol and flavonoids (e.g. wine), Sangre de grado (Croton lechleri) aka Dragons Blood, green and black teas, cloves, cinnamon, most commonly used spices and herbs, mints, several berry and nut species, coffee and chocolates. Normal intake of antioxidants, traditionally considered staples of healthy food, may exert beneficial properties towards some disease states such as neurological disorders, inflammatory conditions, and depression. However, chronic unbalanced ingestion or high quantity supplementation could result in serious ailments due to the suppression of ROS. Allergies, asthma, bacterial and fungal infections of the skin (alterations) are known conditions that stem from antioxidant stress. = Components of antioxidants = There are many types of antioxidant compounds. Examples are, but not limited to, Carotenoids (Beta-carotene, Lycopene), Lutein, Manganese, Magnesium, Selenium, Vitamin A (retinol), Vitamin C (ascorbic acid, ascorbates), and Vitamin E (α‐Tocopherol, tocotrienols), and many more. These compounds can be found as ingredients in various products, or as components of ingredients, or as broader categorical classifications of components. Determining the compound makeup of a product or ingredient allows for general identification of antioxidant compounds, and thus, the potential antioxidant content a product exhibits.  Research  Because overall research and reporting on antioxidative stress is sparse, a fundamental knowledge gap exists in this medically-significant field. Long- term effects of chronic antioxidant stress are not well-researched. Safe levels of antioxidant consumption have yet to be established in human diets. The lack of overall awareness of the subject has invoked comparatively few clinical or field studies, sparse data and statistics, and may suggest a valuable field of nutritional research has been categorically dismissed or overlooked. Assays for oxidative stress and antioxidant reserves are offered by at least one diagnostic company. Diagnosing antioxidative stress is currently extremely rare due to factors such as widespread unfamiliarity, lacking proper understanding in the clinical environment, and trivial modern medical training on the subject. Speculatively, when considering the general abundance of oxidative stress-related conditions (e.g. cancer), a comparable statistical population of antioxidative stress-related conditions (e.g. allergies) is hypothetically viable, based upon available documented research regarding the known resulting pathology of antioxidative stress.

It is a serious pest of cotton crops, the adults and older nymphs feeding on the emerging bolls and the cotton seeds as they mature, transmitting cotton-staining fungi as they do so. Description D. cingulatus, Kaeng Krachan National Park, Thailand Dysdercus cingulatus grows to a length of . It is mainly red but has a white collar and three black spots. It is closely related and very similar to Dysdercus koenigii but D. cingulatus is slightly larger and the femora have varying amounts of black while D. koenigii has completely red femora. Distribution D. cingulatus occurs in Nepal, Sri Lanka, northeastern and southern (Coorg) India, Bangladesh, Thailand, the Philippines, Sumatra, Borneo, Papua New Guinea and northern Australia. Host plants As well as cotton (Gossypium), D. cingulatus feeds on a number of other crop plants including okra (Abelmoschus esculentus), muskmallow (Abelmoschus moschatus), hibiscus, white jute (Corchorus capsularis), citrus and maize (Zea mays). It also attacks trees including silk cotton tree (Bombax ceiba), kapok (Ceiba pentandra), teak (Tectona grandis) and the portia tree (Thespesia populnea). Cotton bugs in Pili, Camarines Sur, Philippines Biology Like other true bugs, Dysdercus cingulatus sucks fluids from its host plants. The only part of the cotton plant affected by this pest is the flower and the seed capsule or boll. As this develops, the insect thrusts its rostrum between the carpels and sucks fluids from the still soft seeds inside. Micro-organisms are admitted in the process and may make the boll contents rot or the lint become discoloured. Meanwhile, the seeds wither, the fibres may fail to expand and the boll may abort. When the seeds of a host plant ripen and it becomes unsuitable, the adult insects migrate to new host plants of the same or different species. While away from their hosts, they feed on nectar and fruit of non-host plants, and can survive for several days without food. They seem fond of citrus fruits, but this may merely be because there are often citrus plantations in close proximity to cotton fields.. Adult females lay several batches, each of sixty to ninety eggs, in chambers they dig in the soil. These hatch after about five days and the nymphs develop through four nymphal stages over a period of thirty to forty or more days before becoming mature.

The purpose was to research methods of improving sustainable fishing and aquaculture of oysters and mussels; however, the bay is home to a major industrial park and port. The project encountered resistance from local politicians and business leaders and was shelved. Location Babitonga Bay is located on the north coast of Santa Catarina and covers a total area of . Its surroundings include the cities of Joinville and São Francisco do Sul. The shores are populated with typical native mangroves, and constitute 75% of the mangroves in the state with an area of about . The bay also has sandy beaches, rocky shores, about 24 islands and tidal flats. The bay is important for its biodiversity and as the most southern of Brazil's remaining mangrove forests. In 2003 the Ministry of the Environment classified it as an area of extreme biological importance. In 2007 the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio) estimated that over 2,000 families of fisherfolk used the natural resources in the proposed reserve area for their livelihood. Aquatic farms cultivated mussels and oysters in the bay, and tourism was expanding. Endangered species such as the Guiana dolphin (Sotalia guianensis), La Plata dolphin (Pontoporia blainvillei) and Atlantic goliath grouper (Epinephelus itajara) depended on the environmental quality of the bay. There were of mangroves in the area, the sole habitat of the over- exploited Uçá (Ucides cordatus) species of mangrove crab. The Bay of Babitonga is also an important harbour and the region holds the state's largest industrial park, which depends on use of the port facilities. The area has been degraded by human occupation over the years. The water has been polluted by human and industrial waste water, siltation due to deforestation, unsustainable fishing and hunting, landfill in the mangroves and other activities. By 2007 the shrimp harvest had dropped drastically from earlier years. Proposal On 18 November 2006 the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) announced that it was studying creation of the Bay of Babitonga Wildlife Reserve, and that public consultations would be held in local communities. The proposed sustainable conservation unit would promote harmonious integration of productive activity in the region with conservation of nature, particularly of land crab, grouper, sea bass, gray dolphin and porpoise. This would be the first wildlife reserve to be created in Brazil. The purpose was to promote research that would benefit fishing and shellfish cultivation in the bay. Activities such as fishing, swimming and sightseeing would be regulated to avoid exceeding the capacity of the environment. The reserve would cover the mangroves and deep water. It would not have direct control over dumping of domestic and industrial sewage, but could help find funding for sewage works. Resistance Seven public consultations were held in communities around the bay in 2006 and 2007, and another was scheduled by ICMBio with IBAMA in São Francisco do Sul on 2 October 2007. After the first public hearing a group of politicians and businesspeople raised the alarm, since the proposal threatened planned projects and privatization of large areas of mangroves. At the 29–30 November 2006 meeting of the National Council of the Environment Sergio Silva of the State of Santa Catarina called for a motion to expand public discussion. Expansion of the port facilities was going through the environmental review process. The consultation process had not been widely publicized in the media. The public meetings were often tense, since many people were against the reserve due to lack of information. The Business Association of Joinville (ACIJ) took a stand against Ibama, saying there was already sufficient protection of the mangroves and surrounding forests, and treatment of effluents was sufficient. A delegation led by Governor Luiz Henrique da Silveira met with president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (Lula) in Brasilia. Lula told the Minister of the Environment Marina Silva to cancel the plan. An injunction was filed in court by trade and industry NGOs to prevent any further action. As of 2016 Chico Mendes Institute had still not created any wildlife reserves.

Characteristics  This dessert offers a way of consuming fruits which are not ripening satisfactorily on the tree: their flesh becoming grainy, they have to be picked when they are barely ripe, in order to allow the starch to turn into sugar.  History  This dessert with old connotations, somewhat out of fashion has undergone considerable evolution. In the early 19th century, a recipe already existed, known as \\"housewife pear compote\\". The pears were cooked in a pan with red wine, sugar, a piece of cinnamon and cloves. Once they were cooked, the pears developed wrinkles, thus the name \\"bonne femme\\" (\\"old wife\\"). But the cooking did not always result in the desired red color. So a little cochineal was added and it was preserved with a tin spoon inside the jar> this is explained by Gaston Bachelard, in his book Rational materialism: \\"Tin has the property on enhancing the red color of vegetable matter; this fact is known by cooks, who never fail to put a tin spoon in pear compote, in order to give it a good red color\\".  Varieties  The varieties most used during the 19th century were the Messire-Jean pears and the Bon-Chretien pears, white and red. These days, pears used are Passe- Crassane and Conference.  Ingredients  To prepare the pears with red wine, a fruity wine (in this case, Beaujolais) should be used. The other ingredients are: sugar or honey, cloves, peppercorn, a piece of cinnamon stick, a small vanilla pod and some orange zest. It is also possible to add ginger and green cardamom, and to maintain the red color with a little raspberry or blackcurrant liquor.  Preparation  Poaching is done in syrup full of wine, with the spices and zests. The mixture is brought to the boil; the pears need to stay slightly firm. They are then drained, thus allowing the wine to be reduced by letting it boil and become a thicker sauce. The dessert is served cold or lukewarm.

S. service for a three years, term. Twelve companies were recruited but one was transferred to the 105th Infantry. It was next ordered to Fortress Monroe, where it embarked on what proved to be an expedition to Port Royal. Here the fleet arrived Nov 7, and captured Forts Walker and Beauregard. Beaufort was next occupied and the regiment remained in this vicinity for several months, the men suffering very much from sickness. The 100th, participated in the operations against Charleston in June 1862, and lost very heavily in the engagement of June 16, near Secessionville. Returning to Hilton Head and Beaufort in July, it was ordered to Virginia, later being sent to Fredericksburg and attached to the 9th Corps of the Army of Virginia. After various marches during the month of August, the regiment met the enemy on the Bull Run battlefield, where it saw hard service. After engaging all day and losing heavily, a final charge was ordered, from which only 198 out of 450 returned unhurt. It was active at Chantilly and South Mountain, but was held in reserve at Antietam, owing to its crippled condition. It was engaged at Fredericksburg and after the battle performed important duty in covering the withdrawal of the troops, being selected as \\"The most reliable skirmish regiment in the brigade.\\" In March 1863, it was transferred to the Department of the Ohio and sent to Lexington, Ky., from which place it was ordered in June to the support of Gen. Grant at Vicksburg. It participated in the fighting at Jackson, Miss., after the fall of Vicksburg, and lost many men from sickness as well as from the enemy's fire. On its return north it was ordered to East Tennessee though many of the men were not fit for active service.

In 1670 Proprietor Lord Anthony Ashley Cooper and famed philosopher John Locke combined to realize the first revised colonial constitution accepted by the body Proprietorship. The importance to legal history of this first constitution is that it actually banned legal practice as a profession and sought to simplify legal dictates so that under educated nobles could run the colony effectively. The 1670 constitution banned legal commentary and established eight administrative courts whose aristocratic members composed part of a Grand Council that would prepare legislation produced in the colony's parliament. The journal of the Grand Council would, due to that body's power, become the first legislative record of the Carolina colony but also contains judicial rulings and executive actions undertaken due to the Council's fiat. Chief Justice Nicholas Trott compiled the first comprehensive record of parliamentary statutes in 1712 which covered all the preceding years from 1682, with the majority being English common law statutes that could still apply in a vastly different environment. The collection of South Carolina colonial and state laws released by Judge John Grimke in 1790 includes the record from before Trott's time in office up until the formation of the United States.  Record of Law between Independence and the American Civil War  The next compendium of South Carolina law would be gathered and edited by legal reformer Dr. Thomas Cooper. Cooper acted under a resolution passed by the General Assembly in December 1834 to \\"compile under his direction the statute law of the state, now of force\\". Cooper commented of his task, > I am required to compile an edition of the Statute Law of South-Carolina: Is > it to be an imperfect and mutilated edition of our public Law, or one that > will answer the description of the 'Statutes at Large'? I have preferred the > latter: because, it is better to insert somewhat too much than somewhat too > little: because, the reasons for a present law, are often derived from, and > the law itself elucidated by, the imperfections it is meant to supersede -. Cooper died before the fifth volume went to the publisher leading to the appointment of Dr. David James Mccord by Governor Patrick Noble to finish the project. The tenth and final volume, an index, was published in 1841. Legislative year books published by the General Assembly would continue to proliferate, covering the time period from Mccord's work through the American Civil War. Volumes in the format seen of The Statutes at Large would have to wait until after the massive upheaval of the 1860s, to be added for the collective educational benefit of South Carolina's legal community.

In 2017, he was selected (along with three other artists) to represent Nigeria at the Venice Biennale, the first time Nigeria would be represented in the event. Education and work influence Ehikhamenor was born in Udomi-Uwessan, Edo State, Nigeria. He was educated in Nigeria and in the United States. He returned from the United States in 2008 to work in Lagos. His work is strongly influenced by work done by villagers especially his grandmother who was a cloth weaver. His uncle was also a photographer, his maternal grandfather a blacksmith, and his mother, a local artist. He is also inspired by wall paintings and installation arts, mostly in community shrines.\\"Musing with Victor Ehikhamenor\\" Nigerianstalk/Kola Tubosun. June 2013.\\"The ‘Natural’ Artist: Amatoritsero Ede in conversation with Victor Ehikhamenor\\" MTLS. September 2014.\\"Victor Ehikhamenor: Shaped by memory and tribal tradition\\" Financial Times. March 27, 2015 This has been an enduring feature of his work, which is abstract, symbolic and politically motivated; and influenced by the duality of African traditional religion and the interception of Western beliefs, memories and nostalgia. Ehikhamenor's art and photographs have been used for editorials as well as cover art on books by authors such as Chimamanda Adichie, Helon Habila and Chika Unigwe. They have also been illustrated on fabric and exhibited at international fashion parades.  Art and writing career  Ehikhamenor has held numerous solo art exhibitions across the world. In 2016, he was one of 11 Nigerian artists invited to join twenty-three Indonesian artists in the grand exhibition at the Biennale. At the Jogja National Museum, he showed an installation titled \\"The Wealth of Nations.\\" He has also published numerous fiction and critical essays with academic journals, mainstream magazines and newspapers from around the world including The New York Times, CNN Online, Washington Post, Farafina, AGNI Magazine and Wasafiri. His short story, \\"The Supreme Command\\", won the Association of Commonwealth Broadcasters Award in 2003. His debut poetry collection, Sordid Rituals, was published in 2002. His second book, Excuse Me! (2012), a satirical creative non-fiction view of life as an African both at home and abroad, is a recommended text in two Nigerian universities.  Comments on Damien Hirst piece  On May 8, 2017, while participating in the Venice Biennale, Ehikhamenor first called attention to what he describes as Damien Hirst cultural appropriation of Nigerian Yoruba art. The exhibition of the British artist, called “Treasures From the Wreck of the Unbelievable”, featured a variety of sculptures meant to be viewed as debris rescued from a shipwreck. But one of the displayed artefacts was a copy of \\"Ori Olokun\\", a famous Ife bronze art from the 14th century now described as \\"Golden heads\\". Of the appropriation, Ehikhamenor had posted on Instagram \\"For the thousands of viewers seeing this for the first time, they won’t think Ife, they won’t think Nigeria. Their young ones will grow up to know this work as Damien Hirst’s. As time passes it will pass for a Damien Hirst regardless of his small print caption. The narrative will shift and the young Ife or Nigerian contemporary artist will someday be told by a long nose critic “Your work reminds me of Damien Hirst’s Golden Head”. We need more biographers for our forgotten.\\" His words brought the issue to the forefront on local and international media.  Angels and Muse  In February 2018, Ehikhamenor opened Angels and Muse, described as \\"a multi-modal co-working space in Lagos draped with wall murals, stained glasses, and beautiful lighting, making for a stunning visual and immersive experience.\\" The space, also used for artist residencies, is located in the Ikoyi area of Lagos state and contains a ‘multidisciplinary room,’ used for \\"workshop, training, book reading, experimental or conceptual art exhibitions, among other usages.\\" The project was featured on the 10th episode of the Netflix 'Amazing Interiors' series in July 2018.  Recent News  Ehikhamenor was one of the first artists invited to Art Dubai in March 2018. In July 2018, he was also one of the Nigerian artists selected to meet and exhibit work for visiting French President Emmanuel Macron. The exhibition, organised by ART X Lagos took place at the Afrika Shrine, the nightclub of Femi Kuti.

Although the town was renamed Bonaparte in 1841, the Meek family had a central role in its development through the turn of the 20th-century. with The present building is a three-story, gable roofed, rectangular structure that was built on a raised basement of ashlar limestone blocks. It was constructed in 1878 by William's son Robert, who had succeeded his father in running the family businesses. He was assisted by his brothers Isaiah and Joseph. It replaced the original 1844 mill, which had been destroyed in a fire. While built on the same site, it is unknown if any part of the present structure was a part of the original mill. Two other structures belonging to the Meek's family are located nearby: a woolen mill (1853), and a saw mill (1860). The mill was operated by Grant C. Scott and Stephen Blackburn by 1900, and Daniel Cresap was the last miller who operated the mill when a flood destroyed the dam in 1905. The building was left vacant for 21 years until a feed store was housed here from 1928 to 1963. The Farmers Cooperative Association occupied the building until 1977. It was then converted into a restaurant. The building was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Six years later it was included as a contributing property in the Bonaparte Historic Riverfront District.

Rotvælsk was used by a social group known as Natmændsfolk who did simple craftsmanship, demeaning and unclean work or panhandled to survive.

Resnick (December 13, 1914 - October 29, 1986) was an American architect, a disciple of Frank Lloyd Wright, and one of the founders and chief architects of what has now become known as the Usonia Historic District. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places in Pleasantville, New York, Resnick designed twelve of the forty-three homes there. A structural engineer, as well as an architect, Resnick and his colleague, David Henken were in charge of constructing the Wright designed roads and the water system for the whole project, submitting plans to Wright for his approval. Career as architect Calabi-Picker House Resnick graduated from Brooklyn Technical High School. Later he went on to study architecture at New York University and engineering at City University of New York. Resnick taught architecture and engineering at the New York Institute of Technology from 1965-1985 while running his own firm. In 2015 Architectural Digest cited one of Resnick’s houses as \\"a spectacular example of period design.\\" A collection of over 100 Aaron Resnick designs, 1947-1986, are housed in the Avery Drawings & Archives collection of Columbia University along with designs of Frank Lloyd Wright, Ulrich Franzen, Paul Schweikher and David Henken. Among other notable Usonian homes designed by Resnick is the Calabi-Picker House (1956) in Dutchess County, New York. In 1983 Resnick designed an addition to the house to serve as a work studio for the composer, Tobias Picker. Picker's mother, the artist, Henriette Simon Picker, (1917-2016) later used it as her art studio working there until her death in 2016 at the age of 99. In recognition of Resnick's contributions to the architectural development of the Usonian home the Westchester Hudson Valley Chapter of the American Institute of Architects grants a yearly scholarship to a promising young architectural student in his name. =Style= Commenting on his Usonia work to The New York Times in 1981, Resnick recalled: I think there was a great surge of idealism after the war, which gave us a freedom to do what we wanted to do. We were united on several concepts: we wanted natural or organic houses, we wanted a sense of community spirit and we needed homes that could be built inexpensively. And, of course, we were all admirers of architect Frank Lloyd Wright. Of course, in those days architects weren't talking about passive or active solar. But, esthetically, we were concentrating on opening up the house to the south, to greet the sunshine. Additionally, many of Resnick's Usonian homes used circles and curves far more than the typical architecture of the time. Family In 1949, Aaron Resnick and his wife, Mildred became the first family to move to Usonia into a house Resnick designed. The house exhibits the quintessential Usonian vocabulary: open workspace, clerestory windows, natural brick, and red concrete floors. Death Aaron Resnick died of a heart attack, October 29, 1986 at the age of 72.

He has directed music videos, commercials and documentary series for television, most recently Uffe’s Alternative. (2 episodes, DR 2015). He was educated at the National Film School of Denmark, graduating in 2005. His film Ballroom Dancer (2011), won several awards from around the world. The film is a documentary portrait of a retired ballroom dancer, who attempts to return to the world elite; a quest with a high personal cost. The documentaries Bonke chooses to work on usually have a dramatic character. The person portrayed really develops and has a mission to accomplish. This gives Bonke the opportunity to work with a variety of dramatic and visual tricks, perhaps more typical from feature film. We see examples of this in First Love (2007), ' and Ejersbo. In the TV documentary Uffe's Alternative, he follows politician Uffe Elbæk with his camera in the hectic period from the formation of the party The Alternative in November 2013, through to the June 2015 general election. The film joins the documentary style of the observing camera, or direct cinema, often used in political documentaries. Examples of note include US D.A. Penne Baker’s The War Room (1993) about Bill Clinton's presidential campaign in 1992, and Christoffer Guldbrandsen's Fogh behind the facade (2003) on Danish prime minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen's negotiations around the enlargement of the EU in 2002. A recurring theme in Bonke’s films, regardless of form, is the fascination with someone who is truly passionate about an idea. His films are very personal portraits, and he always puts the human aspect at the apex.

While serving part-time in the General Assembly as discussed below, Bemiss was vice-president of FitzGerald and Company (a family business), but ultimately resigned that legislative position because of his responsibilities as the president of Virginia Skyline Co. (another family business, that operated concessions along Skyline Drive through Shenandoah National Park and the Blue Ridge Mountains in Virginia). Bemiss also served on the Board of Directors of State Planters Bank (and its successors United Virginia Bank and Crestar Bank) from 1963 until 1992, and on the James River Paper Company board from 1972 until 1995.

He was skeptical of its attempts to close schools which complied with desegregation orders, which the General Assembly later adopted as part of the Stanley Plan. After both the Virginia Supreme Court and a three judge federal panel on January 19, 1959 (Robert E. Lee's birthday, a state holiday in Virginia) found the Stanley Plan unconstitutional, Bemiss served on the Perrow Commission. After his resignation to serve in the state Senate, Richmond's seven-member delegation changed with T. Coleman Andrews Jr. and David E.

Willey represented Richmond City in District 33, which became District 30 in the session that convened in January 1966. He was replaced by fellow Democrat J. Sargeant Reynolds.

Following law school, Boutros clerked for the Honorable Eugene E. Siler Jr. of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. After graduating, he worked as a defense attorney in the Washington, D.C. office of an international law firm. He helped launch and run the firm's Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) group. U.S. Department of Justice In 2007, Boutros was hired by U.S. Attorney, Patrick Fitzgerald, to work as an Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois. He relocated to Chicago for the job and started work on January 7, 2008. He was a key member of the Financial Crimes and Special Prosecutions unit at the office. Over the course of his nearly 8-year career, Boutros prosecuted notable cases involving white collar crimes, fraud, laundering, drug trafficking, cybercrime, and more. Some of his most notable work involved the prosecution of individuals involved in the Silk Road online \\"black market.\\" He assisted in the prosecution of the founder of the Silk Road, Ross Ulbricht, who received a life sentence after conviction. He also led the prosecution and conviction of the individual referred to as the Silk Road's \\"most prolific online drug dealer,\\" Cornelis Jan \\"SuperTrips\\" Slomp. Boutros' prosecution led to a ten-year prison sentence for Slomp in May 2015. Boutros was also the prosecutor for what was known as \\"largest food fraud in U.S. history\\" (or \\"Honeygate\\"). The first phase of the law enforcement operation involved individuals and companies that had been involved in the illegal importation of cheap and occasionally contaminated honey from China. The food fraud and criminal antidumping duty case led to $80 million in losses. The second phase of the operation focused on individuals and companies who were illegally buying and shipping the illegally imported Chinese honey. The fraud in the second phase of the operation amounted to $180 million in losses. The total amount of fraud involved in the so-called \\"Project Honeygate\\" was worth $260 million. One of Boutros' other significant prosecutions was among his first cases and involved healthcare prosecution. Boutros charged Peter G. Rogan, who owned the Edgewater Medical Center in Chicago and owed $188 million in civil judgments largely for Medicare fraud, with perjury and obstruction of justice in 2008. Rogan evaded capture in Canada for seven years. In Boutros' last act as a federal prosecutor in 2015, he represented the government in the case against Rogan. Rogan was sentenced to 21 months in prison. Private practice and teaching In October 2015, Boutros was hired by Chicago-based law firm, Seyfarth Shaw, to be National Co- Chair of its White Collar, Internal Investigations and False Claims practice, thereby ending his nearly 8-year career with the U.S. Attorney's Office in Chicago.

Stolpe was born in Hämeenlinna and completed his gymnasium in Kotka. He studied Master of Arts in University of Helsinki. After his graduation, he worked the following fourteen years in managerial positions for metal processor Oy Vuoksenniska Ab first as ore mine director and later in the head office. During 1968–1976 Stolpe worked as manager in Kymin Oy engineering industry division. Stolpe became division manager in Wärtsilä in 1976 and in 1978 he became the company director of operations. During period of dual leadership in 1978–1987 he managed Wärtsilä together with Tankmar Horn, after which he became managing director. Stolpe left his position in 1989 – in the same year when the company subsidiary Wärtsilä Marine fell in bankruptcy.  Early years and studies  Stolpe was born in Hämeenlinna, where his father Nils Stolpe served as military officer. He moved many times during his childhood, but the most part of it he spent in Mustila, Elimäki. Stople was interested in nature, literature and history. Stolpe graduated from Kotka Swedish Coeducational School in 1945. He continued his studies in University of Helsinki, where he took actively part in student activities. In 1948 he was elected the secretary of the Swedish-speaking coalition of nations. Stolpe was selected board chairman of the Helsinki University Student Union in 1953; he was the first Swedish-speaking Finn in the position after a period of over 40 years. Stolpe graduated as Master of Arts in 1954.  Vuoksenniska  After completing his studies, Stolpe started as geologist in Oy Vuoksenniska Ab and for the following five years he surveyed ore deposits in Nyhamn, Åland and Jussarö, Ekenäs. The examinations led to foundation of an ore mine in Jussarö; Stolpe was appointed the local director in 1959. The initial target for annual production was 300,000 tonnes of iron ore; however, the downward price trend of steel combined with introduction of large intercontinental bulk carriers led to decline of producer prices and eventually running down the mine. Stolpe got a new position as administrative department manager in Vuoksenniska headquarter in Helsinki in 1966. He left the company after fourteen years of service in 1968.  Högfors works  In 1968 Stolpe became manager of Kymin Oy Högfors works, and in 1970 he became manager of the company engineering industry division. The Högfors works' main products were enamelled bathtubs, but the portfolio moved gradually make-to-print products delivered to vehicle industry. The bathtub production collapsed during the oil crisis of the 1970s when the government prohibited them from new state funded rental houses, in order to save energy. Subsequently, the Högfors works fell into trouble.  Wärtsilä  Tankmar Horn, the manager of multi industrial company Oy Wärtsilä Ab, restructured the company by dividing it to six different divisions by industry. In 1976 Stolpe was appointed manager of Industrial Division I. In 1978 Stolpe followed Horn as operating manager; Horn himself focused on public relations. During Stolpe's leadership the head office was moved from Sörnäinen to Siltasaari in Helsinki. The company reached to international market; Wärtsilä took over diesel engine production of Swedish NOHAB in 1978 and was enlisted into Stockholm stock exchange in 1983. One year later Wärtsilä was enlisted into London stock exchange, as the first Finnish company. In 1987, following retirement of Tankmar Horn, Stolpe became the company main director. In the beginning of the same year Wärtsilä and Valmet shipyards were put under one organisation, Wärtsilä Marine. As a part of arrangement of the ownership, Wärtsilä paper machine production was transferred to Valmet. Since the beginning Wärtsilä Marine created massive losses and Stolpe left his position as Wärtsilä Marine chairman in autumn 1989 just some months before it fell in a scandalous bankruptcy in the following October. He left also his position as the parent company manager.  Political career  Stolpe was member of SFP. During 1963–1965 he was member of Ekenäs town board. He was member of town council in 1965.

Biography Forstner was the only son of Franz Forstner, a carpenter, and his wife Anna. He completed his primary education in Leonfelden, before completing his education in Linz. Through his uncle Anton Forstner he was able to be released from an apprenticeship in glass painting and mosaic installation in Innsbruck and instead studied at the University of Applied Arts in Vienna. There, he studied under Karl Karger and Koloman Moser. Moser would go on to mentor Forstner. After the end of his studies in Vienna, Forstner would go on to study at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich, under Ludwig von Herterich. Mosaic at the Grand Hotel Wiesler, in Graz Although his studies in Munich ran from 1902 to 1903, Forstner had begun to work as an artist, painter and illustrator from 1901. In 1906 he founded the \\"Wiener Mosaikwerkstätte\\", and two years later he was given a trade licence to produce glass mosaics. He presented work at the 1908 Wiener Kunstschau, organised by Gustav Klimt and Josef Hoffman. He also presented work at the Spring showings of the Hagenbund, a Viennese art collective. Originally Forstner's mosaics were in the traditional Venetian or Florentine technique and style, he became famous for his mixed media and tile mosaics, for example the Klimt frieze in the Palais Stoclet. As well as his own designs, Forstner collaborated with many important artists of the time, for example Klimt, Otto Wagner, Otto Schönthal and Emil Hoppe. Between 1908 and the outbreak of the First World War he produced his most successful work, and expanded his workshop. In 1911, he married his wife, Stephanie (née Stöger), and together they had two children, Georg (born 1912) and Karl (born 1913). Mosaic at the Dianabad (bathhouse), in Leopoldstadt In 1912 he became a member of the Bund Österreichischer Künstler, and with the architect Cesar Poppovits and the painter Alfred Basel, he founded the Wiener Friedhofskunst. That year, the success and popularity of his work enabled him to build his own glass kiln. In 1913 he became an associate member of the Society of Austrian Architects. During the First World War, he was a Collection Officer in Albania and Macedonia. After the war, he moved to Stockerau, the home town of his wife. There he established two new premises but was forced to sell both. Due to the poor economic conditions in Austria after the First World War, Forstner worked more as an all-round artist rather than focusing solely on mosaics. He worked on several War Memorials, as an architect and landscape designer and, from 1929 to 1936 as the art master at Hollabrunn Gymnasium. A road in Hollabrunn is named for him.

He was a prolific book illustrator and designer of book covers, posters and prints. Biography Mozley was born in Darnall, Sheffield, and, while still a schoolboy, attended the Sheffield School of Art. An exhibition of his artworks were held at the Hibbert Brothers Gallery in the city in 1933. After spending 1933 teaching in Sheffield, Mozley won a scholarship to the Royal College of Art, RCA, in 1934. When he left the RCA in 1937, Mozley taught life drawing, anatomy and lithography at the Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts. He also quickly established himself as a freelance artist. Invasion Preparations in an English Village (Art.IWM ART 15546) At the start of the Second World War, Mozley joined the British Army and worked for military intelligence and on camouflage designs. In 1940, Mozley submitted a number of works to the War Artists' Advisory Committee. The Committee purchased one of these pieces, A Kentish Lane, 1940 and also issued Mozley with a wartime sketching permit which allowed him to paint outdoors, mainly in London and Plymouth, during the conflict. WAAC purchased at least one further work from Mozley in June 1944. Mozley was in the Royal Engineers, and retired with the rank of Acting Lieutenant-Colonel. After the War, Mozley established himself as a prolific commercial artist working in different techniques. He designed film posters for Alexander Korda, theatre posters for the Lyric Theatre in Hammersmith and worked on mural designs for the Festival of Britain. As well as designing hundreds of book covers, Mozley created book illustrations for the Limited Editions Club of New York, the publishers Chatto and Windus and for the Folio Society. Interior decoration, drawings for television commercials and press adverts for British European Airways were also undertaken. Mozley designed posters for the London Underground, Shell and for Lyons tea-rooms. In 1979, a retrospective of Mozley's work was held at the King Street Gallery in London and his drawings of Venice were exhibited at Somerset House in support of the Venice in Peril Fund. Family life While he was at the Royal College of Art, Mozley met Eileen Kohn, who was also an artist, and they married in 1938. Her sister Joan would later marry one of Mozley's contemporaries, Edwin La Dell. Mozley had two sons and three daughters. Mozley died of heart failure in 1991, surviving his wife by two years. From 1971 until his death, Mozley lived in Kew, in a house which he had bought from another artist, John Plant. A retrospective exhibition of Mozley's lithographic work was held at the Barbican Centre library in 2002. The same year, Grey College in Durham also hosted an overview of his career. Three years later, the Barbican Centre held an exhibition of his artworks.

The fountain is made out of granite, and is a diameter octagon with red granite columns, in the Gothic style, and is situated near to the Hackney gate of the park. The opening of the fountain in 1862 was attended by 10,000 spectators. The year after the fountain was installed, The Illustrated London News called Victoria Park the best people's park in London, due to its facilities such as the fountain. In his Dictionary of London, Charles Dickens, Jr. described the fountain as \\"beautiful\\". In 1975, the fountain was given Grade II* listed status by Historic England. In 2011, the fountain was refurbished as part of a major restoration of Victoria Park. The fountain is no longer in public use; instead, it is protected by a metal fence around it.

Her mother wrote her version of their story in her 1987 biography Not Without My Daughter, which was adapted into a 1991 feature film of the same name in which Mahtob was portrayed by Sheila Rosenthal and her parents were portrayed by Sally Field and Alfred Molina. Biography Mahtob was born to parents Betty and Sayyed Bozorg \\"Moody\\" Mahmoody in Houston, Texas on September 4, 1979. Her first name means \\"Moonlight\\" in Persian. It was her father who named her that after he was inspired by a full moon. Mahtob has two half-brothers through Betty's first marriage, Joe and John, who are thirteen and nine years older than her respectively. Mahtob and her parents lived in Texas before moving to Michigan. She grew up in Alpena, Michigan. On August 4, 1984, Mahtob and her parents arrived in Tehran to meet with Moody's relatives. Their stay was originally meant to have lasted only two weeks, but Mahtob and Betty were held captive by Moody for eighteen months. According to Mahtob, Betty suspected that Moody would keep them in Iran when he suggested that they visit, but she was afraid that if she said no, he would kidnap their daughter. Mahtob stated in an interview with NPR: Since Moody was an Iranian citizen by birth, he legally had complete custody of Mahtob. Betty was worried that Mahtob would learn anti-American sentiment at school. Mahtob also alleged that her father would physically beat her and her mother. After eighteen months, Mahtob and her mother managed to escape from Iran by crossing the mountains of Turkey. They successfully made it back to the United States and Mahtob never saw her father again. Six years after Moody's death in 2009, Mahtob has confirmed that she has forgiven her father for his actions. When Mahtob was 13, she was diagnosed with lupus. She managed to survive the disease because of experimental treatment. She resides in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Mahtob is a devout member of the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod. In 2015, Mahtob's memoir My Name is Mahtob was published. Though it depicts Mahtob's version of her family's story, My Name is Mahtob has been considered a sequel to her mother's book, Not Without My Daughter.

Gameplay 8-Bit Armies is a real time strategy game designed to mirror the look and gameplay of classic RTS games. It features a singleplayer campaign and a multiplayer mode in which players battle each other or the AI in the cooperative game mode. The game takes a very simplistic approach in its gameplay and graphical elements. The graphic features a blocky 8-bit retro-art voxel style with partially destructible terrain. Gameplay is very similar to the classic Command & Conquer franchise, many of the original developers of which work for Petroglyph Games. The player starts with a headquarter building which they use to expand their base so they can build various military units to fight their opponents. Resources are gathered via oil trucks and refineries. Units and buildings are built via a clickable menu on the right side of the screen. The game is situated in a contemporary scenario featuring generic tank, artillery or rocket units. At the release of the game, only one faction was playable, but Petroglyph Games announced that they planned to release more factions later on. On August 28, 2016 Petroglyph Games released 2 free DLCs for the game: one for the 2nd faction called 'Guardian' and one for a new campaign which includes the new faction. In the same month Petroglyph Games also released a spin-off to the original games, called 8-Bit Hordes. It uses the same engine as 8-Bit Armies but features a fantasy-themed scenario. A second spin-off, called 8-Bit Invaders was also released and featured a science- fiction-themed scenario with a high-tech human and an alien faction. The game also features cross game multiplayer battles, allowing players to play against each other with all factions from all three games. Release and reception 8-Bit Armies was released digitally on April 22, 2016 on Steam as well as GOG.com. The reception of the game was mixed to positive. Reviewers acknowledged the game as a homage to the classic Command & Conquer franchise, with a similar simplistic gameplay approach and a classic retro graphic style. The classic RTS gameplay has been praised as the core strength of the game. Some reviews criticised the lack of variety: only one faction is playable, the campaign features no distinctive story line and the gameplay may feel repetitive. The soundtrack, which has been composed by former Command & Conquer composer Frank Klepacki, has been noted positively. As conclusion, reviews described the game as a nostalgic flashback which falls short in variety and long-time motivation.

PLOT When meek widower Thomas F. Sherridan, a construction engineer and owner of the Continental Construction Co., receives a telegram from his eldest son Ken informing him of his impending visit home, he promptly organizes a family reunion. Tom's sister Addie, who raised his three children and still manages his household, prepares a special dinner to celebrate Ken's homecoming. Ken, an architect \\"with new ideas\\" shows up with a mustache and a new girl friend, department store heiress Beatrice Manning, and announces that he has quit his job. When younger brother Larry and his sister Carroll arrive, the three siblings make plans to dine out, thoughtlessly leaving Tom and Aunt Addie behind. Once alone, Tom reveals to Addie that he is nearly bankrupt, in part because his extravagant offspring have always charged their various purchases to his account. Addie disapproves of this practice and also of Carroll's boyfriend, Jim Martin, who has been separated from his wife since she became an invalid after being seriously injured in a car accident while out with another man. Shortly after his arrival home, Ken, while dining with Beatrice and her father, sees Carroll and Jim together, and later, he tells Carroll that Jim isn't good enough for her. Meanwhile, Tom insists on keeping his financial woes a secret from his family, and he is harassed by sleazy businessman Lester Walsh, holder of the $20,000 mortgage on Tom's house. Walsh attempts to bribe Tom into approving the use of an inexpensive and inferior cement for the construction of a hospital in which Walsh has an interest. Addie finally tells Ken, Larry and Carroll how dire their father's financial situation is, and realizing the error of their ways, they all resolve to help. Carroll offers to wed Jim in exchange for $20,000, but he refuses, saying that such an arrangement would spoil their relationship. Addie, who has been courted for several years by Sam Townsend, offers him her hand, and he gladly accepts. The Reverend Huxley, an old friend of Addie's, decides to adopt one of Ken's avant-garde designs, previously rejected by the Manning Department Store, for his new tabernacle, a project on which Tom, Ken and Sam are to be partners. The only dark cloud on the horizon is a series of armed robberies in the locale, which Addie fears may have been committed by Larry, who once bragged about owning a gun; however, it is soon discovered that Larry has sold his gun and car and is working as a soda jerk in order to help his father. The balance of the Sherridans' mortgage is mysteriously paid off, and Carroll soon realizes that the anonymous benefactor is none other than Jim, whose wife has recently died. A grateful Ken invites Jim to a celebration at the Sherridan home as he eagerly begins the design of the future house for the newly united family.Pitts p.108 Cast * Maude Eburne as Aunt Addie * Donald Meek as Thomas Sherridan * Irene Ware as Carroll Sherridan * William Bakewell as Ken Sherridan * Polly Ann Young as Eleanor * Lona Andre as Beatrice Manning * Frank Coghlan Jr. as Larry Sherridan * Malcolm McGregor as Jim Martin * Edwin Maxwell as Lester Walsh * Robert McKenzie as Sam Townsend * Fred Sumner as Mr. Manning * Richard Carlyle as Rev.

The strategy involves automating processes, data visibility, compliance on legislation and solving business problems related to staffing. It is used by call centers to improve workforce management and agent performance. Description Workforce optimization uses all aspects of the complete workforce management life-cycle and provides key insights into how its workforce is performing, with a focus on customer experience. Workforce optimization includes automating entire processes, making key data more visible to support better decision-making, ensuring compliance on relevant legislation and solving business problems related to staff. It is used by contact centers to make convenient communication with customers, such as text messaging support. The strategy ties together the human resources, operations and IT departments of a business. Workforce optimization manages the performance of staff to understand the impact on both operational efficiency and the customer experience. Companies use VoC insights to improve customer experience, which increases the effectiveness of its agents and builds customer loyalty. Development DMG Consulting's 2014 \\"Contact Center Workforce Optimization Market Share Report\\" documented an increase in workforce optimization revenue over the 2013 fiscal year. It noted an increase in investments to improve core solutions as well as improvements in back-office and branch workforce optimization solutions. In 2015, DMG Consulting found a resurgence in workforce management due to innovation in usability and functionality through speech and text analytics, desktop analytics and customer journey analytics applications. It also considered a shift in the workforce optimization market to emphasize enterprise analytics that personalize customer interaction. To make strategic decisions in the modern and complex business landscape, organizations are also using Big Data and Analytics for workforce planning. In fact, 80 percent of executives say their big data investments have been successful, and almost half say their organizations can measure the benefits from their projects. What’s more, according to Harvard Business Review, organizations that excel in data-driven decision-making are more productive and more profitable than their competitors on average.

Biography  Coat of arms of the Tenaille de Vaulabelle family: Of \\"Gules with golden pal, accosted with two fleurs-de-lis of the same and loaded with an azure bayonet\\" After he spent his youth in Bourgogne, Éléonore de Vaulabelle moved to Paris at the end of the Bourbon restauration. There he authored articles in several satirical newspapers as well as a daily pamphlet for Le Figaro, where he met Alphonse Karr and George Sand. He wrote two novels under the pseudonym Ernest Desprez and a fictionalized autobiography: Un enfant. In Les Femmes vengées, he developed a theory inspired from Molière: \\"Women are what we make of them\\". Vaulabelle adds, \\"If women lie it is because we teach them to lie\\". But he devoted most of his work to theatre under the pseudonym Jules Cordier, most of the time in collaboration with Clairville. Only the collection of short stories Les Jours heureux appeared under his real name. If he privately adhered to Republican ideas - probably under the influence of his older brother, Achille Tenaille de Vaulabelle, author of Histoire des deux Restaurations and Minister of Education under general Louis-Eugène Cavaignac's presidency in 1848 – in theatre, he expressed his opposition to the regime according to the forms of the time Philibert Audebrand, Petits mémoires d'une stalle d'orchestre, (p. 167-179).

Their writing often addresses questions related to the meaning of life, the nature of being (ontology), theories of knowledge and knowing (epistemology), principles of beauty (aesthetics), first principles of things (metaphysics) or the existence of God. Some may make broad philosophical inquires and engage with diverse philosophical topics throughout their poetry, while others may concentrate within one branch of philosophical poetry. For example, Dante is considered by some to be both a philosophical poet, in a general sense, as well as a metaphysical poet. Although a group discussion may provide fruitful conditions for some to explore philosophical themes, poetry may be seen an alternative entry into philosophical thinking. Children and young writers may find it easier to begin writing philosophical poetry if they start by using poetic styles other than rhyme, such as repetitive form, since rhyme can be distracting and may interfere with the free flow of their philosophical thoughts. Most, but not all, philosophical poets do eventually develop one preferred form of philosophical verse when it comes to the style of their writing. For example, Rumi and Hafiz often utilize the single verse form, while Dickinson usually adheres to the quatrain form. Philosophical poets hail from both the Eastern and Western traditions.

It was made with a single sheet of three-ply lightweight waterproof plywood. It was marketed throughout the United States and Canada. Peak production of the canoe occurred during the 1920s. The length was extended in 1930 and by 1934 it was no longer made.  Background  Henry L. Haskell was a businessman and inventor. He invented a waterproof glue that was used in the construction of a plywood referred to as haskelite. One of his products he manufactured with the plywood was military airplane body parts.Motor Boat 1920, p. 38.

He made a canoe from the plywood he manufactured with the glue. The canoe was made with a single sheet of three-ply lightweight plywood. The panel was about wide and long and molded into the shape of a canoe using hydraulic presses. The completed canoe, long, by beam and in depth, weighed , which was lighter than the average canvas-covered canoe of the same dimensions. The glue Haskell invented was with co-developer H.F. John and made from dried cow's blood. It was subjected to various tests to ensure it would be adequate for constructing canoes, as the boats would be in water for hours at a time. It was soaked in water for a lengthy time, boiled at high temperatures, and submerged in printer's ink. After getting good results from these experiments and tests, then the glue was employed in the making of the plywood used in the construction of the boats. The Haskell canoe was made from a sheet of three- ply haskelite plywood, of an inch thick. The panel sheet was first softened by boiling for three hours and then pressed into a canoe form by a molding machine. The slotted ends at the bow and stern were fastened together with a bent strip of ash. A hot steam process was used to form the inside belly double curvature of the bottom part of the canoe. Once the canoe dried it held that shape. The final process of construction was to attach the gunwales to the sides and seats to permanently form the canoe to a hull of one solid component. These canoes were first made in 1916 and put on the market for sale in 1917. The name of the manufacturer was the Haskell Boat Company, which was an organization managed by the Haskell Manufacturing Company. It was based at 801 N. Rowe Street in Ludington, Michigan. The peak production time for the manufacturing of the canoes was in the 1920s. In 1930 the length was extended to a long canoe instead of the original boat. A Haskell canoe in Washington DC, 2012  Marketing  The Haskell canoe was marketed and sold throughout the United States and Canada.

It was made from waterproof glue developed by Henry L. Haskell. The moldable plywood was originally called Ser- O-Ply. It was used in the construction of various vehicles including military tanks, boats, airplanes, buses, trucks, and automobiles. The plywood was manufactured with different characteristics depending on particular needs and then given a brand name.  Background  Haskell invented a process for making glue from blood-albumin. The process used slaughterhouse blood from the Chicago stock yards. The inexpensive waterproof adhesive was called \\"black albumin glue.\\" It was used to bond wood pieces. One product Haskell made from this was a lightweight waterproof plywood, first known as Ser-O-Ply. He applied this glue to wood veneers and manufactured plywood for various applications. Some of these applications were boats, airplanes, tanks, trucks, automobiles and rail cars. The plywood panels were from 1/8th inch up to an inch thick and had various layers of crossed grain ply veneers to create the thickness and strength. Typical moldable plywood panels were about five feet wide by twenty feet long and 3/16th of an inch thick. The plywood sheets made this way were eventually given the brand trade name of \\"Haskelite.\\" It is named after Henry L. Haskell, inventor of the glue bonding the plywood. Haskell formed a company for making plywood that ultimately became the Haskell Manufacturing Company in Ludington, Michigan and the Haskelite Manufacturing Corporation in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The glue was applied cold and spread onto wood veneers with rollers. A stack of three sheets of veneer was then put through a press, where each panel was subjected to a pressure of 150 psi between metal plates at . This pressure and heat made the bond between the veneers permanent and the glue became insoluble. The plywood was given brand names depending on its characteristics. Plymetl had metal faces and was used in construction of airtight clothes vaults for storing furs and expensive garments. Plymold was a plastic-based plywood that could be molded, and Phemaloid was a fire-resistant paneling.  Boats  1917 Haskell canoe Thinner moldable plywood was used to make watercraft. One model was the Haskell canoe. It was made from a type of plywood Haskell produced, consisting of veneers of birch on the outside and a redwood core. The unseamed canoe was made from a single piece of plywood; thousands were sold in the US. There were no ribs used in the building of the canoe.  Airplanes  Fairchild F-46 aircraft of 1938 Haskel plywood was used for aircraft parts, especially fuselages and wings. The first plane made with moldable plywood was constructed with Haskelite, and was the Curtiss two-place fighter Whistling Bill. Haskell plywood was used for construction of experimental and commercial aircraft. A Johnson Twin-60 experimental airplane was built in 1927 that had 85% Haskelite plywood in its wings, seats, instrument board, and fuselage parts. The first successful commercial airplane it was used on was the 1937 Fairchild Aircraft model F-46. The Haskelite company was considered Ludington's most important industry during World War I. The company made 5,000 military aircraft for the US and allies from 5,000,000 square feet of plywood produced. In 1927, the company manufactured aircraft body parts for Charles Linbergh's Spirit of St. Louis single engine plane. Haskelite's contributions during World War II were wooden aircraft body parts for US and ally airplanes. It made plywood parts for airplane trainers, gliders, bombers, and transports. Among these were plywood components for Britain's De Havilland Mosquito (\\"Wooden Wonder\\") fighter bombers. The manufacturing company also made wooden parts for Cessna Aircraft Company to use on their trainer airplanes. = Duramold = A Haskelite specialty plywood designed for aircraft construction called Duramold was invented in 1939. The new plastic plywood consisted of thin veneers of wood and cloth that were impregnated with formaldehyde and phenol and sandwiched with a synthetic resin. Heat and pressure were used to bold the materials together. The specialty plywood was only about one-third as heavy as the aluminum alloys then used in manufacturing airplanes. National Bureau of Standards tests proved that for its weight it was stronger than metal. The plastic plywood was waterproof and could readily be formed into compound curvatures. Processes had been developed so that an entire fuselage could be turned out in two halves. They then were sealed together mechanically. Wing assemblies also were molded with this process. The General Bakelite Company and Haskelite Manufacturing joined the Clark Aircraft Company of Hagerstown, Maryland in manufacturing planes using duramold. Aeronautical engineer Virginius E. Clark designed the planes. Aviator industrialist Howard Hughes helped finance the venture. One of these airplanes had received a commercial license to fly daily and 500 hours of testing proved its worthiness. The fuselage was molded in 2 hours 35 minutes, which was 1/30th the time required to construct an ordinary fuselage. It was without longitudinal or cross bracing. The entire fuselage weighed less than 120 pounds. It did not have rivet, screw, or nail heads projecting into the air stream. The plane had a 450 horsepower motor, fixed landing gear, and accommodations for five persons. Its top speed was and it cruised at . A typical airplane factory could manufacture parts of ten of these type planes a day. Then the specialty designed plywood wooden body parts could be assembled to complete the aircraft itself.

He founded the Blantyre Mission in Malawi. Henderson was the son of a Church of Scotland minister. He studied briefly at the University of Edinburgh, and then worked briefly in Queensland, Australia. In 1875, he volunteered to represent the Church of Scotland in an endeavour by the Free Church of Scotland to establish a mission in the Lake Malawi region in memory of medical missionary and explorer David Livingstone (1813-73). In 1876, Chief Kapeni gave Henderson land at modern Blantyre (named after Livingstone's birthplace) to create a Church of Scotland mission. There were difficulties in the early years: some of the missionaries had unrealistic expectations, and were indisciplined. In 1881, Rev. Duff MacDonald (who had headed the mission since 1878) and some other missionaries were dismissed. After the appointment of Rev. David C. Scott to head the mission, Henderson expanded its activities to Zomba, Domasi and Mulanje. He died in 1891, on a return journey to Scotland. A river steamer, Henry Henderson, purchased by Blantyre Mission in 1892, was named in his honour. She was manned by African graduates of the Mission, and operated as a floating church and school on Shire River, the largest river in Malawi. The Henry Henderson Institute, an educational institute in Blantyre, was named in his honour; it now lies within the grounds of St Michael and All Angels Church, Blantyre.

During World War II he flew 48 missions over occupied Europe in Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers. Early life Werner G. Goering was born on 1 January 1924, the son of Karl Goering, a gardener employed by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and his wife Adele. He had an older brother, Karl Jr. The family spoke German at home. Although Karl claimed to be the brother of the World War I flying ace (who was later the second most important figure in the Nazi government and head of the Luftwaffe) Hermann Göring, genealogical research conducted in 2010 showed that they were not related. Goering attended Horace Mann Junior High School and South High School in Salt Lake City, graduating near the bottom of his class. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor brought the United States into World War II, he volunteered for service in the United States Army Air Forces. After passing the required tests, he was accepted for flight training at Santa Ana Army Air Base in California. He then qualified as a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress pilot at Roswell Army Air Field in New Mexico. The claim that he was the nephew of Hermann Göring did not go unnoticed by the FBI. World War II At Fort Douglas Army Airfield in Utah, Goering, now a first lieutenant, took charge of his B17 crew. Unbeknown to him, his co-pilot, Second Lieutenant Jack P. Rencher, had instructions from the FBI to shoot Goering if he attempted to crash land or bail out over Germany or German occupied territory. Final training was completed at Dalhart Army Airfield in Texas, and MacDill Army Airfield in Florida. The crew traveled to England on the ocean liner RMS Aquitania, where they joined the 358th Bombardment Squadron, part of the 303d Bombardment Group, 41st Bombardment Wing, Eighth Air Force, based at RAF Molesworth. He acquired the nickname \\"Kraut\\". Goering flew a combat tour of 35 missions, then, at the end of 1944, volunteered for a second combat tour, and flew 14 more missions. He received the Distinguished Flying Cross. A 358th Bombardment Squadron B-17 on a bomb run On 21 November 1944, Rencher came close to putting his orders into effect. A shell passed through the cockpit, narrowly missing Rencher, but still deafening him and giving him a concussion. Goering ordered his copilot to conduct an oxygen check, in which each crew member reported that their oxygen was okay. Without oxygen, a crewman would pass out and soon die. When Chester \\"Chad\\" Brodzinski, the radio operator, did not reply, Rencher ordered the turret gunner, Orall R. \\"Gus\\" Gustafson to check on him. Gustafson found that Brodzinski's oxygen hose had been severed. He administered oxygen from a portable bottle, and then repaired the hose. Goering managed to bring the B-17 home safely. During a routine training flight on 7 December 1944 in the B-17 Mercy's Madhouse, the right landing gear collapsed, but Goering managed to steer the aircraft to a safe landing amid a shower of sparks and thick smoke. Another incident occurred when taking off for the bombing of Dresden on 15 February 1945. Taking off in dense fog, the unnamed B-17 he was flying got caught in prop wash from an adjacent runway, and pushed sideways. The plane crashed on takeoff, breaking into three parts. The bombardier suffered a broken arm and three other crewmen had minor injuries, but all managed to get clear before the plane exploded. During a raid on Buer on 22 March 1945, Goering was flying another unnamed aircraft when it was hit by flak which knocked out an engine, the intercom, and the oxygen system, and started an electrical fire in the cockpit. Goering donned a portable oxygen mask and put out the fire with a fire extinguisher. He completed his bombing run. On another mission, a shell passed clean through the port wing without exploding, or setting off the fuel. Goering pumped the fuel into the right wing. Later life Goering remained in the Army after the war ended, eventually transferring to the United States Air Force when it was formed in 1947. He married June Schott, one of his high school classmates, on 15 August 1946. They had two children, Carlinda and Scott. Due to his fluency in German, he was posted to Potsdam in the Soviet occupation zone of Germany, where he served as liaison offer to General Vasily Chuikov. He photographed a number of advanced aircraft, including the Ilyushin Il-28 bomber and the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17 fighter. During the 1950s, Goering flew the Boeing B-47 Stratojet bomber, a feared and difficult aircraft to fly, which caused the deaths of many airmen. He became intelligence officer of the 43d Bombardment Wing in 1956, and operations officer in 1959. In 1962, he was posted to Addis Ababa, in Ethiopia, as assistant Air Force attaché. Goering retired from the Air Force in 1964 with the rank of lieutenant colonel. He moved to Tucson, Arizona, where he became a realtor, subdividing ranches, and managed a ranch.

Early life Jacob Rutstein was born in Tolochin, Belarus as Yankev Rutstein. From an early age, Jacob's father took him to the Tolochin commodities market which dealt primarily in lumber. Jacob developed a keen business acumen, and by the age of twelve, he far exceeded his own father's business prowess. Travelogue To Tolochin During his teenage years, Rutstein was drafted into the Russian army after which he was recruited by a German company supervising the import of lumber into Western Europe. At eighteen, Rutstein was promoted to the General Manager of the Minsk Capital Region. Over time, Rutstein amassed a small fortune which he subsequently deposited in London.Id. In 1902, at the age of approximately twenty-five, Rutstein, fleeing religious persecution, immigrated to the United States via London. Unable to bring his assets from Europe into the United States, he settled in the Lower East Side of Manhattan bereft of his former fortune. Development of Brownsville, Brooklyn By 1909, Rutstein had migrated from the Lower East Side, where he had been working in a sweatshop for $3 a week, to Brownsville, Brooklyn, where he gained entry into the real estate industry. At the time, Brownsville, located in Eastern Brooklyn was a growing residential neighborhood with a large demand for modern housing. By 1912, Rutstein founded Brownsville Housewrecking Company which facilitated building demolition and from which he salvaged and sold used lumber. At the same time, Rutstein began acquiring land throughout Brooklyn - from Brownsville, Brooklyn to what would become Shore Road along the Belt Parkway. Rutstein's success in the wrecking and lumber businesses evolved into the formation, in 1922, of Brownsville Lumber. As Principal of Brownsville Lumber, Rutstein supplied lumber to New York's leading real estate families and began to experiment with doing his own building and development. The increased demand for lumber led Rutstein to acquire the raw source of timber. During the 1920s, Rutstein began to acquire lumber fields throughout the United States and as far away as Oregon. American Lumberman By owning the source of lumber, Rutstein was able to sell cheap lumber at reduced rates and undercut his competition throughout New York City. In control of the lumber supply, Rutstein was able to undertake large building campaigns throughout Brooklyn and especially in Brownsville, Brooklyn and Crown Heights. The New York Times described Rutstein as \\"a pioneer builder in the Brownsville-East New York section of Brooklyn.\\"Jacob Rutstein, 67, Leader in Brooklyn Prudential Lumber Corporation & The Nominal Measurement Revolution In 1930, in the midst of the depression, Rutstein formed the Prudential Lumber Corporation. Despite the collapse of the global economy as a result of the depression, demand for cheaper lumber increased not only in New York but nationally. Since 1918, Rutstein had been experimenting with cutting lumber logs along new nominal lumber measurements. Rutstein innovated an 11/4 wooden plank whereby the price of lumber was reduced 1/12 or about eight percent. At the time, most floor beams were 3/10 X 8/4 dressed four sides after going through a planner and the 8\\" or 10\\" wood 7 5/8 or 9 5/8\\" in width. Rutstein, who was influential over large lumber fields and mills, was able to convince others in the industry to instead cut the beams 2 ¾’ or 11/4 inches thick saving the ¼ thereby increasing efficiency by eight percent. By 1930, Rutstien was able to convince mills in the West Coast to adopt the standard and it was called colloquially as 'Jew Plank.' According to Jim Denison, in his history of the lumber industry, Rutstein \\"wanted this low-grade lumber to use for shoring for five stories of basement for parking lots, and a lot of those skyscrapers. So [people in the industry] called this Jew Plank that they cut, and it was a three-inch thickness, a rough cut, and put on ships. There were Calmar Lines that came into Newport, from the Suez Canal route, getting out to the West Coast. They brought steel out from the East Coast and delivered steel, and took lumber back to the East Coast again.\\" The History of the Lumber Industry This innovation would change the lumber industry and permanently adjust the structure of the lumber nominal measurements into modern times. It also made Rutstein millions. Philanthropy Rutstein's innovations to the nominal lumber size made him known in the lumber industry but it was his philanthropy for which he would be remembered. Rutstein was one of founders of Beth-El Hospital, Mesivta Rabbi Chaim Berlin, Brown Heights Yeshiva, United Lubavitcher Yeshiva, and a Director at Brooklyn Home of the Aged, Home for Incurables, Pride of Judea Orphans Home, Crown Heights Yeshiva, Jewish Theological Seminary, Brooklyn Jewish Center, Stone Ave. Talmud Torah. He was also a founder and member of Temple Petach Tikvah for more than 30 years and a charitable contributor to most of the Yeshivas in U.S., the Holy Land, and other countries. Beth-El Hospital Rutstein was a Principal Founder of Beth El Hospital and its predecessor, East New York Hospital. On Sunday, July 19, 1925, the Brooklyn Daily Eagle reported that for \\"the first time in Brownsville community work, $60,000 has been raised by 20 men especially for Brownsville and East New York Hospital to be used for the Nurses Home and Training School.\\" The article reports that the Chairman of the Building Committee, Jacob Rutstein, donated $5,000. On July 13, 1927, the Brooklyn Daily Eagle reported that opened a nurses training school. The article states, \\"Jacob Rutstein, chairman of the building committee, announced a $90,000 deficit was borne by the directors.\\" The article continues that a \\"gold key to the building was auctioned to Jacob Rutstein for $7,000.\\" On February 23, 1933, the Brooklyn Daily Eagle announced that Jacob Rutstein was named for a committee at Beth El hospital, formally known as Brownsville and East New York Hospital. On November 12, 1933, an article appears in which contains a picture of Jacob Rutstein. The caption provides, \\"Jacob Rutstein, prominent charitable worker and treasurer of the Beth-El Hospital is active in obtaining subscriptions reservations for the hospital's 10th annual dinner to be held at the Waldorf Astoria held on Sunday evening. December 3. This annual dinner attracts an attendance of 1,200 and the proceeds go to the annual deficit.\\" A similar article appeared on November 23, 1933, and on December 13, 1934. On December 15, 1934, another article appears describing the opening of the Beth- El Hospital bazar and states that Jacob Rutstein was chairman of the bazar committee and had help procure $50,000 worth of merchandise which will go towards the deficit of the hospital. A similar article regarding Beth El appears on November 1, 1937. Another article about an upcoming Beth El hospital dinner appears on May 5, 1940 representing every profession. The article cites Jacob Rutstein and states that Samuel Strausberg, acting president of the hospital, at a meeting of the dinner committee held last night, praised Mr. Rutstein for his untiring efforts in helping to make the dinner a huge success.\\" Mr. Strausberg added that from \\"early morning until late at night, Mr. Rutstein and his committee are giving up their own businesses in an effort to obtain subscriptions for the dinner.\\"\\"History of Brooklyn Jewry\\" Abelow, Saul Yeshiva Chaim Berlin Letter from Rabbi Nissen Telushkin about Jacob Rutstein Rutstein was a principal founder of Yeshiva Chaim Berlin and was critical in establishing Chaim Berlin Yeshiva in the United States. An article in the Brooklyn Eagle, on March 16, 1942, describes one of the many donations he acquired for the institution, stating that \\"$2,000 was raised in outside gifts by Jacob Rutstein who recently returned from Florida.\\" On December 11, 1944, another article appears in the Brooklyn Eagle which it states that, \\"Yesivah Rabbi Chaim Berlin, one of the largest Orthodox Jewish institutions of learning in the country, is dedicating its new seven-story building at Stone and Pitkin Ave. at ceremonies which will take place throughout the week. The opening ceremonies were attended by more than 3000 persons. Jacob Rutstein, chairman of the dedication committee, announced that $25,000 had been donated by those present towards the new $1,000,000 building.\\" On December 29, 1944, another article appeared stating the following about Rutstein: > \\"Our congratulations to Jacob Rutstein for his constant activity on > organizing activities for the advancement of orthodox Jewish secular and > religious education. Outstanding in his philanthropic activities is his > recent purchase of the seven-story $1,000,000 building at 350 Stone Ave. for > the Mesivtah and Yeshivah Rabbi Chaim Berlin in the heart of Brownsville. > Already the institution has been recognized by the State Board of Regents > through the granting of a charter and 800 students are now enrolled.

This has been a truly humanitarian endeavor on the part > of Mr. Rutstein.\\" Lubavitch Rutstein played a role in bringing Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn, the sixth Lubavitcher rebbe, to the United States. Schneersohn, who was fleeing Nazi persecution, needed refuge in the United States. Rutstein worked with other leaders of the Jewish community to help bring Rabbi Schneersohn to the United States. Once in the United States, Rutstein is reported to have assisted Rabbi Schneersohn in launching Lubavitch in America. In addition to being a founder of the United Lubavitch Yeshivas, Rutstien helped Lubavitch locate and purchase the building which would become its headquarters on 770 Eastern Parkway. A picture of Rutstein hung in the Lubavitcher headquarters until the first half of the 1950s. Jacob's son, Nathan Rothstein, a real estate attorney, represented Lubavitch and did the closing of legal documents on the building. The Redstone Group Rutstein had numerous children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren, many of whom continued in the real estate industry. Over four generations, the family included restaurateurs, developers, real estate attorneys and financiers. The multi-generational level of experience of the Rutstein family in the real estate sector ultimately evolved into The Redstone Group, a closely held family company, which draws upon a century of experience in the real estate industry.

It employs high set counts and moderate repetitions. GVT workouts typically involve 10 sets of 10 repetitions focused on a specific muscle group.  Muscle building  GVT training programs emphasize different muscle groups each day in order to work the targeted muscle groups close to their breaking points, causing the body to build muscle mass quickly. GVT is a mainstream bodybuilding program and can be done at a frequency suitable to the trainee. Guidelines ensure trainer safety - rest is important between sets, and should last between 60 and 90 seconds. During the set the lifter must also consider the amount of weight. For any given exercise, only about 60% of the lifter's one rep max should be used. For example, if a lifter's maximum bench press amount is 100 pounds (45 kg) then they should only lift 60 pounds (27 kg) for each rep. Another important consideration when using this type of training program is recovery time. Most training programs involve daily training, whereas GVT recommends 5 days of workouts each week. Since each day a different muscle group is targeted and worked to near exhaustion, the soreness of that muscle may feel more intense and recovery may take longer than normal. On the 6th day, the regimen starts over, giving the lifter 2 days off for muscle recovery. The GVT program typically helps put on mass, and does not necessarily help improve the lifter's one rep max. German volume training could also involve a set of muscles targeted in a day. For example, in one day, lifter can train his back and legs. Usually complimentary muscle groups are chosen to reduce the strain on muscles.

Her family moved to the United States after their conversion in order to congregate with the main body of members of the church in Nauvoo, Illinois. Once the family had enough money, they sailed to America. On their journey, there were storms and rough seas. Garner recorded that the trip took seven weeks and she was seasick for most of that time. They arrived in Nauvoo, and her family rented a house because they could not afford to build their own. Her father also died while the family was living there. She met Joseph Smith and other early church leaders. She records that she had long red, curly hair. When she was eight, Garner attended Smith's funeral after he was martyred. She was also present at the meeting after Smith's death in which Brigham Young appeared and sounded like Smith. Pioneer In 1846, the members of the church in Nauvoo were driven out of Illinois by anti-Mormon mobs. Garner recorded that in September 1846, a mob of 200 men came to Nauvoo. A group of about 400 Latter Day Saints, including her brother, fought them off for three days until they surrendered the city to the mob. After the mob attack, Garner's family left the city for some time. They were informed later by the mob, however, that they could return to Nauvoo. They did so, crossing the Mississippi River when it was iced over. They lived in a double house with the Lee family. Garner witnessed the burning of the Nauvoo Temple by another mob in 1848. Her family later rented a house from a Mrs. Kimball. Garner met one of Kimball's friends, Mrs. Holridge, and lived with her in Burlington, Iowa, for about three years. The rest of Garner's family eventually joined her as they traveled towards the Salt Lake Valley. Garner's family moved to Council Bluffs, Iowa, where she met her future husband, William Garner Jr. She lived there for two seasons, as she recorded in her autobiography. In 1850, she migrated to Utah with her family. She records that on their journey, she was bothered by Native Americans who wanted to take her with them. She tells of the strict rations that were placed on their food. On their journey, many talked about the lives they had left behind in Nauvoo and the persecution of the saints there. She even helped drive a team of oxen across the plains. For the majority of their trek, she walked because there wasn't space in the wagon. They settled in Weber County, Utah. They arrived at Emigration Canyon, Utah, at night. On their first morning it snowed, but they were welcomed by the saints in the area with a hot breakfast. In her autobiography she records that the crops of 1854 and of 1855 failed due to grasshoppers and droughts. However, the saints were willing to share their food and other goods with one another and survived. An Indian Chief even followed her home on one occasion and proposed marriage, but she refused. The family lived for some time in Slaterville, Utah, where Garner became reacquainted with William, whose father was one of the first converts to the church in England. She married William Garner Jr. on November 1, 1856. William was a farmer and was called on a mission for the church in 1882. The couple had ten children. In 1857, Garner recorded that she saw Johnston's Army pass through Utah. She and William had five children in Slaterville, and then they moved to Hooper, Utah, where her other five children were born. Garner was an active member of the LDS Church throughout her life. She served as a Relief Society leader in her ward and participated in many other church activities. She continued to share her belief in Mormonism with others. Later life Garner's husband died in 1915. For some time she lived with her daughter-in-law, but was active and could take care of herself until she fell and broke her right hip. Even at an old age, she did not wear glasses and was in good health. She had only seen a doctor once in her life before her fall. Garner died on July 20, 1943, in Hooper. At the time of her death, she was the oldest Utah resident and the eldest member of the church. She was also the last living acquaintance of Joseph Smith. She left behind over 600 lineal descendants, and four of her children were still living when she died.

It consists of a large gold torc, known as the Havor Ring, along with several well-preserved bronze objects and was buried inside a Roman bronze situla in the mound surrounding a hillfort. In 1986, the Havor Ring was stolen from the Gotland Museum. , it has not been recovered.  Location  The hillfort in the small village of Havor in Hablingbo is located in a meadow about northeast of the main building at Stora Havor farm. The fort was built more than 2000 years ago during the Pre-Roman Iron Age. At that time it was situated on the south banks of the lake that later became Mästermyr mire. The hillfort is surrounded by a round mound or wall in diameter, about high and wide. On top of the mound, there are traces of a wooden palisade and outside it are traces of a grave. Close by are also a couple of Iron Age house foundations and in one of these seven denarii minted in 112–192 AD were found. Archaeological excavations of the area in 1961–80, revealed that the site had been continuously inhabited from the Bronze Age until the Middle Ages.  Discovery  The hoard was discovered on the first day of an archaeological excavation in April 1961, by a couple of workers who were removing turf from the mound around the hillfort. The excavation was a relief work project provided by Havdhem Municipality. Two men found a vessel containing several objects and \\"something that looked like gold\\" under a flat stone on the inside of the mound. As there was no archaeologist present that day, they put the stone back and shoveled some dirt over it and continued to dig elsewhere. The next day archaeologists took control of the site and police had to keep press, TV crews and spectators at bay. The excavation supervisor, then archaeology student Peter Manneke, was credited with the find. Manneke phoned his boss, professor Erik Nylén, who was in Stockholm at the time and he immediately flew to Gotland. To guard the find Manneke and Nylén spent the night in sleeping bags by the hoard. The hoard was brought to Gotland Museum where it went on public display in the Treasury (Skattkammaren) for the next 25 year. At first it was displayed in a custom built iron case with armored glass and in the mid 1980s it was moved to an ordinary glass alarmed showcase.  Find  The find consisted of a large Roman bronze vessel with a handle, a situla, which held a large gold torc, four Roman wine cups resembling modern tastevins, a bronze strainer and two bronze bells. The hoard was from about 100 AD and all the objects were exceptionally well preserved. On the handle of the situla were stamps reading \\"TOR, CANNIMASUIT, (P CI)PI POLYB and IPI(?)\\". The two bells were tied together with leather straps into a rattle. No official archaeological report was written on the Havor hoard or the excavation of the site at the time of the find. = Havor Ring = The gold torc, known as the Havor Ring (Havorringen) was made in the 1st century. It, along with other neck rings of this kind, were previously believed to be of western Celtic or southeast European origin, but it is now concluded that the Havor Ring could have been made in the Nordic countries. , it is the earliest known well-dated major gold ornament in the Germanic north. The torc is in diameter and weighs close to , with a gold value of about SEK 40,000–50,000 in 2006. However, the value of the neck ring as a historic art object is estimated at tens of million SEK. A copy of it was made for a display at the Swedish History Museum in Stockholm. Because of its size, the torc is considered a unique object. It is too large to be worn by a person and it is believed to have adorned a statue of a deity and was part of a treasure belonging to a temple. Five similar but smaller torcs have been found; one in Trollhättan, one in a bog on Jutland, two near Kiev and one at Olbia by the Black Sea. The Havor Ring is the most richly decorated and technically most complicated of the six torcs with a ring-body made from several twisted gold wires figure-8-shaped filigree ornamentation on the cones by the claps orbs. The gold wires of the ring section were twisted around a core-rod which was later removed. This made the torc very flexible when opening and closing the clasp mechanism hidden within the front orbs. The cones on the front of the ring are decorated with bullheads and half-moons made of gold sheet, surrounded by small gold grains and twisted gold wires in a filigree pattern.  Theft  On 18June 1986, the Havor Ring was stolen during visiting hours from the Gotland Museum. The circumstances of the theft have been described as \\"mysterious\\". On that day, the alarm in the Treasury was activated twice. After the first time, at 12pm, the antiquarian in charge of security found everything in order and the alarm was reset. At 12:45pm the alarm went off again. This time the antiquarian noticed that a latch on the lock was recessed, meaning that the showcase was unlocked, but she did not notice that the torc was gone. She locked the case and reset the alarm again. The theft was discovered at noon the next day. According to the police, the lock had been picked or opened with a key. The police immediately sent out a nationwide alert about the missing torc and contacted Interpol. A SEK 25,000 reward was offered for information leading to the recovery of the neck ring. A young man who had been seen in the Treasury was suspected of the theft, but he was never found. In the late 1990s, the crime was investigated on the Swedish TV show Efterlyst (\\"Wanted\\"). Several persons have been interviewed and investigated about the crime over the years but without results. The theft is now prescribed but even if the police have no ongoing investigation about it, tips from the public are still coming into the Visby police department. Since 2015, two private investigators have been looking for the torc; a former intelligence agent and a forensic scientist, both retired. Their focus has been on a former employee at the museum – a now deceased archaeologist who was convicted of multiple antiquities thefts and sentenced to psychiatric care after having been diagnosed with kleptomania. About a year after the theft, a copy of the torc was made from the copy at the History Museum. , that second copy is displayed in the Gotland Museum along with the bronze objects from the hoard.

The project ended in 1858 because it was mismanaged, and the Keokuk and Des Moines River Railroad was being developed to cover the same territory at the same time. Two dams had also been completed, but they have since been removed. Even though the project was never completed, navigation was possible via the locks as far upriver as Keosauqua. Lock No. 5 was begun in 1849 and completed in 1852. It was built by Meeks and Sons from Bonaparte. Beginning at the lower end, the remnants of this structure include of the outside wall and of the inside wall. They are both to thick. The recesses for the lower gates are still visible, as are some of the iron rings that were used to tie boats to the sides. At a later date, stone from the side walls was used to create a third wall across the lower end of the lock in an attempt to stabilize the structure. The lock itself is now silted in. Lock No. 7 was begun circa 1851 and was not completed until 1856 because of major structural problems. Keosauqua contractor Bonney and Whittelsey was responsible for its construction. Only one wall, long and wide, remains from what was the landside wall. It is surrounded by a farm field and a grove of trees about from the river bank. The walls for both locks are composed of large blocks of locally quarried limestone that are set on a foundation of limestone bedrock. The locks were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. In 1989 Lock No. 5 was included as a contributing property in the Bonaparte Historic Riverfront District.

Wavre did research on, among other subjects, logic and the philosophy of mathematics, in which he was an adherent of Brouwer's intuitionism. Independently of, and almost simultaneously with, Leon Lichtenstein, he dealt with equilibrium figures of a heterogeneous fluid mass, with a view to applications to planetary systems in astrophysics. In 1932 in Zürich he was a plenary speaker at the ICM with talk L’aspect analytique du problème des figures planétaires. He was an invited speaker at the ICM in 1920 in Strasbourg, in 1928 in Bologna, and in 1936 in Oslo. For the two years 1936 and 1937 he was the president of the Swiss Mathematical Society.

All three vehicles were set ablaze and completely engulfed in fire after the collision on the main road linking the capital, Kabul, to the southern city of Kandahar.

Many of the injured were very seriously injured and in critical condition.  Aftermath  Mohammadullah Ahmadi, the director of the provincial traffic department, said the crash was caused by reckless driving. Local residents helped fire fighters and first responders pull survivors from the wreckage. Health ministry spokesman Ismail Kawasi said that most of those who died in the crash were \\"completely burned beyond recognition\\". The dead included many women and children. The vehicles were completely gutted and clouds of acrid smoke shrouded the scene of the crash on the Kabul-Kandahar highway. There were around 125 people travelling on the buses. Drivers often speed on the highway to avoid insurgent activity, especially from the Taliban. The speed is to avoid the checkpoints that the Taliban set up, where they sometimes kidnap and kill civilians, such is what happened during the Kunduz-Takhar highway hostage crisis where hundreds were kidnapped and many killed after they were captured at a Taliban checkpoint.

It was relocated in 2008 from its original location at 475 North Bowling Green Way in Brentwood, Los Angeles thanks to the efforts of Barbara Behm.

Her practice room is farthest away from the composers study. There is a nice integration of sloping and flat roofs with the introduction of a glass triangle into the redwood siding. It was with this project that Neutra first experimented with the peaked roof and triangular glazed gable openings that later became a trademark of the firm when pitched roofs were mandated by city building codes.

John Hall at his home N. John Hall (born 1933) is an American biographer and scholar best known for his books on Anthony Trollope and Max Beerbohm. In addition, Hall has published many articles, editions, introductions, and book chapters on both Trollope and Beerbohm. In his later career, Hall has written a memoir and two novels. Education Hall graduated with a B.A. and M.A. from Seton Hall (1955 and 1967), and a Ph.D. from New York University (1970). Career Hall was a Professor of English at Bronx Community College of the City University of New York (1970-2010) and at the CUNY Graduate Center (1980-2010). In 1983, CUNY named him Distinguished Professor; upon retirement in 2011, he became CUNY Distinguished Professor Emeritus. Hall has received numerous scholarly awards including fellowships from the National Endowment for the Humanities; the American Council of Learned Societies; and, from the Guggenheim Foundation in 1976 and 1984. Hall started his scholarly career with several books on Anthony Trollope. This interest began in graduate school where his dissertation was an annotated edition of a never-before-published book of social criticism by Trollope (1855–56). This work was brought out as The New Zealander in 1972. Hall followed this publication with various editions and books on Trollope including Trollope and His Illustrators (Macmillan, 1980). In 1983, he published the first complete edition of Trollope’s letters. His work on Trollope culminated in Trollope: a Biography (Oxford University Press, 1991), an authoritative work that Anthony Burgess called the \\"a kind of thanksgiving” and which prompted Clive Davis in The Times to assert that Hall was \\"arguably the world's leading Trollope scholar.\\" Hall went on to publish extensively on Max Beerbohm, including an art book, Max Beerbohm Caricatures (Yale, 1997) and a biography, Max Beerbohm: A Kind of a Life (Yale, 2002), which the New York Times called “an attractively spry romp around Beerbohm’s life and repute.” Observing Hall's distinctive approach to his biographical subjects, Thomas Hodgkinson wrote, “Sooner or later everybody gets the biography they deserve.” Hall himself noted that the biography of Trollope was \\"long, inclusive,\\" and as \\"impersonal\\" as possible; whereas the Beerbohm biography was \\"quite different--short, selective and personal.\\" His recent books include Belief: A Memoir (Beil, 2007) and two connected epistolary novels, Correspondence: An Adventure in Letters (Godine, 2011) and Bibliophilia: A Novel (Godine, 2016). Of Correspondance, Colleen Mondor writes that the book “serves as an armchair education on Victorian literature. . . . These are literary lessons at their most amiable and a tonic to the chaos of the world around us.\\" In addition, Hall has edited and introduced many books for Oxford World’s Classics, Yale University Press, Arno Press, and others. Hall was a regular member of the graduate faculty in English at the CUNY Graduate Center where he taught courses in 19th-century fiction, specializing in the novel, and where he supervised many Ph.D.s. But Hall also simultaneously taught for decades at a CUNY community college in the South Bronx, in one of the poorest congressional districts in the United States where he typically worked with under-resourced and under-prepared college students. Some have seen Hall's scholarly accomplishments as a strange distinction for a community college English professor. As Burgess noted, Hall's immersion in Trollope's world \\"must be very comforting to a man who works in the Bronx.” And Gene Maeroff, too, observed that Hall's scholarly writing is \\"removed from the needs of students who must undergo remedial studies.\\" Hall, however, did not regard his community college teaching as a scholarly contradiction: \\"'There ought to be serious, productive scholars at a community college,' said Dr. Hall, who has turned down job offers from four- year institutions. 'Otherwise, the students will once again feel shortchanged.'\\" Bibliography =Books= * The New Zealander. (Editor). Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1972. * Trollope and His Illustrators.

It contains the Valley of the Dinosaurs Area of Relevant Ecological Interest, a sustainable use area of relevant ecological interest. This in turn contains the smaller and fully protected Valley of the Dinosaurs Natural Monument. In 2015–16 there was concern that renovations to the tourist attraction, which had been delayed through lack of funding, might not be respecting the integrity of the site. Location The Valley of the Dinosaurs is an area in the sedimentary basin of the Peixe River that holds over 50 types of ancient animal tracks, including those of stegosaurus, allosaurus and iguanodons. The valley covers an area of about that includes the city of Sousa, Paraíba, and ten other municipalities. It is in a Caatinga biome. Tracks have been found in about 30 locations in the valley, with fossilized footprints of over 80 species at about 20 different stratographic levels. Most of the tracks are of carnivorous dinosaurs. The tracks the dinosaurs made in the damp earth beside ponds and rivers in rainy periods hardened over long periods of drought, gained new layers of sand and clay from floods, and fossilized. Footprints are as small as , perhaps from dinosaurs the size of modern chickens, up to long, such as that of a four-ton iguanodon. The most visited site is the island called the Passagem das Pedras (Crossing of Stones) in the bed of the Peixe River. This is about from the urban centre of Sousa. History The dinosaur tracks were discovered by a local farmer, Anísio Fausto Silva, in the late 19th century. At the start of the 20th century the engineer Luciano Jacques de Moraes began to study them scientifically. Although not a trained palaeontologist, Moraes gave detailed descriptions with drawings of the tracks for publication in the book Serras e Montanhas do Nordeste (1924). The Área de Relevante Interesse Ecológico Vale dos Dinossauros was established on 18 December 1984 and is administered by the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio). The protected area covers . It is in the Sousa municipality of the state of Paraíba. The Valley of the Dinosaurs Natural Monument was created in 2002 by the municipality of Souza. This is a fully protected natural monument of about . There were plans to divert the Peixe River, which flooded the tracks in the rainy season. A R$1.3 million renovation was funded by the federal government and Petrobras, and the site was reopened on 24 May 2013. Work included renovation of the museum, restructuring of the exhibition space, auditorium, offices and bathrooms, and changes to the external area including delimitation of parking spaces, paving of paths and walkways and upgrades to lookout gazebos to meet accessibility standards. Suspended walkways let the visitors view 50 fossilized footprints of the carnivorous noasauridae and 53 of the herbivore Iguanodon. Conservation The Area of Relevant Ecological Interest is classed as IUCN protected area category IV (habitat/species management area), whose purpose is to maintain natural ecosystems of regional or local importance and regulate use of these areas to make it compatible with the nature conservation objectives. In December 2015 it was reported that the Valley of the Dinosaurs was in a state of neglect, and renovations had been suspended. The replica of Tyrannosaurus Rex had been destroyed, access roads were covered by scrub, there were hundreds of cobblestones around the entrance, piles of sand and other problems. Reporters found that the work had been abandoned due to delays in releasing funding to the company charged with work on the site. In February 2016 the Federal Public Ministry (MPF) in Sousa recommended that Paraíba Office of Environment Administration (SUDEMA) prepare the management plan for the natural monument within 90 days defining steps to ensure the integrity and protection of natural resources of the site, and steps taken to integrate it into the social and economic life of the surrounding communities. The MPF also recommended that SUDEMA give a detailed report within 30 days on the work carried out by the Sousa Prefecture in the Valley of Dinosaurs, which should be limited to protecting the integrity of the unit. If the prefecture's work was not limited to this, MPF said that SUDEMA should take administrative measures to stop the work.

The newspaper was originally owned and run in partnership by two local pastoralists Auber George Jones and Thomas Darlow and the paper's first editor was an Oxford graduate named Frank Hutchison. As the district of Wagga Wagga grew in prosperity and importance, Jones and Darlow viewed the newspaper as a means to provide the region with greater representation in the press. The paper aimed to highlight the importance of agriculture and was devoted to people from all socio- economic levels. The partnership of Jones and Darlow was dissolved in 1871 and the paper was sold to the partnership of Stephen Sullivan and his father-in- law, J. Mackay. Sullivan had originally joined the paper as a printer when he was twenty one years old and the paper remained under ownership of two generations of the Sullivan family until 1953. On 27 January 1880, due to popular demand, the frequency of The Wagga Wagga Advertiser was increased to tri-weekly published Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. The price of the paper was reduced in 1881 from 6 pence to 2 pence, to make it more affordable and on 31 December 1910 it became a daily publication. Under the ownership of Stephen Sullivan, the offices of the newspaper were relocated from Fitzmaurice Street to Trail Street and on 3 January 1911 the Advertiser became The Daily Advertiser. Publisher Stephen Sullivan spoke of the positive reception the move to a daily publication had received: \\"Since the announcement of daily publication of the paper, the proprietor has received manifestations of good will from all parts of the district, general satisfaction being expressed with a move in keeping with the rapid growth of the community\\". * 1911 - The Daily Advertiser is first published.

It is the third film in the Blair Witch series and a direct sequel to the 1999 film The Blair Witch Project, ignoring the events of its 2000 follow-up film Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2, given the events of that film being a film within a film. Blair Witch stars James Allen McCune, Callie Hernandez, Brandon Scott, Corbin Reid, Valorie Curry, and Wes Robinson. The film, shot in a found footage style, follows a group of college students and their local guides who venture into the Black Hills Forest in Maryland to uncover the mysteries surrounding the prior disappearance of Heather Donahue, the sister of one of the characters. Development of the film began in September 2009, when creators of the franchise Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez announced their intent to produce a third Blair Witch film. The film was a sequel to the first film, would potentially contain the actors from the first film in some context, and would not reference any of the events from Book of Shadows. In 2011, Sánchez remarked that further development on a sequel depended on getting Lionsgate to approve the idea and for his and Myrick's schedule to match up. The film went into development hell, and later the script was thrown aside. In 2013, a third Blair Witch film was again in talks, with Wingard and Barrett being hired to work on a new script. Initially, the film's connection to the Blair Witch franchise was kept secret, with the film having been shot under the fake title, The Woods. In July 2016, it was revealed at the 2016 San Diego Comic- Con that the film marketed with the faux-title The Woods actually turned out to be the sequel Blair Witch. The film premiered at San Diego Comic-Con on July 22, 2016 and was screened at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 11, before being theatrically released in the United States on September 16, by Lionsgate. Blair Witch received mixed reviews, with critics noting it as an improvement on Book of Shadows while criticizing the writing and special effects. While the film grossed $45 million against a budget of $5 million, it was considered a box office disappointment, given that the original film had grossed nearly $250 million in 1999 against a budget of $60,000. Plot In 2014, James Donahue finds a video on YouTube containing an image of a woman he believes to be his sister Heather, who disappeared in 1994 near Burkittsville, Maryland while investigating the legend of the Blair Witch. Believing she is still alive, he heads into the woods, accompanied by his friend Peter Jones, Peter's girlfriend Ashley Bennett, and film student Lisa Arlington, who wants to film James' search as a documentary, The Absence of Closure. Locals Talia and Lane, who found and uploaded the video, join them. While walking through the woods and upon setting up camp for the night, Lane and Talia discuss the disappearance of Heather and her film crew, the 1940-41 murders by Rustin Parr, and other mysterious occurrences, which they ascribe to the Blair Witch. They hear noises during the night, then awaken at 2 p.m. to find strange stick figures hanging from the trees. When Lisa notices twine in Lane's backpack, he and Talia admit to creating the figures in order to convince the group to believe, but also point out that there is no explanation for the strange noises during the night and sleeping through the day. James and his friends banish Lane and Talia from the group and head out of the woods. After hours of walking, the four surprisingly arrive back at their original campsite. Lisa pilots a drone to obtain their location, but it malfunctions. Ashley becomes sick due to a wound on her foot, forcing the group to camp again. When Peter inspects Ashley's wounded foot, he notices what he thinks may be a parasite inside the wound. Peter leaves the camp for firewood, and is chased by an unknown entity; a tree falls on him, then he disappears. Lane and Talia appear in the night, claiming they have been wandering for five days without a sunrise. Lane believes the camp is a hallucination and runs off, leaving the disheveled and ravenously hungry Talia. The next morning, James and Lisa are stunned to find that it is still dark outside at 7am and discover larger stick figures. Talia sees clumps of her hair tied to one of the figures. Ashley accuses Talia of crafting them and snaps the figure with Talia's hair in half; Talia herself is then snapped in half. An unseen force lifts their tent and the group is separated. Ashley finds the drone and climbs a tree to recover it, but is knocked out and falls from the tree, the unknown entity dragging her away. A rainstorm ensues as Lisa and James stumble across Rustin Parr's house, which James had previously stated to have been burned down after his execution. James hears someone he thinks is Heather scream upstairs, enters the house and sees Peter standing in the corner. He chases after the figure he believes to be Heather, confronted by a teleporting disheveled figure; upon its vanishing he barricades himself. Lisa spots a tall, pale, long-limbed creature moving through the trees, and she runs into the house's basement. She finds a hostile Lane who traps her in a tunnel, saying, “you have to do what she tells you.” She crawls through the tunnel to a different part of the house, where she stabs and kills Lane when he attacks her. Lisa flees when the long-limbed creature emerges from the tunnel and chases her through the house. Lisa runs up to the attic with Lane's camcorder, creating the paradox video that lured them all to the woods. She reunites with James in the attic and they try to barricade the door. A bright light shines from outside the building. James tells Lisa to face the corner of the room and desperately apologizes to her before something enters the room. James is tricked into turning around, believing that he hears Heather's voice, and vanishes from sight. Lisa uses Lane's camcorder to view what is behind her and begins walking backward. However, hearing James' apology again, she turns and vanishes, with a flash of a yellowed arm, before her camera falls to the ground. After a few moments, the camera gives out.

Although nothing came of the meeting at the time, a few months later, Wingard and Barrett were asked to meet with Lionsgate to potentially work in a secret project. Barrett recalled that, in the initial pitch meeting, Lionsgate had already crafted a story for a new Blair Witch film, and simply asked if they would be interested in making it. Barrett said that the \\"only thing I really pitched was the other characters; they’d originally conceived the film as more similar to the first film, following its narrative fairly closely, with only three or four characters, I think, but I wanted more characters to give us more scare sequences. I also wanted a unique dynamic within the group from the start, so I pitched the idea of introducing some Burkittsville locals to the group.\\" Barrett would later note that the team found the found footage genre more challenging, as they have only previously worked with it on the V/H/S anthology movies. Barrett noted that with the V/H/S series, there was an inherent entertainment value, where the segments \\"were never meant to feel entirely real\\", an element that did not work for the Blair Witch series. Speaking on the issue to Bloody Disgusting, Barrett stated \\"even if our scares didn’t work in V/H/S, hopefully people would still be entertained, and if they weren’t, well, another short would start in a few minutes\\"; he added that if a scare did not work in Blair Witch, \\"we’d have nothing to fall back on, we’d just have failed completely, and publicly.\\" To prevent this from happening, Barrett and Winger extensively went over each \\"scare\\" to discover why it was scary and how the audience would react to it. For some sequences, multiple approaches were tried differently, \\"to give us options in the editing room.\\" =Filming= Principal photography took place in the spring of 2015, in a set of woods in British Columbia in Canada. Scenes taking place in the famous Blair Witch House were shot in a sound stage where the House was entirely built. =Connections to The Blair Witch Project= Prior to the film's premiere at the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con, the fact that the film was a Blair Witch sequel remained a closely guarded secret, as the film was shot under the title The Woods. According to the film's writer, Barrett, the film's secrecy was done to prevent backlash among Internet commenters, who the filmmakers felt would react negatively to news of a reboot. Prior to the official premiere, Lionsgate went as far as to release a trailer for the film incorporating actual footage, while still keeping the film's lineage a secret. The film was still publicly known as The Woods even at Comic-Con, prior to its first screening, with io9 reporting that the initial theater for the screening was filled with posters for the fake film. After the screening (during which audiences realized that the film was a sequel), all the promotional material in the theater was changed to reflect the film's actual title. Release The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 11, 2016 and was theatrically released on September 16, 2016. Reception =Box office= Blair Witch grossed $20.8 million in North America and $24.4 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $45.2 million, against a production budget of $5 million. In the United States and Canada, the film was released on September 16, 2016, and was initially projected to gross at least $20 million with a chance to get as high as $26 million in its opening weekend, from 3,121 theaters. Lionsgate's expectations were more conservative, however, with a projected $15–18 million opening, although rival studios were predicting significantly higher numbers, noting how horror films saw solid performances throughout 2016, including Lights Out, The Conjuring 2, The Purge: Election Year, The Shallows and Don't Breathe. However, after grossing $765,000 from its Thursday previews and $4.1 million on its first day, opening projections were lowered to $10 million. It ended up grossing $9.7 million in its opening weekend, below expectations and the lowest opening weekend of the series. The film was considered a box office disappointment by analysts. The film received a day-and-date release in many countries in conjunction with its North American debut. The film cost $5 million to produce, with an additional $20 million spent on promotion, advertising and marketing costs. =Critical response= Blair Witch received mixed reviews, with critics noting it as an improvement on Book of Shadows while criticizing the writing and special effects. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 37% based on 216 reviews, with an average rating of 5.18/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Blair Witch doles out a handful of effective scares, but aside from a few new twists, it mainly offers a belated rehash of the original – and far more memorable – first film.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 47 out of 100, based on 41 critics. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"D+\\" on an A+ to F scale. According to Entertainment Weeklys Joey Nolfi, while Blair Witch is generally regarded as an improvement over Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2, \\"moviegoers and film journalists essentially told [Blair Witch] to stand in the corner...critical reviews and audience exit polling...are still some of the worst of any 2016 release thus far.\\" Michael Roffman of Consequence of Sound wrote that \\"Nothing [about the film] is scary, nothing is remotely disturbing, and there’s this boring familiarity to the proceedings, namely because it’s more or less a beat-by-beat remake of the original.\\" The Hollywood Reporter's Leslie Felperin criticized the film, commenting that it is \\"a dull retread rather than a full- on reinvention,\\" enlarging the cast numbers this time but sticking to the same basic beats. Scott Tobias of GQ felt that the makers of Blair Witch made a poor decision by making the film less subtle than the original. Thomas Simpson of the Rock River Times said that the film \\"lacks any real scares\\" and that, after watching it, \\"you shouldn’t have any issues turning the light off at night.\\" The New York Posts Kyle Smith condemned the film by saying that \\"the take-away from Blair Witch is not terror, but sorrow,\\" and gave it 1.5 stars out of 4. Josh Kurp of Uproxx gave the film a mixed review, saying \\"Blair Witch is scary, but it lacks surprise, and without surprise, you’re left with a bunch of kind-of annoying people shakily filming themselves wandering the woods and reacting to loud noises.\\" Mark Kermode gave the film three out of five stars in a review for The Guardian, calling it \\"efficient if unadventurous.\\" Vanity Fairs Jordan Hoffman felt that the film was inferior to You're Next, a previous film by Wingard and writer Simon Barrett, and said Blair Witchs \\"jump-scares [will] make for a fun night at the movies, but it’s like chomping on White Castle hamburgers—when this creative team has previously served us a prime rib.\\" Conversely, IGN reviewer Chris Tilly declared that Blair Witch is \\"so good it'll make you forget that Book of Shadows ever happened.\\" Mark Eccleston of Glamour wrote that the film has \\"genuine, jarring scares...and an unsettling late surprise that makes it well worth popping to you nearest multiplex to have the holy crap scared out of you.\\" Bloody Disgusting's Brad Miska writes, \\"Blair Witch is that game-changer horror fans desperately have been waiting for.\\" Miska gave the film a 4.5 out of 5 rating, and included it in his list of the \\"Best Horror Films of 2016\\". Soundtrack The soundtrack was released on September 16, 2016 via Lakeshore Records, concurrent with the film's release.

History Abreu moved to Chicago, Illinois in 1994 and during his time in this city, Abreu's artistic talent and direction soon matured. The product of this artistic maturation was the creation of a style he calls Psycho - Expressionism. He named the style Psycho-Expressionism, short for psychological-expressionism, as a way to reveal that his works entertain psychological phenomena in a heavily emotive style, unique to expressionism. Interpretation Psycho-Expressionism is a culmination of distinct symbols that continually present themselves in Oscar Abreu's works. These symbols that are formulated through brush strokes, vivid colors, scratches and collages represent elements which Abreu believes make the human psyche. For example, a pattern that has manifested itself in Abreu’s most recent paintings is a set of small squares that surround a central figure. The central figure usually symbolizes a particular memory or psychological state. The squares account for routine and history; two components of the mind that according to Oscar Abreu, are not consciously entertained, but that play an integral part in the formation of our personalities. Thus, he places these squares adjacent to the solid background. He represents his squares with contrasting colors, or within the same domain of the background color, to expose and represent situations which we find ourselves every day. The central figure is constructed with layers of colors, painted one on top of the other. After this is done he uses a spatula and scratches certain areas of the figure, with the intention to make clear that there is a past. Through the scratches, hints of different and previous color layers are revealed. This is symbolic of the evolutionary processes that transform our personalities and of our psychological histories. Abreu paints in a piecemeal fashion to entertain the idea of reductionism. Analysis of his work reveals that in most cases his use of various colors represent emotions. The abstracted parts of his work represent the subconscious. The representational parts represent consciousness. The positioning of the subject’s head represents the hemispheres of the brain. Finally, the layering of paints represent psychological evolution. Abreu’s artworks also act in a systemic way to entertain Systems psychology. Symbols in his work derive their meaning in relation to other symbols. The semantics in Abreu’s work, emulate the casual Omni-directionality of understanding psychological phenomenon theorized in Systems psychology .

Frank wakes up in a coma and returns to the Gallagher home unwelcomed; Ian and Caleb break up; Lip struggles with alcohol addiction, attempting to keep his drinking levels in moderation; Kevin, Veronica, and Svetlana continue their polyamorous relationship. With Sean gone, Fiona is promoted to manager at Patsy's Pies, which she successfully revamps to increase the diner's audience. When she discovers that a local laundromat building is for sale, Fiona buys the laundromat after speaking with the senile owner, Etta, who has Alzheimer's. With the help of Frank and Kevin, Fiona revamps the laundromat and lets Frank stay with Etta in her apartment. Though business at the revamped laundromat goes well, Fiona accepts an offer to sell the building for a major profit. Fiona subsequently sends Etta to live at a nursing home. Meanwhile, Carl breaks up with Dominique, but forms an unexpected bond with Dominique's stern cop father, who encourages Carl to enrol for military school. Inspired, Carl gets a scholarship and attends military school for the majority of the season. Lip begins a relationship with Sierra, a single mother whom Fiona hires as a waitress at Patsy's; Sierra has raised her young son alone, because her ex-boyfriend is an addict. Debbie gets engaged to Sierra's handicapped brother, Neil, in order to provide Franny with a home life. When Youens orchestrates an appeal for Lip at his college, Sierra encourages Lip to attend. However, the committee refuses to expunge Lip's disciplinary record, and does not let him re-enrol. Angered, Lip goes through a downwards spiral where he begins drinking heavily and attacks Sierra's ex-boyfriend; Sierra breaks up with Lip, not wanting her son to deal with two addicts. At The Alibi Room, Svetlana manipulates Kevin and Veronica into giving her final ownership of the bar, forging the ownership papers as adoption papers. Veronica feels betrayed and confides in Fiona.

Ian withdraws all of his money at the bank and accompanies Mickey (who is in a disguise) to the border. However, Ian gets second thoughts while at the border and refuses to flee. Upset, Mickey shares one last kiss with Ian before crossing the border alone. Ian later apologizes to Trevor for cheating on him. The second half of the season focuses on the brief reappearance of Monica, who has returned to Chicago with declining health. Monica tries to make amends with Fiona, Lip, Ian, and Debbie, but they are all generally dismissive of her. Monica also reunites with Frank, and the two resort back to their old habits, to the family's dismay. Monica reveals that she has irreparable brain damage, with her health on the line. In the penultimate episode, Frank and Monica begin plans to renew their vows, but Monica passes away from a brain aneurysm the next morning. After the news of Monica's death, Fiona prepares a small funeral for Monica, which is being payed for by Monica's father. At the funeral home, Fiona curses her mother for her troubles. Carl returns to Chicago to attend the funeral, where Frank tearfully says his goodbyes to Monica.

Built in 1829, it is one of the state's best-preserved stone pounds. It is located on the south side of Gardiner Road (Maine State Route 126), about west of its junction with Maine State Route 213. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. Description and history The Jefferson Cattle Pound is located in central northern Jefferson, a rural community in northern Lincoln County. It stands on the south side of Gardiner Road in a rural wooded area. It is a circular fieldstone structure about in diameter, with walls about high. The inside face of the wall is nearly vertical, while the outside is angled, giving the wall a thickness at its base of about and about at its top. Facing the road is an opening about wide, formed by roughly squared granite blocks. The opening is topped at a height of about by a shaped granite lintel that is about long and thick. There are three iron bolts mounted in the stones on the west side, which originally would have held a sturdy wooden gate. Remnants of lower walls extend from the opening toward the road, at a widening angle. These were historically joined to a stone wall that lined the roadway. The pound was built for the town by Silas Noyes, a local resident, in 1828 at a cost of $28. Prior to its construction, the town's pound keepers (of which there were seven at one time) had kept stray animals on their own properties. The pound remained in use until about 1888, when the town office of pound keeper was discontinued. Changes in the demographics of farm animals, and the increasing use of barbed wire to limit movements of animals led to a decline in the need for such a public facility. At the time of its listing on the National Register in 2004, it was one of the best- preserved of 21 surviving animal pounds in the state.

On 11 May 2016, the Director of the Civil Registry of Sonora announced that same-sex couples could begin marrying in the state without the need for an amparo (ie: court order). However, on 18 May 2016, the Governor ordered all civil registries in the state to stop marrying same-sex couples. History =Injunctions= An important recognition case was filed in 2013. A male same-sex couple, who had married in Mexico City in July 2012, returned to Sonora and attempted to enroll as a couple in the Social Security program, the Institute for Social Security and Services for State Workers of Sonora. They were denied admittance on 8 October 2012 and filed for an amparo (injunction) with a court in Culiacán, Sinaloa. On 9 October 2013, the court granted the injunction holding that the human right to form a family without discrimination had been violated. In early May 2014, a female couple from the municipality of San Luis Río Colorado were denied a marriage license by the Civil Registry. On 26 May 2014, they filed an injunction in the Fifth District Court of the Fifteenth Circuit in Mexicali, Baja California. A hearing was held on 17 September 2014. The couple received a favorable ruling on 22 October 2014.Juez da “luz verde” a primer boda gay Their wedding was scheduled to take place at the Civil Registry of Luis B.

They were rejected and subsequently filed an injunction.Surge nuevo caso de matrimonio “gay” The injunction was granted in February 2015. On 1 May 2015, six couples filed injunctions after being denied marriage licenses from the Civil Registry in Hermosillo.Impulsan seis parejas gay en Hermosillo amparos federales para casarse por el civil By 1 September 2016, 26 same-sex couples (20 of whom were lesbian couples and the remaining 6 were gay male couples) had sought injunctions to marry in Sonora. All of them had been granted by the courts. =Legislative action= An initiative to allow same- sex couples to marry was delivered to the state's Congress by former Labor Party candidate for governor, Miguel Angel Haro Moren, in January 2010. The proposal was rejected in February 2010 and the state filed a constitutional challenge against imposing laws of the Civil Code of the Federal District, concerning same-sex marriage, upon Sonora. In September 2017, all political parties in the state agreed to begin analyzing a proposed same-sex marriage bill. The bill's main sponsor said he was hopeful it would be accepted. Festeja PRD que se analice el matrimonio igualitario =Decision of the Director of the Civil Registry= On 11 May 2016, the Director of the Civil Registry of the State of Sonora, Martha Julissa Bojórquez Castillo, announced that same-sex couples could begin marrying in the state without the need for an amparo (i.e. court order). More than 12 court orders had been granted to same-sex couples in Sonora prior to the decision, more than the 5 necessary to make the state's offending provisions in the Civil Code null and inoperable. Almost immediately after the aforementioned decision, the civil registrar of the municipality of Navojoa announced that same-sex couples would still have to be granted an injunction to be able to marry in the municipality. He argued that because the Congress of Sonora had not yet changed the law, an amparo was still necessary. Following Bojórquez Castillo's decision, members of Congress from across the political spectrum announced their support for amending the Family Code to define marriage as being between two people, including deputies from the National Action Party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party and the Party of the Democratic Revolution. On 18 May 2016, Governor Claudia Pavlovich Arellano ordered all civil registries in the state to stop marrying same-sex couples. She argued that the Civil Code of Sonora prohibits same-sex marriages and that the state would continue to follow those laws (even though the articles in the Civil Code that are denying marriage rights to same-sex couples have already been declared inoperable and unconstitutional). She added that civil registries may still marry same-sex couples only if they are granted an injunction beforehand. Marriage statistics While same-sex marriage is currently not legal in Sonora, marriages have been allowed to proceed in individual cases, via injunctions.

Founded in 2009 by a professed Franciscan, it is a brotherhood of Catholic laymen consecrated to living the Gospel according to their Constitutions and the Rule of 1221 of the Brothers and Sisters of Penance.  Origins  The FFV is an autonomous outgrowth of the Franciscan family, composed of regular and extern brothers who form one family, as did the first generation Franciscans, who gathered around Saint Francis to follow the Gospel according to the Rule of Penance. The fraternity combines the monastic life with itinerant preaching of penance and conversion, in obedience and submission to the authentic and timeless Magisterium of the Roman Catholic Church, subject to the Roman Pontiff, always under the guidance and authority of the local Ordinary. = Regular Brothers = The term “regular”, from the Latin regula, \\"rule\\", identifies brothers of common life who are celibate and live the consecrated life in community. The regular brothers live in a community house, under the guidance of a superior known as guardian. The ideal number of brothers is three per community house, not to exceed five, in order to preserve the spirit of fraternity. They are to own nothing. They rent their home, share their material resources, and work to provide for their material needs as prescribed by Saint Francis in his Testament. When the income is not enough, the brothers beg. At the current stage of canonical development, the brothers have permission from the ordinary to profess private vows. They profess the Evangelical Counsels and a fourth vow to proclaim the Gospel of life to the voiceless. Upon entering novitiate they receive a new name. The Constitutions make provision for regular brothers who are called to live as hermits according to the Franciscan tradition. = Extern Brothers = The extern brothers \\"live in the secular world, but are not of the world\\". They are husbands, fathers, and single men wishing to marry. They are full members of the fraternity. They come together with each other and the regular brothers at the weekly family meeting, liturgical functions, prayer, and apostolic activities. The extern brothers do not profess vows, but solemnly promise to live according to the Rule of Penance and the Constitutions for one year at a time.  Way of Life  The Franciscans of Life strive to proclaim the Gospel of life in an intense life of prayer, penance, and poverty, and to atone for those who embrace the culture of death. The brothers freely serve the voiceless, paying special attention to the preborn child and his family, the chronically and terminally ill and their families and caregivers, and the immigrant poor. They propose to do whatever is in their power to work with the Catholic Church to proclaim the Gospel of life and to protect the inalienable right to life of every human being. In keeping with Franciscan tradition, the fraternity is governed by an elected Superior General who is the servant of all, and to whom the brothers owe loving obedience, respect, and attention as a legitimate successor of St. Francis and as the voice of Christ. Through his example and effort he leads his brothers in the observance of the Rule, Constitutions, and Modus Procedendi, stimulating continuity in the Catholic and Franciscan tradition. The founder of the community is the current superior general, with the motto \\"Deus eligit stultus\\" (\\"God chooses the foolish\\"). The community chapter is the highest authority to which all the brothers must give submission with good will and trust, including the superior general. = Rule = The Rule of 1221 is the foundation Rule of the Brothers and Sisters of Penance. Its tenets were the basis of many medieval penitential groups and the life-path of many saints and blessed. It is in no way incompatible with any human culture or historical situation. Penance is a special characteristic of the Seraphic Father and the legacy that he left to his sons and daughters. The Rule guides the practice of outward and inward acts of penance for the benefit of the brothers and for those who do not do penance. Embraced out of love and with joy, penance is practiced discretely so as not to call unnecessary attention to self and not to make others feel uncomfortable. = Constitutions = The Constitutions pave the community's living of the Rule of St. Francis in accordance with the foundational charism of the community and the needs of the local Church. They received the blessing of the local ordinary. The brothers are to observe them faithfully. Rooted in the Capuchin tradition, the Constitutions \\"look back in order to move forward\\", including elements such as the Roman Franciscan Breviary in English and Latin, a monthly Day of Prayer, a weekly chapter of faults, the keeping of an individual Culpa notebook, the application of the Discipline, the grand silence after Compline, the sharing of a small dormitory called cella which is reserved to the brothers and is a place of silence, and the total consecration to the Immaculate. The fraternity is a lay community. Clerics may be admitted with the consent of their ordinary, their number never to exceed ten percent to preserve the lay character of the community. Separate chapters are provided for the extern brothers suitable to their state of life. By reason of the same vocation the brothers are equal, whether regular or extern, lay or cleric, and regardless of academic achievement. No brother may go by titles such as “Father, Doctor, Master, Professor, Engineer, or Don”, but all are called \\"brother\\" without distinction. = Modus Procedendi = Details on the ways in which the regular brothers are to carry out their daily lives are delineated in the Modus Procedendi, from the Latin \\"manner of proceeding\\". A short handbook rooted in the Capuchin traditions, it is a guide to practices, customs and regulations that are not part of the original Rule and Constitutions. The Modus Procedendi can only be interpreted by the superior general. The external behaviors delineated are rooted in charity towards God and neighbor, aim at avoiding singularization and establishing structure, and ultimately help the brothers acquire internal virtues needed to mirror the perfection of the Gospel. = Admission = Membership to the Franciscans of Life is limited to Catholic males age 18 and older who are in full communion with the Catholic Church and with the local ordinary, and who firmly submit to the authentic Magisterium of the Church, holding firmly to the one true Faith. No married man may be admitted as an extern brother without the written consent of his wife. Clerics may be admitted with the consent of their ordinary. Formation includes the stages of aspirancy (up to six months), postulancy (up to 12 months), and novitiate (one year). The regular brothers make temporary profession for three years, then perpetual profession. The extern brothers bind themselves annually through a promise to follow the Rule and Constitutions. = Vows = At the current stage of canonical development, the brothers have permission from the ordinary to profess private vows. The regular brothers profess the Evangelical Counsels of obedience, poverty, and celibate chastity. They also profess a fourth vow to freely proclaim the Gospel of life to the voiceless. The extern brothers bind themselves through an annual promise to observe the spirit of the Evangelical Counsels in accordance with their state of life. The Constitutions provide separate chapters to guide them in this endeavor.  Ministry  The Franciscans of Life are involved in pro-life education, street evangelization, days of recollection, pilgrimages, spiritual direction, religious education, and other ministries with a focus on the sanctity of life. = Preborn Child = The foundational charism of the Franciscans of Life includes ministering to the preborn child and his family. The brothers pay special attention to fathers, by supporting and creating programs and services for them.  Project Joseph  In joint venture with Respect Life Ministry Archdiocese of Miami, the founder of the Franciscans of Life created \\"Project Joseph\\", a Franciscan outreach ministry for fathers in at-risk pregnancies. The program, first of its kind in the nation, offers individual counseling, group education, and material assistance to fathers. \\"Project Joseph\\" also shows that the services of the Pregnancy Help Centers are not just for the women, but also for their partners, dispelling the mindset according to which pregnancy is a mother's issue. The program welcomes fathers from the moment of conception until the child is one year old and it does not discriminate based on religion or marital status. Project Joseph mentors are particularly welcoming of dads who think that they will be in the way and feel that they do not know what to do with the new baby, because of inexperience, difficult life situations, and many other reasons. The outcome of the program often goes beyond developing paternity skills. Dads who had dropped out of school, had legal trouble, and even experienced homelessness, spoke of how their lives changed after attending Project Joseph. Several clients have manifested an interest in becoming Project Joseph mentors after completing the program. The program consists of three, six-week-long series of classes focusing on what it means to be a father, fetal development, and wise use of time and money, as well as communication skills. Given the Franciscan spirituality of the program, mentors receive initial and ongoing formation from the Franciscans of Life. Founded in 2009, Project Joseph has evolved into an archdiocesan network of formation and service for men who are in crisis pregnancies, present in all of the Archdiocesan Pregnancy Help Centers. In January 2014 it was extensively featured in the Florida Catholic. In June 2015 the Institute on Religious Life published an article featuring the ministry of the Franciscans of Life in Project Joseph. In October 2014 Project Joseph was assigned its first administrative office, inaugurated in January 2016. In November 2015 the director of Project Joseph spoke at the first Hispanic Respect Life Conference in the Archdiocese of Miami, emphasizing the role model of the project patrons, Saint Joseph, and Saint Maximilian Kolbe, a Franciscan who, while prisoner in Auschwitz, offered his life to save a husband and a father. Catholic organizations from other states and from abroad have reached out to Respect Life Ministry Archdiocese of Miami to start Project Joseph in their dioceses. Project Joseph and Franciscans of Life were featured on several national Catholic media in August and September 2016, including Catholic News Service.  University  The Franciscans of Life supported the collaboration between the new South Dade Pregnancy Help Center and the Catholic Campus Ministry of Florida International University. In November 2015, they helped organize a groundbreaking university-wide panel presentation titled \\"The Right to Be Born\\", on the inviolability of human life, how crisis pregnancies affect men and women, and what the FIU community can do to help. The event was not religious or political, and featured local community leaders along with FIU alumni, students, and staff members. The topics included a medical and philosophical overview of human life from conception to natural death, post-abortion fatherhood, the journey from grief to healing, including men in crisis pregnancies, journey from pro-choice to pro-life, and the work carried out by local Pregnancy Help Centers. The event was extensively featured by FIU Student Media and by the FIU newspaper The Beacon. In Fall 2016, \\"Panthers for Life\\", the FIU student chapter of Students for Life, was established at FIU in collaboration with FIU Campus Ministry. = Immigrant Poor = The Franciscans of Life serve the immigrant poor regardless of their status, reaching out to individuals in need or welcoming their request for assistance. If they cannot alleviate their poverty, they try to alleviate their loneliness and fear, and help them meet their spiritual needs. In 2015 the fraternity published an online Spanish directory of services for immigrants and refugees in Miami-Dade and Broward. The directory lists resources such as health, public services, public transit, internet access, legal aid, prison ministry, food and clothing, pregnancy help, aid for minors, housing and shelters, and education. In just a few months accesses to the directory rose to hundreds of monthly visits. = Elderly and Sick = The sick and the elderly have a special place in the way of life of the FFV. The brothers minister to them and provide education to their family members and healthcare providers. While the brothers may not administer a healthcare facility, they work for the creation of education programs on end of life issues that proclaim the moral law. Brothers who are nurses work in nursing homes and hospices, taking particular care of the dying. Others meet the spiritual needs of the sick by volunteering through nearby parishes to bring them Holy Communion. = Other Activities = The writings of the Franciscans of Life have been featured locally and abroad. A book on the Gospel of Life from the Franciscan perspective is in progress. The brothers have also been guests at Radio Paz and EWTN Radio programs. The community was featured in August 2016 in an article on the Florida Catholic. While the regular brothers are only allowed to use technology for education, the apostolate, and care of the sick brothers, the community itself has several social media outlets, including a community blog, a YouTube page, and a Facebook group. In 2012 the Franciscans of Life supported the Second General Synod of the Archdiocese of Miami participating in the Adult Faith Formation focus team. The team is part of the area of conversion, education, and formation.  Status  = Canonical Status = Founded in 2009 in the territory of the Archdiocese of Miami, the Franciscans of Life are a private association of Catholic men with the support and blessing of the local ordinary to recruit members, establish a formation program, open houses of formation, profess private vows, and freely exercise their ministry in the territory of the Archdiocese. The fraternity is to serve in a special way the unborn children, the chronically and terminally ill, and the immigrant who is poor and feels hopeless. In 2017 the Franciscans of Life were listed in Georgetown University's \\"Directory of Emerging U.S. Communities of Consecrated Life Since Vatican II\\".  Franciscan Succession  The Franciscans of Life is an outgrowth from the Franciscan family, founded by a canonically professed (OFS) Franciscan and former Capuchin friar. Every branch of the Franciscan family is legally autonomous, but all are related through the same spiritual father, St. Francis of Assisi and the observance of one of his four Rules. The Franciscans of Life seek to maintain a fraternal and cooperative relationship with other Franciscans. = Civil Status = The Franciscans of Life is separately incorporated as a nonprofit corporation under the law of Florida, and so has a separate civil legal existence from the Archdiocese. Franciscans of Life is tax-exempt under IRC section 501(a) and described in section 501(c)(3) as a public charity.

This is a combination of the B-1 visa (for short-term business trips) and the B-2 visa (for short-term tourism/pleasure trips). People on B visas are generally not allowed to engage in productive work or study activities. However, in some cases, B visas can be issued that allow people to engage in some types of productive work and learning activity, in lieu of another visa. The three visa categories, for which a B visa could be issued instead, are the H-1B visa (the primary use case: a temporary visa for skilled workers), H-3 visa (a trainee and special education exchange visitor visa), and J-1 visa (a visa for exchange visitor students and scholars). The U.S. Department of State recommends that consular officers clearly annotate such B visas to make the scope of the visa clear to the applicant and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection officer at the port of entry. Prior to the September 2001 attacks, the B visa could also be used by people on short courses of study, but now such people need to get a M-1 visa or F-1 visa. However, B visas may still have annotations that allow for transition to student visas through Form I-539. Not all United States consulates offer B visas in lieu of other visas. The total number of such visas issued is also small: for instance, in 2011, the U.S. Department of State reported that fewer than 1000 B-1 in lieu of H-1B visas were issued annually. Some consulates, such as the Chennai consulate, explicitly listed the B-1 in lieu of H-1B as part of the Business Executive Program until that program was discontinued on April 1, 2015. Some consulates, such as the Mumbai consulate, list the B-1 in lieu of H-1B but not as part of any specific program. This article discusses these rare uses of the B visa and the rules governing these uses.  Rules governing the B visa, and the limited way these rules are modified  = Inflexible rules = The following rules governing the B visa need to be honored even for B visas issued in lieu of other visas: * The person must not receive compensation from a United States source; however, provision of accommodation or reimbursement of expenses incidental to a temporary stay are allowed. * The person's stay must be temporary, both per visit and in terms of the total duration of stay (in case of a multi-entry visa). * The person should still enter without immigrant intent or the intent to convert the stay to a long-term stay; for instance, the person should not look for employment in the U.S. job market. = Restrictions on usual B visas that get relaxed = People on usual B visas are allowed to engage in the following activities: # Engaging in commercial transactions, which do not involve gainful employment in the United States (such as a merchant taking orders for goods manufactured abroad) # Negotiating contracts # Consulting with business associates # Litigating a court case # Participating in scientific educational, professional, or business conventions, conferences, or seminars # Undertaking independent research B visas issued in lieu of work or trainee visas add to this list of permissible activities the activity of productive work or learning activity in the specific context permitted by the visa. For instance, a B visa issued in lieu of a H-1B for a worker for a non-U.S. company working on a project for a U.S. client allows the worker to engage in productive work activity as part of completion of the project. Generally, a B visa issued in lieu of any other visa category is strictly more powerful than an ordinary B visa. In particular, all activities permitted under an ordinary B visa are permitted for a B visa in lieu of another visa. In particular, a B visa in lieu of another visa can be used for ordinary business or travel purposes as long as the visa is valid. = Differences in the application criteria and process = For a typical work or exchange visitor visa, there are additional prior steps that need to be taken before the visa application: * For all employer- sponsored nonimmigrant work or trainee visas (in particular, the H-1B visa and H-3 visa), Form I-129 (Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker) needs to be filed with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. * For the H-1B visa, a Labor Condition Application needs to be filed with and approved by the U.S. Department of Labor prior to filing Form I-129. * The J-1 visa requires a Form DS-2019 to be issued by an appropriate Student and Exchange Visitor Program-certified institution. Neither of these steps is part of the application process for a B visa in lieu of a work visa. Rather, the application is made directly to the consulate with all the relevant evidence submitted to the consulate. The following are five criteria that need to be satisfied by work visa applicants and their petitioning employers: # The sponsoring entity (which is the employer in the case of work visas) is a United States entity. # (In the case of the H-1B) the employee's wages and working conditions are at or above that of other employees in the company, and hiring the employee will not adversely affect other employees (the precise nature of attestations that need to be made varies based on the visa category and the type of employer). # (In the case of the H-1B) the employee will be paid at or above the prevailing wage for that job and intended employment area (this is part of the Labor Condition Application for the H-1B status). # The employee is adequately qualified for skilled work. The standard of qualification and the nature of evidence needed varies based on the type of work visa. # There is a clear employer-employee relationship. In particular, self-petitions are (generally) not accepted. The in lieu of visas differ in the following respects: * Criterion (1) gets flipped around: the applicant now needs to demonstrate that the employer is a non-U.S. employer (note that B-1 in lieu of J-1 is a little different; see the section for more). In the case of an employer with no United States presence, this is easy. For multinationals, it is important to show that the applicant is employed and paid by the non-U.S. part of the company. * Criterion (2) is no longer applicable, because the employer, being a non-U.S. employer, has no U.S. workforce. * Criteria (3), (4), and (5) continue to be required. In particular, criterion (5) means that self-employed people cannot generally use this category. = Importance of having the \\"in lieu of\\" annotation at the time of visa issuance = An ordinary B visa cannot be retroactively changed by an applicant or his or her sponsoring company or institution to a B visa in lieu of another visa. Even if a person has an already valid B visa, the person must get a new B visa in lieu of the appropriate visa in order to visit the United States for productive work or study activities. When the person gets this visa, the earlier B visa is cancelled (without prejudice, i.e., in a way that indicates that this was not due to any fault or violation on the part of the applicant) and replaced by the new B visa. = Inapplicability to VWP travel = Most citizens of Visa Waiver Program (VWP) countries are eligible for visa-free travel to the United States for short-term business and tourist trips of the sort that would usually require B visas. However, people entering via the VWP, without a visa, cannot engage in the additional activities permitted for the in lieu of visas. In other words, the VWP mostly substitutes for ordinary B visas, but cannot substitute for B visas in lieu of other visas. = No change of status possible within the United States = Stay on the usual B visa can be extended while in the United States by filing Form I-539 with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. Form I-539 cannot be used to change the nature of the B visa to include the \\"in lieu of\\" annotation; such changes can only be made at a consulate. = No dependent visa = As with ordinary B visas, there is no visa for dependents of the in lieu of visas. However, the family members of B visa holders can still apply for ordinary B visas and use those to accompany or visit the holder of the in lieu of visa.  History  = Original use of B-1 in lieu of H-1 = The use of the B visa in lieu of other visas is not mentioned in any legislative statutes. The concept appears to have been first created in the 1960s in a joint effort of the Immigration and Naturalization Services (the predecessor to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, that carried out all the immigration processing and enforcement functions currently carried out by the branches of the DHS) and the U.S. Department of State. The first explicit articulation of the \\"B-1 In Lieu of H-1\\" category was in a 1982 cable. As of 1982, there was no separate H-1B visa; rather there was a single H-1 category for high-skilled workers (the H-1B in its present form would be created as a result of the Immigration Act of 1990). The cable was in response to Matter of Srinivasan, a case involving the denial of B-1 status to employees of an India-based computer company. The INS determined that the B-1 classification (in lieu of H-1) is appropriate under the following circumstances: # The alien receives no remuneration from a U.S. source # The alien is a bona fide nonimmigrant # The alien qualifies for H-1 status and will perform duties that \\"require distinguished merit and ability\\" # The services to be provided are necessary to the integrated international production, marketing, and service system of the corporation, its subsidiaries, and affiliates, and so [does] not involve the reassignment of an alien to an employer in the United States. = Changes in the 1990s = The Immigration Act of 1990 officially split the original H-1 visa into a H-1A visa (for nurses) and H-1B visa (for other categories of skilled workers) and imposed an annual numerical cap on H-1Bs. In 1993, the INS and the U.S. Department of State proposed regulations that, by explicitly listing all permissible uses of B-1 visas, would have eliminated the B-1 in lieu of H-1 category. However, these regulations were never implemented. = Tightening of restrictions on B visa use for study = After the September 11, 2001 attacks, people were no longer permitted to engage in even short courses of study on the B visa. Instead, such people needed to get a M-1 visa or F-1 visa. However, B visas may still have annotations that allow for transition to student status through Form I-539. However, there is also a H-3 visa, which can be used by trainees (people who have been invited to participate in a training program) and special education exchange visitors. It is possible to receive a B-1 in lieu of H-3. It is also possible to receive a B-1 in lieu of a J-1 visa, but this applies only when the sponsoring entity is the United States government. = Renewed scrutiny in the 2010s = In the aftermath of revelations by whistleblower Palmer about apparently fraudulent immigration practices by multinational company Infosys, there was renewed scrutiny of the B-1 visa. Infosys paid a $34 million settlement to the United States government. Senator Chuck Grassley raised concerns about the use of B-1 in lieu of H-1B, in particular highlighting the lack of protections for United States labor because, unlike H-1B visas, no Labor Condition Application was needed. In response, Cyrus Mehta and Myriam Jaidi, writing for Immigration Daily, noted that there were many work visa categories, such as the L-1 visa and O-1 visa, that did not require a LCA, and the B-1 in lieu of H-1B was not unique in this regard. Immigration lawyer Angelo Paparelli stressed the importance of not jeopardizing the B visa. The U.S. Department of State's response to Grassley's questions led some commentators to believe that the B-1 in lieu of visas were in imminent danger. However, a cable issued by the Department of State in June 2012, with updated guidelines on the use of B-1 in lieu of H-1B and H-3, suggested that the category would still continue to be used.  B-1 in lieu of H-1B  The most common B in lieu of visa is the B-1 issued in lieu of the H-1B visa. To better understand the role of this visa, we review the main use case of the H-1B visa. = The process to obtain an H-1B visa and the scope of the visa = The H-1B status is a temporary nonimmigrant worker status working for a United States employer granted for up to three years (extendable by another three years, after which it can be extended only in case of pending Form I-140 or Adjustment of Status applications). The procedure for obtaining the status is as follows: * The United States employer files a Labor Condition Application for the worker with the United States Department of Labor, making various attestations related to wages, working conditions, effect on currently employed workers, strikes and lockouts, and notice. If the employer is a H-1B-dependent employer or a willful violator and the worker is not exempt based on compensation or educational qualifications, additional attestations related to displacement of United States workers are needed. * The United States employer files a Form I-129 H-1B petition for the nonimmigrant worker with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. The petition includes the LCA as well as proof that the worker is skilled in ways that are needed on the job. The first H-1B petition for a worker not made by a nonprofit research institution is subject to the annual H-1B cap (65,000 general + 20,000 for master's degree holders) that is applied every fiscal year. Since Form I-129 can be submitted at most six months in advance, petitions with a start date of October 1 (the first date of the fiscal year) are generally submitted in the beginning of April, and the annual caps are usually met within the first week of April. * Once the H-1B petition is approved, the worker may start working at the indicated start date of employment with the employer. If the worker is outside the United States prior the start date of employment, the worker needs to obtain a H-1B visa at a United States consulate. The consulate looks at the LCA, Form I-129, employment letter and other pieces of evidence and in addition vets the application based on the standard criteria for allocating a visa (strong home country ties, no grounds of inadmissibility). The worker can use the H-1B visa to enter the country at most ten days before the start date, and receives a Form I-94 from U.S. Customs and Border Protection's Office of Field Operations officer for the duration of the H-1B. In particular, the following aspects of the H-1B make it unsuitable for various kinds of temporary work: * For first-time cap-subject workers, petitions can de facto be submitted only in the first week of April and for jobs starting in October. This makes it difficult for short-term work that is needed suddenly. * For first-time cap-subject workers, unless the worker has a master's degree, making it through the cap is a matter of luck. * The process requires the filing of the LCA and Form I-129. Both of these have bureaucratic, legal, and administrative overhead. The latter in particular costs both time and money. * The employer sponsoring the worker must be a United States entity. It therefore cannot be used by non-U.S. employers who seek to send workers to the United States to work with a client. Rather, the client would have to sponsor the worker as an employee. = What the B-1 in lieu of H-1B does = For multinational companies that have both United States and international offices, or for non-U.S. companies with U.S. clients, the B-1 in lieu of H-1B is a viable option. The B-1 in lieu of H-1B differs from the H-1B in the following respects: * No Labor Condition Application needs to be filed. In particular, no attestations need to be made regarding wages and working conditions, or (in the case of H-1B-dependent employers) displacement of US workers. * No Form I-129 needs to be filed. Thus, the cost, bureaucratic overhead, and time of the form are saved on. * The duration and terms of the visa match those of a B visa rather than a H-1B visa. However, the B-1 in lieu of H-1B does require the worker to demonstrate that he or she is skilled and that the skills are needed for the job being performed in the United States. The worker must also show that the wage being paid to the worker is at or above the prevailing wage for that occupation and intended employment area. A clear employer-employee relationship must be established, and in the case of multinationals, it must be clearly demonstrated that the worker is employed and paid by the non-U.S. part of the company. These demonstrations need to be made directly to the consulate rather than having to first go through USCIS. All the other usual requirements needed to obtain a nonimmigrant visa continue to apply, namely strong home times (to overcome the Section 214(b) ground of denial) and not satisfying any of the grounds of inadmissibility. = Advantages of the B-1 in lieu of H-1B = There are a few key reasons why employers might use the B-1 in lieu of H-1B: * For non-U.S. companies with U.S. clients, this category may make more sense than the H-1B, since the worker will continue to be employed by the non-U.S. employer. In fact, using a regular H-1B may not even be feasible if the company has no U.S. presence. * The total time taken, from the decision to apply to the time the worker can start work, is much shorter than the 6 months taken for a H-1B position. In particular, it may be more suitable for work that needs to be urgently done. Moreover, the B-1 is not subject to the annual H-1B cycle and the lottery. * The total cost of application generally comes out to be lower. = Disadvantages of the B-1 in lieu of H-1B = The following have been cited as disadvantages of the B-1 in lieu of H-1B: * It is available only at some consulates. * Purely U.S.-based companies cannot use this category, and multinationals with significant U.S. presence may have trouble obtaining it, since they need to show that the worker is employed by the non-U.S. part of the company. * The maximum duration of stay matches that of a B visa, and in particular cannot be used for long-term employment.  B-1 in lieu of H-3  = Summary = The H-3 visa is a temporary visa for trainees and special education exchange visitors. It has two subcategories: * The H-3 trainee visa: This is for trainees being sponsored by a United States entity to receive training not available in the trainee's home country. No productive work activity is allowed on this visa. * The H-3 special education exchange visitor visa: This is to participate in a special education exchange visitor training program for children with physical, mental, or emotional disabilities. There is a cap of 50 visas per year, and only one was approved in 2012. A B-1 visa can be issued in lieu of the H-3 trainee visa. In both cases (the H-3 trainee visa and the B-1 in lieu of H-3), both these conditions must be satisfied: * No productive work activity is allowed while on the visa except on-the-job training explicitly specified as part of the program. * The training must not be available in the applicant's home country. The key differences between the H-3 and the B-1 in lieu of H3 are: * The H-3 can be issued only when the sponsoring entity is a United States entity. The B-1 in lieu of H-3 can be issued only when the sponsoring entity is a non-U.S. entity. * The sponsoring entity must file Form I-129 with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services and receive an approval notice prior to a H-3 visa application. However, for the B-1 in lieu of H-3, an application can be made directly to the United States consulate, and Form I-129 is not relevant. * The B-1 in lieu of H-3 has the same time limits on stay as usual B-1 visas, which is a maximum of 6 months per year, and therefore a maximum of 6 contiguous months. It may therefore not be usable for people on training programs of a longer duration. = Advantages of the B-1 in lieu of H-3 = * For non-U.S. companies, this category may make more sense and may in fact be the only feasible category to use. * Since there is no intermediate step involving Form I-129, the total time taken to obtain the visa is shorter. = Disadvantages of the B-1 in lieu of H-3 = * It is available only at some consulates. * Purely U.S.-based companies cannot use this category, and multinationals with significant U.S. presence may have trouble obtaining it, since they need to demonstrate that the trainee is under the non-U.S. part of the company. * The maximum duration of stay matches that of a B visa, and in particular cannot be used for training programs longer than six months.  B-1 in lieu of J-1  The J-1 visa is a special visa for exchange visitors (students or scholars) sponsored by a university, private sector, or government program. The B-1 in lieu of J-1 is used if all the conditions below are satisfied, as clarified in a 2004 memo issued by the U.S. Department of State: * The sponsoring entity is part of the government of the United States (usually, a U.S mission abroad). * The purpose of the visit does not fall under an already approved exchange visitor program. Generally, a letter stating this from the sponsoring entity within the United States government is required.

Work was slow and funds insufficient. The new church was erected in 1810, although it soon required restructuring, and it was feared that the dome would collapse. In 1863, a consultation with the provincial architect Don Jose Maria Prado; but by 1864, there was a partial collapse of the nave roof. The bell-tower was erected at this time. Repairs continued until 1895. After Spanish civil war, the 19th-century tower was demolished.

Anaïs called her husband Fernando because he did not like the name Fernandez. The business was named \\"Anais i Fernando\\", later renamed \\"\\". They specialized in portraits. The new business name was from Anaïs Napoleón's last name and not her husband's which was Soriano.

An active filmmaker since 2007, Pablos has been involved in six feature films, including shorts and documentaries. Pablos attained recognition for directing La Vida Después (2013) and Las Elegidas (2015). Pablos has worked with non- professional actors on his narrative films, for which he has received awards at several international film festivals, including the Morelia International Film Festival and Cannes Film Festival. Pablos received an Ariel Award for Best Short Fiction Film in 2010 for La Canción de los Niños Muertos and in 2016, won for Best Director and Best Original Screenplay at the 58th Ariel Awards in Mexico for his work in the film Las Elegidas. Early life and background Pablos was born in Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico and studied filmmaking at the Centro de Capacitación Cinematográfica (CCC) in Mexico City. Pablos also received a scholarship granted by the National Fund for Culture and Arts (FONCA) to specialize in screenwriting. Film career Pablos earned his academic degree from the CCC with the short film La Canción de los Niños Muertos in 2008. The film about five teenagers who lose their mother, starring Sebastián Aguirre and Rodrigo Azuela, won for Best Fiction Short Film at the Morelia International Film Festival and was screened during the International Critics' Week of the 2009 Cannes Film Festival. For this work, Pablos earned the Ariel Award for Best Live Action Short and also the SIGNIS Award during the 4th International Short Film Festival (FICMEX), being the SIGNIS jury's verdict that \\"the film narrative takes us into the complexity of disparate feelings as violence and tenderness, anger and forgiveness, rebellion and reconciliation.\\" After directing the documentaries La Escritura en la Pared and Una Frontera, Todas las Fronteras (2010), Pablos premiered in 2013 his first feature film, La Vida Después, also starring Azuela, Américo Hollander and María Renée Prudencio. The film, about two brothers searching for their stranged mother, received the Klic Award granted by the Mexican movie theater chain Cinépolis during the Morelia Film Festival. La Vida Después was the only Mexican film screened during the 70th Venice International Film Festival and according to Pablos is about \\"living in the same roof with a complete stranger, although that is your family... it has to do with the lack of communication\\". About the thematic similarities between his first short film and his first feature film, Pablos stated to magazine Encuadres: > \\"I knew that I was interested in keep talking about family, namely, about > brotherhood, but in the process I discovered what was the true essence of > this film [La Vida Después], which is about family heritage emotionally more > than physically and how your children refuse to follow the footsteps of > their parents because often there is a kind of chain that is impossible to > break and this generates feelings of frustration and rejection. My question > was whether the chain can be broken or not, and what the consequences are > and what involves the separation of the family that [\\"the mother\\"] loves.\\" > —David Pablos Pablos directed 20 y Más por el Arte, a TV series created to celebrate Canal 22's 20th Anniversary in 2013. The series followed 20 FONCA beneficiaries through their daily life and creative processes. In 2014, the film Las Tinieblas, co-written by Pablos and director Daniel Castro Zimbrón, was shown included on the Cinéfondation official selection during the 2014 Cannes Film Festival. Later that year, after an exhaustive casting process, Pablos filmed Las Elegidas in Tijuana with non-professional actors. The film was originally based on a book written by Mexican novelist Jorge Volpi from which Pablos developed a screenplay that features a love story that evolves in a complaint about kidnapping, white slave traffic and prostitution, with a \\"documentary tone\\". Las Elegidas competed at the Un Certain Regard section of the 2015 Cannes Film Festival and later premiered at the Morelia International Film Festival. Sight & Sound magazine ranked the film at number 118 of their list for the Best Films of 2015. In 2016, Las Elegidas received 13 nominations for the 58th Ariel Awards and won five awards, including Best Picture, and Best Director and Best Original Screenplay for Pablos.

Inspired by singer Victoria Spivey's \\"Black Snake Blues\\", the song was released on Paramount Records in 1926, and has since become recognized as a signature composition which exemplifies Jefferson's unconventional melodic style and utilization of double entendres. The song was re-recorded a year later as \\"Black Snake Moan\\" for Okeh Records, and both versions have remained accessible through the availability of several compilation albums. Background During the 1920s, Paramount Records were in-demand for customers of genuine country blues recordings. Blind Lemon Jefferson had been performing across Texas and the Mississippi Delta since 1912 and garnered a considerable following. Jefferson was signed to Paramount in 1925 as a result of one of two proposed scenarios: pianist Sammy Price recommended him to the label or Paramount music director Arthur C. Laibly discovered Jefferson performing on Dallas streets. Regardless, a talent scout recorded demos with Jefferson and the singer traveled to Chicago to record his first official sides: a pair of gospel tunes under the pseudonym Deacon L. J. Bates. Sales were strong, prompting further sessions with Jefferson in 1926. In his third session for Paramount, Jefferson recorded \\"That Black Snake Moan\\", along with \\"Black Horse Blues\\", \\"Corina Blues\\", and \\"Jack O' Diamond Blues\\". Riddled with sexual nuances, lyrically \\"That Black Snake Moan\\" was explicit with its intentions, with lines such as \\"Mmm, black snake crawlin' in my room / And some pretty mama had better come and get this black snake soon\\". Record producer J. Mayo Williams recalled Jefferson was \\"just as cool and collected as any artist I've ever seen\\" as they carried out the session. Indeed, Jefferson's calm and collected persona coupled with high-pitched howls added to the song's sexual innuendo. Jefferson was inspired to compose the song after singer Victoria Spivey enjoyed success with \\"Black Snake Blues\\", a tune that Spivey insists was not intended to have the same sexual innuendo as Jefferson's \\"That Black Snake Moan\\". \\"That Black Snake Moan\\" was first released on Paramount in October 1926. Jefferson re-recorded another version of the song for Okeh Records, which was closely related to the original rendition, but also had superior sound quality. This version, titled simply \\"Black Snake Moan\\", was released in March 1927 along with another well-known Jefferson tune \\"Matchbox Blues\\". The composition has remained relatively accessible throughout the years, appearing on Jefferson compilation albums such as The Immortal Blind Lemon, Black Snake Moan, and King of the Blues.

Kobayashi has criticized the members of Nippon Kaigi, which include Prime Minister Shinzō Abe and two thirds of Abe's cabinet, as \\"hav[ing] trouble accepting the reality that Japan lost the war\\"; he asserts the groups wants to return Japan to the militaristic Meiji Constitution (1890–1947), which declares the Emperor of Japan a literal deity and which makes women subservient to men. Kobayashi also draws attention to the fact that many members of Nippon Kaigi are descendants of those responsible for Japan's role in the Pacific War. Kobayashi, who was inspired by U.S. Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, formed the party to reverse the policies of Prime Minister Shinzō Abe. The party's name is based on the anger of both Kobayashi and the Japanese people at Japanese politics, not only at the heavy-handedness of the ruling coalition (Liberal Democratic Party (Japan) and Komeitō, but also disappointment at the opposition (Democratic Party, Japanese Communist Party and others). The party policies will include scrapping the security laws passed by the Abe cabinet, halting revision of the Japanese Constitution, restoring freedom of speech, and reducing the dependency of nuclear power.

Their services include the Wellington-based BK117 Westpac Rescue Helicopter, as well as two nationwide J32 Jetstream air ambulance planes that transport patients who are critically ill and in need of hospital transfer for specialist care. The majority of patients are from the central or lower North Island, or the upper South Island of New Zealand. Equipment =Westpac Rescue Helicopter= The Westpac Rescue Helicopter is a BK117 emergency air rescue service which operates out of Wellington Hospital. It is used primarily for search and rescue but may also be used for police and bomb squad operations, or in firefighting. The helicopter often rescues car accident victims, injured trampers stranded in the bush, or performs rescues in other areas which are a considerable distance from any nearby hospital. Each rescue costs $2500 NZD, which is provided through donations from individuals and companies across New Zealand. =Air ambulance= Life Flight's J32 Jetstream air ambulance, ZK-LFW, replaced their older Metroliner plane in 2012. A second aircraft of the same type, ZK-LFT, was purchased in 2017 to meet rising demand. Both carry patients between hospitals around New Zealand to receive specialist medical care. The service flies an average of four emergency trips to hospitals around New Zealand per day. ZK-LFW has custom paintwork (bandages) designed by Weta Workshop. Pilot Ian Pirie commented that flying patients by air presents unique challenges, such as ensuring soft landings for patients with spinal injuries, or flying very low with patients with brain or diving injuries. He commented that calls involving premature babies were often the most rewarding, as he was often able to see how much they had grown when later flying them home after weeks in hospital incubators. The plane is even equipped to deliver babies on board, if necessary. Charity fundraising As Life Flight Trust is a charitable trust, it receives all of its funding through donations. Community fundraisers to raise funds for the service are often organised by individuals or groups such as Westpac bank, or other local clubs and organisations. Other fundraising events are often put on by Life Flight itself and funds are also raised by word of mouth, online donations, and telemarketing. Due to the service's high-profile among New Zealand's rescue services, other lower profile services such as the Taranaki Air Ambulance and the Nelson Marlborough Rescue Helicopter Trust have been confused for the service, and sometimes miss out on donations as a result. TV show Life Flight was the subject of a reality TV documentary show in 2013 that ran for 10 episodes. A second season ran in 2016, also running for 10 episodes.

Today, Georgia is considered to be the birthplace and the center of the Civil Rights Movement. With a new museum dedicated to the global aspiration of Human and Civil Rights currently underway, the wisdom of peacemakers like Chief Tomochichi, Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela, and Atlanta’s Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., will be made accessible to the world. It was Tomochichi who first established our tradition of peace, having chosen to befriend General James Oglethorpe rather than massacre him and the British colonists. This friendship established native Georgia and British colonial peaceful coexistence, which lasted a century until the reprehensible Trail of Tears removed the native population. In addressing and in answer to this dark chapter in our history, the National Monuments Foundation will construct a “Trail of Peace” using allegorical sculpture and art to portray the important place native Georgians and 200 years later, native Atlantans hold in the historical striving for peace and human rights. William Verelst Painting of the Trustees of Georgia and Chief Tomochichi Chief Tomochichi and proposed monument for Historic Mims Park Settled in the 19th century by large landowners, Vine City became one of Atlanta’s earliest predominantly African- American residential neighborhoods. From the time it was first settled, there were segregated subdivisions, schools, and churches for whites and blacks. Through the years, these different peoples shaped the area’s unique character and historic importance. One such resident was Edward Wachendorff, a German immigrant who moved to Atlanta in 1867. He founded Wachendorff Brothers, one of Atlanta’s largest plant and flower nurseries, setting up greenhouses and working multiple acres of land with the main house and other buildings fronting on historic Sunset Avenue. It is from this expansive property that the name Vine City was established. Most of these buildings still stand and this nursery was one block west of Historic Mims Park. Mims Park was an initiative of Mayor Livingston Mims. Designed in the late 19th century by the Olmsted Brothers, arguably the most notable American landscape firm in American history, Mims Park also contained a playground for Atlanta’s children. Today, we have a unique opportunity to recreate Mims Park on the former grounds of the historic Wachendorff Nursery property. The topography allows the original Olmsted plan to be replicated on the new block and allows for the addition of a farm component to complement the historic park Original Olmsted Plan of Mims Park.png You enter the park through the farm center and greenhouses from Walnut Street, and will be immediately presented with the Peace Column, topped by Chief Tomochichi, on the hillside in the distance. As you proceed west through the park, there will be a series of commemorations of the city’s past among groves, lakes, and gardens. If you look to the north towards the Overlook Plaza, you will see statues of Joseph E. Boone and Dorothy Bolden. Upon reaching Vine Street, passing a statue of Ambassador Andrew Young, a look to the left on the street axis at Thurmond Street reveals a statue of Coretta Scott King, and to the right on the Joseph E. Boone Boulevard axis is a statue of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who looks south towards his alma mater, Morehouse College. Walking south, passing the wading pool, you will see a civic square with a reconstructed Carnegie Library building. Continuing along the walk, you come across the statue of Booker T. Washington, who faces across the oval his historical counterpart, W.E.B. DuBois. Continuing uphill to the Peace Column, you will reach at its base a statue of Mayor Livingston Mims, the original park founder. Climbing the staircase to the Peace Column terrace, the park’s highest point, you will discover statues of Civil Rights leaders including the Honorable Maynard Jackson, Reverend Ralph David Abernathy, the Honorable Julian Bond, and the Honorable Rodney Mims Cook, Sr. An elevator ride takes you up 80 feet to the top of the Peace Column, where the nearby Sunset Avenue Historic District is clearly visible. The homes of Martin Luther King, Maynard Jackson, and Julian Bond are indicated by bronze plaques. Reverend Abernathy’s church is also identified. A panorama of the city makes the top of the Peace Column one of the most beautiful and historic views in the nation. The organic farm within Mims Park would be managed by the residents of the neighborhood. By providing a variety of crops, the farm would bring a much needed economic engine to the community, allowing those who tend the farm to gain the market benefits of its produce. It is anticipated that the park activities will quickly spread across a renovated Sunset Avenue historic district. This growth will be encouraged by enhanced pedestrian access between facilities. Today, it is inexcusable that this vibrant and important neighborhood has lost its only major park; much less one designed by Olmsted Brothers, the prestigious landscape firm most notable for designing the U.S. Capitol Grounds and New York’s Central Park. The numerous park monuments and museum dedicated to peace and civil rights are a short walk from the new Center for Civil and Human Rights. The park will complement this pursuit with a focus on the Atlanta and Georgia contributions. Many of Atlanta’s Civil Rights leaders lived and were educated within view of Historic Mims Park. The park will draw an international audience in conjunction with nearby venues such as the Georgia Dome, Centennial Olympic Park, the Center for Civil and Human Rights, the Georgia Aquarium and the World of Coke. The primary goal is to be a center for wholesome neighborhood activity, an employment generator and a hub around which renovation will flourish. This park has received the acclaim and full support of the Mayor of Atlanta and the City Council. It is with this historic park that we will stake our claim to revitalize this important district not only for the citizens of this city and state, but also for the millions who visit here who will be inspired by those who came before us and changed the world.

He was endorsed by the Orlando Sentinel, which praised his \\"intelligence, interest and energy,\\" noting that his \\"scientific background should help him tackle complex environmental issues.\\" Sindler defeated Campbell by a wide margin, winning 64% of the vote to Campbell's 36%, and advanced to the general election, where he faced Roger Williams, the Republican nominee. During the campaign, both Sindler and Williams identified themselves as \\"conservatives,\\" though Sindler campaigned on his support for an increase in the minimum wage and stricter growth management laws, while Williams focused on education and the environment. The Sentinel once again endorsed Sindler, noting, \\"He shows promise of being a champion of excellent schools, environmental protection and other good causes.\\" Sindler ended up narrowly defeating Williams, receiving 51% of the vote to Williams' 49%. During his first term in the legislative, Sindler was pushed by Republican legislators and statewide pro-life groups to switch parties due to his conservative voting record and opposition to abortion, but declined to do so. Sindler was re-elected without opposition in 1990. In 1992, following the reconfiguration of the state's legislative districts, Sindler ran for re-election in the 38th District, which contained most of the territory that he had previously represented, and expanded slightly to include several Mount Dora precincts in Lake County. He faced Republican nominee Mike Birdsong, a former legislative aide, and Libertarian nominee Mike Miller, a military veteran, in the general election. Sindler campaigned on his legislative record, in which he passed legislation to improve the state's prison system and to help address water quality in lakes. During the campaign, Birdsong criticized Sindler for working to create the Lake Apopka Habitat Restoration and Management Board, which critics argued \\"would add an unneeded level of bureaucracy.\\" The Sentinel once again endorsed Sindler, criticizing Birdsong as \\"disappointing\\" and Miller as \\"way-out.\\" The Sentinel, while noting that Sindler had been \\"too low key,\\" praised him for his \\"worthwhile contributions\\" in the legislature. Sindler won his third term by a wide margin, receiving 53% of the vote to Birdsong's 43% and Miller's 4%. In 1994, Sindler was challenged for re-election by Republican nominee Sunny Rinker, a businesswoman and the widow of a television anchor. He was endorsed by the Sentinel, which praised him as a \\"legislative mechanic...working industriously to make the engine of government run properly.\\" Ultimately, Sindler secured a fourth term against Rinker by a wide margin, winning 54% of the vote to her 46%. When Sindler ran for re-election to his fifth and final term in the legislature in 1996, he was opposed in the Democratic primary by Carl Neidhart, a computer science instructor at the University of Central Florida. Sindler emphasized his legislative record and campaigned on his support for public education, criminal justice reform, and economic development, while Neidhart focused on his support for environmental protection. The Sentinel endorsed Sindler for re-election, noting that while he took some \\"disappointing\\" positions in the legislature, he \\"ably represented his constituents,\\" and his opponent was \\"not a viable option for voters.\\" He won the Democratic primary in a landslide, receiving 84% of the vote to Neidhart's 16%. At the start of Sindler's final term in the legislature, he voted for the Republican nominee for Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives, Daniel Webster (Florida politician), over the Democratic nominee, Buzz Ritchie, joining two other Democrats, George Crady and Bud Bronson, in doing so. In response, the House Democrats expelled Bronson, Crady, and Sindler from their caucus in a 42-6 vote. Orange County Commission In 1998, rather than seek re-election to the House, Sindler opted to run for District 2 on the Orange County Commission. He faced former County Commissioner Tom Dorman, a Republican, and Glennie Mills, a Democrat, in the nonpartisan election. The Sentinel endorsed Sindler over Dorman and Mills, citing his \\"track record of political experience\\" and his \\"ability to work with lawmakers in both parties,\\" while noting that his opponents \\"can't claim the same resume.\\" Sindler ended up winning in a landslide, receiving 57% of the vote to Dorman's 29% and Mills' 13%. Following Sindler's unopposed re- election in 2002, he was deployed to Afghanistan as an officer in the United States Army Reserve, where he first worked as a veterinary officer before serving as a liaison between the military and Afghan government officials. Sindler declined to ask the Governor to appoint a temporary replacement during his service, instead opting to run his office by using his aides as proxies and through email. In 2006, Sindler initially announced that he would run once again for the State House in the 38th District, but ultimately withdrew from the race after failing to resign from his County Commission post under Florida's resign-to-run law. 2016 State Senate campaign In 2016, Sindler announced that he would run for the Florida Senate in the 11th District, following incumbent State Senator Geraldine Thompson's decision to run for Congress. Sindler faces State Representative Randolph Bracy, environmental activist Chuck O'Neal, and former State Senator Gary Siplin in the Democratic primary. Controversy In 2004, Sindler and his wife were arrested and charged with domestic battery. During an argument about their lawn, Sindler allegedly \\"made a rude comment to his wife,\\" who threw a water bottle at him, prompting Sindler to punch her in the chest. Ultimately, charges were dropped against Sindler and his wife.

Transition metal alkyl complexes are coordination complexes that contain a bond between a transition metal and an alkyl ligand. Such complexes are not only pervasive but are of practical and theoretical interest.  Scope  Most metal alkyl complexes contain other, non-alkyl ligands. Great interest, mainly theoretical, has focused on the homoleptic complexes. Indeed, the first reported example of a complex containing a metal-sp3 carbon bond was the homoleptic complex diethylzinc. Other examples include hexamethyltungsten, tetramethyltitanium, and tetranorbornylcobalt. :Structure of diethylzinc. The Zn-C bonds measure 194.8(5) pm, while the C-Zn-C angle is slightly bent with 176.2(4)°. Mixed ligand, or heteroleptic, complexes containing alkyls are numerous. In nature, vitamin B12 and its many derivatives contain reactive Co- alkyl bonds. :Hexamethyltungsten is an example of a \\"homoleptic\\" (all ligands being the same) metal alkyl complex. Preparation Metal alkyl complexes are prepared generally by two pathways, use of alkyl nuncleophiles and use of alkyl electrophiles. Nucleophilic sources of alkyl ligands include Grignard reagents and organolithium compounds. Since many strong nucleophiles are also potent reductants, mildly nucleophilic alkylating agents are sometimes employed to avoid redox reactions. Organozinc compounds and organoaluminium compounds are such milder reagents. Electrophilic alkylation commonly starts with low valence metal complexes. Typical electrophilic reagents are alkyl halides. Illustrative is the preparation of the methyl derivative of cyclopentadienyliron dicarbonyl anion: :CpFe(CO)2Na + CH3I → CpFe(CO)2CH3 \\\\+ NaI Many metal alkyls are prepared by oxidative addition: :475px An example is the reaction of a Vaska's complex with methyl iodide. Structure of the alkyl complex (C2H5)TiCl3(dmpe), highlighting an agostic interaction between the methyl group and the Ti(IV) center. Agostic interactions and beta-hydride elimination Some metal alkyls feature agostic interactions between a C-H bond on the alkyl group and the metal. Such interactions are especially common for complexes of early transition metals in their highest oxidation states. One determinant of the kinetic stability of metal-alkyl complexes is the presence of hydrogen at the position beta to the metal. If such hydrogens are present and if the metal center is coordinatively unsaturated, then the complex can undergo beta-hydride elimination to form a metal-alkene complex: center These conversions are assumed to proceed via the intermediacy of agostic interactions. Catalysis Many homogeneous catalysts operate via the intermediacy of metal alkyls. These reactions include hydrogenation, hydroformylation, alkene isomerization, and olefin polymerization. It is assumed that the corresponding heterogeneous reactions also involve metal- alkyl bonds.

The CHDF was active during the 1970s, and was officially disbanded in 1986 after the People Power Revolution. However, the creation of the Citizen Armed Force Geographical Unit in 1987 provided the opportunity for CHDF members to once again perform their former duties. Creation The Philippine Constabulary recruited, organized and equipped official civilian militia during the Hukbalahap Rebellion after World War II. After the Hukbalahap were effectively suppressed in 1956, these militia units were organized into \\"Barrio Self-Defense Units\\". In 1972, Ferdinand E. Marcos declared martial law in the Philippines. One of the terms of the 1973 martial law-era Philippine Constitution was the establishment of the \\"Self-Defense Forces\\" to help combat the Islamic insurgency in Mindanao and later the Communist insurgency. In 1977, Marcos issued Presidential Decree No. 1016, formally establishing the Integrated Civilian Home Defense Forces for the purpose of maintenance of peace and order. At its inception, the CHDF numbered 73,000 men, and became a notorious human rights violator. In July 1987, Corazon Aquino issued Executive Order 275, dissolving the CHDF and other paramilitary units. However, that same month she issued Executive Order 264, establishing the Citizen Armed Force Geographical Unit on the advice of then-Defense Secretary Fidel V. Ramos. Former members, between 25%-70%, of the disbanded CHDF were then integrated into the CAFGU. Organization Over-all organization, training and equipment was provided by the Department of National Defense, while screening and appointment of actual members was carried out by the military provincial commander upon the recommendation of the local government heads and the Chief of the Philippine Constabulary. Deployment and utilization of the CHDF troops fell under the supervision of the provincial governor, city and municipal mayors, who coordinated with military and Integrated National Police units in areas under the jurisdiction of the local government.

Le Guin, first published in the collection New Dimensions 1, edited by Robert Silverberg. It is set in the fictional Hainish universe, where Earth is a member of an interstellar \\"League of Worlds\\". The anthology was released in United States in 1971, by Doubleday Books. The story follows an exploratory ship sent by the League to investigate a newly discovered planet, named World 4470. The team includes Osden, an \\"empath\\" who is able to feel the emotions of those around him; however, he has an abrasive personality that leads to tensions within the team. The ship finds World 4470 to be a world covered in forests, and apparently devoid of animal life. However, the team eventually begins to feel a fear emanating from the planet. The team realizes that the entire vegetation on the planet is part of a singular consciousness, which is reacting in fear at the explorers after spending its whole life in isolation. Like Le Guin's earlier novel The Word for World Is Forest, this story examines the relationship between humans and their natural environment. The story also makes repeated references to the poetry of Andrew Marvell, including in the title. The story was republished in Le Guin's collections The Wind's Twelve Quarters and Buffalo Gals and Other Animal Presences, as well as in many other anthologies. It was nominated for the Hugo Award in 1972. Background and setting \\"Vaster than Empires and More Slow\\" is set in the fictional Hainish universe, which Le Guin introduced in her first novel Rocannon's World, published in 1966. In this alternate history, human beings did not evolve on Earth, but on Hain. The people of Hain colonized many neighboring planetary systems, including Terra (Earth) and Athshe, possibly a million years before the setting of the novels. The planets subsequently lost contact with each other, for reasons that Le Guin does not explain. Le Guin does not narrate the entire history of the Hainish universe at once, instead letting readers piece it together from various works. The novels and other fictional works set in the Hainish universe recount the efforts to re-establish a galactic civilization. Explorers from Hain as well as other planets use interstellar ships taking years to travel between planetary systems, although the journey is shortened for the travelers due to relativistic time dilation. \\"Vaster than Empires\\" is set soon after the formation of the League of All Worlds, at a time when the League is still sending out exploratory ships to investigate new planets. \\"Vaster than Empires,\\" like other works such as The Word for World Is Forest and \\"The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas\\" explore worlds that have gone wrong in some way. The title of the story is taken from a poem by Andrew Marvell, titled \\"To His Coy Mistress\\". The line from which the title is derived reads \\"Our vegetable love should grow/Vaster than empires, and more slow.\\" In the internal chronology of the Hainish cycle, \\"Vaster than Empires\\" takes place after The Dispossessed and before The Word for World is Forest. Plot summary \\"Vaster than Empires\\" follows the crew of a survey ship sent by the League of Worlds to a planet far outside the region of the galaxy it has previously colonized. The crew consists of 10 people, including five Terrans (people from Earth). One of the crew members, named Osden, is an \\"empath\\"; he has the ability to feel the emotions of any sentient creatures around him, including humans. His abilities are depicted as being the result of his being treated for autism. The team is led by Tomiko Haito, a woman of East-Asian descent, whose official title is \\"coordinator\\". Tensions among the team members run high from the very beginning; in addition to several neurotic personalities, Osden's abrasive personality causes the others to dislike him intensely. The team arrives at the planet, named World 4470. They find it completely covered in vegetation, and seemingly devoid of intelligent life. Osden, whose role is to sense the presence of sentient beings, senses nothing. After some exploration, the scientists find that there is nothing resembling animal life on the planet; all of its life-forms are either photosynthetic, or feed off of dead plant material. Due to the tensions between Osden and the rest, he is sent alone to do a species survey in the forest. While he is still out alone, Porlock, one of the scientists on the team, is scared by what he believes to be a large ape in the forest. The other team members investigate for a couple of days, without finding anything, before Osden fails to contact them at a pre-assigned time. Tomiko leads three others to his camp in the forest, where they find him knocked out, apparently by an unknown assailant. They bring him back to camp, where he gradually recovers, and tells the group that he had felt a strong fear response from the forest itself. Tomiko realizes that the assailant must have been one of the other team members. While Osden is asleep, the fear emanations from the forest drive Porlock to verbally lash out at Osden, and admit to trying to kill him in the forest. Porlock attempts to assault Osden again, but the others restrain him and place him under a sedative. The team decides to try a different location on the planet, in the hope of moving away from the sentience they believe to be in the forest. They find that the fear emanations can be felt at their new camp as well, which is in a grassland, which makes them realize that the sentience extends over all of the vegetation on the planet. Osden also realizes that this sentience has never been in contact with anything alien before; thus it experienced fear when the explorers landed. Osden decides to attempt to communicate with the sentience, with the help of Tomiko and two others. They land in the middle of a forest, where a surge in the fear response kills one of them. Osden leaves the group, and by surrendering to the fear completely makes the planet understand that they mean it no harm; and the fear emanations cease. The group tries to locate Osden, but is unable to find him; Tomiko suspects that he does not want to be found. They leave him enough provisions for the rest of his life, and return to Terra after finishing the survey. Themes A major theme in this story is that of a symbiotic relationship between a planet and its inhabitants, similar to that in The Word for World Is Forest. In her introduction to the story, Le Guin stated \\"We all have forests in our minds. Forests unexplored, unending. Each of us gets lost in the forests, every night, alone.\\" The \\"vegetable love\\" referred to in the poem from which the title is taken can be used to describe the final relationship between Osden and the planetary intelligence of World 4470. When Osden is attacked by Porlock in the planet, he transmits his fear to the planet, which amplifies it and reflects it back at him. Thus Osden's role is similar to that of Selver in The Word for World is Forest, in that he introduces violence to the forest world. The intelligence of Le Guin's forest has been contrasted to the \\"low\\" position occupied by vegetative beings in the works of other science fiction authors such as Arthur C. Clarke. An additional similarity between The Word for World Is Forest and \\"Vaster than Empires\\" is the theme of first contact between humans and a new environment. In \\"Vaster than Empires,\\" the forest is both the setting for the story and a character in it. The forest directly responds to the humans with fear, a response that is similar to the response of Osden, the empath, to the rest of society: \\"the normal defensive-aggressive reaction between strangers meeting.\\" Thus Le Guin makes an analogy between contact between humans and aliens, and contact between individual humans; both are contact between the self and the \\"other\\". Osden is depicted as having a strong empathetic connection with the vegetated planet visited by the explorers. This is in contrast to the sharply antagonistic relationship that the other members of the team have with him. The team is depicted as a dysfunctional group, with each individual having quirks and oddities of their own. They are regarded as being of \\"unsound mind\\" by the people of Earth and Hain, because they were willing to travel on a voyage that lasted 500 years of actual time. The fear transmitted by the forest drives them further into their neuroticism. In contrast, Osden the empath surrenders completely to the forest, and thus achieves a mental unity with the planet. In choosing a sort of union with the planet, Osden shows that the singular consciousness of the vegetative creature is preferable to the chaos and discord in human society. At the conclusion of the story Tomiko describes Osden's relationship with the planet, saying \\"He had taken the fear into himself, and, accepting, had transcended it. He had given up his self to the alien, and unreserved surrender, that left no place for evil. He had learned the love of the Other and thereby had been given his whole self.\\" Osden achieves a completely empathetic relationship with the planet, \\"both literally and figuratively in touch with the forest;\\" which also grants him temporary goodwill towards humans, as he says \\"Listen, I will you well\\" before leaving his colleagues. Le Guin makes another reference to Marvell's poetry at the conclusion of the story, which refers to the notion of a planetary consciousness. Marvell's poem \\"The Garden\\" speaks of \\"a green thought in a green shade\\"; Le Guin describes World 4470 as \\"one big green thought.\\" Le Guin's depiction of the planetary vegetative intelligence is of something that is \\"whole, undifferentiated and unconscious.\\" Thus, it finds the very concept of other beings terrifying, and it is qualitatively different from animal intelligences. Reception Lynda Schneekloth described \\"Vaster than Empires\\" as \\"one of the most interesting explorations of a vegetative sentience,\\" in the magazine Extrapolation. \\"Vaster than Empires\\" was anthologized in the collection Science Fiction: A Historical Anthology, edited by Eric S. Rabkin. In his introduction to the story, Rabkin stated that it \\"takes the frenzy of exploration and science, paints it green, and frames it with stability.\\" He described the story as having an expansive and hopeful vision of a peaceful world, in contrast to the constant warfare of reality. In contrast, Elizabeth Cummins described the work as \\"exploring the limits of utopia.\\" Publication and awards \\"Vaster than Empires and More Slow\\" was first published in the collection New Dimensions 1, edited by Robert Silverberg. The anthology was released in United States in 1971, by Doubleday Books. It has since been reprinted in several collections and anthologies, including in The Wind's Twelve Quarters and Buffalo Gals and Other Animal Presences, which are collections of Le Guin's stories and poetry. The story was dramatized in the National Public Radio series 2000X, which aired on 11 April 2000. The story was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Short Story in 1972, and came 14th in a poll for the Locus Award for Best Short Story. References Sources      External links * *Ursula K.

He played college football at the University of Wisconsin, Arizona Western College, and the University of South Carolina. Early years Born to Tina and Steve McEvoy, McEvoy grew up in Hillsdale, New Jersey. He attended Bergen Catholic High School in Oradell, New Jersey where he played football and basketball. McEvoy graduated from Bergen Catholic in 2011. College career McEvoy verbally committed to the South Carolina Gamecocks on January 20, 2011 to play quarterback. McEvoy redshirted his first year on campus. On July 30, 2012, McEvoy was arrested in North Carolina and charged with speeding and driving after consuming alcohol while under age 21. On August 7, eight days after his arrest, McEvoy announced that he was going to transfer from South Carolina. McEvoy transferred to Arizona Western prior to start of 2012 season. McEvoy appeared in 10 games during the 2012 season at the quarterback position passing for 2,301 yard with 29 touchdowns and rushing for six more. McEvoy transferred to the University of Wisconsin where he played from the 2013 season through the 2015 season. McEvoy played in 38 games splitting time between playing at safety, quarterback, and wide receiver. Professional career On January 13, 2016, McEvoy participated in the College Gridiron Showcase in Bedford, Texas. Unfortunately, McEvoy did not receive an invitation to the NFL Combine, most likely due to his time playing multiple positions at Wisconsin and not being a top prospect at a single position. On March 9, 2016, he attended Wisconsin's pro day, where he performed positional drills and combine drills, but chose not to run the 40-yard dash due to tendinitis in his knee. At the conclusion of the pre-draft process, McEvoy was projected to go undrafted and be signed as a free agent. He was ranked the 20th best wide receiver prospect by NFLDraftScout.com. =Seattle Seahawks= On May 1, 2016, the Seattle Seahawks signed McEvoy as an undrafted free agent after he went unselected in the 2016 NFL Draft. The Seahawks signed him to a three-year, $1.62 million contract. 2016 season: Rookie year Throughout rookie minicamp, organized team activities, and spring training, McEvoy was used at the safety position. Upon arriving at training camp, he was moved to wide receiver and competed for a roster spot against Kenny Lawler, Antwan Goodley, Deshon Foxx, Kasen Williams, Tyler Slavin, Kevin Smith, and Douglas McNeil. Head coach Pete Carroll tried him out at tight end after Jimmy Graham and Nick Vannett suffered injuries and Cooper Helfet was waived. In his first preseason game against the Kansas City Chiefs, McEvoy caught a 37-yard touchdown pass from Trevone Boykin as time expired, along with two other receptions to total 77-yards. The Seahawks went on to win 17-16 after scoring on the subsequent two-point conversion. Despite missing some time in training camp with a groin injury, McEvoy avoided the Seahawks' practice squad and won the fifth wide receiver position, beating out Kenny Lawler. Head coach Pete Carroll made him the fifth wide receiver on the Seahawks' depth chart behind veterans Doug Baldwin, Tyler Lockett, Jermaine Kearse and Paul Richardson. McEvoy made his NFL debut in the Seahawks' season- opening 12-10 victory over the Miami Dolphins. On October 2, 2016, McEvoy made his first NFL reception for a 42-yard touchdown during the Seahawks' 27-17 victory at the New York Jets. He made the catch on a pass from Russell Wilson after Jets' safety Calvin Pryor blew his zone coverage and fell down, allowing McEvoy to become wide open for a 42-yard touchdown. During a Week 7 matchup at the Arizona Cardinals, McEvoy blocked a punt attempt by Cardinals' punter Ryan Quigley in the fourth quarter that was recovered by Seahawks' defensive end Cassius Marsh. The blocked punt and recovery helped send the game into overtime with a 3-3 tie, but resulted in a 6-6 tie at the end of the game. The following week, McEvoy received a lateral from Russell Wilson and threw his first career pass attempt for a 43-yard completion to running back C. J. Prosise in the second quarter of the Seahawks' 25-20 loss at the New Orleans Saints. On December 11, 2016, he had a season-high three receptions for 41 receiving yards and scored a 22-yard touchdown reception in the fourth quarter of a 38-10 loss at the Green Bay Packers. He finished his rookie season with a total of nine receptions for 140 receiving yards and two touchdowns in 14 games and zero starts. McEvoy was a healthy scratch for Weeks 2 and 10. 2017 season McEvoy returned to training camp in 2017 and competed with Kenny Lawler, Amara Darboh, Marcus Lucas, David Moore, Kasen Williams, Rodney Smith, Darreus Rogers, and Cyril Grayson. He became the Seahawks' fourth wide receiver, behind Doug Baldwin, Paul Richardson, and Tyler Lockett, after the Seahawks traded Jermaine Kearse to the New York Jets. On October 29, 2017, McEvoy made a 53-yard reception during Seattle's 41-38 victory over the Houston Texans. During a Week 12 contest at the San Francisco 49ers, he had a season-high two catches for 32 receiving yards in a 24-13 victory. Overall, in the 2017 season, he finished with five receptions for 113 yards. On August 26, 2018, McEvoy was waived by the Seahawks. =New Orleans Saints= On August 29, 2018, McEvoy was signed by the New Orleans Saints.

About 99.9% of the DNA-sequence in the human genome is conserved between individuals from all over the world, but some variation does exist. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are considered to be the largest contributor to genetic variation in humans since they are so abundant and easily detectable. It is estimated that there are at least 10 million SNPs within the human population but there are also many other types of genetic variants and they occur at dramatically different scales. The variation between genomes in the human population range from single nucleotide polymorphisms to dramatic alterations in the human karyotype. Human genetic variation is responsible for the phenotypic differences between individuals in the human population. There are different types of genetic variation and it is studied extensively in order to better understand its significance. These studies lead to discoveries associating genetic variants to certain phenotypes as well as their implications in disease. At first, before DNA sequencing technologies, variation was studied and observed exclusively at a microscopic scale. At this scale, the only observations made were differences in chromosome number and chromosome structure. These variants that are about 3 Mb or larger in size are considered microscopic structural variants. This scale is large enough to be visualized using a microscope and include aneuploidies, heteromorphisms, and chromosomal rearrangements. When DNA sequencing was introduced, it opened the door to finding smaller and incredibly more sequence variations including SNPs and minisatellites. This also includes small inversions, duplications, insertions, and deletions that are under 1 kb in size. In the human genome project the human genome was successfully sequenced, which provided a reference human genome for comparison of genetic variation. With improving sequencing technologies and the reference genome, more and more variations were found of several different sizes that were larger than 1 kb but smaller than microscopic variants. These variants ranging from about 1 kb to 3 Mb in size are considered submicroscopic structural variants. These recently discovered structural variants are thought to play a very significant role in phenotypic diversity and disease susceptibility.  Types of structural variants  Structural variation is an important type of human genetic variation that contributes to phenotypic diversity. There are microscopic and submicroscopic structural variants which include deletions, duplications, and large copy number variants as well as insertions, inversions, and translocations. These are several different types of structural variants in the human genome and they are quite distinctive from each other. A translocation is a chromosomal rearrangement, at the inter- or intra-chromosomal level, where a section of a chromosome changes position but with no change in the whole DNA content. A Section of DNA that is larger than 1 kb and occurs in two or more copies per haploid genome, in which the different copies share greater than 90% of the same sequence, are considered to be segmental duplications or low-copy repeats. These are only a few of the several different types of structural variants that have been known to exist in the human genome. A table visualizing these different forms of structural variants, as well as others, is shown in Figure 1. An inversion is a section of DNA on a chromosome that is reversed in its orientation in comparison to the reference genome. There have been many studies identifying inversions because they have been found to have a big role in many diseases. A study found that forty percent of haemophilia A patients had a factor 8 gene inversion of a certain region that was four hundred kb in size. The inversion breakpoint was found to be around a segmental duplication which is observed in many other inversion events. It is difficult to completely understand how each structural variant is created. It was previously known that repeated sequences on a chromosome increases the probability of non allelic homologous recombination. These repeated sequences could cause deletions, duplications, inversions, and inverted duplication chromosomes. The products of this mechanism from the sequence repeats is depicted in Figure 2. A study was done on the olfactory receptor gene clusters where they questioned if there was an association between normal rearrangement of 8p and the repeated inverted sequences. The researchers observed that the rearrangement of chromosomes was actually caused by the homologous recombination in the 8p-reps. Therefore, they concluded that the substrate used in order to make rearrangements at the intrachromosomal level are the genes for olfactory receptors. This discovery revealed the role that inverted duplicates have in affecting the development of structural variants. The mechanisms and ways in which structural variants are produced are important to better understand the development of these type of genetic variants. Structural Variation Mechanism = Copy-number variation = Copy-number variants are defined as sections of DNA that exist in a variable copy number when comparing it to the reference genome and are larger than 1 kb in size. This definition is broad and includes deletions, duplications, and large copy number variants. If the copy number variant is present in 1% or more of the population then it is also considered a copy-number polymorphism. There was a study on the global variation in copy number in the human genome which questioned the characteristics of copy number variants in the human genome. It was known that copy number variation in the human genome is important but at this point of time, it had not yet been fully understood. Human genome variation itself is very diverse as there are many types including inversions, duplication, SNPs, and other forms. They surveyed the genomes of 270 individuals, from a variety of populations, for copy number variants with technologies such as SNP arrays. Their results showed that many copy number variants had specific arrangements of linkage disequilibrium which revealed the copy number variation in all of the different populations. The study concluded that twelve percent of the genome contained CNVRs. They were found to be involved in more of the DNA in each genome than single nucleotide polymorphisms. This was a remarkable discovery since single nucleotide polymorphisms have been known to be the greatest in number in the human genome. In terms of size, however, these type of structural variants were found to have a larger presence in the human genome. The copy number variants continued to be studied as several studies continued to reveal the depth of their presence and their significance. A study was conducted that questioned the role of the organization of copy number variants and wondered what type of duplications they are. It was known that copy number variation plays a big role in many human diseases but at the time large scale studies of these duplications had not been done. They decided to sequence 130 breakpoints from 112 individuals that contained 119 known CNVs by doing whole genome sequencing as well as next generation sequencing. They found that tandem duplications comprised 83% of the CNVs while 8.4% were triplications, 4.2% were adjacent duplications, 2.5% were insertional translocations, and 1.7% were other complex rearrangements. The copy number variants were predominantly tandem duplications which made it the most common type of copy number variant in the human genome according to the results of the study on this population. More was needed on the mechanistic side of the formation of structural variants. There was a study that focused on the mechanisms of very interesting and rare pathogenic copy number variants. The researchers knew that copy number variation is important in genome structural variation and contributes to human genetic disease but the actual mechanisms of most of the new and few pathogenic copy number variants had not been known. They used sequencing technologies to sequence breakpoint areas of many rare pathogenic copy number variants which was the biggest and most in depth analysis of copy number variants. They saw that the genomic architectural features were very important in the human genome and they were associated with about eighty-one percent of breakpoints. They concluded that tandem duplications and microdeletions that are rare and pathogenic do not happen in the human genome by chance. Instead, they arise from many different genomic architectural features. It was a very interesting result in that the certain architectural features of the genome physically made it possible and probable to develop certain rare and pathogenic structural variants. Structural variation can be seen as an avenue of genome modification for adaptation by evolution. A study was conducted on ancestral diet and the evolution of the human amylase gene copy number. The consumption of starch became a huge component of the human diet with the development of agricultural societies. Amylase is the enzyme that breaks down starch and its copy number varies. These observations led to the question of whether or not the differences in starch consumption between different populations created natural selection pressures on the enzyme amylase. They tested for the differences in the amylase protein expression in saliva from different populations and compared their expression to their copy number in their respective genomes. Then they compared the starch consumption of different populations to their copy number of the amylase gene. They found that there was more amylase protein expression in saliva from people that had higher amylase copy number in their genome and there was also an association between groups of people with high starch diets and a larger amylase gene copy number. This study brought exciting results as structural variation proved an involvement in the evolution of the human population by increasing its amylase copy number over time. The 1000 genomes project was able to successfully produce the DNA sequence of the human genome. They provided much sequencing data from many populations to analyze as well as a reference human genome for comparison and future studies. One study took advantage of this resource to question the structural variation differences between genomes from whole genome sequence data. It was known that human diseases are affected by duplications and deletions and that copy number analysis is common but multiallelic copy number variants (mCNVs) were not as well studied. The researchers got their data from the 1000 genomes project and analyzed 849 different genomes from a variety of populations that were sequenced in order to find large mCNVs. From their analysis, they found that mCNVs create most genetic variation in gene dosage compared to other structural variants and that the gene expression variation is created by the dosage diversity of genes created by mCNVs. The study underlined the great significance that structural variants, especially mCNVs, have on gene dosage which leads to variable gene expressions and human phenotypic diversity in the population.  Implications in disease  = Charcot-Marie Tooth (CMT) disease = There are several structural variants in the human genome that have been observed but have not led to any obvious phenotypic effects. There are some, however, that play a role in gene dosage which could lead to genetic diseases or distinct phenotypes. Structural variants can directly affect gene expression, such as with copy-number variants, or indirectly through position effects. These effects can have significant implications in susceptibility to disease. The first gene dosage effect that was observed, and considered to be an autosomal dominant disease from an inherited DNA rearrangement, was Charcot-Marie Tooth (CMT) disease. Most of the associations found with CMT were with a 1.5 Mb tandem duplication in 17p11.2-p12 at the PMP22 gene. The proposed mechanism for the structural variation is shown in Figure 2. When an individual has three copies of the normal gene, it results in the disease phenotype. If the individual had only one copy of the PMP22 gene, on the other hand, the result was a clinically different heredity neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies. The differences in gene dosage created vastly different disease phenotypes which revealed the significant role that structural variation has on phenotype and susceptibility to disease. = HIV susceptibility = Structural variation studies became increasingly popular due to the discovery of their possible roles and effects in the human genome. Copy number variation is a very important type of structural variation and has been studied extensively. A study on the influence of the CCL3L1 gene on HIV-1/AIDS susceptibility tested if the copy number of the CCL3L1 gene had any effect on an individual’s susceptibility to HIV-1/AIDS. They sampled several different individuals and populations for their CCL3L1 copy number and compared it to their HIV acquirement risk. They found that there is an association between higher amounts in the copy number of CCL3L1 and susceptibility to HIV and AIDS since individuals who were more prone to HIV had a low copy number of CCL3L1. This difference in copy number was shown to play a possibly significant role in HIV susceptibility due to this association. Another study that focused on the pathogenesis of human obesity tested if structural variation of the NPY4R gene was significant in obesity. Studies had previously shown that 10q11.22 CNV had an association with obesity and that several copy number variants were associated with obesity. Their CNV analysis revealed that the NPY4R gene had a much higher frequency of 10q11.22 CNV loss in the patient population. The control population, on the other hand, had more CNV gain in the same region. This led the researchers to conclude that the NPY4R gene played an important role in the pathogenesis of obesity due to its copy number variation. Studies involving copy number variation as well as other structural variants have brought new insights to the significant roles that structural variants play in the human genome. = Schizophrenia = The factors that contribute to the development of schizophrenia have been studied extensively. A very recent study was conducted on the mechanism and genes responsible for schizophrenia development. It had been previously shown that variation at an MHC locus was associated with the development of schizophrenia. This study found that the association is caused partly by the complement component 4 (C4) genes and therefore implying that allele variants of the C4 genes contribute to the development of schizophrenia. Linkage disequilibrium helped researchers identify which C4 structural variant an individual had by looking at the SNP haplotypes. The SNP haplotypes and the C4 alleles were linked which was why they were in linkage disequilibrium, meaning that they segregated together. A single structural C4 variant was associated with many different SNP haplotypes, but different SNP haplotypes where associated with only one C4 structural variant. This was due to the linkage disequilibrium which allowed the researchers to determine the C4 structural variant easily by looking at the SNP haplotype. Their data suggested this because the results showed that the structural variants of C4 express the C4A protein at different levels and this difference in higher C4A protein expressions were associated with higher rates of schizophrenia development. The different structural variant alleles of the same gene were shown to have different phenotypes and susceptibility to disease. These studies exhibit the breadth of the involvement and significance of structural variation on the human genome. Its importance is demonstrated with its contribution to phenotypic diversity and disease susceptibility.  Future directions  Many studies have been conducted to better understand human genome structural variation. There have been great advances in the research but its significance is still not fully understood. There are several questions still left unanswered which beg for further studies on the subject. Current studies usually target “unique” areas of the genome but are not able to detect the phenotypic effect of structural variants in highly repetitive, duplicated, and complex genomic areas. It is very difficult to study this with the genomic technology of today but this may change with future development of sequencing technologies. In order to better understand the phenotypic effect of structural variants, large databases of genotypes and phenotypes of individuals must be created in order to make accurate associations. Huge projects such as Deciphering Developmental Disorders, UK10K, and International Standards for Cytogenomic Arrays Consortium have already paved the way to create databases for researchers to more easily pursue these studies. In addition, there has been growth and development in technology to create induced pluripotent stem cells with specific diseases. This introduces appropriate model systems to recreate disease causing structural variants such as translocations, duplications, and inversions. The future advancement in technologies and large database efforts will help lead the way to better quality studies and a much better understanding of human genome structural variation.

It roughly corresponded to the present province of Kwilu. Location The Free State was annexed by Belgium in 1908 as the Belgian Congo. In 1933 the original four provinces were reorganized into six provinces, named after their capitals, and the central government assumed more control. The Congo-Kasaï province was split into Léopoldville and Lusambo (Kasai). The number of districts was reduced to 15. A map of the districts in 1933 shows Kwango District in Léopoldville Province. It is bordered by Portuguese possessions to the south, Bas-Congo District to the west, Lac Léopold II District to the north and Kasai District to the east. By 1954 Kwango District had been split into a smaller Kwango District in the south and Kwilu District in the north. Kwilu was bordered by Lac Leopold II District to the north, Kasai District to the east and Kwango District to the south and west. It covered essentially the same territory as the present Kwilu Province. The area was out of a total of for Leopoldville province as a whole. Post- Independance Léopoldville Province was divided in 1963–1966 into the provinces of Congo Central, Kwilu, Kwango, and Mai-Ndombe. Bandundu Province was formed in 1966 by merging Kwilu, Kwango and Mai-Ndombe. As of 2008 Kwilu District contained the territories of Bagata, Bulungu, Masi-Manimba, Gungu and Idiofa.

It was first discovered and isolated in 1978. It is a potyvirus, also known as the Helium virus Y, and is often abbreviated as HelVY or HVY. It shows some relationship with viruses like the lettuce mosaic virus, bean yellow mosaic virus, and potato virus Y.https://www.apsnet.org/publications/phytopathology/backissues/Documents/1978Articles/Phyto68n10_1407.PDF Based on morphology, HVY belongs to the subdivision II of the potyvirus group.  Helenium virus Y hosts, strains and symptoms  HVY belongs to the potyvirus genus. The potyvirus genus is currently the largest of the plant virus groups, creating an optimal intracellular environment for viral translation and replication. It is one of two strains to specifically affect Helenium hybrids, the other strain being Helenium virus S, a carlavirus. The host of HVY is the Helenium amarum hybrids as well as certain breeds of Chenopodium. While the hybrids can be affected by other plant viruses such as the tobacco ringspot virus, HVY tends to primarily affect the Helenium amarum hybrids. Symptoms of infection include discoloration of the flowers, leaf distortion, leaf mosaic, ringspots on leaves, growth reduction of leaves and flower heads, and stunting of development of the internodes. Some cases of HVY infections, such as infections in C. quinoa, G. globosa, C. amaranticolor, and C. album have led to chlorotic local lesions.  Helenium virus Y transmission  HVY is mechanically transmitted from plant to plant, often through hosts like aphids. Like many potyviruses, HVY replication occurs in the cytoplasm, nuclei, chloroplasts, and the Golgi apparatus.

Radhavallabha is a Vaishnava denomination which began with the Vaishnava theologian Hith Harivansh Mahaprabhu. Hariram Vyas together with Hith Harivansh Mahaprabhu and Swami Haridas are known as Haritraya (Trinity of Hari). He is considered to be an incarnation or descension of Vishakha Sakhi who is considered to be the foremost sakhi of Radharani. He is credited with a large body of devotional compositions, especially in the Dhrupad style. His work influenced both the classical music and the Bhakti movements of North India, especially those devoted to Krishna's consort Radha. As a poet he is credited for bringing development of Krshna-Bhakti literature to light in the pages of Indian history. Rupa Goswami, Sanatana Goswami, Mahaprabhu Vallabhacharya, Vitthalnath (Gusainji), and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu were his contemporaries. Life and background Hariram Vyas Ji was born in the year 1512 in a sanadhya brahmin family in Orchha, Bundelkhand. His father Shri Sumokhan Shukl was a follower of Madhva tradition, he was a respected man in his community, and Rajguru(royal priest) of the Orchha royal family. Hariram ji showed a keen interest in Sanskrit from an early age and achieved great mastery of Vedas and Holy Scriptures at a young age. He was soon appointed as the Rajguru(Royal priest) to King Madhukar Shah of Orchha. Apart from being an renowned pandit and intellectual he was also famous for his debating skills. In his early years he was obsessed with debating with other intellectuals and had defeated many famous Pundits. He would go and do Shashtrarth (debate) with any Pundit he would hear about and win the debate with his knowledge. But, this phase of his life didn't last very long. Soon, he gave up engaging in meaningless debates, shallow arguments and was completely devoted to the bhakti-marg. He soon renounced his home, family, wealth, and his position as the rajguru of Orchha king and came to Vrindavan. There he lived his life as a vagabond and spent time in satsang with saints like Hith Harivansh Mahaprabhu and Swami Haridas. There are many disagreements and contradicting theories about who his diksha - guru was. One theory suggests that he was initiated into Madhva tradition by his father Sumokhan Shukl and that his deviation from the tradition and his interest towards Krishn bhakti was inspired by the preachings of his father's guru Sanyasi Madhavdas. And, finally after hearing a doha written by Sant Navaldas he followed his inner voice and came to the epicenter of madhura bhakti - Vrindavan where he began his satsang with Shri Haridas and Hit Harivansh. Another popular theory suggests that after hearing about the popularity of Hith Harivansh Mahaprabhu he came to Vrindavan and challenged him for a debate. But, upon hearing one of his dohas became his disciple. Vyas Ji's father Sumokhan Shukl had been a disciple of and received Madhva tradition diksha from Shri Madhavdas who was Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's guru-bhai. And, Vyas Ji had received diksha from his father in the same tradition. Hence, even though he was not a direct disciple of Madhavdas, he comes under his Guru-Shishya tradition. Vyas Ji in his Sanskrit work called 'Navratna' has also clearly mentioned that he considers himself to belong to Madhva tradition. But, in his later years he felt a pull towards Hith Harivansh Mahaprabhu's Radha-Vallabha tradition. This is the reason we can find both Dvaita philosophy of Madhva tradition together with the devotional worship elements of the Radha-Vallabha tradition. While one of his son was a disciple of Hith Harivansh Mahaprabhu's son Vanchandra Ji, his other son Kishoredas received diksha from Swami Haridas. This shows that Vyas Ji respected all traditions equally. Poetry and other works Hariram Ji's poems, couplets, dohas were largely composed in Braj bhasha. However he has composed and written in Sanskrit as well. Apart from devotional dohas or couplets, he also wrote couplets on life principles, morality, and stories of his times. He is said to have composed thousands of couplets and dohas. But the exact number is not known. Some of his known major devotional dohas, poems in Braj bhasha have been compiled and published in a book called Shri Vyas Vani. Other works include 1) Raagmala (Hindi/Braj Bhasha) 2) Navratna (Sanskrit) 3) Swadharm Paddati (Sanskrit) His complete life and works have also been documented by Vasudev Goswami in his book Bhakt Kavi Vyas Ji. Vyas Ji has praised saints and devotees in many of his poems. He has specifically named, appreciated and expressed his gratitude towards many contemporary and earlier saints and devotees for removing his own ignorance and doubts through their works, poems and held them in high regard like his Gurus. Here are a couple of illustrations talking about Hit Harivansh. उपदेस्यो रसिकन प्रथम,तब पाये हरिवंश। जब हरिवंश कृपा करी ,मिठे व्यास के संश॥ (Shri Vyas Vani, Pad 14, Pg. 194) Such dohas by Vyas Ji have given strength to the theory that Harivansh Ji was his guru. But, the fact of the matter is that Vyas Ji had attained such an extreme state of devotion where he had transcended his ego and attained his true self or God. With this sentiment he has called each devotee and saint his guru in the following doha. आदि, अंत अरु मध्य में, यह रसिकन की रीति। संत सबै गुरुदेव है, 'व्यासहि' यह परतीत॥ (Shri Vyas Vani, Saakhi 2, Pg. 408) Vyas Ji has used kind and respectful words to address all saints and devotees. But, he has dedicated many dohas to express his respect for Hith Harivansh Mahaprabhu as a Guru. Hence, it is often agreed that he was his Sadguru. However, his father is largely considered to be his initiating Guru (Diksha- Guru). Speaking about Krshna-Radha marriage: मोहन मोहिनी को दूलहु। मोहन की दुलहिनी मोहनी सखी निरखि निरखि किन फूलहु। सहज ब्याह उछाह ,सहज मण्डप ,सहज यमुना के कूलहू। सहज खवासिनि गावति नाचति सहज सगे समतूलहु॥ (Shri Vyas Vani, Pg. 362) Speaking about how he lived carefree by completely surrendering his life to God: काहू के बल भजन कौ ,काहू के आचार। व्यास भरोसे कुँवरि के ,सोवत पाँव पसार॥ (Shri Vyas Vani, Pg. 182) Speaking about how only devotion is the way to success in life: जो त्रिय होइ न हरि की दासी। कीजै कहा रूप गुण सुन्दर,नाहिंन श्याम उपासी॥ तौ दासी गणिका सम जानो दुष्ट राँड़ मसवासी। निसिदिन अपनों अंजन मंजन करत विषय की रासी॥ परमारथ स्वप्ने नहिं जानत अन्ध बंधी जम फाँसी। (Shri Vyas Vani, Pg. 84) Description of Spring Season in Vrindavan: चल चलहिं वृन्दावन वसन्त आयो। झूलत झूलन के झँवरा मारुत मकरन्द उड़ायो॥ मधुकर कोकिल कीर कोक मिलि कोलाहल उपजायो। नाचत स्याम बजावत गावत राधा राग जमायो॥ चौबा चंदन बूका बन्द्न लाल गुलाल उड़ायो। स्याम स्यामिनी की छवि निरखत रोम-रोम सचु पायो॥ (Vyas Vani, Pg. 415) Description of Monsoons in Vrindavan: आजु कछु कुंजन में वर्षा सी। बादल दल में देखि सखी री चमकति है चपला सी॥ नान्हीं नान्हीं बूंदनि कछु धुरवा से बहै सुखरासी। मंद मंद गरजनि सी सुनियत नाचती मोर सभा सी॥ इंद्रधनुष बग पंगत डोलति ,बोलति कोक-कला सी। इन्द्र वधू छवि छाइ रही ,मनु गिरि पर अरुन घटा सी॥ उमगि मही रूह सेमहि फूली भूली मृग माला सी। रटत व्यास चातक ज्यों रसना रस पीवत हूँ प्यासी॥ (Shri Vyas Vani, Pg. 392) Songs based on the literature written by Shri Hariram Vyas were written around 504 years ago. Legends One of the stories about Hariram Vyas was told by the court pandit of Orchha. Coming to Vrindavan, Swami Hariram Vyas found the association of Hit Harivams Goswami and fell in love with Vrindavan and Radha Krishna. He decided to give up material life and stay in the Dham and do bhajan and so sent word to the king of Orcha. The king implored him to return to do his worldly duties at the court. “What is better, acting for one’s own benefit or for the benefit of a great number of people in society?” The king challenged. “Is not your wish to remain in Vrindavan merely your own selfish desire?” Hariram Vyas accepted the king's logic, but his heart could not agree. He said, “You are right, but I will only go if my friend Hit Harivams Goswami, allows me to go, for it is from him that the desire to stay here has come.” His response to the king is mentioned in the following doha. वृंदावन के रूख हमारे माता पिता सुत बंधा। गुरु गोविंद साधुगति मति सुख, फल फूलन की गंधा इनहिं पीठि दै अनत डीठि करै सो अंधान में अंधा। व्यास इनहिं छोड़ै और छुड़ावै ताको परियो कंधा The king sent ministers to the Goswami and Harivans did indeed tell Hariram Vyas to tend to his worldly duties until they released him. This upset Hariram, who had become attached to his life of musical devotion, writing poetry and absorption in Radha and Krishna's name, forms and pastimes. Devastated, he began to prepare to leave the Dham. As one last act in the Dham, the tearful Hariram came to the Radha Vallabha temple that had already closed after the midday meal. There he saw a sweeper woman standing at the doorstep with a leaf plate of prasadam from Radha Vallabha. When Hariram saw her and the prasad, he immediately begged some of it from her, and she reluctantly ceded some of her touched food to the Brahmin. The minister and envoys from Orcha were there waiting for Hariram to finish his prayers and get on their way, but when they saw him taking food from an outcaste woman, they concluded that he had lost his caste, and returned without him. When Shri Hariram Vyas Ji felt that Kabirdas Ji has not been able to obtain Braj Ras. Although he was already Sidha Rasik Saint, and he often used to see the divine leelas of Yugal Sarkar, (but just to teach us a lesson that even a small Bhakta Apradh can almost destroy the complete sadhna of a sadhak) once he felt that “Kabir Das hardly understood the Braj Ras (Bliss of Braj)”. He cast aspersions on the integrity of Shree Kabir Das Ji and thought that Kabir Das has not been able to achieve the topmost bliss of Braj. As soon as he thought of this, he could no longer see the divine pastimes of Radha Krishna. Hit Harivansh Mahaprabhu concluded that Shri Krishna can never tolerate the offense towards his saints. Hari Ram Vyas Ji felt sorry and on the advice of his master \\"Hit Harivansh Mahaprabhu”, Vyas Ji wrote a few lines in praise of Kabirdas which are as such: \\"कलि में सांचो भक्त कबीर । जबते हरि चरणन रति उपजि, तब ते बुनयो न चीर । दियो लेत न जांचै कबहूँ, ऐसो मन को धीर । जोगी, जती, तपी, सन्यासी, मिटी ना मन की पीड़ । पाँच तत्त्व ते जन्म न पायो, काल न ग्रसो शरीर । व्यास भक्त को खेत जुलाहों, हरि करुणामय नीर ।\\" Vyas Ji saw in his visions that Kabir Das is manifesting from Yamuna Ji and Shri Krishna is following him and he again composed two lines which Shri Krishna himself composed of Kabir Das in his visions : \\"मन ऐसा निरमल भया जैसे गंगा नीर । पीछे-पीछे हरि फिरैं कहत कबीर-कबीर ॥ \\" Commentary on caste and social order Upper caste Hindus and Brahmins often take great pride in their caste and are particular about things like janeu (holy thread), but Vyas ji was free from these notions even though he was born in a highly respected rajguru brahmin family. Compared to true devotion (bhakti), he not only considered caste unimportant, but also a complete waste of time and energy. He advised people to drop the pride of caste and devote one's life in true bhakti. He held that a lower caste person who finds true devotion is far better than lakhs of Brahmins devoid of true devotion because while they are themselves asleep and lost, they claim to awaken and show the way to others. Vyas Ji didn't seem to care to know identity of fellow Hari-bhakts and freely took prasad from one and all. This is mentioned in one of the dohas written by him: स्वान प्रसादे छुइ गयो, कौआ गयो बिटारि। दोउ पावन 'व्यास' कें, कह भागोत बिचारि॥ 'व्यास' रसिक जन ते बड़े, ब्रज तजि अनत न जायँ। वृन्दावन के स्वपच लों, जूठनि मांगे खाय॥ 'व्यास' मिठाई विप्र की, तामें लागे आग। वृन्दावन की स्वपच की, जूठनि खेये माँग॥ By abandoning practice of untouchability and caste-divide Vyas Ji went against the social norms of his times and had to face wrath and disdain of many sections of the society. But he refused to be moved by such treatment. When people appealed that he respect the caste system and uphold the place of Brahmins he fearlessly said- 'व्यास'हिं ब्राह्मण जिन गनों, हरि-भक्तन कौ दास। राधावल्लभ कारनै, सहयों जगत उपहास॥26॥ जासों लोग अधर्म कहत हैं, सोई धर्म है मेरौ। लोग दहिने मारग लाग्यो, हौंब चलत हों डेरों।x जिनकी ये सब छोति करत हैं, तिनहि के हों चेरों॥230॥ Later life and death Vyas Ji continued to stay in Vrindavan for the remainder of his life and remained immersed in Radha Krishn bhakti and produced many . During his stay he also established Jugal Kishore temple. The temple was built with the help of Orchha king Madhukar Shah. The idols remained in the temple for many years but in order to protect the idols from a Mughal invasion, devotees shifted the idols to Panna. These idols are still placed in Old Jugal Kishore temple in Panna which is now in Madhya Pradesh. The exact year of his death is not known but Vyas Ji's samadhi sthal constructed by Orchha prince Veersingh Dev can still be found in Vrindavan.

It focuses on life events of Mary of Nazareth, Mother of Jesus, and Mary Magdalene.  Plot  In the beginning. We are introduced to Mary and her family, mother Ann and father Joachim. We immediately see how special she is and how God protects her even in the face of eminent danger. We feel the emotions that her parents must have felt as she was dedicated to the temple in service to the Lord. Throughout her life, there is constant element of childlike faith. Preserved by God Himself, we see Mary's faith in action, always succumbing to His will before her own. Compare and contrast. Through the movie, we see three women's lives and the effects of their choices – Mary of Nazareth, Mary Magdalene, and Herodias, daughter of Herod. We see both Mary's as friends in the beginning, but soon see the vast difference of journeys each takes. Our Lady, whose life is in complete service to God, and Magdalene, who seeks validation and self-worth through domination and lust. After a lifetime of debauchery, she shows up at Christ's feet like a war-torn soldier with nothing left to give. She uses what little energy she has left to completely surrender to Him after He challenges those without sin to cast the first stone in the face of what is certain death. Herodias, on the other hand, remains a cold and vindictive person whose heart is hardened by the very mention of Jesus. Her reaction to Christ parallels the hardness of heart we see in the pharaoh of Moses’ time. We see Magdalene reclaim her femininity by wearing modest apparel – we see this change in her demeanour and appearance go from a haggard, chewed up and spit out by society look to someone who suddenly has the glow of Christ and embodies the forgiveness we all crave as sinners. Shame and humiliation. Throughout Jesus’ life, we know that He accepted a life of worldly humiliation for the sake of paying our debt. We also know that He could have chosen not to feel the pain of the Cross, but freely chose to, out of love for us. Likewise, we see the shame and humiliation that Mary must have felt throughout her life. Although she always placed her trust and care in God's loving hands, the reality of her situation was, indeed, difficult – carrying a child out of wedlock, enduring the stares, silent and not-so silent gossip whenever she was around, the embarrassment the families faced on their wedding day, even when it seems as though Jesus publicly repudiates Mary. Each stage of her life, we see how Mary responds to the humiliation with perfect and total trust in God's plan. Humour and humanity. This movie delivers when it comes to humour. When Mary arrives to visit her cousin Elizabeth, Zechariah opens the door, but fails to answer Mary's greeting because of his own misgivings from months prior. We also see Joseph do what every father does when their child has come into the world – count toes! When the shepherds arrive to adore the Messiah, Mary is all too quick to hand over the Anointed One, but Joseph has a look of near panic on his face. It's easy to imagine what he must have been feeling as the one chosen by God to be a protector of both Mary and Jesus!

Anand Prasad under the Sudha Art Productions banner and directed by V. Jyoti Kumar. It stars Rajendra Prasad, Bhavana in the lead roles and music composed by M. M. Srilekha. The film was recorded as a flop at the box office. Plot Sundaram (Rajendra Prasad) is an unemployed guy in the village of Talamanchi, ruled by Seshadri Naidu (Ranganath), a feudal-era chieftain of his tribute. There is a Hindi lecturer post vacant in the college of Naidu and Sundaram wants that. Naidu is a glorified ruffian, and his protectiveness towards women actually makes it seem like a vice. He banishes people from the village for helping young lovers unite, makes college students start with an oath every day that all women are their sisters, pronounces the death sentence on men who attempt to outrage women, and generally makes himself look like some sort of extremist. Sundaram gets the job by some clever manipulation and then does the unthinkable; he starts wooing Sireesha (Bhavana), a very intelligent girl, the daughter of Naidu. He thinks that whoever woos her deserves her, and you lose your last shred of sympathy for Sundaram. Of course, Naidu finds out Sundaram's designs and issues him an ultimatum, that if in 15 days he cannot get Sirisha to say I Love You, he'll be dead. The remaining story is whether Sundaram will be successful in gaining Sirisha's love.

It was formed in 1879 from the territory of the Edo period Akashi Domain. The district ceased to exist on 10 January 1951, when its last remaining municipalities merged into Akashi city. The area that the district once covered is now within Akashi city and western Kobe city. History At the beginning of the Meiji era, the Akashi Domain consisted of the town of Akashi and 144 villages. In July 1871 the feudal system of domains and provinces was abolished and Akashi Domain became Akashi Prefecture. In November of the same year Akashi Prefecture merged into Himeji Prefecture, and a few days later it changed its name into Shikama Prefecture. In August 1876 Shikama merged into Hyogo Prefecture. On 8 January 1879 the national law on districts, wards, towns and villages was put into effect in Hyogo Prefecture and the district of Akashi was formed. The district's administration was located in Akashi town. When a new law on towns and villages came into effect in April 1889, the towns and villages of Akashi District underwent various mergers to form the following twelve towns and villages: * Akashi town * Hasetani village * Hayashizaki village * Hirano village * Ikawadani village * Iwaoka village * Kande village * Ōkubo village * Oshibedani village * Tamatsu village * Tarumi village * Uozumi village On 1 November 1919 Akashi town gained city status and broke away from the district, leaving the eleven villages. In the 1920s a series of changes to laws on local government saw districts in Japan lose their administrative powers, first by the dissolution of district councils in 1923, then the dissolution of district offices in 1926. At this time, districts remained only as a geographical area that was mainly used in the addressing of mail sent to towns and villages. In November 1928 Tarumi gained status as a town, followed by Ōkubo in April 1938. In July 1941 Tarumi merged into Kobe city, and Hayashizaki merged into Akashi in February 1942. In 1943 Tamatsu and Akashi submitted an application for a merger, but it was rejected. Instead, in March 1947 Tamatsu and six other villages (Hasetani, Hirano, Ikawadani, Kande and Oshibedani) merged into Kobe. On 10 January 1951, Ōkubo and Uozumi merged into Akashi city and the district ceased to exist, with all of its former towns and villages now within the cities Akashi and Kobe.

In the Talmud, the story is told after a discussion of being careful not to mistreat a person and the power of prayers which are said in pain to be heard by God. The story concerns a debate which was held over the halakhic status of a new type of oven. In the course of the rabbinic disagreement, the story expresses differing views of the nature of law and authority, concerns over a fractured and divisive community, and the issue of harming another person through words and actions.  Story  A new type of oven is brought before the Sanhedrin, consisting of tiles separated from one another by sand, but externally plastered over with cement. The rabbis debate whether or not this oven is susceptible to ritual impurity. Rabbi Eliezer ben Hurcanus argues that the oven is ritually pure while the other rabbis, including the nasi Rabban Gamaliel, argue that the oven is impure. When none of Rabbi Eliezer's arguments convince his colleagues, he cries out, \\"If the halakha is in accordance with my opinion, this carob tree will prove it.\\" At this point, the carob tree leaps from the ground and moves far away. The other rabbis explain that a carob tree offers no proof in a debate over law. Rabbi Eliezer cries out, \\"If the halakha is in accordance with my opinion, the stream will prove it.\\" The stream begins to flow backwards, but again the other rabbis point out that one does not cite a stream as proof in matters of law. Rabbi Eliezer cries out, \\"If the halakha is in accordance with my opinion, the walls of the study hall will prove it.\\" The walls of the study hall begin to fall, but are then scolded by Rabbi Joshua ben Hananiah who reprimands the walls for interfering in a debate among scholars. Out of respect for Rabbi Joshua, they do not continue to fall, but out of respect for Rabbi Eliezer, they do not return to their original places. In frustration, Rabbi Eliezer finally cries out, \\"If the halakha is in accordance with my opinion, Heaven will prove it.\\" From Heaven a voice is heard, saying, \\"Why are you differing with Rabbi Eliezer, as the halakha is in accordance with his opinion in every place that he expresses an opinion?\\" Rabbi Joshua responds, \\"It [the Torah] is not in heaven\\" (Deuteronomy 30:12). He responds in this way because the Torah, which was given by God to mankind at Sinai, specifically instructs those who follow it that they are to look to the received Torah as their source and guide. The Torah says, \\"It is not in heaven, that you should say, 'Who will go up to heaven for us, and get it for us so that we may hear it and observe it?' Neither is it beyond the sea, that you should say, 'Who will cross to the other side of the sea for us, and get it for us so that we may hear it and observe it?' No, the word is very near to you; it is in your mouth and in your heart for you to observe\\" (Deuteronomy 30:12-14). Rabbi Joshua's response then expresses the view that the work of law is a work of human activity, and that the Torah itself supports this legal theory. The Torah is not a document of mystery which must have its innate meaning revealed by a minority, but it is instead a document from which law must be created through the human activity of debate and consensus. Rabbinic literature was capable of recognizing differing opinions as having a degree of legitimacy (Yer. Ber. 3b), yet the community remains united and the ruling which is ultimately followed comes through proper jurisprudence. As such, Rabbi Eliezer's miraculous appeals represent a differing legal theory and were outside of proper jurisprudence which meant that they would not be followed. Instead the Jewish community followed the ruling of the majority in this issue and in others. The Talmud asks how God responded to this incident. We are told that upon hearing Rabbi Joshua's response, God smiled and stated, \\"My children have triumphed over Me; My children have triumphed over Me.\\" After this incident, the rabbis under Rabban Gamaliel choose to ostracize Rabbi Eliezer from their community. Rabbi Akiva, a student of Rabbi Eliezer, volunteers to bring this news to Rabbi Eliezer. Rabbi Akiva dresses himself in clothes of mourning, and he delicately says to Rabbi Eliezer, \\"My teacher, it appears to me that your colleagues are distancing themselves from you.\\" Rabbi Eliezer tears his clothes in mourning and begins to cry. It was said that Rabbi Eliezer had the power to destroy the whole world, yet due to the respectful manner in which he was ostracized, only a third of the world's crops were destroyed. When Rabbi Eliezer was given the news of being ostracized, Rabban Gamaliel was on a boat. A great storm picked up, and Rabban Gamaliel knew that this storm was retribution for the pain caused to Rabbi Eliezer. Rabban Gamaliel proclaims to God, \\"Master of the Universe, it is revealed and known before You that neither was it for my honor that I acted when ostracizing him, nor was it for the honor of the house of my father that I acted; rather, it was for Your honor, so that disputes will not proliferate in Israel.\\" When he spoke these words, the storm was calmed. Rabbi Eliezer continued to be in grief over being ostracized from the community. His wife, Ima Shalom (the sister of Rabban Gamaliel), was aware of the power that a prayer said in pain had to be heard. She attempted to interfere with her husband's supplication prayers so that any calls for retribution or bemoaning of his fate would not be heard. Yet one day she was distracted and failed to interfere with Rabbi Eliezer's prayers. At this moment, Rabban Gamaliel died. Rabbi Eliezer asked his wife how she knew that this would happen if he were to pray while in such pain. Ima Shalom explains the sentiment expressed in the discussion preceding the story of the Oven of Akhnai, she says, \\"This is the tradition that I received from the house of the father of my father: All the gates of Heaven are apt to be locked, except for the gates of prayer for victims of verbal mistreatment.\\" Interpretations There are many different themes in the story of the Oven of Akhnai. In the backdrop of the story is the status of Judaism prior to Rabban Gamaliel and the views that developed among the late Pharisaic or early Rabbinic Jews. During the Second Temple period there existed numerous forms of Judaism. Jewish factions during the Second Temple period harshly denounced one another and sometimes were violent towards each other. Following the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 CE, the Rabbis pondered why the destruction occurred. The Rabbis concluded that the Second Temple was destroyed due to \\"baseless hate\\" (Yoma 9b). In their retelling of the destruction, they point to divisions and a lack of empathy for one another. The Rabbis under Rabban Gamaliel sought to unify Judaism and end wanton sectarianism. Rabban Gamaliel's school recognized a degree of validity in varying statements, but chose to follow the more lenient philosophy of the school of Hillel. Jewish leaders like Rabban Gamaliel sought to create a cohesive Jewish community where major issues were settled, a system was in place to decide divisive issues, and minor issues could be tolerated. Rejection of this cooperation and an embrace of sectarianism was condemned in the strongest terms. Rabban Gamaliel himself was known to at times be too forceful in humiliating those who formed divisions. According to Vered Noam, Rabbi Eliezer sought to reveal an innate halakhah based on revelation and he did not accept proper jurisprudence. In contrast, Rabban Gamaliel and the other rabbis sought to create halakhah through human reason and utilizing proper jurisprudence. Rabbi Eliezer expresses a differing philosophy regarding halakhah and a rejection of following the jurisprudence upon which a cohesive community relies. The dispute is not simply over an oven, but this is a story which reflects two conflicting ideas over the nature of law and possibilities for destabilizing of the community. Rabbi Gamaliel expresses his concerns when calming the storm, stating that the reason for his heavy-handed action was \\"so that disputes will not proliferate in Israel,\\" the very same disputes which resulted in the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 CE. At the same time, the story is introduced solely on the basis of a discussion of being careful not to hurt another individual through verbal interactions. Rabban Gamaliel may have had the correct intentions and his philosophies which were necessary for sustaining his community may have won out, yet he still hurt his colleagues through his words and decisions. While much focus is placed on the accuracy of Rabban Gamaliel's position or Rabbi Joshua's statement, the story in the Talmud does not overlook the fact that Rabban Gamaliel's draconian measures may have gone too far. Scholar Jeffrey Rubenstein has argued that the Oven of Akhnai focuses on the fact that the majority need to take charge over the minority, but in a way that it is fair to all. The majority needs to work off the minority to attend the needs of everyone in the community. Yet, explains Rubenstein, the midrash says there is a limit to what the majority can do. People should not aim to cause someone to experience pain, but instead respect one another.  Influence  The Oven of Akhnai is one of the best known stories in the Talmud. As a result of the story, the phrase, \\"Lo Bashamayim Hi,\\" or, \\"Not in Heaven,\\" is well known among Jews. The phrase and story helps to reflect the Jewish view of law, the feasibility of following the Torah, and the importance of every generation to work to understand the Torah. The story of the Oven of Akhnai is also notable in being one of the stories where a woman is mentioned having learned Torah and expressing her understandings.

Sukardi was born in Jakarta into a family of the menak or Sundanese aristocracy. His father, Gandhi Sukardi (1929 - 2011), was a prominent journalist at the Antara state news agency. His grandfather, Raden Didi Sukardi (1898 - 1971), was also a journalist, plantation owner and government minister of the federal state of Pasundan. Laksamana Sukardi graduated as a civil engineer from the Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB) in 1979, but decided to pursue a career as an economist and banker. He eventually became part of the senior management of Bank Lippo, and was honoured as Banker of the Year from SWA Magazine in 1993. He also joined the reformist Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), and was an outspoken critic of the New Order regime of General Soeharto. His political career began with his election as a legislator in 1992 to the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR). He served in the legislature until 1997, before being appointed in October 1999 to the reformist coalition government of President Abdurrahman Wahid as Minister of State Owned Enterprises in the National Unity Cabinet. Sukardi held this position until April 2000, but was reappointed by the next Indonesian President, Megawati Sukarnoputri, to his old post in August 2001 as part of her Mutual Assistance Cabinet (2001 - 2004). As Minister of State Owned Enterprises, Laksamana Sukardi presided over one of the most significant programmes of privatisation and or sale of state- owned assets since Independence in 1945. After leaving office in 2004, Sukardi, together with other leading party bureaucrats such as Arifin Panigoro, led a revolt within the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle against party chairman and former president Megawati Sukarnoputri. In 2005, they founded their own Democratic Renewal Party. He has been questioned by the Attorney-General of Indonesia in a number of high-profile corruption cases since leaving office in 2004. WikiLeaks has also revealed the existence of a blanket gagging order applying to all citizens and media in Australia, issued by the Supreme Court of Victoria on June 19, 2014 for 'national security' reasons, which involves the names of several senior Asian politicians, including Sukardi.

Plot Six schoolmates, after the high school exams, decide to leave together for a holiday in the Dolomites, in what will probably be their last summer together before they probably never see each other again. The group consists of Enrico, the creator of the holiday and the group's glue; Max, a disabled boy suffocated by oppressive parents; Lorenzo, a musician who dreams the fame; Giulia, Lorenzo's girlfriend, reluctant to leave; Martina, the other girl in the group, secretly in love with Lorenzo; Cesare, an extravagant boy with a punk style and rough, but with a gold heart. The six during the stay in the mountains will learn to know themselves and others better, facing and trying to overcome their fears, binding even more between them. And together they will also overcome the tragedy - the death of Enrico during a climb - which troubles the adventure and loosens the bond around the group, so as to arrive united at the end of that summer, after which nothing will be never again as before.

Along with other Quechua weavers from Chinchero as well as international supporters, she helped to establish the Centro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cusco (Center for Traditional Textiles of Cusco) in 1996 as a non-profit organization. Since 1996 until the present day, Callañaupa has served as director of the Centro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cusco or CTTC. She has written two books on Peruvian Weaving, and has co- authored a third on weaving elders of the Peruvian Andes. Biography On her maternal side, Callañaupa's grandfather was Spanish and her grandmother was Quechua. After her grandfather passed away at an early age, her grandmother supported the family through making and selling textiles. Callañaupa's grandmother taught Callañaupa's mother, Guadelupe Alvarez, how to weave, who in turn taught her daughters. Callañaupa and other members of her family are often described as \\"master Quechua weavers\\" Callañaupa grew up in the 1960s in Chinchero, Peru. Her parents earned their living through agriculture. When Callañaupa was four, her mother began to bring her daughter with her to their chakra (fields) By the time she was six, Callañaupa was trusted to watch a flock of sheep alone. While tending her flock, Callañaupa befriended an elderly shepherdess, Doña Sebestiana, who was a highly skilled spinner. Callañaupa attributes her interest in textiles to Doña Sebastiana, whose work was so fine that young Callañaupa dreamt of spinning at night. From her mother Guadalupe, Callañaupa learned basic weaving designs. Her interest piqued, she also began studying textiles from other communities that her father brought home from his travels. When Edward and Christine Franquemont, a husband and wife pair of ethnobotanists from the USA, arrived in Chinchero in the 1970s to conduct investigations, Callañaupa befriended them and taught them the basics of weaving. With the encouragement and support of the Franquemonts, as well as other international supporters, Callañaupa eventually obtained a grant to study historical textiles in Berkeley, California where she experimented with different looms. Callañaupa holds a degree from the National University of San Antonio Abad in Cusco, 1986. She was one of the first women from her community to attend university, as during this time only men were expected to continue on to higher education. Nilda has taught internationally at museums and universities in the US and Canada, including Cornell University and the Smithsonian. In 1996 Nilda was one of the key founders of the Centro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cusco (Center for Traditional Textiles of Cusco or CTTC), a non-profit based in the city of Cusco. Since the 1970s a group of women weavers from Chinchero met informally to recover old designs and sell textiles in the tourist market, and in this way earn an independent income from their male relatives. Nilda was a leader of this group which met in the courtyard of her family's home. This informal group of weavers was the basis of the Centro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cusco which since 1996 has partnered with ten weaving communities in the region of Cusco to recover textile traditions and empower weavers. Since 1996 Callañaupa Alvarez has served as director of CTTC. Author Callañaupa Alvarez has written two books and co-authored a third. = Weaving in the Peruvian Highlands: Dreaming Patterns, Weaving Memories = Published in 2007 (available in Spanish or English), this book provides a general survey of textile traditions from nine communities of the Cusco region. Sections of the book include: traditional clothing, the weaving process, designs, textile traditions, and preserving traditions, in which detailed information is provided on the parts of the loom, dyeing plants (natural dye), and the significance of designs. = Textile Traditions of Chinchero: A Living Heritage = Published in 2012, this bi-lingual book takes a closer look at the weaving traditions of Callañaupa Alvarez's hometown of Chinchero. While her first book provides a cursory glimpse into various weaving communities, Textile Traditions of Chinchero delves deeper and explores in depth the many complex traditions of a single community. Sections of the book include historical information on Chinchero, traditional textiles and clothing, stages of textile production, Chinchero designs, and the impact of the Centro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cusco (Center for Traditional Textiles of Cusco). = Faces of Tradition: Weaving Elders of the Andes = Co-authored with Christine Franquemont. Published in 2013, this book features the photography of Joe Coca. Stylistically a cross between a photography book and biography, it tells the individual stories of weaving masters from various communities in the Cusco region. Divided into sections by community, each chapter begins with an introduction about the community and then explores the individual life histories of weaving elders through text and photo. Faces of Tradition was the Gold Award winner in the Multicultural division of the 2014 Benjamin Franklin Awards, which are recognized as one of the highest awards in the USA for independent publishers. Other In 2016 Alvarez was invited to TedWomen along with her sister Adela Callañaupa Alvarez, also a weaver from Chinchero, to present about the Centro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cusco.

Plot summary  In a dusty Queensland country town young Vinny Lalor is bullied by her fellow students at the local high-school. Her teacher, Helen Striebel, is the only one to show Vinny any support and when the teacher is involved in a scandal with a fellow male teacher, Vinny is again hurt. At the same time, teachers Mrs Striebel and English teacher Moller are beginning a tentative and careful love affair. In a country town, where rumour becomes truth, gossip is the primary conversation and small-minded meanness predominates, the two teachers, while understanding the place, do not anticipate fully the risks they are taking. Vinny, as an immature thirteen year old has a crush on her teacher Mrs Striebel. The relationship seems to be only thing of value in Vinny’s life. As a shy and unfriended child, Vinnys is shunned and misunderstood by the students and adults living in the town. Her life, as it is, is bearable, but when Vinny is kissed by a local boy after the school dance, girls in Vinny’s class seek to hurt Vinny in ways that have nothing to do with truth and everything to do with hurting the vulnerable Vinny and her teacher. The adult gossips have a field day ensuring the whole town hears of the scandalous behaviour of Mrs Striebel and Moller, who have fallen in love (despite the existence of Moller’s wife being terminally ill and living elsewhere). Mrs Striebel senses, rather than knows Vinny struggles with her life as defined by the town. Vinny’s lack of knowledge and her small town surroundings ensure she has no understanding about how life really should be. Despite the teachers endeavours to keep their love affair private, a group of students from Vinny’s school decide to ‘stick the knife in’, putting lewd and suggestive comments in public places around the town and in the school. In this period of Australian history, small-minded malevolent behaviour is the norm. The teachers find themselves maligned at every turn and have no avenue of appeal to truth and common sense. Within a short while, the head master of the school decided to move Mrs Striebel to another school. In its worst form, this speaks of the male ‘sowing his wild oats’ as the woman is cast as a tart. Vinny finds herself to be the only person in the town who wants to protect Mrs Striebel. Thea Astley has written a sensitive and intense study of the cruel pettiness of a small town country community as it is experienced by Vinny, Helen Striebel and English teacher Moller. The dusty Queensland tropical background and the small town meanness, so well described, is significant to the main themes of desired love and a lack of intellectual stimulas. It effects every aspect of the town and the lives of the people but specifically, in this novel, anyone who is different or who speaks out in any way. The main characters are marginalised in every possible way. It is a compelling read. Critical reception Joyce Halstead in The Australian Women's Weekly was impressed: \\"This gifted writer has drawn with a scholar's touch a sensitive and intense study in human emotions played out against the cruel pettiness of a small town community. The dusty Queensland tropical background, so well described, is significant, but remains unobtrusively incidental to the main theme. An excellent and important new novel.\\"\\"Your Bookshelf\\" by Joyce Halstead, The Australian Women's Weekly, 25 May 1960, p53 Television adaptation In 1983 a television mini-series based on the book was released.

Biography Einoris was born in Urnėniškis village in what is now Kupiškis District, Lithuania, on 7 February 1930. Einoris was one of 12 children in a peasant family. From 1948 Einoris studied and worked in the agricultural sector of the Lithuanian SSR, starting of as an agricultural technician, zootechnician, later becoming the head of a collective farm, before joining the agricultural administration apparatus as a deputy in the Biržai district executive committee in 1959.

Described by his former coach Steve Kean as having \\"fantastic physical attributes\\", he is one of Brunei's most important footballing prospects, having made his national team debut at the age of 17. Club career Yura is a graduate of local grassroots football development scheme Projek Ikan Pusu (PIP) that has won many youth tournaments since its creation in 2001. He had a stint in the Bruneian leagues in 2012, lacing up for BIBD SRC in the Brunei National Football League, the precursor to the first season of the Brunei Super League. Yura joined Majra FC for the 2014 season. His Majra career ended just 9 matches into the season after his club abruptly pulled out of the ongoing league. Yura was selected to join Brunei's sole professional club DPMM FC at the start of 2015, alongside Khairul Anwar Abdul Rahim, Reduan Petara and Aminuddin Zakwan Tahir. He made 9 appearances for DPMM in the 2015 S.League, mostly as a substitute. From the beginning of the 2016 season, Yura was converted into a central defender by Steve Kean partly due to the departure of Boris Raspudić and also to give him more playing time. Yura scored his first goal for DPMM on 5 August 2016 at home against Albirex Niigata (S), a last-minute winner against the expatriate Japanese side. After three fruitful seasons under Kean, new Brazilian coach Renê Weber preferred to play a returning Abdul Aziz Tamit instead, restricting Yura to just eight appearances in the 2018 season. Nevertheless, under Adrian Pennock the following year, Yura managed to regain his starting place alongside Charlie Clough and Nurikhwan Othman in a back three formation. DPMM would then record the joint best defensive record of the league, emerging as champions by the time the league ended in September. International career Yura regularly appeared for Brunei at under-19, under-21 and under-23 levels even before his senior international debut in 2014. His first international tournament was the September 2013 AFF U-19 Youth Championship held in Indonesia where he started all of Brunei U19's five matches. Two months later, he joined the SEA Games contingent of Brunei for its 27th edition in Myanmar. He started the second and third games against Malaysia and Singapore respectively as Brunei U23 lost all their games in the football tournament. Yura's next tournament was the 2014 AFC U-19 Championship qualification with the under-19s. Brunei placed bottom with three losses in their qualifying group that included North Korea, Thailand and Singapore. He was in the 2014 Hassanal Bolkiah Trophy squad for the defense of the Hassanal Bolkiah Trophy which Brunei U21 won in 2012 and played three games out of five. Yura was selected for the Skuad Tabuan to compete in the 2014 AFF Suzuki Cup qualifying matches held in Laos on October 2014. With the team composed largely of Brunei DPMM FC players and led by its head coach Steve Kean, his future club coach started Yura for the crucial game against Myanmar in which they fell to a score of 1–3. Yura kept his place for the final game against Cambodia, losing 0–1. Yura was back with the U23s in 2015 for the 2016 AFC U-23 Championship qualification held in March of that year and also the 28th SEA Games in Singapore. He played 6 games in total, losing in every game. Yura played for the national team at the 2016 AFF Suzuki Cup qualification matches held in Cambodia in October 2016, playing at centre-back to cover for Reduan Petara who was ruled out with injury. He was sent off in the 88th minute for a professional foul on Tith Dina in the second fixture, a 0–3 loss against hosts Cambodia. Yura was called back to the under-21 side for the 2018 Hassanal Bolkiah Trophy held in April and May, as an overage player as he was a few months over the age limit. Playing in central defence for the tournament, he scored a last-minute winner against Thailand in the second match. Yura was one of 13 DPMM FC players to link up with the Brunei national team in early September 2018 for the AFF Suzuki Cup qualification matches of that year, against Timor-Leste. He was deployed by Kwon Oh-son in central midfield in the first leg which finished 3–1 to Timor-Leste. A reshuffling of tactics in the second leg saw Yura put on a commanding display at centre-back and resulted in a 1–0 shutout in favour of Brunei. Nevertheless, Brunei failed to advance to the Suzuki Cup group stage with a 2–3 aggregate loss. Yura accepted a callup to the national team to face Mongolia home and away at the 2022 World Cup qualification held in June 2019. He was played in central midfield since several of his teammates pulled out of the Brunei selection. Brunei lost the first leg 2-0 away from Bandar Seri Begawan and managed to win 2-1 for the return leg, but nevertheless another repeat aggregate defeat sent the Wasps out of both the 2022 World Cup and the 2023 Asian Cup.

It stands above the River Lahn in the eponymous parish in the county of Limburg-Weilburg in the German state of Hesse.  Location  The hill castle stands about 50 metres above the Lahn on a projecting hillside in the parish of Schadeck that was named after it within the borough of the small Hessian town of Runkel. The castle is about six kilometres east of Limburg and 60 kilometres northwest of Frankfurt.  History  Because of inheritance and ownership disputes, Schadeck was built by Henry of Westerburg from 1276 to 1288 as a counter-castle to Runkel Castle, which at that time was owned by a cousin. The name of the castle and its surrounding settlement came from its purpose eine Ecke zum Schaden der Burg Runkel (\\"a spot from which to damage Runkel Castle\\"). However, Runkel Castle was never conquered. On 21 July 1321, an agreement was signed that forced the then Lord Reynard of Westerburg to hand over Runkel Castle as a fief to the Archbishop of Trier, Baldwin of Luxembourg. This was preceded by violent conflicts between the two parties later. However, the agreement was not carried out, so Baldwin captured the castle in 1344. The seizure of the castle was related to attempts by Baldwin to protect and expand his estates east of the Rhine. The disputes over Schadeck must have continued because, in 1346, another agreement was signed that provided for a division of the castle. In the same year, however, Reynard of Westerburg sold his entire share to the Archbishop. Apparently the Westerburgs remained as vassals of Baldwin at the castle. During the Thirty Years' War, and again in 1803, parts of the castle, especially the north wing, were slighted. From the early 19th century the ownership of the castle changed hands several times. It was also divided between several owners. From 1821, the west wing housed the mayor's office of the municipality of Schadeck and, in about 1850, the village school was located on the second floor. In the 20th century, the structural condition of the castle deteriorated rapidly, so that parts of the castle threatened to collapse. In 1998 extensive renovation work began, in particular the complete replacement of the roof and the framework of the baroque staircase. This work was completed in 2006.  Description  The most important component of the present castle site is a well-preserved, three-and-a-half storey, rectangular building, which has a staircase tower on the western side. This contains private residences, which means that it is not possible to view the interior of Schadeck Castle. Of the remaining buildings only a few remains and foundation walls have survived. In addition to being a listed building, the castle is also protected in the event of war under the Hague Convention.

He has taught at the Free University of Berlin, among other institutions, and held fellowships in the German departments of Columbia University and Yale University. His work on Speculative realism and Accelerationism in art and philosophy has found a wide audience beyond academia.  Life  Of Armenian descent, born 1973 in Vienna, Armen Avanessian studied philosophy and political science under Jacques Rancière in Paris. He completed his dissertation, 'Phenomenology of Ironic Spirit: Ethics, Poetics, and Politics in Modernity' , under the supervision of conservative theorist Karl Heinz Bohrer at the University of Bielefeld. For several years, he worked as a free-lance journalist, journal editor (Le Philosophoire, Paris), and in the publishing industry in London. From 2007 to 2014, he taught in the Peter Szondi Institute for Comparative Literature at the Free University of Berlin. In 2011 he was a Visiting Fellow in the German Department at Columbia University and in 2012 in the German Department at Yale University. Since 2013, he has held visiting appointments at a number of art schools (in Nuremberg, Vienna, Basel, Copenhagen, California). In 2014, he became the chief editor at Merve Verlag, a Berlin publisher specializing in philosophy and political theory. In 2011, Armen Avanessian founded the bilingual research and publication platform Speculative Poetics that brings together philosophers, writers, and artists from across the world around the idea of a new theoretical discipline in the making.  Career  Following his dissertation, which had already explored phenomena at the intersection of art, politics, and philosophy, Avanessian focused on developing a new approach in literary theory and philosophy of language. Collaborating with colleagues such as Anke Hennig, he began working in 2011 on connecting new speculative- ontological approaches with twentieth-century philosophies of language, which resulted most notably in two co-written books, 'Present Tense: A Poetics' (2012, English translation 2015) and 'Metanoia: A Speculative Ontology of Language, Thinking, and the Brain' (2014, English translation forthcoming 2016). Moreover, he played a central role in bringing accelerationism into German-language political philosophy. In 2015, Wired Magazine named him an intellectual innovator, noting in particular his concern with post-capitalist ideas. Avanessian's work has come to be situated primarily outside the academy. It includes widely discussed statements on current affairs such as the refugee crisis, numerous lectures in the international art and culture scene, as well as a large number of interviews and intellectual portraits. Beyond the classical academic mainstream, Avanessian has repeatedly managed to introduce new concepts and theoretical constellations into public discourse. These consist partly of neologisms, partly of concepts used in smaller circles, which Avanessian's work as editor re-produces for the German-language context. Examples include \\"speculative realism\\", \\"acceleration\\", \\"xenofeminism\\", \\"hyperstition\\", and, most recently, the concept of the \\"time complex: postcontemporary\\". Hyperstition, moreover, is not just another concept, it also designates a method, namely the actualization in the present, from out of the future, of ideas or fictions. Avanessian's books have been translated into several languages, including English, Russian, Dutch, Spanish, and French.  Literary Studies  Avanessian's early publications are mostly scholarly books and essays on linguistics, semantics, and literary studies. His philosophical breakthrough came with the edited volumes on 'Speculative Realism' (Realism Now) and the German edition of the reader, '#Acceleration'. His move to Merve has emphasized his focus on editing current, not yet established philosophy, treating, in particular, questions in feminism, finance theory, and technology. He has also published books discussing the possibility of poeticizing philosophy. His book 'Overwrite: Ethics of Knowledge, Poetics of Existence' (2015, English translation forthcoming) confronts the deplorable state of academia in an explicitly accelerationist way. Not limiting himself to mere criticism, Avanessian is constantly at work constructing alternative platforms such as the summer school he organized with Reza Negarestani and Pete Wolfendale at the Haus der Kulturen der Welt, Berlin, on \\"Emancipation as Navigation: From the Space of Reasons to the Space of Freedoms.\\"  Art  Avanessian can also be considered a postcontemporary artist. He uses not only classical publication formats but also art festivals and exhibitions. The 2015 gallery festival \\"Tomorrow Today / curated by_vienna\\" for example, was based on Avanessian's homonymous essay and combined the work of twenty curators with the idea of an actual post- capitalism. Within the framework of the ninth Berlin Biennale, Avanessian conducted a ten-day Young Curators Workshop on alternatives to the economic and political models of contemporary art. Avanessian is a regular contributor to art journals such as Spike, Texte zur Kunst, and DIS Magazine. He also writes frequently about art in philosophical contexts. For several years now, Avanessian has collaborated with the graphic artist, Andreas Töpfer, which has led to publications in print (with Merve and Sternberg Press) and on film.  Radio  With columnist Georg Diez, media theorist Paul Feigelfeld, and author Julia Zange, Armen Avanessian hosts \\"60 Hertz\\", a talk show airing every Monday on Berlin Community Radio. The show is conceived as an artistic rendering, in interviews and conversations, of everyday life in the 2010s. Episodes are usually broadcast in a mix of English and German language.  Film  With Berlin director Christopher Roth, he has produced the film Hyperstition (2016), which draws on ontology, science fiction, and sociology to question the concept of time. Screened at several festivals in Europe and the United States, the film consists of conversations with established as well as younger philosophers such as Nick Srnicek, Elie Ayache, Ray Brassier and others.

Inscriptions are one of the most important classes of primary evidence that comes down to us from antiquity. Tracy is best known for devising a method for recognizing the work of individual inscribers. It was long thought that the intractability of the medium (hammer and chisel on marble) made this impossible. But by treating the inscribed letters as a kind of handwriting he has been able to establish careers for many cutters, to join discrete fragments, to date inscriptions more accurately than in the past, and often thereby make it possible to reach a new understanding of historical events. Education and career * Tracy received his BA in Classics from Brown University in 1963 and PhD in Classical Philology from Harvard University in 1968. * He was an instructor and assistant professor Wellesley College, 1965–71, and professor of Greek and Latin at Ohio State University, 1971-2002. From 2002 until 2007 Tracy was director of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens. He has had a long association with the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton: member in 1987-88, 90 and 91, Mellon Fellow 1996-97, and long-term visitor from 2007 to 2016. He is currently a visiting associate at the Institute. * He was the creator and first director of the Center for Epigraphic and Paleographic Studies at The Ohio State University.

Her death helped prompt legal changes to improve the rights of farmers. Early age Bakhtawar was born in 1880 in the village of Dodo Khan Sarkani, near Roshan Abad, Taluka Tando Bago, Badin District, Sindh, in what was then British India. She was the only child of Murad Khan Lashari. In 1898, Bakhtawar married Wali Mohammad, a peasant working on the Ahmadi Estate. The couple had four children: Mohammad Khan, Lal Bukhsh, Mohammad Siddique and daughter Rasti. Movement for peasants' rights Before the Partition of India, the agricultural population in Sindh was divided in two classes. The landlords owned lands that had been awarded to them by the Hindu Raj as political bribes, The peasants worked the land, receiving a small reward for their labors. At the time of yield, the landlords would seize most of the yield, leaving a small amount of crop to the farmers. Bakhtawar's village was the property of an Ahmadi who owned forty thousand acres of land, known as the “Ahmadi Estate”. An agrarian activist, Hyder Bux Jatoi, called for a conference of farmers to demand that they receive a half share of the yield. The Hari Conference in started in Judho on 22 June 1947.https://www.thenews.com.pk/tns/detail/659187-mai-bakhtawar-a-forgotten- daughter-of-sindh Close to ten thousand farmers and workers went to conference, including all the men in Dodo Khan Sarkani. Confrontation On 22 June 1949, the last day of the Hari conference, the Ahmadi Muslims decided to seize 1,20,000 kilograms of flour from Dodo Khan Sarkani while the village men were still absent. When the Ahmadi Muslims and their men arrived at the village, they were confronted by Bakhtawar, an old disabled man and other women. The villagers asked the Ahmadi Muslims to wait on taking the flour until the village men returned from the conference. In a rage, Choudhry Saeedullah and his manager Choudhry Khalid ordered one their men to shoot Mai Bakhtawar was killed instantly . Her body was taken to town Samaro for postmortem rites and buried there. Success after death In 1950, a law was passed by the Government of Pakistan that forced landlords to have of the yield to the farmers. Saeedullah, the nephew of then Pakistani foreign minister Muhammad Zafarullah Khan, and Khalid were sentenced to 20 years of imprisonment for killing of Mai Bakhtwar by Court.

The resolution originated through a debate initiated by the Permanent Representative of Rwanda by sending a letter dated 3 July addressed to the Secretary-General. The 15 member body emphasised that concrete steps should be taken by United Nations and regional organisations (especially the African Union) to strengthen their relationships and develop more effective partnership. The resolution reaffirms support for African Union and European Union collaboration with peacekeeping operations.  Observations  Acting under Chapter VIII of the UN Charter, the Security Council (SC) reaffirmed its previous resolutions 1809(2008), 2033(2012) and 2086 (2013). It reiterated the need for cooperation between UN and regional organizations due to various reasons, such as- * Pertinent role of such organizations in post- conflict peace-building in a region; * Ability of regional organizations to understand the root causes of armed conflicts owing to their knowledge of the region, which can be a benefit for their efforts to influence the prevention or resolution of such conflicts.  Acts  The Security Council stressed upon the utility of developing effective partnerships with regional/sub-regional organizations. This partnership is important as local entities can respond to disputes and emerging crises much quicker than the UN, thereby preventing or at least mitigating the potentially negative consequences. The SC also asked regional organizations to accelerate the work on establishment of 'Standby Arrangements System' for conflict prevention and peace keeping. The Council also called upon the Secretary-General to coordinate with and support the African Union Commission in its development of a list of needed capacities and recommendations on ways the African Union can further develop its military, police, technical, logistic and administrative capabilities.

The adult insect is slender, about long, with a red thorax and dark brown wings marked with a yellow cross. It is native to the southeast of the United States, Jamaica and Puerto Rico. It is a pest of cotton crops and other plants, the adults and older nymphs feeding on the emerging bolls and the ripening seeds. Description The adult Dysdercus suturellus is about long. It has a red head with black antennae, the first segment of which are longer than the second. The thorax has a white pronotal collar and is otherwise mostly red. The sternites of the abdomen are red, bordered with white posteriorly. The corium, the leathery base of the wings, is dark brown margined with cream, giving the insect a large cross-shaped pattern. Distribution and hosts Dysdercus suturellus is native to the southeasternmost part of the United States, Jamaica and Puerto Rico. It is a pest of cotton crops and its distribution has been linked to the area of cotton under cultivation. Other host plants include tangerines, okra, papaya, oleander, roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa), rose of Sharon (Hibiscus syriacus), Turk's cap mallow, teaweed (Sida sp.), Caesarweed (Urena lobata), Spanish needles (Bidens pilosa), Portia tree (Thespesia populnea), rose, eggplant, black nightshade (Solanum nigrum) and guava. The host plants are all in the families Malvaceae, Sterculiaceae, Bombacaceae and Tiliaceae. Life cycle Dysdercus suturellus is a true bug and does not undergo metamorphosis. The eggs are pale yellow and are laid singly or in small groups in sand, leaf or plant debris, and hatch in about a week. The nymphs pass through five instars (developmental stages) over the course of three to five weeks. The first instar lives underground after which the nymph climbs the host plant. The nymphs are largely red but in the fourth and fifth instars, the dark wingpads are apparent as they enlarge, and the abdominal segments develop pale margins and become more obvious. There are several generations each year. Biology The adults and late stage nymphs feed on the protein-rich seeds of their host plants. As these become available at different times of year, the winged adults migrate between different plant species. The adults have also been observed predating the larvae of the cotton leafworm (Alabama argillacea) and the larvae and pupae of the yellow scallop moth (Anomis erosa). They also feed on the nectar of many species of flowers and on various fruits, including citrus. When these insects feed on cotton bolls, the young bolls fail to mature, and the lint becomes stained which reduces the value of the crop. When they feed on citrus, they plunge their rostrum (beak-like mouthparts) deep into the fruit which may then fall a few hours later, or decay internally over the next few days.

It is in the Hassan district in the Indian state of Karnataka. Location The fort is located away from the Sakaleshpura town to its south west, which is on the right bank of the Hemavati River, from Hassan on the National Highway 75 that runs from Bangalore to Mangalore. Sakaleshpura is the headquarters of Manjiraba taluk and is a municipality. Since the fort is located on a hill at an elevation of , it gives a clear and commanding view of the surroundings. On a clear day, even Arabian sea can also be seen from the fort. History Tipu Sultan built the fort in 1792 at a time when he was establishing his sovereignty over Mysore, fighting against the native Indians. At this time even the Marathas and the Nizam of Hyderabad had aligned with the British. The Sultan wanted to make the highway between Mangalore and Coorg secure for his expansion programmes. Because he was allied with the French at that time against the British, he sought the help of French engineers to build a star fort of the european style. The completed fort was inspected by Tipu Sultan who then found it enveloped in fog and hence named it as Manjarabad fort; the name Manjara is a corrupted version of 'manju' meaning \\"fog or mist\\" in Kannada. Features The fort, as built and existing, is an eight-pointed star. The external walls of the fort have been built with granite stones and lime mortar while the interior buildings, which accommodate army barracks, armoury, stores and others, have been built with fired bricks. Apart from these, two cellars were built next to a deep well which were underground structures used to store gunpowder, and these rooms remained cool even during summer months. The fort has sloping walls. It is said that the fort is \\"the most complete Vaubanesque star-shaped fort in India\\". Tourism is not well developed in the area. The Tourism Department of Karnataka, pressed by demands from local people of Sakaleshpura, have plans to create basic amenities around the fort and also develop a park.
