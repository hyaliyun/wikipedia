Among the company's regular customers are RAI and Mediaset, the two major Italian broadcasters. He has defined and implemented a strategy that allows Albatross to develop its projects in-house, participating in the financing and consequently retaining ownership over most of the rights and formats, thus confirming Albatross as Independent Producer. The productions by Alessandro Jacchia have received acclaim from both the public and critics along with awards in some of the most prestigious international television festivals, including the FIPA (Festival International de Programmes Audiovisuels) in Biarritz, the Monte-Carlo Television Festival, Banff World Media Festival in Canada, the Shanghai International Film Festival, the Roma Fiction Festival. He is the author of film stories, screenplays for film and TV Dramas, also made by other producers, such as \\"Mollo Tutto,\\" \\"Lourdes\\", and the format creator of TV series as \\"Don Matteo\\" and \\" The Restorer\\". From 2001 to 2007 he was Professor at University of Urbino, where he taught \\"Economics and Organization of Performing Arts\\" at the Faculty of Sociology, Communications Studies. Currently, he holds a yearly course entitled \\"What is an idea?\\" at Luiss (Libera Università Internazionale degli Studi Sociali Guido Carli - University of Rome and at University of Rome La Sapienza. In July 2002 he received the Award for Best European Television Producer as part of the 42nd Monte-Carlo Television Festival.

The NSA has built an infrastructure which enables it to covertly hack into computers on a mass scale by using automated systems that reduce the level of human oversight in the process. As quoted by The Intercept, TURBINE is designed to \\"allow the current implant network to scale to large size (millions of implants) by creating a system that does automated control implants by groups instead of individually.\\" The NSA has shared many of its files on the use of implants with its counterparts in the so-called Five Eyes surveillance alliance – the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia. Among other things due to TURBINE and its control over the implants the NSA is capable of: * breaking into targeted computers and to siphoning out data from foreign Internet and phone networks * infecting a target's computer and exfiltrating files from a hard drive * covertly recording audio from a computer's microphone and taking snapshots with its webcam * launching cyberattacks by corrupting and disrupting file downloads or denying access to websites * exfiltrating data from removable flash drives that connect to an infected computer The TURBINE implants are linked to, and relies upon, a large network of clandestine surveillance \\"sensors\\" that the NSA has installed at locations across the world, including the agency's headquarters in Maryland (Fort George G. Meade) and eavesdropping bases used by the agency in Misawa, Japan (Misawa Air Base) and Menwith Hill, England (RAF Menwith Hill). Codenamed as TURMOIL, the sensors operate as a sort of high-tech surveillance dragnet, monitoring packets of data as they are sent across the Internet. When TURBINE implants exfiltrate data from infected computer systems, the TURMOIL sensors automatically identify the data and return it to the NSA for analysis. And when targets are communicating, the TURMOIL system can be used to send alerts or \\"tips\\" to TURBINE, enabling the initiation of a malware attack. To identify surveillance targets, the NSA uses a series of data \\"selectors\\" as they flow across Internet cables. These selectors can include email addresses, IP addresses, or the unique \\"cookies\\" containing a username or other identifying information that are sent to a user's computer by websites such as Google, Facebook, Hotmail, Yahoo, and Twitter, unique Google advertising cookies that track browsing habits, unique encryption key fingerprints that can be traced to a specific user, and computer IDs that are sent across the Internet when a Windows computer crashes or updates.

It was last assigned to the Central Flying Training Command, and was disbanded on 30 June 1945 at the San Antonio Aviation Cadet Center, Texas. The wing was a World War II unit for the classification and preflight testing of aviation cadets. It was one of three such centers, the others being at Maxwell Field, Alabama and Santa Ana Army Air Base, California. There is no lineage between the current United States Air Force 78th Air Base Wing, established on 24 September 1948 at Hamilton Air Force Base, California, and this organization.

This was the stage where it would be decided whether the cadet would train as a navigator, bombardier, or pilot. * Pre-Flight Stage taught the mechanics and physics of flight and required the cadets to pass courses in mathematics and the hard sciences. Then the cadets were taught to apply their knowledge practically by teaching them aeronautics, deflection shooting, and thinking in three dimensions. Once the cadet successfully completed the training at the center, they would be assigned to one of the AAF primary flight schools for initial flying training. = Lineage= * Established as 78th Flying Training Wing on 14 August 1943 : Activated on 25 August 1943 : Disbanded on 30 June 1945 78th Flying Training Wing, lineage and history document Air Force Historical Agency, Maxwell AFB, Alabama =Assignments= * Army Air Forces Central Flying Training Command, 25 August 1943 – 30 June 1945 =Units= * Army Air Forces Classification Center, 30 April 1942 – 1 May 1944 : 885th Classification Center Squadron, 4 July 1942 : 886th Classification Center Squadron, 4 July 1942 : 888th Classification Center Squadron, 4 July 1942 Squadrons re-designated as squadrons \\"E\\", \\"F\\", \\"G\\", 2535th AAFBU, 1 May 1944Mueller, Robert (1989).

It was released on January 25, 1995 via Nothing Records, Nine Inch Nails founder Trent Reznor's vanity label and a subdivision of Interscope Records. The album was produced by Warne Livesey and Reznor, who also engineered on four tracks. The album sold 66,000 copies. The tracks \\"Communiqué\\"/\\"Crack\\" and \\"Animal\\" were released as singles. \\"Animal\\" became a minor alternative radio hit and was accompanied by a music video. A follow-up album, The Wreckard, was released independently in 2002 after it was rejected by Interscope Records due to creative differences and the band was unsigned from the label. In 2017, the album was reissued on vinyl through Trent Reznor's Null Corporation label and made available for digital download via the ITunes Store. Background and recording In 1992, Kevin McMahon started an unnamed project after his previous new wave band Lucky Pierre disbanded. He recorded four demo songs with Trent Reznor, a longtime friend and a former Lucky Pierre member who founded Nine Inch Nails. These songs were recorded in Reznor's Le Pig studio and in New Orleans. The title track from Lucky Pierre's 1988 Communiqué EP, which featured Reznor on backing vocals, was also re- recorded as a demo. After Reznor fully committed himself to the recording of Nine Inch Nails' second studio album, The Downward Spiral, McMahon went to England and collaborated with British producer Warne Livesey to finish the album. Meanwhile, he assembled a line-up for his band, which featured guitarist Chris Schleyer and drummer Andy Kubiszewski, who was known for fronting Exotic Birds. McMahon recorded eight songs with them and six of these tracks appeared on the album. The band signed to Nothing Records of Interscope, a vanity label founded by Reznor and former Lucky Pierre manager John Malm Jr.. After the contract was sold to Nothing Records, Reznor and McMahon considered re-recording their previous demos. Nevertheless, the demo tracks were eventually kept in the album, due to lack of time and delays in the project. Critical reception Bradley Torreano of Allmusic gave the album a positive review, describing it as \\"a blustering, angry album that works despite its tendencies to drag.\\" He also added: \\"Although the album as a whole does have moments where McMahon gets overbearing, this is a record that never quite got its due upon its original release and deserves a second chance.\\" Track listing All songs written by Kevin McMahon. # \\"Communiqué\\" – 4:04 # \\"Riverhead\\" – 4:39 # \\"Tough\\" – 3:57 # \\"Other People\\" – 3:20 # \\"No Fair Fights\\" – 4:56 # \\"Animal\\" – 4:10 # \\"I Got It Bad\\" – 3:46 # \\"I Apologise\\" – 2:48 # \\"Crack\\" – 4:35 # \\"Makebelieve\\" – 6:48 Personnel ;Prick *Kevin McMahon – vocals, guitar, bass, programming, drums *Chris Schleyer – guitar *Andy Kubiszewski – drums ;Technical personnel *Trent Reznor – production (1, 3–5); engineering (1, 3-5) *Warne Livesey – production (2, 6-10) *Richard Norris – engineering, recording (2, 6-10) *Tom Baker - mastering *Alan Moulder - mixing *Adrian Harrow – assistant engineering *Brian Liesegang – assistant engineering *Chris Vrenna – assistant engineering *Darren Allison – assistant engineering *Lorraine Francis – assistant engineering *Matt Howe – assistant engineering *Shelley Saunders – assistant engineering *Steve Bush – assistant engineering (2) *Tracii Sherman – assistant engineering ;Other personnel *Roger Von Golling – artwork *Gary Talpas – artwork, sleeve coordination References External links * Category:1995 debut albums Category:Nothing Records albums Category:Albums produced by Trent Reznor Category:Interscope Records albums Category:Prick (band) albums ","title":"Prick (Prick album)"},{"id":"42183937","text":"The 2014 East Harlem gas explosion occurred at 9:31 a.m. on March 12, 2014, in the East Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City. The explosion leveled two apartment buildings located just north of 116th Street at 1644 and 1646 Park Avenue, killing eight people, injuring at least 70 others, and displacing 100 families. City officials initially pointed to a gas leak as the cause of the blast. In June 2015, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) blamed the explosion on failures by Consolidated Edison and the city.McGeehan, Patrick. \\"Con Edison and New York City Are Faulted in East Harlem Explosion\\" The New York Times (June 9, 2015) Background The two collapsed buildings were five stories tall and stood at approximately . Together, the two buildings contained 15 residential apartment units. 1644 Park Avenue had the \\"Spanish Christian Church\\" on the ground floor, while 1646 Park Avenue had a piano store occupying that space. Utility company Consolidated Edison said it received a gas leak call 15 minutes prior to the explosion and had sent its two crews to the spot; however, they arrived after the explosion. The United States National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) - which has responsibility at the Federal government level for investigating accidents involving pipelines and the transportation of hazardous materials\\"Office of Railroad, Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Investigations\\" National Transportation Safety Board website - said that natural gas was found in nearby soil in varying concentration. NTSB Board member Robert Sumwalt also revealed that the gas main buried under Park Avenue near the scene at 116th Street dated back 127 years, to 1887. The explosion Bricks, wood, and other debris landed on the adjacent elevated Metro-North Railroad tracks, suspending service to and from Manhattan for most of the day while crews cleaned up the mess. Service was restored by the evening rush. In on-the-fly television interviews, witnesses described feeling the force of the blast from blocks away, including entire buildings shaking as though it were an earthquake, and it furthermore blew out windows in adjacent properties.Firefighters battling the flames. Morning television shows on the major city networks were preempted in favor of nonstop news coverage of the explosion and its aftermath. The New York City Fire Department (FDNY) and the New York City Police Department responded to the scene after the explosion within two minutes. Two fire companies, quartered in an FDNY firehouse located approximately five blocks to the south, reported hearing and feeling the effects of the massive explosion and alerted the department's dispatch office. Within a short amount of time, the incident escalated to a five-alarm fire, bringing over 250 firefighters to the scene. The American Red Cross in Greater New York was on the scene and helping those displaced, but otherwise not requiring emergency medical services, using nearby Public School 57 as a makeshift center before MTA buses transported them to a Salvation Army shelter at 125th Street.Red Cross Helping Residents Displaced By East Harlem Blast – WCBS The NTSB was investigating the scene.East Harlem Explosion: 4 more bodies found; Firefighters battle hotspots – WABC = Victims = The fatalities in the explosion and collapse included eight people.

Aftermath The NTSB, which is responsible for investigating gas-related incidents, reported on June 9, 2015\\"New York City, NY/Pipeline Explosion and Fire in Manhattan; March 12, 2014\\" National Transportation Safety Board (June 9, 2015) that faulty welding of two Con Edison gas pipes was primarily responsible for the explosion, but that it might not have happened at all if New York City had repaired a large hole in a nearby sewer main which it had known about for 8 years. The hole in the sewer undermined the soil beneath the gas pipes, causing them to sag and then crack open. Thus it was the combination of the two circumstances which caused the disaster. The NTSB also faulted local residents who did not report the odor of leaking gas, which began at least a day before the explosion, and Con Edison's failure to notify the New York City Fire Department immediately once the leak had been reported to the company. Con Edison sued New York City, and the office of Mayor Bill de Blasio rejected the NTSB's finding of fault on the city's part, saying that the effects of sewer leakage was \\"localized\\" and did not cause the gas pipes to break.Chung, Jen. \\"Con Ed & NYC's Shoddy Infrastructure Work Caused East Harlem Building Explosion, Report Finds\\" Gothamist (June 10, 2015) The utility's suit, filed in June 2015, blamed the gas explosion on neglect by the city. Con Edison said the city was notified on multiple occasions about depressions on the street pavement. In November 2015, an investigation by the New York Public Service Commission accused Con Edison of 11 violations of gas-safety regulations. The PSC found that the utility did not correctly install a gas pipe, and failed to notify the Fire Department after two reports of gas odors. The report said that undermining of a gas line by a neglected city sewer line was a contributing factor. In February 2017, Con Edison agreed to pay $153 million to settle the PSC charges. It was described by New York governor Andrew Cuomo as the largest payment for a gas safety incident in the state's history. The settlement will largely go to gas safety education, repairs of pipes prone to gas leaks, and costs incurred by residents and businesses as a result of the explosion. The utility did not admit wrongdoing.

The Works of M.Yu. Lermontov in 4 volumes. Khudozhestvennaya Literatura Publishers. Moscow, 1958. Vol. 2. Pp. 519–522. Belonging to the so called \\"Ironic cycle\\" (alongside \\"The Fairytale for Children\\" and \\"Tambov Treasurer's Wife\\"), it is one of Lermontov's largest poems, containing 149 stanzas (11 lines each, written partly in dactylic pentameter, partly in modified Ottava rima format). The poem, with its sharp criticism of the contemporary Russian society, marked a radical detour from Lermontov's earlier romantic verses. Critics see it as a pivotal point in Lermontov's development as a realist and as a huge step from earlier, mostly derivative works towards his masterpiece A Hero of Our Time. Synopsis Sashka, whom the author refers to as his \\"best friend\\", makes his way to a house at Presnya, a brothel-type place, where he makes love to his beau, a Jewish girl Tizra. Fascinated by the story of a high society party he's just been to, the latter suggests that her lover takes her to one, introducing her as a rich noble girl. He agrees. As Sashka falls asleep, the narrator relates his life story, some details of which correspond with those of Lermontov (the French governor's characteristics were later reproduced in some biographies). Upon awakening, the young man goes home, receives financial aid from his aunt and gives money with some instructions (the nature of which remains unknown) to his black servant who also appears to be his friend. History For the first time, fragments of the poem (verses: 1–3, 5, 12–14, 27–28, 32, 45) were published by Pyotr Yefremov in Bibliograficheskye Zapiski (Bibliographical Notes, No. 18, 1861). These belonged to the so-called \\"Chicherin notebook\\" - a collection of verses and sketches written by Lermontov before his first exile and belonging to B.N. Chicherin. Judging by the first verses of this original rough copy, the author's initial intention was to write about his own adventures (\\"Sure, my predecessors' paths are slippery / And yet I'm eager to publish my own tale\\"). Having changed his mind, Lermontov re-worked Verses 1–4 and made his \\"best friend\\" the poem's central figure. Both versions relate to one particular plotline, concerning the \\"house in Presnya\\" where Tirza and several other women abide. Another one, dealing with Sashka's childhood, youth, his first love, has been worked upon in another notebook of Lermontov, the so-called \\"Geography lectures\\", dated 1835. In the final 1836 version both stories got merged. Pavel Viskovatov, who published Sashka in 1882, received the manuscript from Penza literary collector, merchant I.A.Panafutin whose father was a land-surveyor at Lermontov's relative P.P.Shan-Girey's estate. This original manuscript got lost but, judging by the quality of the Russkaya Mysl, publication was seriously flawed and full of misspellings; Viskovatov re-written fragments that he found either unreadable or unsuitable for publication. Some cuts were made by censors. In 1887, N.N. Bukovsky, the keeper of Lermontov Museum in the Saint Petersburg Junkers College, came up with a checked-up, revised version which was later used in Abramovich's The Complete Lermontov (1914, 1916) and in the 1939 Academia publication. There has been a lasting controversy as to whether Sashka was a finished work or just the first chapter of a larger poem. Originally, nine verses of the unfinished \\"Chapter 2\\" were added by Viskovatov to the original text. Boris Eichenbaum was the first to suggested them to be the beginning of another poem, and since then it has been agreed that Sashka was a complete piece of work, Verse 149 being its last. =Date controversy= The poem was written in 1835–1836. Pavel Viskovatov in his \\"Biography\\" quotes Lermontov's relative A.P. Shan-Girey's words: \\"It was then [in January-February, 1836] that Lermontov in Tarkhany started the poem \\"Sashka\\", based upon disparate sketches he'd made earlier.\\" Certain details of the plot also point to that particular period. \\"One of these days we are awaiting the Comet / That brings the end to all the world\\", - these two lines must be relating to the Halley's Comet which had been expected to arrive on November 13, 1835. Another one, \\"Naples gets frozen, and Neva won't melt\\" proved to be not that definitive. An Academia Publishers editor in 1939 found it a good reason to change the date to 1839, a year when the winter was particularly severe. Several years later critic M.F.Nikoleva pointed to the fact that the spring of 1835 was also exceptionally cold. Another fact that confused literary historians was that Verses 2-4 and 137-139 of \\"Sashka\\" have found their way into another Lermontov poem, \\"In Memory of A.I.Odoyevsky\\", written in 1839. As the poet's vast legacy has been systematized in the 20th century, it was established that recycling lines in this manner was the common practice with Lermontov (\\"In Memory of A.I.Odoyevsky\\" also featured a fragment from 1832 poem \\"He was born for happiness, for hopes...\\"). Legacy Critics see Sashka as an important point in Lermontov's evolution from a purveyor of 'Byronic' romanticism to a social realist. According to the Lermontov Encyclopedia, the poem's most obvious predecessors were Byron's Don Juan and Beppo, but it was also continuing the Russian tradition of A Dangerous Neighbour by Vasily Pushkin, Sashka by Alexander Polezhayev and Alexander Pushkin's Yevgeny Onegin and The House in Kolomna.

The early part of her career was spent patrolling the Pacific coast of the United States and the Bering Sea. After 1931 she did patrol work off Florida and in the Caribbean. After Unalga was sold in 1946, she was renamed after Jewish Agency leader Haim Arlosoroff and used for six months for moving Jewish refugees from Europe to Palestine before being forced to run aground by British Navy ships near Haifa. History =U.S. Revenue Cutter Service= Reporting for her first assignment USRC Unalga, a cutter built for the Revenue Cutter Service by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Corporation, was authorized June 1911 and launched on 10 February 1912. After leaving the shipyard in convoy with USRC Apache, she arrived at Baltimore, Maryland 27 April and was placed in commission by the Revenue Cutter Service at its depot at Arundel Cove, Maryland on 23 May 1912. After spending the summer outfitting at the USRC Depot, Washington Navy Yard and Newport News Shipbuilding, she received orders to report to the RCS Northern Division at Port Townsend, Washington on 6 September 1912. Departing Norfolk, Virginia on 26 September, Unalga arrived at Port Said, Egypt on 1 November after making stops at ports of call at Gibraltar, Naples, Italy and Malta. While preparing to transit the Suez Canal, she received orders to report to US Ambassador William Woodville Rockhill at Constantinople. Rockhill directed that Unalga remain in the area to protect Americans in Turkey during the Italo-Turkish War in Libya. She departed Port Said on 17 December, the same day a peace conference was convened in London to settle differences between the Ottoman Empire and the Balkan League. After stops at Aden, Ceylon, Singapore, Manila, Yokohama, and Honolulu, Unalga reported to the Commander, RCS Northern Division at Port Townsend on 22 March 1913, which in turn assigned her to the Bering Sea Patrol. Bering Sea Patrol The first patrol Unalga sailed lasted from 3 May until 11 August when she returned to Port Townsend. On 21 September Unalga departed Port Townsend for a new assignment with the RCS Southern Division headquartered at San Francisco arriving for patrol duties on 25 September. She served with the Southern Division until detached on 25 March 1914. She was at Oakland for repairs for the first twenty days of April and left for duty in Alaska following completion of the repairs. For the next three years Unalga rotated between assignments in Alaska and Port Townsend and added the duty of enforcing the Neutrality Act when World War I started in Europe on 1 August 1914. =U.S. Coast Guard= Alaska patrols On 28 January 1915 USRC Unalga became USCGC Unalga by virtue of the establishment of the United States Coast Guard by merger of the United States Revenue Cutter Service with the United States Life-Saving Service.U.S. Coast Guard General Order No. 1 In February 1915 additional duties were assigned enforcing the North Pacific Fur Seal Convention of 1911 which related to prohibited pelagic sealing in the Bering Sea.Kroll, p 92 Patrol work during 1915 and 1916 consisted of summers in Alaskan waters with sealing treaty duties, law enforcement, search and rescue, medical assistance to fishermen and others, and the delivery of mail to remote camps. Winters were spent at various locations along the Pacific Northwest coast doing law enforcement patrol work. In January 1917, Unalga was assigned her first winter patrol in Alaskan waters at the urging of representatives of the fishing industry to provide medical services to crews of fishing vessels as well as search and rescue work in remote waters. She stopped in Sitka, Alaska to investigate reports of a measles epidemic and to take on more coal for her first winter mission into the Gulf of Alaska. Unalga's first winter patrol was begun 30 January during a squall with hurricane force winds that iced the cutter over and threaten to sink her with the additional weight. After the starboard whaleboat was smashed by heavy seas and the radio masts snapped from the weight of ice, Captain Frederick Dodge made for the shelter of Yakutat Bay. The cutter was listing starboard at twenty degrees and the crew had to clear ice from the decks and machinery with axes and steam hoses. The crew of Unalga spent the next week repairing damage to the cutter while the surgeon treated the ills of inhabitants of Yakutat and gave the resident missionary a short course in medicine. Each time the cutter would leave the shelter of the bay another gale would appear, but Dodge took care to seek shelter before the cutter was as severely iced as the first time. Unalga was recalled to Seattle on 6 March after steaming 3000 miles, boarding 342 vessels, having given medical aid to 19 individuals of whom three were fishermen.Johnson, pp 37-38 =U.S. Navy and World War I= On 6 April 1917 the United States declared war on the \\"Imperial German Government\\" and the Coast Guard was placed under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Navy for the duration of the war by executive order signed by President Woodrow Wilson.Johnson, p 43Larzelere, p 7 Duties for Unalga did not change under Navy control initially and she left for her usual summer patrol work in Alaskan waters on 4 May. At the end of the summer cruise, she was assigned submarine tender duties with the Twelfth Naval District and home- ported at San Pedro, California, arriving 17 October. On 6 May 1918 she left Seattle for her usual Alaska patrol work, but in late May the captain was notified by radio to report to Unalaska to assist with an influenza epidemic. The crew tended eighty sick persons, distributed food, made coffins and buried the dead. In mid-June Unalga steamed to Bristol Bay and up the Nushagak River to Dillingham, Alaska providing medical services to the ill and burial details for the dead.Strobridge and Noble, p 183 By the end of June the epidemic had abated and Unalga resumed patrol work in the Gulf of Alaska.Johnson, pp 70-71 She returned to San Pedro and submarine tender duties on 17 October 1918.Larzelere, p 95 On 11 November 1918 the armistice ending World War I was concluded but Navy control of the Coast Guard did not end until 28 August 1919 when President Wilson signed an order returning the Coast Guard to Treasury Department control.Kroll, p 130 =Return to the Coast Guard= Patrol work in Alaska Unalga's schedule of summers in Alaska and winter assignments with the Northern Division continued unchanged after the Treasury Department resumed control of the Coast Guard. Duties performed included search and rescue, fisheries patrols, treaty enforcement, delivery of supplies and mail to remote areas, transport of officials and prisoners, medical care, and law enforcement. A portion of each winter in the years 1922 to 1926 was spent on maintenance availabilities and repair work to the cutter. In February 1927, Unalga arrived at Winslow, Washington for a six-week overhaul, leaving 15 April for regular patrol duties in Alaska. On 4 November 1927, she collided with the 15- or 18-gross register ton motor vessel Eurus in Dixon Harbor () in Southeast Alaskaalaskashipwreck.com Alaska Shipwrecks (E) – where she had towed Eurus after Eurus′s engine broke down in Cross Sound in the Alexander Archipelago near Cape Spencer – while trying to get a new towline to Eurus after the original towline parted; Eurus sank 20 minutes later, and Unalga rescued her crew of two. On 27 June 1930, Unalga received orders to report to the Coast Guard Depot at Curtis Bay, Maryland for extensive repairs. Decommissioning Unalga departed Seattle bound for Maryland on 26 July 1930 and arrived at the depot on 5 September. She was placed out of commission on 16 February 1931 and moved to the Philadelphia Navy Yard for repair on 18 February. Repairs at the Navy repair facility were completed and she left Philadelphia for Curtis Bay on 27 June where additional work was completed. Unalga was again placed in commission 23 April 1932. Port Everglades and the Navy On 14 May 1932, Unalga left the Curtis Bay depot bound for her assignment at Port Everglades, Florida and she arrived on 24 May for patrol duties. On 7 September 1933 she left Port Everglades for Key West, Florida after being assigned to the Navy Special Service Squadron to be used to patrol the Florida Straits during a series of revolts that eventually put Fulgencio Batista in power in Cuba. Unalga responded along with cutters , , and ; all stationed in Southern or Gulf ports.Johnson, p 133 The Navy returned her to the Coast Guard on 1 November 1933 after the troubles in Cuba ended and she returned to patrol work at Port Everglades. She served in the Port Everglades area until 1935 when she was transferred to San Juan, Puerto Rico. During this time Unalga provided rescue service to the stricken Pan American clipper ship, Dominican Clipper, NC15376. As reported in the Boston Globe, Unalga rescued 15 of the 27 passengers when the clipper crashed on landing in San Juan harbor on 3 October 1941.Two Babies Missing..., Boston Globe-Herald Shortly after she transferred to San Juan, Unalga was the oldest cruising cutter in the Coast Guard inventory.Johnson, p 153 =U.S. Navy and World War II= Unalga served as a patrol cutter for the Coast Guard at San Juan performing law enforcement duties until 1 November 1941 when President Franklin D. Roosevelt transferred by executive order the whole Coast Guard to the control of the Department of the Navy. The Navy assigned her to anti-submarine patrols operating out of San Juan. In September 1943, Unalga was assigned to the Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Training Center at Melville, Rhode Island where she served as a \\"target ship\\" for PT boats and then recovered the test torpedoes. In June 1945, she was relieved of those duties and assigned to the 5th Naval District at Norfolk, Virginia where she assumed patrol work. =Immigration ship= Haim Arlosoroff (right) aground off Bat Galim, Palestine in 1947 On 10 October 1945 the U.S. Navy decommissioned Unalga and turned her over to the War Shipping Administration. On 19 July 1946 she was sold and renamed Ulua. She participated in the immigration of Jewish refugees to Palestine. On 24 January 1947 Haganah renamed her Haim Arlosoroff after the assassinated leader of the Jewish Agency. The ship embarked on a voyage that carried 1,378 Jewish refugees in Sweden and Italy bound for Palestine. It was intercepted by the Royal Navy destroyer and ran aground at Bat Galim, Haifa on 27 February 1947. The crew and passengers, some of whom were injured, were arrested and deported to Cyprus. =Notes= =Citations= =Bibliography=     Further reading  External links * Category:1912 ships Category:Jewish immigrant ships Category:Ships built in Newport News, Virginia Category:Ships of the United States Revenue Cutter Service Category:Ships of the United States Coast Guard Category:Steamships of the United States ","title":"USCGC Unalga (WPG-53)"},{"id":"42183966","title":"Taavi Rõivas"},{"id":"42183973","text":"Sir John Gibson (1841–1915) was a journalist who spent most of his career at Aberystwyth as editor of the Cambrian News. His book, The Emancipation of Women, dealt particularly with Wales. Early life A portrait from the Welsh Portrait Collection at the National Library of Wales. Depicted person: John Gibson – English editor and journalist Gibson was born in Lancaster on 14 February 1841, the son of a hatter named John Gibson. His mother, Dorothy Gradwell, had worked in a cotton mill prior to her marriage and appears to have returned to the mills after the death of John Gibson, snr. Around 1863 he joined the Oswestry Advertiser as a printer and began to write for the paper. For the next ten years he appears to have worked as a journalist in various places in Wales and the English border counties. Influence In September 1873, he became the manager and editor of the Cambrian News at Aberystwyth. The newspaper had been established in the wake of the 1868 general elections, and its early editions had focused on allegations of evictions made in Wales at the time of those elections. In 1880, a consortium assembled by Gibson purchased the Cambrian News, and for the next thirty years it became one of the most influential weekly papers in Wales. This owed much to Gibson's personality and independent views. As a by-product of his newspaper, his book, The Emancipation of Women, appeared in 1891 and was reissued in 1894. Gibson remarked in the book's first chapter that \\"the laws of this country still treat women as the inferiors of men – as mere slave stuff. It can never be said that the work of political and social reform is finished until women are not only politically enfranchised, but are able to take their seats in both Houses of Parliament, and to hold even the highest positions in governments, trades and professions.\\" The feminist Lady Florence Dixie enclosed The Emancipation of Women in an open letter to Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone and other major political figures, passionately criticizing their male-supremacist assumptions and opposition to women's suffrage and commending Gibson as a \\"true man and real - not sham - Liberal\\"; the letter was published in the suffragist newspaper The Woman's Herald in April 1892. Gibson was also a supporter of the atheist and secularist Charles Bradlaugh.  Personality  Thomas Jones, who was a student at University College Wales, Aberystwyth in the 1890s, described Gibson as \\"...a stranger in an alien and narrow community, unhappy in his domestic life, lonely, and despite his large physical frame, highly sensitive. He made few friends and many enemies\\". Appreciation Gibson was knighted in 1915, but died on 16 July in the same year.

Her body was exhumed in 1980, 2000, and 2013 in efforts to identify her and her killer; to date, these efforts have been unsuccessful. Discovery The body of the victim upon her discovery On July 26, 1974, a 9-year-old girl walking her dog found the decomposing body of an unidentified woman in the Race Point Dunes of Provincetown, Massachusetts. The remains were just yards away from a road, and had a significant amount of insect activity. Two sets of footprints led to the body, and tire tracks were found from the scene. The woman may have died two weeks before her body was found. The victim was laid face-down on half of a beach blanket. There was no sign of a struggle; police theorized she either knew her killer or had been asleep when she died. A blue bandanna and pair of Wrangler jeans were under her head. She had long auburn or red hair, pulled back into a ponytail with a gold-flecked elastic band. Her toenails were painted pink. Police determined the woman was approximately tall (initially believed to have been 5'8\\"), weighed , and had an athletic build. She also had dental work – including crowns – worth $5,000-$10,000; dentists call it the \\"New York style\\" of dental work. Several of her teeth had been removed. Both hands and one forearm were missing. Most sources say she was between 25 and 40 years old. However, she could have been as young as 20 or as old as 49. The woman was nearly decapitated, possibly from strangulation; one side of her head had been crushed with (possibly) a military-type entrenching tool. This head injury was what killed her. There were also signs of sexual assault, likely postmortem. Some investigators feel the missing teeth, hands, and forearm indicate the killer wanted to hide either the victim's identity or their own. The woman was buried in October 1974 after the case went cold. In 2014, one of the case investigators raised funds for a new casket, because the original thin metal casket was rusted and deteriorated. Investigation Other depictions of the victim, created between 1979 and 2006 Police pored through thousands of missing-person cases and a list of approved vehicles driven through the area; no matches were found. At the scene, the sand and beach blanket were not disturbed, suggesting that the body was possibly moved to that specific spot where her body was found. No other evidence was found (besides the jeans, bandanna, blanket and ponytail holder) despite extensive searches of the surrounding dunes. The first facial reconstruction of the woman was created with clay in 1979. Her remains were exhumed in 1980 for examination; no new clues were uncovered (although the skull was not buried at the time). The body was exhumed again in March 2000 for DNA. In May 2010, her skull was placed through a CT scanner that generated images that were then used by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children for another reconstruction. =Leads= In 1987, a Canadian woman told a friend that she saw her father strangle a woman in Massachusetts around 1972. Police attempted to locate the woman but were unsuccessful. Another woman told police the reconstruction of the victim looked like her sister, who disappeared in Boston in 1974. Investigators also followed a lead involving missing criminal Rory Gene Kesinger, who would have been 25 years old at the time of the murder (she broke out of jail in 1973). Authorities saw a resemblance between Kesinger and the victim. However, DNA from Kesinger's mother did not match the victim. Two other missing women, Francis Ewalt of Montana and Vicke Lamberton of Massachusetts, have also been ruled out. =Jaws film extra possibility= In August 2015, speculation arose that Lady of the Dunes may have been an extra in the 1975 film Jaws, which had been shot on Martha's Vineyard (specifically the village of Menemsha), about south of Provincetown, between May and October 1974. Joe Hill, the son of horror author Stephen King, brought this to police attention after reading The Skeleton Crew: How Amateur Sleuths are Solving America's Coldest Cases just weeks before. While watching the film's Fourth of July beach scene, Hill spotted a woman in the crowd wearing a blue bandana and jeans, similar to those found with the body. Although a lead investigator has noted interest in this lead, others have described it as \\"far-fetched\\" and \\"wild speculation.\\" Suspects Bulger's mugshot at Alcatraz (1959; age 30). Additional reconstruction, depicting the victim with and without freckles In 1981, investigators learned a woman who resembled the victim was seen with mobster Whitey Bulger around the time the woman presumably died. Bulger was known for removing his victims' teeth. A link to Bulger has not been proven, and he was murdered in prison in 2018. Tony Costa, a serial killer in the area, was an initial suspect, but later eliminated. Costa died on May 12, 1974.Radford University The victim was found in July 1974. =Hadden Clark confession= Serial killer Hadden Clark confessed to the murder, stating \\"I could have told the police what her name was, but after they beat the shit out of me, I wasn't going to tell them shit. ... This murder is still unsolved and what the police are looking for is in my grandfather's garden.\\" Authorities say Clark suffers from paranoid schizophrenia, a condition which may lead someone to confess falsely to crimes. In 2004, Clark sent a letter to a friend stating that he had killed a woman on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. He also sent two drawings: one of a handless, naked woman sprawled on her stomach, and another of a map pointing to where the body was found. In April 2000, Clark led police to a spot where he claimed he had buried two victims 20 years before. He also stated that he had murdered several others in various states between the 1970s and the 1990s.

TechRadar's Jonas Muro wrote in 2018 that two reasons among others made Vertcoin \\"popula[r]\\".

NBC News's Ben Popken noted in 2018 that Vertcoin has received significant attention on reddit and that its \\"soaring popularity over the last year\\" is owing to its being impervious to the specialized machines known as ASICs which are similarly being used to have heavy influence over Bitcoin. Though a December 2018 paper published in The Transactions of the Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers said that \\"because [Vertcoin] is not a very popular blockchain, the difficulty adjustment algorithm is very sensitive to hashrate change, making it an easy target to timestamp spoofing and cherry picking attack.\\" From October through December 2018, Vertcoin suffered from 51% attacks.

Founded by Reiulf Ramstad, the firm has a permanent staff of 16. Reiulf Ramstad is internationally known for their work in Norway, with clients like Husbanken and Oslo Sporveier. RRA’s designs range from private residential to large civic works, such as schools, restaurants, public transit stations, museums, and tourist routes. Using biomimetic and natural materials, the firm's main goal is to create unique buildings derived from logical thinking and decision- making. RRA is affiliated with the Association of Norwegian Architects. History In 1995, Reiulf Ramstad graduated from the Venice School of Architecture and founded Reiulf Ramstad Arkitekter AS firm. In its first 15 years, RRA participated in some 35 open architectural design competitions, often placing first prize. Competition designs included hotels, shopping centers, museums, colleges, and other civic centers. Among constructed prize works are the firm’s 2004 proposal for the Metro Oslo Carl Berner, and the 1998 Customs Administration and Office Building at the Gardermoen National Airport. RRA has also worked on small-scale housing projects, such as the 2002 Villa Drammen. Reiulf Ramstad Arkitekter has gained considerable attention after the 2012 completion of the Trollstigen National Tourist Route project, now one of Norway’s most visited tourist destinations. Since then, RRA has won numerous awards and recognitions, including the 2012 Norwegian Concrete Award and two nominations for the Mies van der Rohe Award. Currently, the firm has 27 employees, including a permanent staff of graduate architects, one managing director, 2 administrative staff, and 2–4 permanent openings for architectural students. Reiulf Ramstad is RRA founder and Design Director, since January 2017 he his accompanied by 3 Associated Partners. Practice Reiulf Ramstad Arkitekter sets out to create contemporary architecture based on careful analysis and planning, taking account of the location of each project while combining research with an innovative approach. Rather than employing typical problem-solving methods, the firm frequently develops its own solutions. =Style= Influenced by architects like Carlo Scarpa and Sverre Fehn, RRA’s style has been classified as revitalized Nordic. In order to break away from traditional Nordic architecture, RRA draws on natural materials to create different views of nature for users. The firm seeks to establish a new style of Nordic architecture and new ways of experiencing natural areas in their projects. =Design integration= Taking a multidisciplinary approach centred on architecture, the firm also undertakes landscaping work, such as their 2012 cemetery grounds proposal for the Trondheim Church Council, and interior design including furniture. In 2002, the firm won the Museum of Decorative Arts and Design’s competition for the permanent exhibition, “Design and Craft 1905–2005”, covering the history of arts and crafts in Norway. RRA’s furniture designs, such as their wooden chairs, have been displayed in national and international exhibitions. Projects =Trollstigen National Tourist Route= Trollstigen Visitor Center One of Reiulf Ramstad Arkitekters better known projects rests on the Trollstigen plateau and is part of the National Tourist Route. Completed in 2012, the project was the winner of a 2004 competition held by the Norwegian Public Roads Administration. The structures take up approximately 20,000 square feet on their 2 million square foot landscape, also designed by RRA. They are composed mainly of treated, cast-in- place concrete and corten steel. Although the area can accumulate up to 23 feet of snow, the structures are highly stress-resistant, yet slender. The Tourist Route has been recognized for its environmental design, using durable, sustainable, and locally-sourced materials. The project is now one of Norway’s most popular attractions. =Other notable works= Fagerborg Kindergarten * 2017: Miami Sweet Bird South (under construction) – Miami, USA * 2017: Gjøvik University College (under construction)- Gjøvik, Norway * 2016: Romsdal Folk Museum – Molde, Norway * 2016: Norwegian Mountaineering Center – Åndalsnes, Norway * 2015: V10 Apartments – Oslo, Norway * 2015: Cultural Center Stjørdal (Kimen) – Stjørdal, Nord-Trondelag, Norway * 2014: Knarvik Community Church – Knarvik, Hordaland, Norway * 2012: Recycling Plant ISI – Baerum, Oslo, Norway * 2012: Trollstigen Visitor Center – Møre og Romsdal, Norway * 2012: Selvika National Tourist Route – Finnmark, Norway * 2011: Trollwall Restaurant and Service – Trollveggen, Møre og Romsdal, Norway * 2011: Summer House – Fuglevik, Norway * 2011: Havsdalen Holiday Home – Havsdalen, Geilo, Norway * 2010: Havøysund National Tourist Route – Havøysund, Finnmark, Norway * 2010: Fagerbørg Kindergarten – Fagerbørg, Oslo, Norway * 2010: Korsgata 5 Urban Apartments – Grünerløkka, Norway * 2008: Villa Heshtagen Asker – Oslo, Norway * 2006: Østfold University College – Østfold, Norway * 2006: Inside-Out Cabin – Papper, Hvaler Islands * 2004: Villa on a Slope – Oslo, Norway * 2003: Villa Holmenkollen – Holmenkollen, Oslo, Norway Reception Reiulf Ramstad Arkitekter has frequently received positive reviews for its work on many different types of buildings and has been mentioned in national and global magazines.

Club career Burleigh was born in Willington, County Durham, and played for the local club, Willington A.F.C., before turning professional with Newcastle United in 1968. Burleigh was an International youth cup winner in 1969 Newcastle defeating Arsenal in the final of the tournament which was held in Rotterdam having already won the Northern Intermediate league and cup double that same season. He played with a Newcastle first XI in Barrie Thomas's testimonial match on 26 November 1968. He made his first-team debut on 26 December 1970, in a 3–0 defeat away to Leeds United in the First Division. Despite conceding three goals on his debut Burleigh gained praise from Leeds manager Don Revie \\"I thought he had a fine game he had no chance with the goals some of the saves he made showed he has a fine future ahead of him\\". He was on the substitute's bench for United's 1970/71 European campaign. Burleigh had to wait over a year before making another first team appearance his home debut on 8 January 1972 in a 4–2 victory over Coventry City. An injury to undisputed first-choice goalkeeper Iam McFaul in February 1973 allowed Burleigh a run of games in the first team, but the run ended when he broke a finger, after a clash with Mick Channon in a 1–1 draw away to Southampton and he played only twice more playing his final game for Newcastle on 11 May 1974 against Tottenham Hotspur at St James Park.

It has been estimated by Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) that up to 257,000 women were victims of gender related violence during the war. The majority of assaults were carried out by the Revolutionary United Front (RUF). The Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC), The Civil Defence Forces (CDF), and the Sierra Leone Army (SLA) have also been implicated in sexual violence. Multiple perpetrator rape (MPR) was widespread during the conflict, with one report showing that seventy-six percent of survivors had been subjected to MPR. There were high levels of survivors having caught a sexually transmitted disease, and six percent reported that they had been forcibly impregnated. Human Rights Watch (HRW) said of the gender related violence that it had been \\"widespread and systematic\\". War crimes trials began in 2006, with thirteen people indicted for gender related violence, and for the first time, forced marriage was found by the trial chamber to be a crime against humanity.  Rape as genocide  According to Amnesty International, the use of rape during times of war is not a by-product of conflicts but a planned and deliberate military strategy. Since the end of the 20th century, the majority of conflicts have shifted from wars between nation states to communal and intrastate civil wars. During these conflicts the use of rape as a weapon against the civilian population by state and non-state actors has become more frequent. Journalists and human rights organisations have documented campaigns of genocidal rape during the conflicts in, the Balkans, Sierra Leone, Rwanda, Liberia, Sudan, Uganda, and in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The strategic aim of these mass rapes are twofold, the first is to instil terror in the civilian population, with the intent to forcibly dislocate them from their property. The second, to degrade the chance of possible return and reconstitution by having inflicted humiliation and shame on the targeted population. These effects are strategically important for non-state actors, as it is necessary for them to remove the targeted population from the land. Rape as genocide is well suited for campaigns which involve ethnic cleansing and genocide, as the objective is to destroy, or forcefully remove the target population, and ensure they do not return. Cultural anthropologists, historians and social theorists have indicated that the use of mass rape in wartime has become an integral part of modern-day conflicts, such as in Pakistan, the DRC, Darfur, Liberia, and Colombia. The devastating effects of mass rape do not only affect the person assaulted, but also have a profound impact on familial and community bonds. The destruction wrought by sexual violence weakens the targeted population's survival strategies. The stigma which is associated with rape often results in victims being abandoned, which can lead to the victims being unable to take part in community life, and makes it more difficult to bear and raise children. The use of mass rape allows an enemy to force suffering on an entire community, and in doing this it can lead to the annihilation of the targeted culture.  Perpetrators  The RUF, even though they had access to women, who had been abducted for use as either sex slaves or combatants, frequently raped non-combatants. The militia also carved the RUF initials into women's bodies, which placed them at risk of being mistaken for enemy combatants if they were captured by government forces. Women who were in the RUF were expected to provide sexual services to the male members of the militia. And of all women interviewed, only two had not been repeatedly subjected to sexual violence; gang rape and individual rapes were commonplace. A report from PHR stated that the RUF was guilty of 93 percent of sexual assaults during the conflict. The RUF was notorious for human rights violations, and regularly amputated arms and legs from their victims.  Estimates of victims  Trafficking by military and militias of women and girls, for use as sex slaves is well documented. With reports from recent conflicts such as those in, Angola, the former Yugoslavia, Sierra Leone, Liberia, the DRC, Indonesia, Colombia, Burma and Sudan. During the decade long civil conflict in Sierra Leone, women were used as sex slaves having been trafficked into refugee camps. According to PHR, one third of women who reported sexual violence had been kidnapped, with fifteen per cent forced into sexual slavery. The PHR report also showed that ninety four per cent of internally displaced households had been victims of some form of violence. PHR estimated that there were between 215,000 and 257,000 victims of rape during the conflict. Of the types of assaults reported seventy-six per cent were multiple perpetrator rape (MPR), with seventy-five per cent of these being perpetrated by male only groups. The remaining twenty-five percent of sexual assaults were carried out by mixed sex groups, which indicates that one in four incidents of MPR women had actively participated. HRW reported that \\"Throughout the nine-year Sierra Leonean conflict there has been widespread and systematic sexual violence against women and girls including individual and gang rape, sexual assault with objects such as firewood, umbrellas and sticks, and sexual slavery,\\" and that \\"the rebel factions use sexual violence as a weapon to terrorise, humiliate, punish and ultimately control the civilian population into submission.'\\"  Aftermath  The violence directed towards women during the conflict was extraordinarily brutal. Militias were indiscriminate about the ages of those assaulted, and there was a marked tendency towards younger women and girls believed to be virgins. Some women were raped with such violence they bled to death following the assault. A report by MSF showed that fifty five per cent of survivors had suffered gang rape, with the attacks usually involving insertion of objects such as knives and burning firewood into the vagina. There were reports of pregnant women being eviscerated with rebels placing wagers on the gender of the unborn child. Thirty four per cent of survivors have reported that they have caught a sexually transmitted disease, and a further fifteen per cent have reported being ostracised by their family's due to having been raped. Six percent reported that they had been forcibly impregnated. Women who had been kidnapped and who had spent years living in the bush have reported severe health problems, such as tuberculosis, malnutrition, malaria, skin and intestinal infections, and respiratory diseases.  International and domestic reaction  The International Rescue Committee, in conjunction with the Sierra Leone government founded three Sexual Assault Referral Centers (SARC). Locally the SARC project are called \\"rainbow centers\\" and they give free psychosocial and medical care as well as offering legal advice. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has singled out the SARC project as a \\"best-practice gender-based violence program\\".  Post-war trials  The Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL), was founded on 16 January 2002, and at first adopted the definition of rape as laid down by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in the Dragoljub Kunarac case. The prosecutor of the SCSL focused on investigating gender-related crimes, which resulted in the indictment of thirteen people for gender-related violence. In 2007 a trial chamber of the SCSL found that forced marriage was a crime against humanity, and the appeal chamber upheld this judgement in 2008 stating, \\"forced marriage is a distinct, inhumane act of sufficient gravity to be considered a crime against humanity\\" The prosecutor of the SCSL charged, Brima Bazzy Kamara, Alex Tamba Brima and Santigie Borbor Kanu, who were leaders of the AFRC, with counts of sexual slavery, forced marriages, and other forms of sexual violence committed by the men under their command. On 20 June 2007, the three members of the AFRC were found guilty of rape as a crime against humanity, and sexual slavery as a war crime. They were also found guilty of recruiting child soldiers, who had also carried out acts of sexual violence on non-combatants. The rapes in the indictment were described as \\"brutal\\", and were often in the form of gang rape. The trials of Samuel Hinga Norman, Moinina Fofana and Allieu Kondewa, known as the \\"Civil Defence Forces case\\", made little mention of gender-related crimes, this was due to the majority of the trial chamber's judges systematically excluding evidence. This decision was criticised by the appeals chamber, however it declined a request for a new trial. The trial of three RUF members was the first time in either a national or international court convicted individuals for forced marriage and sexual slavery as a crime against humanity.

The history of the site is believed to date back to 1623 when colonists were ordered to build a fort to protect them from attacking Native Americans or Spanish marauders. Today the remains of the fort, mostly from the American Civil War, are preserved in a public park. Colonial period The fort was begun in 1623, in the wake of a major Native American attack the previous year. Potential attacks by the Spanish were also a consideration. The original fort, called The Castle or the Fort at Warraskoyack (an early name for Isle of Wight County), would have had a triangular shape and been surrounded by a ditch.Fort Boykin at FortWiki.com It was also called Roger Smith's Fort. The earthworks would have been topped by palisade walls. As those threats became less of a concern, the fort was eventually abandoned. During Bacon's Rebellion in 1677, Fort Boykin was active according to the journal of the ship Young Prince. American Revolution During the American Revolutionary War, the area where The Castle was located was refortified. The new fort was named Fort Boykin in honor of Major Francis M. Boykin, a local officer in the Continental Army who was then the owner of the site. He had served on George Washington's staff. It was also known as the Fort at the Rocks, the Rocks being the name of the adjacent plantation. What little was left of The Castle was enlarged upon with new ramparts and gun emplacements added. Military records list no engagements with the enemy either at the fort or in its vicinity, and after the British surrender in 1781 the fort was again abandoned. War of 1812 The fort is believed to have been reworked again during the War of 1812 when it was enlarged to the shape of a five-pointed star. Although the records do not reveal any direct engagements with the fort, it is known that the British warship HMS Plantagenet lay offshore in the river for several months.Fork Boykin Park - Isle of Wight County Museum During that time, the British attempted to land at the wharf of The Rocks plantation, only to be beaten back by the men stationed at the fort. After the war was over, the fort was left to the elements. American Civil War The American Civil War brought a renewed interest in the fort by the Confederate Army, and the size was doubled from that of its previous incarnation. Between June 1861 and May 1862, the Confederate Army cleared, refurbished and refortified Fort Boykin as one in a series of earthworks designed to prevent invasion by the Union, whose buildup at the mouth of the James River posed a severe threat to Richmond. Commander of the Virginia forces Robert E. Lee ordered Col. Andrew Talcott, State Engineer of Virginia, to redesign Fort Boykin in August 1861. Similar defensive works were built at Fort Huger, Mulberry Island, Jamestown Island and Drewry's Bluff. Construction on Fort Boykin soon began under Talcott's son Capt. T.M.R. Talcott and Lt. W.G. Turpin.Fort Boykin plan by Col. Andrew Talcott Some Confederate records call the fort the Day's Point Battery. Although incomplete by May 1862, the fort had positions for 14 guns of which 10 were mounted. A report of March 12, 1862 shows a mix of 32-pounder and 42-pounder smoothbore cannon, all facing the James River. A hot-shot furnace was also at the fort. On May 8, 1862, the fort was fired upon by a Union Navy fleet consisting of the USS Galena, Aroostook, and Port Royal as part of the Peninsula campaign, an unsuccessful Union offensive from Fort Monroe to Richmond. With the Union guns outranging the fort's guns, the soldiers manning the fort spiked their guns and retreated. Union marines came ashore on 17 May, destroyed what they could, and blew up the powder magazine. For the remainder of the war, the site was used by the Confederate Signal Corps, among whose ranks was poet Sidney Lanier. Post Civil War After the Civil War, the fort was no longer used as a military installation and was again left to become an overgrown shadow of itself. The property was bought in 1908 by Herbert and Mary Greer and a house was built inside its earthworks. The Jorden family acquired the property in 1950. After the last owner died in 1976, the fort was given to the state for public use. Present Today the fort remains largely intact, but most of the front wall facing the river has eroded away. It is now the property of Isle of Wight County, and is a public park. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985 for its archaeological potential.

The idea of such a building in downtown Omaha originated in 1915 when a group of Omaha businessmen, including George Brandeis, met to discuss its establishment. The architect selected for the project was John Latenser & Sons. The general contractor was Selden-Breck Construction, and the lead decorator was Hugh Lawson of Orchard & Wilhelm. The first two floors of the ten-story Italian design building were of Bedford limestone, and the upper floors of red brick with stone trim. The building boasted a main dining room and a separate grill room, lounges, a ballroom, a bowling alley, and a billiards room. Furnished rooms were available for out-of-town guests, and a roof-top garden was available for weekend dances. Rental space for six stores was allowed on either side of the ornate entrance. The gymnasium was two stories high. There was a nine-hole golf course in the basement and open air handball and squash courts on the roof. The club's swimming pool was open two days a week to women and one morning a week to boys. At the time of its construction, The Omaha Athletic Club was one of the tallest concrete buildings in Omaha. Total cost of the building and its furnishings was $750,000. The club was opened with public tours on December 12, 1918. A members-only gala was held December 14, 1918. The gala had two dinner seatings, one at 6:30 pm and a late supper at 8:30 pm. There were 1,500 members at the time the club opened. Total membership was limited to 2000 members. Chef Rinaldo \\"Reno\\" Sibilia, of Ticino was installed as the club's chef. He would stay for 49 years. He created well-loved international dishes, including turkey au gratin, a member favorite. Of his kitchen, Sibilia stated in a 1970 interview, \\"We prided ourselves on making any dish a man wanted...to members this was more like home.\\" The club was forced to close in 1970 due to declining memberships. The building was sold in 1977 with plans to redevelop, and then sold again in 1983. Ultimately, the building was demolished by implosion on February 9, 1992 to make room for the Roman L. Hruska Federal Courthouse.

This was the stage where it would be decided whether the cadet would train as a navigator, bombardier, or pilot. * Pre-Flight Stage taught the mechanics and physics of flight and required the cadets to pass courses in mathematics and the hard sciences. Then the cadets were taught to apply their knowledge practically by teaching them aeronautics, deflection shooting, and thinking in three dimensions. The 81st FTW was the only wing which provided preflight training of pilots, navigators and bombardiers Once the cadet successfully completed the training at the center, they would be assigned to one of the AAF primary flight schools for initial flying training. = Lineage= * Established as 81st Flying Training Wing on 14 October 1943 : Activated on 25 August 1943 : Disbanded on 1 November 1945 81st Flying Training Wing, lineage and history document Air Force Historical Agency, Maxwell AFB, Alabama =Assignments= * Army Air Forces Western Flying Training Command, 25 August 1943 – 30 June 1945 =Units= * Army Air Forces Classification Center, 30 April 1942 – 1 May 1944Mueller, Robert (1989).

He began creating his artwork at the end of the 1970s while he was still studying at the school of Fine Arts in Turin. He is currently a professor as well as an artist.  Biography  He first attended the school of Fine Arts in Turin and afterwards studied with Jole Desanna at the Brera Academy. He then continued with Luciano Fabro and Hidetoshi Nagasawa studying at their home in Milan. He held his first solo exhibition at the Tucci Russo Gallery in Turin. At the beginning of the 1980s, during the postmodernism, he began to research different forms of art expression, and at that same time he created his first mature artworks. He was a highlighted artist in important exhibitions in Italy and abroad. His artwork has been shown at Barcelona's Fundació Joan Miró (1985) and at the museum of Contemporary Art in Nice, France (1993) and the sculpture biennial in Carrara (2008).  Artworks  Through his painting Stoisa wishes to express himself artistically in different forms and steers away from all preconceived notions of art. For him art is a constant confrontation between the past and the present. Through the use of different shapes and images, Stoisa transforms his work into poetic links and colour changes. He intentionally works in pure defined forms. His artworks feature contrasts between different surfaces, materials, textures, and dimensions. It is often compared to ready mades and Process Art.Some examples of all these elements were presented in 1990 at the Tucci Russo Gallery, where 4 installations highlighted the theatrical and scenic features of space. = L'Angelo della Pittura (1981) = This is considered one Stoisa's first mature artworks after finishing his education. There's an angel with a palette and brush in hand, depicted in an anachronic style. By his use of novel materials such as oil paint, tar and unframed canvas, it demonstrates his versatility in painting styles. This unframed technique allows Stoisa the freedom to abandon the traditional two dimensional system and leads him to create his later installations. Starting in 1982, he began to experiment with new materials such as copper leaf. = Le nostre strade infinito (Endless Roads, 1986) = A common feature of Stoisa's installations, is the use of tar as main material. In Endless Roads, the artist installed piles of rubber tyres against a wall that left a visual strip of tar creating a path throughout the gallery.

The shinbashira of a Chinese temple in Hangzhou The shinbashira has long been thought to be the key to the Japanese pagoda's notable earthquake resistance, when newer concrete buildings may collapse.  History  Hōryū-ji, the world's oldest wooden structure, was found to have in 2001 a shinbashira from a tree felled in 594 CE. Their examples continue in impending centuries in other tō (塔, pagoda) like the Hokkiji in Nara in 8th century, and Kaijūsenji of Kyoto.  Architecture  The pillar structure is made out of straight trunks of Japanese cypress (hinoki). The pillar runs the entire (but see below) length of the pagoda, and juts out of the top 'layer' of the pagoda, where it supports the finial of the pagoda. The initial architectural forms included the pillar ingrained deep within the foundation (Shinso ja: 心礎) Hōryūji Gojū-no-tou 法隆寺五重塔, (Gojū-no-tō: 5-layered-pagoda) was found to be 3m below ground level. At this time, pillars were tapered and became roughly circular from the point where they rose beyond the roof, starting as hexagonal from the base. This shaping was necessary as metal pieces were fit to the central pillar to support the spire. Later uses starting 12c involve them suspended just above the ground, thus making them suspensions like the Nikkō Tōshōgū Gojū-no-tū 日光東照宮五重塔 (1818) in Tochigi prefecture. Size had a bearing on the fragmentation of the pillars found in the 8th century. The central pillar of Gojuu-no-tou at Hōryūji has a height of 31.5 m with a diameter of 77.8 cm at base, 65.1 cm in the middle and approximately 24.1 cm at the midpoint on the spire. Such huge pillars had to be divided into three sections: from the base stone to the third floor; from the fourth story to the point where the spire begins, and the spire section. The shaft of a three-storied pagoda (sanjuu-no-tou 三重塔), is divided between the second and third stories and again where the spire begins. During the 8c, shinbashira were erected on a base stone set at ground level. Example: Hokkiji Sanjuu-no-tou 法起寺三重塔 (742) in Nara. (see Earthquake Resistance below)  Earthquake resistance  Japan is an earthquake prone country, yet records show that only two of the pagodas have collapsed during the past 1,400 years owing to an earthquake. Hanshin earthquake in 1995 killed 6,400 people, toppled elevated highways, flattened office blocks and devastated the port area of Kobe. Yet it left the magnificent five-storey pagoda at the Tō-ji Temple in nearby Kyoto unscathed, though it levelled a number of lower buildings in the neighbourhood. The reason traditionally attributed has been the shinbashira; newer research shows that the very wide eaves also contribute to the inertial stability of the pagoda. Overall deductions have not been very simplistic. Some of structural engineer Shuzo Ishida's model pagodas have a simulated shinbashira attached to the ground, as was common in pagodas built during the sixth to eighth centuries. Others simulate later designs with the shinbashira resting on a beam on the second floor or suspended from the fifth. Compared with a model with no shinbashira at all, Ishida finds that the one with a central column anchored to the ground survives longest, and is at least twice as strong as any other shinbashira arrangement. Studies about shinbashira and their quake resistant attributes have been many. These studies are now materializing even in brick-and-mortar buildings like the Tokyo Skytree. (see below) (see relevant links and citations for further reading on the other earthquake bearing of Japanese pagodas)  Modern uses  Pursuant studies of the shinbashira structure, and its utility in quake-resistance has made it to be used anew in structures including the Tokyo Skytree. A central feature of the tower is a system to control swaying used for the first time, has been dubbed \\"shinbashira\\" after the central pillar found in traditional five-story pagodas. The 375-meter-long, steel-reinforced concrete shinbashira is not directly connected to the tower itself and is designed to cancel out the swaying of the needle-like tower during an earthquake. According to an official with Nikken Sekkei, which designed the structure, the concept was developed on the basis that pagodas rarely topple during earthquakes.See Article More recently in San Francisco, the renovation of 680 Folsom Street, a fourteen-story 1960s steel building, inspired an ultra-modern iteration of the shinbashira: an 8-million-pound structural concrete core that can freely pivot atop a single sliding friction-pendulum bearing during a large earthquake. Tipping Mar, the engineering firm behind the design, used performance-based design and nonlinear time-history analysis to prove that the solution would meet the goals of the California Building Code.See Putting a Good Spin on Value Engineering.

The carriage was later chosen by Nazi Germany as the symbolic setting of Pétain's June 1940 armistice. Left to right: Joachim von Ribbentrop, Wilhelm Keitel, Hermann Göring, Rudolf Hess, Adolf Hitler, Erich Raeder partially obscured and Walther von Brauchitsch in front of the Armistice carriage The Compiègne Wagon was the train carriage in which both the Armistice of 11 November 1918 and Armistice of 22 June 1940 were signed. Before the 1918 signing in the Forest of Compiègne, the wagon served as the personal carriage of Ferdinand Foch and was later displayed in French museums. However, after the successful invasion of France, Adolf Hitler had the wagon moved back to the exact site of the 1918 signing for the 1940 signing due to its symbolic role. The wagon was later destroyed near the end of World War II, most likely by the SS. History The Compiègne Wagon was built in 1914 in Saint-Denis as dining car No. 2419D. It was used throughout the First World War in that capacity for Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits, the company best known for operating the Orient Express. In August 1918, the wagon was commandeered by the French Army and converted into the office and mobile headquarters of Ferdinand Foch, the Supreme Allied Commander, who began using it in October 1918. On 8 November 1918, Foch and representatives from the Allied Powers and the German Empire signed the armistice in the then-called \\"Wagon of Compiègne\\". This agreement was the final ceasefire which ended fighting in the First World War; the other Central Powers had already reached agreements with the Allied Powers to end hostilities. The car was later returned to Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits and briefly resumed service as a dining car. In September 1919, it was donated to the Musée de l'Armée, in Paris. The wagon was on display in the Musée's Cour des Invalides from 1921 to 1927. At the request of the Mayor of Compiègne, and with the support of the American Arthur Henry Fleming, the car was restored and returned to Compiègne. It was housed in a specially created museum building as part of the \\"Glade of the Armistice\\" historic monument, with the car a few meters from the exact site of the signing ceremony During World War II, Hitler ordered that the wagon be moved to exactly the same location for the signing of the second \\"armistice at Compiègne\\", on 22 June 1940; this time with Germany victorious. The carriage was moved out of its protective building and returned to the signing-place, which was several metres away and had been marked out as part of the monument. Subsequently, the wagon was taken to Berlin and displayed a week later at the Berlin Cathedral. In 1944 the wagon was sent to Thuringia, in central Germany. Then it moved to Ruhla and later Gotha Crawinkel, near a huge tunnel system. There it was destroyed in March 1945 by the SS with fire and/or dynamite, in the face of the advancing U.S. Army. However, some SS veterans and civilian eyewitnesses claim that the wagon had been destroyed by air attack near Ohrdruf while still in Thuringia in April 1944. Even so, it is generally believed the wagon was destroyed in 1945 by the SS. =Replica= Today's historical wagon is an exact copy of the original one. In 1950, French manufacturer Wagons-Lits, the company that ran the Orient Express, donated a car from the same series to the museum — 2439D is identical to its ravaged twin, from its polished wooden finishes to its studded, leather-bound chairs. This car had also been part of Foch's private train during the 1918 signing. At the 1950 ceremony, it was renumbered No. 2419D. It is parked beside the display of the original car's remains: a few fragments of bronze decoration and two access ramps.AP news: Hitler in war, Merkel in peace: A train car for history Retrieved 2018-11-10 Notes Category:World War I memorials in France Category:Railway coaches of France Category:France in World War II Category:Treaty signing historic sites Category:Compiègne ","title":"Compiègne Wagon"},{"id":"42184761","text":"Ahmed Mahmoud Mohamed Abu Kabeer (; born 7 May 1990) is a Jordanian football player who currently plays as an attacking midfielder for Al-Hussein.

History = Formation = In the late 1960s, guitarist Rune Walle (b. 1951) and drummer Gunnar Bergstrøm (b. 1952) became acquainted. They were both highly sought after musicians in the Bergen music scene, due to their young age and high musical skill level. In 1973, both of them were recruited for the second line-up of popular rock group Saft, with whom they recorded their award-winning album \\"Stev, sull, rock & roll\\", which also included violinist and folk musician Sigbjørn Bernhoft Osa. Wanting to create a more country-driven sound, heavily inspired by bands such as the Eagles and the Flying Burrito Brothers, Walle and Bergstrøm left the band to form their own, titled \\"Flying Norwegians\\", in January 1974. To complete the line-up they recruited several other known musicians in the area; Cato Sanden (b. 1954) on guitars, keyboard player Jarle Zimmerman (b. Jarle Fjellanger, 1950) and bass guitarist Johannes Torkelsen (b. 1952). Sanden and Zimmermann shared vocal duties, with Sanden providing the lead vocals on most occasions. = New Day and Wounded Bird = With a line-up with all-experienced and well known musicians, the band was given a record deal nearly instantly, and entered the studio to record their first album, \\"New Day\\". Met with high praise it sold fairly by Norwegian standards, selling 50 000 copies during 1974–75, and the band was dubbed \\"The Norwegian Eagles\\" by several news outlets. Following a popular tour to support the album, the band returned to the studio in late 1975 to record their second, and best known album, \\"Wounded Bird\\", released in 1976 to rave reviews and impressive sales, reaching No. 12 on the Norwegian album charts. = Flyvende Nordmenn = Whilst writing and recording their own material in 1975, the band was asked by their fellow musician and friend, Teddy Nelson, to be his supporting band for his debut album, Diggy Liggy. For this the band recruited another friend, steel guitarist Egil Skjelnes, to give the band the needed sound. In order to keep their own studio career as a separate venture, they translated their name to Norwegian; recording under the name \\"Flyvende Nordmenn\\". This alternative line-up remained with Nelson for his first four albums (except Walle and Torkelsen, who only appeared on the first album). Three of these were in Norwegian, while the fourth was a venture into English country-rock songs, released under the name \\"Teddy Nelson and the Flying Norwegians\\". The album, entitled Point of Departure, is today considered part of both artists main catalogue. = Changes and final albums = In the spring of 1976 the band resumed touring while not in the studio, a tour which included a brief stint as opening act for the Ozark Mountain Daredevils during their 1976 spring tour of Scandinavia. A few weeks later, in June 1976, Rune Walle was contacted with the offer to replace Randle Chowning as guitarist in Ozark Mountain Daredevils, following the latters abrupt departure. Walle had impressed the other members of the band during Flying Norwegians shows as opening act, and they requested that he join them for the US leg of their 1976 tour. He accepted the offer, and played his first show with the group at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City on July 23, 1976 on a bill that also included The Beach Boys, The Doobie Brothers, Jeff Beck and Firefall. This did, however, mean that touring and recording was put on halt for Flying Norwegians. On January 10, 1977, four of the five original members reunited for a farewell concert in their hometown of Bergen; a concert which was recorded and released soon after. Bass guitarist Torkelsen had departed when Walle left for the US, and was replaced with Jan Ove Hommel for the show. Following a one-year break, Sanden reformed the band in 1978, with Egil Skjelnes (steel guitar), Ronald Jensen (bass) and Jan Ove Hommel (guitars) joining Sanden, Zimmerman and Bergstrøm to form a full line-up. This version was however short-lived, recording the album This Time Around to mixed reviews in 1979, and a brief tour. In 1981, in an attempt to break into mainstream music once again, the band began recording their fourth studio album, Du står i veien (Nor. You're in my way), with new-wave inspired rock songs in Norwegian. This upset Sanden, who was a country- and rock musician at heart, and he left the band just as work began. Skjelnes, Hommel and Jensen all left with him, and studio musicians Bjørn Tore Aasheim (guitars) and Atle Mjørhaug (bass) were recruited to finish the album, with Zimmerman taking over lead vocals. The album was a disaster, met with poor sales and reviews, and the group soon disbanded. = Solo careers and later years = Sanden, Zimmermann and Walle all had successful solo careers following their time with Flying Norwegians. Walle, having returned to Norway in 1980, recorded several albums that sold fairly, as did Zimmerman. It was Sanden, however, who had the most success, with his two first albums both winning Album of the Year awards (in 1984 and 86), and the second album, Living Today, also being the most sold record in Norway in 1986. Torkelsen and Skjelnes returned to work with Teddy Nelson in 1981, and remained in his touring band until Nelsons death in 1992. The other members also appeared sporadically with the group. In 1994, twenty years after their first album, the original five members reunited, performing a handful of concerts in Norway. At the same time the two albums recorded by the original line-up was re-released on CD, selling to gold. In 1996 they entered the studio for the first time together since 1975 and recorded the band's fifth album, Still Riding. Following a brief set of concerts, they disbanded once again in 1997. Following this the band had occasional reunions and concerts, the last of which took place on April 28, 2005 in Bergen. Five days later, on May 3, Sanden died unexpectedly of a heart attack, aged 51. Today, most of the members remain active, performing studio work, whilst stating that the death of Sanden \\"retired the band for good\\".

It may result either from direct interactions between those affected – including traumatic experiences of domestic violence, abuse, neglect, parental misbehavior such as repetitive explosive outbursts or intense marital conflict and disagreements, attachment disorders, differing values and beliefs, disappointment, major life events or change, or poor communication – or from the involvement or interference of a third party. Agllias, Kylie. (Sep 2013). Family Estrangement. Encyclopedia of Social Work. Subject: Couples and Families, Aging and Older Adults, Children and Adolescents. Carr, Holman, Abetz, Kellas, Vagnoni. (2015). Giving Voice to the Silence of Family Estrangement: Comparing Reasons of Estranged Parents and Adult Children in a Nonmatched Sample The estrangement is often unwanted, or considered unsatisfactory, by at least one party involved. For example, as a child transitions into adulthood, the adult child may cease contact with his or her parents and possibly other family members. In another scenario, an intolerant parent might reject an adult child because of the child's life choices.  Overview  Family estrangements are broken relationships between parents, grandparents, siblings and children. Although a family estrangement can begin at any stage of life, it often begins during late adolescence or early adulthood. Characteristics of estrangement may include a lack of empathy in one or more of the parties involved. This can result in heightened levels of stress in all parties, although in the case of an abusive relationship the victim may feel a sense of relief once the source of stress has been removed. A significant proportion of estrangements involve a third party, such as a member of the extended family or the adult child's spouse. In some cases, the third party provides emotional support to the individual initiating the estrangement, providing the estranger with an alternate social support system and thus enabling the deepening of the estrangement. In other instances, the third party – either deliberately or not consciously – is actually the sole or primary cause of two family members becoming estranged. Parental alienation is a theory of third-party estrangement whereby, typically, one parent involved in a family separation psychologically manipulates a child into rejecting the other parent and possibly other family members. The rejected individual, or estrangee, may or may not try a number of strategies to repair the rift. In some cases, taking responsibility and making amends for harsh words or difficult circumstances may improve the relationship. However, if the estrangement is the result of a behavioural pattern (such as a personality disorder) rather than a sequence of unfortunate life events, it is doubtful that the relationship will survive in any meaningful form. In some cases, the initiator of the estrangement stipulates boundaries in order to maintain limited contact (and therefore limit emotional damage) with the person they see as a potential abuser. In other cases, the initiator is unable or unwilling to consider any type of reconciliation. = Health implications = Although the rejected party's psychological and physical health may decline, the estrangement initiator's may improve due to the cessation of abuse and conflict.Agllias, K. (2011a). Every family: Intergenerational estrangement between older parents and their adult-children. (Doctoral dissertation, School of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Newcastle, Callaghan).McKnight, A. S. (2003). The impact of cutoff in families raising adolescents. In P. Titelman (Ed.), Emotional cutoff: Bowen family systems theory perspectives (pp. 273–284). New York, NY: Haworth Clinical Practice Press. The social rejection in family estrangement is the equivalent of ostracism which undermines four fundamental human needs: the need to belong, the need for control in social situations, the need to maintain high levels of self-esteem, and the need to have a sense of meaningful existence.Williams, Kipling D. (2002). Ostracism: the power of silence. New York: Guilford. The rejected parties suffer adverse psychological consequences such as loneliness, low self-esteem, aggression, and depression.McDougall, P., Hymel, S., Vaillancourt, T., & Mercer, L. (2001). The consequences of childhood rejection. In M. R. Leary (Ed.), Interpersonal rejection. (pp. 213-247). New York, NY: Oxford University Press. Family estrangement activates the grief response. However, the rejected family may not achieve the final grief stage of acceptance, given that the social death of the relationship is potentially reversible. The prolonged suffering of the rejected party, together with a perceived or real stigma of having been rejected by a family member, results in isolation and behavioral changes in the rejected party.Boss, P. (2006). Loss, trauma and resilience: Therapeutic work with ambiguous loss. New York NY: W.W. Norton & Company, Inc.Walter, C.A. & McCoyd, J.L.M. (2009). Grief and loss across the lifespan: A biopsyosocial perspective. New York, NY: Springer. Social workers who work with the elderly population are at the forefront of a new fallout from the family estrangement. Non-supportive or absent family members during someone's end-of-life acutely increase the pain and stress of the final days. Additional stress in financial, medical and welfare sectors requires a re-evaluation of the social policy regarding family expectations versus governmental support systems. = Culture = The separation of young adults from their families of origin in order to create families of their own is part of normal human development. According to Bowen theory, this separation can be achieved in a healthy and gradual manner that preserves the intergenerational relationships of the family of origin, providing both the new family and family of origin with a sense of continuity and support. Alternately, a schism can differentiate these life stages. Familial estrangement falls into the second category. The emphasis on the individual over a collective family unit is regarded as contributing to estrangement, as well as a rationale for estrangement.Coleman, Joshua. (25 Aug 2010). How parents can start to reconcile with estranged kids. Greater Good: The Science of a Meaningful Life. http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/how_parents_can_start_to_reconcile_with_their_kids In individualistic cultures, the estranger typically justifies the estrangement in relation to emotional, physical or sexual abuse. Estrangers who have suffered abuse often receive emotional support/validation as it can be easier for them to articulate and get others to understand their experience. For some victims of psychological or emotional abuse the damage has been done over a long period of time by a characteristic pattern of subtle deniable abuse. For these people, validation may never appear in any meaningful form unless it is professional help. The estranged may also become less socially accepted because of lowered self-regulation, a reaction to the social rejection.Richman, Laura Smart. Leary, Mark R. (2009) Reactions to discrimination, stigmatization, ostracism, and other forms of interpersonal rejection: A multimotive model. Psychology Review. 116(2). DOI: 10.1037/a0015250  Contributing causes  Although working through stressful issues with communication, consideration and compassion can be a healthy coping mechanism, the effort can be demanding. = Value or identity conflict = A family member's sexual orientation, choice of spouse, gender identity, disability, religion or lack thereof may cause the estranged party to feel judged, unloved, or unaccepted causing them to initiate the estrangement or may cause the parents to disown their child. Life choices regarding education, profession, and geography are other potentially emotionally charged topics that reflect social values. Working through feelings to reach an understanding that accommodates the individual within the family unit challenges each individual's sense of identity as part of a society. When one or more family members rank their expectations and emotions as more important than those of another family member, then the conversation becomes a zero-sum game. This is known as a social trap in social psychology, a situation where the long-term consequences of decisions result in a cumulative loss to all parties. In these instances, estrangement is more likely than accommodation. =Divorce = Divorce was cited as a reason for estrangement by 12.3% of parents and 2.3% of children. =Child abuse = Child abuse in the form of emotional, psychological, sexual, or physical abuse was cited by 13.9% of children who initiated estrangement with one or both parents as a reason for estrangement. Furthermore, 2.9% of estranged parents acknowledged their failure to prevent the abuse. =Substance abuse= Substance and alcohol abuse, on the part of either the estranger or the estranged, are common causes of family tension and the resulting separation. The most highly predictive domain of social estrangement for both alcohol and drug dependency is homelessness.Sanna J. Thompson, Lynn Rew, Amanda Barczyk, Pepper McCoy, and Ada Mi-Sedhi. (October 2009) Social Estrangement: Factors Associated with Alcohol or Drug Dependency among Homeless, Street-Involved Young Adults. Journal of Drug Issues 39: 905-929, =Mental illness= Mental illness on the part of either the estranger or the estranged is also a common cause of family tension and estrangement. Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is correlated with family estrangement. Both the PTSD sufferer's symptoms and the family members' failure to be sufficiently supportive can contribute to the estrangement. Studies on soldiers with PTSD have concluded that families with a PTSD patient require more support to facilitate healing and prevent estrangement.Ray, Susan L, Vanstone, Meredith. \\"The impact of PTSD on veterans' family relationships: An interpretive phenomenological inquiry. 2009 Jun;46(6):838-47. doi: 10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2009.01.002. =Personality disorders= Personality disorders, particularly the cluster B personality disorders (antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, histrionic personality disorder, and narcissistic personality disorder), cause significant interpersonal conflicts. Sufferers typically have volatile relationships and may be both the estranger and the estranged multiple times throughout their lives. = Betrayal of trust = From disputes over inheritances to perceived insults in public settings, a sense of betrayal can weaken the trust bonds of a family. According to developmental psychologist Erik Erikson, trust is the foundation of any relationship.  Explanations  There are underlying psychological factors that explain family estrangement beyond the surface rationale of the scenario. = Bowen theory = In Bowen family systems theory, emotional cutoff and avoidance are unhealthy coping mechanisms for dealing with anxiety and stress. These coping mechanisms represent emotional and intellectual systems that are fused rather than differentiated, so that emotions overwhelm objective thought process and govern behavior. Poor differentiation is associated with continued relationship problems in life. Poor differentiation is also contagious in that it may induce stress in others. High differentiation is associated with emotional interdependence and multi-generational cooperation. Triangulation is when a third party enters the dynamic. A third party, however, may increase tension and trigger a rebellion. = Victim – persecutor – rescuer = The Karpman drama triangle is precipitated by a familial estrangement that involves a third party. A family member plays the victim role, casting the family as the persecutor. The new romantic interest, close friend or another family, for psychological motivations of their own, come to the victim's rescue and in so doing validates the dynamic for the victim.  Substitute families  Both the estranger and the estranged may use social and work relationships to create substitute families.The Bowen Center http://www.thebowencenter.org/theory/eight-concepts/emotional-cutoff/ Support groups and other highly emotional organizations also provide a conduit for emotional energy from unresolved issues with parents, siblings and other family members.McKnight, A. S. (2003). The impact of cutoff in families raising adolescents. In P. Titelman (Ed.), Emotional cutoff: Bowen family systems theory perspectives. New York, NY: Haworth Clinical Practice Press. Becoming passionate about a cause or hobby is another coping mechanism, termed sublimation in psychiatry.

Plot Fitz asks Jake to find more information from the same source that leaked the location of the Kashfar hostages hinting at a promotion if he is successful. Cyrus locates Charlie and asks him to investigate Jake. Across town David returns home to find his apartment ransacked. He hears someone in his apartment and hides, seeing only the shoes of the burglar as they retreat. Shaken up he relocates to Olivia's offices. As Huck and Quinn tail CIA director Osborne they realize they've been made as he makes his way to Olivia's building. They warn Olivia that he is coming and she hides Wendy's flash drive which Jake, who is watching through the cameras he has in her apartment, sees. The two have a tense meeting and Osborne tell her to back off. While he is at Olivia's apartment the cameras Jake is using malfunction. The next morning Hollis Doyle arrives at Olivia's offices with his fourth ex- wife and a video of his daughter Maybelle telling him she has been kidnapped and he needs to wire 20 million dollars to a secret account. His wife is moved to tears but Doyle believes that his daughter orchestrated the entire thing in order to access his money after he cut her off for being a drug addict. He asks the team to locate his daughter but refuses to pay any money in order to ensure her safety. While the team search for Maybelle, Hollis is sent a package that contains Maybelle's ear but remains unmoved until he is sent video evidence of Maybelle missing the ear. The team sends half the money to the kidnapper and then send the other half after they see Maybelle is alive. They bring her to a hospital where she tells them her ex-boyfriend was the kidnapper. Jake breaks into Olivia's apartment to fix the cameras and steal the flash drive she has hidden. He brings the information to Fitz, and tells him that Osborne is the mole. Cyrus discovers through Charlie that Fitz was involved with Jake in a top secret mission in Iran called Operation Remington. He tells Fitz that the work he did stealing votes in Defiance is similar to Fitz's top secret mission in Iran and Fitz brings him back to the fold, telling Cyrus about his plans to raid Osborne's house and expose him as the mole. Jake tries to go on another date with Olivia but she tells him she is still preoccupied by her last relationship. He insists he is still interested in her and the two kiss. Huck and Harrison discover that Maybelle kidnapped herself. When she tries to leave with her money Huck picks her up and her parents confront her. Hollis tells her she can come back to the family home or she can leave with the money. Maybelle chooses the money and cuts off her relationship with her parents. Osborne goes to Cyrus and denies that he's the mole. Cyrus informs him that it's out of his hands and that Fitz has made the decision. Fitz discovers that Mellie has cancelled the family weekend he has planned involving their two children. When he accuses her of not loving their children and being cold she reveals that she cancelled in order to protect the children who are afraid of their father and can smell the liquor on him. At Olivia Pope and Associates the gladiators hear the news that George Osborne committed suicide. Jake sits on a bench drinking coffee when a man (Joe Morton) sits down beside him.

Chief scientist Antonio Forenza and Perlman released a white paper in 2011 that promoted what it called Distributed-Input-Distributed-Output technology. Following this release and an on-camera presentation, debate began about the legitimacy of the technology, due to its perceived violation of the noisy- channel coding theorem's \\"Shannon limit\\". In May 2013, Rearden LLC sought an experimentation license from the FCC. In response to an FCC question, the company disclosed that each experimental transmitter unit would contain up to 100 antennas. In February 2014 Perlman and Forenza promoted the company and technology at Columbia University. In 2015, the technology was called pCell.  Technology  Artemis says pCell technology is able to work around physical barriers that apply to conventional wireless data transmission. The basis for the technology is software-defined radio which uses interference to create individual virtual cell sites for each wireless user. By tightly coordinating the transmissions from each cell transmitter, the effects of interference between cells is canceled out at each user's location, allowing the deployment of hundreds of times as many cell transmitters over the same area. This reduces the ratio of users per cell, and inversely increases each user's share of the network capacity. Ultimately, if the network deploys as many cell stations as there are users, then each user effectively has their own cell without the need to share with other users. Artemis says that pCell technology is more flexible than conventional cellular wireless technology. Conventional technology can also deploy additional cells to reduce the user-per-cell ratio, but it requires each cell to run at reduced power to avoid interfering with its neighbouring cells. This reduces the service area of each cell to serve only those users nearest to it. On the other hand, adding additional pCells does not require power reductions, and the pCell can contribute bandwidth to users even when they are closer to other pCells. This means that pCells can be more effective than conventional cellular when users are distributed unevenly between the cells. This works best in open areas where there are no obstacles blocking the signals between the user and multiple pCells. In a demonstration at Columbia University, a demonstration transmitter unit ran off 1 milliwatt of power (equivalent power to Class 3 Bluetooth) and transmitted video simultaneously over a few metres to about 8 devices. Battery power may also be saved on the devices connected to the pCell technology compared to conventional 4G LTE. The Artemis website shows 3 demonstration videos, the previously described Columbia University one, another at Code Conference with 20 iPads, and a lab demo showing 16 phones sharing 8 cells. Artemis says cellphones and devices that support LTE could be compatible with pCell networks without replacement of the radios. Perlman refutes claims that pCell is simply MU-MIMO, saying that pCells are spaced farther apart than LTE MIMO.https://venturebeat.com/2014/02/20/steve-perlman-pcell-is-real-and-it- will-change-the-world-interview/ Steve Perlman: pCell’s wireless tech is realhttps://spectrum.ieee.org/telecom/wireless/can-artemis-deliver-5g-service- on-your-4g-phone Can Artemis Deliver 5G Service On Your 4G Phone?

He is best known for the films Miracles from Heaven, Heaven Is for Real, and the New York Times best-seller book The Wait, which he co-wrote with his wife Meagan Good. Early life Franklin was raised in Oakland, CA, the son of Donald Ray Franklin and Paulette Franklin. Franklin has two brothers, Donald Ray and David Brandon. The couple would ultimately separate, and Paulette and her three young boys moved into her parents' home. A few years later, Franklin’s father died at the age of 36 after suffering a heart attack. His mother, grandmother and her seven sisters formed what Franklin has called a “coalition” of strong women that guided him and his brothers in the absence of their father. In a 2016 Mother’s Day essay, Franklin wrote of his upbringing: “While she did make sure we had strong males in our life, like my grandfather and my pastor (who was also my uncle), my mother wanted to give us something more than that. My mother’s answer was to bring together a coalition of women, the same women who she was raised with…. They were always an integral part of her life and naturally became an integral part of our life too, even more so after my father died. These nine women (my mother, Grandmother, Aunt Nuna, Aunt Jayne, Aunt Ida, Aunt Enis, Aunt Chrystal, Aunt Donna and Aunt Sondra) were not only the village that would raise us, but also formed the foundation of who we would become as men.” Following his father’s death, Franklin threw himself into academics and activities as means of coping with the loss. This would ultimately lead to his interest in theater and his passion for movies and television. As a teenager, he would study different movies and television shows to figure out how stories and scenes were put together in the hope of understanding how to move and inspire people through entertainment, the way The Cosby Show and The Color Purple had inspired him. Additionally, during this time he began helping out at his uncle’s church and preached his first sermon at the age of 15. Education Franklin graduated from the University of Southern California in 2000 with a major in Business Administration and a minor in Cinema-Television. Career =Early career= Franklin began his career during his time as a student at University of Southern California as an intern at Overbrook Entertainment, working for Will Smith and James Lassiter. Upon graduation from USC, Franklin accepted a full-time position at Overbrook. Following this, he worked in Tracey Edmonds’ company Edmonds Entertainment as a junior executive. =Studio Positions= Franklin made the transition into Hollywood’s studio system in 2003 when he took up a creative executive position at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. In his book, Produced by Faith, Franklin describes his time at MGM as critical in reaffirming his passion for filmmaking thanks to the creative input his new role afforded him in helping contribute to projects like John Travolta's 2005 crime-comedy Be Cool. \\"Following my policy of trying to add value and contribute wherever possible, I managed to make an impact despite being the lowest man on the corporate ladder.\\" His time at MGM, however, would be short-lived. In 2005, following months of rumors, Sony Pictures Entertainment bought out MGM. Following the sale, Franklin was offered a position and brought on as a Director of Development at Sony’s Columbia Pictures. In his new role at Columbia, Franklin would oversee a number of the studio's hit films, like The Pursuit of Happyness, Hancock and Seven Pounds. Not only would his work on these projects lead to his eventual promotion to VP at Columbia, but they would also be a full circle moment of sorts for Franklin, who would collaborate with his former boss and mentor from Overbrook Entertainment, Will Smith, in making these movies. In an interview with Millennial Magazine, Franklin discussed how The Pursuit of Happyness showed him what was possible for his work within Hollywood and so drove him to make films that trigger audiences to go after something. He explained: “I want people’s hearts to be touched, their lives to be touched, and I want the evidence of that to show up at the box office.” During his time as VP at Columbia Pictures, Franklin supervised a variety of films. He helped produce The Pink Panther 2, the faith-based film Not Easily Broken, The Ugly Truth, and Whitney Houston's Sparkle (released in 2012). Not only did he champion box-office hits like The Karate Kid and Jumping the Broom, he was also recognized as one of the youngest and most influential executives under 35 years of age by The Hollywood Reporter. And he was given the title of a Top 10 Industry Impact Player by the NAACP. In 2012, following these sweeping successes, Franklin continued to rise in the ranks at Columbia, becoming Senior Vice President of Production, which made him one of the youngest people in the industry to hold such a position.http://www.sonypictures.com/corp/press_releases/2012/07_12/07312012_franklin.html In this position, Franklin developed and supervised production of new commercial material, and honed his focus for urban and faith-based markets with films like the diversified remake of Annie and the sleeper hit Heaven Is For Real. One of Franklin's first projects as Senior VP was adapting the New York Times Bestseller Heaven is for Real into a feature-length film. Reading the book in one sitting, Franklin was immediately engrossed by the material and the message; he helped develop the script and oversaw the entire project. \\"[I wanted the movie to be] a message of peace to those who have lost loved ones and who may be wondering what happens next,” he stated. Having lost his own father at a very young age, DeVon wanted audience members who could relate to the Burpo family to walk away with a sense of hope, peace and inspiration. Produced on a modest $12 million budget, Heaven is for Real outpaced all industry estimates and grossed more than $100 million at the box office, making it one of the highest-grossing faith-based films of all time. One of Franklin’s final projects during his time as a studio executive was the reimagining of the classic story “Annie.” Franklin served as an executive on the project alongside Sony’s Ange Giannetti, who Franklin has since called a mentor in his time at the studio. In his role as an executive on the film, he developed the script, put the movie together, oversaw production, and even helped promote the film when it was being released. In promoting the film, Franklin noted that what made the film unique is that “for the first time, we’re doing 'Annie' with a diverse cast, and capturing modern day New York with a different flavor. When you see the story, the whole idea of Annie believing that one day she will find her parents, and ultimately finding her family in a way that she never anticipated. I think that story is very resonant for today, as it has been for previous generations. Because 'Annie' is one of those classic stories that throughout generations has always been a phenomenal story about faith, about the power of connection and community, and about family. This reimagining of the classic tale is going to be as relevant for this generation as it has been for previous generations.” =Franklin Entertainment= Franklin started Franklin Entertainment in July 2014, with a first-look production deal at Sony Pictures Entertainment. Franklin Entertainment is a multimedia entertainment company in which Franklin currently serves as President and CEO. In 2016, the company signed a new multi-year, first-look, production deal with 20th Century Fox, where it is now based. In 2016, Franklin produced the hit film Miracles from Heaven, based on the book Miracles from Heaven by Christy Beam. This American Christian drama stars Jennifer Garner, Queen Latifah, Kylie Rogers, Martin Henderson, John Carroll Lynch, and Eugenio Derbez. The movie recounts the true story of Beam’s daughter who had a rare, incurable disease, but after a freak accident is miraculously cured. The movie was made for $13 million, and, although getting mixed reviews from critics, it grossed $73 million at the box office worldwide. It was nominated for Favorite Dramatic Movie in the People’s Choice Awards, Best Actress in the Teen Choice Awards, and won the award for Best Movie for Drama in the Teen Choice Awards Choice . Franklin is also exec- producing the animated film The Star, for Sony Pictures Animation. The Star is directed by Oscar nominee Timothy Reckart. This faith-based film inspired by the Nativity Story focuses on a donkey and his friends on an adventure as they follow The Star and become accidental heroes. The Star is set to be released November 2017 and will feature the voice of Kelly Clarkson as Leah the Horse, Oprah Winfrey as Deborah, Tyler Perry as Cyrus, Steven Yeun as Bo the donkey, Aidy Bryant as Ruth the sheep, Keegan-Michael Key, Kristen Chenoweth, Anthony Anderson, Gabriel Iglesias, Ving Rhames, Deliah Rene, Kris Kristofferson, Gina Rodriguez, Zachary Levi, Christopher Plummer, and Tracy Morgan. Franklin also has several film projects in the works, including Breakthrough, for 20th Century Studios, which tells the true story of John Smith who at 14 drowned in Lake St. Louis and was dead for nearly an hour. Smith’s mother entered the room praying loudly and suddenly Smith had a pulse. He is also producing the film adaptation of the recently released memoir from Cathy Byrd 'The Boy Who Knew Too Much.' Franklin is also at work on the reboot of He-Man and the Masters Of The Universe franchise with Columbia Pictures, as well as the remake of the film Cooley High with Common at MGM. On the TV side, Franklin is producing a re-imagining of Foxy Brown at Hulu starring Meagan Good. =Preacher and TV personality= According to Franklin, he began preaching at the age of 15. He is a regular on The Dr. Oz Show, offering his guidance on a range of topics including faith, relationships and spiritual wellness. He has made appearances on Dr. Phil, CBS This Morning, Entertainment Tonight, Oprah's Super Soul Sunday, and was named to Oprah's SuperSoul100 list of visionaries and influential leaders. Works Franklin is the author of two best-selling books, Produced By Faith and New York Times best-seller The Wait. His upcoming book The Hollywood Commandments: A Spiritual Guide to Secular Success will be released October 2017. =Produced By Faith= Produced By Faith was released in June 2012 and emphasizes how faith, life and work all interact and are parallel. The book is a dynamic business model for building a thriving career without compromising your faith. In an interview with Deadline Hollywood, Franklin says, “The idea of the book is, you don’t have to compromise your faith to pursue your career dreams.” Franklin shows how to discover The Big Idea for your life, take your career to the next level, recognize the signs God sends you that indicate when it’s time to move in a new direction, stand firm on your Christian principles without compromise, and choose a profession, industry, or company that is in tune with your purpose. =The Wait= Franklin co-wrote his second book, The Wait, with his wife Meagan Good. The book was released in February 2016 and quickly became a New York Times bestseller in several categories. In the book, the couple share their personal love story, and the message that waiting until marriage can help you find the person you are meant to be with. The book describes the most important moments from their relationship and advice on how waiting can transform relationships. Fox LA says The Wait “…talks about finding true love through celibacy, as well as the benefits of delayed gratification in all walks of life (professional, personal, spiritual etc). They use their own personal story of waiting as an example.” =The Hollywood Commandments= The Hollywood Commandments, published by HarperOne, was released September 26, 2017. The book is described as one that will encourage readers to pursue their passion in every area of life, including career, relationships, and faith. = The Truth About Men = In 2019, he published The Truth About Men : What Men and Women Need to Know.

Bayside Times. 17 MAY 1979 Furthermore, this hotel included festivals and seafood dinners. This place also became a magnet for a criminal named William Marcy \\"Boss\\" Tweed, the notorious Tammany Hall leader, who hid there following his escape in 1875. Boss Tweed had escaped to this place from the Ludlow St. debtor's jail in December 1875 and it was said that Tweed, while heading for Spain, embarked to Cuba aboard a schooner brought to anchor in the bay by his friends The Hotel's owner, Joseph Crocheron, was a well-known and experienced racer of horses along with Cornelius Vanderbilt, August Belmont, and more. There is also a distinct number of Crocheron family members such as John Crocheron, who was a planter, whose will was dated December 13, 1695 and died a year after that date; another was Henry Crocheron (1829-1931), a member of Congress. However, around 1907–08, the hotel was leveled in a fire and was since never rebuilt. After it was burned down in 1908, the community took it upon themselves and raised funds to purchase 42 acres and gave them to the city to become Crocheron Park.

History of GHSU Georgia Health Sciences University was chartered in 1828 by the state of Georgia as the Medical Academy of Georgia to offer a single course of lectures leading to a bachelor's degree. In December 1829, the Georgia General Assembly changed the name to the Medical Institute of Georgia, and again to the Medical College of Georgia in December 1833. City Hospital was the first location of the school on Greene Street, until a move over to The Old Medical College building in 1835 served as the primary home for facilities until 1913. Old Medical College in Augusta, Georgia in 1934, where the Medical College of Georgia's first classes were held The college began with three programs: Anatomy and surgery, institutes and practices of medicine and diseases of women and children, and materia medica, chemistry, and pharmacy. The College of Nursing offered its first classes in the 1940s, and Master's and doctoral programs were first offered in the 1960s. The Colleges of Allied Health Sciences, Dental Medicine and Graduate Studies were added in the next decade, comprising the five schools that made up the University until the 2013 merger. The most recent facilities expansions include the Cancer Research Building opened in 2003; the Health Sciences Building in 2006; and a new dental school building in 2011. In 2011, the University System of Georgia Board of Regents officially changed the name from the Medical College of Georgia to Georgia Health Sciences University, to reflect the university having \\"more than just a medical school\\" as President Ricardo Azziz stated to the Augusta Chronicle. The MCG name became that of the medical school within GHSU, alongside the other four colleges. =Notable accomplishments= Several medical breakthroughs occurred on its campus: *In 1850, the college received national attention when Dr. Paul Eve, a professor of surgery, performed the first hysterectomy in the United States, removing a uterus due to a malignant tumor. Subsequently, he was elected chair of the American Medical Association's committee on surgery. *Dr. William F. Hamilton invented the Hamilton manometer in 1945, which reflected light off a mirror onto photosensitive paper and helped pave the way for Electrocardigram technological advancement. His work also led to Drs. Andre Cournand and Dickenson Richards invented the Cournan catheter, which won the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. In the acceptance speech, Cournand honored Dr. Hamilton by saying in reference to the manometer, \\"…it is well to recall that most of our early knowledge of pressure pulses was obtained by using this.\\" *Two other medical breakthroughs came from Dr. Virgil Sydenstricker, chairmen of the Department of Medicine from 1922–1957. The first, in 1923, was the first documented case of sickle cell disease, with a full autopsy report. The second was a new method of blood transfusion with storied, citrated blood – the precursor to modern blood banks that replaced directly transfusing blood from a donor to a patient. *Once more, a teaching professor put MCG on the map, as Dr. Paul McDonough performed the first prenatal in Georgia in 1965. But that wasn't all – in fact, he discovered a gene protein 23 years later in the adrenal gland that produces too much testosterone, helping a legal mandate for all 50 states be passed to test for congential adrenal hyperplasia, a disorder in newborns. History of ASU Augusta State University traces its roots to 1783, when the Academy of Richmond County was founded as a high school. It opened in 1785 and offered collegiate-level classes from its earliest days, and its classes were overseen by the Georgia General Assembly. Graduates were accepted into colleges as sophomores or juniors. Operation of the academy was overseen by a board of trustees until 1909, when control was passed to the Augusta Board of Education. The college-level classes continued to be overseen by a committee of the state legislature. As enrollment increased, land for a new building was purchased. In 1925, prior to completion of the new building, the Junior College of Augusta was established. In 1957, the junior college separated from the academy and moved to its present location on Walton Way to become Augusta College, now referenced as the Summerville campus. In 1958, the college became a part of the University System of Georgia and its name was formally changed to Augusta College. It remained a two-year college until 1963, when it attained four-year status. A second campus was added on Wrightsboro Road, which still houses athletics, kinesiology and health science, a golf house, and 18-hole golf course. Additional buildings, such as Boykin Wright and Reese Library, were added in the 1980s. In 1996, Augusta College was renamed Augusta State University, and campus continued to expand with the addition of University Hall and a new Science Hall. The name remained until the 2013 consolidation with GHSU. Allgood Hall was part of the major campus expansions on the Augusta State campus. Augusta State was organized into four undergraduate colleges: Katherine Reese Pamplin College of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences, James M. Hull College of Business, the College of Education, and the College of Science and Mathematics. Students could earn associate, bachelor, master, and specialist degrees in over 100 programs of study as well as a paralegal certificate and a cooperative doctorate. There was an Honors Program, as well as a Cooperative Education program in which students alternated between classroom enrollment and real-life work experience in their field of study. Students also had opportunities for internships and study abroad programs. In May 2009 the university hosted the 25th annual National Science Olympiad tournament.

It is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. History In 1881, Phoenix was incorporated as a city. One of the first of several important events which revolutionized the economy of Phoenix was the establishment of a railroad system in the 1880s. Phoenix thus became the most important trade center in Arizona. In 1888, the city offices were moved into a new City Hall, at Washington Street and Central Avenue and in 1889, the territorial capital was moved from the town of Prescott to Phoenix. When the territorial capital was moved from Prescott to Phoenix in 1889 the temporary territorial offices were also located in City Hall. The need for the establishment of hotels and living quarters was apparent. In 1893, Phoenix pioneer and businessman A.D. Walsh had a hotel built in the corner of what is now known as 6th Avenue and Adams Street and named it the 6th Avenue Hotel. The proper address of the building, which originally was a two-story brick Victorian styled structure, is 546 W. Adams Street.\\"Phoenix: Nineteenth Century Architecture\\". Survey by Woodward Architectural Group, June 1991 In 1925, the hotel was renamed the Windsor Hotel. In the 1930s the Windsor went through a remodeling process in which a third story was added. The third story brick structure has a stucco facade on the south and west walls. A front brick addition with casement windows mixed the Victorian architecture with a modern facade. In the 1950s, it was finally renamed the \\"New\\" Windsor Hotel. No longer used as a hotel, it is now a low cost haven for the elderly poor in downtown Phoenix. National Register of Historic Places The Windsor Hotel was added to National Register of Historic Places on September 4, 1985, and its reference number is 85002041.

It charts his attempt to reconnect with his stepbrother, Richard Dart, who had in the summer of 2009 converted to Islam under Anjem Choudary, the leader of now proscribed Islamist group Islam4UK. Leech began filming with Dart just a few months after the conversion and continued up until the moment he left for his first Hajj, late in 2010. The film presents a rare insight into the world of Islamic fundamentalism, the young men caught up in it, and the devastating effect it has on families. First aired on BBC Three in April 2011, My Brother the Islamist has since been broadcast across the world, in countries including Australia, Austria, Canada, Germany, Japan, New Zealand and the USA. The Metro described the film as \\"...an object lesson in objective filmmaking\\".

The game differs from most war-themed video games by focusing on the civilian experience of war rather than front line combat. Characters have to make many difficult decisions in order to survive everyday dangers. There are various endings for each character, depending on the decisions made in the game. This War of Mine was released for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux in November 2014. The Android port was released on July 14, 2015, followed by the iOS port on the following day (July 15). An expansion pack called This War of Mine: The Little Ones was released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on January 29, 2016, and on June 1, 2016 for Windows. A version of the game that includes all the content entitled This War Of Mine: Complete Edition was released for the Nintendo Switch on November 27, 2018. Gameplay This War of Mine is a survival-themed strategy game where the player controls a group of civilian survivors in a makeshift shelter in the besieged, war-torn fictional city of Pogoren, Graznavia. The main goal of the game is to survive the war with the tools and materials the player can gather with the characters they control. Most of the characters under the player's control have no military background nor any kind of survival experience, and will require constant intervention by the player in order to stay alive. It is the player's responsibility to maintain their characters' health, hunger and mood levels until the declaration of a ceasefire, which occurs after a randomized duration. During the daytime, hostile snipers will prevent the survivors from venturing outside, thereby offering the player time to craft tools from gathered materials, trade, upgrade the shelter, cook food and heal the survivors. At night, the player is given the opportunity to venture out and scavenge nearby areas for valuable resources for their everyday survival. During their excursions, the player- controlled survivors can encounter other NPC survivors of the war, who they can choose to help with gifts of food or medicine, or rob and kill. The player can also build a radio inside their shelter, which will provide useful information such as weather warnings, updates on the city's economy and news of the ongoing war effort to help the player plan appropriate shelter upgrades and scavenging missions. The player starts off with one to four survivors whose actions the player can affect. The actions the player makes will change the type of endings each survivor has. Each character has one or two traits that helps/hinders the player, besides hidden, varying stats that affect combat, movement speed, and so on. Some traits are useful during certain days while others are useful all the time. For example, one character named Bruno has a trait called \\"Good Cook\\", which helps the player use less fuel and water when cooking meals. There are a total of 12 playable characters. The Little Ones DLC includes the possibility of adding an extra, a child survivor, that can not defend him/herself or perform any of the tasks needed to maintain the shelter at first. In addition, the child survivor must be given constant attention to prevent it from being depressed, but can be taught by the other survivors to perform small chores like cooking, filtering water or growing crops, and once bonding with an adult, it can sleep with them in the same bed at night, dispensing the need of a separate bed for both. Development The game was inspired by the poor living conditions and wartime atrocities that Bosnian civilians endured during the 1992–96 Siege of Sarajevo, the longest city siege since World War II. In November 2014, unlicensed copies of the game were made available online. The developer's response was to post a number of working Steam keys, encouraging downloaders to share them with friends, and buy the game if their financial situation allowed. =Post-release= A scenario editor was added into the game through update 1.3, which allows players to create and select survivors. The editor also allows environmental conditions and the length of conflicts to be changed. Player-created content was released freely via the Steam Workshop as of update 2.0. To celebrate the game's third anniversary, 11 bit Studios released the first of three story- driven DLC's; Fathers Promise on November 14, 2017. The second story DLC, The Last Broadcast, was released on November 14, 2018. In November 2018, 11 bit studios announced This War Of Mine: Complete Edition exclusively for the Nintendo Switch, releasing later the same month. This version compiles all the content in a single package, including the original base game, the Anniversary Edition content, The Little Ones, and its episodic DLC follow-ups Fathers Promise, The Last Broadcast, and Fading Embers. A physical retail version of the game will be available in Europe for the Nintendo Switch on its worldwide launch day, courtesy of Deep Silver. Reception The iOS version of This War of Mine received \\"universal acclaim\\", while the PC and console versions received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. The Digital Fix gave the PC version nine out of ten and said, \\"Whether you choose to perceive it through a moral lens or not, there’s a great tactical survival mechanic driving this game beneath the didactics. Although the events it depicts are depressing to contemplate at length, I found myself coming back again and again to try and get it right somehow, beat the odds, and save my people.\\" The same website also gave the PlayStation 4 version of The Little Ones eight out of ten and said, \\"While better on PC, the PS4 release brings this remarkable game to a new crowd.\\" 411Mania gave the Xbox One version 8.5 out of 10 and said that it was \\"not a game I will recommend if you like settling down for a visceral experience, or earning XP, or shooting stuff dead. It's not fast paced. It's not much fun to actually play. It'll make you feel terrible about your actions at almost every turn. But in spite of all that, there is something so essential about this gaming experience that I urge you to give this game a try.\\" Digital Spy gave the PC version four stars out of five and said that the \\"earnest human touch keeps This War of Mine compelling even when you mess up and the rubble all comes tumbling down around you, leaving you just enough hope for the next attempt that you'll dive back in and endure it all again.\\" Metro UK gave the PS4 version seven out of ten and called it \\"A daring, and largely successful, attempt to show the civilian side of war, that succeeds as an interactive drama even when it occasionally fails as a game.\\" However, Slant Magazine gave the same console version two stars out of five and said that the game \\"seems interested only in presenting a near-pornographic level of human despair in a warped attempt at edifying players.\\" The game reportedly made back its development costs in its first two days for sale, and had sold over 4.5 million units by April 2019. A Cooperative board game version was released in 2017 by Galakta in cooperation with 11-bit studios. Impact In 2020, the Polish Chancellery of the Prime Minister announced that This War of Mine will be added to the recommended reading list in Polish high schools during the academic year of 2020-2021. This is the first initiative in the world to add a video game to recommended readings in school.

Born in Marseille, where he studied drawing and sculpting at the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture while apprenticed to a potter. After a stay in Rome where he won a Prix de Rome, he returned to France and sculpted the funeral monument of Bishop Inguimbert (1774), which was placed in the choir of the chapel of the Hôtel-Dieu of Carpentras. He then received an annuity granted by the city of Montpellier to execute for them a fountain of The Three Graces (1776) in Place de la Comédie. He then moved to Paris where he married and returned to Marseille. Misfortunes soon hit the artist: his wife died, and the city of Montpellier stopped paying him his pension. In 1799 he was admitted to the Académie de Marseille. Dantoine executed exhibitions between 1800-1803 with a draft public monument representing Languedoc in the form of a connecting Engineering Ocean and the Mediterranean, an allusion to the channel and the two seas. He also presented a globe of the world upon which Justice, Wisdom and Prudence presided. In 1806 he sculpted the cenotaph of General Desaix, consisting of a marble urn on the top of a granite column, which now resides at Château Borély.

History The Harvard-Radcliffe Program in Business Administration began in March 1937, as an eleven-month course Training Course in Personnel Administration, intended to prepare Radcliffe College alums for careers after graduation. From its earliest days, the program included two periods of field work, in which students worked in factories or in stores or business offices. The first class consisted of only five students and the original focus was on work in the field of education. The program was founded by Edith Stedman, director of Radcliffe College's Appointment Bureau; Stedman also served as the program's first director. In 1941, Anne Hood Harken took over as director; during her tenure, the program underwent significant changes, partly prompted by the exigencies of World War II and the increased opportunities for women to hold personnel jobs in industry and government. The program expanded to offer courses on administrative problems in industry; these classes, taught by the faculty of the Harvard Business School, had earlier only been given to men. Enrollment increased significantly with this new approach, with the class size growing to 30 students. In 1944, T. North Whitehead became director. After World War II, to reflect the program's broader scope, its name was changed to the Management Training Program. Enrollment spiked briefly after World War II but began declining in the early 1950s. At this point the program was also running a deficit, and in 1951 the president and council of Harvard voted to discontinue the program in 1953. Harvard Business School agreed to take over the educational portion of the program as well as the financial responsibilities, with Radcliffe providing housing and classrooms and handling administrative functions. To cement this agreement, the program's name was changed to the Harvard-Radcliffe Program in Business Administration in 1956. However, the program offered by the Management Training Program differed significantly from the two-year program offered to men in the Business School; the Radcliffe Program lasted only one year and did not award degrees. Dudley Meek served as director from 1955 to 1958 and oversaw a revision of the curriculum, which was redesigned to be broader in scope. In 1959, with enrollment in the program dropping and with increasing pressure to enroll women in the Business School, the faculty voted to admit graduates of the Harvard-Radcliffe Program to the second year of the MBA program. In 1962, a committee appointed by the Dean of the Business School recommended that the Harvard-Radcliffe program be discontinued. In December of that year, the faculty accepted the committee's recommendation and also voted to accept women into the full MBA program.

The ships were built at the Brodogradilište specijalnih objekata shipyard in Split with slight differences in armament configuration between the last two ships. By the time the Croatian War of Independence started, one ship was in service with the JRM while another was being completed. The one in JRM service was relocated to Montenegro where it would be commissioned with the Navy of the new FR Yugoslavia. The second ship that was captured unfinished was completed by Croatian forces and entered service with the HRM, followed by a third that was laid down by Croatia in 1993. The two ships commissioned with the HRM remain in active service, providing assistance to civilian institutions aside from their regular military tasks. The first ship in the class is currently decommissioned and in reserve in the Bay of Kotor, Montenegro.  Development and building  The Silba class was developed by the Brodarski institut (BI) from Zagreb as a replacement for a large number of aging barge-like landing craft based on German World War II designs (Marinefährprahm and Siebel). All three ships were completed at the Brodogradilište specijalnih objekata (BSO) in Split, Croatia. The first one, Krk (DBM-241), was commissioned with the JRM sometime between 1986 and 1990. The keel for the second ship that was to be named Rab (DBM-242) was laid down in 1990. As the Croatian War of Independence started, unfinished Rab was captured by Croatian forces. It was completed and launched as Cetina (DBM-81) on 18 July 1992. A third and final ship was launched on 17 September 1994 as Krka (DBM-82).  Description  These ferry-like ships feature a roll-on/roll-off design with two loading ramps located on the bow and the stern. Measuring in length, they have a beam with a draft. Propulsion consists of two Burmeister & Wain Alpha Diesel 10V 23L VO engines mounted on two shafts, enabling them a maximum speed of and a cruising speed of . Traveling at their cruise speed they have a range of with a 12-day endurance. The ships are manned by a crew of 32. The Armament configuration differs between the first two ships and the last one; DBM-241 and DBM-81 are armed with two AK-230 CIWS mounted on the sides, a single quadruple M-75 gun on the stern and a single quadruple MTU-4 9K32M Strela-2M (SA-7b \\"Grail\\") anti-aircraft missile launcher. The interior, which features two mine rails, can be used to carry up to 152 different naval mines, six medium tanks or 300 troops with equipment, a total cargo capacity of . DBM-82 was completed with a different gun armament; in place of the AK-230, DBM-82 has two 20 mm M-71 guns on the sides and a single Bofors D70 gun on the bow. The ship was also completed as an auxiliary water carrier with a capacity of around of fresh water. The number of mines that DBM-82 can carry is a maximum of 114.

DBM-242, now redesignated as DBM-81 was launched as Cetina and entered service with the Croatian Navy 19 February 1992 with Ivo Raffanelli in command. For the remainder of the war, Cetina was engaged in transporting troops and equipment along the coast, including supply runs for Croatian forces during Operation Maslenica in 1993. The same year the ship participated in testing of the new MNS-M90 naval mine. DBM-82, the third and final ship of the class, was commissioned with the Croatian Navy on 9 March 1995 with Jerko Bošnjak in command. According to publications and news reports, DBM-241 was reported operational as late as 2005. An article published in October 2012 reported that the Egyptian Navy bought DBM-241 a year earlier. Although the advance was paid, the official handover of the ship has not happened by the time the article was published. As of March 2014, the official website of the Armed Forces of Montenegro does not list DBM-241 among its fleet: the ship is currently in reserve in the Bay of Kotor, opposite Đenovići. The two Silba- class in Croatian hands continue to see service the Navy Flotilla performing traditional naval tasks as well as support missions for civilian institutions such water supply and transporting firefighters. Cetina and Krka in Rijeka, 2009 In July 2006 Krka was damaged during an overhaul at the Šibenik Shipyard. While being lowered to the sea, the winch of the syncrolift pulled out of the concrete causing the ship to fall down, creating a hole in the hull and sinking the stern. Early reports of significant damage proved to be false and the ship was repaired soon after. Out of ten crew members that were on board at the time, only one sustained minor injuries. In 2015, Krka and Cetina were tasked with transporting Croatian Army vehicles and personnel to Spain for the NATO \\"Trident Juncture\\" exercise. The ships departed the Lora Naval Base on 11 October 2015, loaded with four Patria AMVs, two trucks, one motor vehicle and 14 soldiers scheduled to take part in the exercise. On 13 October they arrived in Catania where they rendezvoused with Andrija Mohorovičić deployed in support of Operation Triton. The two ships made another stop at Cagliari before continuing to Spain, arriving in Sagunto on 18 October after spending seven days at sea. The ships returned to the Lora Naval Base on 13 November, concluding their month long deployment during which they traversed a total of .

He is known for his work on net zero energy and net zero water buildings and for the rehabilitation of the oldest home in North America to achieve net zero energy. Grocoff is a contributor to the radio show The Environment Report produced by Michigan Radio (part of the NPR network), FOX News Energy Team, and was host of GreenovationTV. He advocates for modernized distributed renewable energy networks and distributed water and wastewater systems that work with natural systems.  Living Community Challenge, Veridian at County Farm  Grocoff is developing one of the world's first projects to register for the Living Community Challenge. Veridian at County Farm is repurposing the site of a former youth prison adjacent to the 130 acre County Farm Park in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Living Community Challenge is a certification of the International Living Future Institute intended to bring the Living Building ChallengeLiving Building Challenge to the community scale. The development is targeted to be a mixed-income net zero energy community: 100% all-electric, powered by solar, with resilient energy storage and no gas lines or combustion appliances. Veridian at County Farm was among 100 projects worldwide highlighted in the Local Projects Challenge at the 2020 World Urban Forum 10 in Abu Dhabi as part of the United Nations program for Accelerating the UN Sustainable Development Goals.  Mission Zero House  Grocoff first gained national attention for the rehabilitation of his Victorian-era Mission Zero house in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Built in 1901, the home is considered the oldest home in America to achieve net zero energy. The Atlantic Magazine called the work \\"sustainable perfection\\". The home is featured on the cover of the book No Regrets Remodeling: How to Create a Comfortable, Healthy Home That Saves Energy. In 2013, Grocoff and his company THRIVE partnered with BLUElab from the University of Michigan College of Engineering and offered his home as community testbed for net zero water and restoration of ecological water flow to pre-development conditions. The project is the first Cold Climate home certified as a Net Zero Energy Building under the Living Building Challenge, which is based on actual rather than anticipated performance. Grocoff calls the home \\"Mission Zero House\\" in honor of Ray Anderson, founder and chairman of Interface, Inc., who, in 1994, pledged that his multi-national carpet company would meet a \\"Mission Zero\\" goal to eliminate any negative impact it may have on the environment by the year 2020.  Recognition  In 2012, Grocoff was awarded Michigan Green Leader by the Detroit Free Press. USA Today honored him with a Best Green Home of 2010. MyFORD Magazine selected Grocoff as the #1 Electric Innovator. Grocoff received the first Net Zero Hero Award from the Green Home Institute.

Cooper (2012), part of level 8 by Almkvist and Guillera (2012), part of level 10 by Y. Yang, and the rest by H. H. Chan and S. Cooper. The notation jn(τ) is derived from Zagier and Tn refers to the relevant McKay–Thompson series. Level 1 Examples for levels 1–4 were given by Ramanujan in his 1917 paper. Given q=e^{2\\\\pi i \\\\tau} as in the rest of this article. Let, :\\\\begin{align} j(\\\\tau) &= \\\\Big(\\\\tfrac{E_4(\\\\tau)}{\\\\eta^8(\\\\tau)}\\\\Big)^3 = \\\\tfrac{1}{q} + 744 + 196884q + 21493760q^2 +\\\\dots j^*(\\\\tau) &= 432\\\\,\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{j(\\\\tau)}+ \\\\sqrt{j(\\\\tau)-1728}}{\\\\sqrt{j(\\\\tau)}- \\\\sqrt{j(\\\\tau)-1728}} = \\\\tfrac{1}{q} - 120 + 10260q - 901120q^2 + \\\\dots \\\\end{align} with the j-function j(τ), Eisenstein series E4, and Dedekind eta function η(τ). The first expansion is the McKay–Thompson series of class 1A () with a(0) = 744. Note that, as first noticed by J. McKay, the coefficient of the linear term of j(τ) almost equals 196883, which is the degree of the smallest nontrivial irreducible representation of the Monster group. Similar phenomena will be observed in the other levels. Define :s_{1A}(k)=\\\\tbinom{2k}{k}\\\\tbinom{3k}{k}\\\\tbinom{6k}{3k}=1, 120, 83160, 81681600,\\\\dots () :s_{1B}(k)=\\\\sum_{j=0}^k\\\\tbinom{2j}{j}\\\\tbinom{3j}{j}\\\\tbinom{6j}{3j}\\\\tbinom{k+j}{k-j}(-432)^{k-j} =1, -312, 114264, -44196288,\\\\dots Then the two modular functions and sequences are related by :\\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty s_{1A}(k)\\\\,\\\\frac{1}{(j(\\\\tau))^{k+1/2}}= \\\\pm \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty s_{1B}(k)\\\\,\\\\frac{1}{(j^*(\\\\tau))^{k+1/2}} if the series converges and the sign chosen appropriately, though squaring both sides easily removes the ambiguity. Analogous relationships exist for the higher levels. Examples: :\\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi} = 12\\\\,\\\\boldsymbol{i}\\\\,\\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty s_{1A}(k)\\\\,\\\\frac{163\\\\cdot3344418k+13591409}{(-640320^3)^{k+1/2}},\\\\quad j\\\\Big(\\\\tfrac{1+\\\\sqrt{-163}}{2}\\\\Big)=-640320^3 :\\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi} = 24\\\\,\\\\boldsymbol{i}\\\\,\\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty s_{1B}(k)\\\\,\\\\frac{-3669+320\\\\sqrt{645}\\\\,(k+\\\\tfrac{1}{2})}{\\\\big({-432}\\\\,U_{645}^3\\\\big)^{k+1/2}},\\\\quad j^*\\\\Big(\\\\tfrac{1+\\\\sqrt{-43}}{2}\\\\Big) = -432\\\\,U_{645}^{3}=-432\\\\Big(\\\\tfrac{127+5\\\\sqrt{645}}{2}\\\\Big)^{3} and U_n is a fundamental unit. The first belongs to a family of formulas which were rigorously proven by the Chudnovsky brothers in 1989. and later used to calculate 10 trillion digits of π in 2011.. The second formula, and the ones for higher levels, was established by H.H. Chan and S. Cooper in 2012. Level 2 Using Zagier's notation for the modular function of level 2, :\\\\begin{align} j_{2A}(\\\\tau) &=\\\\Big(\\\\big(\\\\tfrac{\\\\eta(\\\\tau)}{\\\\eta(2\\\\tau)}\\\\big)^{12}+2^6 \\\\big(\\\\tfrac{\\\\eta(2\\\\tau)}{\\\\eta(\\\\tau)}\\\\big)^{12}\\\\Big)^2 = \\\\tfrac{1}{q} + 104 + 4372q + 96256q^2 + 1240002q^3+\\\\cdots  j_{2B}(\\\\tau) &= \\\\big(\\\\tfrac{\\\\eta(\\\\tau)}{\\\\eta(2\\\\tau)}\\\\big)^{24} = \\\\tfrac{1}{q} - 24 + 276q - 2048q^2 + 11202q^3 - \\\\cdots \\\\end{align} Note that the coefficient of the linear term of j2A(τ) is one more than 4371 which is the smallest degree > 1 of the irreducible representations of the Baby Monster group. Define, :s_{2A}(k)=\\\\tbinom{2k}{k}\\\\tbinom{2k}{k}\\\\tbinom{4k}{2k}=1, 24, 2520, 369600, 63063000,\\\\dots () :s_{2B}(k)=\\\\sum_{j=0}^k\\\\tbinom{2j}{j}\\\\tbinom{2j}{j}\\\\tbinom{4j}{2j}\\\\tbinom{k+j}{k-j}(-64)^{k-j}=1, -40, 2008, -109120, 6173656,\\\\dots Then, :\\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty s_{2A}(k)\\\\,\\\\frac{1}{(j_{2A}(\\\\tau))^{k+1/2}}= \\\\pm \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty s_{2B}(k)\\\\,\\\\frac{1}{(j_{2B}(\\\\tau))^{k+1/2}} if the series converges and the sign chosen appropriately.

The story is about a group of black friends who are actors, musicians, and performers. In a series of dreamlike vignettes and poetic monologues, they commiserate about the difficulties they face as black artists. The piece is framed by the narrator, lou, a magician who wants to use his magic to help the characters come to terms with their blackness and rejoice in their identities: \\"i'm fixin you up good/ fixin you up good & colored / & you gonna be colored all yr life / & you gonna love it/ bein colored/ all yr life/ colored & love it / love it/ bein colored. SPELL #7.\\" The set design calls for a \\"huge black-face mask\\" to dominate the stage, and minstrel masks are worn in the opening. These images put frustrations of the characters in conversation with the history of racism in theater, as the images of \\"grotesque, larger than life misrepresentation\\" call forth minstrel shows and Blackface. spell #7 culminates in a repetition of lou's refrain, with all the cast members singing together. Performance and publication history spell #7 was first produced It was also produced at Crossroads Theatre (New Jersey) under the direction of Dean Irby and choreography by Dyane Harvey-Salaam. In 1979 as part of Joseph Papp's New York Shakespeare Festival it was restaged. It was directed by Oz Scott and choreographed by Dianne McIntyre, with original music by David Murray and Butch Morris. The cast included Mary Alice, Avery Brooks, LaTanya Richardson, Reyno, Dyane Harvey-Salaam, Larry Marshall, Laurie Carlos and Ellis E. Williams. During the play's run Samuel L. Jackson and Jack Landron also made appearances. It first opened as a free workshop, under the title Spell #7: A Geechee Quick Magic Trance Manual. After receiving good reviews the production was moved up to the Anspacher Stage at The Public Theater. natalie's sharp monologue in the final act about her hypothetical life as a white woman was cut from this revised version, and Shange herself acted in a scene as sue- jean, a conflicted and violent mother. Her performance had \\"an unforgettable quality of coming from inside.\\" After the New York run, spell #7 went on to be performed by other companies. Some productions include one in 1982 at Clark College, another in 1982 during the Philadelphia Black Theater Festival, one in 1986 from the Avante Theater Company in Philadelphia, a 1991 performance at the Studio Theatre (Washington, D.C.), and a 1996 production at Spelman College. The choreopoem was published in 1981 in Three Pieces, a collection of Shange's theater works. In addition to spell #7, the book contains a photograph: lovers in motion and boogie woogie landscapes, and a foreword written by Shange. spell #7 was also printed in the 1986 anthology 9 Plays by Black Women, alongside works by Beah Richards, Lorraine Hansberry, and Alice Childress, among others. Both of these versions restore the natalie monologue that was cut from the Anspacher performance. Style Like Shange's more well known choreopoem For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf, spell #7 makes use of non-standard grammar and eschews generally accepted rules of capitalization and punctuation. The most recent editions of Three Pieces do not capitalize the title of the choreopoem or any of the names of the characters. Though the piece follows the structure of a three-act play, it utilizes elements that are uncommon in most modern traditional dramas, such as extended monologues. The story takes place in a bar, and the setting does not change. Most of the action unfolds indirectly, when the characters narrate stories about themselves and their friends, and occasionally they take on multiple personas at once. In the foreword to Three Pieces Shange explains why she avoids more traditional methods of playwriting, citing motivations related to her Black identity. \\"For too long now\\" she says \\"Afro-Americans have been duped by the same artificial aesthetics that plague our white counterparts/ \\"the perfect play,\\" as we know it to be/ a truly European framework for European psychology/ cannot function efficiently for those of us from this hemisphere.\\" Characters In order of appearance, the characters are: * lou, a magician * alec, an actor * dahlia, a young singer and dancer * eli, a bartender * bettina, dahlia's fellow chorus dancer * lily, an out-of-work actress working in the bar * natalie, an unsuccessful performer * ross, a guitar player and singer * maxine, an actress Critical reception Many responses to spell #7 praise its poetic language and emotional depth. One reviewer called Shange's words \\"lyrical, wry, painful, and comically prosaic by turn.\\" Another reviewer wrote that Shange is \\"incredible in her uncanny ability to capture the precision and intensity of the moment,\\" but then went on to criticize her style for being \\"distracting and predictable.\\" In a 1980 addition to the foreword, Shange writes about one reviewer, who criticized her for writing \\"with intentions of outdoing the white man in the acrobatic distortions of English.\\" In reply, Shange says that he \\"waz absolutely correct,\\" she, in writing spell #7 aimed to \\"attack deform n maim the language that i waz taught to hate myself in...i haveta fix my tool to my needs/ i have to take it apart to the bone/ so that the malignancies/ fall away/ leaving us a space to literally create our own image.\\"  References   External Link  Ntozake Shange Papers, 1966-2016; Barnard Archives and Special Collections, Barnard Library, Barnard College.

Krejci was born on 13 February 1916 in Polešovice, Austria-Hungary (the present-day Czech Republic). He studied law. Krejci's father, Jaroslav Krejčí, held office as the Prime Minister of the German- occupied Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia from 1942 to 1945. In contrast to his father's collaboration, Jaroslav Krejci opposed the German occupation of Czechoslovakia and became actively involved in the Czech resistance during World War II. Krejci joined the Josef Hlavka National Economic Institute after the end of the war. He openly opposed the merger of the Czechoslovak Social Democratic Party, to which he was a member, into Communist Party of Czechoslovakia following the 1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état. In 1954, he was sentenced to ten years in prison on charges of treason for his opposition to the Communist Party. He was released from prison in 1960 as part of an amnesty. He and his wife immigrated to the United Kingdom following the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, which had crushed the Prague Spring. Krejci became a professor of sociology at Lancaster University. He taught in the university's Departments of French Studies, German Studies and Religious Studies from 1969 until 1983. Much of his research focused on history and the formation of civilization from a macrosociological approach. He returned to Czechoslovakia and the Czech Republic following the fall of communism to teach at Charles University in Prague and Palacký University, Olomouc, as well as the Diplomatic Academy of Vienna.

The resort has been continuously operated as a hot spring resort since the early 1900s. The Calistoga Spa Hot Springs is located at 1006 Washington Street and bordered by Gerard Street to the Northwest and Franklin Street to the Southeast.  Area history  The indigenous Wappo civilization occupied the region for thousands of years and annually migrated to the upper valley to village near the exposed mineral pools found along the western ridge of the Mayacamas mountain range. Geothermal forces and tectonic activity elevate the temperature of the mineral water to 180 degrees Fahrenheit at the source.  Volcanic ash mud baths and balneotherapy  A mud bath is a bath of mud, commonly from areas where hot springs water can combine with volcanic ash. The volcanic ash found in the upper Napa Valley is derived from the eruptions of Mount Konocti and Mount St. Helena ending some 10,000 years ago. Mud baths have existed for thousands of years and since ancient times have been used to treat health problems and beautify the skin. Balneology or sometimes referred to as \\"taking in the waters\\" is an ancient method of gaining the benefits of mineral water through immersion, ingestion and contact with the water over a period of time. It is believed that the mineral content within the water, especially magnesium, initiates a calming effect on the user. The spa property  From 1965 through 1986 the property operated Calistoga's largest open to the public pool, the Roman Pool. Through vigorous use and age the pool fell into decline and was closed in 1985. Between 1965 and 1985 several new guest room buildings were added to the property to allow for more overnight visitors wanting to \\"take in the waters\\".Original Roman Pool In 1986 a new main building was constructed to house the spa, mud bath and mineral bath facility. This building rests upon the space previously occupied by the Roman Pool. The pools and surrounding patio areas were improved and barbecue areas were created for guests to use during their visit. In 2014 four new mineral pools were added.

It was released in the Nintendo eShop in Japan on 12 March 2014, in Europe on 13 March 2014, in Australia on 14 March 2014, and in North America on 20 March 2014. The game includes all 718 Pokémon that were known at the time. Gameplay The player battles a water-type Pokémon using grass-type ones. The gameplay of Pokémon Battle Trozei is similar to the Japanese mobile game Puzzle & Dragons. In the game, players engage in a Pokémon battle depicted on the top screen of the handheld device. To battle the enemy Pokémon, players create groups of three or more identical Pokémon icons on the grid in the bottom screen. The battles are fought using a rock-paper-scissors style system where each Pokémon has different elemental types assigned to it, and the outcome is based on the strengths and weaknesses that these types have on each other. This mechanic of elemental strengths and weaknesses borrows from the main Pokémon role-playing games. This is the first Pokémon puzzle game to borrow rules from the main series. In addition to the matching mechanic, the game requires strategy when considering which Pokémon types to use in battle. This strategy element puts players that are unfamiliar with the Pokémon series at a disadvantage because they may not know the element types of each of the game's 718 Pokémon. The game supports cooperative multiplayer for up to four players. The game features the same Pokémon from Pokémon Trozei! but also features Pokémon from Sinnoh, Unova and Kalos, except Diancie, Hoopa and Volcanion. Development The game was revealed on 13 February 2014 in a Nintendo Direct, and was released in the Nintendo eShop in Japan on 12 March 2014, in Europe on 13 March 2014, in Australia on 14 March 2014, and in North America on 20 March 2014. The game includes all 718 Pokémon that were known at the time. A Nintendo 3DS XL game system with a decorative Pokémon Battle Trozei theme was released in Japan, but the special edition handheld was only given to winners of competitions held by the Pokémon Daisuki Club, a Japanese club for Pokémon fans. Upon the game's release, customers in Japan could also purchase a set of kuji cards which came with a chance to win a Trozei themed cushion, mug, pencil case, or other item. The Japanese Pokémon Center also had Trozei merchandise for sale including stickers, jigsaw puzzles, and notebooks. Reception The game received average reviews upon release, garnering a score of 70 out of 100 on the review aggregation website Metacritic. IGN reviewer Scott Thompson commended the game for using the strategic combat system from the Pokémon RPG series rather than simply creating a puzzle game with a Pokémon theme. He praised the game's local cooperative multiplayer as well; however, he did note that the user interface for the game lacked sufficient details for players not familiar with every Pokémon type. Kinja.com criticized the game's lack of online multiplayer and its ho-hum music, but praised its solid gameplay mechanics and art style.

Biography He was the son of Danush and Maruccia whom arrived in Monopoli from Durrës after the fall of Constantinople to the Turks (1453). He achieved the title of sub- diaconate in 1508, and was a Canonical of the Cathedral of Monopoli from 1533. In the following years he was given the office of Prothonotary apostolic by Pope Pius IV. He was trained culturally in the quadrivium, and in 1532 has compiled an Antiphonary (of processional type) where, in addition to well- known songs from the Gregorian repertoire, he put some his short compositions monophonic closely linked to the cult practiced in the Renaissance in Monopoli. This was discovered in the late 1970s and published by eminent musicologist Domenico Morgante in various studies since 1981. This precious parchment is the oldest Italo-Albanian music source and testifies to the existence of a profitable cultural \\"contamination\\" between the two sides of the Adriatic Sea. In 1542 he edited, at the publisher Sultzbach in Naples, an important treatise on Arithmetic and Geometry which was reprinted almost without interruption until the late Eighteenth century (1566, 1569, 1575, 1590, 1601, 1723, 1727, 1784). The presence of his family, owner of jus patronatus in the ancient Church of St. Peter, is documented in Monopoli at least until the first half of the Eighteenth century. His original surname in Albanian language (Lapazaya) appears, both in handwritten documents in the archive, both in printed works, in a rich variety of form: Lapizzaya, Lapizzaglia, Lapizzaga, Lapezzaja, etc. The City of Monopoli has dedicated him a street not far from the Cathedral, and his marble bust stands in the entrance to the Council Chamber of the City of Durrës.

It is accredited by The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB), and has been named one of the top business schools in the country by The Princeton Review multiple times. History The school’s beginnings can be traced to a Board of Regents decision to allow a degree in Business Administration to be awarded to Augusta College upon the school’s successful transition to a four-year college in 1963. Eight years later, the college was allowed to offer its first MBA, and the School of Business Administration became official, earning a name change to the College of Business Administration in 1996 when Augusta College’s name changed to Augusta State University. In 2006, James Hull, owner of one of the United States’ largest shopping mall developers, made a donation of $2 million to the University specifically earmarked for the College of Business. In response, school officials renamed the college to its current name to honor the investment, which was the largest in then-Augusta State University’s history.

She qualified for the 2014 Winter Paralympics competing for Team USA and won a bronze in the standing Super-G and Super combined.  Personal history  Stephanie Jallen was born on 13 February 1996 in Kingston, Pennsylvania. Jallen was born with CHILD syndrome, Congenital Hemidysplasia with Ichthyosis and Limb Defects Syndrome. This meant that Jallen's left leg had to be amputated, her left side is under-developed, and she suffers from rashes. Her nickname, Hopper, comes from the fact that when her prosthetic limbs weren't being worn, she had to hop. Jallen has always been active and learned to play soccer with her friends. She does have a crutch but she uses it mainly for balance and is happy to stand or move around on her leg. In an interview she said that she would not want to have her limbs back to normal as that would just make her \\"boring\\". Jallen is studying at King's College in hopes of earning a business degree.  Career  Jallen was introduced to skiing at a 2006 winter ski clinic in Pennsylvania. Her international debut was in 2011. In that year, she was the US slalom champion after coming first in the event. She has encouraged Iraq war amputees and when she was eleven in 2007 she spoke at Harrisburg to the Pennsylvania senate and told them not to give up. In 2012, she \\"lacerated\\" her face in Kimberley, British Columbia in a Super-G event. The resulting wound needed twelve facial stitches. She also fractured her tibia plateau and partly tore a knee ligament. Jallen has also suffered head and back injuries, as well as undergone surgeries to the knee and ankle. = Paralympics = At her début Paralympics, the 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi, Jallen competed for Team USA in three events: the Super-G, the slalom, and the super combined (Jallen is competing in standing in all events). She was the second-youngest member of the national team. She came third in the Super-G, finishing 5.94 seconds behind Marie Bochet; also finishing behind Solène Jambaqué, both of France. Jallen came third in the super combined with a time of 1:25.15 seconds, 4.74 seconds behind Bochet, who won. However, Jallen did not finish the slalom and fell in the giant slalom.

Biography Luigi Ferdinando Tagliavini studied organ, piano and composition with Riccardo Nielsen at the Conservatorio Giovanni Battista Martini in Bologna and at the Conservatory in Paris with Marcel Dupré. He graduated at the University of Padua in 1951 with a dissertation on the texts of the sacred cantatas of Johann Sebastian Bach; he taught organ at Bologna Conservatory where he also held the post of librarian; he became lecturer and later professor of organ at the Monteverdi Conservatory in Bolzano. He was appointed to teach music history at the University of Parma and in 1971 he was appointed as Professor and as Director of the Institute of Musicology at the University of Freiburg (Switzerland). He was guest professor at various universities in the U.S.A.; he was widely active as a concert organist in Italy and abroad. Together with Liuwe Tamminga he was appointed as organist at the Basilica of San Petronio in Bologna. Together with Renato Lunelli he founded the journal \\"L'organo\\" in 1960, continued together with Oscar Mischiati and still running today. He taught regularly at the summer courses at Haarlem, Netherlands and at the course the \\"Academy of Organ Music\\" at Pistoia. Together with Marie-Claire Alain, Anton Heiller and Gustav Leonhardt, he made a considerable contribution to the rediscovery and promotion of historical performance practice on the Baroque organ and also the harpsichord. Together with his good friend and colleague Oscar Mischiati he is seen to have been the first promoter of the historical organ movement in Italy. This movement was and is concerned with the restoration of historical organs using old methods and techniques, reestablishing the original value of the instruments and enabling them to be appreciated. Some of the restorations guided by the movement, in particular those of the two organs in the Basilica San Petronio in Bologna, one (1471–75) by Lorenzo da Prato and (1531) Giovan Battista Fachinetti, and the other (1596) by Baldassarre Malamini, have contributed to a new awareness of historical organs in Italy and a new consciousness of their extraordinary value. Among the most successful concert organists of his generation, he not only performed on the most important organs in Italy but also those elsewhere in Europe. He made a number of recordings and received several awards including the \\"Premio della discografia Italiana\\", the \\"Schallplattenpreis Phono-Akademie der Deutschen,\\" the distinction \\"Choc de la musique\\" for the CD dedicated to Andrea Gabrieli and Giovanni Gabrieli made with Liuwe Tamminga on the organs of San Petronio and the \\"Premio Antonio Vivaldi\\" and the \\"Premio Massimo Mila\\". Honours bestowed on him include the Tiroler Adler-Orden in Gold conferred in Innsbruck in 1982, an honorary doctorate in music from the University of Edinburgh, an honorary fellowship of the Royal College of Organists in London in 1996, an honorary degree from the University of Bologna in the disciplines of the arts, music and entertainment in 1999, and an honorary doctorate in sacred music from the Pontifical Institute of Sacred Music in Rome (2011). During his life he assembled a unique collection of musical instruments from the sixteenth to the twentieth century. These comprise about 70 instruments, half of which are of the harpsichord family. The others not only include clavichords, pianos and organs but also wind instruments and automatic musical instruments. The collection, together with a large library, he recently donated to the Foundation of the Cassa di Risparmio in Bologna and is displayed in the buildings and Church of San Colombano, Bologna. The aims of the gift, to perpetuate, display and enlarge the collection are matched by study facilities in the library, guided tours through the collection, a continuing programme of restoration and conservation of the instruments in the workshop on the premises, conferences on related themes and concerts on the instruments. The most important instruments include a spinet of about 1540 attributed to Alesandro Trasuntino, a harpsichord by Giovanni Battista Giusti of 1679, a harpsichord by Fabio da Bologna of 1686 and a combination of a harpsichord and a piano with two keyboards, one for the hammers, the other for the plectra, by Giovanni Ferrini of 1746. He frequently sat on juries for competitions at home and abroad, for instance in 1991 and 1994 when he was a jury member for the Internationaal Orgel Competition at the Festival of Ancient Music in Bruges. He wrote numerous papers in the field of musicology, was a member of National Academy of Santa Cecilia and published critical editions of the works of Girolamo Frescobaldi, Domenico Zipoli and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.

Systematic position of Dinidoridae within the superfamily Pentatomoidea (Hemiptera: Heteroptera) revealed by the Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of the mitochondrial 12S and 16S rDNA sequences. Zootaxa 3423: 61–68 (2012) ISSN 1175-5334 As a group the family does not have any common name. Until the late 19th century they were generally regarded as a subfamily of the Pentatomidae. Description Most members of the family Dinidoridae are large and robust in build; the bodies of some species may exceed 27 mm in length. In shape they are ovoid to oblong. The head and pronotum have lateral keels. The scutellum is moderately short and blunt, typically some 50% of the abdominal length. The antennae have four or five segments, with at least two of the subapical segments more or less flattened. The antenniferous tubercles are set below the lateral head margins, and are not visible from above. The tarsi have two or three segments. In most genera trichobothria occur in pairs on the third to the seventh abdominal sterna, but Eumenotes species have only one trichobothrium per segment. Each pair of trichobothria is arranged transversely on a large callus mesad of the abdominal spiracles. Taxonomy The taxon corresponding to the modern family Dinidoridae was originally established by Stål in 1870 as the subfamily Dinidorida of the family Pentatomidae. Subsequent authorities such as Lethierry and Severin applied the name Dinidoridae, but in a subfamily sense in spite of the implication of the suffix \\"-dae\\". Twentieth century authorities treated the Dinidoridae as a distinct family, which now is the established view.Rolston, L.H.; Rider, D.A.; Murray, M.J.; Aalbu, R.L. 1996: Catalog of the Dinidoridae of the world. Papua New Guinea journal of agriculture, forestry and fisheries, 39(1): 22–101. PDF Two subfamilies are generally recognised, the Dinidorinae and the Megymeninae. They may be distinguished as follows: Coridius spissus, a typical member of the subfamily Dinidorinae. Megymenum affine, an Australasian member of the subfamily Megymeninae * The subfamily Dinidorinae tend to have a smooth pronotum and to be comparatively smooth in outline; the appearance of the scutellum and the dorsum in general have a homogeneously convex appearance. In the Megymeninae the anterolateral angles of the dorsal surface of the scutellum have marked depressions. * Similarly in the Dinidorinae the posterolateral angles of the abdominal connexiva are smooth and appear nearly entire, whereas in the Megymeninae they are variously tuberculate or lobed. * Furthermore, in most of the Dinidorinae the edge of the metasternum covers the spiracles of the second abdominal segment; in the Megymeninae those spiracles are visible from the exterior. * The legs, and often the antennae, of Megymeninae generally are markedly spiny or setulose. In the Dinidorinae the legs are hardly spiny at all. =Tribes and Genera= BioLibBiolib.cz: family Dinidoridae Stål, 1868 (retrieved 29 August 2020) lists six tribes (and also the unplaced fossil genus †Dinidorites Cockerell, 1921) in the two subfamilies: Dinidorinae The Dinidorinae Stål, 1868 includes the Dinidorini, which comprises tens of species, some with four-segmented and some with five-segmented antennae. ;tribe Amberianini J.A.

All three species have two-segmented tarsi. * Folengus Distant, 1914 * Thalma Walker, 1868 * Urusa Walker, 1868 Megymeninae In the subfamily Megymeninae Amyot & Serville, 1843 the lateral margins of the abdomen and commonly also of the head and pronotum are produced into lobes, tubercles, or spines. In many species the pronotum bears a dorsal anteromedian tuberosity, or a posterior transverse ridge. In most species the legs are heavily and strongly spined; in others the antennae and legs are setulose. ;tribe Byrsodepsini Kocorek & Lis, 2000 * Byrsodepsus Stål, 1872 ;tribe Eumenotini Bergroth, 1907 * Afromenotes Kment & Kocorek, 2014 * Eumenotes Westwood, 1847 ;tribe Megymenini Amyot & Serville, 1843 * Doesbergiana Durai, 1987 - monotypic D. borneoensis Durai, 1987 * Megymenum Guérin-Méneville, 1831 - 23 described species: several species with expanded pronotal margins and some have reduced hemelytra and are flightless. In most species the second valvifers are reduced, lightly sclerotized, and fused mesally. Work continues in establishing the taxonomy of the family in the light of molecular genetics. Current evidence suggests that Dinidoridae is in fact monophyletic and is a sister group to the Tessaratomidae. However the monogeneric tribe Eumenotini, including only the monotypic genus Eumenotes Westwood, had been seen as belonging in the Megymeninae. This however no longer seems defensible. The tribe actually looks closer to the Dinidorinae, but whether it should be assigned to Dinidorinae or to its own subfamily needs separate consideration. Biology All Dinidoridae appear subsist strictly on the sap of host plants in various families, more than twenty in number. Known hosts include members of the following families, on some of which some of the species are recognised as pests:Rider, David A. North Dakota State University. *Amaranthaceae *Arecaceae *Asclepiadaceae *Asteraceae *Balsaminaceae *Convolvulaceae *Cucurbitaceae *Euphorbiaceae *Fabaceae *Malvaceae *Moraceae *Passifloraceae *Pedaliaceae *Poaceae *Rubiaceae *Rutaceae *Sapindaceae *Solanaceae *Theaceae *Urticaceae Distribution Dinidoridae occur mainly in far-eastern and African regions, but the genus Dinidor occurs in neotropical regions and species of Megymenum extend down to Australia.

He then attended the Isenberg School of Management at University of Massachusetts Amherst where he studied accounting and psychology and obtained a PhD in Management in 1990.  Career  Before beginning his career in higher education, Hanno worked as a certified public accountant in New York and Massachusetts, founding and running his own firm in Lowville, New York from 1982 to 1985. In 1990, he became an assistant professor of accounting at the Carroll School of Management at Boston College, where he worked until 1992. From 1992-2006, Hanno worked at the University of Massachusetts Amherst’s Isenberg School of Management where he taught as an associate and assistant professor of accounting and served as associate dean for undergraduate matters. In 2006, he joined the staff at Babson College, as a President’s Endowed Professor of accounting and dean of the undergraduate school. Hanno helped establish and became the first director of the Babson Entrepreneurial Leadership Academy, a program that works with high school students in other countries to help them develop leadership skills and encourage entrepreneurial ideas.

The original study, published in the Journal of the Neurological Sciences in October 2013, involves measuring the ability of people to smell peanut butter held close to their nose. The researchers believe that people with Alzheimer's were not able to smell the peanut butter as well through their left nostril as their right one. However, these results were somewhat inconclusive due to a small sample size and unable to be replicated in a subsequent study. Proposed explanation The lead author of the 2013 article, Jennifer J. Stamps, had concluded, from her own research, that the sense of smell is dependent upon the olfactory nerve, and also noted that this nerve is one of the first things to be affected by cognitive decline. Likewise, the front part of the temporal lobe has not only been implicated in olfaction, but is also known to be one of the first areas of the brain to degenerate due to Alzheimer's. The researchers also expected the difference to be in the left nostril because in Alzheimer's, the left side of the brain is usually affected first, and because the sense of olfaction is ipsilateral—that is, the side of the body that picks up the odor is the same as the side of the brain that processes it. Implications Stamps cautioned that they can currently only use the test to confirm already-established diagnoses, but added that \\"...we plan to study patients with mild cognitive impairment to see if this test might be used to predict which patients are going to get Alzheimer's disease.\\" NPR also reported that the study, at 94 patients, was \\"too small to be conclusive.\\" In 2012, a systematic review had found that while there may be \\"an association between decreased olfaction and AD,\\" \\"rigorously designed longitudinal cohort studies are necessary to clarify the value of olfactory identification testing in predicting the onset of AD.\\" Ivan Oransky, global editorial director of MedPage Today, also criticized the media's favorable coverage of the study, noting that the journal in which it was published, the Journal of the Neurological Sciences, \\"is ranked in the bottom third of neuroscience journals by Thomson Scientific's impact factor, 162 out of 252.\\" He also asked three other Alzheimer's researchers—Richard Caselli, Sam Gandy, and George Bartzokis—what they thought about the proposed test, and their responses were less than enthusiastic. For example, Bartzokis said, \\"The principal problem with smell tests is that they are nonspecific and therefore only one small piece of the diagnostic puzzle.\\" Attempts at replication In 2014, a study was published, also in the Journal of the Neurological Sciences, which found no evidence of a left-right asymmetry in nasal function in Alzheimer's disease patients.

It is an example of Payment for ecosystem services which is helping to solve Environmental issues in China. The program is designed to retire farmland that is susceptible to soil erosion, although some farmers may go back to farming the land after the program ends. China started the Grain for Green program in the western parts of the country for example Shanxi Province. These areas were known for their rather poorly performing economy that was affiliated with an endangered ecological environment. The environment was being further damaged by soil erosion which was a result of cultivation on sloping land as people were changing forests into farmland. Grain for Green has involved 124 million people in 1,897 countries in 25 provinces. The program was set to end 8 years after it initially began, but was extended for another 8 years in 2007. By 2010, around 15 million hectares of farmland and 17 million hectares of barren mountainous wasteland were converted back to natural vegetation. The programme has generally been economically positive for most areas involved, and initial concerns about income inequality and corruption were abated. Specifically, research found that the income status of households was not a determining factor in inclusion in Grain for Green. The programme has also generally addressed the environmental problems it set out to deal with, including soil erosion and flooding. Nevertheless, in many locations it has failed to deliver benefits for biodiversity on the land it has converted \\\\- many tree plantations were mono-cultures which were cheap to plant and easy for the farmers to maintain.

The Dwarves tended to be craftsmen and farmers who maintained friendly trade and peace relations with the Gods of Asgard, even though they were also known for sending minor Asgardians to the Trolls as slaves. Dwarves dwell in the realm of Nidavellir one of the Nine Worlds of Norse mythology. Nidavellir was part of the landmass where Asgard, Alfheim, and Vanaheim were all situated. Dwarves crafted such legendary Asgardian weapons as Thor's hammer Mjolnir and Odin's spear Gungnir. Although it was the magic of Odin that imbued Mjolnir and Gugnir with their special enchantments.

Parametric design is a paradigm in design where the relationship between elements is used to manipulate and inform the design of complex geometries and structures. The term parametric originates from mathematics (parametric equation) and refers to the use of certain parameters or variables that can be edited to manipulate or alter the end result of an equation or system. While today the term is used in reference to computational design systems, there are precedents for these modern systems in the works of architects such as Antoni Gaudí, who used analog models to explore design space. Parametric modeling systems can be divided into two main types: * Propagation-based systems where one computes from known to unknowns with a dataflow model. * Constraint systems which solve sets of continuous and discrete constraints. Form-finding is one of the strategies implemented through propagation-based systems. The idea behind form-finding is to optimize certain design goals against a set of design constraints.  History (early examples)  = Analogue parametric design = An upside down force model of the Sagrada Família, Sagrada Família Museum One of the earliest examples of parametric design was the upside down model of churches by Antonio Gaudi. In his design for the Church of Colònia Güell he created a model of strings weighted down with birdshot to create complex vaulted ceilings and arches. By adjusting the position of the weights or the length of the strings he could alter the shape of each arch and also see how this change influenced the arches connected to it. He placed a mirror on the bottom of the model to see how it should look upside-down.  Features of Gaudi's method  Gaudi's analogue method includes the main features of a computational of a parametric model (input parameters, equation, output): * The string length, birdshot weight and anchor point location all form independent input parameters * The vertex locations of the points on the strings being the outcomes of the model * The outcomes are derived by explicit functions, in this case gravity or Newtons law of motion. By modifying individual parameters of these models Gaudi could generate different versions of his model while being certain the resulting structure would stand in pure compression. Instead of having to manually calculate the results of parametric equations he could automatically derive the shape of the catenary curves through the force of gravity acting on the strings. = Sketchpad = Where Gaudi used physical laws to speed up his calculation of parametric equations, Ivan Sutherland looked to the processing power of digital computers. Sutherland created an interactive computer-aided design program called Sketchpad. Using a light pen, users could draw lines and arcs that could be related to each other using constraints. These constraints contained all the essential properties of parametric equations. Users could experiment and explore different designs by altering the parameters of an entity and let Sketchpad do the calculations and redraw the geometry according to the constraints imposed upon it.  Architecture  Departure Hall of Shenzhen Bao'an International Airport Nature has always served as inspiration for architects and designers. Computer technology has given designers and architects the tools to analyse and simulate the complexity observed in nature and apply it to structural building shapes and urban organizational patterns. In the 1980s architects and designers started using computers running software developed for the aerospace and moving picture industries to \\"animate form\\". One of the first architects and theorists that used computers to generate architecture was Greg Lynn. His blob and fold architecture is some of the early examples of computer generated architecture. Shenzhen Bao'an International Airport's new Terminal 3, finished in 2013, designed by Italian architect Massimiliano Fuksas, with parametric design support by the engineering firm Knippers Helbig, is an example for the use of parametric design and production technologies in a large scale building.  Urban design  Parametric urbanism is concerned with the study and prediction of settlement patterns. Architect Frei Otto distinguishes occupying and connecting as the two fundamental processes that are involved with all urbanisation. Studies look at producing solutions that reduce overall path length in systems while maintaining low average detour factor or facade differentiation.  Software  = [Power Surfacing] = Power Surfacing is a SOLIDWORKS application for industrial design / freeform organic surface / solids modeling. Tightly integrated with SOLIDWORKS, it works with all SOLIDWORKS commands. Reverse Engineer scanned meshes with Power Surfacing RE. = Catia = CATIA (Computer Aided three-dimensional Interactive Application) was used by architect Frank Gehry to design some of his award-winning curvilinear buildings such as the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao. Gehry Technologies, the technology arm of his firm, have since created Digital Project, their own parametric design software based on their experience with CATIA. = Autodesk 3DS Max = Autodesk 3ds Max is a parametric 3D modeling software which provides modeling, animation, simulation, and rendering functions for games, film, and motion graphics. 3ds Max uses the concept of modifiers and wired parameters to control its geometry and gives the user the ability to script its functionality. Max Creation Graph is a visual programming node-based tool creation environment in 3ds Max 2016 that is similar to Grasshopper and Dynamo. = Autodesk Maya = Autodesk Maya is a 3D computer graphics software originally developed by Alias Systems Corporation (formerly AliasWavefront) and currently owned and developed by Autodesk, Inc. It is used to create interactive 3D applications, including video games, animated film, TV series, or visual effects. Maya exposes a node graph architecture. Scene elements are node-based, each node having its own attributes and customization. As a result, the visual representation of a scene is based on a network of interconnecting nodes, depending on each other's information. Maya is equipped with a cross-platform scripting language, called Maya Embedded Language. MEL is provided for scripting and a means to customize the core functionality of the software, since many of the tools and commands used are written in it. MEL or Python can be used to engineer modifications, plug-ins or be injected into runtime. User interaction is recorded in MEL, allowing novice users to implement subroutines. = Grasshopper 3D = The Grasshopper canvas with some nodes Grasshopper 3d (originally Explicit History) is a plug-in for Rhinoceros 3D that presents the users with a visual programming language interface to create and edit geometry. Components or nodes are dragged onto a canvas in order to build a grasshopper definition. Grasshopper is based on graphs (see Graph (discrete mathematics)) that map the flow of relations from parameters through user- defined functions (nodes), resulting in the generation of geometry. Changing parameters or geometry causes the changes to propagate throughout all functions, and the geometry to be redrawn. = Autodesk Revit = Autodesk Revit is building information modeling (BIM) software used by architects and other building professionals. Revit was developed in response to the need for software that could create three-dimensional parametric models that include both geometry and non-geometric design and construction information. Every change made to an element in Revit is automatically propagated through the model to keep all components, views and annotations consistent. This eases collaboration between teams and ensures that all information (floor areas, schedules, etc.) are updated dynamically when changes in the model are made. = Autodesk Dynamo = Dynamo is an open source graphical programming environment for design. Dynamo extends building information modeling with the data and logic environment of a graphical algorithm editor. = GenerativeComponents = GenerativeComponents, parametric CAD software developed by Bentley Systems, was first introduced in 2003, became increasingly used in practice (especially by the London architectural community) by early 2005, and was commercially released in November 2007. GenerativeComponents has a strong traditional base of users in academia and at technologically advanced design firms. GenerativeComponents is often referred to by the nickname of 'GC'. GC epitomizes the quest to bring parametric modeling capabilities of 3D solid modeling into architectural design, seeking to provide greater fluidity and fluency than mechanical 3D solid modeling. Users can interact with the software by either dynamically modeling and directly manipulating geometry, or by applying rules and capturing relationships among model elements, or by defining complex forms and systems through concisely expressed algorithms. The software supports many industry standard file input and outputs including DGN by Bentley Systems, DWG by Autodesk, STL (Stereo Lithography), Rhino, and others. The software can also integrate with Building Information Modeling systems. The software has a published API and uses a simple scripting language, both allowing the integration with many different software tools, and the creation of custom programs by users. This software is primarily used by architects and engineers in the design of buildings, but has also been used to model natural and biological structures and mathematical systems. Generative Components runs exclusively on Microsoft Windows operating systems. = VIKTOR = VIKTOR is an application development platform that enables engineers and other domain experts to rapidly build their own online applications using Python. It is used to create parametric design models and integrates with many software packages. It enables users to make intuitive user interfaces (GUI), which include different form of visualizing results like 3D models, drawings, map or satellite views, and interactive graphs. This makes it possible to make the applications available to persons without programming affinity. Applications made with VIKTOR are online, meaning data is update automatically and everyone works with the same information and the latest models. It includes a user management system, allowing to give different rights to users. = Marionette = Marionette is an open source graphical scripting tool (or visual programming environment) for the architecture, engineering, construction, landscape, and entertainment design industries that is built into the Mac and Windows versions of Vectorworks software. The tool was first made available in the Vectorworks 2016 line of software products. Marionette enables designers to create custom application algorithms that build interactive parametric objects and streamline complex workflows, as well as build automated 2D drawing, 3D modeling, and BIM workflows within Vectorworks software. Built in the Python programming language, everything in Marionette consists of nodes which are linked together in a flowchart arrangement. Each node contains a Python script with predefined inputs and outputs that can be accessed and modified with a built-in editor. Nodes are placed directly into the Vectorworks document and then connected to create complex algorithms. Since Marionette is fully integrated into Vectorworks software, it can also be used to create entirely self-contained parametric objects that can be inserted into new and existing designs. = Modelur = Modelur is a parametric urban design software plug-in for Trimble SketchUp, developed by Agilicity d.o.o. (LLC).. Its primary goal is to help the users create conceptual urban massing. In contrast to common CAD applications, where the user designs buildings with usual dimensions such as width, depth and height, Modelur offers design of built environment through key urban parameters such as number of storeys and gross floor area of a building. Modelur calculates key urban control parameters on the fly (e.g. floor area ratio or required number of parking lots), delivering urban design information while the development is still evolving. This way it helps taking well-informed decision during the earliest stages, when design decisions have the highest impact. = Archimatix = Archimatix is a node-based parametric modeler extension for Unity 3D. It enables visual modeling of 3D models within the Unity 3D editor.

H.R. 4138 would authorize each chamber (through a resolution or joint resolution) to file a civil action in a federal district court to clarify a federal law (that is, seek a declaratory judgment). Under the bill, appeals to a court’s decisions could be reviewed directly by the Supreme Court. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing the legislation would have no significant impact on the federal budget because any amounts expended for court costs or litigation could also be spent under current law on similar activities. Enacting H.R. 4138 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. H.R. 4138 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal governments. Procedural history The Executive Needs to Faithfully Observe and Respect Congressional Enactments of the Law Act of 2014 or the ENFORCE the Law Act of 2014 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on March 4, 2014 by Rep. Trey Gowdy (R, SC-4). The bill was referred to the United States House Committee on the Judiciary and the United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice. On March 7, 2014 it was reported alongside House Report 113-377. On March 7, 2014, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced that H.R. 4138 would be considered on March 12 or 13, 2014. On March 12, 2014, the House voted in Roll Call Vote 124 to pass the bill 233-181. Despite its passage in the House, the bill was not expected to pass in the Senate. On March 12, 2014, President Barack Obama announced that he would veto H.R. 4138 if it was sent to him. Debate and discussion House Republicans argued that the bill was necessary because the Obama Administration refused to enforce the laws. The Republicans pointed to changes and delays he'd made with regards to the ACA, his past decisions not to deport children of illegal immigrants, his uneven enforcement of marijuana laws, and his treatment of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) which Republicans often claimed he had refused to enforce. Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) said that \\"throughout the Obama presidency we have seen a pattern: President Obama circumvents Congress when he doesn't get his way.\\" Majority Leader Eric Cantor said that \\"the president's dangerous search for expanded powers appears to be endless.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress Notes/References External links *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 4138 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 4138 *GovTrack.us H.R. 4138 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 4138 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 4138 *Congressional Budget Office's report on H.R. 4138 *House Republican Conference's legislative digest on H.R. 4138 Category:Proposed legislation of the 113th United States Congress ","title":"ENFORCE the Law Act of 2014"},{"id":"42186340","text":"Thomas Coglan Horsfall (1841–1932) was a noted philanthropist, town planner, writer and founder of the Manchester Art Museum in Ancoats Hall (also known as the Horsfall Museum or Ancoats Museum).Manchester City Galleries – History of the CollectionThomas Coglan Horsfall, and Manchester Art Museum and University Settlements:The Times/1932/Obituary/Thomas Coglan HorsfallManchester City Galleries – Art for All: Thomas Horsfall’s Gift to ManchesterHarrison, M. (1985). Art and philanthropy: TC Horsfall and the Manchester Art Museum. City, Class and Culture, 120-47. Life Horsfall was the son of William Horsfall, owner of textile businesses in Halifax and Manchester, England. He was educated in Manchester and Bowdon.The Times, Obituary Though a partner in his father's businesses, he did not take a very active role due to ill health, and devoted himself to philanthropic work.thomas coglan horsfall and manchester art museum and university settlement Horsfall's views were linked to his strongly held Christian faith. He was a supporter of the Church Reform Union, part of the wider movement of Muscular Christianity, which stressed active social engagement. Horsfall was also profoundly influenced by the ideas of John Ruskin, with whom he corresponded extensively. =Museum= Horsfall was a strong believer in the idea that art had an educational and moral role to play in society. In 1877 he began the movement to establish free galleries for the poor in a letter to the Manchester Guardian. Ruskin's educational art gallery in Sheffield was his model. He wrote, \\"I may be asked why are we to do this work which it might seem is chiefly work that should be done for the city by itself – by its governing body. The answer is – we must do it, because we are willing to do it and can do it.\\"Wilson, Shelagh, \\"The Highest Art for the lowest People: The Whitechapel and Other Philanthropic Art Galleries, 1877–1901\\", Governing Cultures, Ashgate, 2000, pp.172–86. Horsfall even argued that local employers should donate money to the gallery rather than pay higher wages to their employees because \\"For we [the middle-class] alone have learnt that money may have other powers than that of buying beer and bread. Higher wages can only lead to greater debasement.\\" In a lecture to the National Association for the Promotion of Social Science, he stated: The gallery moved to Ancoats Hall in 1886. In keeping with his moral views, no nudes were displayed at the gallery. A room in the gallery was furnished by William Morris as an example of aesthetic design. According to historian Shelagh Wilson, the gallery was popular as a respectable alternative attraction to pubs and music halls, but by the early 20th century it was unable to compete with new forms of popular entertainment. When a cinema opened nearby, attendance dropped dramatically. =Other activities= Horsfall was also a strong supporter of the Settlement movement, which sought to place the educated middle classes in socially deprived areas. He gave financial support to Toynbee Hall and was linked to the work of Samuel Barnett in Whitechapel, London. The Manchester University Settlement grew out of this, based at Ancoats under Horsfall's leadership. Along with T. R. Marr, Horsfall set up the Citizens' Association for the Improvement of the Unwholesome Dwellings and Surroundings of the People, to eliminate slum housing. In 1900, Horsfall joined with Henry Birchenough to instigate the Patriotic Association of Macclesfield, which was envisaged as a feeder for the local Volunteer Force.Sarah Jane Griffiths PHD Thesis Liverpool University 2006 Charitable work of the Macclesfield silk manufacturers, 1750–1900 Subsequently, he became treasurer of the Association. In addition, Horsfall took an interest in improving the air quality of Manchester which, as the first industrial city, left much to be desired. His extensive travels in Europe reinforced this desire for change as he was able to contrast his dingy, smoke-laden home, where even vegetation in the new municipal parks struggled to survive, with the much cleaner and appealing cities that he visited. He was a member of the Manchester and Salford Noxious Vapours Abatement Association, later called the Smoke Abatement League. =Personal life= In 1878 Horsfall married Frances Emma Reeves. The couple had three daughters. He died in 1932 at the age of 90. Selected publications *The Study of Beauty, and Art in Large Towns (Two papers by T.C.

Instrumental magnitude is defined in various ways, and so when working with instrumental magnitudes, it is important to know how they are defined. The most basic definition of instrumental magnitude, m, is given by :m = -2.5 \\\\log_{10}(f) where f is the intensity of the source object in known physical units. For example, in the paper by Mighell, it was assumed that the data are in units of electron number (generated within pixels of a charge-coupled device). The physical units of the source intensity are thus part of the definition required for any instrumental magnitudes that are employed. The factor of 2.5 in the above formula originates from the established fact that the human eye can only clearly distinguish the brightness of two objects if one is at least approximately 2.5 times brighter than the other. The instrumental magnitude is defined such that two objects with a brightness ratio of exactly 100 will differ by precisely 5 magnitudes, and this is based on Pogson's system of defining each successive magnitude as being fainter by 100^{1/5}. We can now relate this to the base-10 logarithmic function and the leading coefficient in the above formula: :100^{1/5}=(10^2)^{1/5}=10^{2/5}=10^{0.4} = 2.51188643 \\\\cdots The approximate value of 2.5 is used as a convenience, its negative sign assures that brighter objects will have smaller and possibly negative values, and tabulated values of base-10 logarithms were available more than three centuries before the advent of computers and calculators.

This very elusive and shy animal had earlier been captured on camera in the northern and western parts of Sikkim. However, this is the first photographic capture of a snow leopard in East Sikkim. This image capture of both, the Bengal Tiger and the Snow Leopard, in exactly the same location confirms the overlap in the migratory routes used by the two big cats inside Pangolakha, having migrated from the neighbouring Neora Valley National Park of West Bengal, it's been further reported by the Divisional Forest Officer.

J. Barrington, Discovering Kerry, its history, heritage and topography (Dublin Blackwater Press, 1976) Biography Mullins was the son of William Mullins and Mary Rowan.Michael C. O'Laughlin, Families of Co. Kerry, Ireland (Irish Roots Cafe, 1994), 109. His great- grandfather had settled in County Kerry in 1666, purchasing land at Burnham, near Dingle, and had served as a Member of the Irish House of Commons. Mullins was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, graduating in 1754. He served as High Sheriff of Kerry in 1759, and in 1760 was made a member of the Privy Council of Ireland. In 1790 he built a new stately home for his family overlooking Dingle harbour, called Burnham Manor. On 18 June 1793, over 4,000 people marched in Dingle to protest against high rents and the establishment of a local militia. Mullins, who assumed responsibility for the town on behalf of the Crown, brought in 70 soldiers from Limerick to break up the demonstration. The riot was quelled when soldiers were ordered to shoot at the crowd, and 14 farmers were killed with many others being injured.Jim Smyth, The men of no property, Irish Radicals and Popular Politics in the Late Eighteenth Century (Palgrave Macmillan, 1998) In 1795, Mullins bought Castle Conway from his relation, Harman Blennerhassett. On 7 December 1797, he was created a baronet, of Burnham in the County of Kerry, in the Baronetage of Ireland. He was further honoured when, on 31 July 1800, he was created Baron Ventry of Burnham, in the Peerage of Ireland.John Burke, A General and Heraldic Dictionary of the Peerage and Baronetage of the British Empire (H. Colburn and R. Bentley, 1833), 568. This was largely due to the help he and his son, William, had given to Lord Castlereagh in securing the passage of the Irish Act of Union of 1800. Mullins died in 1824, and was succeeded by his eldest son, William Townsend Mullins, 2nd Baron Ventry. On 7 October 1755, Mullins had married Elizabeth Gunn.

The catalog consists of the location of 1,564 stars listed by constellation. It consists of three separate parts: a preface (labeled Prodromus), a star catalog (named Catalogus Stellarum), and an atlas of constellations (named Firmamentum Sobiescianum, sive Uranographia). Prodromus Prodromus outlines the methodology and technology used in creating the star catalogue. It provides examples of the use of the sextant and quadrant by Hevelius, in tandem with known positions of the sun, in calculating each stars' longitude and latitude. Catalogus Stellarum The written draft of the Catalogus Stellarum consists of 183 leaves, 145, alphabetized according to constellation, containing star positions. Each star had specific information recorded in columns: the reference number and magnitude found by astronomer Tycho Brahe, Hevelius' own magnitude calculation, the star's longitude and latitude by both ecliptic coordinates measured by angular distances and meridian altitudes found using Hevelius' quadrant, and the star's equatorial coordinates calculated using spherical trigonometry. The printed version was similar to the written draft, except the two columns describing a star's ecliptic coordinates were combined, and only the single best value for the star's latitude and longitude was given. Also, the printed version held more than 600 new stars and 12 new constellations not documented in the written draft, bringing its total to 1564. Although the observations of the catalog used nothing more than the astronomer's naked eye, the measurements were so precise as to be used in the making of celestial globes into the early 18th Century.Nick Kanas: Star Maps: History, Artistry, and Cartography, 2nd ed., June 13, 2012. Springer Praxis Books / Popular Astronomy. Firmamentum Sobiescianum Firmamentum Sobiescianum, while technically part of the Prodromus Astronomiae, was likely published separately and in tighter circulation. Housing its own cover page and page-numbering system, the atlas consisted of two hemispheres and 54 double-page plates of 73 constellations. Both the northern and southern hemispheres were centered on an ecliptic pole, and most star locations were all based on Hevelius' own observations. Those that were not, the southern polar stars, were based on a catalog and map published in 1679 by Edmond Halley.

Lawson, 25 April 1945 in Alton, Hampshire, England) is an English keyboardist and contemporary composer who in the 1970s was a member of UK progressive rock band Greenslade. Biography =Early years and Greenslade= During the 1970s Lawson was a member of Greenslade, an English progressive rock band which formed in the autumn of 1972. They made their live debut at Frankfurt's Zoom Club in November 1972, with a line-up of Dave Greenslade (keyboards), Tony Reeves (bass guitar and double bass), Andrew McCulloch (drums and percussion) and Lawson (keyboards and vocals). The band recorded four studio albums: * 1973: Greenslade * 1973: Bedside Manners Are Extra * 1974: Spyglass Guest – UK No. 34 * 1975: Time and Tide In the band Lawson largely shared composition with Dave Greenslade, generally writing the lyrics for Greenslade's music, but also contributing music of his own. In contrast to Dave Greenslade's preference for Hammond organ, mellotron and piano, Lawson proved to be a pioneer of analogue synthesizers.Romano, W. 2010, Mountains Come Out of the Sky: The Illustrated History of Prog Rock, Backbeat Books, The band announced their disbandment in early 1976, due to management problems, and Lawson then worked as a session musician before touring with Roy Harper and later Stackridge, for which band he appeared on the 1976 album Mr. Mick. In the late 1970's he played mellotron on a BBC live broadcast of David Bedford's Instructions for Angels. He was invited to join the band of Ian Gillan who had recently left Deep Purple but had to decline. He also recorded with Chris Squire and Alan White, who were taking a break from the band Yes, alongside Jimmy Page in a project titled XYZ. Lawson also played with Curved Air and in 1982, whilst recording with Bill Wyman, was invited to play with Foreigner. =Later years= Lawson played on the soundtrack of the film The Man Who Fell to Earth (1976) and later played with John Williams and the LSO for the films Star Wars (1977), Superman (1978) and The Fury (1978). In Star Wars Lawson can be heard playing the ARP 2600 to conjure the sounds of an electric tuba in the famous Tatooine cantina scene. He was a session musician for Peggy Lee, Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire. Lawson has worked as music associate, performer and programmer with such Hollywood film composers such as George Fenton, John Williams and Trevor Jones. He has also composed for a number of successful feature films and television programs. He has become particularly noted for his work on so-called \\"fusion scores\\" such as those for the feature films Angel Heart and Mississippi Burning. He also worked on Steven Spielberg's We're Back! and on Kenneth Branagh's Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, each of which won Golden Reel Awards from the Association of Motion Picture Sound Editors. In 1988–89, he composed the theme music for the BBC series The Paradise Club, the music for which was later issued as a soundtrack album, with contributions by Stan Tracey Big Band, Carmel and Snake Davis, amongst others. Lawson has also composed and co-composed, with Ronnie Bond and David Dundas, music for many cinema and television advertisements including those for British Gas, Coco Pops, Philips, Le Coq, Bird's Custard, Braun, Blueband, Britannia, Philip Morris, Accurist, Atari, Dixel, Dulux, Roxy, Mintguard, Bonjour, Ellermans, Wilkinson Sword, Foster Grant, Alpine, Wash'n Dye, Arctic Lite, Yves Saint Laurent.

The total funding for research would come to $126 million over 10 years. At the time of its passage, national conventions drew about 23% of their funding from the Presidential Election Campaign Fund. It became law during the 113th United States Congress. Background Gabriella Miller was a girl who died of cancer on October 26, 2013 at the age of 10. While she was ill, she worked as an activist to raise support for research into childhood illnesses like cancer. Through her activism, she \\"raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for the Make-A-Wish Foundation and helped launch the Smashing Walnuts Foundation to fund pediatric cancer research.\\" In \\"The Truth 365\\" documentary, Miller answered a question that what she'd like to tell American leaders about research on pediatric cancer was that there needed to be \\"less talking, more doing... We need action.\\" House Majority Leader Eric Cantor saw this video and decided to name the bill in her honor. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act would amend the Internal Revenue Code to terminate the entitlement of any major or minor political party to a payment from the Presidential Election Campaign Fund for a presidential nominating convention. The bill transfers funds in each account maintained for the national committee of a party to a 10-Year Pediatric Research Initiative Fund, making them available only for allocation to national research institutes and national centers through the Common Fund for making grants for pediatric research under this Act. The bill would amend the Public Health Service Act to require the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), through the Division of Program Coordination, Planning, and Strategic Initiatives, to allocate funds appropriated under this Act to the national research institutes and national centers for making grants for pediatric research representing important areas of emerging scientific opportunities, rising public health challenges, or knowledge gaps that deserve special emphasis and would benefit from conducting or supporting additional research that involves collaboration between two or more national research institutes or national centers, or would otherwise benefit from strategic coordination and planning. The bill would authorize $12.6 million out of the 10-Year Pediatric Research Initiative Fund for each of FY2014-FY2023 for pediatric research through the Common Fund. Requires such funds to supplement, not supplant, funds otherwise allocated by NIH for pediatric research. Prohibits the use of such amounts for any purpose other than allocating funds for making grants for pediatric research described in this Act. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, a public domain source. H.R. 2019 would amend federal law to end the taxpayers' option to designate a portion of their federal income tax balance to the Presidential Election Campaign Fund and end the authority to spend funds on Presidential campaigns or conventions. The bill also would authorize the appropriation of $13 million a year over the 2014-2023 period for pediatric research. Procedural history The Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on May 16, 2013 by Rep. Gregg Harper (R, MS-3). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce, the United States House Committee on House Administration, the United States House Committee on Ways and Means, and the United States House Energy Subcommittee on Health. On December 11, 2013, the House voted in Roll Call Vote 632 to pass the bill 295-103. On March 11, 2014, the United States Senate passed the bill by unanimous consent. President Barack Obama signed the bill into law on April 3, 2014, as . Debate and discussion According to Rep. Eric Cantor, the bill \\"clearly reflects Congressional priorities in funding: medical research before political parties and conventions.\\" 102 House Democrats voted against the bill. The opposition, as stated in a Dear Colleague Letter, noted that the legislation had \\"completely bypassed the committee process,\\" and therefore lacked the benefit of \\"discussion and debate as to what would be the most effective way of increasing financial support for pediatric biomedical research.\\" Additional problems included the fact that the legislation \\"does not actually provide any additional funds to NIH. Rather, it specifies that the funds shall be available for NIH pediatric research \\"only to the extent and in such amounts as are provided in advance in appropriation Acts.\\" The opposition also suggested that \\"perhaps this purely symbolic legislation is an effort to distract attention from the House Majority's actual record of support for biomedical research --a record which has been dismal in recent years.\\"\\"Oppose the so-called \\"Kids First Research Act\\" (December 11, 2013) http://democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Dear- Colleague-Opposed-So-Called-Kids-First-Research-Act-2013-12-11.pdf Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. (D-NJ) said that the bill was \\"a disingenuous and empty attempt by the Republicans to divert attention from the fact that they have voted to cut research time and time again.\\" Senator Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) noted that \\"it's hard to imagine that there would be any objection to moving these funds to something we can all agree is a high priority - pediatric research.\\" The bill was opposed by some campaign finance reform groups who were skeptical that the money would actually be appropriated to the NIH.

He showed promise in his early career, winning the Dovecote Novices' Hurdle at Kempton Park Racecourse in 2011 and emerged as a top class performer with a win in the Celebration Chase in April 2013. In the 2013–14 National Hunt season he established himself as the leading two-mile steeplechaser in Britain, winning the Tingle Creek Chase, Desert Orchid Chase, Clarence House Chase and the Queen Mother Champion Chase. He continued to run in top-class two-mile steeplechases without fully recapturing his 2013–14 form, winning one race in each of the following three seasons including a second win in the Tingle Creek Chase, before being retired in December 2017. Background Sire de Grugy is a chestnut horse with a broad white blaze bred by La Grugerie stud at Pouancé, Maine-et-Loire in France. He was sired by the Thoroughbred stallion My Risk who won seven races including the Prix Quincey, Prix Perth, Prix Edmond Blanc and Prix du Chemin de Fer du Nord. Apart from Sire de Grugy, the best of his progeny has been the flat racer No Risk At All who won La Coupe and the Grand Prix de Vichy-Auvergne. Sire de Grugy's dam Hirlish, was not a Thoroughbred, being descended from La Camargo, a mare of unknown parentage, whose descendants have been classified as AQPS or Selle Français. As a fiftieth- birthday present, the friends and family of the businessman Steve Preston contributed to a fund which was to be used to buy a racehorse. Preston approached the trainer Gary Moore who agreed to pay 25% of the purchase price providing that he was allowed full control of the horses career. The trainer's son Jamie Moore, located Sire de Grugy as a likely prospect but the asking price of €50,000 required further financial help from Preston's associates and the horse became the property of the Preston Family & Friends Syndicate. The gelding was sent into training with Moore at Lower Beeding in West Sussex. He was ridden in all but two of his races by Jamie Moore. Racing career =2010/2011 National Hunt season: National Hunt Flat races and Novice hurdles= Sire de Grugy began his racing career by finishing second in a National Hunt Flat race at Sandown Park Racecourse on 6 November 2010. He made his debut over obstacles in a novice hurdle two weeks later at Kempton Park in which he finished second to the future Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Bobs Worth. The gelding returned to National Hunt Flat racing at Kempton in December and finished fourth behind Chain Of Command. At Fakenham Racecourse on 1 January he recorded his first success as he won a maiden hurdle by nineteen lengths at odds of 4/9. In February he won a novice hurdle at Folkestone Racecourse by sixteen lengths and then moved up in class to take the Grade II Dovecote Novices' Hurdle at Kempton beating Empire Levant by eleven lengths. On his final appearance of the season he started the 9/2 favourite for the Top Novices' Hurdle at Aintree Racecourse in April but finished third behind Topolski and Oilily. =2011/2012 National Hunt season= In the following season Sire de Grugy was campaigned in handicap hurdle races. He made his seasonal reappearance in January when he finished sixth at Chepstow Racecourse and then finished fourth behind Zarkandar in the Tote Gold Trophy. He recorded his only success of the season on 21 February when he carried top weight of 160 pounds to victory at Taunton Racecourse. He finished third in the Imperial Cup at Sandown in March and ended his season by finishing eighth (ridden by Joshua Moore) behind Lifestyle at Aintree in April. =2012/2013 National Hunt season: Novice chases= In the 2012/2013 National Hunt season, Sire de Grugy raced in novice steeplechase, making a successful debut over larger obstacles at Kempton on 21 October. He finished second to Captain Conan in the Grade II November Novices' Chase at Cheltenham Racecourse on 18 November before winning a minor event at Lingfield Park nine days later. Where he suffered a hairline fracture to his pelvis. After a four-month break, Sire de Grugy returned in spring and ran three times in three weeks. He finished fourth to Special Tiara in the Grade I Maghull Novices' Chase at Aintree on 6 April before winning a minor novices' event at Stratford Racecourse fifteen days later. On 27 April he started at odds of 6/1 for the Celebration Chase at Sandown in which he was matched against more experienced chasers including Sanctuaire, who had won the race in 2012 and Finian's Rainbow, the winner of the 2012 Champion Chase. Moore tracked the leaders before moving up to challenge Finian's Rainbow at the last fence. He took the lead on the run in and was driven out to win his first major steeplechase by one and three-quarter lengths. =2013/2014 National Hunt season= Sire de Grugy began his fourth season in a handicap chase at Chepstow on 26 October, in which he carried top weight of 166 pounds. Starting at odds of 7/2, he took the lead after the third last and accelerated clear of his rivals to win in \\"impressive\\" style by eleven lengths despite a mistake at the last. On 17 November, the gelding started as odds-on favourite for the Shloer Chase at Cheltenham. He recovered from several jumping errors to take the lead at the second last but was overtaken fifty yards from the finish and beaten by the Nicky Henderson-trained Kid Cassidy, who was carrying ten pounds less. Three weeks later, Sire de Grugy started joint-favourite with Captain Conan for the Grade I Tingle Creek Trophy at Sandown. Moore restrained the gelding in the early stages before moving forward to challenge for the lead approaching the final fence. Sire de Grugy went clear on the run-in to win by four lengths from the Mick Channon-trained nine-year-old Somersby with Captain Conan in third place. On 27 December, Sire de Grugy was matched against the outstanding two-mile chaser Sprinter Sacre, winner of his last ten races, in the Grade II Desert Orchid Chase at Kempton. Sprinter Sacre was pulled up after the seventh fence (subsequent veterinary examinations revealed a heart problem), leaving Sire de Grugy to take the lead four fences from the finish and win by four lengths from Oiseau de Nuit, with a gap of twenty-six lengths back to Astracad in third. On 18 January, Sire de Grugy started 5/4 favourite for the Grade I Clarence House Chase at Ascot Racecourse. As in some of his earlier races, he jumped to the left at several fences but took the lead approaching the second last and went clear of his rivals to win by eleven lengths from the Irish-trained Hidden Cyclone. Sire de Grugy made his first appearance at the Cheltenham Festival when he was one of eleven horses to contest the Queen Mother Champion Chase. He started the 11/4 favourite in a field which included Captain Conan, Somersby, Special Tiara and the 2011 winner Sizing Europe. His odds had lengthened after doubt about his ability to cope with the peculiarities of the course and the drying ground. Moore rode the horse with great confidence, holding him up at the back of the field before moving up to track the leaders three fences from the finish. He took the lead approaching the last and went clear to win by six lengths from Somersby. After the race, Jamie Moore said \\"I've got a good rapport with this horse, I love him to pieces. It's all down to him. It's a great effort by Dad as well. He's had no credit this season, as far as I'm concerned, but it's all down to the horse. I love him so much. It's tremendous for all the family. It proves we can do it\\". Gary Moore commented \\"it's something I hoped would happen but it doesn't happen very often. The plan worked out very well. The horse is professional and easy to train to a certain extent. He trod on a stone 10 days ago and it was a little worry but it couldn't have gone any better today\\". Sire de Grugy, who had already been named British jump racing's Horse of the Year, ended his season by repeating his 2013 success in the Celebration Chase at Sandown. Starting the 2/7 favourite against five opponents, he took the lead at the second last fence and won by three and a quarter lengths from the mare Pepite Rose. Jamie Moore said that the horse was unsuited by the \\"tacky\\" ground whilst his trainer said \\"He was the most on edge he's been all season when I was saddling him and he was probably coming to end of his tether. But that shows what a great horse he is.\\" =2014/2015 National Hunt season= Sire de Grugy was expected to return at Cheltenham in November, but was found to be lame shortly before his scheduled comeback: subsequent veterinary tests revealed a hip injury. The gelding eventually reappeared after an absence of more than nine months in the Game Spirit Chase at Newbury on 7 February 2015. He started 10/11 favourite but unseated Jamie Moore at the third last in a race won easily by the Paul Nicholls-trained Mr Mole. Two weeks later, the gelding contested the Bombay Hunt Cup at Chepstow in which he carried twenty pounds more than his three opponents. Starting the 5/4 favourite, he took the lead two fences from the finish and drew away in the closing stages to win by seven lengths from Grey Gold. On 11 March, Sire de Grugy attempted to repeat his 2014 success in the Queen Mother Champion Stakes in which he was opposed by two previous winners of the race in Sprinter Sacre and Sizing Europe. After being restrained in the early stages he began to make progress four fences from the finish but was never able to reach the leaders and finished fourth behind Dodging Bullets, Somersby and Special Tiara. He was moved up in distance for the Melling Chase at Aintree but fell at the sixth fence. =2015/2016 National Hunt season= Sire de Grugy made a disappointing seasonal debut in the Grade 2 Haldon Gold Cup where after a bad error at the fourth fence he failed to keep up with the leaders and was eased in the home straight to finish last of the five runners, but returned to winning ways in his next start on 5 December regaining the Grade 1 Tingle Creek Chase by three parts of a length from Special Tiara with which he had a mid-air interference at the last fence forcing the race to go through a stewards inquiry but the winning result stood with his jockey Jamie Moore reporting: \\"He always jumps left, he's jumped a bit left again at the last\\". Just three weeks later he had another outing, on 27 December, in the Grade 2 Desert Orchid Chase which he had previously won in 2013. He encountered four rivals and started second favourite. After closely tracking the leader Somersby, he took control at the 7th fence but made a costly mistake at the final obstacle at which he surrendered the lead and just failed by three-parts of a length at the line, finishing second to Sprinter Sacre. A month later he again started second favourite in the betting, this time in the Grade 1 Clarence House Chase which he won in 2014. He was racing against the up-and- coming Un de Sceaux who was sent as a very short odds favourite at thanks to his unbeaten record at the time in all of his completed starts. Sire de Grugy chased him for the entire race but after looking like a threat at the second- last fence he failed to make any impressions and finished tired, five lengths away in second spot with his stablemate Traffic Fluide just a short head in third.

Bunzel was one of the first anthropologists to study the creative process, and she was the first American anthropologist to conduct substantial research in Guatemala.

New York and London: Garland, S, 86.  Early life  Ruth Lead Bunzel was born in New York City on April 18, 1898 to Jonas and Hattie Bernheim. Bunzel lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan with her parents and lived most of her life in Greenwich Village, only leaving New York for long periods of time when conducting fieldwork. Bunzel's father passed away when she was ten, and she was raised by her mother. Bunzel was the youngest of four children.  Education  Bunzel's mother encouraged her to study German at Barnard College because of her German and Czech heritage, but World War I inspired Bunzel to change her major to European history. Bunzel received a Bachelor of Art in European History in 1918 from Barnard College. She started her career as the secretary and editorial assistant to Franz Boas in 1922, founder of anthropology at Columbia University, after having taken one of his courses in college. Boas encouraged her to take up anthropology directly. Bunzel replaced Esther Goldfrank, a friend of one of her sisters, who resigned the position to study anthropology at Columbia. By 1924, Bunzel was considering a career in anthropology, but first wanted to observe anthropological fieldwork. Bunzel planned to spend the summer of 1924 in western New Mexico and east-central Arizona, particularly in Zuni Pueblo, New Mexico. She planned to serve as secretary to Columbia University anthropologist Ruth Benedict, aiding in transcription and typing while Benedict was collecting Zuni mythology. Bunzel encouraged Bunzel to pursue her own research while in Zuni Pueblo that summer and suggested that Bunzel study art and Zuni potters, instead of working on secretarial work. Anthropologist Elsie Clews Parsons objected to the idea of Bunzel conducted research among the Zuni people since Bunzel lacked formal anthropological training, and Parsons threatened to remove her financial support of Benedict's research. Boas stepped in, and Parsons allowed the research visit as a personal favor to Boas.  Fieldwork among the Pueblo of Zuni  In the early twentieth century, anthropologist used a method of study called participant observation, which Bunzel utilized when conducting fieldwork among the Zuni people. In the summer of 1924, Bunzel conducted fieldwork among the Zuni people; she apprenticed herself to Zuni potters and observed as well as made potteryalongside them. Focusing her research on pottery offered Bunzel an opportunity to learn from Zuni women's work since women did not participate in Zuni ritual practices. Bunzel was fascinated by the prominent role of women as potters in Zuni society. Bunzel also studied the Hopi, San Ildefonso, Acoma, and San Felipe Pueblo Indians of the southwestern United States as well. Bunzel utilized this fieldwork for her dissertation, The Pueblo Potter: A Study of Creative Imagination in Primitive Art, which was published in 1929. Her 1929 dissertation describes the creative process of Zuni potters, who preserve and reproduce traditional patterns even as individual potters innovate and create new ones. Bunzel later said, \\"Look, I was never studying pottery. I was studying human behavior. I wanted to know how the potters felt about what they were doing.\\"Bunzel, R. (1976). \\"Chamula and Chichicastenango: A Re-examination\\", in Cross-Cultural Approaches to the Study of Alcohol, The Hague: Mouton & Co., pp. 21-22 In 1925, after returning to New York, Bunzel resigned as Boaz's secretary, and just like Goldfrank, enrolled as a student at Columbia University to study anthropology. Bunzel was part of the second cohort trained by Boas at Columbia University. She completed her doctoral dissertation in 1927, but she was not fully awarded her PhD until 1929 when her book, The Pueblo Potter, was published. Bunzel’s book was the first anthropological study of individual creativity in art within overarching artistic boundaries. Parsons, who had initially objected to Bunzel travelling to study the Zuni, sponsored her second trip to study ceremonialism among the Zuni people as well as future trips and projects. The products of this research on Zuni ceremonialism, creation myths, kachinas, and poetry were published in 1932. Bunzel focused on the aesthetic freedom of the individual. Her research produced many publications on Pueblo art, ritual, and folklore, including “Notes on the Kachina Cult in San Felipe” (1928), “The Emergence” (1928), Zuni Texts (1933), and “Zuni” (1935). Bunzel published her research widely and contributed to publications by other prominent anthropologists. She also produced literature related to Zuni language and culture, providing material for Benedict’s Zuni information in Patterns of Culture. Bunzel became known as an authority on the Zuni people and learned the Zuni language [4] and actively incorporated her informant’s views into her writing on the Katcina Cult, something that she also did in her later monograph Chichicastenango: A Guatemalan Village. Bunzel edited The Golden Age of American Anthropology (1960) with Margaret Mead and contributed to Boas and Benedict’s General Anthropology (1938). During her fieldwork among the Zuni people, Bunzel lived with Flora Zuni and her family, who initiated her into the Beaver clan and gave her the Zuni name Maiatitsa or “blue bird”. Bunzel was also given another Zuni name, Tsatitsa, by the former governor of the pueblo and one of her key informants, Nick Tumaka. Bunzel returned to the Zuni people in 1939 to study Zuni child development. This was her last trip to Zuni Pueblo, New Mexico. Margaret Mead also acknowledged Ruth Bunzel’s contribution in her book Cooperation and Competition Among Primitive Peoples in the prelude, noting how Dr. Ruth Bunzel allowed Mead to use of her manuscript related to Zuni economics and offered criticisms and suggestions throughout the writing.  Fieldwork in Guatemala and Mexico  Bunzel interviewed for a Guggenheim Fellowship to study Mexican culture but was redirected to study Guatemala, as little American anthropological research existed in this area at the time. Bunzel studied the Santa Tomas Chichicastenango, a Highland Mayan Village, from 1930 to 1932, resulting in the completion in 1936 and publication in 1952 of her monograph Chichicastenango: A Guatemalan Village. True to her prior plans, Bunzel also conducted fieldwork in Chamula in Chiapas, Mexico from 1936 to 1937 as part of a comparative study on “The Role of Alcoholism in Two Central American Communities,” in Chichicastenango and Chamula. Influenced by psychoanalyst Karen Horney, Bunzel focused on the psychological factors contributing to different drinking patterns in Chamula and Chichicastenango. This was the first anthropological study on alcoholism and drinking patterns among different cultures. Bunzel stated that she was not studying alcohol; rather, she studied \\"people and their drinking habits as seen in their cultural contexts and the influences behind these habits.\\" Bunzel advanced her field by challenging its methodology. She argued that her primary consultant’s insights were incomplete and could not therefore provide generalized information about the culture, rather viewing his or her contributions as partial and individual to that person or smaller groups of people. Bunzel viewed knowledge production as culturally situated, limiting her ethnographic interpretations to a specific group of Maya-K'iche’ people in the Guatemalan highlands. Bunzel also advanced the field by studying Chichicastenango, an urban center and hub in the Central American trade system, as opposed to rural settings in Guatemala. Bunzel did not follow anthropological conventions of the time to study “pure,” isolated cultures but instead chose to study centers of change, contact, and trade. Bunzel also juxtaposed her own interpretations of Guatemalan ritual events with those offered by her informants in her monograph Chichicastenango. Her monograph Chichicastenango was greatly influenced by Boas' historical particularism and Benedict’s culture and personality research focused on child development. Like at the Zuni Pueblo, when Bunzel relied greatly on one female informant Flora Zuni and her family, she did the same in Chichicastenango, and attached herself to one informant to obtain a focused perspective on a small group of people rather than generalizing her results to an entire culture.  Professional career  During her early career, Bunzel worked as a lecturer at Barnard College from 1929 to 1930 and at Columbia University between 1933-1935 and 1937-1940. Like many other female anthropologists at Columbia University, including Isabel Kelly, Ruth Landes, and Eleanor Leacock, Bunzel never held a full-time university appointment or tenure. During her professional career, Bunzel faced social gender politics that prevented her from obtaining a tenure position and threatened her fieldwork. Some of her male colleagues spread inflammatory rumors about unprofessional activity in Chichicastenango that negatively affected Bunzel’s professional support among colleagues and prevented her from obtaining a full-time university position. During World War II, Bunzel worked in England translating broadcasts from English to Spanish and translating incoming Spanish broadcasts for the U.S. Government Office of War Information from 1942 to 1945. Bunzel also contributed to propaganda analysis efforts. After World War II, she became involved in the RCC, the Columbia University Research in Contemporary Cultures Project. This project was funded by the office of Naval Research to study different cultures and Bunzel lead a research group studying China which interviewed Chinese immigrants in New York City between 1947 and 1951. In 1951 and 1952, Bunzel developed interview techniques at the Bureau of Applied Social Research project until her appointment as an Adjunct Professor of Anthropology at Columbia University in 1953.  Later life  From 1969 to 1987, Bunzel served as a Senior Research Associate at Columbia University. According to her official appointment card, Bunzel retired in 1966 from her position at Columbia University but even after her official retirement, continued to teach until 1972. From 1972 to 1974, Bunzel worked as a visiting professor at Bennington College. Bunzel suffered cardiac arrest on January 14, 1990 and died at the age of 91 in St. Vincent's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. The Ruth Leah Bunzel Papers are currently housed at the National Anthropological Archives, including correspondence, manuscripts, notes, research files, teaching materials, artwork, sound recordings, and more.

Known as the \\"Founding Mother of the Rape Crisis Center movement in Michigan,\\" she was named to the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame in 1991. Early life BenDor was born in 1946. She received a Master of Social Work from the University of Michigan and is currently ABD in the University of Michigan's psychology doctoral program. Women's Crisis Center BenDor was active at the Women's Crisis Center of Ann Arbor. The Center was a non-profit phone counseling service run for and by women of the community. In addition to telephone support for any problems women had, the Center had information about community resource, events, and support groups. BenDor contributed to two known publications related to the Crisis Center. Freedom from Rape is an underground newspaper with information about area rape statistics, rape myths, and how community and law enforcement impact rape culture. How to Organize a Women's Crisis-Service Center is both a description of the genesis of the Women's Crisis Center of Ann Arbor and a guide for developing a center.  Michigan Women's Task Force on Rape In the early 1970s, BenDor worked as part of the anti-rape movement to change Michigan State law related to sexual assault. The Michigan Women's Task Force on Rape, established in 1973, had as its main goals to \\"de-sexualize\\" the crime of rape and to move burden of proof from the victim to the accused. Michigan's Criminal Sexual Conduct Statute (Public Act No. 266) was approved on August 12, 1974, and went into effect on April 1, 1975. Domino's Pizza boycott In 1989, the National Organization for Women declared a boycott of Domino's Pizza owner Tom Monaghan's support of anti-abortion legislation in the state of Michigan and his cancellation of events to be held at Domino's Farms in Ann Arbor. The group also cited Monaghan's right wing activities in Central America, discriminatory hiring practices, and anti-union stance as reasons for the boycott. The Coalition to Boycott Domino's Pizza, or as it later became known, included members of NOW, Ann Arbor Coalition to Defend Abortion Right, Industrial Workers of the World, Latin American Solidarity Committee, among others. BenDor, as president of the Ann Arbor chapter of NOW, led the boycott. The Detroit chapter of the NAACP followed in 1990 with a call for a similar boycott of the chain because of Monaghan's lack of response to the Operation Fair Share Program, which promoted the hiring of blacks. United Auto Workers As the Operations Manager for the Eastern Michigan University Career Services Center, BenDor was involved in the United Auto Workers-Technical Office Professionals Local 1976 in the 1980s and early 1990s, serving as vice president of the local. Michigan Election Reform Alliance BenDor is a founding member of the Michigan Election Reform Alliance (MERA). Its mission is to ensure \\"the realization of election processes that consistently uphold the principles of democracy to ensure the confidence of voters and maximize representation of all citizens of the United States of America.\\" She is currently the statewide coordinator and grants chair. Local government service BenDor served for over a decade as Trustee, Planning Commissioner, and Deputy Township Clerk for Pittsfield Charter Township, where she worked in support of green space preservation, establishment of long term plans for the maintenance of public services, restrictions on predatory lending, election reform, and promotion of voter registration. Local political activism Between 2007 and 2010, BenDor took action to preserve a 77-acre parcel of agricultural land in Superior Township, Michigan, where she lives. The land had attracted interest from developers, who hoped to rezone it and open a privately operated sewage-treatment system on it with the intention of serving a planned 236-home subdivision. BenDor helped to organize opposition to a proposed settlement between the developers and the township, although in 2010 the township agreed to a settlement. She expressed opposition to the decision, which she felt invited future litigation and constituted \\"bailing out\\" the developers. BenDor is the election specialist for the Dearborn-based political advocacy group Michigan Rising, and which in April 2012 targeted Michigan Governor Rick Snyder for recall. In a press release she referred to Snyder as \\"bad for Michigan\\" and accused him of harming the state's children by removing thousands of them from food aid, diminishing the School Aid Fund by $400 million, and reducing school payments. Personal life BenDor currently lives in Ypsilanti, Michigan with her husband, with whom she has two sons. In 2011, she completed a certificate in Digital Video Production at Washtenaw Community College. She currently works as a producer at QED Video. BenDor has worked as an adjunct instructor at the Eastern Michigan University School of Social Work. She continues to be an active supporter of women's rights and local government.

Plot  Skyhook, a small Oregon town, is chosen to be the new headquarters of Neo-Genentrix. Nefarious Thorne, the genocidal CEO, unleashes a genetic experiment that converts most of the inhabitants of Skyhook into zombies. Unsatisfied with anything less than complete domination, Thorne brings in assassins to hunt down the last remaining human, Bob, an alcoholic war hero and survivalist who was initially responsible for inviting Neo-Genentrix in Skyhook. When Bob evades the mercenaries, Thorne himself tracks him down and captures him. However, Bob is able to turn the tables on his captors and stop their plans for world domination.

The building was razed in 1986 and the site paved over for use as a parking lot. The property was later redeveloped as part of the construction of the Union Pacific Railroad's headquarters building.  History  The 2,500-seat theater was designed by John Latenser & Sons for the Blank Realty Company. The general contractor was Calvin Ziegler. The theater was of steel frame construction with concrete and masonry walls. The theater's exterior was of old ivory and terra cotta, with accents of polychrome blues and reds. There were three prominent arches for advertising over the theater's diagonal corner entrance. Features included a nursery with an attendant, a screening room and large orchestra space with a pipe organ. Store fronts were built along the street level and business offices were available on the second level. The total investment in the building and its outfitting was estimated in 1917 at $300,000. Arch Detail, Rialto Theater The theater, built primarily for movies, opened to the public on Memorial Day, May 30, 1918. The inaugural movie was Raffles, the Amateur Cracksman, starring John Barrymore and Evelyn Brent. Initially built for silent movies, the theater was eventually converted to talking movies. The theater closed suddenly on August 2, 1929 and was subsequently sub-divided into several retail establishments. Its later uses included a bus station, a bowling alley, a retail clothing store and a cafeteria before its eventual demolition in February 1986. The theater's large organ was acquired by Omaha Central High School with plans to install it in the school's auditorium. That plan was never executed upon and the organ was later dismantled and sold for scrap. /> Note of interest: In Season 1:Episode 14, “The Phantom of the Horse Opera,” of the television program, “That Girl”, The Rialto theater is mentioned in the dialogue.

Early life Idris Williams was born at Porth Farm on 19 (or 9) April 1836, the third and youngest son of Edward and Jane Williams. At that time, Rhondda was a remote, rural backwater. During his lifetime, Williams witnessed the transformation of the valley into a thriving industrial community. Williams received very little formal education and at the age of nine he went to work as a haulier at George Insole & Son's Cymmer Colliery. At the age of sixteen he was sent to a school in Cardiff and two years later became an apprentice carpenter at Pontypridd. After completing his training he returned to the Cymmer Pit to work as a carpenter in 1854–5. In 1855 he was married to Mary Evans, daughter of the Rev. Joshua Evans of Cymmer. They had six children. Public life Williams supported William Abraham (Mabon) during his successful campaign for election to Parliament in 1885 as Liberal-Labour MP for Rhondda. In 1892 Williams became a Liberal councillor for the Cymmer division of the Glamorgan County Council. Although he lost the popular election he took up the position unopposed a month later when the winning candidate became an alderman. Richard Griffiths, in his study of the commercial life of the Rhondda, speculates that Williams' prominence in the public life of the Rhondda Valley was based on two factors. The first was his connection with the pre-industrial society of the valley as the heir to Porth Farm, an agricultural holding that disappeared with the advent of industrialisation (although the former farmhouse, where his younger brother Levi Williams lived, survived next to the railway station in the centre of Porth). The second factor was the considerable wealth that he accrued after coal mining operations commenced on the land which formerly formed part of the Porth Farm.  Death and legacy  Williams died suddenly in Porth on 4 November 1894 and was buried four days later at the Cymmer Independent Chapel graveyard after \\"a vast concourse of people [had] assembled to pay their last tokens of respect and esteem.\\" References  External links  = Related newspaper and other articles = *Relieving Officer (1860): unsuccessfully sought election as relieving officer for the Rhondda district * (1868): lay-preacher and deacon at Cymmer Independent Chapel, instrumental in arranging a for the Rhondda which led to similar festivals in subsequent years *Pontypridd Board of Governors (1869): elected as relieving officer *Pentre Rhondda (1877): registrar of marriages *Llanwonno (1877): school board election *Ystradyfodwg Burial Board (1879): board member *Congregational Association East Glamorganshire (1880): meeting chair *Glamorgan County Council Election – Cymmer Division (1892): letter to the Editor and response * Glamorgan County Council Triennial Election 1892.

During his 50 years as professor at the University of British Columbia, he wrote over 80 scientific publications as well as several books. He was awarded the title of Professor Emeritus in 1989. In 1990 the Canadian Botanical Association awarded him with the prestigious George Lawson Medal. Bandoni died on May 18, 2009, in Vancouver, British Columbia, after suffering a stroke.  Biography  Robert \\"Bob\\" Joseph Bandoni was born November 9, 1926 in Weeks, Nevada to Giuseppe and Albina Bandoni. He went to high school in Hawthorne, Nevada and received a Bachelor of Science from the University of Nevada in 1953. He then studied under George Willard Martin at the University of Iowa and received his Ph.D. in 1957. The title of his thesis was: \\"Taxonomic studies of the genus Tremella (Tremellaceae). That same year, he received the Gertrude S. Burlingham Fellowship at the New York Botanical Garden and became assistant professor of Botany at the University of Wichita. In 1958 Bandoni joined the Botany faculty at the University of British Columbia (UBC). He helped found the Vancouver Mycological Society in the 1970s. He was awarded the status of professor emeritus in 1989. Bandoni died on May 18, 2009 from a stroke.  Mycological and botanical contributions  Bandoni mainly studied the heterobasidiomycetes, commonly known as the \\"Jelly Fungi\\". His early publications were of a classical taxonomical nature, writing descriptions of the macro- and micro-morphology via the light microscope. In the early 1970s Bandoni started studying aquatic fungi that occur in terrestrial environments. He published a paper in the journal Science that explained how spores can travel upwards on a monolayer of water on a leaf surface. In the 1980s Bandoni collaborated with Franz Oberwinkler and colleagues at the University of Tübingen to produce over 20 papers on the Jelly Fungi and allies. They described new species, genera, families and orders. They used TEM and SEM micrographs to investigate the significance of septal pore structures, began revising the classical phylogenetic classification and to demonstrate parasitism between Jelly Fungi and other fungi. Bandoni collaborated with mycologists in Japan and other Asian countries. He was research fellow in 1983 at the University of Tsukuba and spent a sabbatical year at the University of Osaka. He wrote two field guides to Thailand mushrooms. Bandoni contributed to multiple publications on taxonomy in the Jelly Fungi up until his death. In addition to scientific publications, Bandoni also contributed to several influential books. He contributed to Plant diversity: An evolutionary approach; a book written by the UBC Botany Faculty that \\"put the Botany Department onto the North American textbook bestseller list for almost a decade\\". He also contributed to the 570 page textbook Nonvascular plants: An evolutionary survey. In 1964 he co- authored with Adam Szczawinski a field guide titled Guide to common mushrooms of British Columbia.

Though never common, it is widespread in tropical Africa and arid regions, being absent from high-rainfall regions.  Distribution  It is found in Togo, Sudan, Eritrea, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda, Chad, Ghana, Mali, Mauritania, Cameroon, Kenya, Burundi, Rwanda, Niger, Nigeria, The Gambia, Burkina Faso extending southwards into Angola, Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Caprivi Strip, Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland and Mozambique.\\"The Indigenous Trees of Southern Africa\\" - F. von Breitenbach (1965) The genus comprises some 57 species, mostly in tropical Africa, but also extending into the Middle East and tropical Asia.  Description  The tree has a rounded crown and smooth grey bark flaking to reveal yellowish-orange patches. As with most species in the family the twigs and branches display prominent lenticels. Leaves are soft and drooping, with petioles equal to the leaves in length, and visibly thicker or inspissate at their extremities. Leaves are alternate and broadly elliptic to ovate, with rounded or notched apex and a terminal bristle (mucronate). Leaf surfaces are often noticeably scratched by their rubbing against the bristles of surrounding leaves. The species is variable as regards pubescence, ranging from entirely glabrous to pubescent on stems and leaves. The fragrant, pincushion-like flowers are without petals and are produced in abundance at the beginning of the rainy season. Filaments are numerous (c.50) and long, initially pale yellow then turning darker with age. The 4 calyx segments recurve on opening, and the base is fringed with hairs. The distinctive torulose fruit is a silique and resembles a string of beads some 150mm in length. A slender, taller version of this species growing in the Socotra archipelago, Somalia, Ethiopia and Yemen has been named Maerua angolensis subsp. socotrana (Schweinf. ex Balf. f.) Kers. M. angolensis is similar to M. schinzii Pax. from Namibia, which has thicker, almost fleshy leaves and other relatively trivial differences. The wood of this species is whitish-yellow, hard, dense and fine-grained, with a tendency to separate into concentric shells along the annual rings.  Uses  Despite their unpleasant, bitter taste, the leaves are used by African rural tribes during famine periods as a food supplement, and also used as a purgative.\\"Medicinal and Poisonous Plants of Southern and Eastern Africa\\" - Watt & Brandwijk (1962) Powdered leaves are used as a fish poison and to treat anorexia and asthenia, while bark extracts and pulped leaves are used to promote the healing of wounds. Decoctions of the leaves are given to children suffering amoebic dysentery or jaundice, and to treat rheumatism, stomach-ache, epilepsy and diarrhoea, while decoctions of the bark are used to treat malaria and as an aphrodisiac. Game and livestock readily browse the foliage. This species, in common with other members of the family, is host to butterflies of the family Pieridae. Instar larvae may defoliate a tree completely, but leaves regrow readily.\\"Plant Resources of Tropical Africa\\" - Schmelzer, G.H. & Gurib-Fakim, A (2013) Phytochemical analysis of the bark revealed glycosides, terpenes, tannins, flavonoids, saponins, carbohydrates, proteins, alkaloids and other constituents. Further studies suggested that the bark is non-toxic in anti- inflammatory doses, supporting ethnomedical use of the plant in managing inflammation.http://www.abu.edu.ng/njps/pdf/22.pdf  References   Citations  Prodr. 1: 254 (1824) — Sim, For.

The book, has since then become a New York Times Bestseller. Kleon presents himself as a young writer and artist emphasizing that creativity is everywhere and is for everyone. In his own words, \\"You don’t need to be a genius, you just need to be yourself\\". Kleon points out that no artist's work is ever completely original, and that trying to be completely original will daunt an artist and eventually smothers his creativity. He suggests artists embrace the inevitability of influence, to celebrate living outside of a vacuum, to relax, and have fun with their art. Beyond that, he also goes on to offer tips on how to stay focused, upbeat, and be receptive to incoming inspiration.The Author's Page Backdrop When Mr. Kleon was asked to address college students at Broome Community College in upstate New York in 2011, he shaped his speech around a simple list of ten things he wished someone had told him when he was starting out at their age. They were: 'Steal like an artist; Don't wait until you know who you are to start making things; Write the book you want to read; Use your hands; Side projects are important; Do good work and put it where people can see it; Geography is no longer our master; Be nice (the world is a small town.); Be boring (it's the only way to get work done.); and, Creativity is subtraction. After giving the speech, he posted the text and slides of the talk to his popular blog.Google Books Reviews The talk went viral, and Kleon dug deeper and expanded to create the book, for anyone attempting to make things - art, a career, a life - in the digital age. The Book Kleon describes ten basic principles to boost your creativity. He lists them on the back cover of the book so that they're easily referenced. The book is small, full of illustrations and several poems in the style of his newspaper cutouts by Kleon. Kleon responds by writing, “the reason to copy your heroes and their style is so that you might somehow get a glimpse into their minds\\". Kleon reminds throughout his book that “nothing is original… all creative work builds on what came before.” This sentiment is also a foundation for effective ELA teaching: From our past experiences as readers and writers, we can design better learning conditions for our students.Austin Kleon on 10 Things Every Creator Should Remember But We Often Forget, Brain Pickings, Retrieved 8 March 2012 Each chapter is dedicated to one of the ten principles, which are represented by the following: 1\\\\. Steal like an artist: The author cautions that he does not mean ‘steal’ as in plagiarise, skim or rip off — but study, credit, remix, mash up and transform. Creative work builds on what came before, and thus nothing is completely original. 2\\\\. Don't wait until you know who you are to start making things: You have to start doing the work you want to be doing, you have to immerse, internalise and even dress like the person you aspire to be. “You don’t have to look like your heroes, you want to see like your heroes,” Kleon urges. Go beyond imitation to emulation. 3\\\\. Write the book you want to read: It is important to do what you want to do, and insert your take on things of art. 4\\\\. Use your hands: It is important to step away from the screen and immerse in actual physical work. “Computers have robbed us of the feeling that we’re actually making things,” Kleon cautions. \\"Involve your full body, and not just your brains.\\" 5\\\\. Side projects are important: Hobbies are important because they keep you happy. “A hobby is something that gives but doesn’t take,” Kleon says. 6\\\\. Do good work and put it where people can see it: Sharing your work and even your thoughts about what you like help you get good feedback and more ideas. 7\\\\. Geography is no longer our master: “Travel makes the world look new, and when the world looks new, our brains work harder,” Kleon explains. Constraints can also act favorably – bad winters or summers can force you to be indoors and work on your projects. 8\\\\. Be nice (the world is a small town.): Stop fighting and channel your rage into a creative pursuit. Show appreciation for the good things you see around you. 9\\\\. Be boring (it's the only way to get work done.): You can’t be creative all the time, so set a routine – for example, with a regular day job which sets a fixed schedule and exposes you to new people and skills. 10\\\\. Creativity is subtraction\\": In an age of information overload and abundance, focus is important. Choose what you want to leave out of your key work. “Nothing is more paralysing than the idea of limitless possibilities. The best way to get over creative block is to simply place some constraints on yourself,” Kleon says.Austin Kleon: Steal Like An Artist, TEDxKC (TEDx Kansas City). Retrieved April 24, 2012.

It contains a single species, Nanuqsaurus hoglundi, known only from a partial skull. Description Restoration of the head Nanuqsaurus has been estimated to have been about 5-6 meters (16-20 ft) long, about half the length of Tyrannosaurus rex.Molina-Pérez & Larramendi 2016. Récords y curiosidades de los dinosaurios Terópodos y otros dinosauromorfos, Larousse. Barcelona, Spain p. 259http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/03/140313-new-species- dinosaurs-tyrannosaurus-rex-animals-science/ Its weight has been estimated to be 500-900 kilograms (1100-2000 lbs). This diminutive size was postulated by Fiorillo and Tykoski as being an adaptation to its high-latitude habitat. Nanuqsaurus bears a particularly shaped ridge on its head indicating the carnivore was related to Tyrannosaurus rex. The length of the reconstructed skull, based on the proportions of related animals, is . Classified as a tyrannosaurine, Nanuqsaurus is diagnosed by: a thin, rostrally forked, median spur of the fused parietals on the dorsal skull roof that overlaps and separates the frontals within the sagittal crest, frontals with a long, rostrally pointed process separating the prefrontal and lacrimal facets and that the first two dentary teeth are much smaller than the dentary teeth behind them. Discovery and naming In 2006, at the Kikak-Tegoseak Quarry, in North Slope Borough in the north of Alaska, fossils were found of a medium- sized theropod, with an estimated skull length of . These were first referred to Gorgosaurus and later to Albertosaurus. After preparation in the Perot Museum of Nature and Science (Dallas Museum of Natural History) it was recognised these represented a species new to science. The holotype, DMNH 21461, has been found in a layer of the Prince Creek Formation, dated at 69.1 million years. It consists of a partial skull with a lower jaw, which were found very close together. It contains the nasal branch of the right maxilla; a partial skull roof including partial parietals, frontals and a right laterosphenoid; and the front of the left dentary. The specimen is from a fully mature individual, as it has a smooth nasal contact. Nanuqsaurus was first described and named by Anthony R. Fiorillo and Ronald S. Tykoski in 2014. The type species is Nanuqsaurus hoglundi. The generic name is derived from the Iñupiaq word for \\"polar bear\\", nanuq, and the Greek word sauros, meaning \\"lizard\\". The specific name honours the philanthropist Forrest Hoglund, for his work on philanthropy and cultural institutions. Classification Holotype fossils Size of Nanuqsaurus (A, blue) compared to other theropods. Nanuqsaurus is a highly derived tyrannosaurine. It is considered the sister taxon to a clade containing Tyrannosaurus, Tarbosaurus, and probably Zhuchengtyrannus. Below is a cladogram illustrating the relationships of all tyrannosaurid genera: Paleobiology CT slice through the partial left dentary, showing the replacement teeth present in the jaw bone According to paleontologists, about 70 million years ago northern Alaska was a part of an ancient subcontinent called Laramidia and experienced cold weather and long periods of darkness and light, in addition to seasons in which food was not readily available. Prey availability likely would have increased suddenly during the summer, but then declined in the dark winter, leaving predators with little to eat. Fiorillo stated that this lack of food might explain Nanuqsaurus's unusually small size, as a large animal cannot survive on scarce resources. However, it was also found that the normal length of Troodon increased by 50% in Alaska, although it was speculated this was caused by a larger eye size, leading to better competition. Nanuqsaurus likely shrank in size because of the decrease in year-round food supply, caused by the colder temperatures. =Senses= The shape of its skull suggested it had an inflated area of its brain devoted to smell, which suggests the animal relied heavily on scent to hunt its prey, similar to Tyrannosaurus rex. The heightened sense of smell in tyrannosaurines suggests that it is more likely that they actively hunted prey instead of scavenging carcasses. Paleoecology Nanuqsaurus in its environment The holotype specimen assigned to Nanuqsaurus comes from the Maastrichtian age Prince Creek Formation. At an age of 71–68 million years ago, the Kikak-Tegoseak Quarry region Prince Creek Formation dates to the early Late Maastrichtian. An average age found in dating rocks from the formation is 69.1 ± 0.3 million years ago, so it is likely that Nanuqsaurus is from around that age. The formation is along the Colville River on the North Slope Borough, and is made up of alluvial sediments. It is one of a few dinosaurs to live at very high-latitude areas.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. History The design of the complex has been described as \\"...done up with turrets and battlements the way Mad King Ludwig of Bavaria might have done it, if he had been a St. Louis beer brewer.\\" It was built with funding from San Antonio businessmen John H. Kampmann and Edward Hope, as well as St. Louis businessman Adolphus Busch, who was president of the Lone Star Brewing Company. In 1920 the 18th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the resulting Volstead Act prohibited alcoholic beverages in the country. During this period, the brewery housed the Lone Star Cotton Mills. Prohibition ended in the United States in 1933 when the 21st Amendment to the U.S. Constitution repealed the 18th Amendment. However, by that time the building had been temporarily abandoned, and the original brewery owners never occupied it again. The Lone Star name was taken over by a new company that opened a plant at 400 Lone Star Boulevard in San Antonio. The complex was occupied by several different businesses for three decades until it was sold to the San Antonio Museum Association in the 1970s. It is currently home to the San Antonio Museum of Art. Building details Albert Beckmann and James Wahrenberger were supervising architects for E. Jugenfeld and Company when it designed and oversaw the construction of the brewery. The complex on the original NRHP designation is the 2-story attached central building, with an overhead 4th story bridge joining the east and west wings The attached east wing is a 5-story building, attached to a 4-story building. The attached west wing is more complex, with a 4-story building, attached to a 5-story building with a tower rising from the top of it. Next to that are two 1-story buildings joined in the middle by a 3-story building. There is a 2-story detached office building. To the rear of the main building are detached service buildings and a courtyard for employees and visitors. A National Register of Historic Places boundary increase in 1979 added four structures that had been left off the 1972 designation due to resistance from the owner of the property. When the owner sold the property to the San Antonio Museum Association, the National Register of Historic Places was cleared to add the increase. Included in the increase were the 2-1/2-story boiler and equipment room, the 2-story ice manufacturing plant, the 2-story horse stable and vehicle storage, and the 1-story employee wash house.

Background The previous year, De La Hoya had lost the WBC welterweight title to Felix Trinidad. De La Hoya's first loss as a professional was met with controversy, as De La Hoya seemed to be in control for most of the fight's first eight rounds. However, at the urging of his corner, De La Hoya took a more defensive approach in the later rounds, leading to Trinidad taking all of the final four rounds on the scorecards and a majority decision victory. De La Hoya demanded a rematch, but an agreement was never reached\\"I Demand a Rematch\\", L.A. Times article, 1999-09-23, Retrieved on 2014-03-12 Instead, De La Hoya took an \\"eliminator\\" bout with Derrell Coley, who was the number one ranked welterweight fighter by the WBC.

Times article, 2000-03-11, Retrieved on 2014-03-12 Mosley was undefeated 34 professional bouts and had previously fought in the lightweight division where he had been the IBF champion from 1997 to 1999 before relinquishing the title in September 1999 to move up to welterweight. At the time of his fight with De La Hoya, Mosley had only two welterweight fights to his credit, and as such, came into the fight as a 2-1 betting underdog. Nevertheless, Mosley was guaranteed no less than $4.5 million, the highest purse of his career at the time, while De La Hoya was set to earn $15 million.For De La Hoya, Mosley Now Smiles Have Vanished, Philadelphia Inquirer article, 2000-06-17, Retrieved on 2014-03-12 The fight In a closely contested fight, Mosley would earn a narrow split decision victory to become only the sixth fighter (at the time) to win titles in both the lightweight and welterweight divisions. Two judges scored the fight for Mosley with scores of 116–112 and 115–113, while the third had De La Hoya the winner with a score of 115–113. HBO's unofficial scorer Harold Lederman also ruled in favor of Mosley with a score of 116–112. De La Hoya had a slight edge during some of the bout's early rounds, but as the fight went to the later rounds, De La Hoya seemed to tire and the fight began to turn in Mosley's favor. Mosley rallied to take rounds seven through 12 on one of the scorecards and five of the last six on the other, often scoring punches in flurries to win those rounds, which proved to be the difference in the fight.Mosley Takes De La Hoya's Title on Split Decision, N.Y.

De La Hoya was only nine power punches short of Mosley, having landed 165, but at only a 37% success rate. Aftermath Like his fight against Trinidad, De La Hoya felt that he had won the fight and called for a rematch in his post- fight interview.

To do so, he would have needed to oust incumbent Arnold-Jones in winning the Republican ticket, then win the popular vote after gaining the GOP nomination. His campaign was managed by Rhead Story, another local Republican politician. In Smith's announcement he stated \\"The people of New Mexico are hurting... New Mexicans need a congressman who will be honest and straightforward with them and who will be focused on creating solutions to the problems facing our nation and our great state.\\" At the Republican pre-primary convention on March 17, 2012, incumbent Arnold-Jones was challenged by then Albuquerque City Councilman Dan Lewis and Smith. Arnold-Jones took 62% of the vote, with Lewis following at 33% and Smith garnering 4%. The Washington Post stated Smith \\"wasn't even close to defeating\\" Arnold-Jones. A complaint was raised by Arnold-Jones that stated some of Smith's nomination petition signatures were invalid. Smith would have had to have gathered 1,579 signatures to qualify for the Republican nomination ballot. Responding to the complaint, Judge C. Shannon Bacon ruled that some of the signatures were indeed invalid, thus disqualifying Smith from the race. Of the 1,823 Smith gathered, 492 were deemed invalid, meaning he needed 248 more signatures. Signatures can be considered invalid if \\"signers either were duplicates from other petitions, registered in another district or not registered as Republicans.\\" With Lewis withdrawing from the race and Smith being disqualified, Arnold-Jones was granted the GOP ticket by default. Eventually, Arnold-Jones lost the seat to Democrat Michelle Lujan Grisham in the popular election. Arnold-Jones was defeated ~59% to ~41%. In total, Smith spent nearly $300,000.00USD on his congressional campaign, with most of that amount being his personal funds. The exact amount came to $296,951. Following the election, Smith was arrested for stalking of Arnold-Jones after being caught on surveillance video slashing tires at the candidate's residence.

The city was incorporated in 1748. It was occupied by the British during the American Revolutionary War, and General Phillips died of fever at Blandford during bombardment from the Marquis de Lafayette's positions north of the river. After the war, it became a destination for many free blacks in Virginia, as well as a growing hub for railroads. By 1860, it was the second largest city in Virginia. For nine months in 1864 and 1865 it was the subject of the Siege of Petersburg; the fall of the city unleashed a chain of events over the following two weeks that resulted in the end of the American Civil War. After the war, it again flourished as a destination for Freedmen. Petersburg was a notable focal point in the organization of the Civil Rights Movement in the mid-20th century. In the late 20th century, the city suffered significant economic decline. Indigenous people In 2006 archaeological excavations at Pocahontas Island found evidence of prehistoric Native American settlement dated to 6500 B.C. This is in the early third of the Archaic Period (8000 to 1000 BC). Varying cultures of indigenous peoples lived in the area for thousands of years. When the English arrived in Virginia in 1607, the region was occupied by the Appamatuck, a significant tribe of the Powhatan Confederacy. They were governed by a weroance, King Coquonosum, and by his sister, Queen Opossunoquonuske. This Algonquian-speaking people later had a town at Rohoic Creek (formerly Rohowick or Indian Towne Run), on the western edge of present-day Petersburg. Colonial period Archaeological excavation at the site of the 18th-century Golden Ball Tavern Petersburg was founded and settled by English colonists. By 1635 they had patented land along the south bank of the Appomattox River as far west as present-day Sycamore Street, and about inland. In 1646, the Virginia Colony established Fort Henry a short distance from the Appamatuck town, near the falls. Col. Abraham Wood sent several famous expeditions out from here in the following years to explore points to the west, as far as the Appalachian Mountains. Some time around 1675, Wood's son-in-law, Peter Jones, who then commanded the fort and traded with the Indians, opened a trading post nearby, known as Peter's Point. The Bolling family, prominent tobacco planters and traders, also lived in the area from the early 18th century. In 1733, Col. William Byrd II (who founded Richmond at the same time) conceived plans for a city at Peter's Point, to be renamed Petersburgh. The Virginia General Assembly formally incorporated both Petersburg and adjacent Blandford on December 17, 1748. Wittontown, north of the river, was settled in 1749, and became incorporated as Pocahontas in 1752. Petersburg was enlarged slightly in 1762, adding to \\"Old Town\\".James H. Bailey, Old Petersburg, p. 16. During the American Revolutionary War, the British drive to regain control erupted in the Battle of Blanford in 1781, which started just east of Petersburg. As the Americans retreated north across the Appomattox River, they took up the planks of the Pocahontas bridge to delay the enemy. Although the British drove the Americans from Blanford and Petersburg, they did not regain a strategic advantage in the war. Cornwallis' forces surrendered at Yorktown soon after this battle. Antebellum period After the Revolutionary War, in 1784 Petersburg annexed the adjacent towns of Blandford (also called Blanford) and Pocahontas and the suburb of Ravenscroft, which became neighborhoods of the city. In 1790 its population totaled 2,828, making it one of the largest settlements in the country. An area known as Gillfield was annexed in 1798.James H. Bailey, Old Petersburg, p. 17. In the first two decades after the war, inspired by the Revolution's principles of equality, numerous Virginia slaveholders manumitted their slaves. Some of those freed were the mixed-race \\"natural children\\" of white planters, born to enslaved mothers outside of legal marriage. The number of free blacks in Virginia rose markedly between 1782 and 1810. Because of the availability of jobs in Petersburg, many free people of color in Virginia migrated to the growing urban community. They established First Baptist (1774) and Gillfield Baptist Church (1797), the first and second oldest black congregations in the city and two of the oldest in the nation.\\"Gillfield Baptist Church, Petersburg, VA\\" , Virginia Commonwealth University Library, 2008, accessed 22 December 2008\\"First Baptist Church, Petersburg\\", African American Heritage, accessed 22 December 2008 The black churches were the first Baptist churches established in Petersburg.Albert J. Raboteau, Slave Religion: The 'Invisible Institution' in the Antebellum South, Oxford University Press, p. 137, accessed 27 December 2008 For years the center of the free black residential area was Pocahontas Island, a peninsula on the north shore of the Appomattox River. With access to waterways and a sympathetic population, this neighborhood was an important site on the Underground Railroad. Two surviving houses in the Pocahontas Island Historic District are associated with it.Henry Chase, \\"Proud, free and black: Petersburg - visiting the Virginia location of the largest number of 19th century free [blacks]\\", American Visions, Jun-Jul 1994, accessed 27 December 2008 The Pocahontas Island Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 3, 2006. The Pocahontas Island Black History Museum, established in 2003 by Richard Stewart, is located on Pocahontas Island. It was once a stop on the Underground Railroad, and features artifacts and other historical items from over 200 years of black history.\\"Petersburg: Pocahontas Island Historic District\\", National Park Service, accessed 1 July 2018 The Port of Petersburg became renowned as a commercial center for processing cotton, tobacco and metal, then shipping products out of the region. The city became an important industrial center in a mostly agricultural state with few major cities. Residents' devotion to the cause during the War of 1812 led to the formation of the Petersburg Volunteers—who distinguished themselves in action at the Siege of Fort Meigs on May 5, 1813. President James Madison called Petersburg \\"Cockade of the Union\\" (or \\"Cockade City\\"), in honor of the cockades which Volunteers wore on their caps.James H. Bailey, Old Petersburg, p. 18-19. In 1815, a fire destroyed much of the business district. Flourishing businesses helped the city make improvements. Starting in 1813, the city paved its streets. A development company created a canal to bypass the Appomattox Falls. Next came railroad lines to link the city to all points of the compass. As travel technology developed in the mid-19th century, Petersburg became established as a railroad center, with lines completed to Richmond to the north, Farmville and Lynchburg to the west, and Weldon, North Carolina to the south. The last major line was completed in 1858 to the east, with the Norfolk and Petersburg Railroad connecting to an ocean port. In 1851 the city introduced gas lighting and by 1857 installed a new municipal water system. All these civic improvements helped attract and hold a substantial business community, based on manufacture of tobacco products, but also including cotton and flour mills, and banking. Civil War Christ Church in Petersburg, 1865 At the time of the American Civil War, Petersburg was the second largest city in Virginia, and the seventh-largest city in the Confederacy. Its 1860 population was 18,266, half of whom were black. Free blacks numbered 3,224 (one-third) and had been attracted to the city for the opportunities in industries and trades.\\"National Register Nominations: Pocahontas Island Historic District\\", Heritage Matters, Jan-Feb 2008, National Park Service, accessed 30 December 2008 Petersburg's population had the highest percentage of free African Americans of any city in the Confederacy and the largest number of free blacks in the Mid-Atlantic. Many had settled on Pocahontas Island. Because of its significant past and prehistoric archaeological evidence, the Pocahontas Island Historic District is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Ninety percent of the population are native Virginians, as most of their ancestors had been in the state since the 17th and 18th centuries. When the Civil War began in 1861, Petersburg was strategic. The city provided several infantry companies and artillery units to the Confederate Army, along three troops of cavalry. In April 1861 more than 300 free Petersburg African Americans volunteered to work on the fortifications of Norfolk, Virginia under their own leader. Slaveholders also contributed the labor of numerous black slaves.\\"Black Confederate Soldiers of Petersburg\\", Petersburg Express, accessed 22 December 2008 In 1864, Petersburg became a target during the Overland Campaign of Union General Ulysses S. Grant. The numerous railroads made Petersburg a lifeline for Richmond, the Confederate capital. The depot at Pocahontas Island, built for the Richmond & Petersburg rail line, was a transit point for Confederate troops and supplies. Ruins of pre-war slave quarters on the Petersburg Battlefield Petersburg was the headquarters of the Confederate Army's Second Regiment of Engineers, whose members included Benjamin Morgan Harrod, a Harvard-trained civil engineer who later designed the water and sewer systems of his native New Orleans, Louisiana. After his defeat at the Battle of Cold Harbor, Grant remained east of Richmond and moved south to Petersburg. Grant intended to cut the rail lines into Petersburg, stopping Richmond's supplies. On June 9, troops led by William F. \\"Baldy\\" Smith of the 18th Corps, attacked the Dimmock Line, a series of defensive breastworks constructed in 1861 and 1862 to protect Petersburg against the Army of the Potomac under General George McClellan during the Peninsula Campaign. The Confederate troops numbered only 2,000, but Smith and Winfield S. Hancock were hesitant to attack the fortified line. Confederate General P.G.T. Beauregard informed Lee that he was facing virtually the entire the Army of the Potomac with his few defenders at Petersburg. Lee arrived with the fabled Army of Northern Virginia, and the 292-day Siege of Petersburg began. Lee himself admitted that the South could not win a siege war. The trench lines on the east of Petersburg were close together. A soldier in the 48th Pennsylvania Infantry of the Union Army IX Corp, a coal miner in civilian life, remarked, \\"We could blow that battery into oblivion if we could dig a mine underneath it.\\" Colonel Henry Pleasants, his division commander, liked the idea and forwarded it up the chain of command. Grant gave his approval. On July 30, the explosives in the tunnel were detonated. Due to botched Union leadership and arrival of Confederate General William Mahone, the Union forces suffered a disastrous defeat at the Battle of the Crater, suffering over 4,000 casualties. The battle was portrayed in the film Cold Mountain (2003). By the end of the war, the city was ringed with a series of fortifications. In early April 1865, Union troops finally managed to push their left flank to the railroad to Weldon, North Carolina and the Southside Railroad. With the loss of Petersburg's crucial lifelines, the Confederate forces had to retreat, ending the siege in a victory for the Union Army. The fall of Petersburg meant that Richmond could no longer be defended, Lee attempted to lead his men south to join up with Confederate forces in North Carolina. Hopelessly outnumbered, he was surrounded and forced to surrender at Appomattox Court House, Virginia, on April 9, 1865. Confederate General Ambrose P. (A.P.) Hill died on the last day the Confederates held the Petersburg trenches. Petersburg established a warfare precedent. During World War I the armies on both sides used trenches extensively in Europe (q.v. trench warfare). Reconstruction era South Side Railroad Depot on Rock Street which served as the office of William Mahone when his Readjustor Party dominated Virginia politics The Freedmen's Bureau established new facilities for freedmen, including a mental health hospital in December 1869, at Howard's Grove Hospital, a former Confederate unit. In 1870 the General Assembly incorporated the Central Lunatic Asylum as an organized state institution, as part of an effort by the Reconstruction-era legislature to increase public institutions for general welfare. The legislature also founded the state's first system of free public education. In the years after the Civil War, many freedmen migrated to Petersburg for rebuilding, work on the river, and to escape the white control prevalent in more rural areas. They found numerous churches, businesses and institutions founded by free blacks, and added new energy to the community. In 1874 James M. Wilkerson, Sr. founded the Wilkerson Undertaking Company. It continues to operate as the James M. Wilkerson Funeral Establishment, Inc. and is one of the oldest black-owned firms in the United States. Although in the 1870s, conservative whites took power in the state and began to legislate racial segregation, African Americans continued to create their own businesses and community organizations in Petersburg. During the 1880s, a coalition of black Republicans and white Populists held power for several years in the state legislature. This resulted in two major public institutions in Petersburg, as the legislature invested for education and welfare. In 1882, the legislature founded Virginia State University in nearby Ettrick as Virginia Normal and Collegiate Institute. It was one of the first public (fully state-supported) four-year historically black colleges and universities (HBCU) in the Mid-Atlantic. This was part of a drive to improve public education that started with the Reconstruction legislature.\\"Civil War history lesson: Petersburg, Va., embraces and expands its past\\", Boston.com, 9 March 2005, accessed 22 December 2008 John Mercer Langston, a national political leader and former dean of Howard University's law department, was selected as the college's first president.William Cheek and Aimee Lee Cheek, \\"John Mercer Langston: Principle and Politics\\", in Leon F. Litwack and August Meier, eds., Black Leaders of the Nineteenth Century, University of Illinois, 1991 An Oberlin College graduate, he was an accomplished attorney who had been a leader of abolitionists in Ohio and held national appointments. In 1888, Langston was elected to the US Congress on the Republican ticket, the first African American to be elected to Congress from Virginia. He was also the last for nearly a century. Also in 1882, the state legislature authorized moving the asylum facility to the Mayfield Farm and developing a new campus there. This is the site of the present-day Central State Hospital, which provides a variety of mental health services. 20th century The limitations of Petersburg's small geographic area and proximity to Richmond were structural problems which hampered it in adapting to major economic changes in the 20th century. Other forces in the mid-20th century acted to pull people and jobs from the city. It suffered from competition with nearby Richmond, which grew to dominate the region in a changing economy as industries restructured. World wars led to major federal institutions being constructed at Petersburg, which created local jobs. Soon after World War I started, the US Army established Camp Lee for training draftees. The facility was used again during World War II. In 1950 the camp was designated Fort Lee, and additional buildings were constructed to house the U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps Center and School. In the late 19th and early 20th century, Virginia's conservative white Democratic Party–dominated legislature instituted Jim Crow laws, including imposing racial segregation. It also approved constitutional changes that effectively disfranchised most blacks and many poor whites. Those disfranchised suffered major losses in the ability to exercise their rights as citizens. For instance, without being able to vote, they could not serve on juries or be appointed to certain offices. The white legislature consistently underfunded services and schools for blacks. With many African Americans having served the nation and cause of freedom in WWII, in the postwar years they pressed for social justice, an end to segregation and restoration of voting power. Even after the Great Migration of blacks to northern jobs and cities, Petersburg was 40 percent black in 1960. Those citizens were barred from free use of public spaces and facilities.Freedom Riders: 1961 and the Struggle for Racial Justice Raymond Arsenault, New York: Oxford University Press, 2006, p.115 Major black churches, such as First Baptist and Gillfield Baptist, formed the moral center of the Civil Rights Movement in Petersburg, which gained strength in mid-century and was a major center of action. Dr. Wyatt Tee Walker, the pastor of Gillfield Baptist Church, had become friends with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in the early 1950s when they were both in divinity school. In 1957 they co-founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), an important force for leadership of the movement in the South. Walker also founded the Petersburg Improvement Association (PIA), modeled on the Montgomery Improvement Association in Alabama.\\"Inventory of the Wyatt Tee Walker Papers, 1963-1982, n.d.\\", Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York Public Library, 2000, accessed 31 December 2008 According to Walker and other close associates of King, Petersburg had played an important role, a kind of blueprint for the national civil rights struggle. King spent time in the city on several occasions in the 1950s and 60s, and several of his top lieutenants were recruited from the local movement.\\"King, Petersburg has special connection\\", Feb 15 2009 Progress Index African Americans in Petersburg struggled, with federal government support, to desegregate public schools and facilities. Through sit-ins in the bus terminal in 1960, the PIA gained agreement by the president of the Bus Terminal Restaurants to desegregate lunch counters in Petersburg and several other cities.Raymond Arsenault, Freedom Riders: 1961 and the Struggle for Racial Justice, New York: Oxford University Press, 2006, p. 115 Virginia officials at the top levels resisted school integration and initiated the program of Massive Resistance. For instance, rather than integrate, the school board of neighboring Prince Edward County closed public schools for five years, starting in 1959. In the 1950s, Petersburg became the southern terminus of the Richmond-Petersburg Turnpike, predating the U.S. Interstate Highway System. In 1958 Petersburg was named an \\"All American City\\" for its quality of life. In 1970, Carrie E. Miles, from Ward One-Blandford, became the first African- American Women to hold a seat on the Petersburg Public Schools Board of Education since Reconstruction. Retail and industry prospered there until about the early 1980s. De-industrialization and structural economic changes cost many jobs in the city, as happened in numerous older industrial cities across the North and Midwest. The postwar national movement of highway construction and suburbanization added to problems. Many middle-class families moved to newer housing in the suburbs and to nearby Richmond, where the economy was expanding with jobs in fields of financial and retail services. Some companies moved industrial jobs to states further south, where wages were lower, or out of the country altogether. Without sufficient jobs and decreasing middle-class population, city progress slowed. The declining economy increased the pressure of competition and racial tensions. These flared from 1968 to 1980. Following the assassination of King in 1968, Petersburg was the first city to designate his birthday as a holiday, an observance that is now a national holiday. Henry Chase, \\"Proud, free and black: Petersburg - visiting the Virginia location of the largest number of 19th century free slaves\\", American Visions, Jun-Jul 1994, accessed 27 December 2008 Regional tensions were heightened by the city's two large annexations of adjacent portions of Dinwiddie and Prince George Counties in the early 1970s. Despite the large addition of suburban school-age children, a downward trend in public school enrollment continued. Projected industrial development of large tracts of vacant land in the annexed areas did not materialize. In 1985 city leaders were unable to keep Brown & Williamson tobacco company, a top employer, from relocating to Macon, Georgia. The company, disappointed in the city council's vote to raise taxes on tools and machinery, relocated to a market with lower taxes. Partially due to the vacant land still available for potential industrial development, which had been used as justification for the earlier annexations, in 1986 the city failed in its attempt to annex a large section of neighboring Prince George County. It had hoped to enlarge its area for schools and tax base. When negotiations soured in 1989 to build a new regional mall in Petersburg, the city suffered an economic setback. Numerous remaining retail merchants relocated to the new Southpark Mall area in adjacent Colonial Heights. In a typical postwar US pattern, suburban development through the late 20th century drew off retail from the former downtown area. It was once vibrant near the north end of Sycamore Street but had declined by the late 20th century because of structural changes in industries, and loss of local jobs and customers. 21st century city market has been preserved and is still used as a market. In the early 21st century, Petersburg leaders are highlighting its attractive historical and industrial sites, with associated access to an exceptionally wide transportation network. As of 2007, Petersburg continued to evolve as a small city, even as the nature of its commercial activities changed. Downtown Petersburg, known as Old Towne, began experiencing a rebirth. The Army has substantially expanded activities at nearby Fort Lee, home of the United States Army's Sustainment Center of Excellence, as well as the Army's Logistics Branch, Ordnance, Quartermaster, and Transportation Corps.

The accident data recorder (ADR, German commonly abbr.: UDS, also accident (data) writer), in Switzerland also Restwegaufzeichnungsgerät (abbr.: RAG), is an independent electronic device that records before, during, and after a traffic accident relevant data and thus resembles a flight recorder. It can be installed in motor vehicles (cars, trucks, buses, motorcycles, trams, and special vehicles) on a voluntary basis in order to obtain more accurate information about the events in an accident. In some countries there are regulations for mandatory installation in different vehicles. The accident data recorder constantly records various data of the vehicle (such as speed, direction of travel, longitudinal and transverse vehicle acceleration, status of the lights, turn signals and braking, etc.) and records them for some time before they are automatically cleared. In the case of an accident (this is detected by a strong acceleration of the vehicle as a result of an impulse), certain periods of time (usually in the two-digit seconds range) remain permanently stored before and after an event. This makes it much easier to reconstruct events after an accident, so that if necessary the question of fault can be clarified. Many vehicles of authorities (such as police or ambulance) are equipped with it, as it often comes to disputes with collisions during driving with blues and twos about compliance with regulations. A side effect of vehicles equipped with UDS is that drivers behave more cautiously on the road.http://motorzeitung.de/news.php?newsid=482247 According to a survey by the EU Transport Commission, UDS users experienced a 20 to 30 percent decline in traffic accidents. The accident data recorder is often used by experts or institutions in crash tests as a measuring device. Accident data recorder UDS- AT (third generation) Crash Recorder The installation (also later) costs about 700 euros and can lead to a deduction for some insurance policies. The accident data recorder can be read by an expert via interface cable. The accident data recorder (older generations) has a switch with which the driver can delete the stored data immediately after an accident so as not to burden himself with the later question of guilt. However, this feature may be disabled, for example for use in company vehicles.  Technology  Accident data recorders work to measure the accelerations, depending on the equipment in two or three spatial directions, with micromechanical sensors. Often several sensor systems with different resolutions are used in order to be able to log the driving dynamic processes on the one hand and the collision dynamics themselves on the other. Higher-class systems also offer a possibility for measuring the rotational movements as well as the vehicle speed. The latter can e.g. be calculated from the signal of the vehicle's wheel speed sensor. The recording of any signals that are available on the vehicle's own CAN bus, is possible with higher-class devices as well as the detection of a GPS signal for position and speed determination. Depending on the manufacturer, about 20 to 30 s are recorded before and 10 to 15 s after an event. Are known today (as of 2018) in the German-speaking countries essentially two suitable for retrofitting accident data recorder. Blacktrack Ltd. offers a low-cost solution, which is mainly used by the insurance industry (e.g. AXA Winterthur in Switzerland). By contrast, the UDS-AT developed by the company consortium Peter Systemtechnik GmbH and Kast GmbH offers extended possibilities of recording and integration into a vehicle.https://www.colliseum.net/wiki/UDS-AT Residual path recording devices (RAG) from Mobatime AG are external devices that rely on existing on-board signals (distance, speed, operating states of status inputs) and store them in a ring buffer for at least the last 12 km.https://www.mobatime.ch/de/fahrzeuggerate/datenaufzeichnungsgeraete/restwegaufzeichnung/rag-2000 In contrast to an accident data recorder, they do not have their own measuring sensors.  Evaluation  Measurement data of a real accident from an accident data recorder Reading out the data of an accident data recorder requires special software. The evaluation and interpretation of measurement data of a traffic accident require special knowledge in the areas of vehicle dynamics, accident reconstruction, metrology and last but not least the accident data storage technology itself. For UDS there is a separate order area for expert witnesses in Germany.https://svv.ihk.de/svv/content/home/home.ihk The picture on the right shows the (unprocessed) data curves of a real accident recorded with a UDS. The measured accelerations, the speed and various status channels are plotted over time. It can be seen, for example, that vehicle special signals were switched on prior to the collision and the driver was previously still applying the brake.  History  The nowadays known accident data recorder was invented by Mannesmann Kienzle GmbH, which applied for a patent in 1992. The development began in Germany in the early 1980s with the two companies MBB and Kienzle, who pursued different concepts. In general, the black box was taken as a model, which was developed in the early 1950s in Australia by David Warren. Already in 1973, General Motors applied for a patent for a \\"vehicle crash recorder\\". Mannesmann Kienzle delivered the first accident data recorder in early 1993.  Motorsport  In motorsport, accident data recorders (ADR) must be used in various series as specified by the FIA. Starting with the 2015 season, the use of an ADR in the Formula 4 championship was compulsory.http://www.globalinstitute.org/2016/02/29/accident-data- recorders/ In the higher series, the use has been mandatory for some time. In addition to the data of the acceleration sensors mounted on the vehicle, the loads on the driver are also measured with an in-ear accelerometer.https://www.fiafoundation.org/blog/2016/june/safety-measures Due to the higher speeds in formula sports compared to road traffic, the sensors have a measuring range of ± 150 g with a resolution of 0.1 g. 2 s are recorded before an event. With an event duration of 30 s, 10 events can be stored.https://www.motec.com.au/adr/adrfeatures/  Demarcation  Both in a flight recorder and in a UDS, the constantly recorded data runs in a ring buffer. However, the flight recorder usually records for longer periods of 17 to 25 hours. In contrast, the UDS only saves a few seconds before and after an event is triggered (e.g. collision) permanently. The term drive data recorder is generally understood to mean a continuous and permanently available recording of data and signals during the operation of a vehicle, independently of an accident. Such systems are often used in locomotives or trams. Often, however, an electronic logbook is referred to as drive data recorder. Dashcams are sometimes referred to as drive data recorder or video event data recorder (VEDR). A so-called Event Data Recorder (EDR) is not an accident data recorder in the sense of an autonomous, more or less vehicle-independent device, since an EDR is usually an additional electronic module in an existing control device (e.g. from the Airbag) in a car. EDRs rely exclusively on on-board signals, while UDS have their own inertial sensors. Vehicles with airbag systems store accident-relevant data (impact accelerations, belt buckle conditions, seat positions, trip times) in the internal memory of the tripping electronics. However, the data size varies depending on the manufacturer and only extends over a few seconds or fractions. NHTSA regulations call for uniform data sets for all systems manufactured from 2010 onwards.

He belonged to the Düsseldorf branch of the Nazarene movement.  Life and work  =Education and early career= His father was a servant of Count Adolf Friedrich Abraham von Gersdorf at Schloss Lodenau, who received a plot of land in nearby Neusorge as a reward for faithful service. The Count also sponsored and provided an education for Adolf, who became a student at the Moravian Pädagogium in Niesky, where his artistic talent was encouraged. Nevertheless, he was originally destined for an apprenticeship in a craft but, perhaps at the urging of the Count's family, was able to attend the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts. From 1818 to 1825, he studied with Ferdinand Hartmann and Johann Carl Rößler. After graduating, on the recommendation of the Academy's Director, Count Heinrich Carl Wilhelm Vitzthum von Eckstädt, he obtained a Royal Scholarship for the purpose of making a study trip to Italy.\\"Zimmermann bekam auf ein Jahr 100 Taler bewilligt, zusätzlich erhielt er Unterstützung durch einen wohlhabenden unbekannten Gönner\\". Source: Ludwig Richter: Lebenserinnerungen eines deutschen Malers. 1895, S. 244, In the Fall of 1825 (following a secret marriage), he and his friend Carl Gottlieb Peschel undertook the trip, making several stops along the way to visit with other artists. He remained there until 1829. Although he wrote to his wife that he was leaving Rome because he didn't have the financial means to remain or bring her there, it is believed that, being an Evangelical Protestant, he chose to leave due to religious disagreements with his fellow painters in the Nazarene movement, who felt that Catholicism provided a better basis for historical Bible painting.Geller, NLM 110, S. 186f. Adoration of the Shepherds, in the Friedenskirche of Essen-Steele (c. 1840) =Later career and decline= On his return, he settled in Pirna, where he taught drawing and painted portraits. His desire to paint historical and religious themes remained great however and, despite his belief that \\"the number of artists increases in the same proportion as the public's interest decreases\\", he decided to move back to Dresden in 1834.Geller, NLM 110, S. 193. While there, he met Wilhelm von Schadow, the Director of the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf. Schadow was a Romantic who wanted to encourage a return to naturalness in painting so, in 1835, Zimmermann became a teacher of \\"Divine Art\\" at the school. Once there, he became entangled in another dispute between Protestants and Catholics. In 1837, he and his wife Amalie (who he had married against the wishes of her family), decided to marry again, publicly, so she could live with him. Their life together was, unfortunately, short as lagging sales and continued religious squabbling created financial difficulties. In 1842, she took their two boys to live at her parents' home and gave birth to a daughter there. Lonely, and in poor health since his return from Rome, Zimmermann decided to leave Düsseldorf and establish himself someplace new. Amalie Zimmermann The art historian Karl Schnaase recommended Breslau, as the competition with other artists would not be great. Zimmermann wrote to his former pastor in Rome, Richard Rothe, who agreed with that choice and gave him a letter of recommendation to August Hahn, a University Professor. In 1846, Zimmermann retrieved his family and moved there, soon establishing a clientele that included Bishop Heinrich Förster. Most of his paintings during this period were portraits. Due to several bad harvests in the early 1850s, the members of the nobility became unwilling to pay as much for his works as they had previously. Having to pay his own way to and from the remote estates where they sat for their portraits, his profit fell rapidly. In 1855, he began a period of noticeable decline, as his eyesight deteriorated and he was weakened by a Cholera-like illness. Many of his friends rallied to provide support. His old patron Schnaase attempted to find him a teaching position or some form of permanent financial aid. His decline continued, however, and he died in 1859.Geller, NLM 110, S. 220.

Over the next century, the town became a significant port. In 1801, much of Alexandria was swept into the new District of Columbia; it was damaged along with much of the rest of the capital during the War of 1812. In 1846, Alexandria was returned to Virginia, along with the rest of the District's territory on the western side of the Potomac River. After Virginia seceded in 1861, Alexandria was swiftly captured by Union forces and held for the remainder of the American Civil War. In the late 20th century, Alexandria became a key part of the rapidly growing Northern Virginia region. Colonial era On October 21, 1669 a patent granted to Robert Howsing for transporting 120 people to the Colony of Virginia. That tract would later become the City of Alexandria. Virginia's comprehensive Tobacco Inspection Law of 1730 mandated that all tobacco grown in the colony must be brought to locally designated public warehouses for inspection before sale: one of the sites designated for a warehouse on the upper Potomac River was at the mouth of Hunting Creek. However, the ground being unsuitable at that location, the warehouse was established a half-mile up river, where the water ran deep near the shore. In 1745, the colony lost a 10-year dispute with Lord Fairfax over the western boundary of the Northern Neck Proprietary. After the Privy Council in London found in favor of Lord Fairfax's expanded claim, some of the Fairfax County gentry banded together to form the Ohio Company of Virginia. Their intent was to establish trade into the interior of America and for this they required an entrepot close to the head of navigation on the Potomac. The Hunting Creek tobacco warehouse offered the best location for a trading port which could accommodate sailing ships. However, many of the local tobacco planters wanted a new town to be sited up Hunting Creek, away from the \\"played out\\" tobacco fields along the river. Around 1746, Captain Philip Alexander II (1704–1753) moved to what is south of present Duke Street in Alexandria. His estate, which consisted of , was bounded by Hunting Creek, Hooff's Run, the Potomac River, and approximately the line which would become Cameron Street. At the opening of Virginia's 1748–49 legislative session, there was a petition submitted in the House of Burgesses on November 1, 1748, that the \\"inhabitants of Fairfax (Co.) praying that a town may be established at Hunting Creek Warehouse on Potowmack River,\\" as Hugh West was the owner of the warehouse. The petition was introduced by Lawrence Washington (1718-1752), the representative for Fairfax County and, more importantly, the son-in-law of William Fairfax and a founding member of the Ohio Company. To support the Company's push for a town on the river, Lawrence's younger brother George Washington, an aspiring surveyor, made a sketch of the shoreline touting the advantages of the tobacco warehouse site.Library of Congress: George Washington: Surveyor and Mapmaker: \\"Washington As Public Land Surveyor: Culpeper, the Frontier and Alexandria.\\" http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/gmdhtml/gwmaps.html Since the river site was amidst his estate, Philip opposed the idea and strongly favored a site at the head of Hunting Creek (also known as Great Hunting Creek). It has been said that in order to avoid a predicament the petitioners offered to name the new town Alexandria, in honor of Philip's family. As a result, Philip and his cousin Captain John Alexander (1711–1763) gave land to assist in the development of Alexandria, and are thus listed as the founders. This John was the son of Robert Alexander II (1688–1735). On May 2, 1749, the House of Burgesses approved the river location and ordered \\"Mr. Washington do go up with a Message to the Council and acquaint them that this House have agreed to the Amendments titled An Act for erecting a Town at Hunting Creek Warehouse, in the County of Fairfax.\\" A \\"Public Vendue\\" (auction) was advertised for July, and the county surveyor laid out street lanes and town lots. The auction was conducted on July 13–14, 1749. Almost immediately upon establishment, the town founders called the new town \\"Belhaven\\", believed to be in honor of a Scottish patriot, John Hamilton, 2nd Lord Belhaven and Stenton, the Northern Neck tobacco trade being then dominated by Scots. The name Belhaven was used in official lotteries to raise money for a Church and Market House, but it was never approved by the legislature and fell out of favor in the mid-1750s.The Scheme of a Lottery, at Belhaven, in Fairfax County: January 24, 1750/51; Virginia Gazette extracts; The William and Mary Quarterly, Vol.12 No.2 (October 1903) http://files.usgwarchives.net/va/richmondcity/newspapers/gazette5.txt The town of Alexandria did not become incorporated until 1779. In 1755, General Edward Braddock organized his fatal expedition against Fort Duquesne at Carlyle House in Alexandria. In April 1755, the governors of Virginia, and the Provinces of Maryland, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and New York met to determine upon concerted action against the French in America. In March 1785, commissioners from Virginia and Maryland met in Alexandria to discuss the commercial relations of the two states, finishing their business at Mount Vernon. The Mount Vernon Conference concluded on March 28 with an agreement for freedom of trade and freedom of navigation of the Potomac River. The Maryland legislature, in ratifying this agreement on November 22, proposed a conference among representatives from all the states to consider the adoption of definite commercial regulations. This led to the calling of the Annapolis Convention of 1786, which in turn led to the calling of the Federal Convention of 1787. District of Columbia William Charles mocked Alexandria citizens (kneeling at left, with hair standing on end) for not putting up more resistance to the British. In 1791, Alexandria was included in the area chosen by George Washington to become the District of Columbia. A portion of the City of Alexandria—known as \\"Old Town\\"--- and all of today's Arlington County share the distinction of having been originally in Virginia, ceded to the U.S. Government to form the District of Columbia, and later retroceded to Virginia by the federal government in 1846, when the District was reduced in size to exclude the portion south of the Potomac River. The City of Alexandria was re- chartered in 1852. In 1814, during the War of 1812, a British fleet launched a successful Raid on Alexandria, which surrendered without a fight. As agreed in the terms of surrender the British looted stores and warehouses of mainly flour, tobacco, cotton, wine, and sugar. From 1828 to 1836, Alexandria was home to the Franklin & Armfield Slave Market, one of the largest slave trading companies in the country. By the 1830s, they were sending more than 1,000 slaves annually from Alexandria to their Natchez, Mississippi, and New Orleans markets to help meet the demand for slaves in Mississippi and surrounding states. Later owned by Price, Birch & Co., the slave pen became a jail under Union occupation. Return to Virginia Slave ship taking on slaves at the Alexandria waterfront in 1836. Alexandria's slave trade made Virginia a more pro-slavery state after retrocession. Over time, a movement grew to separate Alexandria from the District of Columbia. As competition grew with the port of Georgetown and the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal fostered development on the north side of the Potomac River, the city's economy stagnated. In addition, many in Alexandria hoped to benefit from land sales and increased business from the federal government, which had no need for the land south of the river at the time. Also, its residents had lost representation and the right to vote at any level of government. Alexandria was also an important port and market in the slave trade, and there were increasing talk of the abolition of slavery in the national capital. Alexandria's economy would suffer greatly if slavery were outlawed. At the same time, there was an active abolition movement in Virginia, and the state's General Assembly was divided on the issue. Alexandria and Alexandria County would provide two new pro-slavery representatives. After a referendum, voters petitioned Congress and Virginia to return the area to Virginia. Congress retroceded the area to Virginia on July 9, 1846. Ultimately, the City of Alexandria became independent of Alexandria County in 1870. The remaining portion of Alexandria County changed its name to Arlington County in 1920. American Civil War A bird's eye view of Alexandria from the Potomac in 1863. Fort Ellsworth is visible on the hill in the center background. The first fatalities of the North and South in the American Civil War occurred in Alexandria. Within a month of the Battle of Fort Sumter, where two died, Union Army troops occupied Alexandria, landing troops at the base of King Street on the Potomac River on May 24, 1861. A few blocks up King Street from their landing site, the commander of the New York Fire Zouaves, Colonel Elmer E. Ellsworth, sortied with a small detachment to retrieve a large Confederate flag displayed on the roof of the Marshall House Inn that had been visible from the White House. While descending from the roof, Ellsworth was killed by James W. Jackson, the hotel proprietor. One of the soldiers in Ellsworth's party shot Jackson immediately thereafter.(1) (2) (3) Colonel Ellsworth was from Illinois and was a frequent visitor to the White House, where his death was much lamented. The incident generated excitement in both the Union and the Confederacy, where those loyal to each hailed Ellsworth or Jackson as a martyr to their respective cause. Map of Alexandria showing the forts that were constructed to defend Washington during the Civil War Alexandria remained under military occupation until the end of the Civil War. One of the ring of forts built during the war by the Union army for the defense of Washington, D.C., Fort Ward, is located within the boundaries of modern Alexandria. Fort Ward Museum, City of Alexandria After the establishment of the state of West Virginia in 1863 and until the close of the war, Alexandria was the seat of the Restored Government of Virginia also known as the \\"Alexandria Government.\\" During the Union occupation, a recurring point of contention between the Alexandria citizenry and the military occupiers was the military's periodic insistence that church services include prayers for the President of the United States. Because the Episcopal Church used a written prayer book service that made distinct mention of both the executive and the legislative departments of the government, Episcopal clergy were exposed to particular embarrassment whenever any part of the territory of the Confederate States was occupied by Union forces. Cheshire, Joseph Blount, The Church in the Confederate States, New York, NY: 1912 ch. 6. Alexandria's St. Paul's Episcopal Church was the site of an early and particularly notorious incident. The interim minister at St. Paul's Church, the Rev. Dr. K. J. Stewart, was arrested in the sanctuary on February 9, 1862, by Union troops who had attended with the stated purpose of provoking an incident.Kaye, Ruth Lincoln, History of St. Paul's Episcopal Church, Alexandria, Virginia, Springfield, Va.: Goetz Printing Co, 1984 pp. 47, 53–54;Cheshire 1912 ch. 6 During the Litany, Dr. Stewart was ordered by an attending Union officer to say the Prayer for the President of the United States that Dr. Stewart had omitted without saying any other prayer in its place. Dr. Stewart proceeded without paying any attention to the interruption; but a captain and six of his soldiers, who were present in the congregation with intent to provoke an incident, drew their swords and pistols, strode into the chancel, seized the clergyman while he was still kneeling, held pistols to his head, and forced him out of the church, and through the streets, just as he was, in his surplice and stole, and committed him to the guard-house of the 8th Illinois Cavalry. Dr. Stewart was soon released, but was not allowed to continue to officiate at services.Cheshire 1912 ch. 6; Kaye 1984 pp. 46–52. The day after the Alexandria Gazette reported the incident in detail, its offices were set afire.Kaye 1984 p. 52–53. The St. Paul's sanctuary was thereafter closed for the duration of the war and its vestry records also were destroyed by a fire. For the duration of the war, the St. Paul's sanctuary was used by the Union army as a hospital for the wounded.Kaye 1984 p. 52. Buildings at Virginia Theological Seminary and at Episcopal High School also served as hospitals for union troops. Bullets, belt clips, and other artifacts from the Civil War have been found in those areas well into the 20th century. Christ Church, because of its association with George Washington, was not closed, but came under the control of army chaplains for the duration of the war.Dashiell, Thomas Grayson, A Digest of the Proceedings of the Conventions and Councils in the Diocese of Virginia, Richmond, Va.: William E. Jones 1883, pp. 289–90. For African American escaped slaves, the military occupation of Alexandria created opportunity on an unprecedented scale. As Federal troops extended their occupation of the seceded states, escaped slaves flooded into Union-controlled areas. Safely behind Union lines, the cities of Alexandria and Washington offered not only comparative freedom, but employment. Over the course of the war, Alexandria was transformed by the Union occupiers into a major supply depot and transport and hospital center, all under army control. Map of Alexandria County (1878), including what is now Arlington County and the City of Alexandria. Map includes the names of property owners at that time. City boundaries roughly correspond with Old Town. U.S. Geological Survey Map of the \\"Alexandria Quadrangle\\" (1945), including what is now the City of Alexandria and surrounding areas. At this time, the City of Alexandria was bounded on the west by Seminary and Quaker Roads, on the north by Four Mile Run and on the south by Little River Turnpike/Duke Street and Hunting Creek. Because the escaped slaves were still legally property until the abolition of slavery, they were labeled as contrabands to prevent their being returned to their masters. Contrabands took positions with the army as construction workers, nurses and hospital stewards, longshoremen, painters, wood cutters, teamsters, laundresses, cooks, gravediggers, personal servants, and ultimately as soldiers and sailors. According to one statistic, the population of Alexandria had exploded to 18,000 by the fall of 1863 – an increase of 10,000 people in 16 months. As of ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment, Alexandria County's black population was more than 8,700, or about half the total number of residents in the County. This newly enfranchised constituency provided the support necessary to elect the first black Alexandrians to the City Council and the Virginia Legislature.Freed People and Freedmen's Cemetery – Alexandria, Virginia. The population of contrabands flooding into Alexandria during the Union occupation included many who were destitute, malnourished and in poor health. Once in Alexandria, the contrabands were housed in barracks and hastily assembled shantytowns. In the close quarters with poor sanitation, smallpox and typhoid outbreaks were prevalent and death was common. In February 1864, after hundreds of contrabands and freedmen had perished, the commander of the Alexandria military district, General John P. Slough, seized a parcel of undeveloped land at the corner of South Washington and Church Streets from a pro-Confederate owner to be used as a cemetery specifically for burial of contrabands. Burials started in March that year. The cemetery operated under General Slough's command. Its oversight was supervised by Alexandria's Superintendent of Contrabands, the Rev. Albert Gladwin, who made arrangements for burials. Each grave was identified with a whitewashed, wooden grave marker. In 1868, after Congress ended most functions of the Freedmen's Bureau, the cemetery was closed; and the property was returned to its original owners. Eventually, after the grave markers had rotted and ownership had transferred several times, the property was redeveloped for commercial use. During its five years of operation, about 1800 contrabands and freedmen were buried in the cemetery. Beginning in 1987, when memory of the cemetery was revived, the City of Alexandria began the process of saving the cemetery to create a memorial park. During 2008, submissions in a design competition for the memorial were received from 20 countries, and a design for the memorial was selected. As of late 2008, construction of the memorial was underway. Design Competition Winners. As Contrabands and Freedmen Cemetery, the cemetery was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in August, 2012. 20th century Child laborers working at a glass factory in Alexandria, 1911. Photo by Lewis Hine. At the turn of the 20th century, the most common production in the city was glass, fertilizer, beer and leather. The glass often went into beer bottles. Much of the Virginia Glass Company effort went to supply the demands of the Robert Portner Brewing Company, until fire destroyed the St. Asaph Street plant on February 18, 1905. The Old Dominion Glass Company also had a glass works fall to fire, then built a new one. The Belle Pre Bottle Company held a monopoly on a milk bottle that they patented, yet that organization only lasted 10 years.Commerce: Most businesses were smaller where the business occupied the first floor of a building and the owner and family lived above.

In 1955, then-congressman and future president Gerald R. Ford and his family moved to Alexandria from Georgetown. The Fords remained in their Alexandria home during Ford's tenure as vice president of the United States (1973–1974), as the vice president did not yet have an official residence. Following the resignation of Richard Nixon, Ford spent his first 10 days as President in the house before moving to the White House. In March 1959, Lieutenant Colonel William Henry Whalen, the \\"highest-ranking American ever recruited as a mole by the Russian Intelligence Service,\\" provided Colonel Sergei A.

History of classification The subfamily Nodosaurinae was originally named by Othenio Abel in 1919. It originally included Ankylosaurus, from the Upper Cretaceous of North America, possibly Hierosaurus, and Stegopelta, from North America also. It was found to be very specialized and peculiar by Abel. Abel mentioned that the neck shield found in ceratopsians was very different from all nodosaurines, and that only the neck spines are present in Nodosaurinae. The body of nodosaurines is completely covered in strong armour plates, with a similar shape to tiles, and are lined up along the body. A large degree of pubic reduction was found in nodosaurines, a feature that is also found in Stegosaurus and Triceratops. Nodosaurines were all quadrupedal, and lived that way for their whole life. Quadrupedalism was found to be a feature in Stegosauridae, and Ceratopsidae. It was unused for a long time, but in 2013 during the description of a new basal nodosaurid, Europelta, and the redefinition of Struthiosaurinae, James Kirkland and his colleagues found all North American nodosaurids to represent the derived group Nodosaurinae, while all European nodosaurids made up the basal clade Struthiosaurinae. Biogeography The near simultaneous appearance of nodosaurids in both North America and Europe is worthy of consideration, because at the time, they were separated from each other by a huge body of water. Europelta is the oldest nodosaurid from Europe; it is derived from the lower Albian Escucha Formation. The oldest western North American nodosaurid is Sauropelta, from the lower Albian Little Sheep Mudstone Member of the Cloverly Formation, at an age of 108.5±0.2 million years. Eastern North American fossils seem older. Teeth of Priconodon crassus have been derived from the Arundel Clay of the Potomac Group of Maryland, which dates near the Aptian–Albian boundary. A Propanoplosaurus hatchling was uncovered from the base of the underlying Patuxent Formation, dated to the upper Aptian, making Propanoplosaurus the oldest nodosaurid. Polacanthids are known from pre-Aptian fauna from both Europe and North America. The timing of the appearance of nodosaurids on both continents indicates the origins of the clade preceded the isolation of North America and Europe, thereby pushing the group's date of evolution back to at least the middle Aptian. The separation of Nodosauridae into European Struthiosaurinae and North American Nodosaurinae by the end of the Aptian provides a revised date for the isolation of the continents from each other with rising sealevel.

In addition to increased heat and other extreme weather conditions and drought conditions in some parts of the country, the melting of glaciers in the Himalayas, threatens the volumetric flow rate of many of the most important rivers of Pakistan. As a result of ongoing climate change, the climate of Pakistan has become increasingly volatile over the past several decades; this trend is expected to continue. Pakistan makes a tiny contribution to total global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, less than 1% (among the lowest in the world) but it is among the countries most vulnerable to climate change, and it has very low technical and financial capacity to adapt to its adverse impacts. Food and water security, as well as large displacement of populations are already being threatened. Members of the public expect to have widespread impacts on their lives.  Emissions and emissions mitigation  Climate Change Mitigation Pakistan's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are low compared to international standards. In 2008 Pakistan's total GHG emissions were 310 million tons of CO2 equivalent. These comprised: CO2 54%; Methane (CH4) 36%; Nitrous Oxide (N2O) 9%; Carbon Monoxide (CO) 0.7%; and Non-Methane volatile organic compounds 0.3%. (Source: National GHG inventory 2008). The energy sector is the single largest source of GHG emission in Pakistan; it accounts for nearly 51% of these emissions and is followed by the agriculture sector (39%), industrial processes (6%), land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) (3%) emissions and waste (1%) (Source: National GHG inventory 2008). As such, the most important targets for mitigation efforts focused on reduction of GHG emissions are the energy and agriculture sectors. In the energy sector, integration of climate change and energy policy objectives is particularly important as today's investment will “lock in” the infrastructure, fuel and technologies to be used for decades to come. Similarly, the building and transport infrastructure put in place today should meet the design needs of the future. Therefore, greater attention must be paid to energy efficiency requirements in building codes and long-term transport planning. According to research led by Dr. Adil Najam at the Lahore University of Management Sciences, by 2040 the cost of climate change to agriculture in Pakistan is likely to be up to 7% of productivity but that good climate adaptation practices could result in a net productivity gain of up to 40+%. Effects The important climate change threats to Pakistan are: * Considerable increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. * Increased siltation of major dams caused by more frequent and intense floods; * Rising temperatures resulting in enhanced heat and water- stressed conditions, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions, leading to reduced agricultural productivity; * Further decrease in the already scanty forest cover, from too rapid change in climatic conditions to allow natural migration of adversely affected plant species; * Increased intrusion of saline water in the Indus delta, adversely affecting coastal agriculture, mangroves and the breeding grounds of fish; * Threat to coastal areas due to projected sea level rise and increased cyclonic activity due to higher sea surface temperatures; * Increased stress between upper riparian and lower riparian regions in relation to sharing of water resources; * Increased health risks and climate change induced migration. = Extreme weather = Government projections, highlight considerable increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, coupled with erratic monsoon rains causing frequent and intense floods and droughts. For example, between 1998-2018 Pakistan reported more than 150 extreme weather events. = Sea intrusion and erosion = Indus River Delta cities and islands have increasingly been eroded due to rising sea level. One government official described 3 million acres of land being lost because of this. This change has displaced over 1 million people.  Migration  Due to extreme weather and uncertain economic outcomes, rural communities in Pakistan have been displaced in large numbers to major cities. Experts expect 20% of the population to move to major cities; current migration patterns included 700,000 people a year moving from rural to urban environments. Larger estimates, including major displacements because of extreme weather, suggest as many as 20 million migrants from rural to urban communities since 2010. Government action  Various programs focused on adaptation and mitigation have been developed within the Pakistani government. Since 2017, a cabinet-level ministry has led much of that capacity. = Ministry of Climate Change = = Reforestation = Pakistan only has less than 6% forest area. This, combined with the climate changes, exacerbates challenges such as flooding, heat waves, and soil loss. Starting in 2014, the government started pursuing a Billion Tree Tsunami policy, and in 2018 that policy was extend to a 10 billion tree Plant for Pakistan program. During the COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan, government agencies continued their reforestation program planning to plant and creating 60,000 jobs among the unemployed.  Public opinion  According to the BBC Climate Asia report, the majority of the Pakistani people surveyed claimed that climate change has heavily impacted their lives in the form of floods and droughts, and most importantly has affected the availability of resources such as energy and water. 53% of Pakistanis felt that their lives had become worse off than they were five years ago. Although the effects of climate change are evident, the survey found that the majority of the people were unaware of the meaning of climate change, and \\"ascribed changes in climate and extreme weather events to the will of God.\\" References External links * A 5000-yr Record of Climate Change in Varved Sediments from the Oxygen Minimum Zone off Pakistan, Northeastern Arabian Sea * Climate change in the Northwest Frontier Province of Pakistan * Impact of climate change in Pakistan * Pakistan worst affected by climate change * Climate change in Pakistan: innovation in the absence of government support * \\"Global Warming impacts & Effects on The Climate of pakistan\\" PakWeather.com February 28, 2015 .C C Pakistan Category:Weather events in Pakistan ","title":"Climate change in Pakistan"},{"id":"42188321","text":"Myrmecia pulchra is an Australian bull ant species, a part of the genus Myrmecia.

Pink: other areas in the present combined quarter  Korkut Effendi Quarter - landmarks  In this division the numerous traces of houses of a superior description such as the much mutilated doors and windows of lower floors and courses of regular masonry, seem to suggest the existence of a Latin parish. = Turunjlu Jami = The mosque of the district is known as the Turunjlu (Turunçlu) Jami or mosque of the \\"orange tree.\\" It appears to be a building of 18th century style, in the general form of a church with a narthex or porch at the west end. In all probability it is built on the foundations of a mediaeval Latin church, but neither date nor inscription remains to afford any information on the subject.  Iplik Pazar Quarter - landmarks  Iplik Pazar means cotton or linen market. This quarter probably represents a Latin parish of which the church has been appropriated as a mosque. = Iplik Pazar Mosque = The minaret of Iplik Pazar mosque, with its distinctive stone top, rising above the Iplik Pazar Quarter This is a small 19th century building of the usual simple utilitarian character, which was restored in 1826 and 1899. Attached to it is a singularly short minaret the gallery of which is not higher than the first floor of surrounding buildings. The minaret is older than the main building and is probably the only minaret in Cyprus with a stone conical cap. An older building may have existed on the site, of which the minaret remains, half buried in the mound of earth and debris which has accumulated in this neighbourhood from the decay and ruin of old houses. = Mosque of the Serai = The present Mosque of the Serai is a small building erected in 1903, occupying the site of an older mosque built between 1820 and 1824. It may have been constructed out of the remains of a church. A few gravestones which existed in this former building point to this fact. On one of these gravestones was a fairly complete inscription. The other fragments were too much broken to be decipherable. They have all since been destroyed. =Venetian Column = In the north-west corner of the quarter lies the Atatürk Square, commonly known as \\"Sarayönü\\", square of the former Serai or palace, in the centre of which stands the symbol of Venetian Dominion still preserved : the column which was always set up in the principal piazza of a Venetian town. The column in Nicosia is a particularly interesting example of such a monument on account of the inscription and coats of arms on its base. The shaft of grey granite which measures about 6 metres in height and about 70 cm in diameter is evidently the relic of some important Roman temple. Six coats of arms carved in marble in an early renaissance style originally decorated the six faces of the pedestal. The column was intended to be crowned with a Lion of St. Mark which has disappeared. Until the late 19th century a pole stood close by which probably occupied the same place as the original Venetian flagstaff. This pole was decorated with Turkish flags on festival occasions, much in the same way as in the days when the lion banner of St. Mark floated from it, and proclaimed the sovereignty of the \\"Serene Republic\\" in this principal piazza of the capital. The Nicosia column was erected in about the year 1550. It was restored on a new site in the summer of 1915, at a few yards distance from its original emplacement. = Büyük Hamam = The Büyük Hamam (large bathhouse) stands nearby Iplik Pazar mosque. Although some have suggested that this building is the 14th century church of St. George the Latins, no evidence is forthcoming for such an identification, and this theory overlooks the fact that although the building much resembles a mediaeval church in appearance it does not conform to the invariable planning of such buildings. Instead of lying east and west it is built north and south in a manner which would have been almost impossible until perhaps the period of the Venetian Occupation. The interior is a vaulted hall of three bays. This doorway constructed of mutilated fragments from another building which have been pieced together in a clumsy manner, is remarkable as having been originally an exact replica of the west portal of the church of Akhiropietos Monastery in Kyrenia District). In consequence of the decay of surrounding buildings this Bath House is buried to a depth of about one metre and a half below the present level of the neighbouring roads and lanes.

In contrast, a monetary dove is someone who emphasizes other issues, especially low unemployment, over low inflation. The two terms are commonly used in the United States to describe members and nominees to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, who have major influence on United States monetary policy in their roles as Federal Reserve Governors and as members of the Federal Open Market Committee. The terms are also used outside of the United States, in places such as the United Kingdom and India. The term \\"pigeon\\" has been used to describe individuals who take positions between those of hawks and doves, although the term \\"centrist\\" is also used. Doves generally are more in favor of expansionary monetary policy, including low interest rates, while hawks tend to favor \\"tight\\" monetary policy. For example, doves in the United States tend to favor quantitative easing, seeing it as a way to stimulate the economy, while hawks tend to oppose quantitative easing, seeing it as a distortion of asset markets. Additionally, hawks tend to project higher future inflation, and hence see more risk from inflation and a greater need for tight monetary policies, while doves tend to predict lower future inflation, and hence see more need for expansionary monetary policies. An individual can be a hawk in some cases and a dove in others. For example, Janet Yellen was described as a hawk during the economic boom of the 1990s, but was usually described as a dove when she was nominated to the position of Chair of the Federal Reserve. Additionally, the label of \\"hawk\\" and \\"dove\\" may be applied differently depending on the point of view. The hawk–dove dichotomy has been criticized as overly simplistic, especially in times of deflation or low inflation. For example, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard has been described as a \\"deflation hawk\\" for favoring policies that would raise inflation to a target of 2 percent per year. Washington Post columnist Neil Irwin used the term \\"bubble hawk\\" to describe those who focus on using monetary policy to fight financial bubbles.

Retrieved September 6, 2010, from VUHoops: http://vuhoops.com/2010/04/27/jayvaughn-pinkston-named-ny-poy/ The Daily News reported that multiple sources expected JayVaughn to sign a letter to attend the University of Tennessee over Villanova and St. John's, but sources with knowledge of Pinkston's thinking say he reconsidered his decision, discussed it with his family and decided to hold off until the late signing date. Before graduating, Pinkston made his announcement April 14, 2010 to continue his education at Villanova University. Coach Jay Wright was excited to for JayVaughn to be entering his school by saying, \\"JayVaughn is an incredibly talented young man who has a unique passion for the game. He has been well- coached by Edwin Gonzalez and Kimani Young. He can play multiple positions and has been a leader at Bishop Loughlin for four years. We are thrilled to welcome JayVaughn and his mom, Kerry, into the Villanova Family.\\" College career =Redshirt= On November 7, 2010, Pinkston got into a fight at the Sigma Phi Epsilon house after a fraternity brother locked him in a laundry room. The Upper Merion Township police arrested and charged Pinkston with two counts of assault and harassment. Villanova University allowed him to finish his coursework for the first semester, but he was banned for the second semester. He could not use practice facilities and had to watch his team play from the bleachers. \\"That's the first time anything like that had happened to me,\\" he said. \\"And that's a big one for an 18-year-old kid. I saw my life, everything I had worked for, flash before my eyes. I thought I was done.\\" Jay Wright thought Pinkston was going to transfer, and offered his support if he decided to. Pinkston instead decided to stay with the team, which greatly surprised Wright. Pinkston found lodging with Matt and Christy O'Reilly, whose children went to school with Wright's children. Per NCAA policy, Pinkston had to pay the going rate for renting an apartment in the area. He found work stacking boxes in a nearby warehouse, and the O'Reillys became like a second family to him. =Freshman= Pinkston made his collegiate debut with nine points and four rebounds in a blowout win against Monmouth. He averaged 9.6 points and 5.2 rebounds per game in his redshirt freshman season. He scored 12.6 points in Big East conference games and shot 103 free throws in conference, which was a team high.

Pinkston was rushed to the hospital, where he was diagnosed with MRSA and had emergency surgery. The disease did not spread to his bloodstream and he was released in less than a week. Teammate Ryan Arcidiacono thought the major health scare changed Pinkston's outlook on life, making him a more humble person. Pinkston was named to the preseason second team All-Big East. He notched a season-high 27 points to go along with eight rebounds in a 98-68 win at St. Joseph's on December 7.

Built in 1804, it is one of the area's most prominent examples of Federal period architecture, albeit with substantial early 20th-century Colonial Revival alterations. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. It is now owned by the Nashua Historical Society, which operates it as a museum; it is open by appointment. Description and history Abbot Square is a triangular green just north of downtown Nashua, bounded by Amherst Street, Concord Street, and Nashville Street. The Abbot House stands on the north side of Nashville Street, facing south. It is a two-story wood frame house with brick side walls, a locally rare feature. It is covered by a truncated hip roof, with a low balustrade around the outer edge. The front facade is five bays wide, with windows symmetrically placed around a slightly wider central bay. The main entrance is in the center, sheltered by a rectangular portico supported by four large fluted columns and topped by a balustrade. The house was built in 1804 for Daniel Abbot, a prominent local resident. It was owned 1854-1892 by George Perham, under whose ownership the exterior was given an extensive Victorian treatment, which included a three-story tower in the central bay. Purchased in 1905 by William Spaulding, he removed most of the Victorian alterations, while adding Colonial Revival features, including the present portico. The house was given to the Nashua Historical Society by his descendants.

The site opened in 2006 and is operated by the British Army and incorporates both Rock Barracks and Woodbridge Airfield. The barracks are home to two Royal Engineers Regiments. The airfield is used periodically by helicopters of the Army Air Corps for training exercises. The site was previously known as RAF Woodbridge and had periods where it was operated by the Royal Air Force and United States Air Force. The RAF station closed in August 1993.  History  = RAF Woodbridge = Constructed in 1943 as a Royal Air Force (RAF) airfield during the Second World War to assist damaged aircraft to land on their return from raids over Germany, it was later used by the United States Air Force during the Cold War, being the primary home for the 79th Tactical Fighter Squadron and the 78th Tactical Fighter Squadron and squadrons of the 81st Fighter Wing under various designations until 1993. For many years, the 81st Fighter Wing also operated from nearby RAF Bentwaters, with Bentwaters and Woodbridge being known as the \\"Twin Bases\\". The RAF station closed in August 1993. = Reactivation = In 2001, the Ministry of Defence announced that £100 million would be invested in the Woodbridge site in order to accommodate British Army personnel. Due to budgetary constraints and commitments to Operation Telic (the UK's contribution to the Iraq War), the start of work at Woodbridge was delayed until January 2004. On 1 September 2006, the former Woodbridge site was split up and the two parts renamed as Woodbridge Airfield and Rock Barracks.

The statue is tall, and depicts a naked young woman or girl with stylized proportions standing in a confident, naturalistic pose. Dancing Girl is well-regarded as a work of art, and is a cultural artefact of the Indus Valley Civilisation. The statuette was discovered by British archaeologist Ernest Mackay in the \\"HR area\\" of Mohenjo- daro in 1926. It is held by the National Museum, New Delhi, and the ownership of the statue is disputed by Pakistan. Description This is one of 2 bronze art works found at Mohenjo-daro that show more flexible features when compared to other more formal poses. The girl is naked, wears a number of bangles and a necklace and is shown in a natural standing position with one hand on her hip. She wears 24 to 25 bangles on her left arm and 4 bangles on her right arm, and some object was held in her left hand, which is resting on her thigh; both arms are unusually long. Her necklace has three big pendants. She has her long hair styled in a big bun that is resting on her shoulder. Expert opinions Karachi Museum, Pakistan. In 1973, British archaeologist Mortimer Wheeler described the item as his favourite statuette: > \\"She's about fifteen years old I should think, not more, but she stands > there with bangles all the way up her arm and nothing else on. A girl > perfectly, for the moment, perfectly confident of herself and the world. > There's nothing like her, I think, in the world.\\" John Marshall, the archeologist at Mohenjo-daro who found the figure, described the figure as \\"a young girl, her hand on her hip in a half-impudent posture, and legs slightly forward as she beats time to the music with her legs and feet\\". He is known to reacted with surprise when he saw this statuette. He said \\"When I first saw them I found it difficult to believe that they were prehistoric.\\" The archaeologist Gregory Possehl described Dancing Girl as \\"the most captivating piece of art from an Indus site\\" and qualified the description of her as a dancer by stating that, \\"We may not be certain that she was a dancer, but she was good at what she did and she knew it.\\" The statue led to two important discoveries about the civilization: first that they knew metal blending, casting and other sophisticated methods, and secondly that entertainment, especially dance was part of the culture. The bronze girl was made using the lost-wax casting technique and shows the expertise of the people in making bronze works during that time. The statue is displayed at National Museum, New Delhi. A similar bronze statuette was found by Mackay during his final full season of 1930–31 at DK-G area in a house at Mohenjo-daro. The preservation, as well as quality of craftsmanship, is inferior to that of the well known Dancing Girl. This second bronze female figure is displayed at Karachi Museum, Pakistan. An engraving on a piece of red potsherd, discovered at Bhirrana, India, a Harappan site in Fatehabad district in Haryana, shows an image that is evocative of Dancing Girl. The excavation team leader, L. S. Rao, Superintending Archaeologist, Excavation Branch, ASI, remarked that, “... the delineation [of the lines in the potsherd] is so true to the stance, including the disposition of the hands, of the bronze that it appears that the craftsman of Bhirrana had first-hand knowledge of the former”. Ownership dispute Some Pakistani politicians and experts have demanded that the Dancing Girl be \\"returned\\" to Pakistan. In 2016 Pakistani barrister, Javed Iqbal Jaffery, petitioned the Lahore High Court for the return of the statue, claiming that it had been \\"taken from Pakistan 60 years ago on the request of the National Arts Council in Delhi but never returned.\\" According to him, the Dancing Girl was to Pakistan what Da Vinci's Mona Lisa was to Europe. Another version of events, however, \\"suggests the statue was taken to Delhi before Partition by Mortimer Wheeler\\". References General references *Craddock PT. 2015.

She specializes in linguistic anthropology and received a Ph.D. in anthropology from the University of California at Berkeley. Woolard served as the president of the Society for Linguistic Anthropology, a section of the American Anthropological Association, from 2009 to 2011.  Research and publications  = Research interests = Woolard is interested in linguistic anthropology, language and ethnicity, bilingualism, language ideology, and political discourse in Catalonia, Spain, and the United States. = Research overview = Woolard studies social relations and language use from an anthropological perspective, viewing language as a tool for communication, a means of social action, and a way of understanding the world. From this point of view, Woolard's analyses can be framed within current critical sociolinguistics, as her work integrates sociolinguistic theory and social theory. Within this perspective, the ideas that individuals and groups have about language and linguistic practices are understood as expressions of different views of society and social organization. Other scholars associated with critical sociolinguistics include Pierre Bourdieu and Mikhail Bakhtin. Based on ethnographic investigation, Woolard analyzes the place of authority and authenticity in people's understanding of language and social order, particularly as these concepts are understood in Catalonia related to changes in the national language project and the status of Catalan and Castilian in contemporary Catalonia after thirty years of political autonomy within Spain. In relation to the media coverage of Catalonia, Woolard explains how there is a tendency for coverage to point to Catalonia's distinct language and culture, to demonstrate backwardness in the country. Woolard's research looks at how the media does not capture the linguistic dynamics of Catalan identity or the sovereignty movement adequately, which she addresses in her book, Singular and Plural: Ideologies of Linguistic Authority in 21st Century Catalonia which was written in 2016. = Singular and Plural: Ideologies of Linguistic Authority in 21st Century Catalonia = In Singular and Plural: Ideologies of Linguistic Authority in Twenty-First Century Catanolia, Woolard analyzes linguistic authority and then applies this analysis to Catalonia's political situation. Through a range of case studies, Woolard demonstrates the changes in Catalan linguistic practices, identities, and ideology. With Catalonia's autonomy within Spain, identities linked to Catalonia and the Catalan language have been questioned and shifted in the last decades. Woolard calls for linguistic anthropologists to recognize the polarization of language ideology, nationalism, and cosmopolitanism in relation to Catalonian politics. Woolard provides a framework to be used on the analysis of linguistic authorities and applies it to the politics of language in Catalonia. She then analyzes how this general framework could be used in analyzing language ideologies in other contexts. Woolard investigates the intersections between language and politics by building on her research relating to how language acquires authority in the public eye. She demonstrates that ideologies of authenticity and anonymity pare underpinned by sociolinguistic naturalism. She argues that Catalan speakers are shifting towards innovative linguistic practices that differ from the naturalistic ideologies. Woolard also looks at the coverage from the United States on Catalonia and the media's 'imbalanced' portrayal. Woolard then looks at how the media's coverage of language and politics is limited by what she calls \\"mainstream and unionist Spanish media.\\" Woolard's book won the Society for Linguistic Anthropology Edward Sapir Book Prize in 2017. =Selected publications= *1989.

When the accent also changes its syllable, the process is called metataxis. Metataxis can also be analyzed as a combination of accent movement and metatony. The term is usually used when referring to accentual developments in the history of Baltic and Slavic languages which exhibited numerous such developments, representing the accentual equivalent of sound change. Slavic metatony In South Slavic languages (Serbo-Croatian and Slovene) Proto-Slavic old acute accent ⟨ő⟩ was shortened. Its direct reflex is the short falling accent ⟨ȍ⟩ in standard Serbo-Croatian, whereas standard Slovene has long rising accent ⟨ó⟩ with younger length.This is due to secondary lengthening of all non-final syllables. This lengthening, however, has not occurred in all Slovene dialects. * Common Slavic *bra̋trъ \\"brother\\" > Serbo-Croatian brȁt/бра̏т, Slovene bràt In all Serbo-Croatian and Slovene dialects, in nominative singular of o- and i-stems the stem-final syllable of accent paradigm c words is lengthened. For monsyllabics this amounts to lengthening of short circumflex accent ⟨ȍ⟩ to long circumflex ⟨ȏ⟩: * Common Slavic *bȍgъ \\"god\\" > Serbo-Croatian bȏg/бо̑г, Slovene bóg Slavic metataxis During the Proto- Slavic period the so-called neoacute accent was created by accent retraction owing to the reduction and ultimately loss of weak yers. There were two forms - ⟨ò⟩ the short neoacute, and ⟨õ⟩ the long neoacute. Short and long neoacute are traditionally marked with two different symbols, even though we're dealing with the same prosodeme on short and long vowels, respectively. Neoacute is traditionally reconstructed as a rising intonation on the basis of Slovene and Russian, and the description of dialectal Serbo-Croatian (Chakavian) ⟨õ⟩ as a rising tone. Short neoacute has a distinct reflex in Slovak and some Russian dialects. Baltic metatony In Aukštaitian Lithuanian dialects a metatony occurred as a reflex of Balto-Slavic acute accent which is generally assumed to be a rising tone, and which was changed to a falling tone in Lithuanian. The new accent is also marked with an acute accent mark, but its nature has changed from rising to falling. This change, usually called Lithuanian metatony, is absent in Žemaitian dialects of Lithuanian where Balto-Slavic accented acute is reflected as a broken tone.

He was also a noted writer of military biography, history, and theory. Biography =Early life and career= Callwell was born in London, the only son of Henry Callwell, of Lismoyne, Ballycastle, County Antrim, by his wife, Maud Martin, of Ross, Connemara. He was educated by a German governess, and then at Haileybury, before entering the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, in 1876. He was commissioned as a lieutenant in January 1878, joining a battery of the 3rd Brigade, Royal Field Artillery, then stationed in India, and serving in the closing stages of the Second Anglo-Afghan War. In January 1881 his battery was transferred to Natal, arriving just in time to take part in the final operations of the ill-fated expedition against the Transvaal Boers. Shortly afterwards Callwell returned to Woolwich; then in late 1884 he passed the entrance examination to the Staff College, where he was a student from February 1885 into 1886. He was promoted to captain on 17 March 1886. =Small Wars= In 1886 Callwell was awarded the Trench Gascoigne Prize Essay Competition gold medal by the Royal United Service Institution for his essay Lessons to be learned from the campaigns in which British Forces have been employed since the year 1865. This was later expanded into a book Small Wars, published in 1896, which was adopted as an official British Army textbook, and won wide recognition. It was revised and republished in 1899 and 1906, was translated in French, and was eagerly read by members of the Irish Republican Army during the Irish War of Independence. The United States Marine Corps Small Wars Manual, originally published in 1935, drew heavily on Callwell's book, and as the first comprehensive study of what came to be known as \\"asymmetric warfare\\", it gained renewed popularity in the 1990s, and remains in print. Douglas Porch, in his preface to the 1996 edition called Callwell \\"the Clausewitz of colonial warfare\\". =Intelligence and Staff officer= On 1 October 1887 Callwell was seconded for service as a Staff Captain in the Intelligence Branch at Army Headquarters. On 13 July 1891 he was appointed Deputy Assistant Adjutant-General, serving until September 1892, when he returned to the Royal Artillery as a captain. Callwell was seconded for service on the General Staff on 9 September 1893, and was later was appointed a brigade major in the Western District of the Royal Artillery, serving until September 1896, having received promotion to the rank of major on 25 March 1896. On the outbreak of the Greco-Turkish War in April 1897, Callwell was attached to the Greek army and spent a year in the Near East. In October 1899, when war was declared against the Boer Republics in South Africa, Callwell was appointed to the staff of Sir Redvers Buller, and was present throughout the operations which ended with the relief of Ladysmith on 28 February 1900. In September 1901 he received a mention in despatches from Earl Roberts, and was awarded the brevet rank of lieutenant-colonel (dated to 29 November 1900), and given command of a mobile column, with which he served in the Western Transvaal and in Cape Colony until the close of the war in June 1902. He left Cape Town for England the following month, and arrived in Southampton in August 1902. A year after his return to England, he was appointed a Deputy Assistant Quartermaster-General in the mobilization branch of the War Office on 6 October 1903, and by April 1904 was working in Intelligence once again. On 1 October 1904 he was appointed an Assistant Director of Military Operations, with the substantive rank of Colonel. In June 1907 Callwell was made a Companion of the Bath, at which time he was General Staff Officer, 1st Grade, at Army Headquarters. In October 1907 his appointment to the Staff came to an end and he was placed on half-pay. Having seen several of his contemporaries promoted to general officer rank over his head, Callwell eventually quit the army in June 1909, to devote himself to writing. =First World War= On the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, Callwell was recalled to active service, being appointed Director of Military Operations at the War Office with the temporary rank of major-general. He carried out much important work successfully, not least the preparation of various plans for the organization of the Dardanelles campaign, an operation which he personally opposed. In December 1915, following on the appointment of Sir William Robertson as Chief of the Imperial General Staff, a reorganization took place at the War Office. Operations and intelligence were divided into two independent branches, with Callwell as Director of Military Intelligence from 23 December until 3 January 1916, when George Macdonogh took over.Jeffery (2010) p. 49. Callwell was then sent on a special mission to Russia in connexion with the supply of munitions to that country and with the general question of Russian co-operation in the War. In April 1916 Callwell was made a Commandeur of the Légion d'honneur by the French, and in June 1916 was awarded the honorary rank of major-general. On his return to England late in 1916 he was given a position in the Ministry of Munitions as an adviser on questions affecting the supplies of ammunition to the various armies. In June 1917 he was created a Knight Commander of the Bath for his wartime services. Callwell eventually relinquished his position in October 1918, to return to literature and journalism. In recognition of his wartime service he received the Order of the Rising Sun, 2nd Class, from Japan in October 1918, was made a Grand Officer of the Order of the Crown of Italy in November 1918, and a Commander of the Order of the Redeemer by the King of the Hellenes in October 1919. Callwell also received the Order of the Crown from Belgium, the Order of the Crown from Romania, the Order of Saint Stanislaus from Russia, and the Order of the White Eagle from Serbia. =Later career= From the time of the publication of Small Wars, Callwell had a reputation as a writer on military topics. Mainly these were studies on tactics and on subjects connected with the World War; he also produced works that satirized army procedure and War Office routine; this may have contributed to his being passed over for promotion. In 1921 he was awarded the Chesney medal of the Royal United Service Institution for his services to military literature. Major-General Callwell died at Queen Alexandra Military Hospital, Millbank, London, in May 1928. He never married.

The game was announced on March 12, 2014 and features turn-based combat and a crafting system. The game was soft launched March 17 on the Australia, New Zealand and Canada App Store, and was released worldwide on June 12, 2014. Plot The storyline begins with the player, playing as Red, trying to recover the stolen eggs by the Pigs. As the player progresses, new birds from the Angry Birds universe are added to the roster, including Chuck, Matilda, Bomb and the Blues (Jay, Jim and Jake). Players are limited to choosing three birds from their roster - and sometimes fewer - in the various battles against the pigs. Angry Birds Epic is set on Piggy Island, with its characters residing in the existing Angry Birds universe. Pigs and the birds take on various roles in the game's cutscenes. Angry Birds Epics Logo  Gameplay  Before every level, players can choose up to three birds (one extra from their Facebook friends in some levels) in their party, depending on the level. In the battle, enemies, mostly pigs, appear on a landscape. Battles may be normal, may involve multiple waves of enemies, or boss fights. To attack, players swipe from a bird to an enemy. To use a secondary skill (mostly defense types), the player taps the bird to use it on themselves, or swipes a bird into another bird to give it to the other bird. Whenever the birds attack or take damage, a \\"Rage Chili\\" indicator fills up at the bottom of the screen. When full, players can apply it to a bird to use their \\"rage\\" ability. After winning a battle, the players can earn up to three stars, depending on their performance in that battle. More stars indicates more resources that the players receive as a reward for winning the battle. The golden Lucky Coins, which are rare, are used to buy certain classes, spin the Golden Pig Machine for items, and to buy emergency consumables in battle. They can be earned by defeating a Golden Pig encountered across different levels, leveling up or through in-app purchases. The gameplay data can be backed up using a Rovio Account, which is now discontinued for registration ,How do I create a Rovio account? June 12, 2018. Retrieved September 15, 2018 so only existing accounts can back up their gameplay data. =Crafting system= Whenever the character is not in battle, players can equip and craft weapons, off-hand items, and consumable items. These items are obtained by crafting them with resources and spending another in-game currency called \\"Snoutlings\\", which are often dropped by defeated pigs or treasure chests. Whenever the player crafts or brews something, their quantity (Potions), damage (Weapons), or health (off-hand items) are increased by a random number from zero to three stars. =Multiplayer= In December 2014, Angry Birds Epic was updated to include a multiplayer mode. The Player Arena has weekly leagues that awards epic items to the top players.Rovio updates Angry Birds Epic RPG with player vs player gameplay. December 19, 2014 There are different tiers and the highest is the Diamond tier.  Events  The game periodically releases limited time events in which the player can collect event medals or resources, which can be exchanged for rare classes, currency, and items. So far there are only two events which were collaborations with other mobile games. The first one, Puzzle & Dragons event at October 2014 featured characters from the game as enemies, while some of the birds were limited-time allies in the mobile game of the same name. The second one, Sonic Dash event at September 2015, featuring Sonic as a playable \\"bird\\" and enemies from Sonic series, with Dr.Eggman as the boss enemy. Three of the birds were also limited-time playable characters in the mobile game of the same name. As of now, the game now cycles through all the events (excluding the collaboration ones). Reception The game has received generally favorable reviews with a Metacritic score of 70/100 based on 14 reviews. CNET praised the solid gameplay, but did not like the numerous in-app purchases combined with the slow delivery of in-game items, as well as the always online to play requirement.

It was built alongside the Gadsden Municipal Auditorium along the Coosa River. The American Legion, who owned the amphitheater, used it as a USO center during World War II to entertain soldiers stationed at Camp Sibert. Outside of wartime, it hosted boxing matches, concerts, plays, and political rallies, among other events. The City of Gadsden purchased the amphitheater in 1986 and began restoration of the facility. See also: Architecture Designed by local architect Paul W. Hofferbert, the amphitheater was constructed using stone quarried from Lookout Mountain. The seating area is a half-hexagon with the stage on the north end. The stage is partially covered by a timber-frame proscenium arch finished with stone. A club room, rectangular with a steeply pitched roof, sits to the northwest of the stage. Entrances to the amphitheater are behind the seating area, with a hexagonal gatehouse, and a lower entrance next to the club room, accessible through a stone-walled courtyard.

This disease is present at birth. TDO has been shown to occur in areas of close geographic proximity and within families; most recent documented cases are in Virginia, Tennessee, and North Carolina. The cause of this disease is a mutation in the DLX3 (distal-less 3) gene, which controls hair follicle differentiation and induction of bone formation. One-hundred percent of patients with TDO suffer from two co-existing conditions called enamel hypoplasia and taurodontism in which the abnormal growth patterns of the teeth result in severe external and internal defects. The hair defects are characterized as being rough, course, with profuse shedding. Hair is curly and kinky at infancy but later straightens. Dental defects are characterized by dark-yellow/brownish colored teeth, thin and/or possibly pitted enamel, that is malformed. The teeth can also look normal in color, but also have a physical impression of extreme fragility and thinness in appearance. Additionally, severe underbites where the top and bottom teeth fail to correctly align may be present; it is common for the affected individual to have a larger, more pronounced lower jaw and longer bones. The physical deformities that TDO causes become more noticeable with age, and emotional support for the family as well as the affected individual is frequently recommended. Adequate treatment for TDO is a team based approach, mostly involving physical therapists, dentists, and oromaxillofacial surgeons. Genetic counseling is also recommended.  Signs and symptoms  =Hair and bone abnormalities= Hair abnormalities are very prominent in majority of the cases of TDO. Kinky/curly hair that is unusually dry and easily sheds is present at birth. In 80% of cases, the hair has a more relaxed appearance by adolescence. The presence of this hair texture type is a defining characteristic between a diagnosis of TDO verses amelogenesis imperfecta with hypomaturation. Additionally, in TDO the nails are usually abnormally thin, brittle, and split frequently. Cranial deficiencies are marked by the presence of having a long skull relative to its width, or protrusive foreheads due to increased thickness of the cranial bones and premature closing of the associated sutures in the skull. The long bones in the body (arms, legs) are also abnormally long and tend to fracture very easily. Osteosclerosis, commonly seen in TDO cases is characterized by an increase in bone density, affecting the skull and the mastoid process located behind the jawbone on the skull, as well as a shortened ramus seen in people with TDO. There are no known pathological problems associated with hair and bone changes in people with this disease. Changes in the long bones tend to appear later in development, but changes in the teeth appear once the teeth being to form, called primary dentition. The hair and bone abnormalities are evaluated radiographically during initial diagnosis, and visually during the course of the disease. Radiographic exams may be repeated if there is suspect of fracture. =Oral abnormalities= Dental abscess commonly seen in people with underdeveloped tooth enamel caused by TDO. In the oral cavity 100% of people diagnosed with TDO have taurodontism which is characterized by vertically enlarged pulp chambers at the expense of the roots of the teeth; the floor of the pulp chamber and furcation is moved apically down. This is due to the failure of the Hertwig epithelial root sheath which maps the shape of the forming tooth roots during active differentiation. Amelogenesis imperfecta, an abnormal formation of the enamel or external layer of the crown of the tooth, may also be present where the tooth enamel may be thin or absent. There are several clinical subsets of amelogenesis imperfecta, but common to TDO is the hypoplastic-hypomaturation subtype; the hypomaturation-hypoplastic is less common in individuals with TDO. The difference between the 2 dominant subtypes is the changes seen in the enamel matrix, and the phenotypic type that predominates. The hypoplastic-hypomaturation type of amelogenesis imperfecta with TDO occurs where the tooth enamel depicts a generalized pitted pattern, with open contacts between the teeth as well as an open bite. A smaller number of cases are of the hypomaturation-hypoplastic case type, in which the enamel structure is softer due to the under maturation of ameloblasts during development. Mandibular prognathism also called a severe underbite, is also a prominent feature in TDO. Prognathism defects are diagnosed based the level of severity that this condition interferes with being able to chew or speak properly. Due to improper tooth development, TDO patients suffer from high rates of dental caries causing dental abscess. The under maturation of the enamel causes the tooth structure to be softer, and more susceptible to the effects of bruxism due to abnormalities in skeletal development. The oral abnormalities are evaluated by radiographs and visual examination. Oral radiographs are frequently repeated due to the high incidence of infection due to abnormal biting patterns seen in TDO cases.  Cause  an autosomal dominant pattern. A single copy of the abnormal gene from one parent is able to cause the disease; this is called autosomal dominance. A mutation in the DLX3 gene has been confirmed as the cause of TDO. The onset of TDO begins with a 4 base pair deletion on chromosome 17q21, causing a mutation, specifically frameshift, and the termination codon to be the cause of the lack of complete maturation of the tooth enamel; this mutation is also responsible for the osseous defects in the bone. DLX-3 is expressed in the placenta and is significantly important during embryonic development in regards to hard bone tissue which is present in the teeth, skull, and long bones such as in the arms and legs. During normal tooth development, DLX 3 shifts from predominant expression in the inner enamel epithelium; the outer layer does not express DLX 3. In TDO cases, the DLX-3 is present on the outer enamel epithelium and leads to the dental abnormalities seen in this disease. Improper expression of DLX-3 causes the tooth enamel to be thinner, which leads to attrition and is most often the cause of dental abscess seen in TDO persons. During osseous, connective tissue, and dermal cell differentiation, DLX 3 in TDO is also responsible for upper cranial thickness, calvaria, osteosclerosis of the long bones, long narrow head (dolichocephaly), abnormally thin brittle nails, and premature closing of fibrous joints. Consequently, 95% of people with TDO that are 16 years old or younger show skeletal abnormalities before full maturation takes place. Lack of mastoid pneumatization by mastoid cells occurs in 82% of the cases and is rarely prevalent outside of TDO diagnosis. Mastoid pneumatization occurs at about 6 months of ages and acts to minimize pressure fluctuations in the Eustachian tubes of the ear. The mastoid lies posterior to the lower jawbone (mandible) and distal to the ear. The Eustachian tube connects the middle ear to the back of the nose, and acts to create a specific pressure in the ear canal that causes vibrations to the eardrum; if adequate pressure is not attained, muffled, dull hearing results. In addition to the mastoid pneumatization assisting the Eustachian tubes for normal hearing, lack of mastoid pneumatization causes inflammation of the ear, general irritation, and does not allow enough air in to assist with mucus flowing out. It is not completely understood why gene mutations occur, but it is known that genetic mutations that cause disease are acquired from either or both parents at fertilization.  Diagnosis  TDO is a genetic based disorder it is diagnosed based on radiographic imaging, physical characteristics of the disease, and genetic testing if necessary. PCR amplification is used to check for normal and deletion allele, found in the 141 base pair allele. A four base pair deletion in exon 3 is also noted in patients with TDO; deletion in two transcription factor genes DLX-3 and DLX-7 gene (distal-less gene) that occurs by a frameshift mutation, makes this gene shorter than its normal length and non-functional. Radiographs such as cephalometric analysis or panoramic radiograph are used to detect skeletal abnormalities in TDO cases; these radiographs along with the phenotypic effects of the disease are often enough evidence for proper diagnosis. In TDO, radiologic imaging almost always shows evidence of hardening of bone tissue (sclerosis), lesions on the bone structures surrounding the teeth due to decay or trauma, or hard tissue mass. The radiographic testing is non-invasive, and involves the patient to be able to sit or stand in front of the radiographic device with their mouth closed and lips relaxed for approximately one minute. Oral abnormalities are diagnosed by a visual dental examination. A normal oral evaluation would show no signs of broken or fractured teeth, attrition of tooth enamel, no spacing between teeth, no soft tissue mass or sign of dental abscess, and a bite relationship where the mandibular (bottom) teeth interdigitate within a normal plane of 1-2mm behind and underneath the maxillary (top) teeth. = Overlapping diseases = It is phenotypically difficult to diagnose between TDO and Amelogenesis imperfecta of the hypomaturation-hypoplasia type with taurodontism (AIHHT) as they are very closely linked phenotypically during adulthood, and the only distinguishing characteristic is found during genetic analysis by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification. This type of test in diagnosis of TDO is only used during research or if there is a concern of genetic issue to a particular individual whose family member has been diagnosed with TDO.  Prevention  Preventive maintenance therapy for the oral effects of TDO involve frequent dental cleanings, professional application of desensitizing medication, diet counseling, and oral hygiene instructions in proper home care and maintenance; medicated dental rinses and toothpastes are also prescribed as people suffering from TDO are more prone to oral hard tissue disease and early tooth loss. If restorative dentistry is performed without orthodontics to correct the protrusion of the lower jaw, a dental night guard worn at bedtimes on the upper or lower teeth to protect them from the effects of grinding may be recommended. In extreme cases, tooth loss is inevitable, and the patient will consult with a prosthodontist to determine tooth replacement options such as dental implants, or partial dentures. There is no cure for TDO, but managing its oral and systemic affects is key to having the most favorable outcome from the disease. As the person affected by TDO ages, increased bone fractures may occur. The person suffering from TDO should watch for any pimple like masses on the gum tissue, pain or soreness in the teeth and gums, broken or chipped teeth, feeling of water in the ear or severe pain in the extremities which could indicate fracture.  Treatment  The hair, teeth, and skeletal side effects of TDO are lifelong, and treatment is used to manage those effects. A person with TDO has the same life expectancy as a person without TDO. There are no cures or medications used to treat systemic effects of TDO, but medications for the frequent ear and dental infections can be used to manage its symptoms. A team based approach between dental specialists, oral and maxillofacial surgeons, and physicians is necessary for treating the systemic effects and improves the prognosis. It is also recommended for affected individuals to seek counseling to be better able to cope with any psychosocial problems due to oral and facial abnormalities that occur with TDO. At home, a person suffering from TDO may be instructed to use frequent deep conditioning treatments and low manipulation hair styling to control shedding and hair loss. Clinical treatment involves the use of radiology to determine the effects that TDO has had on the surrounding teeth and bone structures. A series of appointments with the healthcare team are usually necessary to correct TDO abnormalities with treatment duration lasting from several months to through full oral- facial maturation stages. Endodontic procedures are routinely recommended due to treatdental pulp exposure or periodontal abscess. Maxillofacial surgery may be required to establish a more appropriate mastication, skeletal, and esthetic relationship vertically between the teeth to improve functioning. Esthetic procedures such as dental crown (dentistry) or veneer (dentistry) are often performed to improve the physical look of the teeth and to strengthen the weak enamel caused by TDO. endodontic file, and restoration with gutta- percha filling and a crown  Recent research  Amelogenesis imperfecta hypomaturation type with taurodontism are often confused. Amelogenesis imperfecta of the hypomaturation type with taurodontism (AIHHT) has no hair or bone changes which helps to differentiate between TDO cases and AIHHT. Polymerase chain reaction also known as PCR is used to amply pieces of DNA and observed for the 141 base pair allele as a result of a deletion of four nucleotides in exon 3 of the DLX-3 gene. Additionally, the current research shows that there is heavy reliance on the physical characteristics in the differentiation of TDO verses AIHHT and the severity and prevalence of their expression. For instance, taurodontism is severely expressed in TDO, but mildly expressed in AIHHT. Currently, researchers are trying to identify the reason for the alteration in the DLX-3 and DLX-7 genes that are responsible for AIHHT versus TDO.

Harris (1898–1969) was an entertainment executive from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He was the son of movie theater pioneer John P. Harris, and is best known as the long-time owner and impresario of the Ice Capades. He was also an early owner and promoter of professional ice hockey teams. He was married for ten years to ice skating star Donna Atwood. Early life John H. Harris, nicknamed \\"Johnny\\", was six years old in 1905 when his father and a partner opened their first Nickelodeon theater in Pittsburgh. At a young age, he showed an entrepreneurial bent by operating a lemonade stand and a successful paper route. He is said to have sold more peanuts than any other vendor at Forbes Field. After U.S. Army service in 1918, he transferred from Catholic University to Georgetown University, where he received a law degree in 1921. He worked in the family entertainment business during vacations from school, and entered it full-time upon graduation. Early career At Harris Amusement Companies, his first job was to manage the Strand Theater in Youngstown, Pennsylvania, and his second was to revive a vaudeville theater in McKeesport. By the time of his father's death in 1926, young Johnny was managing all the company's theaters outside of Pittsburgh. He soon increased the stable from 14 theaters to 25. Duquesne Gardens In the depression year of 1932, John leased the Duquesne Gardens arena and began offering a variety of entertainments. Like other arenas, these included skating, ice hockey, rodeo, boxing, bicycle racing, and more. The venture was successful, pulling the family company out of debt. In 1936, Harris founded the Pittsburgh Hornets, an American Hockey League team that was to play in Pittsburgh for 26 years. Harris brought in Olympic figure skater Sonja Henie to entertain the audience between periods of hockey games. On March 31, 1936, she created a local sensation when she performed at a playoff game between the Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets and the Atlantic City Seagulls. This event strengthened Harris' notion that ice skating could be a good spectator event, and he began to implement his plans for an ice spectacular. Ice Capades In February 1940, Harris and eight other arena managers met in Hershey, Pennsylvania, where Harris submitted a proposal to establish an ice show to play at their arenas. The proposal was greeted favorably, and the group organized the Ice Capades. Harris quickly took charge of the show, using his film and entertainment background to model it after Broadway theatre extravaganzas. He closely supervised every phase of the show, including the hiring of performers, who lived in a closely supervised boarding school atmosphere when they were traveling. One of the show's early performances was in Duquesne Gardens in September 1940. By 1945 it was playing in 20 North American cities, with only four weeks off in a year. Harris traveled with the Ice Capades for the first three weeks of every year's new show, and attended all 26 performances when it visited Pittsburgh. Printed programs for the shows featured the phrase \\"John H. Harris presents... Ice Capades.\\" In 1941 Harris hired 16-year-old figure skating champion Donna Atwood, who quickly became the star of the show, performing as such for fifteen years. He married her, 27 years his junior, in 1949; the couple divorced ten years later.\\"Obituaries: John H.

It is now within the Cape Cod National Seashore. Original Harbor Until the latter half of the nineteenth century, the East Harbor was a natural embayment deep enough to shelter Provincetown's fishing fleet during the winter, and was connected to Cape Cod Bay through a inlet. This effectively isolated neighboring Provincetown from Truro and other towns on Cape Cod. Until late in the 19th century, there was not a single road leading in or out of Provincetown – the only way to travel by land to the rest of Cape Cod was to first head north, traversing a series of tall, rolling sand dunes, and to then follow the thin strip of beach along the northern shore line, known as the \\"backshore\\". A wooden bridge was erected over the East Harbor in 1854, only to be destroyed by a winter storm and ice two years later. Although the bridge was replaced the following year, a traveler using it still had to traverse several miles over a sand route, which, together with the backshore route, would occasionally be washed out by storms. Prior to the railroad's arrival in 1873, Provincetown was like an island, in that it relied almost entirely upon the sea for its communication, travel, and commerce needs. Back Barrier Lagoon – Pilgrim Lake The harbor was artificially separated from Cape Cod Bay and cut off from tidal flow in 1868, when a dike was constructed across the inlet to facilitate the laying of track for the arrival of the railroad. The wooden bridge and sand road were finally replaced by a formal roadway in 1877. The exclusion of tides changed the harbor into a back barrier salt marsh lagoon. In the early 1900s, a real-estate developer named this lagoon \\"Pilgrim Lake\\", and the U.S. Geological Survey officially adopted that name in February 1910. But it also caused salinity to decline from natural levels of ~25-30 parts per thousand (ppt) to nearly freshwater by the time of the first documented fish survey in 1911. By this time the native estuarine fauna were largely extinguished. Over time, the blockage of tides had caused further ecological problems. The lack of tidal flushing deprived the system of salty, nutrient-poor, oxygen-rich Cape Cod Bay water and it became a stagnant freshwater pond. These conditions resulted in midge outbreaks, fish kills, and a proliferation of exotic species. After almost 140 years of impoundment, no native salt marsh vegetation was left in or around Pilgrim Lake. Instead, the floodplain was taken over by a non-native cattail species and some highly invasive plants like purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria) and common reed (Phragmites australis). Restoration After an oxygen depletion and fish kill in 2001, the town of Truro and the National Park Service began to explore options to restore the estuary. They focused on a drainage pipe connecting Pilgrim Lake to Cape Cod Bay. This ~, diameter culvert had been fitted with clapper valves to allow freshwater to drain out of Pilgrim Lake, but prevented marine tides from flowing back into the system. To restore partial tidal exchange and to improve water quality, they opened the clapper valves, which have remained open continuously since November 2002. Despite limits on tidal exchange imposed by the pipe's small diameter, and the distance that it travels underground, they have observed a substantial response in the recovery of salinity and estuarine biota. In June 2008, Pilgrim Lake was officially renamed back to its original moniker, East Harbor. The 720-acre East Harbor system, includes Moon Meadow, Salt Meadow and the East Harbor lagoon.

He is best known as vocalist and co-founder of the influential heavy metal band Dead End, active from 1984 to 1990. When they disbanded, Morrie began a solo career for five years, before moving to New York City and going into hiatus. He reemerged in 2005 with the solo project Creature Creature, which utilizes several well- known Japanese musicians, reunited with Dead End four years later, and released his first solo album in twenty years in 2015.  History  = 1980–1984: Career beginnings = Morrie joined his first band when he was in 11th grade, The Wild. It was a cover band, covering songs by artists like Queen and The Police. He later left The Wild, and joined the heavy metal band Liar in 1983. By the summer of 1984, Liar were touring heavily around the Japanese underground, and as a result, were starting to develop a small cult following. Despite this, however, Liar eventually ended up disbanding in the fall of 1984. = 1984–1995: Dead End and solo career = In December 1984, Morrie formed Dead End alongside his fellow former-Liar bandmate, Takahiro Kagawa, Tadashi Masumoto (\\"Crazy Cool Joe\\") and Masaaki Tano. Only he and Joe remained, although they were joined by Yuji Adachi (\\"You\\") and Masafumi Minato in 1987, just before they signed a major contract with Victor Entertainment. Although achieved only limited commercial success in their homeland until January 1990, they managed to have a contract with an American label with their songs and videos aired on MTV and radio stations. Morrie's distinctive visual appearance and rough vocal style inspired many later prominent musicians in Japan's visual kei movement. In 1990, Morrie started a solo career and gradually went to live in New York City. He was featured in productions by Roli Mosimann, and on Infected and Mind Bomb by The The. Ultimately, Mosimann would produce all three of Morrie's studio albums. His first solo release was the single \\"Paradox\\" on October 21, 1990, and exactly one month later his debut solo album, \\"Ignorance\\", was published. In the upcoming five years, he released a few more singles (his second, \\"Shisen no Kairaku\\", featured a cover of \\"In My Room\\" by The Walker Brothers) and two more studio albums, Romantic na, Amari ni Romantic na in 1992 and Kage no Kyoen in 1995, before seemingly withdrawing from the public eye for almost ten years. = 2005–present: Return to music and Creature Creature = In 2005, Morrie's solo best of album Ectoplasm was released and marked his return to music. At the end of the year he announced the formation of his rock band Creature Creature, that included bassist Tetsuya (from L'Arc~en~Ciel), guitarist Minoru Kojima (from The Mad Capsule Markets), and drummer Shinya Yamada (from Luna Sea). They performed at the year-end event Danger IV at Nippon Budokan as a secret musical act. In 2006, three singles were released on the same day of July, and on August 30 their debut studio album Light&Lust; was released on Danger Crue Records. During the album's recording, Morrie was joined by Dead End members You, Minato and Joe, and their producer Hajime Okano, who each contributed to several songs. Morrie said it was a moving moment for him, and said about the meeting that \\"I was curious what kind of musician and persons they became. After they played I started thinking that a Dead End reunion would be extraordinary\\". The band performed only two times that year, at the next Danger V event and the held Light&Lust; concert at Shibuya-AX in December. It was quiet for another two years, until June 2009, when two Creature Creature concerts in Tokyo and Osaka were held starting the Simone and the Wrath tour series, but with different a line-up, featuring guitarist Hiro (from La'cryma Christi), guitarist Shinobu (from Guy's Family), bassist Hitoki (from Kuroyume), and drummer Sakura (from L'Arc~en~Ciel). In August, Morrie and the other Dead End members reunite, and held a their first concert in almost twenty years. In November they released their new album and did not stop with activity in upcoming years. In December, with Creature Creature, Morrie held two concerts in Shanghai, China, and performed at the Jack in the Box and Beat Shuffle events at Nippon Budokan and Omiya Sonic City respectively. On July 21, 2010, Creature Creature's second studio album Inferno was released and throughout this and next year they held the smaller Purgatory, Inferno, and Paradise tours. The single \\"Psyche Telos\\" was released on June 12, 2011 by Psyche Records, a record label owned by Morrie. In September they went on the Exorcising Orpheus tour, and released a live concert video of the same name recorded at the Paradise tour finale. In June and August 2012, the singles \\"Rakuen/Ataraxia\\" and \\"Kurumeki/Sexus\\", as well as the Sodom and Gomorah tour, were followed by the release on October 17 of the band's third studio album Phantoms. In 2012, Morrie performed his first solo live concert in twenty years. Extasis was held on his birthday, where he performed old and new songs. The following year he held The Nostalgia of the Infinite birthday and two Nowhere Nobody concerts. In 2014 for his fiftieth anniversary was held the third consecutive birthday concert, Now I Here Eternity, with Sugizo, Kiyoharu, You and Joe as special guests. In May was followed by the Boys of the Flesh concert. On December 25, 2014 was pre- released Morrie's fourth studio album Hard Core Reveire, and first in almost twenty years. It was generally released on January 21, 2015 on Morrie's indie label Nowhere Music. The album's music is uniquely experimental, while the concept is that the reality is a dream, a hardcore illusion of waking up. On March 4, was released a limited to 500 copies half-century commemorative work Book of M: From Nowhere To Nowhere based on the concept \\"from birth to death\\", accompanied with a 25-minute long DVD. Over the years he continued to perform his Solitude one-man solo shows. Morrie featured on three songs from Aoki Yutaka's album Lost in Forest, and one song, for which he also contributed the lyrics, to the album Oneness M by Sugizo. On March 15, 2017, Creature Creature's released their fourth studio album Death is a Flower, and the band held the second part of its tour between December 2016 and March 2017. Because they felt they had \\"come full circle\\" conceptually with Death is a Flower, and because Morrie wanted to focus on his solo activities, Creature Creature went on hiatus after July 8, 2018. On August 27, 2017, Morrie performed an intimate solo show at Kraine Theater in New York City. It was his first official solo live performance outside Japan. He reprised the performance at Kraine Theater on January 31, 2018, with a third performance scheduled for August 26 as part of his solo tour Morrie the Universe \\"Solitude\\" Season 6 which started in September. His fifth solo studio album, In The Shining Wilderness, was released on April 19, and was followed by a solo tour with a band in February and March, and then until December 2019 by his 7th solo Solitude tour series.  Musical style and lyrics  Morrie's lyrics throughout his career were inspired by philosophical questions about the human being, I, good and evil, justice, truth, beauty, as well those people who devoted their lives trying to solve them. Compared to Dead End, in Creature Creature, he freely explores his ideas with other musicians and the creation is \\"more centripetal with lyrical content evoked by philosophical questions of being and what is I\\". In the classical music he is especially fond of Richard Wagner and Johann Sebastian Bach.

The team participates in the East Division of the Mid-American Conference (MAC). The Bulls are currently led by first year coach Scott Smith, who took over in 2019 when the previous coach, Blair Brown Lipsitz, resigned. Smith was an assistant for four years under Lipsitz, and this is his first head coaching job at the NCAA level. The team plays its home games at Alumni Arena, located on the university's campus. Recent history In 2013, under head coach Todd Kress, Buffalo finished 6–10 in the MAC, which was their most wins ever in conference; however, they finished 9th in Conference because of unfavorable tie-breakers and so the Bulls did not advance to the Conference Tournament (only the top 8 teams advance). Kress was fired after the season. In 2014, under head coach Reed Sunahara, Buffalo finished 6–10 again, but this time they were 8th in the Conference, and for the first time in program history, the Bulls qualified for the round of eight in the Conference Tournament. Buffalo lost to Western Michigan 3–0 in that tournament game. Sunahara resigned to coach at West Virginia. Buffalo hired Lipsitz, who had never coached before at the collegiate level. Buffalo finished the 2015 season at 6–10 in the MAC again, but this time it was good for 7th place based on tie-breakers, the team's highest finish ever in the MAC. In the MAC Tournament, Buffalo lost to Ball State 3–1, marking the first- ever victory in a set in a MAC Tournament Round of 8 match in the team's history. In 2016, Buffalo struggled and finished 3–13 in the MAC and did not make the MAC tournament. In 2017, Buffalo had its best year ever in the MAC, passing the previous high of 6 wins, with an 8–8 record and the #5 seed into the MAC tournament. In 2018, Buffalo again surpassed its previous win record in the MAC, finishing 10–6, and had the #4 seed in the MAC tournament. The Bulls did not win a MAC tournament match under Lipsitz. In 2019, after a 1–5 start, Smith coached the Bulls to an 8–8 record in the MAC, defeating three teams that were leading the MAC at the time of the match. Buffalo would be the #7 seed in the MAC Tournament, and they won their very first ever MAC Tournament \\"Round of 8\\" match, defeating #6 Akron 3–0. The Bulls then lost in the next round. MAC honorees Buffalo has had several players in recent history earn All-MAC honors. In 2011, right-side hitter Liz Scott was named to the All-MAC Freshman team. In 2012, Scott was named to the All-MAC Second team. In 2013 and 2014, outside hitter Tahleia Bishop was named First Team All-MAC. In 2013, libero Kelly Svoboda was also named First Team All-MAC. The awards to Bishop and Svoboda in 2013 were the first-ever First Team All-MAC awards for any Bull. In addition, Svoboda was named MAC Defensive Player of the Year, the only Bull to ever win a MAC individual honor in volleyball. In 2014, middle blocker Cassie Shado was named to the All-MAC Freshman team, and in 2015 Shado and senior outside hitter Megan Lipski were named All-MAC Honorable Mention.

Description  The Cliff House Sandstone consists of fine grained white to orange calcareous sandstone. It intertongues with the underlying Menefee Formation and the overlying Lewis Shale.Hayes and Zapp 1955 Where the Lewis Shale pinches out in the southwest San Juan Basin, the formation is indistinguishable from the Pictured Cliffs Formation and the name \\"Pictured Cliffs\\" is applied to the entire sequence of massive sandstone.Beaumont et al. 1956 The formation is exposed at Mesa Verde National Park, where it forms the prominent cliffs around Cliff House, for which it is named. It is also prominent at Chaco Canyon.National Park Service 2015 At Chaco Canyon, the formation can be divided into three informal members. These are a lower massive marine sandstone deposited in a high-energy environment; a middle unit deposited in deeper water that contains some shale beds; and an upper sandstone deposited in a beach and bar environment. The formation is part of the Mesaverde Group of the San Juan Basin, which records a regression-transgression sequence of the Western Interior Seaway. The Cliff House Sandstone was deposited during the return of the sea as near-shore sand.Fillmore 2011  History of investigation  The Cliff House Sandstone was first described by W.H.Holmes in 1877 during the Hayden Survey as the \\"Upper Escarpment\\" of the Mesaverde Formation.Holmes 1877 A.J. Collier redesignated this unit in 1919 as the Cliff House Sandstone and raised the Mesaverde Formation to group rank.Collier 1919  Stratigraphy  Upper Cretaceous stratigraphy of the San Juan Basin  Fossil content  Outcrops of the formation in Mesa Verde National Park have produced fossil shark teeth along with the jaws, teeth and fins of Enchodus. At Chaco Canyon, the lower beds produce shells and casts from clams, ammonites (including possible Placenticeras), snails, and shark's teeth. Trace fossils classified as Ophiomorpha nodosa are common and are thought to have been produced by Callianasa shrimp. The middle unit hyas fewer trace fossils but more Inoceramus, while the upper beds are rich in invertebrate shells, shark teeth, and bone debris from marine lizards.

The film follows the experimental physicists at CERN who run the experiments, as well as the theoretical physicists who attempt to provide a conceptual framework for the LHC's results. The film begins in 2008 with the first firing of the LHC and concludes in 2012 with the successful identification of the Higgs boson. The Communication Awards of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine awarded a $20,000 prize for excellence in communicating science to the general public in Film/Radio/TV to David Kaplan and Mark Levinson for \\"Particle Fever\\" on October 14, 2015. The awards are given to individuals in four categories: books, film/radio/TV, magazine/newspaper and online, and are supported by the W. M. Keck Foundation. Synopsis The film is composed of two narrative threads. One follows the large team of experimental physicists at CERN as they try to get the LHC running properly. After a promising initial test run, the LHC suffers a liquid helium leak in 2007 that damages its electromagnets. Fabiola Gianotti, Martin Aleksa, and Monica Dunford are all shown discussing how to handle the negative publicity surrounding the accident, and how to proceed. After repairs in 2009, the LHC begins to run experiments again at half power. The other thread follows the competing theories of Nima Arkani-Hamed and his mentor Savas Dimopoulos. In the film, Arkani-Hamed advocates for the \\"multiverse\\" theory, which predicts the mass of the Higgs boson to be approximately 140 giga- electronvolts. Dimopoulos argues for the more-established supersymmetry theory, which predicts the mass of the Higgs boson to be approximately 115 GeV. The narrative threads combine at the end of the film, when CERN announces the confirmed existence of a Higgs-like particle, with a mass of approximately 125 GeV. The discovery of the particle is met with a standing ovation, and Peter Higgs is shown wiping away tears. However, neither of the competing theories of the universe is definitively supported by the finding. Later, Kaplan is shown admitting that none of his theoretical models are supported by this finding, and that the long-term implications of the discovery are unclear. Production The film was shot over a period of seven years. It was directed by Mark Levinson, a former theoretical physicist with a doctorate from UC-Berkeley. Levinson produced the film along with David Kaplan, a professor of physics at Johns Hopkins University and producers Andrea Miller, Carla Solomon and Wendy Sax. The team gathered nearly 500 hours of footage from both professional camera crews and amateur video self-recordings shot by the physicists themselves. This footage was then edited by Walter Murch, who had previously won Academy Awards for his work on Apocalypse Now and The English Patient. Kaplan worked closely with MK12 to create the animated sequences which are used throughout the film. The film premiered at Sheffield Doc/Fest on July 14, 2013. Release David Kaplan, Mark Levinson, and Meredith Wadman discuss the film in New York City on January 2014. Particle Fever was shown at several festivals before opening in limited release in the United States on March 5, 2014. =Critical response= The film received critical acclaim, with reviewers praising the film for making theoretical arguments seem comprehensible, for making scientific experiments seem thrilling, for making particle physicists seem human, and for promoting physics outreach. Several reviewers singled out Murch's editing for praise. On his blog, theoretical physicist and string theory critic Peter Woit called the film \\"fantastically good\\", but cautioned that Arkani-Hamed's linking of the Higgs boson to multiverse theory was a tenuous proposition, as this theory did not currently make testable predictions. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 96% based on 48 reviews, with an average rating of 7.92 out of 10. The site's consensus states: \\"The concepts behind its heady subject matter may fly over the heads of most viewers, but Particle Fever presents it in such a way that even the least science-inclined viewers will find themselves enraptured.\\" On Metacritic, the film has an 87 out of 100 rating, based on 18 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\".  Awards  In 2016, it was one of the inaugural winners of the Stephen Hawking Medal for Science Communication.

It originally aired on October 21, 2010. The episode was written by Elizabeth Craft and Sarah Fain and directed by John Behring. Plot The episode starts with the scenes switching between Elena (Nina Dobrev) with Stefan (Paul Wesley) and Katherine with Mason (Taylor Kinney) waking up together. Elena and Stefan talk about how to keep hiding from Katherine and she keeps feeding Stefan with her blood, meanwhile Katherine tries to make Mason tell her where he hid the moonstone, however he tells her that it is safe and that he will give it to her later that night. Jeremy (Steven R. McQueen) pays a visit to Damon (Ian Somerhalder) because he wants to help, as he says, and tells Damon what he has learnt about werewolves from Tyler (Michael Trevino) and that Mason is looking for a moonstone. Alaric (Matt Davis) arrives with more information from Isobel's research that says that moonstones can be used to seal a curse and they wonder if Mason wants it so he can reverse the werewolf curse. Everyone is at the preparations for the Masquerade Ball and Elena gets the chance to fill Bonnie (Kat Graham) in on everything around Katherine and what she was doing all this time with Caroline (Candice Accola) and her fake fights with Stefan. Meanwhile, Mason looks surprised to see Stefan alive and he asks him what they did to Sheriff Forbes (Marguerite MacIntyre). Stefan reassures him that Liz is fine and Mason leaves. While walking away, Mason bumps into Bonnie who gets a vision of him and \\"Elena\\". She tells Stefan about it and he figures out that Bonnie did not see Elena kissing Mason but Katherine. Stefan informs Damon about the connection between Mason and Katherine and they are sure that Katherine is using him for something and they need to find out what. Jeremy offers his help and says that he can take the moonstone from Tyler, but Tyler gave the moonstone to Mason because he doesn't want to have anything to do with curses and supernatural anymore. Stefan and Damon ask for Bonnie's help so they can \\"kidnap\\" Mason and make him tell them Katherine's plan and where the moonstone is. Even though at first Bonnie does not want to help, she eventually agrees to do it. In the meantime, Caroline is at the basement with her mom and tries to explain to her about her new life. Liz listens to her and even though she is negative with Caroline at the beginning, Liz ends up telling her that she doesn't have to compel her because she will never do anything to hurt her. Caroline believes her but she knows that Liz will never trust Damon and Stefan, so she compels her to forget everything and think that she has been sick with the flu for the past couple of days. Damon and Bonnie arrive at the Salvatore house with Mason and Damon ties him up to question him while Bonnie tries to read his mind with her powers to find out where the moonstone is. She tells Damon that the moonstone is in a well and heads out when Mason wakes up. On her way out, she runs into Caroline and tells her that she is going to the old well at the Lockwood property. Caroline wants to go with her and Bonnie texts Stefan where he can find the moonstone. He heads there and Elena follows him. Damon starts questioning Mason about Katherine but he refuses to say anything, leading Damon to torture him. After a while, Mason tells Damon where the moonstone is, but Damon wants to know why Katherine wants it. Mason says she wants it to reverse the werewolf curse because she loves him, something that makes Damon burst out laughing. He tells Mason that Katherine is just using him and when he realizes that Mason does not know anything more that could help him, he kills him. In the meantime, Stefan gets to the well with Elena and he jumps in to search for the moonstone, but the water is full of vervain and he starts screaming for help. Caroline and Bonnie find them, and they help Elena to get down to Stefan. She ties the unconscious Stefan to the chain and tells Caroline to pull him up while she is searching for the moonstone. She finds it and Caroline pulls her up where she gives Stefan her blood to help him heal faster. Stefan returns home where Damon tries to get rid of Mason's body. He texts Carol (Susan Walters) from Mason's phone to tell her that he left town and then calls Katherine despite Stefan's warning not to. Katherine is surprised and when Damon reveals to her that Mason is dead and they have the moonstone, she reassures him that she has a Plan B. Alaric and Jenna (Sara Canning) are having dinner when Elena get home. Katherine calls and asks for Elena telling her that she knows about her fake fights with Stefan because she had warned Jenna off of vervain and could control her and Jenna has been informing her about everything. In the background, Jenna stabs herself while under Katherine's compulsion and collapses. Alaric and Elena take her to the hospital and doctor informs them that she will be fine. Elena, after what happened with Jenna, goes to Stefan to tell him that they were fools to ignore Katherine's orders and to fool her. They cannot be together because they put the ones they love in danger and she breaks up with him. The episode ends with Katherine compelling Matt (Zach Roerig) to attack Tyler and won't step back until Tyler kills him because as she says she needs a werewolf and since Mason is gone, she needs a new one.

Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic rated the episode with 4.8/5 saying that the episode was dark, shocking and exciting. \\"Did anyone actually expect Damon to kill Mason?!? Shades of this vampire's humanity appeared to be coming out after he realized Mason was just like him (only less dashing and intelligent), seduced by Katherine's charms and being manipulated. But that's what makes Damon such an intriguing character.\\" Diana Steenbergen from IGN rated the episode with 8.5/10 praising Candice Accola's acting: \\"Every episode I find myself having more good things to say about Candice Accola's portrayal of Caroline. While this week has the very sad (and real) breakup of Stefan and Elena, it is Caroline's time spent with her mother that is the most heartbreaking. [...] The journey Accola is taking Caroline through this season continues to be one of the more compelling storylines on the show.\\" Josie Kafka of Doux Reviews rated the episode with 3.9/4 thanking the writers (Elizabeth Craft and Sarah Fain) for their work on the episode. \\"Elizabeth Craft and Sarah Fain have worked on some great shows, but I never loved their episodes on Angel or Dollhouse. So I was both nervous and excited when I saw that this was their first VD episode. And then I forgot all about both nerves and excitement, as I was too busy hooting with merriment and then, at the end, gasping a \\"No they didn’t!\\" at the unanswering TV screen. And then doing it again, five minutes later.\\" Alyse Wax from Fearnet gave a good review to the episode saying that it was good and brutal. \\"I don’t think I have ever seen such intense torture on network television. I honestly did not see it coming that Jenna would be compelled to stab herself. It was an intense episode, with lots of darkness, and not too much mushy-gushy stuff.\\" Reagan from The TV Chick gave a B+ rate to the episode saying that it was another great one with a lot of information and several touching moments. \\"I can’t wait for the masquerade ball and to see who else will crop up this season (surely we’re not going to fight only Katherine and it’s still early in the season). [...] My score’s a little lower because I really think they killed off Hot Uncle Mason a little early.\\" Despite the positive reaction, Robin Franson Pruter of Forced Viewing rated the episode with 2/4 saying that the episode had a few good scenes but was hampered by excessive violence. \\"The violence in this episode is unrelenting and largely unmotivated. I felt bad for Mason. [...] The torture scenes that follow are out of character for Damon and extreme enough to make even Dick Cheney uncomfortable. [...] The violence wouldn’t bother me so much if it was 1) in character; 2) in service of good-storytelling; or 3) socially responsible. Damon is erratic but not a sadist.\\" References External links * Category:2010 American television episodes Category:The Vampire Diaries (season 2) episodes ","title":"Plan B (The Vampire Diaries)"},{"id":"42189620","text":"Portrait of Peter Scheemakers, 1776 Andreas Bernardus de Quertenmont (1 February 1750, in Antwerp – 3 June 1835, in Antwerp) was a Flemish painter, copyist, engraver and etch artist.

He is best known for his precise bold line work and graphic reinterpretation of mid-twentieth century comics, magazines, advertising, and other popular culture from the period. History and influences Until the age of nine, Brooks lived with his parents and grandparents in Warminster, Pennsylvania. His grandfather, an immigrant brick layer from Piacenza, Italy, built the house by hand. By this time, Brooks's father had returned from World War II, and, in order to raise his family, had abandoned his pursuit of having a career as a comic strip artist. Brooks found himself immersed in his father's art supplies and discarded sketch books of unfinished comic strips, and easily took to drawing cartoons at an early age.\\"Lou Brooks - Cartoonists Survey #250\\" David Wasting Paper Retrieved 14 March 2014. In 1954, he and his family moved to Levittown, Pennsylvania, and a life of postwar conformity in a community of over 17,000 assembly-line homes on 22 square miles. It was the largest suburban planned community in the United States.Wagner, Richard and Amy Duckett, Images of America: Levittown (Charleston SC: Arcadia Publishing, 2010), p. 7. . Living there greatly affected what was to become Brooks's lifelong aversion to sameness. Nevertheless, the suburban baby boomer popular culture of the 1950s,Hine, Thomas, Populuxe (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., 1986) . which included comic books, cars, rock and roll music, and television, influenced Brooks's sensibilities to a large extent. His career in art began in 1965 as a production artist in the advertising art department of a Philadelphia newspaper, which he credits as giving him a thorough well-rounded knowledge of the graphic arts.

The film had its world premiere on March 9, 2014, at South by Southwest. It stars Naya Rivera as a woman caught amidst ghostly events. Plot A teenage girl (Ashley Rickards) is told by her new boyfriend that she can get $500 by playing a game run by an old man living in a trailer. After she wins the game, the old man (Michael Massee) instructs her to go to the crossroads and say her name so that \\"he\\" will know whom to take. At home later that night, the girl hears voices before being lifted into the air. A real estate agent Leigh (Catalina Sandino Moreno) is trying to sell the home of Chuck (Dan Roebuck) and Royanna (Jan Broberg). While going over the various details of the couple's property, Leigh mentions that she saw a young girl inside their home. The couple assume that Leigh saw their missing daughter, Charlene, who ran away with her boyfriend several months earlier. When Leigh goes back to the couple's house she finds \\"Charlene.\\" Leigh calls Chuck to let him know that she found Charlene; however, Chuck tells Leigh that police found his daughter at a local mall hours ago. Puzzled, Leigh looks at the files from the couple's home and finds an article with \\"Charlene's\\" picture in it. Leigh realizes that the girl she had seen was actually Hannah White, a girl who had committed suicide in 1987. Leigh notices Hannah is missing and tries to look for her in the house. She finds Hannah in an empty room staring into a mirror. When Leigh tries to speak with Hannah, she is attacked by some unseen force, falls to the floor, and dies. The coroner tells Leigh's sister Vera (Naya Rivera) that she died of natural causes. Later in Leigh's home, Vera finds Leigh's files from the couple's house and visits Hannah's old childhood friend. Hannah's friend reveals that Hannah had been pregnant before she died. Many people believed that Hannah had committed suicide because of her pregnancy. However, Hannah's friend insists that Hannah had been a virgin, and that she may have killed herself to stop her supernatural child from being born. Since Hannah had killed herself, the demon that had tried to possess her child instead took over her body until it could find another vessel. Vera returns to her home, where she is assaulted by a demonic force that throws her through a window to fall two stories. Vera wakes up in a hospital; she has been in a coma for eight months. The doctor tells her she was pregnant when it happened. During her ultrasound, Vera sees a demonic face on the monitor and demands an immediate C-section. Six years later, Vera visits her daughter, who has been adopted by another woman. Vera tells the girl that she knows who the little girl really is and demands to know why she was chosen. The girl flees. Vera chases her to an abandoned house in the woods and attempts to kill her. Unable to do so, Vera leaves, taking her daughter with her.

Filming was completed in January 2013. Reception Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 43% of 23 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating was 6.08/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \\"At the Devil's Door has no shortage of creepy style -- unfortunately, that isn't enough to distract from an uninspired story that never capitalizes on its potential.\\" Metacritic gave it a weighted average score of 47 out of 100, based on 8 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Writing in Variety, Dennis Harvey stopped short of recommending the film, but praised some aspects of it, stating, \\"Though disappointing content- wise, McCarthy’s sophomore feature still demonstrates admirable attention to things that usually suffer in more superficially flashy horror efforts, notably credible real-world backgrounding (the nondescript Southern California locations suggest a middle class slipping haplessly toward poverty), naturalistic perfs, and habit of favoring creepy restraint over “gotcha!” moments. (Still, the pic could have used one or two more of the latter.) Tech and design contributions are likewise thoughtful.\\" Alan Scherstuhl wrote a similar review in The Village Voice, writing, \\"McCarthy shows he's mastered the things we already know scare us onscreen; next, how about something we don't expect?\\" Fearnet called At the Devil's Door \\"impressive work\\" and remarked that \\"it works as a slick and admirably unpredictable whole, and it somehow seems to work as three distinct chapters as well.\\" We Got This Covered gave a mixed review, stating that the film was \\"a bone-chilling ghost story that I'd absolutely love to recommend, but once again I struggled to keep a constant connection to Nicholas McCarthy's befuddling screenplay, packed with exciting ideas and bright moments of sheer terror – but nothing consistently worthwhile.\\" Best Horror Movie's review said, \\"When you incorporate three extremely powerful performances from three extremely attractive young ladies (Catalina Sandino Moreno as Leigh, Ashley Rickards as Hannah and Naya Rivera as Vera) you've got a very real recipe for success.\\" EFilmCritic.com praised the performances: \\"They're good enough to make the end more satisfying than it initially appears after things have sunken in a bit, even if the movie does occasionally seem to be setting up something a little more grandiose.\\" Sound on Sight wrote, \\"Supporting the scares is a strong cast\\".

The deity is believed to guard the village against disasters and bring it fortune. Etymology Thành hoàng is a Sino-Vietnamese word, literally means the city wall and the moat that surrounds it. Origin No later than Đinh dynasty, each locality started to worship the mountain and river gods that ruled over a domain which encompassed their village. Later on, the government decreed the deification of late national heroes, righteous officials and loyal subjects, and specific localities were chosen to exalt these gods. Gradually other common folks took up the practice and worshipped their own gods to be blessed with protection and fortune.Phan Kế Bính, Vietnamese Customs, Ho Chi Minh City Publishing house, 1990 edition, p.78-79. Ranking Generally each village worships only one Thành Hoàng; however, it is not rare to see two or more gods enshrined simultaneously at a village.

Even these Gods were divided in three ranks * High ranking gods: famous mountain and river gods, immortals such as Thánh Gióng, Chử Đồng Tử whose backgrounds are mysterious and miraculous, and unusually brilliant men such as Lý Thường Kiệt and Trần Hưng Đạo. * Middle ranking gods: whose accomplishments are ambiguous but have been worshiped for a long time * Lower ranking gods: whose background and accomplishments are ambiguous but are known to bless mortals Apart from the ranked gods acknowledged by the government, there were villages that worshiped \\"demons\\" and \\"tainted gods\\" such as the Beggar God, the Serpent God, the God of Lecherousness, and others.

As of 2000, about 500,000 in the Chicago area identified themselves as being Italian descent.Vecoli, Rudolph J. \\"Italians\\" (Archive). Encyclopedia of Chicago. Retrieved on March 13, 2014. History The first Italian to come to what would become Chicago was Enrico (Henri) Tonti, a Neapolitan soldier in service of the French. In the Fall of 1680, Tonti was in the la Salle Expedition and 2nd in command of the company. He and Father Membré, passed through the Chicago portage from the Illinois valley to go to Green Bay (having reached the Illinois River with La Salle by way of the Kankakee portage). On Jan. 7, 1682, Tonti met La Salle at Chicago, and together with a group of 21 additional Frenchmen and 30 Indians they used the portage on their way to the Mississippi, the mouth of which they reached on April 9, 1682.http://www.earlychicago.com/encyclopedia.php?letter=t&sel;=La%20Salle#e2633 In 1697, Henri Tonti, Michel Accault, and François de la Forêt received permission from Governor Frontenac to establish a fortified trading post at Chicagou managed by Pierre de Liette, Tonti's cousin, a Franco-Italian, which lasted until c.1705. De Liette kept a journal of his experiences living with the Illinois natives for those years he lived with them at the Chicago trading post. De Liette divided his time from 1691 to 1705 between the Miami at Chicago and the Illinois at Fort St. Louis de Pimiteoui, Peoria, which he had helped build. In Chicago, he ran a trading post in partnership with François Daupin de la Forêt, Michel Accault, and Henri de Tonti [located probably near today's Tribune Tower] which he had to close, leaving in 1705 after the king revoked his trading license; continued as French commander and trader in the Illinois country until 1720. From Liette's memoirs: \\"Most beautiful, you begin to see its fertility at Chicago, unwooded prairies, requiring only to be turned up by the plow, most temperate climate.\\" http://www.earlychicago.com/encyclopedia.php?letter=l&sel;=Liette#e1899 In the 1850s, Italians settled in Chicago. Originally, most were Genoese. The first generation worked primarily as merchants, restaurateurs, and fruit sellers. Some worked in the plaster industry.Candeloro, Dominic. \\"Chicago's ITALIANS: IMMIGRANTS, ETHNICS, ACHIEVERS, 1850-1985\\" (Archive). Illinois Periodicals Online (IPO), Northern Illinois University. Retrieved on March 13, 2014. The plaster workers originated from Lucca.Candeloro, \\"Chicago's Italians, A Survey of the Ethnic Factor, 1850-1990,\\" p. 229. A second wave of immigration, this time from rural areas in southern and central Italy, arrived between 1880 and 1914. As of 2014, most Italian Americans in Chicago were descended from this immigration wave, which consisted mainly of young men, mostly illiterate and low-income. In 1920, Chicago had the third-largest ethnic Italian population in the nation, surpassed only by New York City and Philadelphia. Rudolph J. Vecoli wrote that Al Capone had damaged the reputation of the Italian community in Chicago. Dominic Candeloro, author of Italians in Chicago, 1945-2005, stated that \\"ballpark\\" estimates were that between 1945 and 2005, 25,000 Italians, including recent immigrants from Calabria, Apulia, and Sicily, arrived in Chicago.Candeloro, Italians in Chicago, 1945-2005, p. 7. The Italians who came in this wave were more nationalistic, entrepreneurial and educated than those of previous waves. The Italians settled in Addison, Berwyn, Elmwood Park, Melrose Park, Norridge, Westchester and elsewhere. But now many Italian residents of Elmwood Park and Melrose Park have moved out of the area and the area now has an increase of Hispanics living there which has started sometime in the 80s and 90s. Many of the Italian residents grew old and died and new Italian residents have not moved into those towns. Candeloro wrote that they \\"rescued Italian American life in the city from a total meltdown, injected new enthusiasm into dying institutions and new organizations like the Italian Cultural Center\\". In the post-World War II era, many Little Italies in Chicago disappeared. Some were demolished to make way for new institutions and structures. The University of Illinois Chicago, highways, and public housing replaced former Italian neighborhoods. This caused increasing numbers of Italians to move to suburbs west of Chicago. In 1970, there were 202,373 Italian immigrants and children of Italian immigrants living in the Chicago area, making up about 3% of the total population. By 1970, a majority of the ethnic Italians in the Chicago area lived in suburban communities such as Berwyn, Cicero, and Oak Park. That year, Rudolph J. Vacoli stated that \\"vestiges\\" of former Italian American communities within Chicago still existed. Geography As of 1980, 20,000 of the 138,000 ethnic Italians in the City of Chicago lived in Belmont-Cragin, Dunning, and Montclare areas, giving them the highest concentrations of ethnic Italians. The area at the intersection of 24th Street and Oakley Avenue, southwest of the Chicago Loop, had a group of people from Tuscany, with many from Bagni di Lucca, Montecatini Terme, and Ponte Buggianese. Many of the residents of this area worked at the McCormick Reaper plant. A man who grew up in the neighborhood, Peter Venturelli, wrote a dissertation about it. Candeloro wrote that this area was \\"perhaps the best preserved Little Italy\\" in Chicago in the year 1990.Candeloro, \\"Chicago's Italians, A Survey of the Ethnic Factor, 1850-1990,\\" p. 232. The first Italian American community in Chicago was located near what is now the Merchandise Mart in the Near North Side and had residents from Genoa and Lucca. An area known as \\"Little Hell\\" and \\"Little Sicily\\" in the Near North Side had, by 1920, 20,000 Italian Americans and Italian immigrants.Candeloro, \\"Chicago's Italians, A Survey of the Ethnic Factor, 1850-1990,\\" p. 231. An area near Polk Street Station in the southern end of the Chicago Loop had residents from Ricigliano, Salerno. The community around Santa Maria Addolorata Church in the near northwest side had residents from Bari, Sicily and elsewhere in Italy. The Taylor Street neighborhood in the Near West Side had residents from Abruzzo, Bari, Basilicata, Calabria, Lucca, Marche, Messina, Naples, Palermo and Salerno. The Grand Crossing area had Calabrian migrants, and the area at the intersection of 69th Street and Hermitage had migrants from Salerno. Roseland had an Italian community from Piedmont. Pullman had an Italian community originating from the Altopiano di Asiago, Veneto; many of the residents were brickmakers. Many Italians (along with Germans) lived in the area north of the Chicago river in Lincoln Park, Chicago. In 1936, a statue of Giuseppe Garibaldi was unveiled in Lincoln Park to a crowd of 5,000 Italian Americans.\\"Italians Pay Tribute to Garibaldi.\\" Chicago Tribune. Monday May 11, 1936. page 3. By 1920, 50% of Chicago Heights was ethnic Italian. Most of the Chicago Heights Italians originated from Amaseno, Lazio; Caccamo, Sicily; Castel di Sangro; and San Benedetto del Tronto, Marche. Blue Island also had an Italian settlement. The men originated from Ripacandida, Basilicata and were railroad workers. Institutions In 1907, the Italian-American Chamber of Commerce, an organization promoting US- Italy trade, opened. Historical clubs included the Amasenese Society, the Maroons Soccer Club, and the Mazzini-Verdi Society. Vecoli wrote that Chicago has 150 Italian organizations. In 1945, the Italian Welfare Council opened, providing recreational, educational, and social services. In 1952, it was replaced by the Italian American Civic Committee, an umbrella organization which sponsors the annual Columbus Day parade. Media Beginning in 1960, the newspaper Fra Noi was published. By the 1950s/1960s, Italian television and radio programs were available. In previous eras, there were radio programs available for the Italians, with around twelve in the Italian language. Politics In Chicago, ethnic Italians have been Chicago aldermen, suburban mayors, county judges, and legislators in the Illinois government. Italian politicians have been elected in Blue Island, Chicago Heights, Elmwood Park, Evergreen Park, Highwood and Melrose Park. Dominic Candeloro stated that, in the City of Chicago, few Italians have been elected to major offices because \\"The number of Italians in the larger electoral units has never been great enough to challenge successfully other ethnic groups, and the Mafia image has made it difficult for Italian politicians in larger districts\\" Candeloro added, \\"There has never been even a serious Italian candidate for mayor of Chicago.\\" Jerome Cosentino, an ethnic Italian from Chicago, was elected Illinois State Treasurer, becoming the first to hold a statewide office in Illinois. Italian Chicago native Ralph C. Capparelli was a member of the Illinois House of Representatives and served for 33 years (13th and 16th District) from 1971–2004. In 1996, Al Salvi ran for one of Illinois' US Senate seats, but lost. Religion The Italian community was and still is largely Catholic. Vecoli wrote that \\"A few Italian inner-city parishes remain, but most were either dissolved or turned over to incoming groups.\\" This was a result in many moving out to the suburbs and the influx of Catholics from other ethnicities. The Church of the Assumption opened in the first Italian neighborhood in 1881. It was the first Italian Catholic church in Chicago. The Scalabrian Church of Santa Maria Incoronata served Italians living in what is now Chinatown. In the 1980s, the church became a mission of the St. Theresa Church as a way to serve Chinese people. Dominic Candeloro wrote that once the church changed into being a mission, it was no longer the \\"focal center\\" of the Italian community there. The religious institutions in the West Side of Chicago serving Italians included a hospital (founded by Mother Cabrini) and the Our Lady of Pompeii and Holy Guardian Angel Churches. The community at 69th and Hermitage attended the St. Mary of St. Carmel Church. The Italians in Pullman and Roseland attended the Scalabrian Church of St. Anthony of Padua. The local church in Chicago Heights was San Rocco, which opened in 1906 and was closed by Archbishop of Chicago Cardinal Joseph Bernardin in 1990. The Blue Island Italian settlement was served by the church of San Donatus. Italian religious street festivals have long occurred in Chicago and, as of the 1990s, several still continued. The Missionaries of St. Charles Borromeo (Scalabrini Fathers) had several institutions in the western suburbs. The order operated institutions for ethnic and religious purposes. The order operated the Italian Cultural Center at Casa Italia, located in Stone Park,\\"Home.\\" Casa Italia Italian Cultural Center Chicago.

DMK is noted for crudely emulating the sounds of Depeche Mode using an old keyboard and various toys and household items as instruments. The band became an internet sensation in January, 2012, following the release of their third cover video, \\"Everything Counts.\\" Since their viral success, DMK have been invited to perform in front of live audiences in Colombia, the United States, Spain, Poland and Germany. DMK have been nominated for “Favorite Web Personality” at the 2015 Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards Colombia, featured in MTV Iggy's \\"10 Colombian bands on the rise\\" article, and in Ultimate Guitar´s list of 10 weirdest cover bands, and their remake of “Everything Counts” has been noted by The Atlantic as one of the most transformative cover songs and by Electronic Beats as one of the ten best Depeche Mode covers ever made. DMK are featured in the film Spirits in the Forest, directed by Anton Corbijn. History =Formation (2010–2012)= Dicken Schrader had been a Depeche Mode fan since he first heard them in 1987, as he was studying high school in Bogotá. In late 2010, as he was going through the separation from his first wife and the mother of Milah and Korben, he decided to recreate their 1985 classic “Shake The Disease” as an act of psychomagic because he felt a connection with its lyrics at that point in his life. To create his cover version of the song, Schrader used an old Yamaha PSR-150 keyboard that was given to him by his mother, a xylophone a kazoo and several bottles, cans, tambourines, and toys. He invited Milah (then 7) and Korben (then 4) to perform some of the sounds present in the song. In the video they recorded at home and uploaded to YouTube, the screen is split in four sections and Schrader appears to play all instruments simultaneously with both hands and feet. Actually, the screen sections were recorded separately. The video was seen by family and friends, and as the three of them enjoyed the experience, they decided to create a second Depeche Mode cover in the same style as the first, “Strangelove” in mid-2011, in which the participation of both kids became more musically challenging. Since the children could not read sheet music, Schrader devised a color-coded system to label the instruments and write down the notes for the kids to learn. =Everything Counts (2012)= DMK performing “Everything Counts” on their viral YouTube video from 2012 On December 23, 2011, the trio uploaded a third Depeche Mode cover, this time for the song “Everything Counts,” expecting it to be seen by the small group of family and friends who enjoyed the previous two. But in late January, 2012, the video was suddenly picked up by news outlets and blogs around the world, like CBS, HuffPost, Wired magazine and The Guardian, quickly becoming viral, making the trio an internet sensation almost overnight. In February 2012, the band adopted the name DMK, which stands for “Depeche Mode Kids” but also refers to the initials of the band members’ names. =Artistic Growth (2012–2018)= After the release of \\"Everything Counts\\" the band released two more Depeche Mode covers in the same four-screen format: \\"Black Celebration,\\" released in June, 2012, and \\"Enjoy The Silence\\", released in December, 2012. Then, in May, 2013, they released \\"Just Can't Get Enough\\", as a live version especially recorded in the streets of La Candelaria, Bogotá, for the BAS 2013 festival in Basildon, UK. Since their online popularity exploded they have been invited to perform in front of live audiences, first in local events like the Festival Tecnológico Texun 2012 in Medellín and the Fantástico! Festival Internacional de las Artes 2013 in Barranquilla, and then festivals outside Colombia, like the Échale Latino Music Estyles festival in San Antonio, Texas, on May 9, 2014, and the ¡Pachanga! Latino Music Festival in Austin, Texas, on May 10, 2014. They also headlined Sónar Kids in El Port de la Selva, Catalonia, on May 24 and 25, 2014, where they performed in front of a crowd of over 5000 people. On December, 2014, DMK released their seventh cover video, \\"But Not Tonight,\\" their first professionally made music video, recorded in a studio in Bogotá and inspired in Depeche Mode imagery and Antoine de Saint-Exupéry’s novella “The Little Prince”. On March 13, 2015, DMK opened the second day of Festival Estéreo Picnic in their hometown of Bogotá. The show was a success despite the fact that Korben broke his right elbow two days before the festival and had to play only with his left hand. On May 2015, after 5 years of recording Depeche Mode covers, DMK released their first original composition entitled \\"Pale Blue Dot,\\" a homage to the famous photograph taken by the Voyager 1 space probe and, incidentally, by Carl Sagan's thoughts about it expressed on his book by the same name. They also announced that the kids would move with their mother to Miami, Florida, but that this separation would not break up the band. In 2016 DMK were invited to perform at the Tauron Nowa Muzyka festival in Katowice, Poland, gathering one of the largest and most enthusiastic audiences in their career. On March 20, 2017, they were chosen to take over Depeche Mode's Facebook page as part of the Takeover campaign, becoming one of Martin Gore's favorite entries, who publicly expressed it in a video posted on Depeche Mode’s Facebook page. DMK released on YouTube their first 360° video, recorded in their Bogotá home, for the 1982 classic “The Meaning of Love” on October, 2017, followed by a similarly-recorded video for Personal Jesus on early 2018. On March 16, 2018, two of the band members, Dicken and Korben, were finally able to meet Depeche Mode at a meet-and-greet in Bogotá during their Global Spirit Tour. =Spirits in the Forest (2018-2019)= On November 21, 2019, Spirits in the Forest was released in theaters worldwide, featuring the stories of six life-long Depeche Mode fans, including Dicken Schrader and DMK. Sources vary on the total gross of the movie's one-night release, with one claiming about US $2.5m while another claims US $4.5m.

He is the son of Siward, general of the English forces in the battle against Macbeth. Macbeth kills him in the final battle, shortly before his swordfight with Lord Macduff. He is based on the real-life historical figure of Osbeorn Bulax. Role in the Play He first appears in scene 5.2, as the English forces join with the Scottish. Lennox refers to him as one of many “unrough youths” who “protest their first of manhood.” If he is an “unrough” youth, then he is too young to grow a beard and is probably around fifteen or sixteen. Also, to protest “his first of manhood” means that he is eager to prove himself as a man. He next appears in scenes 5.4 and 5.6 as the troops enter Birnam Wood and Malcolm orders him and his father to lead the first battalion against Macbeth. His final appearance occurs in scene 5.7 when he comes across Macbeth and attacks, calling him “an abhorred tyrant.” Macbeth slays him and exits the stage. In the final scene of the play, Ross informs Siward of his son’s death, saying “like a man he died.” Siward expresses his gratitude that his son died honorably, and says he is sure that his son has become a soldier of God. Significance In his article about the death of Young Siward, Karl F. Zender writes: In this sense, the battle between Macbeth and Young Siward serves two purposes. Young Siward is offering himself as champion of Christian good against the forces of darkness, and for Macbeth, his triumph over the boy is proof of his (mistaken) belief that no human can kill him. Young Siward's Christian beliefs are echoed when his father hears of his death and is assured that his son has become \\"God’s soldier\\" because of his battle against evil. Although he falls in battle, Young Siward is praised for his bravery, and in falling at the hand of Macbeth he has finally achieved manhood (this is indicated when Ross informs Siward that his son \\"only liv'd but till he was a man\\"). However the Young Siward does show blatant cracks in the character of Malcolme - \\\\- when Malcolme was confronted by 'Norweyans' he ran while others fought against his captivity (The Tragedy of Macbeth I.ii). \\\\- if run down by the 'Norweyans', his hurts would have been on the back. God's Soldiers only have their hurts on the front (The Tragedy of Macbeth V.viii). \\\\- Young Siward, with his uncle, leads the first assault while Malcolme remains (The Tragedy of Macbeth V.vi).

The project is under the patronage of the Government of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and its secretariat is based at the Munsbach Castle. History =Beginning= Campus Europae was initiated by a group of German experts in Higher Education chaired by Dr. Konrad Schily, former President of the Witten/Herdecke University, and Prof. Meinolf Dierkes, former President of the Social Science Research Center Berlin, to whom the former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl had asked in 1998 to develop a concept for an educational initiative that was supposed to be launched during the German presidency of the European Union in 1999. As the Kosovo War occupied the interests of the European leaders, the project was postponed until 2001, when the former Prime Minister of Luxembourg Jean-Claude Juncker took over the initiative, added this project to his task-list for the next government period (in French) and invited European ministers of Higher Education and universities to engage in this mobility project. Between 1998 and 2003 Campus Europae was funded by resources of the Quandt Foundation, the Allianz Kulturstiftung, the Volkswagen Foundation and a grant by the media entrepreneur, Leo Kirch. =Establishment= At the end of 2003 the Rectors’ Council elected the first president and secretary general, respectively Prof. Noel Whelan and Prof. Christoph Ehmann. Shortly after, in 2004, the first experimental student exchanges took place and a new secretariat was put in place. Also in 2004 the Campus Europae Student Council (now Club d’Europe) was created, consisting of student representatives from each member universities. It has since played an integral role in the Campus Europae network. In 2005, Campus Europae started developing the concept of studying and working abroad and also organized an International Conference about the Social Dimension of the Bologna Process, under the Luxembourg Presidency of the European Union. The following year Campus Europae and the European Investment Bank started investigating the possibility of establishing a pan-European loan system for student mobility and in 2007 the former EU Commissioner Ján Figeľ labeled Campus Europae as “Erasmus +”, during a conference at the European Parliament. This name was later adopted for the EU programme for Education, Training, Youth and Sport 2014–2020. =Foundation= In 2008, the umbrella organization of network was formally established as European University Foundation – Campus Europae, to which degree-awarding powers were bestowed upon in the same year. In 2009, the Campus Europae online language-learning portal was launched and in 2010 the online database of ex-ante equivalences made available to its exchange students, while the Rectors appointed Prof. Estela Pereira as mobility Ombudswoman. In 2011, the Luxembourg Forum and \\"Ride for Your Rights!\\" initiatives were launched while in the following year the first 1000 CE exchange students milestone was reached; additionally, the first two Campus Europae Summer Schools took place, while in 2013 the new Erasmus+ Programme embraced one of the founding notions of Campus Europae – that students should be able to study abroad more than once during their academic careers \\"Kerklaan, Vincent, Gillian Moreira, and Kees Boersma. \\"The Role of Language in the Internationalisation of Higher Education: an example from Portugal.\\" \\\\- also echoing the need for a greater emphasis on language learning and academic recognition. Student Mobility The chief objective of the Campus Europae project is to foster the notion of Europe's ‘unity in diversity’ and contribute to the development of a shared sense of European identity.(in French) Its exchange students are afforded opportunities to develop a comprehensive understanding of learning and working cultures in various European regions.(in German) The pillars of student exchange in Campus Europae are: =Length of mobility period= Students exchanged under the aegis of Campus Europae go abroad for a full academic year. This is a cornerstone of the program because exchanges that last only one academic semester afford much less contact with the host society, limiting the potential for cultural learning. Furthermore, Campus Europae students are encouraged to spend two academic years abroad in two different countries where different languages are spoken. =Recognition of studies= The network aims at ensuring that all the students it exchanges receive full recognition of their studies abroad. This is rendered possible by the work of the Subject Committees, which regularly convene faculty representatives across the network, who in turn devise mobility pathways for their students. =Language Learning= Campus Europae advocates mobility with a strong emphasis on cultural understanding and multilingualism. Accordingly, the network offers its students support in learning the language of the host country at least up to the B1 level (of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages). =CE Degree= Students who have studied abroad with Campus Europae for two full academic years, earned (at least) a B1 certificate in the languages of their host institutions and had a minimum 45 ECTS (per mobility period) recognized upon return are eligible for a Campus Europae Degree, which is awarded under Luxembourg Law, along with their own graduate diploma. =Study related part-time internships= Students are encouraged to combine their studies abroad with a study related internship. This combination of studying and working enhances the learning experience and the linguistic and cultural immersion as well as the professional networking. =Additional support= Professors from various faculties, administrative staff and student representatives of all member universities work together within the framework of the network to provide exchange students with support and information, which range from the living costs of the various university cities to pocket guides and others. Laboratory for mobility Since its inception, Campus Europae had a strong emphasis on policy innovation and pioneering solutions for mobility,(in French) some of which were eventually incorporated in successive generations of the Erasmus Programme. =Academic recognition= Campus Europae developed the concept of Ex-ante recognition (in which equivalences are established prior to the exchange of students as part of the preparatory works among partner universities) and established Europe’s largest database of such equivalences.http://paperjam.lu/news/la-mobilite-des-talents- arme-anti-chomage In addition to being a resource for students who need to prepare a Learning Agreement for a study year abroad, the member Universities are also experimenting with leveraging on this work to easily embed mobility in their curricula through mobility windows and double degree arrangements. =Online language learning= Campus Europae developed an online language learning portal from 2007 http://www.tfzr.uns.ac.rs/casopis- itro/files/Casopis%20ITRO2011.pdf Dražić, Jasmina, Ljiljana Subotić, and Isidora Bjelaković. \\"FOREIGN LANGUAGE LEARNING WITHIN HOOK UP! PROJECT.\\" Volume 1, Number1, December 2011.: 74. onwards, with the support of the European Commission. Through a blended learning strategy exchange students are able to start learning the language of the host country online prior to departure, and this process is then continued through intensive and semester courses. The European Commission is promoting a similar approach from 2014 onwards.http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/documents/erasmus-plus- programme-guide_en.pdf , page 13, \\"Multilingualism\\" =Studying and working / social dimension= The development of the study-related part-time placements in Campus Europae started in 2005 and stemmed from the findings of the Eurostudent report, where it was noted that almost 50% of the European students work while they study, which in turn renders them more likely to be structurally excluded from traditional exchange schemes. Club d'Europe The Club d'Europe is the student organization of Campus Europae, established alongside the network and is represented in all organs of the Foundation. It plays an important role in providing feedback about the functioning of the program, monitoring the exchanges organized under the aegis of the network and helping disseminate the opportunities available in each member university. =\\"Ride for your Rights!\\"= In 2011, the project \\"Ride for your Rights! - It's time to (ex)change your life\\" was launched by the Campus Europae Student Council (predecessor of the Club d'Europe) as a way to publicly promote the values of Campus Europae and highlight the shortcoming of existing student exchange programs. The core concept was a bicycle tour open to the public, combined with events ranging from conferences to visits to historical landmarks across Europe. The project was organized in cooperation with the Erasmus Student Network and other organizations. It is considered the flagship project of the Club d'Europe. 2011 edition The first edition of \\"Ride for your Rights!\\" consisted of a bicycle tour from Novi Sad (Serbia) to Saint Petersburg (Russia) to promote the \\"Manifesto for more support and less obstacles for student mobility\\". More than 100 cyclists took part in different stages of the tour, with dozens of organizations supporting the initiative.http://derstandard.at/1308680122941/Blog-Ride-for-your- Rights-4000-Kilometer-fuer-mobiles-Studieren (in German)http://www.poranny.pl/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20110809/BIALYSTOK/468839084 (in Polish)http://www.poranny.pl/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20110810/BIALYSTOK/81431013 (in Polish)http://www.15min.lt/naujiena/aktualu/lietuva/po-europa-minantys- dviratininkai-atvyko-i-kauna-56-165623 (in Lithuanian)http://yle.fi/uutiset/jarjesto_polkenut_4_000_kilometria_vaihto- opiskelun_puolesta/2852092 (in Finnish) The project was the Austrian nominee to the European Charlemagne Youth Prize and carried out under the auspices of the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe. 2012 edition The second edition of \\"Ride for your Rights!\\" celebrated the 25th anniversary of the Erasmus Programme with a bicycle tour from Luxembourg to Brussels.

The bicycle tour began in Vienna (Austria) and ended in Ankara (Turkey) The project was, once again, the Austrian nominee to the European Charlemagne Youth Prize Supporters The project was publicly supported by several European personalities, including MEPs Jerzy Buzek, Martin Schulz, Doris Pack, Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaitė and Olympic BMX Champion Māris Štrombergs. Luxembourg Forum on Human Rights and Higher Education The Luxembourg Forum is an international conference aimed at facilitating a reflection on the capacity and responsibility of European Universities to uphold Human Rights within and beyond academia. The Forum is a joint initiative of Campus Europae, the UNESCO Chair on Human Rights at the University of Luxembourg and the Luxembourg Government. The initiative is under the patronage of the Council of Europe. The Luxembourg Forum was first held in 2011, while a second edition took place in 2013.

History African American farmers settled there in approximately the 1870s, including Louis Stark who established a pre-emption in 1873. In 1884, Jonathan and Elizabeth Bramley and several of their adult children moved to the area and established a farm called Rothwell Ranch. The area remained sparsely populated until coal mines started operation in 1897. The first coal was shipped in 1899. A post office was opened in 1900 with the name \\"Extension\\" in reference to the Wellington Extension of the collieries at Wellington, 13 km away. Owned by the Wellington Colliery Company, one of the area's main coal companies, this was originally called \\"Wellington Extension\\" until shortened to \\"Extension\\" when the post office was named.BC Names entry \\"Extension (community)\\" Extension was culturally diverse. In 1911, 132 Chinese Canadians worked at the coal mines, sawmill and as domestic servants in Extension and many of them lived in Chinatown. The largest coal mining accident in Extension's history occurred on October 5, 1909 when thirty-two workers were killed in an explosion, which left thirteen women without husbands and thirty-eight children without fathers. Extension was involved in the Great Vancouver Island Coal Miner Strike from 1912-1914. The strike erupted into rioting in Extension and Ladysmith in August 1913 and resulted in fire damage and vandalism to equipment owned by Canadian Collieries (Dunsmuir) Ltd. Residences and businesses owned by strike breakers were also vandalized and, in some cases, burned to the ground by rioters.

In the , Machans Beach had a population of 1,051 people.  Geography  Gundy Anton Bridge from Machans Beach over Redden Creek to Redden Island, 2018 The Barron River and Barr Creek are respectively the southern and northern boundaries of the suburb, while the Coral Sea and Captain Cook Highway form the eastern and western boundaries. Looking upstream on Redden Creek (offshoot of the Barron River), 2018 The land is flat and just above sea level. The residential development is in the east of the suburb near the coast. The north-eastern coastline is a rocky sea wall, but the south- eastern coastline has a sand beach with the two sections separated by Redden Creek, which flows from the Barron River as a second mouth on the Coral Sea, creating an area known as Redden Island. The Gundy Anton Bridge crosses Redden Creek to connect the mainland part of Machans Beach with Redden Island. Redden Island is an important habit and feeding ground for shorebirds with over 100 species of bird being recorded there, including some rare and endangered species such as the eastern curlew, the great knot, the curlew sandpiper, the bar-tailed godwit, the red knot, and the lesser sand plover. These migratory shorebirds travel up to 25,000 km each year on their migration between Australian and Asia, some travelling as far north as Siberia and Japan. The majority of the suburb is still used as freehold farming land with sugarcane the predominant crop. History Looking south along the esplanade, 2018 The Yirrganydji people traditionally inhabited the area. They used dugouts (single outrigger canoes) for fishing. From the canoes they used spears to catch smaller fish and harpoons to catch large sea creatures such as dugong and turtle. In sheltered creeks, the Yirrganydji people established fish traps, fences of lawyer vine and bushes spread across the creek held in position in the creek by a series of stakes. The women would drive the fish into the traps by beating on the water. Some men pulled on the sides of the fish trap to hold it tight while other men speared the fish driven into the trap. According to traditional lore, if a sea snake was caught, it had to be released or else there would be huge storms. Older homes, 2018 The area was first surveyed in 1885, but was not permanently settled until the 1920s. It is named after Richard Machan who was among the first permanent white settlers in the area, having purchased land in the 1920s. Using a Model T Ford, Richard Machan provided transportation services to the area. He built a jetty to encourage tourist boats from Cairns to call at nearby Barron Beach. New homes on Redden Island, 2018 Machans Beach State School opened on 4 February 1952. In 1961, Gundy Anton donated part of his land for use in constructing a bridge across Redden Creek to Redden Island. In 2006, the council approved a local community proposal that the bridge (then known as the Redden Island Bridge) be renamed the Gundy Anton Bridge to reflect both the donation of the land and the considerable community service performed by Anton over the years. Machans Beach was gazetted as a suburb in 2002, having previously been a locality. At the the suburb recorded a population of 941. Looking south along the sea wall, 2018 The coastline and waterways in the area are unstable due to storm surge and flooding, which have changed the course of the Barron River over the years. From April 2014 to August 2015, the crumbling seawall along the suburb's northern coastline was rebuilt combined with the construction of a causeway further out to sea to provide greater protection for the growing number of residences along the coastal area following a number of severe storms. The project cost the Cairns Regional Council $16.8M. The drawback of the seawall is that it prevents a sandy beach from forming. Relationship to airport Machans Beach is located about 1–2 km north of the Cairns International Airport. Plans to extend the airport in 2011 raised a number of objections from Machans Beach residents in relation to environmental concerns and noise concerns.

Originally broadcast on 12 August 1959 in Sydney on ABN-2, a kinescope recording was made of the program and shown in Melbourne on ABV-2 on 2 September 1959. At the time, most live plays broadcast on Australian television were simply performances of overseas plays.

It stars Matheus Nachtergaele, Jonas Bloch, Dira Paes, Chico Díaz, and Leona Cavalli as working-class people who engage in amorous and social encounters, with most of the action taking place in a hotel and a bar. The directorial debut of Assis, the film was partially inspired by his previous short film Texas Hotel. It was filmed on a low budget in the suburbs of Pernambuco. Mango Yellow received several awards at various film festivals, both in Brazil and abroad, including Festival de Brasília and the Berlin Film Festival. The film was generally praised by domestic reviewers for its characters, soundtrack, cinematography, and depictions of Brazil. Brazilian Film Critics Association selected it as one of the best Brazilian films of all time, while English- speaking critics were more mixed in their response. Plot The film opens with Lígia, a barmaid who is fed up with her grueling routine and who is forced to routinely turn down the sexual propositions of the bar's customers. One of the men who hits on Lígia is Isaac, a necrophiliac who enjoys sodomizing corpses and drinking their blood. He lives at the Texas Hotel, where Dunga, a gay man, works as a handyman. Dunga is attracted to Wellington, a butcher who delivers meat to the hotel. Wellington, however, is married to Kika, a woman who is proud to be an evangelical Christian. However, Wellington cheats on his wife with a woman named Dayse. Dayse tires of being Wellington's mistress and tells Dunga about the relationship. Dunga anonymously reveals to Kika that her husband is cheating on her, thinking that if he can destroy their marriage, then he and Wellington can become lovers. Kika finds Wellington and Dayse together, attacks them, and then leaves for good. Wellington goes to the Texas Hotel to seek solace. Dunga wants to take Wellington up to his room, but Wellington is put off by the funeral of the recently deceased owner of the hotel. Meanwhile, Isaac is thrown out of the bar after trying to forcibly grab Lígia. He is then seen driving his car and when he meets Kika, he takes her to his apartment and they have sex. As the film concludes, Lígia is shown again complaining about her routine. This is followed by a montage of everyday city life, ending with Kika deciding to dye her hair in mango yellow, the same shade that made Isaac so attracted to Lígia. Cast *Matheus Nachtergaele as Dunga *Jonas Bloch as Isaac *Dira Paes as Kika *Chico Díaz as Wellington *Leona Cavalli as Lígia *Conceição Camarotti as Aurora *Cosme Prezado Soares as Bianor *Everaldo Pontes as Rabecão *Magdale Alves as Dayse (or Daisy) *Jones Melo as priest Themes Bloch's character is an example of how Assis tried to make the film \\"poetic and violent at the same time.\\" Writing for The New York Times, Stephen Holden interpreted the film's message as follows: \\"This is how the lower half lives in Brazil, and by extension, humanity at its most basic, getting along without the rose-colored protections that affluence affords.\\" As it deals with these kinds of themes, the film was labeled as \\"violent\\". In response, Assis said that he \\"films life as it is\\". Jose Solis of PopMatters declared that \\"despite its sorrowful appearance, the film is a celebration of life\\". Assis tried to contrast the violence depicted by the Hollywood action films with the \\"small violences\\" which people face everyday, making it \\"poetic and violent at the same time\\". Bloch's character shooting corpses represents \\"a harmless, symbolic addiction\\" in the same way other aspects of the film \\"come from it, this violence within us\\". Writing in The New Yorker, Michael Sragow said that \\"The human content ... is the stuff of art-house exploitation.\\" IstoÉ Gentes Domingas Person wrote that the phrase \\"the human being is stomach and sex\\", which is said by the priest in the film, is an apt summary of the film's \\"spirit\\". Writing in Diário de Pernambuco, Luciana Veras declared that the film \\"talk[s] about the excluded [people] who also crave the same as the characters in the [tele]novela[s], from Hollywood films or French novels: love and happiness\\". Assis criticized the fact that several directors like to \\"glamorize poverty,\\" and as such, he characterized his characters to show the people's vice. José Geraldo Couto of Folha de S. Paulo wrote that the film shows that \\"the miserable are not dear waiting for the mercy of others, but are full of life, willing to kill or die to fulfill their desires and instincts\\". Deborah Young of Variety opined that the mango yellow color represents both \\"the jaundiced shade of their broken dreams\\" and their sense \\"of nonconformity and feeling alive.\\" Background and production One of Assis's first ideas for the film led to a scene in which Cavalli (pictured) appears nude. Prior to Mango Yellow, Cláudio Assis worked as a production director on the 1996 film Perfumed Ball and as director on three short films. One of them, Texas Hotel, served as an inspiration to Mango Yellow; Alessandro Giannini of O Estado de S. Paulo said Texas Hotel is \\"a kind of 'privileged test' of Mango Yellow\\", while TV Guides Ken Fox described Mango Yellow as an \\"expanded version\\" of Hotel Texas. Couto wrote that the \\"gratuitous series of aberrations\\" presented in Texas Hotel was turned into an \\"articulate narrative and full of meaning\\". The production cost was R$450,000. Assis was happy with this, noting that Brazilian films cost an average of R$3 million at the time. The filming took place in the suburbs of the cities of Recife and Olinda, both in the state of Pernambuco. It was shot with 35 mm cameras brought from São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, and filming took place in five weeks between September and October 2001. One of the first ideas Assis had for the film was to show the mons pubis of a waitress he knew. Though he was unsure how to include this element, the yellow-colored pubic hair matched the book Tempo Amarelo (\\"Yellow Time\\"), by sociologist Renato Carneiro Campos. The title of the film was borrowed from the book, in which the author describes the \\"rotten teeth of children, the color of poverty in the country\\". Assis wanted to create a film to show \\"the face of the Brazilian people. We are from the Third World and we need to look at ourselves\\". Release Mango Yellows premiere was held at the Festival do Rio on October 4, 2002, while it was released on domestic theaters on August 15, 2003. Despite receiving praise by film critics, it was moderately received by Brazilian audiences. Mango Yellow grossed R$769,750, with a viewership of 129,021 people in the sixteen Brazilian theaters in which it was shown, representing the twelfth largest audience for a domestic film in 2003. =Accolades= At the 35th Festival de Brasília, Mango Yellow was selected as Best Film by the official jury, the popular jury, and critics alike; it also received the awards for Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Cast, and Best Actor (Díaz). Assis won the award for Best Debut Film at the 25th Havana Film Festival, where the film also won the award for Best Cinematography. It also won for Best Cinematography at the Seventh Brazilian Film Festival of Miami. Mango Yellow won in every feature film category at the 13th Cine Ceará—Best Film, Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Screenplay, Best Art Direction, Best Original Score, Best Actor (for Nachtergaele), and Best Actress (for Paes)—and also received a special prize for its costume design. Although nominated in 13 categories at the 2004 Grande Prêmio do Cinema Brasileiro, it only won for Best Cinematography. At the 53rd Berlin International Film Festival, it won the award for Best Film in the Forum section, and received the Grand Prix at the 15th Toulouse Latin America Film Festival. It was also nominated for the Ariel Award for Best Ibero-American Film. =Critical reception= The film received generally positive reviews in Brazil. The characters, the actor performances, and the soundtrack were praised by Person and Veras, with Veras noting that the film's characterizations avoided stereotypes. The film's cinematography was praised by Person and Veras as well as by Marcelo Hessel from Omelete and Alcino Leite Netto from Folha de S. Paulo, with Netto appreciating that the imagery was neither \\"decorative\\" nor \\"spare\\", but a part of the film. The film's depiction of real life in Brazil was praised by Hessel and Veras, with both of them commenting that City of God is \\"cosmeticized\\" if compared to Mango Yellow, and the Hessel stating that Mango Yellow is \\"a testimony of documentary and sociological value\\". Cinepop critic Andrea Don declared it a film that viewers would either love or hate, concluding that \\"you will not leave the cinema's room the same as you entered\\". In 2015, it was recognized by the Brazilian Film Critics Association as the 86th best Brazilian film of all time on its Top 100. Deborah Young of Variety said that Nachtergaele (pictured) \\"is a standout\\" in the film. Mango Yellow received mixed reviews from English-speaking reviewers. On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 60% rating based on five reviews, with an average score of 5.6/10. On Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 based on reviews from critics, the film has a score of 40 (indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\") based on five reviews. A The Village Voice reviewer described the characters as \\"babbling caricatures\\" and the film as a \\"shallow Brazilian trifle\\". Young called Nachtergaele a \\"standout\\" as \\"He embodies the film's savage over-the-topness without flattening out as some of the other characters do.\\" Although praising its cinematography, Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club said it is \\"a film that has nothing to say\\". Sragow, Young, and Fox also praised cinematographer Carvalho's work; Fox said it is \\"[t]awdry stuff ... but it's glorious to look at\\". In Sragow's opinion, the penultimate scene—the montage—\\"boasts an eloquence that eclipses everything else in the movie\\". Holden found the characters to be \\"robust, full-dimensional people\\" and praised the film's \\"surreal flavor\\". Solis praised it, saying \\"the real pleasure\\" in the film is that Assis \\"doesn't recur to exploitation to make these people memorable\\". =Home media= The film was released on DVD in Brazil by Califórnia Filmes in 2004, while in the United States it was released by First Run Features in partnership with Global Film Initiative on the \\"Global Lens 2004/2003\\" series in 2005, and on \\"The Best of Global Lens: Brazil\\" in 2011.

The film had its world premiere on March 7, 2014 at South by Southwest and stars Chris Osborn and Samuel Davis. The story revolves around a group of friends hunted by something in the woods of East Texas. Following the darker psychological tone of Sánchez's previous film, Lovely Molly, the film returns to the creature-feature horror of Altered, also written by Jamie Nash.Moviepilot.com Plot Brothers Brian and Matt, Matt's girlfriend Dora, and their friends Todd and Elizabeth are on their way to the brothers' uncle Bob's cabin in east Texas for a camping trip. After stopping to buy some fireworks, they continue on their way as day turns to night. Matt hits something with the car and stops to investigate. The group later hears loud cries of an animal in pain off in the distance, but decide to move onward. After coming across a tree that has been knocked across the road, the group continues on foot and reaches the cabin, only to discover that it is worn down and dilapidated. After finding a wild pig in one of the bedrooms, the group decides to spend the night in the car, where Brian and Matt again hear the loud screaming noises. The next morning, Brian finds the front bumper on the passenger side of the car damaged; there is also some blood on the fender and a tuft of hair in the grille. Regardless, the group enjoys their day at the cabin, swimming in a nearby lake. During the excitement, Brian catches sight of a large, dark bipedal figure running along a nearby ridge, but the others brush it off as if it were nothing. Determined to get the creature on film, he sets up several GoPro cameras at various points around the cabin. That night, aggressive screams are heard coming from the woods, frightening the group. One of the exterior cameras reveals a large figure approaching the cabin and ascending the stairs onto the porch. The group is further frightened when whatever is outside begins banging on the walls and doors. When silence falls, Brian goes to a window to take a look outside. He turns on the night vision on his camera, and sees a large hairy creature looking back at him before it roars and disappears from view. The following morning, the group decides to leave. Upon reaching the car, they find it completely destroyed and quickly return to the cabin. Matt and Brian reveal that they did not tell Bob that they were using his cabin and that they stole the keys from him: nobody knows where the group is, and nobody will be coming to rescue them. Matt bikes out alone to an area of the woods that has cell reception so that he can call for help. Just as he gets through to Bob, he is attacked by the creature and the camera cuts to black. Back at the cabin, the others move the furniture to block the windows and doors. They uncover a trap door to the cabin's cellar, where Todd finds a hunting rifle and some ammo. At nightfall, the creature attacks the cabin and injures Elizabeth before Todd wounds it with the hunting rifle, causing it to flee. In the morning, it is revealed that Elizabeth has succumbed to her injuries and died. The doors and windows of the cabin have been smashed wide open, meaning that the cabin can no longer offer any shelter. The remaining three members of the group decide to walk back to civilization on foot. That night, they hear Matt screaming somewhere nearby. The screams are coming from a tunnel that the group assumes to be the creature's den. Brian goes in and rescues Matt, shooting the creature in the process. As dawn breaks, the group takes shelter in an abandoned trailer and Brian receives a call from Bob, who is now at the cabin. Todd heads out with the fireworks and sets them off in an attempt to alert Bob to their location, only to have the creature attack and kill him. The creature then pushes the trailer over the edge of a hill where it tumbles down with Brian, Matt, and Dora still inside. When Brian regains consciousness, he realizes that Matt has died in the fall and Dora has been fatally injured, dying seconds later. The creature jumps from the top of the hill down to where the trailer is. Brian flees out of a broken window and the creature gives chase. Brian comes to the edge of another hill and quickly jumps as the creature approaches. Upon his landing, he fakes dead as the creature quickly descends upon him, roaring in his face, pushing him back and forth and hitting the ground near his head. The creature then grabs his leg and drags him off. Sometime later, Brian jumps up gasping for air as it is revealed he is lying next to the bodies of Todd, Matt, Dora and Elizabeth. In his panic, he turns and sees a small dark figure lying in a shallow hole. Upon investigating, it is shown to be the corpse of a small bigfoot. The large bigfoot appears and knocks him into the hole, pushing his head closer and closer. Brian realizes that the child must have been what they hit the night they arrived at the cabin, and begins apologizing hysterically. Suddenly a shot is heard, and the creature flees as Bob calls out. He grabs Brian and they quickly flee, Brian apologizing for not listening to him. As they near Bob's truck, the bigfoot appears and tackles Bob to the ground, seemingly killing him. Brian picks up his uncle's gun and runs as the creature gives chase. He turns and points at the creature, begging it to stop. The creature stops a few feet away from him, breathing heavily as Brian continues to apologize for killing its young. Brian lays down the gun, turning around and sitting down with his back to the creature, saying to the camera that this is his final video while he waits for the creature to finish him off. The creature, after a while, just turns and disappears into the woods, leaving Brian alone as it begins to rain and he lays the camera down facing his uncle's truck, being perhaps the only survivor.

On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 22 out of 100, based on 22 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". In a particularly scathing review, Keith Uhlich from The A.V. Club wrote, \\"It feels strange to be so dismissive about someone who once commanded wide attention (however much as a fluke) with an indie blockbuster that effectively birthed a lucrative mainstream genre. But Sánchez, sadly, is now a pretender to his own throne.\\" Ed Gonzalez of Slant Magazine rated the film 1.5 out of 4 stars, panning the film's uninteresting characters, 'under-realized metaphorical ambitions', and thin story. Geoff Berkshire from Variety criticized the film's thin characters, and script, writing, \\"Eschewing the painfully slow-burning suspense and pseudo-realism that helped make Blair Witch a sleeper smash and genre touchstone, Sanchez’s thoroughly conventional approach here does little to elevate a dismally generic script\\". Robert Abele of the Los Angeles Times was highly critical of the film, calling it \\"aggressively unimaginative\\". Frank Scheck from The Hollywood Reporter similarly criticized the film's clichéd script, and thin characters, calling it \\"a compendium of horror movie clichés whose visual style is roughly akin to trying to watch a movie while riding in a rollercoaster.\\" The film was not without its supporters. Richard Wittaker of Fearnet praised Exists for its editing and score, as they felt that it would help make the movie appeal to people who would not normally like found footage films. The Austin Chronicle gave a predominantly positive review and commented that while the film held several similarities to Sánchez's The Blair Witch Project, \\"he evades all those bear traps, returning tension and pathos to the monster movie.\\" References External links  * Category:2014 films Category:2014 horror films Category:American natural horror films Category:American films Category:Found footage films Category:Horror adventure films Category:Bigfoot films Category:Lionsgate films ","title":"Exists (film)"},{"id":"42190367","text":"Bytom market square Market Square () is a central feature of the Śródmieście district in the city of Bytom, Poland.

In July 1942, the 26th Field Company of the Royal Australian Engineers was moved from Carss Park to Oatley Park. Several temporary structures were assembled to accommodate about 250 soldiers, including a mess tent, kitchen, shower blocks, an Aldershot oven, and storehouse. By January 1943, after only 6 months, most of these soldiers had joined the AIF for service in New Guinea so the 26th Field Company was disbanded. They were then replaced by the Tasmanian 12th Field Company, RAE, which was stationed there for 10 weeks. The concrete floor of a kitchen, ordinance store and shower block, some stone steps and a small concrete map of Tasmania can still be seen.History of Oatley Fauna and flora As one of Sydney's finest areas of natural bushland, Oatley Park is noted for its trees, shrubs and native flowers, as well as the river beaches and prolific bird life.Oatley Park Flora and Fauna brochures *Over 310 plant species have been recorded.

While its last iteration was publicly owned by the City of Houston, it was privately owned throughout the vast majority of its existence. Throughout several name changes and ownership acquisitions, the company's modes of operation ranged from mule-drawn streetcars to electrified streetcars, and finally to busses. In 1979, it was succeeded by the Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County, a state-authorized local transit authority, when it was purchased by that agency as the basis for its then new transit system. History =Original charter & horsecar operation= A mule-drawn streetcar operated by the Houston City Street Railway Company in the late 1870s. The company's origins can be traced back to 1870, when the company was chartered as the Houston City Street Railway Company with J.H. Scanlan as President. However, it was not until June 24, 1871 that the Houston City Council passed an ordinance that granted the company right-of-way. Despite the grant, it was not until 1874 that it began operations as a mule-driven streetcar company. The company's original line ran from Union Station that was operated by International–Great Northern Railroad to the Houston and Texas Central Station. In 1877, the company's assets included three miles of track, fourteen streetcars, and about one-hundred mules. =Electrified streetcar conversion, expansion, & reorganization= By 1890, the company owned fifty miles of track, fifty streetcars, and three-hundred horses. That year, the company and its sole competitor Bayou City Street Railway Company that had begun operation the year prior were acquired by Oscar Martin Carter, effectively merging the companies. Martin was president of the Omaha and South Texas Land Company, which had purchased the land to develop the Houston Heights. The first suburb of Houston was too far to walk, and thus control of the public transportation system in Houston was critical to making the community work. Thus, both Carter, and Omaha and South Texas Land Company's director Daniel Denton Cooley are credited with having founded the Heights. In 1891, the company began using electric streetcars based on technology invented by the Thomson-Houston Electric Company, and fully converted from mule-driven cars by the following year. The Houston City Street Railway Company was placed in receivership on March 1, 1894. The company was foreclosed upon and sold on May 6, 1896, then officially reorganized as the Houston Electric Street Railway Company on September 1, 1896. However, this format was short-lived. In July 1900, a committee was formed with a plan to reorganize again. The company was placed back in receivership on May 28, 1901. Under another foreclosure, it was reorganized as the Houston Electric Company on October 26, 1901, and purchased as a wholly owned subsidiary by the Boston-based engineering company Stone & Webster on November 1, 1901. It would retain this name and general direction for the next several decades. On July 5, 1903, the Houston Electric Company developed and opened a park named \\"Highland Park\\" to encourage ridership on its Houston Avenue line. The park property was leased to property managers who would then operate the facility. It was sold to the city to become a municipal park in 1911, and its name was changed to Woodland Park in 1914. Woodland Park is still in existence in Woodland Heights. =Introduction of buses & change of direction= A Houston Transit Company bus in 1956 In 1924, the first bus, used on Austin Street, was incorporated into the Houston Electric Street Company's system. By 1925, two more bus lines, one to the East End, were added. Over time, buses continued to replace the streetcar until June 1940 when the entire system was converted to bus service. In 1946, having discontinued electric streetcar service, the company appropriately changed their name from Houston Electric Company to Houston Transit Company. In 1961, Houston Transit Company was acquired by new owners and renamed Rapid Transit Lines. Rapid Transit Lines was acquired by National City Lines in 1966. In 1974, the City of Houston acquired Rapid Transit Lines from Houston Transit Company.

History Beaverton incorporated in 1893, and by 1914 had a volunteer fire department. To the south, Tualatin incorporated in 1913 and on February 2, 1935, formed the Tualatin Fire Department. Residents of unincorporated West Slope contracted with Beaverton’s fire department to have the latter provide service starting in 1941, but created their own West Slope Rural Fire Protection District in 1949. One of two stations in Wilsonville In 1946, the Tualatin department became the Tualatin Rural Fire Protection District and opened a new station on Boones Ferry Road, and in 1948 the Stafford- Wilsonville Fire Department merged into the new rural district. Also in 1946, the Cedar Mill Rural Fire Protection District was created, followed by the Beaverton Rural Fire Protection District in 1947 that covered the Aloha area. The Beaverton Rural district contracted with Beaverton for services, with the original station on 185th at Blanton across from the post office. A second station was opened in 1965 in the Progress area, with a third opening adjacent to Tektronix on Jenkins Road in 1967. Sherwood merged their fire department with Tualatin Rural in 1968. Municipal fire departments in Tigard and King City, and Sherwood later joined the Tualatin Rural Fire Protection District. In 1972, Washington County Fire District 1 was created with the merger of the Beaverton Rural, Cedar Mill Rural, and the West Slope Rural fire districts. Washington County Fire District 1 and the Tualatin Rural Fire Protection District began discussing a merger in 1985, and in November 1988 the two districts signed off on the plan with a preliminary name of as Consolidated Fire and Rescue District.

Training Center on Tonquin Road between Sherwood, Wilsonville, and Tualatin Prior to the merger, Washington County Fire District 1 signed an agreement with Hillsboro in 1987 in which TVF&R; would not oppose annexations by the city that would remove properties from the district. The agreement also could have led to a merger with the Hillsboro Fire Department. The next year the district and Hillsboro agreed to have WCFD1 continue providing service in the recently annexed Tanasbourne neighborhood for five years. In April 1989, the new district opened a training facility. Washington County Fire District 2 (WCFD2) started negotiations in October 1989 with TVF&R; for a partial merger, though the merger never occurred. At that time TVF&R; maintained WCFD2’s equipment, along with Hillsboro’s equipment. Multnomah County Fire Districts 4 and 20, plus the Valley View Water District, merged into TVF&R; in 1995.

He has been the patron saint of Nájera and Álava since the mid-17th century. His festival is on 28 April.  Life  He was born and lived in Armentia, a village in the municipality of Vitoria, Álava. When he became fifteen years old, he retired being an anchorite to the surroundings of the actual Soria city. He stayed there around seven years and after that he directed to Calahorra, where there were big headquarters. It is affirmed that he evangelized many people in Tarazona when he moved from Soria. Years passed and he was admitted like Tarazonas cathedral cleric, taking over the maintenance of the temple from its beginning, and becoming an archdeacon. After Tarazonas´ bishop death, Prudencio was proposed to be his substitute, achieving the job. As he performed some miraculous healings, he had much fame among sick people, so that is why he escaped from Tarazona and got back to Soria. As there were many disagreements in the bishopric and the cleric of Burgo de Osma, Prudencio was chosen to be the intermediary. After bringing them to an understanding, he contracted a mortal illness and died.  Contributions  San Saturio hermitage (Soria) was built where Prudencio was disciple of Saturio. Although there are many documents referring to San Prudencio, it is said that the breviary of Tarazena is the most certain one. It is not known exactly when he lived, inasmuch as there are many dates between the late 4th century and the late 6th century. If we take into account that Prudencio's master was born in 493, he would have been born in approximately the mid-6th century.  Death and grave  As he died in Burgo de Osma, out of his diocese. Being an illustrious person, his relics occasioned heated quarrels among the jurisdictions. The legend said that the problem was solved by putting the dead body on a horse he used when he was alive, letting it to be free. It stopped in Logroño and they sepultured him in a cave of the mountain called Laturce, the actual town of Clavijo (La Rioja). In the place his grave was at, a church called San Vicente de Mártir was built. According to the friar Gaspar Coronel, its name was changed to the monastery of San Prudencio in 1025. From the 12th century, Laturce mountain and Nájera had many debates because they did not know where to put Prudencio's relics. Finally they divided the objects in half and the own holy in 1040. Church of Armentia  Sanctification in Álava  In the middle of the 13th century, he was considered as a saint, firstly appeared in San Millán de la Cogolla's monastery cartulary, on 24 April 759, but Prudencio became the pattern of Álava on 18 November 1643 by the own province general meeting. On 5 November 1644 it was voted uniformly on his favor, being ratified in the council on 4 May 1645. In 1688 his own prayer was requested, further of some holidays and his own chapel, located in Armentia.

Kilometroak consists of walking down a circuit of 5-10 kilometers, one dotted with food stands and entertainment. Participants sometimes represent a certain organization, and the money collected is used to assist the Basque language schools in the province of Gipuzkoa. It also aims at raising Basque culture and language awareness, as well as highlighting community bonds. Each year a different town organizes the event. Parents, teachers and students volunteer and plan ahead to have everything arranged for the day of the festival, and contribute until it is over at dusk.  History and description Kilometroak 1989 in Oñati The festival is organized by the Ikastola Federation of the Basque Country on a yearly basis in different locations. It first took place on October 16, 1977 (Beasain-Lazkao) along the lines of Josu Ergüin's design, modeled after a similar Californian event. He was assisted in the design by J. Ramon Beloqui and Martin Ibarbia. When other Basque districts followed suit creating their own similar marches, the Kilometroak turned into a Gipuzkoa-specific festival. The participation consists of marching for a number of kilometers, paying a voluntary admission to the organization. The circuit features and showcases cultural and sport activities, farmer products, or entertainment shows, such as concerts, theater, or rural sports. The sponsors may be individuals, renowned personalities, or entities. Usually tens of thousands turn out, including personalities of Basque art, sports, politics and culture. The funds raised are managed by the Ikastola Federation, who destines a share to the Basque language schools lying on the area where the festival takes place.

It was first published in a hymn book in 1919.  History  The words of the hymn were initially written by St. Francis of Assisi in 1225 in the Canticle of the Sun poem, which was based on Psalm 148. The words were translated into English by William Draper, who at the time was rector of a Church of England parish church at Adel near Leeds. Draper paraphrased the words of the Canticle and set them to music. It is not known when Draper first wrote the hymn but it was between 1899 and 1919. Draper wrote it for his church's children's Whitsun festival celebrations and it was later published in 1919 in the Public School Hymn Book. The hymn is currently used in 179 different hymn books. The words written by St Francis are some of the oldest used in hymns after \\"Father We Praise Thee\\", written in 580 AD. Like \\"Ye Watchers and Ye Holy Ones\\", Draper's text is usually set to the tune of \\"'\\", a German Easter hymn published by Friedrich Spee in 1623 in his book '. This tune became widespread in English hymn books starting with a 1906 arrangement by Ralph Vaughan Williams.Anglican Hymn Book (1965). London: Oxford University Press. #251.The Hymnal 1982. The Episcopal Church. New York: Church Hymnal Corp. #400.New English Hymnal (1986). Norwich: Canterbury Press. #263 John Rutter also wrote a piece of music for the hymn. Despite the hymn being initially written by Draper for Whitsun (the Anglican and English designation for Pentecost), it is mostly used in the earlier weeks of the Easter season. Melody The most common melody is the 1623 German hymn tune '. The following setting is from the 1906 English Hymnal, with the lyrics quoted from the 1986 New English Hymnal: << << ew Staff { \\\\clef treble \\\\time 3/2 \\\\partial 2 \\\\key es \\\\major \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = \\"church organ\\" \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\override Score.BarNumber #'transparent = ##t \\\\relative c' << { es2^\\\\markup { \\\\italic \\"Unison.\\" }  es4 f g es g as  1 es,2  es4 f g es g as  1 \\\\bar\\"\\" es4^\\\\markup { \\\\italic \\"Harmony.\\" } d  c2 bes es4 d  c2 bes\\\\fermata \\\\breathe \\\\bar\\"\\" es2^\\\\markup { \\\\italic \\"Unison.\\" }  es4 bes bes as g as  1 es2  es4 bes bes as g as  bes1 \\\\bar\\"\\" as4^\\\\markup { \\\\italic \\"Harmony.\\" } g  f2 es as4 g  f2 es es'4 d  c2 bes es4^\\\\markup { \\\\italic \\"Unison.\\" } d  c2 bes as4 g  f1.  es1 \\\\bar\\".\\" }  { bes2  es1 es2  es2 d es  bes4 d es2 es2  es2 d bes'4 bes  bes( as) g2 es4 d  g( f) d2 bes'4 as  g2~ g4 f es2  es d es4 f  es2.  es4 d g f es4 es  es( d) es2 es4 es  es( d) c2 g'4 f  g( f) d2 ~  4 4~ c, es  es2 d1  bes }  { s2  s1.  s1.  s1.  s1 s2  s1.  s1.  s1.  s1 \\\\stemDown \\\\once \\\\override NoteColumn.force-hshift = 0 bes'2 } >> %necessary for that one note } ew Lyrics \\\\lyricmode { \\\\set stanza = #\\"1.\\"All2 crea4 -- tures of our God and King,1 Lift2 up4 your voice and with us sing1 Al4 -- le -- lu2 -- ya, al4 -- le -- lu2 -- ya!

Sib Pal Ki (literally \\"eighteen skills\\") is a Korean term for \\"martial arts\\", either Chinese martial arts or Korean martial arts (as opposed to the Japanese martial arts introduced during the Japanese rule in Korea). Kim Kwang-Seok had opened a martial arts school in 1969, having studied martial arts during the late 1950s to middle 1960s under Choi sang-chul, Korean [Kungfu master. In 1986 Korean folklorist Sim U-seong worked together with Kim Kwang-Seok to compare his style with the historical Muyedobotongji or \\"Comprehensive Illustrated Manual of Martial Arts\\" of 1790. In the same year, the first public performance of Sib Pal Gi took place at the Batanggol Small Theater in Seoul. In 2001, students of Kim Kwang Seok founded the Sib Pal Gi Preservation Society (십팔기 보존회), dedicated to staging public performances and disseminating public awareness of Korean martial arts in the South Korean public. It is not clear to which extent the Sib Pal Gi system taught by Kim Kwang-Seok corresponds to the historical 18th-century Korean systems and to which extent the system reflects more modern influence of Chinese martial arts; but the emphasis of Sib Pal Gi in Korea is that of being a \\"native\\" system in the sense of avoiding the modern Japanese martial arts which had become mainstream under the Japanese occupation of Korea during the first half of the 20th century. The term Sip Pal Gi (십팔기 \\"Eighteen Skills\\") in modern Korean martial arts has come to identify four separate activities. * there are practitioners in South Korea who follow the practices of an eclectic Chinese system of armed and unarmed Martial Arts termed Sip Pal Gi owing to the number of systems, methods and practices in its curriculum. Individual schools will vary in the weapons used and the manner of practice. *A second and more general application of the term is as a label to identify Chinese martial arts generically, much like \\"kung fu\\" has become an umbrella term for them in the West. *Also, there are small groups of practitioners who use the term Sip Pal Gi historically, for the attempted reconstruction of 18th-century Korean martial arts based on the historical manuals, specifically the Muyesinbo, much in the same way as martial arts reconstruction in the West. *Lastly, the style usually spelled Sipalki, of dubious relation with the Chosun period martial arts, taught by Yoo Soo Nam.

It was built from to 1922. It is also known as Inkerman Irrigation Area Power House. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 2 August 2004.  History  The Home Hill Powerhouse, a substantial brick and corrugated iron structure located in First Avenue, Home Hill, was completed in 1922 as part of the Inkerman Irrigation Area Scheme. At the time it was the largest powerhouse in North Queensland, supplying power for irrigation purposes to the farmers (mainly sugar cane growers) on the Inkerman Estate until 1953. The Inkerman Repurchased Estate, formerly part of Inkerman Station, was opened for selection on 8 December 1911, principally as sugar-growing land. Easy terms encouraged many people with little or no farming experience to take up blocks, and within a year, many of the 500 families who had settled at Inkerman had exhausted their limited capital and were heavily in debt. One drought convinced them that irrigation was essential, but few could afford to irrigate with individual pumping plants. In January 1913 the Inkerman Farmers and Graziers Association began lobbying the Queensland Government for the provision of a government- subsidised irrigation scheme for their district, modeled on the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Scheme in New South Wales, which utilised a central powerhouse to supply power to irrigation pumps on surrounding farms. In February 1913 the Assistant Engineer of the Water Supply Department, HEA Eklund, visited Ayr to report on the proposal. Eklund determined that there was adequate water beneath most Inkerman farms, and supported the idea of a communal irrigation scheme, which would be the first of its kind in North Queensland. Eklund calculated that a central powerhouse could serve 135 farms of an average size of . Although his initial estimate at was rejected as too costly, this was revised in 1915 to as more people settled in the area. However, the costs now were spread across more farms, Eklund estimating the cost of power at less than a penny per unit, far cheaper than the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area, which then was less than a sixth the size of that proposed for Home Hill. In May 1915 Queensland's first secure Labor government took office. Under the leadership of Premier T. J. Ryan and sponsoring a policy of State capitalism, the new Queensland Labor Government set about acquiring State enterprises. In July 1916 the Inkerman irrigation scheme was approved. The Inkerman Water Supply Board was constituted in February 1917 to manage and repay the capital cost over 28 years, the anticipated life of the plant. Detailed survey work was undertaken and by the end of the year, 100 well sites had been tested, 70 selected, and a contract for the manufacture of reinforced concrete casing let to Hume Brothers of Melbourne, with production commencing in late 1918. The cost of the scheme escalated due to inflation after First World War. Shortages and strikes following the war delayed the construction of the central powerhouse, the cost of which had risen by 150 percent. The cost of well sinking had nearly quadrupled, and the number of transmission lines had doubled. In 1921 a fresh estimate put the cost of the scheme at . On 15 May 1922 Premier Ted Theodore performed the official opening, although the main turbine was not yet completed. The powerhouse provided electricity to the town of Home Hill (surveyed in 1911 to service the Inkerman Repurchased Estate and developed from ), and to a few Inkerman farmers for irrigation purposes with the rest waiting to be connected. The central powerhouse could not drive all the pumps at once, and to prevent overload, power was provided in rotation, whilst at night there was hardly any load on the system. Under the Irrigation Act of 1922 control passed to the Irrigation and Water Supply Commission, which found many discrepancies between the book values and actual worth of many of the assets. All the dead and abandoned wells were written off, and the value of the powerhouse building halved as it was considered that a less elaborate structure would have served as well. , 478 was wiped off the capital assets giving a net worth of . By mid 1923 nearly had been spent yet only were irrigated. Inevitably, the half-complete scheme lost money. Although wartime conditions had contributed, the Water Supply Department had to share the blame; there had been no proper supervision to control well-sinking costs, and operating costs were high with a large powerhouse running at night just to power lights in Home Hill. 1931 was so dry that the powerhouse worked 24 hours per day from March to June. Farmers were rostered to maintain an even demand day and night. The installation of meters at last ensured that water and power were not wasted. For the first time the operation made a profit of nearly after paying interest, its first contribution to paying off the capital cost. The Moore Government, which replaced the Labor administration in 1929, sold most of the State Enterprises, and accepted the Inkerman farmers proposal to take over the district's power supply and irrigation scheme. The first meeting of the Inkerman Irrigation Board was held on 23 June 1932. The Board made farmers responsible for maintaining their own pumps, motors, wells and spear systems from 1 July 1932 and fixed the water rate at . Local management of the irrigation scheme increased confidence. The Board met the interest bill on the reduced capital as well as redemption on the loan, besides setting aside annually as required under the Water Act for renewals and extensions. By June 1935 it was comfortably in surplus. The supply of power to Home Hill increased year by year, and despite a reduction in charges, remained profitable. During the Second World War the rapid deployment of troops to North Queensland overtaxed the Townsville Power Station and new generating equipment was almost impossible to obtain. As its peak demand was at night, and Home Hill's by day, the Inkerman Irrigation Board agreed to supply electricity to Townsville. FA Rocketts and Son completed the Home Hill-Townsville link in July 1944. After technical problems were overcome, the first current was fed to Townsville on 5 August 1944. Home Hill's surplus power was insufficient, and an extra diesel plant was installed at Townsville, but the sale of power boosted the Irrigation Board's finances.Home Hill Power Station, ca. 1946The State Electricity Commission established a regional electricity board at Townsville in December 1945. A mass meeting of Inkerman Irrigation Board farmers in June 1946 endorsed the Townsville Regional Board's takeover proposal. Under an amendment to the Electric Light and Power Acts passed later that year, the powerhouse was sold as from 1 January 1947 for , less than the outstanding debt to Treasury. After a cash payment for coal and stores and sale of electric motors to farmers, the Irrigation Board paid half the difference and the rest was written off. By 1948, most of the power was flowing from Townsville to Home Hill, over 3 million units per annum, 14 times the flow in the opposite direction. Home Hill Powerhouse continued to operate 16 hours per day until the commissioning of the new Townsville generating station on 11 May 1953. Eight days later the Home Hill Powerhouse, whose whistle had blown every day at 8am, 12 noon, 1 pm and 5 pm, regulating local working hours, for 31 years, was decommissioned. In the mid-1960s rice growing emerged as an important new agricultural pursuit for the Burdekin. In 1969 the former Home Hill Powerhouse was officially opened by the Premier of Queensland, the Hon. Joh Bjelke-Petersen, as the Lower Burdekin Rice Producers Co-operative Association Ltd's rice mill. Considerable infrastructure for the rice milling process was developed round the former Power House. During this time the shed located on the northern side of the power house was removed and replaced by a single story corrugated iron skillion shed. Some internal partitioning and office walls of concrete block were constructed on the ground floor of the Power House building. The machinery and machinery foundations were removed from the machine shed which is located against the eastern facade of the three storey generator building. More recently the complex has housed agricultural chemicals for the sugar industry.  Description  The former Home Hill Powerhouse is a brick and corrugated iron structure situated on a large block in First Avenue, Home Hill. The surviving original powerhouse structure comprises two main elements: an administration area and the generator house. The administration area is a two-storeyed asymmetrical building constructed of brick on concrete foundations and has wings on both sides of a central round arch doorway. The building has a small frontispiece, which is painted green. The arch doorway is surmounted by a pediment decorated with the date of construction of the building, \\"A.D.1922\\" and the name of the present function of the building, \\"Pivot Service Centre\\". The doorway opens to an entrance hall and staircase, which leads to the first floor. The staircase is constructed of concrete with an iron handrail. The western wing has narrow brickwork columns dividing the facade into three bays. It supports a verandah on the ground and first floors. The ground floor has been partitioned into three rooms: a laboratory, storeroom and galley kitchen. The interior walls are rendered and are painted white. The first floor has been partitioned into two rooms with a timber-framed wall, which were bare of any fixtures and fittings and have a very simple interior. The ground floor of the eastern wing contains the main administration office of \\"Pivot Agriculture\\" and consists of one large room, which has been divided into offices and includes a reception area and front counter. The first floor of the eastern wing consists of one large room, now vacant, but recently used as offices. The interior has been modified with the inclusion of a false ceiling and timber panelling for office partitioning. The original timber windows have been replaced with aluminium windows. The former generator building is reached via a single doorway at the rear of the entrance hallway, with another doorway on the first floor also located at the rear of the entrance hallway. Access to the former generator building was limited to a narrow walkway that leads to the rear of the building. The former generator building is a three-storey structure with a concrete floor covering part of the first floor level. The building contains the remains of the power plant, including steel pipes, fans and fluming. Two large rice storage bins have been constructed at the first floor level. These bins are located on a platform supported by concrete piers. The bins are positioned on the northern side of the three-storey generator building. A newly constructed corrugated iron warehouse abuts the rear of the building. To the west of the powerhouse is a long corrugated iron clad building, possibly associated with the former use of the place as a rice factory.  Heritage listing  Home Hill Powerhouse was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 2 August 2004 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The former Home Hill Powerhouse is important in demonstrating the evolution of Queensland's history, in particular the pivotal role of irrigation in the development of the sugar industry in North Queensland. The former powerhouse provided electricity for pumping water for irrigation purposes, to early settlers on the Inkerman Repurchased Estate who otherwise would have been unable to grow sugarcane. The irrigation system demonstrates the pattern of state enterprises administered by Queensland's first functional Labor Government under the leadership of Premier TJ Ryan. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of its type: a substantial central powerhouse with brick office building and attached corrugated iron and brick generating building. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Home Hill Powerhouse has a special association with the Home Hill community as the provider of power for their irrigation system initially and later their shops and homes. The community was involved in the initial construction of the irrigation system and later took over its operation and maintenance. The powerhouse regulated working hours in Home Hill for 31 years by habitually blowing its whistle every day at 8am, 12 noon, 1 pm and 5 pm.

Life Herne has been identified as the John Heron who matriculated at Clare College, Cambridge in 1608. He was admitted a student at Lincoln's Inn on 21 January 1611, and was called to the bar there. On 5 March 1628 he was returned to parliament for , but was unseated on petition. In 1632 Herne defended Henry Sherfield in his trial in the Star- chamber for defacing a stained-glass window in St. Edmund's Church, Salisbury. He was also counsel for William Prynne on his trial for the publication of Histrio-Mastix in February 1634, and for the warden of the Fleet Prison before a commission which sat to investigate alleged abuses in the management there, in March 1635. In 1637 he was elected a bencher of his inn, and was Lent reader there in the following year. In 1641 he was one of the counsel for Sir John Bramston the elder and Sir Robert Berkeley, two of the judges impeached by the Long parliament over ship money. He has been tentatively identified as the Mr. Herne who defended Sir Richard Gurney, 1st Baronet in 1642. Herne was assigned 23 October 1641 to defend the bishops impeached for issuing the new canons of 1640; but declined to act on the ground that as a commoner he was \\"involved in all the acts and votes of the House of Commons\\". He was also one of the defence counsel in the impeachment of Archbishop Laud. He delivered a learned and eloquent speech for the defence on 11 October 1644, which was supposed at the time to have been composed by Matthew Hale, another of Laud's counsel. The gist of the argument was that no one of the articles of the impeachment was sufficient by itself to ground a charge of high treason, and that therefore the totality of them could not do so any more than, as Herne put it, \\"two hundred couple of black rabbits would make a black horse\\". After the trial was over Herne visited Laud in the Tower of London, brought him his prayer-book, which was in Prynne's hands, and was consulted by him about his speech on the scaffold.

It is the sequel of Manual of Love and was followed by Manual of Love 3. Plot The film is divided into four episodes, centered on the theme of love. =First segment= Dario and Nicola, two men from Apulia, are involved in a car accident. Both are taken to hospital suffering from paralysis of the legs, and there Nicola meets a beautiful nurse named Lucia. While Nicola continues his rehabilitation therapy, he finds that he loves Lucia more and more, and she, too, in time, falls in love with him. =Second segment= Franco and Manuela have been married for a short time, and they want a child. However, Franco has a low semen count, and this creates many complications for the couple. Given that in Italy the two cannot use artificial insemination, because the law prevents it, Franco and Manuela travel to Spain, where Manuela is admitted to a specialist clinic. Franco manages to make Manuela pregnant, and he hopes they will have a son. However, their unborn child proves to be a girl. =Third segment= Lecce, Salento: Fosco and Filippo are two young men in love. However, Fosco's father, a typical Italian southern man, does not tolerate his son's homosexuality, and disowns him. Fosco and Filippo, as well as having this problem, know that in Italy they cannot get married, or even take on the upbringing of a child, because the laws do not permit such things. After they have been fighting over these issues, Fosco is beaten up by homophobes, and is soon visited in hospital by Filippo, who promises to go to Spain where he will marry him. =Fourth segment= Ernesto is a highly regarded waiter in an expensive restaurant in Rome. He has a wife and children, although his life lacks passion. One day Ernesto meets Cecilia, an Argentinian girl who works in the restaurant as a dishwasher, and they fall in love. Ernesto is very fond of Cecilia, because he knows that she is suffering because she has been abandoned as a child by her father. Cecilia, delighted by their love affair, involves Ernesto in wild late-night parties, but he has a heart attack, and he realizes that the youthful life of Cecilia no longer suits him. So the two decide to end their affair, while agreeing to remain friends.

In the game, players construct a pirate ship, hire and train a crew, and guide their crew toward notoriety as renowned pirates.  Gameplay  Pixel Piracy puts the player in control of a pirate captain. The game's goal is to defeat four notorious pirates, but players are free to adventure in the game as they wish. After customizing difficulty settings, the player's captain spawns on an island where the player can build their own ship using a set of blocks and hire a crew. While traveling, the player must sate the crew's hunger and deal with equipment requirements. The captain can be killed by starvation or enemy pirates, or even by wild animals. The game has permadeath, so when the player's captain dies in the game the captain does not respawn. To embark, the player can select a destination on the world map. Locations range in population and danger. The computer controls the actual sailing, but the ship will stop for a battle if its route crosses an occupied map node. Ship battles are determined by acquired stats and by choices the player can make. Winning battles grants the player points and equipment which they can use to upgrade the crew. Upon reaching a destination, the inhabitants may be friendly or hostile toward the crew. Crew stats including health, morale, and supply level affect the success of pillaging at a destination.  Reception  Back in its early access period, the game was praised for its potential. PC Gamer Craig Pearson wrote in January 2014 that the game had \\"a gorgeous art style and cute soundtrack\\" that contrasted with the difficulty of the gameplay. He noted the result of the 'plunder' function (which destroys defeated vessels) surprised him, as it killed his captain and crew while they were aboard an enemy ship. He also lamented that the map and fighting needed organizational improvements. Pearson concluded, \\"But those are me picking at scabs: it's charming and atmospheric, I've had plenty of fun fiddling with its systems, and it doesn't feel like it'll easily run out of challenges. The game received a mixed reception upon release. On April 23, 2015, the development team issued a formal apology, acknowledging their failures and assuring players that much work had been and would continue to be done to meet all development promises and fix all of the game's issues. However, as of July 2020, the game has not been updated since February 2016.

It was known as Jobbeh Khaneh (house of weapons) in the Safavid period, as the museum housed a collection of military artifacts. Rebuilt during Qajar rule, the building has been decorated by stuccoed forms, which are the principal architectural feature of the Qajar period.

This methodology was first developed by Andreas Zeller of the Saarland University in 1999. In practice, the Delta Debugging algorithm builds on unit testing to isolate failure causes automatically - by systematically narrowing down failure- inducing circumstances until a minimal set remains. For example, if you can supply a test case that will produce the bug you are looking for, then you can feed that to the Delta Debugging algorithm, which will then simply try to trim useless functions and lines of code that are not needed to reproduce the bug, until a 1-minimal program is found. Delta Debugging has been applied to isolate failure-inducing program input (e.g. an HTML page that makes a Web browser fail), failure-inducing user interaction (e.g. the keystrokes that make a program crash), or failure-inducing changes to the program code (e.g. after a failing regression test). Later, some software development tools have been inspired by Delta Debugging, such as the bisect commands of revision control systems (e.g., git-bisect, svn-bisect, hg-bisect, etc.), which, instead of working on the program's code, apply the delta debugging methodology on the code history by comparing various versions until the faulty change is found.

The story of the dealings between the author and \\"the infatuated Fraser, with his dog's-meat tart of a magazine\\", was told in J. A. Froude's biography of Carlyle. On 3 August 1836 Grantley Berkeley assaulted Fraser, after the publication of criticism of his novel Berkeley Castle.

Fraser died 2 October 1841 at Argyll Street, London, after a lingering illness. Fraser's Magazine Fraser published Fraser's Magazine from February 1830, so-called in fact after the barrister Hugh Fraser who had founded it with William Maginn; Fraser himself referred to it as \\"The Town and Country\\". Among the contributors to the magazine were Thomas Carlyle, William Makepeace Thackeray, Francis Sylvester Mahony, Thomas Love Peacock, J. A. Froude, William Allingham, and other well-known writers.

Participants were recruited to the study between 1995 and 1997 and have since been in long-term follow up for health outcomes. The study has demonstrated an association of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) with health and social problems across the lifespan. The study has produced many scientific articles and conference and workshop presentations that examine ACEs.  Background  In the 1980s, the dropout rate of participants at Kaiser Permanente's obesity clinic in San Diego, California, was about 50%; despite all of the dropouts successfully losing weight under the program. Vincent Felitti, head of Kaiser Permanente's Department of Preventive Medicine in San Diego, conducted interviews with people who had left the program, and discovered that a majority of 286 people he interviewed had experienced childhood sexual abuse. The interview findings suggested to Felitti that weight gain might be a coping mechanism for depression, anxiety, and fear. Felitti and Robert Anda from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) went on to survey childhood trauma experiences of over 17,000 Kaiser Permanente patient volunteers. The 17,337 participants were volunteers from approximately 26,000 consecutive Kaiser Permanente members. About half were female; 74.8% were white; the average age was 57; 75.2% had attended college; all had jobs and good health care, because they were members of the Kaiser health maintenance organization. Participants were asked about different types of adverse childhood experiences that had been identified in earlier research literature: * Physical abuse * Sexual abuse * Emotional abuse * Physical neglect * Emotional neglect * Exposure to domestic violence * Household substance abuse * Household mental illness * Parental separation or divorce * Incarcerated household member The questions used can be found published as the NPR ACE quiz.  Findings  The ACE Pyramid represents the conceptual framework for the ACE Study, which has uncovered how adverse childhood experiences are strongly related to various risk factors for disease throughout the lifespan, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. According to the United States' Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the ACE study found that: * Adverse childhood experiences are common. For example, 28% of study participants reported physical abuse and 21% reported sexual abuse. Many also reported experiencing a divorce or parental separation, or having a parent with a mental and/or substance use disorder. * Adverse childhood experiences often occur together. Almost 40% of the original sample reported two or more ACEs and 12.5% experienced four or more. Because ACEs occur in clusters, many subsequent studies have examined the cumulative effects of ACEs rather than the individual effects of each. * Adverse childhood experiences have a dose–response relationship with many health problems. As researchers followed participants over time, they discovered that a person's cumulative ACEs score has a strong, graded relationship to numerous health, social, and behavioral problems throughout their lifespan, including substance use disorders. Furthermore, many problems related to ACEs tend to be comorbid, or co- occurring. About two-thirds of individuals reported at least one adverse childhood experience; 87% of individuals who reported one ACE reported at least one additional ACE. The number of ACEs was strongly associated with adulthood high-risk health behaviors such as smoking, alcohol and drug abuse, promiscuity, and severe obesity, and correlated with ill-health including depression, heart disease, cancer, chronic lung disease and shortened lifespan. Compared to an ACE score of zero, having four adverse childhood experiences was associated with a seven-fold (700%) increase in alcoholism, a doubling of risk of being diagnosed with cancer, and a four-fold increase in emphysema; an ACE score above six was associated with a 30-fold (3000%) increase in attempted suicide. The ACE study's results suggest that maltreatment and household dysfunction in childhood contribute to health problems decades later. These include chronic diseases—such as heart disease, cancer, stroke, and diabetes—that are the most common causes of death and disability in the United States. The study's findings, while relating to a specific population within the United States, might reasonably be assumed to reflect similar trends in other parts of the world, according to the World Health Organization. The study was initially published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.  Subsequent surveys  The ACE Study has produced more than 50 articles that look at the prevalence and consequences of ACEs. It has been influential in several areas. Subsequent studies have confirmed the high frequency of adverse childhood experiences, or found even higher incidences in urban or youth populations. The original study questions have been used to develop a 10-item screening questionnaire. Numerous subsequent surveys have confirmed that adverse childhood experiences are frequent. State ACEs Study surveys diagram color coded from the year 2009 to 2015 The CDC runs the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), an annual survey conducted by individual state health departments in all 50 states. An expanded survey instrument in several states found each state to be similar. Some states have collected additional local data. Adverse childhood experiences were even more frequent in studies in urban Philadelphia and in a survey of young mothers (mostly younger than 19). Internationally, an Adverse Childhood Experiences International Questionnaire (ACE-IQ) is undergoing validation testing. Surveys of adverse childhood experiences have been conducted in Romania, the Czech Republic, the Republic of Macedonia, Norway, the Philippines, the United Kingdom, Canada, China and Jordan. Child Trends used data from the 2011/12 National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH) to analyze ACEs prevalence in children nationally, and by state. The NSCH's list of \\"adverse family experiences\\" includes a measure of economic hardship and shows that this is the most common ACE reported nationally.  Neurobiology of stress  Cognitive and neuroscience researchers have examined possible mechanisms that might explain the negative consequences of adverse childhood experiences on adult health. Adverse childhood experiences can alter the structural development of neural networks and the biochemistry of neuroendocrine systems and may have long-term effects on the body, including speeding up the processes of disease and aging and compromising immune systems. Allostatic load refers to the adaptive processes that maintain homeostasis during times of toxic stress through the production of mediators such as adrenaline, cortisol and other chemical messengers. According to researcher Bruce S. McEwen, who coined the term: Additionally, epigenetic transmission may occur due to stress during pregnancy or during interactions between mother and newborns. Maternal stress, depression, and exposure to partner violence have all been shown to have epigenetic effects on infants.  Implementing practices  As knowledge about the prevalence and consequences of adverse childhood experiences increases, trauma-informed and resilience- building practices based on the research is being implemented in communities, education, public health departments, social services, faith-based organizations and criminal justice. A few states are considering legislation. = Communities = As knowledge about the prevalence and consequences of ACEs increases, more communities seek to integrate trauma-informed and resilience- building practices into their agencies and systems. Tarpon Springs, Florida, became the first trauma-informed community in 2011.Stevens \\"Community Projects\\", ACEs Connection, 25 September 2012Saenger \\"PEACE4TARPON Trauma Informed Community Initiative\\", 30 March 2014 Trauma-informed initiatives in Tarpon Springs include trauma-awareness training for the local housing authority, changes in programs for ex-offenders, and new approaches to educating students with learning difficulties.Stevens \\"Tarpon Springs, FL, may be first trauma-informed city in U.S.\\", ACEs Too High, 13 February 2012 Research with American Indian tribal communities has demonstrated that social support and cultural involvement can ameliorate the effects of ACEs. =Education= ACEs exposure is widespread in the US, one study from the National Survey of Children's Health reported that approximately 68% of children 0–17 years old had experienced one or more ACEs. The impact of ACEs on children can manifest in difficulties focusing, self regulating, trusting others, and can lead to negative cognitive effects. One study found that a child with 4 or more ACEs was 32 times more likely to be labeled with a behavioral or cognitive problem than a child with no ACEs. Another study by the Area Health Education Center of Washington State University found that students with at least three ACEs are three times as likely to experience academic failure, six times as likely to have behavioral problems, and five times as likely to have attendance problems.Stevens \\"Spokane, WA, students’ trauma prompts search for solutions\\", ACEs Too High, 28 February 2012 The trauma-informed school movement aims to train teachers and staff to help children self-regulate, and to help families that are having problems that result in children's normal response to trauma. It also seeks to provide behavioral consequences that will not re-traumatize a child.Stevens \\"Massachusetts, Washington State lead U.S. trauma-sensitive school movement\\", ACEs Too High, 31 May 2012 Trauma-informed education refers to the specific use of knowledge about trauma and its expression to modify support for children to improve their developmental success. The National Child Traumatic Stress Network (NCTSN) describes a trauma-informed school system as a place where school community members work to provide trauma awareness, knowledge and skills to respond to potentially negative outcomes following traumatic stress. The NCTSN published a study that discussed the ARC (attachment, regulation and competency) model, which other researchers have based their subsequent studies of trauma-informed education practices off of. Trauma-sensitive or trauma- informed schooling has become increasingly popular in Washington, Massachusetts, and California in the last 10 years. One study details how several San Francisco schools provided trauma-informed support based on the ARC model to students, adults in the system, and the school system as a whole through universal learning strategies, plans and techniques for children with trauma, and by providing trauma-informed therapy to those children. At El Dorado, an elementary school in this study in San Francisco, trauma-informed practices were associated with a suspension reduction of 89%.Stevens \\"San Francisco’s El Dorado Elementary uses trauma-informed & restorative practices; suspensions drop 89%\\", ACEs Too High, 28 January 2014 Lincoln High School in Walla Walla, Washington, adapted a trauma-informed approached to discipline and reduced its suspensions by 85%. Rather than standard punishment, students are taught to recognize their reaction to stress and learn to control it. Spokane, Washington, schools conducted a research study that demonstrated that academic risk was correlated with students’ experiences of traumatic events known to their teachers.Stevens \\"There’s no such thing as a bad kid in these Spokane, WA, trauma-informed elementary schools\\", ACEs Too High, 20 August 2013 The same school district has begun a study to test the impact of trauma- informed intervention programs, in an attempt to reduce the impact of toxic stress. In Brockton, Massachusetts, a community-wide meeting led to a trauma- informed approach being adopted by the Brockton School District. So far, all of the district's elementary schools have implemented trauma-informed improvement plans, and there are plans to do the same in the middle school and high school. About one-fifth of the district teachers have participated in a course on teaching traumatized students. Police alert schools when they have arrested someone or visited at a student's address. Massachusetts state legislation has sought to require all schools to develop plans to create \\"safe and supportive schools\\". =Social services= Social service providers—including welfare systems, housing authorities, homeless shelters, and domestic violence centers – are adopting trauma-informed approaches that help to prevent ACEs or minimize their impact. Utilizing tools that screen for trauma can help a social service worker direct their clients to interventions that meet their specific needs.Meister \\"Addressing Child Traumatic Stress in Child Welfare\\", Common Ground, July 2012 Trauma-informed practices can also help social service providers look at how trauma impacts the whole family.Family-Informed Trauma Treatment Center 15 July 2014 Trauma-informed approaches can improve child welfare services by 1) openly discussing trauma and 2) addressing parental trauma.Stevens \\"‘Starve the beast,’ say these cities – but don’t cut people off; reduce need for services instead\\", ACEs Too High, 30 July 2012 The New Hampshire Division for Children Youth and Families (DCYF) is taking a trauma-informed approach to their foster care services by educating staff about childhood trauma, screening children entering foster care for trauma, using trauma-informed language to mitigate further traumatization, mentoring birth parents and involving them in collaborative parenting, and training foster parents to be trauma-informed. In Albany, New York the HEARTS Initiative has led to local organizations developing trauma- informed practice. Senior Hope Inc., an organization serving adults over the age of 50, began implementing the 10-question ACE survey and talking with their clients about childhood trauma. The LaSalle School, which serves orphaned and abandoned boys, began looking at delinquent boys in from a trauma-informed perspective and began administering the ACE questionnaire to their clients. Housing authorities are also becoming trauma-informed. Supportive housing can sometimes recreate control and power dynamics associated with clients’ early trauma.Bebout \\"Waiting on the welcome mat: How to be at home with trauma-informed care\\" , camh Cross Currents, Winter 2010/2011 This can be reduced through trauma-informed practices, such as training staff to be respectful of clients' space by scheduling appointments and not letting themselves into clients' private spaces, and also understanding that an aggressive response may be trauma-related coping strategies. The housing authority in Tarpon Springs provided trauma-awareness training to staff so they could better understand and react to their clients' stress and anger resulting from poor employment, health, and housing. A survey of 200 homeless individuals in California and New York demonstrated that more than 50% had experienced at least four ACEs.ACEs 360 \\"‘ACEs 360-New York\\" , ACEs 360 Iowa, Retrieved 15 July 2014 In Petaluma, California, the Committee on the Shelterless (COTS) uses a trauma-informed approach called Restorative Integral Support (RIS) to reduce intergenerational homelessness.Larkin et al. \\"‘Mobilizing resilience and recovery in response to adverse childhood experiences (ACE) among homeless people: A Restorative Integral Support (RIS) case study\\", Prevention Summit, Retrieved 15 July 2014 RIS increases awareness of and knowledge about ACEs, and calls on staff to be compassionate and focus on the whole person. COTS now consider themselves ACE-informed and focus on resiliency and recovery. =Health care services= Screening for or talking about ACEs with parents and children can help to foster healthy physical and psychological development and can help doctors understand the circumstances that children and their parents are facing. By screening for ACEs in children, pediatric doctors and nurses can better understand behavioral problems. Some doctors have questioned whether some behaviors resulting in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnoses are in fact reactions to trauma. Children who have experienced four or more ACEs are three times as likely to take ADHD medication when compared with children with less than four ACEs.Ruiz \\"How Childhood Trauma Could Be Mistaken for ADHD\\", The Atlantic, 7 July 2014 Screening parents for their ACEs allows doctors to provide the appropriate support to parents who have experienced trauma, helping them to build resilience, foster attachment with their children, and prevent a family cycle of ACEs.Stevens \\"To prevent childhood trauma, pediatricians screen children and their parents…and sometimes, just parents…for childhood trauma\\", ACEs Too High, 29 July 2014American Academy of Pediatrics \\"Promoting Children’s Health and Resiliency: A Strengthening Families Approach\\" , Center for the Study of Social Policy Trauma-informed pediatric care also allows doctors to develop a more trusting relationship with parents, opening the lines of communication.Gottlieb \\"Toxic Stress and Trauma-Informed Pediatric Care\\" , Massachusetts Child Psychiatry Access Project At Montefiore Medical Center ACEs screenings will soon be implemented in 22 pediatric clinics. In a pilot program, any child with one parent who has an ACE score of four or higher is offered enrollment and receive a variety of services. For families enrolled in the program parents report fewer ER visits and children have healthier emotional and social development, compared with those not enrolled.Montefiore Medical Group \\"Healthy Steps Program\\", Montefiore Medical Group =Public health= Most American doctors as of 2015 do not use ACE surveys to assess patients. Objections to doing so include that there are no randomized controlled trials that show that such surveys can be used to actually improve health outcomes, there are no standard protocols for how to use the information gathered, and that revisiting negative childhood experiences could be emotionally traumatic. Other obstacles to adoption include that the technique is not taught in medical schools, is not billable, and the nature of the conversation makes some doctors personally uncomfortable. Some public health centers see ACEs as an important way (especially for mothers and children)Hellerstedt \\"Adverse Childhood Experience: Public Health Surveillance Measures\\", Healthy Generations, Spring 2013 to target health interventions for individuals during sensitive periods of development early in their life, or even in utero. For example, Jefferson Country Public Health clinic in Port Townsend, Washington, now screens pregnant women, their partners, parents of children with special needs, and parents involved with CPS for ACEs.Stevens \\"Public health clinic adds child trauma to smoking, alcohol, HIV screening\\", ACEs Too High, 23 March 2012 With regard to patient counseling, the clinic treats ACEs like other health risks such as smoking or alcohol consumption. =Resilience and Resources= Resilience is not a trait that people either have or do not have. It involves behaviors, thoughts and actions that can be learned and developed in anyone. According to the American Psychological Association (2017), resilience is the ability to adapt in the face of adversity, tragedy, threats or significant stress — such as family and relationship problems, serious health problems or workplace and financial stressors. Resilience refers to bouncing back from difficult experiences in life. There is nothing extraordinary about resilience. People often demonstrate resilience in times of adversity. However, being resilient does not mean that a person will not experience difficulty or distress, as emotional pain is common for people when they suffer from a major adversity or trauma. In fact, the path to resilience often involves considerable emotional pain [70]. Resilience and access to other resources are protective factors. Having resilience can benefit children who have been exposed to trauma and have a higher ACE score. Children who can learn to develop it, can use resilience to build themselves up after trauma. A child who has not developed resilience will have a harder time coping with the challenges that can come in adult life. People and children who are resilient, embrace the thinking that adverse experiences do not define who they are. They also can think about past events in their lives that were traumatic, and, try to reframe them in a way that is constructive. They are able to find strength in their struggle and ultimately can overcome the challenges and adversity that was faced in childhood. In childhood, resiliency can come from having a caring adult in a child's life. Resiliency can also come from having meaningful moments such as an academic achievement or getting praise from teachers or mentors. In adulthood, resilience is the concept of self-care. If you are taking care of yourself and taking the necessary time to reflect and build on your experiences, then you will have a higher capacity for taking care of others. Adults can also use this skill to counteract some of the trauma they have experienced. Self-care can mean a variety of things. One example of self-care, is knowing when you are beginning to feel burned out and then taking a step back to rest and recuperate yourself. Another component of self-care is practicing mindfulness or engaging in some form of prayer or meditation. If you are able to take the time to reflect upon your experiences, then you will be able to build a greater level of resiliency moving forward. All of these strategies put together can help to build resilience and counteract some of the childhood trauma that was experienced. With these strategies children can begin to heal after experiencing adverse childhood experiences. This aspect of resiliency is so important because it enables people to find hope in their traumatic past. When first looking at the ACE study and the different correlations that come with having 4 or more traumas, it is easy to feel defeated. It is even possible for this information to encourage people to have unhealthy coping behaviors. Introducing resilience and the data that supports its positive outcome in regards to trauma, allows for a light at the end of a tunnel. It gives people the opportunity to be proactive instead of reactive when it comes to addressing the traumas in their past. =Criminal justice= Since research on decarceration in the United States suggests that incarcerated individuals are much more likely to have been exposed to violence and suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD),Miller & Najavits \\"Creating trauma-informed correctional care: a balance of goals and environment\\", European Journal of Psychotraumatology, 2012 a trauma-informed approach may better help to address some of these criminogenic risk factors and can create a less traumatizing criminal justice experience. Programs, like Seeking Safety, are often used to help individuals in the criminal justice system learn how to better cope with trauma, PTSD, and substance abuse.Seeking Safety \\"Seeking Safety: A Model to Improve Coping Skills\\", Seeking Safety Juvenile courts better help deter children from crime and delinquency when they understand the trauma many of these children have experienced.Buffington et al. \\"Ten Things Every Juvenile Court Judge Should Know About Trauma and Delinquency\\", NCJFCJ, 2010 The criminal justice system itself can also retraumatize individuals.National Association of State Mental Health Program Director \\"Creating A Place Of Healing and Forgiveness: The Trauma-Informed Care Initiative at the Women’s Community Correctional Center of Hawaii\\" , NASMHPD, 2013 This can be prevented by creating safer facilities where correctional and police officers are properly trained to keep incidents from escalating. Partnerships between police and mental health providers can also reduce the possible traumatizing effects of police intervention and help provide families with the proper mental health and social services.The National Child Traumatic Stress Network \\"Creating A Trauma-Informed Law Enforcement System\\", NCTSN, April 2018 The Women's Community Correctional Center of Hawaii began a Trauma-Informed Care Initiative that aims to train all employees to be aware and sensitive to trauma, to screen all women in their facility for trauma, to assess those who have experienced trauma, and begin providing trauma-informed mental health care to those women identified. =Faith-based organizations= Some faith-based organizations offer spiritual services in response to traumas identified by ACE surveys. For example, the founder of ACE Overcomers combined the epidemiology of ACEs, the neurobiology of toxic stress and principles of the Christian Bible into a workbook and 12-week course used by clergy in several states.Stevens \\"Ex-pastor marries science, Bible studies to heal wounds of childhood trauma\\", ACEs Connection, 13 March 2012 Another example of this integration of faith-based principles and ACEs science is the work of Intermountain Residential's Chaplain Chris Haughee, who has created a curriculum called \\"Bruised Reeds and Smoldering Wicks\\" a six-week study meant to introduce the science behind ACEs and early childhood trauma within the context of Christian theology and ministry practice. Published in 2017, it has been used by ministry professionals in 30 states, the District of Columbia, and two Canadian provinces. Faith-based organizations also participate in the online group ACES Connection Network. The Faith and Health Connection ministry also applies principles of Christian theology to address childhood traumas in their teachings. =Legislation= Vermont has passed a bill, Act 43(H.508), an act relating to building resilience for individuals experiencing adverse childhood experiences which acknowledges the life span effects of ACEs on health outcomes, seeks wide use of ACE screening by health providers and aims to educate medical and health school students about ACEs.Prewitt \\"Vermont first state to propose bill to screen for ACEs in health care\\", ACEs Connection, 18 March 2014 Previously Washington State passed legislation to set up a public-private partnership to further community development of trauma-informed and resilience-building practices that had begun in that state; but it was not adequately funded. On August 18, 2014, California lawmakers unanimously passed ACR No. 155, which encourages policies reducing children's exposure to adverse experiences.Prewitt \\"CA Senate unanimously approves ACEs reduction resolution\\", ACEs Too High, 21 August 2014 Recent Massachusetts legislation supports a trauma-informed school movement as part of The Reduction of Gun Violence bill (No. 4376).

It was written and directed by Luke Moran, who co- stars alongside Sean Astin, Omid Abtahi, Sara Paxton, and John Heard. Filmmakers Edward Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz served as executive producers on the film, which was produced by Luke Moran and Cru Ennis. The film was released in U.S. theaters on March 28, 2014.  Plot  The film starts in 2003, the day before 22-year-old Jack Farmer (Luke Moran) ships out for Iraq, having joined the Army Reserves in hopes of being part of something bigger than himself. He and dozens of other young men arrive at Abu Ghraib, a prison located 20 miles from Baghdad. CO Capt. Hayes (Scott Patterson) greets them with a rousing speech about them standing on the front lines of the war against terrorism, but the poor living conditions and boredom begin to wear on the soldiers. Jack requests MP duty, undaunted by the cautionary tale of an earlier volunteer who had the same idea and wound up shooting himself in the foot to escape. With no training, briefing or idea what to expect, Jack is transferred to \\"Hard Site\\"—a cellblock that supposedly houses hard-core terrorists. His new boss, Sgt. Tanner (Sean Astin), tells him that the Hard Site's guiding principle is \\"no compassion\\"; their job is to \\"soften up\\" prisoners for military interrogators. This includes tactics like sensory deprivation, humiliation and isolation. Jack has his reservations about the treatment of detainees at the prison. He strikes up a friendship with one of the detainees Ghazi Hammoud (Omid Abtahi), a London-educated engineer. Just days before they were scheduled to return home, Jack and his unit learn that their tour of duty has been extended by six months. They are devastated but continue their day to day duties. Hammoud is subjected to multiple rough interrogations. The guards shackle him to the cell so he is forced to stand and tell Jack to let him shit himself. When Jack finally confronts his fellow soldiers, defending Hammoud's innocence, he learns that Hammoud has confessed to building a bomb that killed 18 civilians in a coffee shop. Jack confronts Hammoud asking if he killed \\"innocent people\\" to which Hammoud replies that they were not innocent. Jack breaks down and subsequently adopts a more aggressive posture, treating the detainees less kindly than he had prior to Hammoud's confession. When it is finally time for Jack to go home, he briefs the soldier set to replace him, much like Tanner had briefed him. His replacement takes out a camera and snaps a photo, but Jack tells him to put the camera away. When Jack notices Hammoud has fallen asleep, he drags the prisoner out of the cell and begins yelling at him. Unknown to Jack, the second soldier snaps another picture. After returning home to the US, Jack sees the news coverage of the Abu Graib scandal breaking on live TV, with the pictures snapped of him as he is shopping at a local store with his girlfriend  Cast  * Luke Moran as Jack Farmer * Sean Astin as Staff Sergeant Tanner * Omid Abtahi as Ghazi Hammoud * Sara Paxton as Peyton * John Heard as Sam Farmer * Michael Welch as Eugene \\"Pits\\" Fowler * Elijah Kelley as Babatunde \\"Tunde\\" Ogundule * John Robinson as Ryan Fox * Scott Patterson as Captain Hayes * Cru Ennis as Shaw * Jerry Hernandez as Rodeo * Kylie Rogers as Daughter  Production  Shooting occurred in Santa Fe, New Mexico at the Penitentiary of New Mexico, location of the New Mexico State Penitentiary riot. One scene was also shot at the now closed Baillios Electronics in Santa Fe, New Mexico.  Reception  Some critics criticized the film for not depicting the exact events of the scandal, but fictionalizing a story based on these events, while other appreciated the story and its one-step-at-a-time explanation of how an event like this actually came to pass. Audience reviews were more positive, most particularly from veterans for its realistic depiction of a soldier's deployment and its lack of a political agenda. The film won the Audience Award at the Gasparilla Film Festival and the War on Screen International Film Festival, the only two film festivals it screened at.

Background Nesta Wyn Ellis was born and brought up in Snowdonia, North Wales, where her extracurricular training in the performing arts began. She was educated at Llanrwst Grammar School in Denbighshire and at the University of Liverpool, where she obtained a B.Sc. She travelled widely in Africa in the 1970s when she launched her career in journalism interviewing dissidents in South Africa and subsequently lived partly over three years at the Mount Kenya Safari Club, then part-time in the US in Washington DC for over a decade and more recently in Paris. Musical and dramatic arts have formed the basis of the work in which she is currently involved; film and music production, direction and performance. In April 2000 she moved from London to Paris where she continued her musical development, singing French favourites as well as her own compositions in French and English. Her accomplishments were noted by some UK TV companies who filmed documentaries of her life in Paris. Professional career Much of Nesta Wyn Ellis's early writing was about political issues, such as African political and human rights articles in The Guardian to the Snowdonia National Park in The Illustrated London News.Ellis, Nesta Wyn. \\"Saving Snowdonia.\\" Illustrated London News [London, England] [27 Mar. 1976]: 40+. Illustrated London News. Web. 13 Mar. 2014. She became the political correspondent for the magazine Harpers and Queen. She was a frequent contributor of articles to the UK quality newspapers such as The Times and magazines, including Punch and well known for her two biographies (of John Major and of the Marquess of Bath) and several novels, each different in their style of storytelling and material. Her exclusive articles sent from Africa's troubled zones in the 1970s appeared in The Guardian. Later she became a contributor to the humorous weekly, Punch, and political correspondent of Harper's & Queen. During the 1980s, her often controversial profiles of well known people, including many leading politicians appeared in the weekend magazines of The Sunday Times, The Telegraph, The Mail on Sunday, The Sunday Mirror and The People, and in Woman's Journal and were syndicated worldwide. Her books and journalism have led to frequent TV appearances and documentaries have been built around her books and other artistic work, including stage performances in London, Paris and the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. She is a singer and composer who hand writes her piano scores to accompany her lyrics in English and French. Her stage performances have led to film appearances in long and short features. She is also a producer with her service to foreign production companies, 'Paris Production Services' and is producing with her British company Lioness Films Ltd (UK) her first feature, currently in Development, is \\"Three Days In September\\", the story of a singer who follows her love to Paris, which she will also direct.She has also written songs and music to form the basis of the score. Political career She was attracted to the Liberal party, her native North Wales being strongly identified with Lloyd George. She was a ward secretary and Young Liberal Chairman of St. Marylebone Association from 1964 to 1966.The Times House of Commons, 1966 At the age of 25 she stood for Parliament as Liberal candidate for the Spelthorne Division of Surrey at the General Election of March 1966. Her career as author, journalist and commentator was preceded by an emphasis on her political activities: these have included standing four times in Westminster Parliamentary elections, as a Liberal including one bye-election in Brighton Pavilion and in the first European Parliamentary election of 1979. After the latter she withdrew from political life to pursue her writing career. But her books, especially the novel 'The Banker's Daughter' (Sidgwick and Jackson 1989, Blake 1994, Lioness Books on Amazon Kindle 2014) and her biography of John Major, (Macdonald 1991, Futura 1992, Dynasty Press on Kindle 2015) have benefited from her political experience, the latter especially on the hustings upon which she was able to write with personal empathy of John Major's early political career. Her critical commentaries on political events and personalities have continued in her blogs from Paris and London. In 1967 she was adopted as Liberal prospective parliamentary candidate for the Folkestone and Hythe division of Kent.OUR POLITICAL STAFF. \\"Liberals 'split wide open'.\\" Times [London, England] 12 Dec. 1967: 4. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 13 Mar. 2014. In 1968 she campaigned for the Liberal Party Leader to be elected by the party membership rather than just the Liberal MPs.OUR POLITICAL STAFF. \\"Liberal youth sound views on a split.\\" Times [London, England] 1 July 1968: 2. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 13 Mar. 2014. She did not contest the Folkestone seat as she was selected as Liberal candidate for the Brighton Pavilion Division of Sussex at the 1969 Brighton Pavilion by-election. During the campaign, she called for the UK government to recognise the Republic of Biafra a secessionist state in south-eastern Nigeria that existed from 30 May 1967 to 15 January 1970.The battle of Brighton, The Spectator, 20 March 1969 In 1969 she published a 4-page pamphlet 'Nesta Wyn Ellis, Liberal, Says Together We Can'. Although she did not contest the 1970 General Election she remained active in the Liberal party. She was a representative of the Hampstead Liberal Association at the 1970 Liberal Assembly speaking in debate on British foreign policy in Africa.'Arms went to S Africa'.\\" Times [London, England] 28 Sept. 1970: 4. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 13 Mar. 2014. She was Liberal candidate for the Chipping Barnet Division of Greater London at the February 1974 General Election. In 1974 she published 'Dear Elector: The Truth about MPs' based partly on her own first hand experience as a UK Parliamentary candidate and also on interviews with politicians and their wives. She was again Liberal candidate for the Chipping Barnet Division of Greater London at the October 1974 General Election. In 1977 she became concerned at the increase in support for the far right fascist parties in Britain, writing an article in The Times on the subject.\\"Disturbing signs that fascism could be just round the corner in Britain.\\" Times [London, England] 1 June 1977: 7. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 13 Mar. 2014. In 1978 when the Liberal party leader David Steel proposed the Lib-Lab Pact to prop up the Labour government, Wyn Ellis, along with the likes of former party leader Jo Grimond opposed the idea.\\"Mr Steel might envisage pact with the Tories.\\" Times [London, England] 17 Jan. 1978: 2. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 13 Mar. 2014. For her final public election, she stood for the first time in her native part of Britain, as Liberal candidate for the North Wales constituency at the first European Parliament elections in 1979. In 1989, her first novel, \\"The Banker's Daughter\\" a story set in the worlds of politics, banking and crime brought her public acclaim in the field of fiction writing. In 1991 she published a biography of British Prime Minister John Major to the accompaniment of year long daily press coverage and tabloid sensation. A lighthearted anthology of brief biographies, \\"Brtiain's Top 100 Eligible Bachelors,\\" led to frequent TV appearances on studio programmes and documentaries throughout the 1990s. In 2010 Dynasty Press published her biography of Alexander Thynn, 7th Marquess of Bath. In 1995, after singing on a BBC Arena pilot documentary about Jimi Hendrix, she began composing songs and in October 2007 launched her work with an album \\"Experience of Love\\" at a cocktail concert sponsored by Camelot at the Pizza on the Park, a premier London jazz venue. Other dinner and cocktail concerts followed at prime London venues including St James Church, Piccadilly with a concert to heal the nation after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. A dinner concert on 14 February 1999 at The Poet's House also launched her Collection of poems 'Love Notes.\\" In August 1999 she took an all French one woman show, \\"Saisons d'Amour\\" to The Edinburgh Fringe. She performed this again at Le Pibar in Paris in October 2000. In Paris she developed a new career working with music and film. She continued composing and performed her songs and French Repertoire classics at cafe concerts. In 2001, she recorded an all French album, Les Rivages de Paradis. She played the star role in an award-winning short film Bolsa de Huesos y Recuerdos written and directed by Venezuelan film maker Beatriz Ciliberto, for which she also composed and performed the song \\"Tes Yeux\\" (see IMDB). She played small roles in a number of French film productions, notably the award-winning Venus Noire and Coco that were released internationally, and in numerous other French productions. She also wrote a further three novels, The Mistress, A Love Is Like a Day, Three Days in September (film in development) recently published by Lioness Books on Amazon Kindle.Nesta Wyn Ellis at Amazon.com In 2007, she launched her facilities service, Paris Production Services, now an arm of her UK based film production company Lioness Films Ltd. She supports international film companies by providing on the ground facilities for their productions based in Paris and the rest of France.

The principle and robotic device was described by Walter Schubert in 1997Schubert W. (1997) Automated device and method for measuring and identifying molecules or fragments thereof. European patent EP 0810428 B1 [see also Schubert W. US patent 6,150,173 (2000); Japanese patent 3739528 (1998)]. and has been further developed with his co-workers within the human toponome project. The ICM runs robotically controlled repetitive incubation-imaging-bleaching cycles with dye-conjugated probe libraries recognizing target structures in situ (biomolecules in fixed cells or tissue sections). This results in the transmission of a randomly large number of distinct biological informations by re-using the same fluorescence channel after bleaching for the transmission of another biological information using the same dye which is conjugated to another specific probe, a.s.o. Thereby noise-reduced quasi-multichannel fluorescence images with reproducible physical, geometrical, and biophysical stabilities are generated. The resulting power of combinatorial molecular discrimination (PCMD) per data point is given by 65,536k, where 65,536 is the number of grey value levels (output of a 16-bit CCD camera), and k is the number of co-mapped biomolecules and/or subdomains per biomolecule(s). High PCMD has been shown for k = 100, and in principle can be expanded for much higher numbers of k. In contrast to traditional multichannel–few-parameter fluorescence microscopy (panel a in the figure) high PCMDs in an ICM lead to high functional and spatial resolution (panel b in the figure). Systematic ICM analysis of biological systems reveals the supramolecular segregation law that describes the principle of order of large, hierarchically organized biomolecular networks in situ (toponome). The ICM is the core technology for the systematic mapping of the complete protein network code in tissues (human toponome project). The original ICM method includes any modification of the bleaching step. Corresponding modifications have been reported for antibody retrieval and chemical dye-quenching debated recently. The Toponome Imaging Systems (TIS) and multi-epitope-ligand cartographs (MELC) represent different stages of the ICM technological development. Imaging cycler microscopy received the American ISAC best paper award in 2008 for the three symbol code of organized proteomes.

Function and performance Hayashi Oen, a nineteenth-century practitioner of ukehi, identified six functions of the rite. He claimed it could be used to: * ask for information or messages from the kami * establish the will of the kami * predict the outcome of an event * enervate or animate living * control bad weather * kill one's enemies The dictates of ukehi can come as a dream, but more commonly the petitioner would use the ritual to ask a question of the kami and then await an omen of some sort to confirm their response. If nothing happened, it was assumed that the kami did not favour the proposed course of action. The questioning of the kami took the form of an oath or vow. Sometimes the ritual involved inscribing the choices available on bamboo slips, which were then shaken in a container; whichever slip fell out dictated the appropriate course of action.

(B) Schematic of an assembled Foldscope illustrating panning, and (C) cross-sectional view illustrating flexure-based focusing. (D) Foldscope components and tools used in the assembly, including Foldscope paper components, ball lens, button-cell battery, surface-mounted LED, switch, copper tape and polymeric filters. (E) Different modalities assembled from colored paper stock. (F) Novice users demonstrating the technique for using the Foldscope. (G) Demonstration of the field-rugged design, such as stomping under foot. A Foldscope is an optical microscope that can be assembled from simple components, including a sheet of paper and a lens. It was developed by Manu Prakash and designed to cost less than US$1 to build. It is part of the \\"frugal science\\" movement which aims to make cheap and easy tools available for scientific use in the developing world.  History  The basic principle of using a small spherical lens held close to the eye dates back to Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723), who was the first to see single-celled organisms using such a lens held in a device of his own design. The Foldscope was developed by a team led by Manu Prakash, an assistant professor of bioengineering at the Stanford School of Medicine. The project was funded by several organisations including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which gave a grant of US $100,000 for research in November 2012. The idea for creating a low-cost microscope came to Prakash in 2011 while he was at a field station in Thailand. He remarked that the station had a very expensive microscope but that everyone was afraid to use it because it was fragile and worth more than most people's salaries. He wanted to create an affordable microscope that would be versatile and sturdy enough to work in field conditions. He also wanted to create a device that people felt they had ownership of, which is part of the reason the Foldscope comes in a kit to be assembled. He developed the first prototype in 2014.  Details  A Foldscope is an optical microscope that can be assembled from a punched sheet of cardstock, a spherical glass lens, a light emitting diode and a diffuser panel, along with a watch battery that powers the LED. Once assembled, the Foldscope is about the size of a bookmark. The Foldscope weighs 8 grams and comes in a kit with multiple lenses that provide magnification from 140X to 2,000X. The kit also includes magnets that can be stuck onto the Foldscope to attach it to a smartphone, allowing the user to take pictures of the magnification. The magnification power is enough to enable the spotting of organisms such as Leishmania donovani and Escherichia coli, as well as malarial parasites. A Foldscope can be printed on a standard A4 sheet of paper and assembled in seven minutes. Prakash claims that the Foldscope can survive harsh conditions, including being thrown in water or dropped from a five-story building. Following the first generation of simple Foldscopes, twelve medical diagnostic Foldscope variants are in development with each type being designed specifically to aid in the identification of a particular disease-causing organism. Included with each Foldscope, a picture is provided of the particular microbe to look for on each disease-specific variant. To enable several people to use them at once, each microscope is able to project images with a built-in projector. The Foldscope is designed to be assembled by the end user, and hence is color-coded to help with the assembly. Each unit costs less than one US dollar to build, with estimates varying from 50 cents to 97 cents.  Uses  The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation funded the \\"Ten Thousand Microscopes\\" project under which Prakash plans to give away 10,000 Foldscope kits to interested parties, including students for research. The projects eventually expanded to 50,000 Foldscope kits. Those who received the kits were encouraged to share their experiences using the microscope on a website, Foldscope Explore, so that Prakash's team could see how people could use the Foldscope. Examples of uses submitted by testers include a plant pathologist in Rwanda who used it to examine fungi on banana crops and Maasai children in Tanzania who used it to check cow feces for parasites. The goal of this project is not only to supply microscopes to those who would not otherwise have access to them but also to advance the general study of biomimicry. By encouraging thousands of volunteers to submit findings about the microorganisms they observe in their local environment, Prakash hopes to find more organisms that could provide clues about how to build new tools that take advantage of these organisms' natural abilities. In October 2015, India's Department of Biotechnology announced a program to make Foldscopes available across India at 80 approved colleges and programs. It will be used as a teaching tool for students in biology, chemistry and physics. After the pilot program, the Department hopes to work with Prakash to develop more low-cost science tools. Foldscope sets will also be produced and tested in Kenya and Uganda. Although the Foldscope has proven itself useful for a number of tasks, it is not currently adapted to be used as a medical diagnostic tool. When tested for diagnosing schistosomiasis in Ghana, for example, it was impossible to prevent contamination from urine samples because the Foldscope must be brought up to one's face to view. Jim Cybulski, a former graduate student of Prakash, is conducting research about using the Foldscope for diagnostic testing and is helping to develop a medical Foldscope that will cost $10 and have a built-in projector allowing multiple people to view the magnification.

Most living things are rarely distributed at random, their placement being largely determined by a hierarchy of environmental factors. For this reason, standard statistical designs based on purely random sampling or systematic (e.g. grid-based) systems tend to be less efficient in recovering information about the distribution of taxa than sample designs that are purposively directed instead along deterministic environmental gradients. Ecologists have long been aware of the significance of environmental gradient based approaches to better understand community dynamics and this is reflected especially in the work of Robert Whittaker (1967)Whittaker R. H. (1967). Gradient analysis of vegetation. Biological Reviews 42: 207–264. and others. Although in practice, life-scientists intuitively sample gradients, until the early 1980s there was little formal theoretical or empirical support for such an approach, sample design being driven largely by traditional statistical methods based on probability theory incorporating random sampling.  Origins  Intensively sampled landscape- based surveys in Australia provided a reference platform for developing and testing a less logistically demanding and yet statistically acceptable gradient-based survey design that avoided the need for random or purely grid- based sampling. These initial studies Gillison, A.N. (1984). Gradient oriented sampling for resource surveys – the gradsect method. In: K.R. Myers, C.R. Margules and I. Musto (eds.) Survey Methods for Nature Conservation pp. 349–74. Proc. Workshop held at Adelaide Univ. 31 Aug. to 31 Sept. 1983. (CSIRO (Aust.) Division of Water and Land Resources, Canberra) and subsequently developed statistical support for purposive, gradient-based surveyGillison, A.N. and Brewer, K.R.W. (1985) The use of gradient directed transects or gradsects in natural resource surveys. Journal of Environmental Management 20; 103–127. provided a formalized, practical alternative to more logistically demanding traditional designs. It was here the term gradsect was coined that coupled purposive, transect sampling with a hierarchical framework of environmental gradients considered to be key determinants of species distribution.  Methodology  In constructing a gradsect, existing information is initially reviewed in which a hierarchy of environmental gradients is first identified either by visual means (maps, aerial photographs etc..) or through numerical analysis or spatial analysis of institutional or other data sources. A typical regional gradsect for example may be constructed according to a primary climate gradient (temperature, moisture, seasonality) then a secondary gradient (geomorphology, lithology, major and minor drainage systems), a tertiary gradient possibly represented by a local soil catena or local land use farming system or finer scale gradient levels representing local vegetational sequences. Through an inspection of spatial overlays of all gradients, a minimum number of sample locations is then purposively located to reflect, as far as possible, total environmental variation. For logistic and other purposes (such as improving the capacity to locate rare species) the steepest gradients are usually selected. In this way an ideal gradsect is constructed that may then be modified to accommodate logistic tradeoffs. The selection discipline requires that the fullest possible range of each hierarchical level is sampled. This commonly results in a set of progressively nested clusters of sample sites contained within the overarching primary gradient that may not reflect a linear distribution. At relatively local landscape scale, a primary gradients may be represented by salinity levels or water depth as in tidal wetlands or micro-topographic relief as in forest margins or a riparian zone. For most practical purposes, transects are commonly laid out along contours perpendicular to the main direction of the gradient. Iterative spatial analysis of environmental layers over a digital elevation model can then be used to identify areas requiring additional sampling thereby improving environmental representativeness.Gillison, A.N. (2013). Plant Functional Types and Traits at the Community, Ecosystem and World Level, in Vegetation Ecology, Second Edition (eds E. van der Maarel and J. Franklin), John Wiley & Sons, Ltd, Oxford, UK. Ch 12, pp.347-386.  Advantages and limitations  Initial studies in gradsect development revealed considerable logistic and other advantages over more traditional non-gradient- based survey designs concerned primarily with random sampling. This finding is now widely supported especially in biodiversity and other areas of environmental surveying and conservation design (see Applications next). Apart from improved logistic efficiency, the gradsect method seeks to maximise environmental representativeness which has the dual advantage of potentially improving location of rarities and enhancing spatial modelling of species distribution. Because the underlying statistical model is not based on probability theory, gradsect sampling cannot be used to estimate numbers of species or other biological attributes per unit area. For that purpose some measure of random sampling needs to be built into the sample design.  Applications  Since the publication of gradsect theory in 1984, subsequent vegetational and landscape studies in regional Australia (Austin and Heyligers 1989);Austin, M.P. and Heyligers, P.C. (1989). Vegetation survey design for conservation: gradsect sampling of forests in northeastern New South Wales; Biological Conservation 50: 13–32.

The Montana Arctic grayling, native to the upper Missouri River basin in Montana and Wyoming, is a disjunct population or subspecies of the more widespread Arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus). It occurs in fluvial (or river-dwelling) and adfluvial, lacustrine (or lake-dwelling) forms. The Montana grayling is a species of special concern in Montana and had candidate status for listing under the national Endangered Species Act. It underwent a comprehensive status review by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which in 2014 decided not to list it as threatened or endangered. Current surviving native populations in the Big Hole River and Red Rock River drainages represent approximately four percent of the subspecies' historical range. Taxonomy The scientific name of the Montana Arctic grayling, when treated as a subspecies, is Thymallus arcticus montanus. It was first described in 1874 as Thymallus montanus by fisheries biologist James W. Milner. The type specimen was collected by Acting Assistant Surgeon, George Scott Oximixon, U.S. Army near Camp Baker, Montana Territory. Camp Baker was located very close to the Smith river northwest of White Sulphur Springs in Meagher County. Milner also based his description on three specimens taken by geologist Ferdinand V. Hayden during his Geological Survey of 1872 from Willow Creek in Gallatin County, Montana. North American conservation and fisheries authorities generally do not cite the Montana grayling as a subspecies but a distinct population segment of the Arctic grayling Thymallus arcticus. Description The Montana Arctic grayling has a large, sail-like dorsal (back) fin and colorful body markings. The grayling comes in a wide array of colors. Their dorsal fins are typically fringed in red and dotted with large iridescent red, aqua, or purple spots and markings. These colorful markings are most dramatic on large grayling. Graylings’ backs are usually dark. Their sides can be black, silver, gold, or blue. A band of gold forms a border between their sides and white bellies, which are in sharp contrast to their pelvic fins striated with iridescent orange, red, or pink. The sides of the body and head can be freckled with black spots. A black slash lies on each side of the lower jaw. The iris of their eyes is often gold in color. Only their adipose, caudal (tail), pectoral, and anal fins are without much color; typically dull and gray. Range Native and introduced range of Arctic grayling, Thymallus arcticus in U.S. The historic native range of the fluvial form of Montana Arctic grayling encompasses the mainstem and tributaries of the upper Missouri river as far downstream as the Great Falls. This range was isolated from the northern populations of Arctic grayling in Canada in the post glaciation period from southern populations in Montana and Michigan. The Michigan grayling (T. a. tricolor) is now extinct. During the 1804-1806 Lewis and Clark Expedition, the explorers did not encounter the Montana grayling until they reached the Beaverhead river, a secondary tributary of the Missouri. They described the grayling as \\"white trout\\". In 1915, U.S. Bureau of Fisheries biologist, W.C. Kendall described the Montana grayling as \\"abundant\\" in the Madison, Firehole and Gibbon rivers in Yellowstone National Park. These Missouri river headwaters represent the southern extent of the historic range in Wyoming. The introduction of non-native brook, brown and rainbow trout into the upper Missouri river basin which began in the 1890s initiated a severe decline in fluvial grayling populations and range. In Howard Back's 1938 work The Waters of Yellowstone with Rod and Fly, he lamented that he was unable to find any grayling in the Madison river. By the 1950s, the only grayling in the park were lacustrine forms introduced into Grebe lake. The native range of the adfluvial form was restricted to the Red Rock Lakes at the headwaters of the Beaverhead river and several small mountain lakes in the Big Hole River drainage. The current range of fluvial Montana grayling is restricted to approximately of the Big Hole river between Melrose, Wisdom and Jackson, Montana. The highest concentrations of grayling are in the Wisdom, Montana reach of the Big Hole river. This represents approximately four percent of the grayling's original native range. In the early 20th century fishery agencies began introduction of Arctic grayling in suitable lake environments in the state. Most of these introductions were from fluvial stocks that originated in Montana, however some introductions came from Arctic grayling populations in Alaska or Canada. Grebe Lake grayling In 1921, U.S. Fish Commission personnel stocked Grebe Lake, at that time fishless, with a lacustrine form of the Montana arctic grayling. The original stocks came from Georgetown Lake near Anaconda, Montana. In an effort to re- establish grayling in western states, over 72 million grayling eggs were harvested from Grebe Lake between 1931 and 1956 and distributed to hatcheries. Most lake dwelling grayling in the west today can be genetically traced to the Grebe Lake stocks. Grebe Lake was closed to fishing until 1944 because of the fish culture operations at the lake. Life cycle Fluvial Montana grayling spend their entire life cycle in riverine environments. They make seasonal migrations within the river system for spawning, feeding and overwintering. Migrations of up to have been documented. Grayling inhabit cold, freestone streams having low to intermediate gradients. Adult fluvial grayling prefer pool habitats. In Montana, they spawn from late April to mid-May by depositing adhesive eggs over sand and gravel without excavating a redd. Eggs mature and hatch within a few weeks. Juvenile grayling are weak swimmers and prefer rearing habitat along stream margins that serve as velocity refuges, back- waters in side channels, or waters adjacent to beaver dams. Grayling in Montana typically reach maturity in their third or fourth year of life, and seldom live beyond six years. grayling, including juveniles are opportunistic feeders and routinely feed on larval, pupal and adult forms of aquatic insects (typically caddisflies, stoneflies, mayflies and aquatic diptera). They also consume adult forms of terrestrial insects (typically ants, beetles, grasshoppers and crickets) that fall into the water. Other prey include crayfish, shrimp, and other crustaceans. The aggressive feeding behavior of grayling is linked to their pattern of habitat selection whereby they often reside in deep pools with little large woody debris that allow for efficient and opportunistic feeding by this visual predator. Adfluvial forms of Montana grayling feed and overwinter in lake environments and migrate up suitable tributary streams to spawn. Conservation Fluvial Arctic grayling from Big Hole River =Candidate Conservation Agreement with Assurances= In March, 2006, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service established a Candidate Conservation Agreement with Assurances between the USFWS and several non-Federal entities whereby non-Federal property owners who voluntarily agree to manage their lands or waters to remove threats to species at risk of becoming threatened or endangered receive assurances against additional regulatory requirements should that species be subsequently listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The goal of the agreement was to secure and enhance a population of fluvial Arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus) within the upper reaches of their historic range in the Big Hole River drainage. Parties to the agreement included \\"participating landowners\\" in the Big Hole river drainage, Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks, Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation, and US Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service. =Endangered Species Act Status Assessment= On August 19, 2014, the US Fish and Wildlife Service announced that after years of status review, restoration, and pending listing decisions, the Montana Arctic grayling did not warrant listing under the Endangered Species Act due to effective conservation and partnerships. This marks a landmark decision and success story sparked in the early 1990s with the Arctic Grayling Recovery Program and Big Hole Watershed Committee and precipitated by the expansive Conservation Candidate Agreement with Assurances (CCAA). For more than 20 years ranchers, conservation groups, agencies and others worked together. Many individuals dedicated their careers or a large part of their time and energy to the benefit of the Big Hole River and its grayling. The Arctic grayling were the genesis of the Big Hole Watershed Committee in 1995 and central to its mission. =Reintroduction efforts= A Montana fluvial Arctic grayling brood program was developed to preserve the genetic integrity of Montana fluvial grayling and to provide a source of grayling for reintroduction efforts. Three fluvial brood stock populations are located at the Yellowstone River Trout Hatchery, Axolotl Chain of Lakes, and Green Hollow II Reservoir. Reintroduction efforts were initiated in 1997 in the upper Ruby River and expanded to the North and South forks of the Sun River in 1999, the lower Beaverhead River in 1999, and the Missouri River headwaters near Three Forks, Montana in 2000. Since 2002 reintroduction efforts have been focused on the upper Ruby River. In 2008 reintroductions occurred in the upper Ruby River and the North Fork of the Sun River with remote site incubators used to introduce grayling fry into the restoration reach.

Built in 1796, the building has housed a district school, private secondary school, the local Grange chapter, and town offices and civic functions. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. It presently houses town offices. Description and history The Salisbury Academy Building is located in the village center of Salisbury, at the junction of Franklin Road (New Hampshire Route 127) and Old Coach Road (the old alignment of US Route 4, whose modern alignment runs a short way to the south). It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a hip roof and clapboarded exterior. Originally a rectangular structure, its upper floor was extended in 1883 as part of a conversion of the classrooms on that floor into a single meeting space, and now hangs over the east facade, supported by posts. Under this overhang are three doorways. The left two doorways each open into small vestibules, from which access is gained to what was originally a classroom space on the ground floor. The left vestibule also gives access to a small bathroom. The right door opens to a short hall, from which a stair rises to a large meeting space on the upper floor. The two story wood frame building was built in 1796 to house a private academy of higher education in the area. The building was acquired by the town in 1806 and moved from Salisbury Heights to its present location. Its principal occupant until about 1865 was the academy, although a public district school also met on the ground floor. From 1884 to 1965 the building was used primarily by the local Grange. It now houses town offices.

This website has peaked at over 900 site visitors at the same time in 2013. Through her website, Ridgway was involved in running historical tours through her company History Tours of Britain. The first tour was in 2010, with subsequent tours until 2012. These tours were based around Hever Castle in Kent, with notable guest speakers such as Eric Ives, John Guy, Julia Fox and Elizabeth Norton. The company was closed due to Ridgway wanting to focus on her writingUK Company No. 07576296 in 2012. Ridgway has a team of book reviewers who regularly review historical books. These reviews are read by over 2500 people a month. Her first book, The Anne Boleyn Collection (2012), was an instant success with her fans and has gone on to sell over 55,000 copies in its first two years. This book is a collection of the top articles from Ridgway's website. Ridgway quickly followed her first book with a more in-depth study of the lead-up to the execution of Anne Boleyn. This book, The Fall of Anne Boleyn (2012), shows the brutal speed that Anne Boleyn was taken from power, and has been an even larger success with over 69,000 copies selling in its first two years. Putting together her detailed research into the Tudor period, Ridgway's third book, On This Day in Tudor History (2012), is larger book with 366 entries about things which happened during the reign of the Tudors. It includes notable births, deaths, coronations and interesting trivia. This book sold 12,000 copies within its first year. Ridgway's success in self-publishing led her to want to share her knowledge to other authors. With this in mind, Ridgway interviewed top self- published authors to discover what their secrets were, and what motivated them. The results are published in Interviews with Indie Authors (2012). She also created a website to share hints and tips, and to continue the work of interviewing successful authors. In 2013, Ridgway published a second instalment of The Anne Boleyn Collection. However, in this book she was able to publish articles which had only been seen by her private members-only website, making this book of more interest to her readers. In its first six months the book has sold over 3500 copies. Through her research into Anne Boleyn, Ridgway has become interested in George Boleyn, the brother of Anne Boleyn. Her upcoming book, written jointly with Clare Cherry, George Boleyn: Tudor Poet, Courtier and Diplomat, aims to flesh out George as a popular and well-liked courtier from the court of Henry VIII, continuing Ridgway's aim to clarify what is known about the Tudor period.

William Bodham Donne Early life and career Donne was born 29 July 1807; his grandfather was an eminent surgeon in Norwich. His father Edward Charles Donne, of Mattishall Hall, was also a medical practitioner. He was educated at Bury St Edmunds Grammar School, taught for two years by Benjamin Heath Malkin. There he formed lasting friendships with James Spedding, Edward FitzGerald, and John Mitchell Kemble, the Anglo-Saxon scholar. His friendship in after life with the Kemble family helped to turn his attention to the drama. He went to Caius College, Cambridge, but scruples against taking the religious tests then required prevented him from graduating. He was a Cambridge Apostle, and a member of the Sterling Club. After he left Cambridge, the choice of a career proved troublesome for Donne; and he hardly solved the problem, well connected as he was. He asked friends to find him literary work. He spent time at Mattishall in Norfolk, on Anne Bodham's estate; she was his great-aunt, and a cousin of William Cowper. There he married, and took up periodical journalism. In 1846 he moved to Bury St. Edmunds, for the sake of the education of his sons, and came to know John William Donaldson, then head-master of the school. Other friends were William Taylor, Henry Crabb Robinson, Bernard Barton, Thomas Manning, and George Borrow. Examiner of Plays In 1852 Donne declined the editorship of the Edinburgh Review, but the same year he accepted the librarianship of the London Library. In 1857 he resigned to become Examiner of Plays, in succession to his friend Kemble, a post in the Lord Chamberlain's Office, where he had previously acted as Kemble's deputy. He held the position till 1874, when he was succeeded by E. F. S. Pigott. From 1865 the Examiner of Plays, in company with the Inspector of Theatres (an appointed architect) began to visit backstage areas, which were found in some cases to be nasty and insanitary. Donne gave evidence in 1866 to a parliamentary committee, on his duties in the Lord Chamberlain's Office. They included inspection of the physical premises of theatres, and enforcement of building improvements. Seven plays had been refused a licence since 1857, a decision taken at the level of Lord Chamberlain. Plays of Jack Sheppard and Oliver Twist had been closed while running. As a censor, Donne was openly hostile to French drama and its influence. His approach was later criticised (in 1886) by William Archer, who found it \\"alternately tyrannical and futile\\". The parliamentary enquiry in fact supported the line taken in censorship at the time, and suggested it might be extended. Archer claimed that John Hollingshead and Tom Taylor as witnesses had dissented; but they did not oppose censorship as such.James F. Stottlar, A Victorian Stage Censor: The Theory and Practice of William Bodham Donne, Victorian Studies Vol. 13, No. 3 (Mar. 1970) , pp. 253–282, at p. 254 note 2. Published by: Indiana University Press. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/3826472 One of the firm lines Donne took was against stage representation of Bible stories, and discussion of theology. He defended, to the parliamentary enquiry, the permission granted to perform certain operas, considered \\"unsuitable\\", on the grounds that the words were not very audible, and in a foreign language. It has been found surprising that he did not object to the song The Wearing of the Green, in a Dion Boucicault play set during the Irish Rebellion of 1798. In fact Donne cited the play, Arrah-na-Pogue, in a short list of contemporary works he thought were likely to last, along with others by Edward Bulwer, Sheridan Knowles, John Westland Marston, Thomas Noon Talfourd, and Tom Taylor.James F.

Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/3826472 Death and views Donne died on 20 June 1882. He was a liberal in politics, supported the repeal of the corn laws, and spoke on behalf of Lajos Kossuth. Works Donne's writings were mainly in the periodicals of the day. He became a contributor to the leading reviews, including the Edinburgh Review, Quarterly Review, Fraser's Magazine, and the British and Foreign Review, of which Kemble was editor. He was a frequent contributor to the Saturday Review. He also wrote some articles in Bentley's Quarterly Review (1859–60), when it was edited by Robert Cecil. A classical scholar, Donne published in 1852 Old Roads and New Roads, involving classical literature and modern history. His Essays on the Drama, collected from periodicals, were published in 1858, and reached a second edition in 1863. He wrote the volumes Euripides and Tacitus for the series Ancient Classics for English Readers (William Blackwood and Sons). As a theatre critic, Donne expressed reservation about contemporary trends, in the direction of historical accuracy, and towards concrete representation rather than relying on imagination. In 1867 Donne edited the Letters of George III to Lord North. Other works were contributions to William Smith's classical dictionaries, such as Smith's A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography, and selections from classical writers for John Weale. Family Donne on 15 November 1830 married Catharine Hewitt, daughter of Charles Hewitt who was an attorney in Norwich, and on her mother' side niece of John Johnson, Cowper's relation. Their eldest son, Charles Edward Donne, became vicar of Faversham, Kent, and married first, Mildred, daughter of John Mitchell Kemble; secondly, Augusta, daughter of W. Rigden of Faversham. The other children were William Mowbray and Frederick Church (a major in the army), and three daughters.

They first emerged as a spontaneous wave in late April at the nation's largest Renault factory. When the Communist Party (PCF) joined them it led to the May crisis which saw all Communist officials expelled from the national government. The peak wave in September was more generalized, more directly associated with the Cominform, and explicitly denounced the Marshall Plan. Soon there were 3 million strikers. 23,371,000 working days were lost to strikes in 1947, against 374,000 in 1946, but the movement stayed less important in Italy, where the Communists were also excluded from the government. In May, the Communist ministers in effect left the government, ending tripartisme, and at the end of the year, the CGT divided into a reformist minority and a pro-Atlantic-creating Workers' Force (FO). Although created in December 1944, the Compagnies Républicaines de Sécurité (CRS) had their first real mission of policing with the strikes of November–December 1947, all under the leadership of Minister of the Interior Jules Moch (SFIO). History =Early strikes= The strikes begin on 25 April 1947 at the Renault factory at Boulogne-Billancourt, nationalized in 1946. The day before, the Ramadier cabinet had reduced the daily bread ration from 300 to 250 grams. The plant employed 30,000 men; the General Confederation of Labour (CGT) claimed 17,000 members. The strike was started, among other things, by the Trotskyist Pierre Bois, an activist of the communist Union and a founder of Workers' Struggle, and anarchists (Gil Devillard of the Anarchist Federation) and international Communist Party members (PCI, Trotskyist). The importance of the intervention of the PCI in this movement was clear in a magazine article (Cavalcades), No. 65 of 26 June 1947, titled \\"A teacher, an engineer, a journalist, leaders of the Fourth International, tomorrow could paralyze France.\\". The strike did not, at first, have the support of the French Communist Party (PCF ) and the General Confederation of Labour (CGT). The PCF is indeed in government, as part of tripartisme. Plaisance, a secretary of the CGT, said outside the factory: \\"This morning, an anarcho-Hitlero-Trotskyists band wanted to blow up the factory.\\" The CGT then excused: \\"The strike arms the trusts\\". Despite this communist opposition, the strike quickly brought in more than 10 000 workers. Eugene Hénaff, secretary general of the CGT Metallurgy, was booed at Boulogne-Billancourt. On 8 May, the government provides 3 francs increase. On 9 May, the CGT voted two-thirds for return to work, but some remained on strike paralyzing the factory. The strike ceased on May 15, the government granted a bonus of 1600 francs and 900 francs an advance for any and all employees. =End of tripartisme and extension of the social movement= The strikes spread. With an inflation rate of over 60% and rationing still in force, the black market remained important and living conditions were difficult, particularly since France struggled to meet its energy needs. On 5 May 1947, the Communist ministers were excluded from government by Paul Ramadier. From that moment, the PCF and CGT supported the social movement, which extended to Citroën, SNCF, banks, department stores, EDF, and Peugeot, Berliet, Michelin, etc. The main reasons for the strikes were demand for higher wages, but in the broader context of the formalization of the Cold War. In June, a wave of insurrectionist strikes protested against the Marshall Plan. =November strikes= On 10 November 1947, after the victory of the Rally of the French People (RPF Gaullist) in the municipal election in October, a vast movement of insurrectional strikes that shook the country for several months, started in Marseilles, protesting against tram face increases. Four strikers were charged following the demonstrations . To free them, 4,000 demonstrators entered the courthouse, and then went to City Hall. They insulted and defenestrates lawyer Gaullist Michel Carlini, who had become alderman defeating by one vote the Communist Jean Cristofol. The protesters then attacked at night shady bars near the Opéra. The young communist worker Vincent Voulant was killed by the mafia clan Guerini. At his funeral, on November 14, three out of four employees in Marseilles were on strike. The strike spread to miners; on 17 November, 10,000 of them stopped work in protest against the dismissal of Leon Delfosse, communist president of the coalminers in the Nord coalfield. The next day, more than 80,000 were on strike. On 19 November the strike resumed at Renault and Citroën, then spread to the National Education, the construction trade, steelworkers, dockworkers, and all the public services. In the department of Seine, the teachers went on strike for two weeks, despite the National Union of Teachers (SNI) refusing to support the movement. On 29 November, 30,000 striking mining, railroad and textile workers demonstrated in Saint-Étienne. Armed with iron bars, they face the CRS, which was newly created by the Interior Minister, Jules Moch (SFIO), who also appealed to the army and the 11th Parachute Shock Regiment Shock (armed wing of the SDECEE) to break the strikes. The creation of these riot police was to ensure the loyalty of police \\"relocating\\" the maintenance of order (it uses of police from across the country, not just in the locations concerned, to quell the riots) . In the North, the military nevertheless ensured that they would intervene in cases of violence, refraining if miners are limited to stopping working. In Saint-Étienne, protesters took the advantage. They rode on three military vehicles which were armed with machine guns - the officers refused to fire on them - they got hold of weapons from soldiers (they discreetly returned them afterwards) and forced the police to evacuate the station. 100 were injured. Among the miners, there were 100 sackings, 1000 suspensions and 500 forced displacement of \\"gueules noires\\" (miners) from one mine to another. Debates December, legislation and union split. On the night of 2 to 3 December 1947, activists of the Federation of Pas-de-Calais CGT sabotaged the Paris-Tourcoing rail link by unbolting two rails. This caused a train derailment near Arras at 3 o'clock in the morning, which left 16 people dead and 50 wounded. The general secretary of the PCF, Maurice Thorez, was concerned about the radicalization of the movement, as shown in the reports of SDECEE. Saboteurs activists believed that the train was carrying CRS to support non-strikers from Arras, supported by the Gaullist militants. The government was secretly negotiating with the PCF, exchanging immunity against four activists supporting the resumption of work. On 30 June 1953, the Supreme Court delivered a leading case, considering that the train was still responsible because it had, given the social climate, expected this kind of acts. In March 1954, the case rebounded : former MP René Camphin, formerly \\"Colonel Baudouin\\" of the FTP and former leader of the Federation of Pas-de-Calais in 1947, was found dead in Paris. Refusing to criticize before the central committee his superior, Auguste Lecoeur, former deputy secretary of state and responsible for the sabotage, he had committed suicide. =Discussions in December 1947= On 4 December 1947, after extremely violent discussions, the National Assembly voted a law on the \\"defense of the Republic and the freedom to work.\\" (Three years later, the arrest of Dehaene State Council consecrated the constitutional right to strike. On 9 December 1947, the central strike committee consisting of the CGT federations ordered return to work. Ten days later, a split divided the CGT, with a majority close to the PCF and led by Benoît Frachon, while the reformist minority, led by Léon Jouhaux, founded the CGT-Workers' Force. The strike of 1947 at Renault also denounced the repression of the Malagasy Uprising. The PCF had been the only members of the French government to denounce the empire's atrocities in Madagascar, and with their expulsion the other parties authorized an even more ruthless counter-insurgency. Strikes also affected the railway from Dakar to Niger, claiming the same rights as their French counterparts. Covert action by the Central Intelligence Agency was later revealed to have been a factor in the strike. CGT-Worker's Force was initiated with the financial support of American unions (including the AFL-CIO), and this funding was coordinated by CIA operative Irving Brown. Even earlier, the CIA began funding and arming the Guerini crime family to assault Communist picket lines and harass union officials in Marseilles. Several murders of striking workers were traced to the Guerinis at this time.Jill Jonnes, Hep-cats, Narcs, and Pipe Dreams: A History of America's Romance with Illegal Drugs (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1996) p.170-171David E.

Zurkow (born December 19, 1962) is an American visual artist based in New York City who works with media technology, animation and video. Some of the less traditional mediums are known to be dinners, life science and bio materials. Her subject matter includes individual narratives, environmental concerns, and reflections on the relation between species, or between humans, animals, plants and the weather. Her artworks have been seen in solo exhibitions at DiverseWorks in Houston Texas and at FACT in Liverpool. Zurkow is the recipient of a Creative Capital grant and has had fellowships from the Guggenheim and the Rockefeller Foundation. Career Zurkow currently resides in Brooklyn, New York. Her experience as a faculty member at NYU Tisch's Interactive Telecommunications Program coupled with her degree in Fine Arts have equipped her with a proper understanding of fine arts media, installation, video art, and semiotics. Her wide usage of \\"web work\\" began in the mid 1990s, where her work with animation, gif animation and Flash v1.0 was treated as more of a step up from her previous work with making \\"experimental videos, films and graphic design projects. In the last four years she has stuck to more of a rotoscoping technique, frame by frame on top of video, and well as a more standard cartooning of \\"squash and stretch, tweening of shapes, and purely invented behavioral cycles. She was an Eyebeam resident in 2009. Works Marina Zurkow talks with NYAP in her Brooklyn Garden Much of Zurkow's recent work is informed by both a sense of impending environmental catastrophe and a variety of art historical sources. This includes the series \\"Crossing the Waters\\" (2006–2009), a collection of digital animations inspired by the threat of climate change. The same concerns can be seen in the more recent series \\"Friends and Enemies\\" (2011-ongoing), which includes animations, prints (both digital and letterpress), and performances. One work in the \\"Friends and Enemies\\" series is Mesocosm (Northumberland, UK) (2011), a 146-hour, black-and-white looping animation set in the titular location. Zurkow has also incorporated both food and performance into recent works. This includes \\"Outside the Work: A Tasting of Hydrocarbons and Geological Time\\" (2013), a performance/meal at Boston University's 808 Gallery and the Center for Energy and Environmental Research in the Human Sciences at Rice University, which used food as a means to prompt reflection on humanity's effect on the environment (particularly, in this case, relating to petroleum). Additionally, Zurkow has also worked with several artists and other colleagues to collaborate on several projects. In 2006, she worked with Katie Salen and Nancy Nowacek, on the work, Karaoke Ice. Later on, in 2011, she also began work on a set of instructions for 2013, titled, Survival Challenges in collaboration with Ruth Ozeki, Oliver Kellhammer, Una Chaudhuri, Fritz Ertl, and a PTSD specialist.

History  The current history can be traced back to the end of the 16th century when the area was a part of Singh Dynasty and was ruled by Vikramjeet Singh of Sarmera. During the Mughal period of 1571-1611, It was an hugh empire and was ruled by Vikramjeet Singh of Sarmera. Then after his death the empire was in 1614 the empire was destroyed due to civil war and heavy rainfall. Then in 1720 the descendants of Vikramjeet Singh of Sarmera established Sarmera Estate. In 1770, the East India Company defeated Sarmera Estate and occupied the village. Then the ruler of Sarmera Estate, Bhim Lal Singh of Sarmera broke his estate into many small parts. Then this area became a part of the Presidency during the British Raj in 1778. In the early 19th century, Umaidpur became a part of the newly created province of Bihar. The regional office was Harsingpur. Kothi and T.I. Pal was the officer representative on behalf of the British. Throughout British rule, all the villages were part of the estates run by independent Zamindars, calling themselves a Raja, or directly ruled by the British Raj. The arid lands of Umaidpur was part of the Narhan Estate and the Jaintpur Estate, Muzaffarpur. The British cultivated indigo, sugarcane, poppy, and tobacco. Land revenue was collected with the help of Jeth Rayaits for the Tehsildar (revenue collector). Sukkan Roy was the Jeth Rayait for Narhan Estate, whereas Ram Pratap Roy was the Jeth Rayait for the Jaintpur Estate. Chullahai Hazari was the Brahil, whose responsibility was to inform villagers to come at the Jeth Rayait's house to pay land revenues. When the British left India, they sold all their land possessions to Janak Kishore Prasad, including Harsinghpur Kothi. Presently, Umaidpur is the home of a former Mukhiya (1994-1996; 2001-2005), Sukhdeo Roy, the son of Sukkan Roy.  Demographics  The total land of the Umaidpur village is around 300 bighas.

He is a professor and founding chair of the Department of Environmental and Occupational Health at the Florida International University, Miami, Florida, US. Dr. Roy served as a member to the International Agency for Research on Cancer Working Group in 1999 and 2005 of the World Health Organization in preparing Iarc Monographs On The Evaluation Of Carcinogenic Risks To Humans: Combined Estrogen−Progestogen Contraceptives And Combined Estrogen− Progestogen Menopausal Therapy. He has published more than 100 peer reviewed papers. He has edited a book published by Springer, and an encyclopedia published by Elsevier. Some of his articles are most-cited in the field of estrogen carcinogenesis.  Economy  The economy is principally agrarian. Farming is the main occupation of villagers. There are two brick chimneys in the village. The recent trend has been that many of younger generation are migrating to big cities, such as Patna, Mumbai, Surat, Ludhiana, Kolkata, looking for employment. As a result of this, the income of individual household has gone up and living standards of individual family have become better. =Agriculture= From Imperial Gazetteer of India, Volume 11, it appears that sugar-cane, indigo and poppy were grown in the land of this and adjacent villages during and before British rule. Between 1800 and early nineteenth century, the cultivation of indigo plants (Indigofera tinctoria, also known as I. sumatrana) and poppy (a flowering plant in the subfamily Papaveroideae of the family Papaveraceae) was more prevalent. Indigo dye made in India was exported by British to the Greeks and the Romans, where it was valued as a luxury product. Maharaja of Darbhanga abandoned the cultivation of indigo around 1901, because the fall in the price of indigo dye, due to the competition of artificial substitutes, has caused many other factories to abandon. The chief feature of the indigo industry in Umaidpur regions, as compared with the other indigo-growing tracts in North Bihar, was the large area cultivated direct by the factories themselves in the Samastipur subdivision. The plant, when cut, was fermented in masonry vats and oxidized either by beating or by currents of steam. The dye thus precipitated was boiled and dried into cakes. Due to the fall in the value of indigo dye, the factories have taken to the growing of ordinary crops. The principal exports were rice, indigo, gram, pulses, linseed, mustard seed, saltpetre, tobacco, hides, and ghee; and the principal imports were rice and other food-grains, salt, kerosene oil, gunny-bags, coal and coke, European cotton piece-goods, and raw cotton. Gram, pulses, and oilseeds are chiefly sent to Calcutta, and rice and other food-grains to Saran and Muzaffarpur. The imports of food- grains came for the most part from Bhagalpur and Nepal, coal and coke from Burdwary kerosene oil from the Twenty-four Parganas, and salt and piece-goods from Calcutta. Most fertile part of the village, use to produce all the most valuable rabi and bhadoi crops. In the low-lying areas, the main crop grown is winter rice, though in some parts good rabi crops are also raised on the lands. Rabi and Bhadoi crops were grown from 1800 until recently (1980). Villages like Umaidpur were chiefly dependent on the Aghani (or winter) rabi and bhadoi harvests. The village land falls into two classes: Bhith (uplands) and Dhanhar (low lands where water logging occurred during rainy season). Bhith was further classified as saliferous land or usher (soils in which salinity is mainly due to accumulation of alkali salts are called alkali soils) was found in patches in the outer area between good land and low-lying land. Nunia caste from the neighbouring village, Nauachak, used to extract saltpetere in the summer after rabi crop from these lands for their living. In these lands small farmers grew mainly 'Marua, also called mandua, nachini or Ragi' or Finger Millets (Eleusine coracana), Kauni (foxtail milet) and Sama (kutaki or little milet). In Bhith land, wheat, maize, and miscellaneous food- grains which consisted chiefly of khesari, rahari, masuri, urd, mung, janera, and oats. Food-crops grown also included potatoes, and suthni (Dioscorea fasciculate). The chief non-food crops are oilseeds. Tobacco and chilies are cultivated as commercial crops. Of the other non-food crops, kharhaul or thatching-grass was the most valuable, but now these lands are used for growing paddy.  Governance  Umaidpur became a part of Samastipur district, when Darbhanga district was split into three districts in 1972. Before British, the mention of this district in the Imperial Gazetteer of India (volume 11) goes back to A. D. 1400. When this area was taken over by the British in 1765, it was included in Silbah Bihar and formed with the greater part of Muzaffarpur District, the Sarkar of Tirhut. Bihar was retained as an independent revenue division, and in 1782 Tirhut (including Hajipur) was made into a Collectorate. In 1875 Tirhut was divided into the two existing Districts of Muzaffarpur and Darbhanga. The governance of the Umiadpur village is run through community development block program administered by a Morwa Block Development Officer, Morwa Dakshin Panchayat headed by Mukhiya, and a local administrative unit at the village level. The law enforcement is provided by Tajpur Police Station. The village is under the civial jurisdiction of Samastipur district. Umaidpur village is a part of Morwa (Vidhan Sabha constituency) and the current member of this constituency of Bihar Legislative Assembly is Vidya Sagar Singh Nishad of JD(U). Lok Sabha Constituency of Umaidpur village is No. 22 Ujiarpur (Lok Sabha constituency). The Lok Sabha member is Nityanand Rai, Bharatiya Janta Party.

It has been called the Kolb Concerto.  Structure  : \\\\relative c { \\\\key d \\\\major \\\\tempo \\"Allegro maestoso\\" 4\\\\f r16. d,32-. cis16.-. d32-.  e16.-. d32-. cis16.-. d32-. e16.-. d32-. cis16.-. b32-. a8-. a'-. r4 } The concerto has the usual fast-slow-fast structure and lasts around 26 minutes. The movements are:  Background  This violin concerto was first published by Breitkopf & Härtel in an edition by Albert Kopfermann in 1907. Two sources are known for the concerto: a full score from the collection of Aloys Fuchs and a set of parts in Paris made by Eugene Sauzay in 1837 for his teacher (and also father-in- law) Pierre Baillot from the lost autograph (then in the possession of François Habeneck). The source of Fuchs' copy is unknown, and he himself was not sure of the work's authenticity: its layout with the solo violin part on the bottom staff is very uncharacteristic of Mozart, where the solo instrument is usually on the top staff. However, a paper scrap in Sauzay's copy lists the instruments in exactly the same order and the same horn solmisation found in Mozart's authentic violin concerti, supporting the work's authenticity: this was noted by Robert D. Levin. As to how the autograph (if it was truly that) ended up in Habeneck's possession, Mozart may have sold the autograph privately in Paris and the husband of Sauzay's friend Marie Bigot de Moragues had connections to Viennese music publishers. Three cadenzas are found in the Paris copy; two may be Baillot's and the third Sauzay's. Fuchs' copy also had different cadenzas, which Kopfermann suppressed, considering them inauthentic. The two copies differ in some places, and a 37-bar ending in Fuchs' copy corresponds to a short 7-bar ending in the Paris copy: this is seen by some to correspond to Mozart's 1778 statement \\"If I have time, I shall rearrange some of my violin concertos, and shorten them\\". The concerto was unknown to Ludwig Ritter von Köchel and hence it is absent from the first edition of the Köchel catalogue. Paul von Waldersee placed it as K. 271a in the second edition, dating it to 16 July 1777. It was first performed on 4 November 1907 in Dresden. After its first publication and performance, scholars took sides regarding its authenticity. Georges de Saint-Foix did not doubt the work, but believed the published version was a later revision by Mozart dating to 1779 or 1780. Others thought that the work had some content deriving from Mozart but was finished by another person. Rudolf Gerber published another edition in 1934, considering it genuine and noted a theme in the Finale's epilogue to be similar to a theme from the \\"Gavotte joyeuse\\" from Mozart's own ballet music to Les petits riens, K. 299b. He also noted similarities between the opening themes of this concerto and the authentic K. 211. The concerto was recorded by Yehudi Menuhin in 1932, with George Enescu's cadenzas, and Menuhin recorded it again in stereo in 1962 and 1974-5. Alfred Einstein renumbered the work as K. 271i, due to the insertion of new works bearing the numbers K. 271b to K. 271h in the catalogue. He believed that the work was based on a rough sketch of a violin concerto by Mozart from 1777, but states that the original form of the work cannot easily be reconstructed. The uncharacteristic number of passages for the solo violin in the high register, in pizzicato (in the second movement), and in double stops in tenths were considered by Einstein to be 19th-century additions. Friedrich Blume, on the other hand, was firmly in favour of the work's authenticity, stating that \\"not one passage allows of any room for doubt in regard to themes, harmony, rhythm, construction and orchestration\\". He noted similarities to violin movements of authentic Mozart serenades and divertimenti, stated that some unusual usage of violin technique was not sufficient grounds for doubting the work's authenticity, and criticized Einstein's ideas regarding the concerto. Carl Bär published a paper in 1963 that came down in favour of Mozart's authorship, noting that a passage in Joachim von Schiedenhofen's diary for 25 July 1777 stated that a Mozart symphony, a violin concerto (played by Mozart), and a flute concerto were rehearsed at Gusset's. Bär believed that the violin concerto was K. 271a/271i, and also identified this with the violin concerto Leopold referred to as \\"the concerto you [Wolfgang] wrote for Kolb\\" on 3 August 1778. He ruled out the five certainly authentic violin concerti as possibilities, as they were written in 1775, and Leopold had stated on 13 August 1778 in a letter that Count Czernin (who had been in Salzburg since April 1775) had never heard the violin being played by Kolb. Kolb was originally thought to be Franz Xavier Kolb (1731–1782), but Bär suspected it to actually have been his older son Johann Andreas (born sometime between 1746-8?). Bär hypothesized that he had been given the concerto by Mozart just before leaving Salzburg, thus dating the concerto to between 16 June (performance of the second Lodron Nachtmusik, K. 287/271h) and 26 July 1777 (Nannerl's name day). Bär also believed the dating of the manuscript (\\"Salisburgo li 16 di Luglio 1777\\") to be another point in favour of the work's authenticity, as it was in a similar form to those on most contemporary autographs and was in a time that the author of the heading would not have known a violin concerto had probably been written. But Ernest Hess noted that the work had compositional errors, un-Mozartian phrases, weaknesses in instrumentation, and sequences without meaning that Mozart himself had parodied in his A Musical Joke, K. 522, all speaking against Mozart being the author of this concerto. The sixth edition of the Köchel catalogue kept the work as K. 271i, copying the third edition's remarks, but referencing Hess' doubts as to its authenticity. Christoph- Hellmut Mahling asked in 1978 if the work could be by someone else and was copied by Mozart, but noted that most questions regarding the work remained unsolved. He edited the volume of the Neue Mozart-Ausgabe containing this work (and the also doubtful Sinfonia Concertante for Four Winds, K. 297b/Anh.C 14.01) in 1980, placing it in the section for doubtful works, and included all the cadenzas in the original copies. Hermann Schmid called the work thoroughly un-Mozartian based on matters of form and technique, saying \\"I find in the entire Concerto K. 271i no music which I in earnest would put in a claim for Mozart\\", and dating the composition to the 1780s to a composer who used different forms and techniques to Mozart. In the 2001 Mozart-Jahrbuch, Mahling reviewed earlier published information and gave new commentary and information. He found the concerto to have not much in common with those of Baillot and much more in common with those of Rodolphe Kreutzer, but also noted that the frequent leaps into the high register (reaching up to D7) without many musical reasons was characteristic of the French composition school of the Paris Conservatoire a little later than the customary dating of this concerto: this school included Baillot and Kreutzer. The unusual usage of pizzicato in the second movement has a precedent in Baillot's Sinfonia Concertante for two violins in D minor (Op. 38, written in 1816). The tempo marking \\"Allegro maestoso\\" is also characteristic of contemporary French concerti, while the majestic beginning of the concerto in dotted rhythms has much in common with the French overture form. Mahling thus thought that, if the concerto was an arrangement, it was most likely one of Baillot or Kreutzer dating from around 1830. He distinguished five possibilities for the actual provenance of the concerto: #Mozart, but dated later; #a Mozart arrangement of another's violin concerto; #another's arrangement of a Mozart violin concerto; #a false attribution or thought attribution to Mozart for a later unrelated work by an unknown composer; #a simple forgery (viz. the Adélaïde Concerto, a later violin concerto forgery also attributed to Mozart) Richard Kapp stated that players from the Czech Philharmonic Chamber Orchestra laughed when playing the piece, because a melody from the third movement is similar to that of the Czech Christmas carol Půjdem spolu do Betléma. This raises the possibility of the concerto having been written by a Czech composer. The true provenance of the K. 271a/271i concerto remains unknown and debated. All known recordings use the longer ending from Fuchs' copy; but only that of Jean- Jacques Kantorow uses the cadenzas originally found in the copies.

The Sinhalese translation of his work,Jānakī-haraṇa, gave credence to the belief that Kumāradāsa was King Kumāradhātusena (513-522 A.D.) of Sri Lanka but scholars do not make any such identification even though the poet at the end of his poem says that his father, Mānita, a commander of the rearguard of the Sinhalese King Kumāramaṇi, died in battle on the day he was born and that his maternal uncles, Megha and Agrabodhi, brought him up. Rajasekhara, who lived around 900 A.D., in his Kāvyamīmāmsā refers to the poet as born blind - मेधाविरुद्रकुमारदासादयः जात्यन्धाः. There is also a tradition that this poem was written by Kalidasa. Kumāradāsa came after Kalidasa and lived around 500 A.D., later than Bhāravi but before Māgha. While writing Jānakī-haraṇa, he certainly had before him Raghuvaṃśa of Kalidasa.

He was a deputy from 1838 to 1848, and minister of Agriculture and Commerce in the second cabinet of Odilon Barrot (2 June 1849 to 31 October 1849). Monarchy Victor Ambroise, vicomte de Lanjuinais, was born in Paris on 5 November 1802. His father was Jean Denis, comte Lanjuinais (1753–1827). His brother was Paul-Eugène Lanjuinais (1799–1812 ), a peer of France. Victor Lanjuinais studied law and was admitted to the bar. He was a friend of Gustave d'Eichthal, an author who was sympathetic to Africans and advocated mixed marriages to produce offspring with the complementary qualities of the black and white races. When John Stuart Mill visited Paris in 1830 he spent much time with Lanjuinais and Eichthal, finding the views of these young men refreshing and encouraging. Lanjuinais edited a multi-volume collection of the works of his father, and contributed a biographical preface to the work in 1832. On 17 February 1838 Victor Lanjuinais was elected deputy for the third college of Loire-Inférieure (Pont-Rousseau). He sat on the center-left. He was reelected in March 1839, July 1842 and August 1846. He was a correspondent of the liberal thinker Alexis de Tocqueville. Lanjuinais belonged to a small group of deputies who followed Tocqueville in supporting the Orleans monarchy while agitating for democratic reforms. He was moderately opposed to the policy of François Guizot, and voted for the electoral reform proposal in 1847, but refused to join the Campagne des banquets (banquet campaign). Second Republic Lanjuinais addressing the Assembly in 1849, by Honoré Daumier After the February Revolution of 1848 Lanjuinais was elected on 23 April 1848 to represent Loire-Inférieure in the Constituent Assembly. As Secretary and Member of the Finance Committee, he was a strong opponent of socialism, advocating a laissez-faire approach to economic issues. He was against paper money, and proposed to deal with the deficit by consolidating Treasury debts and issuing a loan for 200 million. After heated debate, his views prevailed. He was then charged with various important reports on finance issues. Lanjuinais was a member of the committee of inquiry into the events of 15 May and 23 June 1848, and sided with most of his colleagues in favor of repression. He supported the motion for voluntary dissolution of the Constituent Assembly after the adoption of the electoral law. The royalist purists in Loire-Inférieure withdrew their support from Lanjuinais in the Legislative Assembly elections of 13 and 14 May 1849, and he was not reelected. He had retired to the country when he learned on 2 June 1849 that he had been appointed Minister of Commerce and Agriculture in the cabinet headed by Odilon Barrot. In by-elections on 8 July 1849 Lanjuinais ran as Conservative candidate and was elected to the Assembly for the Seine. As Minister of Commerce he was involved in suppressing the system of quarantines of the Levant. He wanted to end the monopoly of the Parisian bakery, but this decision was not confirmed by his successor. For three months Lanjuinais was also acting Minister of Public Education and Worship. The cabinet to which he belonged was dissolved on 31 October 1849, and he refused to participate in its successor. He did participate in several important committees of the Assembly. Second Empire Lanjuinais was opposed to the coup of 2 December 1851, and was briefly detained at the Château de Vincennes. He returned to private life, and in 1857 refused to be a candidate to the Legislative body. On 1 June 1863 he was elected as an independent candidate for the second district of Loire-Inférieure. He sat with the Orleanist third party. Victor Ambrose Lanjuinais died in Paris on 1 January 1869. He was aged 66.

The park also has two later houses: the Coffin-Howland House, which may contain portions of Congdon's carriage house, is fire-damaged and fenced off, and the Howland House, built in 1890, is located near Brock Avenue, and is dominated by its large carriage house and stable. By the late 1890s, development had encroached on the area, and the city of New Bedford was purchasing land for use as public parks. It acquired the Hazelwood property in 1902. It hired Warren Manning, who had previously worked for Frederick Law Olmsted, to plan the park.

This continuing trend away from the cover album genre would reach its limit with his next studio release, Right from the Heart, which only had original material. A Special Part of Me made its first appearance on Billboard magazine's Top LPs & Tapes chart in the issue dated March 10, 1984, and remained there for 19 weeks, peaking at number 157.. It also made it to number 45 during a three- week run on the UK album chart that began on September 15 of that year. \\"Love Won't Let Me Wait\\" had its chart debut on Billboard magazine's list of the 100 most popular R&B; singles in the US in the issue dated February 25, 1984, where it peaked at number 32 over the course of 12 weeks.. The March 24 issue marked its first appearance on the magazine's list of the 50 most popular Adult Contemporary records in the US, where it spent 13 weeks and reached number 14.. The next issue, dated March 31, saw its debut on the \\"Bubbling Under the Hot 100\\" chart, where it got as high as number 106.. Another song from the album, \\"Simple\\", began a 12-week run on the R&B; chart two months later, in the May 19 issue, that took the song to number 43. The Adult Contemporary chart in the following issue, dated May 26, was its next debut and the beginning of a 16-week stay, during which time it made it to number six. It also enjoyed eight weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 that began the following month, in the issue dated June 23, giving Mathis a number 81 hit, and reached number eight on the Canadian AC chart. The fact that the front cover photograph was taken at the Carlyle Hotel in Miami, Florida, and the choice of pastels for both the album design and the clothing Mathis wears in the photo might suggest that the look was inspired by the influential hit show Miami Vice, but the television series debuted on September 16, 1984.—eight months after this album was released. On January 15, 2013, Funkytowngrooves released an expanded edition of the album on compact disc that included two additional versions of \\"Simple\\" that came out in 1984 on a separate 12-inch single.

It has a membership of more than 100 Norwegian and British companies, as well as a large number of personal members. The NBCC was founded in 1906 and represents companies and individuals from Norway, the UK and other countries, who wish to be part of the business community. Its mission is to promote trade and investment between Norway and the UK, and to provide a professional and social arena for members and business people. The NBCC works closely with government bodies and other trade organisations, including the Norwegian Embassy, Innovation Norway and other bilateral Chambers of Commerce.  Foundation  After the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905, Norwegians felt a need to unite. Norwegian business people outside the country felt the need to create cooperative organisations which could support them in their work. Two months after Haakon VII ascended the throne of Norway in November 1905, Norwegian businessmen proposed the creation of a Norwegian Chamber of Commerce in London. Johan Jørgensen was the primary advocate and Norway's consul general; Jørgensen and his business partner, William Johnson, were among the few Norwegians engaged in trade in London with most of the rest representing Norwegian shipping interests. Jørgensen invited fellow Norwegians to form a Chamber of Commerce in January 1906, and the founding meeting was held in London the following April. 21 Norwegians attended, and Thode Fagelund was named the first president of the NBCC. = Timeline = Bibliography * * References External links * Category:1906 establishments in the United Kingdom ","title":"Norwegian-British Chamber of Commerce"},{"id":"42192938","text":"Macclesfield railway station was a short lived railway station serving the town of Macclesfield in Cheshire, England. It was opened in 1869 by the Macclesfield, Bollington and Marple Railway (MB&M;) - a joint line constructed and operated by the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MS&L;) and North Staffordshire Railways (NSR) - and closed in 1873. The MB&M; was built with the intention of connecting to the main London and North Western Railway (LNWR) / NSR line between Manchester and Stoke however there were numerous difficulties to be overcome; the route through town, the reluctance of the local authority to allow the railway to bridge over the River Bollin and the lack of co-operation from the LNWR to agree to a site for a station on the Manchester - Stoke line. The board of the MB&M; therefore decided to open a temporary station on land they already owned to allow services to commence. The station, known simply as Macclesfield, opened on 2 August 1869 and was the southern terminus of the line. From there passengers made a short walk to the joint LNWR/NSR station at to catch services to and from the south. Four years elapsed before a route for the line through the town was constructed and a new joint NSR/MS&L; station at built. The new Central station opened on 1 July 1873 and the old station closed the same day. Following closure the old station buildings were used as stables for the horses working in the MB&M; goods yard until the buildings were demolished in 1947. In 1919 they had seen temporary use, once again, as a passenger station when rebuilding work of the section of line to Central station was undertaken.

In 2015, it was stated that a total of 78 episodes were in production for the series, and they were expected to be released in blocks from 2015 onward in a multi-year deal. Critical reception The New York Times gave the first episode a positive review stating that the show \\"is nicely drawn, and San Lorenzo is populated with some appealingly odd young residents, human and otherwise.\\" Moreover, they praised the humour stating that it was \\"relatively sophisticated (you could write a psychological treatise on Dulcinea, who has modeled her life on a somewhat vacuous book of epigrams), but not so sophisticated that children will be left behind.\\" =Accolades= In 2015, the second episode of the series, \\"Sphinx\\", was nominated at the Annecy International Animated Film Festival. In 2016, the series won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Casting for an Animated Series or Special.

It is not in communion with the Catholic Church, whose canon law considers it a schismatic sect. The ANCC was founded with the mission of fully implementing its interpretation of the Second Vatican Council and is notably more liberal than the Catholic Church in its acceptance of married clergy, homosexuality, same-sex marriage, the ordination of women, and use of contraception. History The American National Catholic Church traces its apostolic succession through Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos Duarte-Costa (1888–1961) of Brazil. Bishop Duarte-Costa was an early proponent of some of the reforms of the Second Vatican Council. As early as 1936, he called for the celebration of the liturgy in the vernacular; a greater role for the laity in the liturgy, including service as Eucharistic Ministers; and the election rather than appointment of bishops. He advocated for allowing clergy to marry and for general absolution at Mass and was a vocal critic during and after World War II of the Brazilian government's ties with Nazi Germany. In 1945 Duarte-Costa announced plans to form the Brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church, in which priests would be permitted to marry and hold secular jobs, private confession and praying the rosaries would be abolished, and bishops would be elected by popular vote. Consequently, he was excommunicated. Currently, there are American National Catholic Church parishes in Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Missouri, North Dakota, and Virginia, with others in the process of formation in Illinois, Florida, New Mexico, and New York. ANCC priests and deacons also minister in prisons, homeless shelters, HIV/AIDS residences, psychiatric hospitals, teaching, and media. The first presiding bishop of the ANCC is the Most Reverend George R. Lucey, who is a member of the Franciscan Community of Mercy (FCM). Polity and Beliefs The ANCC embraces the entire Roman Catholic deposit of faith but diverges from it regarding the ordination of women and in the realm of sexual morality. It does, however, hold belief in the Trinity, a form of apostolic succession, the salvific act of Christ, the Economy of Salvation, Mariology, and the sacraments. But consistent with the Catholic Church's fidelity to the renewing spirit of the Second Vatican Council, and regarding itself as a contemporary expression of an ancient faith, it departs in many ways from the Roman Catholic Church. While it respects the Bishop of Rome, considering him \\"first among equals\\", it does not acknowledge his primacy or infallibility. Since its founding in 2009, the ANCC has embraced a path of intentional growth in recognition that many other Independent Catholic jurisdictions failed because they concentrated on quantity at the expense of quality. The early stages of the Church's development focused, consequently, on establishing a strong foundation and solid infrastructure, both aimed at ensuring the Church's future. The American National Catholic Church states that it measures its growth in terms of four general aims: * to further the work of the Gospel of Jesus Christ by proclaiming the presence of the Kingdom; * to support missionary work; * to be involved in the planting and strengthening of local churches; and * to edify and strengthen believers through Christian fellowship, the liturgical celebrations of the seven sacraments, and the ministry of the Word of God. The ANCC is congregational rather than hierarchical. Parishes are self-governing, bishops are elected by clergy and laity for limited terms rather than appointed, and all clergy are non- stipendiary, supporting themselves and their ministries with regular jobs intended to keep them in touch with the worldly challenges faced by their parishioners. In both worship and governance, the ANCC actively encourages lay participation. The ANCC allows qualified women and gay persons to receive Holy Orders. Believing that the lived experience of married life can be an invaluable gift for ministry, the ANCC also welcomes married clergy. The ANCC is one of a few Christian churches that recognize gay marriage. Training of clergy All clergy receive comprehensive theological training. After providing certificates of Baptism and Confirmation (and in the case of persons previously ordained, Ordination), applicants must submit a detailed personal narrative, provide professional and personal references, and undergo exhaustive interviews with vocation/formation staff. Applicants must attend an ANCC retreat during which they are further evaluated. Applicants previously ordained in other Christian churches must complete a pastoral internship and a diaconate assignment of one year, after which an additional two-year discernment period is imposed before full incorporation into the ANCC. Only two percent of applicants are selected to study for the priesthood or for incardination. The Church's clergy possess numerous degrees from institutions of higher learning as well as degrees from accredited seminary programs from various universities. Candidates for ordination to the diaconate and priesthood receive a rigorous, comprehensive, academic and practical education. Criminal background checks and psychological evaluations are required of all applicants. In 2010 the Church founded its own seminary, St. John the Beloved Seminary, offering non-residential theological studies for those pursuing the priesthood. there were three ANCC seminarians there.
