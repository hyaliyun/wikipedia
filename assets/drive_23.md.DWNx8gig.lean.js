Almost all important > sites in this region are (or were) associated with waterholes and/or > waterfalls. > Much of the illness and accidents which Europeans suffered in this area were > attributed by Kuku Nyungkul to these actions.

Research Study No. 1. The Underlying Causes for the Deaths of Australian Aboriginal People in Government Detention. National Aboriginal and Islander Legal Services Secretariat. During the 1950s Lutheran Church of Australia properly established an Aboriginal mission on the Bloomfield River, into which the remnant Kuku Nyungkal population still living on their country were moved. The Lutheran Church described the situation as follows:Lutheran Church of Australia(Queensland) (1978) \\"Report of Visitation 11‚Äì29 June\\", quoted in Bana Yarraliji Bubu Incorporated (2008) Strategic Plan for Kuku Nyungkal Country.

The depth of their feelings > was variously expressed: \\"We are like a crane standing on one leg (no room > for two feet on the ground) on a little island\\" : \\"we are like animals in a > wild cage\\" Present By 1995, one century after the initial \\"invasion\\" by tin miners, an Aboriginal Land Tribunal inquired into the extent to which Kuku Nyungkal traditions, beliefs, and people had been impacted by the colonization of their country. At that time Kuku Nyungkal representatives submitted, and the Tribunal agreed: > Aboriginal culture in south eastern Cape York Peninsula has changed > considerably since the arrival of the first European land visitor in 1872 > ... Technological innovations and introductions have altered many aspects of > Kuku-Nyungkul life and their economic and political system has also been > affected by the social forces of a dominant way of life imposing itself on a > previously independent people. Living away from country in a centralised > community much of the time has also meant changes. The culture of the Kuku- > Nyungkul people is not the same as it was one hundred years ago. On 9 December 2007, the Kuku Nyungkal people were included within an overarching Federal Court native title determination in which their legal right to their own lands and waters was retrospectively acknowledged, and new exclusive rights to possess, occupy, use and enjoys some of their original lands along the Annan River was restoredNational Native title (2007) \\"Eastern Kuku Yalanji People's native title determination\\" Accessed 16 March 2009 See also * Kuku Nyungkal language NotesReferences * Anderson, Christopher (1983) \\"Aborigines and Tin Mining in North Queensland: A Case Study in the Anthropology of Contact History\\" Mankind. 13(6) pp 473‚Äì498 External links * AusAnthrop Australian Aboriginal tribal database entry for Nyungal * Gordon, Raymond G., Jr. (ed.), 2005. \\"Kuku Yalanji\\" entry in Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Fifteenth edition.

His music is usually described as EBM, Synthpop or Futurepop. History After releasing the track \\"The Protagonist\\" as a one-off compilation entry on the Advanced Electronics Vol. 3, Faderhead received a deal with Accession Records/Indigo to release his debut album FH1 in 2006. Positive reviews made FH1 an instant debut-success with standout tracks like \\"The Protagonist\\", \\"Vanish\\" and \\"O/H Scavenger\\". The year progressed and saw Faderhead play shows alongside bands like Diary Of Dreams, SITD, Painbastard and others. 2007 saw the release of the FH2 CD which featured the club hit \\"Dirtygrrrls/Dirtybois\\". Faderhead released a music video for the track \\"Girly Show\\" and played festivals like Wave-Gotik-Treffen (Germany) and Infest (UK) among other shows. 2008 started with the departure from Accession Records and the signing to L-Tracks Recordings. This decision led to serious speculation regarding the future of Faderhead by press and fans, but the free song/video release of the piano ballad \\"Exit Ghost\\" revealed that the project would continue. Only a few months later the club anthem \\"TZDV\\" was released, and on October 10, the FH3 album was released and again gathered top reviews. In 2009, Faderhead played the M'era Luna Festival (Germany), the Exit Festival (Serbia) as well as shows in the Netherlands, Italy, Greece, Great Britain, Belgium and Mexico. In October 2009, Faderhead released the \\"Horizon Born\\" EP, which was well received. 2010 saw the release of Trilogy. Since FH1, FH2 and FH3 had been sold out and were not reprinted, Faderhead decided to compile the most popular 18 tracks from that release onto one CD. In October 2010, the fourth full-length album, Black Friday, was released. The concept album tells the story of a night gone wrong. It was accompanied by a 15-minute short movie and quickly garnered reviews as Faderhead's most mature album. Faderhead played a European club tour as well as the Christmas Ball Festival tour with Laibach, Project Pitchfork, Fields Of The Nephilim and Agonoize. 2011 began with a 15-show tour in the US with Aesthetic Perfection and Everything Goes Cold and ended with a download-only EP release called ‚ÄúThe Way To Fuck Clubs‚Äù, which showcased remixes of ‚ÄúThe Way To Fuck God‚Äù as well as an acoustic version of ‚ÄúHot Bath And A Cold Razor‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Moth And The Fire‚Äù. The biggest show of 2011 happened at Wave-Gotik- Treffen in Leipzig when the festival organizers had to close the venue to prevent overcrowding. In 2012, the fifth album, The World Of Faderhead, was released alongside three 360¬∞ panoramic images and 3 music videos. The video to ‚ÄúFistful Of Fuck You‚Äù became popular, due to its original style and content. Faderhead headlined a 14-show US tour and played all over Europe including a set at the M'era Luna Festival hangar stage. The European pressing of ‚ÄúThe World Of Faderhead‚Äù was already almost sold out before the end of the year and Faderhead reached the no. 7 spot of MusicNonStop's best-selling releases of 2012 in the UK, tying And One and coming in ahead of legacy-acts like Fields Of The Nephilim, De/Vision, Suicide Commando and Hocico. Because \\"The World Of Faderhead\\" sold out so quickly, Faderhead also released the double-CD-compilation \\"Two Sides To Every Story\\" which features Faderhead's most popular clubtracks on CD 1 and the most popular pop-songs/ballads on CD 2. 2013 saw Faderhead releasing the \\"FH4\\" album, which spawned the single and video to \\"Dancers\\", a collaboration with Techno MC Shawn Mierez (\\"I Like It Loud\\") and Shaolyn (\\"Face Down\\"). Worldwide touring (including 14 shows in the US) followed and Faderhead returned to the Amphi Festival in K√∂ln/Germany. In 2014 the ‚ÄúAtoms & Emptiness‚Äù-album was released in February. Faderhead went on a 4-week European co-headlining tour with Aesthetic Perfection and music videos to ‚ÄúStand Up‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhen The Freaks Come Out‚Äù were released. After that Faderhead took a 1.5 year break from producing and performing. 2016 Faderhead released ‚ÄúFH-X‚Äù on February 12 and toured the UK and Germany. In October he also released the 10 song EP ‚ÄúAnima In Machina‚Äù which featured 8 reworked old songs and 2 new tracks. Then Faderhead supported Covenant on a 10-show-tour in Germany which sold-out venues in Hamburg, Hannover, Erfurt, Stuttgart, Krefeld and Frankfurt. The \\"Anima In Machina\\"-EP occupied the number 1 position in the German Alternative Charts (DAC) for 6 weeks in a row. 2017 opened with the release of the single ‚ÄúKnow Your Darkness‚Äù, a futurepop club song which debuted at number 1 in the German Alternative Charts (DAC). The ninth studio album \\"Night Physics\\" (including the single \\"Know Your Darkness\\") was releases in late 2017 and reached number 1 in the German Alternative Charts (DAC), followed by a 10-show-tour of Germany and a concert at the sold out Agra-Halle at Wave-Gotik-Treffen 2018. Faderhead then went on another tour of Germany with Project Pitchfork. In 2019 Faderhead played the main stage at Amphi Festival in Cologne/Germany as well as NCN Festival in Deutzen briefly before the release of the tenth studio album \\"Asteria\\", which included the single \\"From His Broken Bones\\" that reached number 2 on the German Alternative Charts (DAC)). The band played an album release show at Kulttempel in Oberhausen/Germany. In spring of 2020 Faderhead played only one show of the \\"Asteria\\"-Germany tour (on March 7, 2020 in Mannheim) before the tour was cancelled due to the worldwide Coronavirus/Covid19 pandemic. Faderhead's live shows are currently supported by either J√∂rg L√ºtkemeier (formerly Straftanz) or Joel Meyer (formerly Project SAM) on keyboards and backing vocals. He has also previously been supported live by Daniel Meyer. The Hamburg producer/vocalist uses different musicians for live performances and has collaborated on stage with musicians like Daniel Myer (Haujobb), Shawn \\"Ultimate MC\\" Mierez or with Marco Visconti (formerly XP8) - nicknamed ‚ÄúThe Lord‚Äù - as the longest standing member. Video game A video game based on the music video for Fistful of Fuck You was created and released in 2014. The Beats of Rage game engine was used to program and run the game. Its design was based on images created by the music video's artists and programmed by Trev Nethers of the New York-based industrial band, Social Autopsy. The game pays strict attention to the music video's content, allowing players to relive the music video first hand. It also includes playable characters, enemies and levels not featured in the music video. The game can be downloaded via Faderhead's official website. In 2018, the game was re-released as Faderhead 2.0. The new release addressed bugs, balance issues, and animation problems. All new content was also added including new modes, playable characters and the ability to play the game with two players. Survival Mode allows the player to play as Nethers from Social Autopsy in a challenge to regain health by defeating enemies and absorbing their lifeforce. Music Video Mode is a modified version of Story Mode that plays exactly like the Music Video with shorter levels, fewer enemies and a new move set for the Faderhead character. Revenge Mode gives access to the boss characters in a reversal of Story Mode where you must stop Faderhead from playing his concert. Playable bosses include Andy from Combichrist, Steve from And One, Chris from Blutengel, Graves from Aesthetic Perfection and Brian from The Gothsicles. Another new mode was also added, called Tournament Mode, which allows two to four players to compete against each other in a versus/fighting style of gameplay using all the playable characters from the game.

Name The village name means \\"line town\\" after the straight piece of road that runs through it. The village ends with corners in the road at each end. Landscape Although the road does not have corners, the road has an incline up to a hill. The top of the hill is located near the 3rd West-most farm. The farm land located west of the four farms and the road. They belong to each respective farm. This piece is mostly flat land with the exception of two consecutive hills located on the 3rd West-most town. There are two other pieces of farm land. One is located east of the road and between the farms and the hamlet. It is flat, save for a small stream that runs through it. The last piece of farmland lies east of the road opposite the first three of the West- most farms. It is distinctive for the tree islands of shrubbery, trees and wetland plants like bullrush. The land is mostly flat with the east most side both climbing and sinking to create a steep 30 degree slope. The outer edge of this field has a steady stream and on the other side of it a sharp forested hill with an incline of some 40-50 degrees. Structure This is a very small village. It is composed of 4 major family run farms and a hamlet. There are two bus stops in between the farms and the hamlet - one for each direction. The village neighbors with the Wƒôdkowy village approximately to the North-West and the Swaro≈ºyn town, some to the South-East. The nearest school is located in Swaro≈ºyn, as is the nearest library, (Catholic) church, post office, railway station and (most of) the convenience shops. The closest convenience shop is in Wƒôdkowy. Shopping There are three shops close two here: * Wƒôdkowy - Sklep spo≈ºywczo-przemys≈Çowy - Pati - This goes through periods of closure, limited business hours, and limited products, where it primarily caters for workers of the factories dominating the town. * Boroszewo - Livio - labelled: Sklep spo≈ºywczo-przemys≈Çowy * Swaro≈ºyn - Sklep spo≈ºywczo-przemys≈Çowy - Lewiatan Traffic Since the opening and later the expansion of manufacturing buildings in Wƒôdkowy, the road has become substantially more busy.

JPQL is used to make queries against entities stored in a relational database. It is heavily inspired by SQL, and its queries resemble SQL queries in syntax, but operate against JPA entity objects rather than directly with database tables. In addition to retrieving objects (\`SELECT\` queries), JPQL supports set based \`UPDATE\` and \`DELETE\` queries.

We could write a function returning a list of authors with the given last name as follows: import javax.persistence.EntityManager; import javax.persistence.TypedQuery; ... public List getAuthorsByLastName(String lastName) { String queryString = \\"SELECT a FROM Author a \\" + \\"WHERE a.lastName IS NULL OR LOWER(a.lastName) = LOWER(:lastName)\\"; TypedQuery query = getEntityManager().createQuery(queryString, Author.class); query.setParameter(\\"lastName\\", lastName); return query.getResultList(); } Hibernate Query Language JPQL is based on the Hibernate Query Language (HQL), an earlier non-standard query language included in the Hibernate object-relational mapping library.

He came to international prominence in 1975 while he was living in Uganda and was sentenced to death for espionage and sedition following comments about President Idi Amin in a book which Hills wrote. After Amin rebuffed appeals for clemency by the Queen, Hills was released and allowed to return to the UK following the intervention of the British government. Biography Hills was born in the Birmingham suburb of Moseley. He attended King Edward's School, Birmingham before going on to Oxford University in 1932 where he read Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Lincoln College. In 1935, he left Oxford to travel through Germany, funding himself by writing for the Birmingham Post. Returning to England, Hills worked briefly at Shell-Mex before moving to Poland in 1937 as English editor of a cultural magazine. Hills' book Return to Poland showed his fascination with pre-war Poland, and in 1939 he moved to Warsaw to teach English. At the outbreak of war, he moved to Romania where Hills worked with the British Council. He was for a time seconded to General Kopanski's Polish Carpathian Lancers Brigade, and then to the King's Own Royal Regiment. Polish-speaking, he joined the 5th Kresowa Division in Iraq and Palestine before being sent to Italy in 1944. In 1945, Hills served as an officer of the British Eighth Army in Italy. He fought with the Polish Carpathian Lancers Brigade and the King's Own Royal Regiment in the Second World War. After the Battle of Monte Cassino, he was involved with the implementation of the Yalta Repatriation agreements. He found that thousands of Ukrainians and Russians were being sent to gulags or condemned to death. This was known as Operation Keelhaul. Hills could not accept this as they had fought alongside the Allies against the Nazis and he did everything in his power to thwart the return of all but a bare minimum. Norman Davies in his book Europe: A History and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn in The Gulag Archipelago recognised Hills's part in this. These papers contain much valuable correspondence that Hills had with Nikolai Tolstoy, Professor Hugh Trevor-Roper, Lord Bethell and many others together with Public Record Office documents help to show what really happened. Hills took a similarly humane and independent line over the question of the SS Fede, a decrepit hulk which was anchored off La Spezia and crammed with 1,200 Polish Jews, survivors of the Holocaust who were determined to make their way to Palestine in the face of a British blockade and quota restrictions on Jewish immigration. The Jews were already on hunger strike, and their leaders were threatening to blow up the boat if the British refused to allow them to sail. Hills persuaded the authorities to look the other way as the Fede raised anchor, an episode immortalized by Leon Uris in his novel Exodus. When the war was over, Hills became an interpreter and liaison officer with the Soviet military mission at Taranto. After being demobbed, he taught English in Germany and restless by nature cycled from the Arctic Circle to Salonika. In 1955 he moved to Turkey teaching English in Ankara before becoming an instructor at the Technical University. In 1963 Hills moved to Uganda. He was teaching at Makerere University in Kampala when Idi Amin seized power in 1971. Hills spoke out regarding Amin in the book he was writing, The White Pumpkin and was arrested in April 1975 charged with espionage and sedition. Tried before a military tribunal chaired by Juma Butabika, he was condemned to death by firing squad for referring to the dictator as a 'black Nero' and a 'village tyrant'. The Queen interceded on Hills' behalf, and the then-Foreign Secretary, James Callaghan, flew out to Kampala to bring Hills home. In 1981 Hills played himself in the film Rise and Fall of Idi Amin. The incident was alluded to by Welsh comedian Max Boyce in his tribute song to the Rugby legends known as the Pontypool Front Row, \\"We've had trouble in Uganda, with President Amin/We had to send an envoy with a message from the Queen/To stay the execution, but Amin answered \\"No\\"/Until a card was sent from the Viet Gwent - the Pontypool Front Row\\" Hills returned to Africa in 1976, travelling through Southern Rhodesia, which was the subject of his book The Last Days of White Rhodesia. In 1982 he taught in Nairobi. In 1985 Hills returned to Poland but was summarily expelled as a result of a piece in The Daily Telegraphs Peterborough column, in which he was described as travelling through Poland in order to write a \\"less than complimentary book about the Communist regime\\". Hills had a daughter, Gillian Hills, by his first wife Dunia Le≈õmian, daughter of Polish symbolist poet Boles≈Çaw Le≈õmian, and two sons by his second wife Ingrid Jan.

J. R. Murray's name for a chess variant that was played in medieval Europe. It was somewhat like sittuyin but developed independently, probably to get the armies into contact sooner. It was current in England and Paris in the second half of the 12th century, and perhaps at other times and/or places. The pieces started with the pawns on the third ranks, and the queen on the same square as the e-file pawn. These two pieces could not be moved together, and after that no two pieces of the same color could be on the same square together. But, before either moved, both could be captured together. After that, the usual rules of medieval chess (i.e. shatranj or similar) applied. Murray records these two starting positions, and writes as if the players could choose the starting positions of their kings and bishops and knights and rooks. It is not known if the game had an initial setting-up stage like in sittuyin. The ordinary European chess of the time was sometimes called the long assize to distinguish.

As an organizational type The term, as coined by political scientist Patricia M. Thornton at the University of Oxford, describes \\"a unique hybrid form of politico-religious mobilization\\" adopted by a handful of syncretic qigong (Ê∞îÂäü) groups that emerged in the People's Republic of China (PRC) during the late 1980s and early 1990s, and were subjected to extreme repression following the crackdown against banned religious and spiritual organizations in 1999. Cybersectarianism as an organizational form involves: \\"highly dispersed small groups of practitioners that may remain largely anonymous within the larger social context and operate in relative secrecy, while still linked remotely to a larger network of believers who share a set of practices and texts, and often a common devotion to a particular leader. Overseas supporters provide funding and support; domestic practitioners distribute tracts, participate in acts of resistance, and share information on the internal situation with outsiders. Collectively, members and practitioners of such sects construct viable virtual communities of faith, exchanging personal testimonies and engaging in collective study via email, on-line chat rooms and web-based message boards.\\"Patricia M. Thornton, \\"The New Cybersects: Resistance and Repression in the Reform era.\\" In Elizabeth Perry and Mark Selden, eds., Chinese Society: Change, Conflict and Resistance (second edition) (London and New York: Routledge, 2003), pp. 149-50. In China Transnational Chinese cybersects include the group commonly known in the West as Falun Gong (Ê≥ïËΩÆÂäü), Zhong Gong (‰∏≠ÂçéÂÖªÁîüÁõäÊô∫Âäü), and the Taiwan-based group founded by Suma Ching Hai, commonly referred to in the PRC as Guanyin Famen (ËßÇÈü≥Ê≥ïÈó®), but rendered in English by the Ching Hai World Society as Quan Yin.Patricia M. Thornton, \\"Manufacturing Dissent in Transnational China: Boomerang, Backfire or Spectacle?\\" In Kevin J. O‚ÄôBrien, ed., Popular Contention in China (Harvard University Press, 2008). Some new transnational Protestant groups also subjected to persecution in the PRC, like Eastern Lightning, have likewise taken to the internet to ensure group survival, and taken on some of the characteristics of cybersects elsewhere.Emily C. Dunn, \\"Netizens of heaven: contesting orthodoxies on the Chinese Protestant web,\\" Asian Studies Review 31, 4 (2007), pp. 447‚Äì58 Like the New Cyberreligious Movements (NCRMs) described by Karaflogka,Karaflogka, Anastasia. \\"Religious Discourse and Cyberspace.\\" Religion 32 (2002), pp. 279-291. Karaflogka cites the cyber- diocese of Partenia and Falun Gong as two examples of cyberreligions. cybersect participants rely upon computer mediated communication (CMC) in their personal religious or spiritual practice, performing cyberpilgrimages, participating in cybermeditation sessions online, and/or cyberevangelism in third-party chatrooms. Some cybersect members of groups, including Aum Shinrikyo and al Qaeda, engage in \\"repertoires of electronic contention,\\" using websites and e-mail to mobilize participants for protest and contention, as well as hactivism (acts of electronic disruption) and even cyberterrorism (acts of physical harm caused by the disruption of power grids, traffic control, and other systems of resource delivery and public safety). Among Muslims More recently, Sunni- and Shia- affiliated hackers have attacked and counter-attacked hundreds of websites in a vast struggle over cyberspace that has been characterized as an outbreak of cybersectarianism.\\"Cyber- sectarianism,\\" The Layalina Review on Public Diplomacy and Arab Media, Vol. IV, No. 22 (10‚Äì23 October 2008), pp. 5-6, available at Alaeldin Maghaireh describes two principal types of cyber-sectarian conflict in Muslim cyberspace: \\"Cyber-Islamist Advocacy,\\" which consists of \\"religious publications, debates, emails awareness, lectures and videos;\\" and \\"Islamist Hactivism,\\" which involves \\"cyber attacks against other religious or non- religious websites.\\"Alaedin Maghaireh, \\"Shariah Law and Cyber-Sectarian Conflict: How can Islamic Criminal Law respond to cyber crime?,\\" p. 338, available at Similarly, Dru C. Gladney describes how Muslim netizens in the Chinese province of Xinjiang have turned to the internet to explore and express their desires for independence with the broader, transnational Uyghur communities, culminating in what Gladney describes as a groundswell of \\"cyber- separatism.\\"Dru C. Gladney, Dislocating China: Reflections on Muslims, Minorities and Other Subaltern Subjects (C. Hurst & Co. Publishers, 2004), see Chapter 11, \\"Cyber-separatism,\\" pp. 229-259. Other groups When taken to the airwaves and posted on the internet, divisive sectarian language among Catholic and Protestant residents of post-agreement Northern Ireland has also been described as an outbreak of cybersectarianism by Ballymena-born BBC reporter, Declan Lawn, and others.Des Blackadder, \\"Your Views: Panorama in Ballymena,\\" Ballymena Times, 8 April 2008.Dermod Moore, \\"Bootboy: Gougers, langers and victimology,\\" Dublin theatre reviews‚Ä¶ and other passions (10 March 2006).On the use of the term to describe the migration of political and religious sectarian divisions to cyberspace, see also Bernd Biege, \\"Bernd's Ireland Travel Blog: F√°ilte Second Ireland,\\" 5 November 2007 In a similar vein, the term is also commonly used to describe the internecine internet- based partisan splintering among various factions of the Socialist Party of America,See \\"What's In A Name. Rose By Any Other Name Still Belongs In A Fist,\\" New America: Welcome to the blog of the Social Democrats USA, standing in the legacy of the Socialist Party of America (17 June 2008).aka Bootboy, \\"I predict a riot\\", Hot Press Hot Press (14 March 2006). and among members of the Communist League. There is some evidence to suggest that the heavy reliance of such groups on the internet, a medium that not only facilitates but also encourages user interactivity and peer-to-peer information sharing, may present serious challenges to the maintenance of internal coherence and policing of orthodoxy by a central core of leaders. Cultural theorist Paul Virilio likewise described the San Diego-based UFO religious group Heaven's Gate as a cybersect, due to the group's heavy reliance on CMC as a mode of communication prior to the group's 1997 collective suicide;Paul Virilio,The Information Bomb (Verso, 2005), p. 41. while Rita M. Hauck of Fort Hays University considers \\"cybersect\\" to be a new but widely used term that \\"implies cyborgs or cybernauts with a collaborative agenda.Rita M.

She appeared in television shows in the 1990s, where she campaigned for legalization of and regulation of the profession.  Biography  Niehoff was born in Cologne. Her mother, Anna, fled from her father and raised her children by fortune telling and minor crimes. After her mother was arrested, Niehoff and her brother Amando lived in a Catholic orphanage until she was 14 when she began work as a trainee clerk. When she was 17, she met a brothel-owner whom she later married. Her husband committed suicide in 1972. During that year Niehoff started working as a prostitute in the red light district of Hamburg, St. Pauli and in the Herbertstra√üe. Later she opened a studio and became known as a dominatrix. She appeared on German TV talk shows campaigning for prostitutes and legalisation of the profession from the 1970s onwards. By the 1990s, she had retired from prostitution but stayed in Hamburg's red light district to open a bar. A bar that she owned from 1998 was closed in 2000 when she had unpaid tax bills. In 1991, she co-founded Ragazza e.V to help young prostitutes and in the same period began to help drug addicts. Niehoff died in February 2009 from lung disease and complications from diabetes in a Hamburg hospital. Niehoff was buried in the Garden of Women at the Ohlsdorf Cemetery. She was the first prostitute buried in this area for distinguished women, according to the coordinator of the funeral service. In November 2016, it emerged that a street was to be named after Niehoff in the Altona district of Hamburg.

Bancroft explained the design of the school in a 2008 interview: \\"I wanted pupils to feel they were part of a community... So I divided the place up into a form of glass screen so you would get views down from the level you were at into the other parts of the school. And also I wanted to make sure that you could from time to time glimpse the outside so that you would know where you were in the great surrounding community that Pimlico is, and the buildings surrounding it\\" His other school designs include the Elfrida Rathbone Girls' School in Camden and the Philippa Fawcett Teacher Training College in Streatham. Bancroft was a staunch defender of the GLC's unpopular Brutalist landmarks. Though he did not design it, he argued that the County Hall Island Block, vacant for 20 years, should have been listed as an early example of open plan office architectureDemolition work begins on eyesore (from BBC News) and expressed himself \\"quite horrified\\" by the demolition of Pimlico School.

According to Ho√†ng L√™ nh·∫•t th·ªëng ch√≠, during Emperor Le The Tong's reign, Chiem Thanh (Champa), Ai Lao (Laos) usually sent ambassadors to offer tributes to ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát (official name of Viet Nam under the L√™ Dynasty). The Emperor ordered to construct a building called Quan Su (Embassy) to receive foreign ambassadors to ThƒÉng Long. Because those ambassadors were all Buddhist, they decided to build a temple on the premises for worship. Today only the temple remains. According to Doctor Le Duy Trung's essay carved on the 1855 stele, the temple was close to Hau Quan Base in the early years of Gia Long Era (1802‚Äì1819). In 1822, the temple was renovated so that the local residents could practise worship here. When the troops withdrew, the temple was returned to the villagers.

It was the native file format of the old Autodesk 3D Studio DOS (releases 1 to 4), which was popular until its successor (3D Studio MAX 1.0) replaced it in April 1996. Having been around since 1990 (when the first version of 3D Studio DOS was launched), it has grown to become a de facto industry standard for transferring models between 3D programs, or for storing models for 3D resource catalogs (along with OBJ, which is more frequently used as a model archiving file format). While the 3DS format aims to provide an import/export format, retaining only essential geometry, texture and lighting data, the related MAX format (now superseded by the PRJ format) also contains extra information specific to Autodesk 3ds Max, to allow a scene to be completely saved/loaded.  Structure  3ds is a binary file format. The format is based in chunks, where each section of data is embedded in a block that contains a chunk identifier and the length of the data (to provide the location of the next main block), as well as the data itself. This allows parsers to skip chunks they don't recognize, and allows for extensions to the format. The chunks form a hierarchical structure, similar to an xml DOM tree. The first two bytes of the chunk are its ID. From that value the parser can identify the chunk and decide whether it will parse it or skip it. The next four bytes contain a little-endian integer that is the length of the chunk, including its data, the length of its sub-blocks and the 6-byte header. The next bytes are the chunk's data, followed by the sub- chunks, in a structure that may extend to several levels deep. Below is a list of the most common IDs for chunks, represented in a hierarchical fashion depicting their dependencies:Spacesimulator.net - 3ds format file reader, loader, by Damiano VitulliThe Labs: 3DS Specifics (now via Internet Archive) 0x4D4D // Main Chunk ‚îú‚îÄ 0x0002 // M3D Version ‚îú‚îÄ 0x3D3D // 3D Editor Chunk ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ 0x4000 // Object Block ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ 0x4100 // Triangular Mesh ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ 0x4110 // Vertices List ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ 0x4120 // Faces Description ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ 0x4130 // Faces Material ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ 0x4150 // Smoothing Group List ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ 0x4140 // Mapping Coordinates List ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ 0x4160 // Local Coordinates System ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ 0x4600 // Light ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ 0x4610 // Spotlight ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ 0x4700 // Camera ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ 0xAFFF // Material Block ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ 0xA000 // Material Name ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ 0xA010 // Ambient Color ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ 0xA020 // Diffuse Color ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ 0xA030 // Specular Color ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ 0xA200 // Texture Map 1 ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ 0xA230 // Bump Map ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ 0xA220 // Reflection Map ‚îÇ ‚îÇ /* Sub Chunks For Each Map */ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ 0xA300 // Mapping Filename ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ 0xA351 // Mapping Parameters ‚îî‚îÄ 0xB000 // Keyframer Chunk ‚îú‚îÄ 0xB002 // Mesh Information Block ‚îú‚îÄ 0xB007 // Spot Light Information Block ‚îî‚îÄ 0xB008 // Frames (Start and End) ‚îú‚îÄ 0xB010 // Object Name ‚îú‚îÄ 0xB013 // Object Pivot Point ‚îú‚îÄ 0xB020 // Position Track ‚îú‚îÄ 0xB021 // Rotation Track ‚îú‚îÄ 0xB022 // Scale Track ‚îî‚îÄ 0xB030 // Hierarchy Position  Shortcomings  It has been pointed out that, despite its popularity, the format may not be the most suitable for 3D data exchange. Some of the disadvantages mentioned are: * All meshes must be made of triangles. * All texture filenames are limited to the 8.3 DOS format. * The number of vertices and polygons per mesh is limited to 65536. * Accurate vertex normals cannot be stored in the .3ds file. Instead \\"smoothing groups\\" are used so that the receiving program can recreate a (hopefully good) representation of the vertex normals. This is still a hold-over legacy for many animation programs today which started in the 1980s (3DS MAX, Lightwave and trueSpace still use smoothing groups, and Maya did up to v2.51). * Object, light and camera names are limited to 10 characters. Material names are limited to 16 characters. * Directional light sources are not supported.  Notes  Smoothing groups (read about surfaces on Elements of Mesh Modeling for the rationale of their use) are stored as a bit field, with 4 bytes (a long int) for each face, thus allowing up to 32 (4√ó8) smoothing groups per face.

It manufactures products in cleaning, care and conservation products for bulk and private consumers. It was established in 1867 as a trading company. History  On 23 October 1867, Friedrich Christoph Werner and Georg Werner, descendants of Wolfgang Werner, a hunchback of the St. Quintin's Church, Mainz, founded the Werner Brothers waxware factory. In 1878 Georg Mertz, the second namesake, joined the company. Since then, the waxware factory has been trading under the name Werner & Mertz. In 1887, with the death of Georg Mertz, his brother-in-law, Philipp Adam Schneider, took over his shares and managed the company together with Friedrich Christoph Werner. After a fire in the factory in Mittlere Bleiche 16 in Mainzer Bleichenviertel, a new factory building was moved into in Mainzer Erthalstra√üe 5 on 30 September 1896. After Philipp Adam Schneider's death on 10 August 1901, his son Rudolf took over the management of the company at the age of 19. From 1903 he managed the company together with his brother Hermann Schneider. In 1908 a major fire destroyed the factory and residential buildings in Erthalstra√üe, and in autumn the company moved into its new factory buildings in Ingelheimer Aue. After a fire in 1917, production continued at the same location in the newly built factory in the summer of 1918. The ‚Ä≥Froschturm‚Ä≥, the landmark of the ‚Ä≥Erdal‚Ä≥ in Mainz, was also built at this new site. In 1944, a large-scale attack by allied bomber units destroyed 80 percent of the company buildings, but the frog tower remained intact. On 3 May 1946 Radio Frankfurt announced ‚Ä≥The world-famous Erdal factory is producing again‚Ä≥. The branch factory in Hallein, Austria, started production at the beginning of 1954. In the same year Rudolf Schneider left the company management. In 1962 Hermann Schneider handed over the management of the company to his son Helmut. The biggest investment in the company's history in 1996 was the construction of a modern logistics centre with a fully automatic high-bay warehouse in Mainz. The new \\"L8\\" production centre in Mainz was inaugurated in 2019. From Helmut Schneider's three children, his son Reinhard finally took over the management of the company in 2000 and in the fifth generation. In September 2010, the head office moved to an ‚Ä≥Energie- Plus-Bilanz-Haus‚Ä≥ on Rheinallee in Mainz. = The invention of shoe polish = At the end of the 19th century, based on its expertise in wax processing, the company developed a novel wax-based shoe polish: the shoe dyes and shine agents previously available, consisting of sulphur, carbon black, syrup, molasses and water, had a rather destructive effect on the leather, adhered less to the shoes and soiled the men's legwear and ladies' skirts. = The development of the shoe care brand Erdal = In order to be able to register the \\"Stiefelwichse\\" under trademark law, a suitable name was found - following the street name of the company headquarters - with Erdal. On September 28, 1901, the Erdal trademark was filed with the Berlin Patent Office with the serial number 50 848 on the sign roll. Following the spirit of the times, the brand name was assigned an animal from the fairytale world as an unmistakable symbol in 1903. The frog - an animal living in and around the water that looks at the world from the frog's perspective - seemed to be suitable for depicting the properties of the novel shoe care product. Until the First World War, the logo appeared in the form of a green frog on the packaging specially developed for the shoe care product, a handy tin can. = From a trading company to a branded goods company = Products of Werner & Mertz: brands Erdal, Frosch and ratz fatz Between 1912 and 1939 the company grew steadily through new shoe care products, expansion of distribution and logistics as well as advertising and sales promotion. In 1921 Erdal was the best-selling shoe care product in Germany. At that time, the company had an estimated 1,200 employees. In 1928, the Berlin company Urban & Lemm, which produced the successful shoe polish Urbin, was acquired. In 1939, the workforce grew to around 1,800 employees. After 1945, the company increased its sales with new products. From 1946 to 1949 Paul Harnischmacher was president of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce for Rheinhessen. Tana Chemie GmbH was founded in 1971 to supply large-scale consumers such as restaurants, hospitals, industrial plants and office buildings, Werner & Mertz Polska in 1999 and Werner & Mertz Slovakia and the Czech Republic in 2001. In 1986 the Frosch brand was introduced - with phosphate-free household cleaners: Neutral and vinegar cleaners. In the meantime, the ecologically positioned range comprises more than 50 products.

It is part of Libertador municipality. According to a 2007 estimate of the National Institute of Statistics of Venezuela, it had a population of 150,971 people in 2007. The name Ant√≠mano derives from a combination of the words Atamanona and Amatima, the names of two indigenous groups which lived in the area before the Spanish Conquest. Ant√≠mano was established in 1621 as an agricultural village, and remained rural until the first part of the twentieth century. Towards the end of the nineteenth century the Venezuelan President Antonio Guzm√°n Blanco built a country house in Ant√≠mano, calling it \\"La Peque√±a Versalles\\" (Little Versailles). From the mid-1940s Ant√≠mano began to develop as an industrial zone, with the first factories producing Polar beer and Pepsi. The steel company Sidetur was founded here in 1948. The house of Guzman Blanco fell into disuse for over 30 years (despite being declared a National Monument) and was eventually restored in 2004, the building being turned into a Sociocultural Complex, and its grounds converted into a sports facility with baseball, football and basketball fields.Radio Nacional de Venezuela, 30 July 2004, 11.18pm Inauguran centro sociocultural y deportivo Casa de Campo Guzm√°n Blanco Since it is a large neighborhood, it is possible to get there on a number of Caracas Metro stations on Line 2 (the green one) including Ant√≠mano, Carapita, and Mamera.

This is a lifetime allowance of ¬£1,000,000 of gain that will be taxed at a reduced rate of 10%. This was reduced from ¬£10,000,000 in the 2020 Budget on 11 March 2020. To be eligible, a shareholder must have a 5% or more shareholding, and have been involved for a year or more with a company as an employee or director. Capital distributions from a limited company can occur as a result of a member's voluntary liquidation, and resulting profits are subject to CGT. Return of share capital following a resolution at the AGM is not classed as capital gains.

In the March 2011 budget it was raised to ¬£10m.http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/budget2011/tiin6173.pdf In the March 2020 budget, the lifetime allowance was reduced to ¬£1m.https://www.ftadviser.com/your-industry/2020/03/11/budget-2020-chancellor- slashes-entrepreneurs-relief/ In the opinion of the Resolution Foundation entrepreneurs' relief is expensive, regressive and ineffective. Scrapping the tax relief they argue could generate ¬£2.7 billion that could be spent on the public sector. However, that figure supposes that the relief scheme has zero effect in encouraging entrepreneurship and that individuals who had worked hard to create wealth would not look to reduce their tax bills. The Resolution Foundation maintains this tax break is enough to give ¬£100 per year to every household in the country if it is abolished. Roughly 52,000 individuals benefited from the tax break in 2015-16, but the chief financial gain was for a few very people, with about 6,000 claiming over ¬£1m each. The overall cost of the tax relief over a decade was roughly ¬£22bn though its effectiveness has not been seriously evaluated. Most entrepreneurs who claim the tax break say they did not know about it when they started their company, the foundation maintains.Move tax relief for entrepreneurs to NHS, thinktank says The Guardian In the 2020 budget, Rishi Sunak announced reforms to the relief, capping the lifetime claimable relief at ¬£1 million.

Honduran children are typically trafficked from rural areas to urban and tourist centers such as San Pedro Sula, the North Caribbean coast, and the Bay Islands. Honduran women and children are trafficked to Guatemala, El Salvador, Mexico, and the United States for sexual exploitation. Most foreign victims of commercial sexual exploitation in Honduras are from neighboring countries; some are economic migrants en route to the United States who are victimized by traffickers. Internal child labor and forced child labor for violent criminal gangs are serious concerns.\\"Honduras\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2008. U.S. Department of State (June 4, 2008). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. The Government of Honduras does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. During the reporting period, Honduras made strong efforts to increase law enforcement efforts against trafficking offenders and to increase collaboration with non- governmental organization (NGOs), but government services for trafficking victims, particularly adults, remained inadequate. U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2\\" in 2017. Prosecution The Honduran government took significant steps to investigate and punish human trafficking crimes during the reporting year. Honduras prohibits trafficking for the purpose of commercial sexual exploitation through Article 149 of its penal code and an anti-trafficking statute enacted in February 2006, but does not prohibit trafficking for the purpose of labor exploitation. Honduran laws against sex trafficking prescribe penalties of up to 13 years‚Äô imprisonment, which are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with those prescribed for other grave crimes such as rape. Last year, the government significantly increased efforts to investigate trafficking crimes by opening 74 investigations, initiating 13 prosecutions, and obtaining eight convictions, with sentences ranging from 5 to 27 years‚Äô imprisonment. This compares with 24 trafficking-related investigations, 17 prosecutions, eight convictions, and four significant prison terms obtained in 2006. The government also dedicated more prosecutors and police personnel to combat human trafficking activity. Of particular note was a joint effort by the police, NGO Casa Alianza, and the Tegucigalpa mayor‚Äôs office to utilize proactive strategies such as raids and stakeouts to catch human traffickers and remove victims from trafficking situations. However, anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts outside the capital and San Pedro Sula were few. The government expanded anti-trafficking training for law enforcement officials in 2007, training thousands of personnel with the assistance of IOM. Law enforcement authorities regularly work with neighboring countries and the United States on anti-trafficking efforts, as well as investigations of child sex tourism. However, defendants over the age of 60 are subject to house arrest in Honduras while awaiting trial; many of these accused offenders, including American citizens, flee or bribe their way out of the country and avoid prosecution. Some acts of complicity with human trafficking have been reported among lower-level immigration officials and in other sectors. However, no investigations or prosecutions of such corrupt activity have been opened by the government. Protection The Honduran government made limited progress in its efforts to assist trafficking victims during the reporting year. The government operated no dedicated shelters or services for trafficking victims, although it referred child trafficking victims to NGOs, which could only serve a small percentage of those in need. Honduran NGOs shouldered a heavy burden to provide victim care, and received no direct funding from the government. While the government increased training on referring trafficking victims for care, NGOs report that referrals in practice are unorganized and uneven. Moreover, few resources, public or private, are available for adult trafficking victims. During the reporting period, the government worked closely with IOM to repatriate more than a dozen young Hondurans who had been trafficked to neighboring countries for sexual exploitation, and Honduran consular officials are trained to identify trafficking victims. Victims are encouraged to assist in the investigation and prosecution of their traffickers, and the government collaborated with NGOs to identify victim witnesses. There were no reports of victims being penalized for unlawful acts committed as a result of their being trafficked. Honduras does not provide legal alternatives to the removal of foreign victims to countries where they may face hardship or retribution. There is no formal system for proactively identifying trafficking victims among vulnerable populations such as sex workers or criminal detainees. In collaboration with an NGO, law enforcement officials in Tegucigalpa undertook a number of victim rescue efforts; fifteen minors were rescued in Tegucigalpa in seven separate cases in 2007. Prevention The government made solid progress in prevention activities during the reporting period. The government‚Äôs inter-institutional committee against human trafficking hosted more than 50 training sessions for government officials, civil society members, students, and journalists, reaching more than 3,000 people. The government worked closely with NGOs and international organizations on additional TV and radio awareness-raising campaigns. In February 2008, the National Chamber of Tourism of Honduras and UNICEF launched a Code of Conduct campaign to encourage its tourism industry to prevent child sex tourism. No other government efforts to reduce demand for commercial sex acts were reported, although public awareness of the dangers of human trafficking appeared to be growing.

Hong Kong is primarily a transit point for illegal migrants, some of whom are subject to conditions of debt bondage, sexual exploitation, and forced labor. To a lesser extent, Hong Kong is a destination for women from the Chinese mainland and Southeast Asia who travel to Hong Kong voluntarily for legal employment in restaurants, bars, and hotels, but upon arrival are coerced into prostitution under conditions of debt bondage. Domestic and transnational criminal organizations carry out sex trafficking in China, including Hong Kong. Many mainland Chinese prostitutes in Hong Kong are reportedly sexually trafficked victims. Although Hong Kong continues efforts to regulate the thousands of foreign domestic workers from the Philippines and Indonesia currently working in Hong Kong, there appears to be a growing number of Indonesian workers who are subject to exploitation and conditions of involuntary servitude. Many Indonesian domestic workers earning the minimum wage are required to repay to their Indonesian recruitment agency $2,700 within their first seven months of employment, amounting to roughly 90 percent of a worker‚Äôs monthly salary. Such high levels of indebtedness assumed as part of the terms of employment can lead to situations of debt bondage, when unlawfully exploited by recruiters or employers. Additionally, the confiscation of passports by some Hong Kong employment agencies restricts the ability of migrant workers to leave their employer in cases of abuse, and places them under further control of their employment agency, leaving them vulnerable to trafficking.\\"Hong Kong\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2008. U.S. Department of State (June 4, 2008). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the region in \\"Tier 2 Watchlist\\" in 2020. Sex trafficking Sex trafficking in Hong Kong is an issue. Hongkonger and foreign women and girls are forced into prostitution in brothels, homes, and businesses in the city. Prosecution Hong Kong does not have specific anti-trafficking laws, but uses its Immigration Ordinance, the Crimes Ordinance, and other relevant laws to prohibit trafficking offenses. Labor trafficking is criminalized through the Employment Ordinance. Penalties for commercial sexual exploitation are commensurate with those for rape however penalties for trafficking are not stringent. During the year, the government reported two trafficking convictions, and two other reports of trafficking for the purposes of prostitution with insufficient evidence to warrant prosecution. The convictions involved six Filipina victims who were told that they would work as Hong Kong club entertainers. Upon arrival in Hong Kong, they were forced into prostitution. The victims sought assistance from the Philippine Consulate, and the Hong Kong Police worked closely with the Philippine Government to investigate, prosecute, and convict two Filipina traffickers, who were sentenced to three years‚Äô imprisonment. Hong Kong law stipulates that the commission a domestic worker recruitment agency deducts from a domestic worker‚Äôs pay cannot exceed 10 percent of the first month‚Äôs wages and prohibits agencies from charging additional fees or rewards however this is subject to abuse. Protection The government encourages victim participation in the investigation of traffickers, although in practice many are reluctant to do so. Women who agree to act as witnesses for the prosecution are granted immunity and allowed to return to their home country without being charged for illegal entry or breach of condition of stay. The Hong Kong Police has special units to provide protection for victims and witnesses. Given the low number of documented trafficking victims, Hong Kong authorities refer adult victims to existing social service programs at six government subsidized NGO shelters. Under the Protection of Children and Juveniles Ordinance, child victims of trafficking may be admitted to three refuge centers, one of which is operated by an NGO, with the other two operated by the Social Welfare Department. While at the shelters, victims are provided with government-sponsored assistance that includes financial and legal assistance and counseling and psychological support. Prevention To prevent trafficking among foreign domestic workers, the Labor Department continued to publish ‚Äúguidebooks‚Äù in several languages that explain workers‚Äô rights, the role of employment agencies, and services provided by the government. These guidebooks are handed out when workers apply for identity documents, and are distributed at strategic locations around the city, including the airport, district offices, consulates, offices of labor and migrant groups, post offices, and banks. Short ‚Äúpublicity messages‚Äù promoting the employment rights and benefits of foreign domestic workers are advertised in local newspapers (in various languages) and on television. The Immigration Department also delivered a talk for over 100 employment agencies of foreign domestic workers to discuss relevant provisions of the Immigration Ordinance and related offenses, as well as cautionary notes for arranging foreign domestic helper employment in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong government did not take any specific measures to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts during the reporting period.

People are frequently illegally trafficked through India for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation and forced/bonded labour. Although no reliable study of forced and bonded labour has been completed, NGOs estimate this problem affects 20 to 65 million Indians. Men, women and children are trafficked in India for diverse reasons. Women and girls are trafficked within the country for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation and forced marriage, especially in those areas where the sex ratio is highly skewed in favour of men. Men and boys are trafficked for the purposes of labour, and may be sexually exploited by traffickers to serve as gigolos, massage experts, escorts, etc. A significant portion of children are subjected to forced labour as factory workers, domestic servants, beggars, and agriculture workers, and have been used as armed combatants by some terrorist and insurgent groups. India is also a destination for women and girls from Nepal and Bangladesh trafficked for the purpose of commercial sexual exploitation. Nepali children are also trafficked to India for forced labour in circus shows. Indian women are trafficked to the Middle East for commercial sexual exploitation. Indian migrants who migrate willingly every year to the Middle East and Europe for work as domestic servants and low-skilled labourers may also end up part of the human trafficking industry. In such cases, workers may have been 'recruited' by way of fraudulent recruitment practices that lead them directly into situations of forced labour, including debt bondage; in other cases, high debts incurred to pay recruitment fees leave them vulnerable to exploitation by unscrupulous employers in the destination countries, where some are subjected to conditions of involuntary servitude, including non- payment of wages, restrictions on movement, unlawful withholding of passports, and physical or sexual abuse.\\"India\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2008. U.S. Department of State (4 June 2008). Human trafficking in India results in women suffering from both mental and physical issues. Mental issues include disorders such as PTSD, depression and anxiety. The lack of control women have in trafficking increases their risk of suffering from mental disorders. Women who are forced into trafficking are at a higher risk for HIV, TB, and other STDs. Condoms are rarely used and therefore there is a higher risk for victims to suffer from an STD. U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2\\" in 2017. Profile and demographics of traffickers As adults they use personal relationships and trust in their villages of origin to recruit additional girls. Prosecution The Government of India penalises trafficking for commercial sexual exploitation through the Immoral Trafficking Prevention Act (ITPA), with prescribed penalty of seven years' to life imprisonment. India also prohibits bonded and forced labour through the Bonded Labour Abolition Act, the Child Labour Act, and the Juvenile Justice Act. Indian authorities also use Sections 366(A) and 372 of the Indian Penal Code, prohibiting kidnapping and selling minors into prostitution respectively, to arrest traffickers. Penalties under these provisions are a maximum of ten years' imprisonment and a fine. Bonded labour and the movement of sex trafficking victims may occasionally be facilitated by corrupt officials.They protect brothels that exploit victims and protect traffickers and brothel keepers from arrest and other threats of enforcement. Usually, there are no efforts made to tackle the problem of government officials' complicity in trafficking workers for overseas employment. The bulk of bonded labour heads for Middle East to emerging economies and there are several media reports which report on the illegal and inhumane trafficking of Indian workers. India's Central Bureau of Investigation incorporated anti-trafficking training, by Dr. Gilly McKenzie of the Interpol Trafficking and Organised Crime Division, into its standard curriculum. In November, the State of Maharashtra developed an action plan to combat trafficking; it did not, however, allocate appropriate funding to accomplish the objectives of this plan. The government does not break down these statistics by sections of the law, meaning that law enforcement data regarding trafficking offenses may be conflated with data regarding arrests of women in prostitution pursuant to Section 8 of the ITPA. Protection India's efforts to protect victims of trafficking vary from state to state, but remain inadequate in many places. Victims of bonded labour are entitled to 10,000 (US $185) from the central government for rehabilitation, but this programme is unevenly executed across the country. Government authorities do not proactively identify and rescue bonded labourers, so few victims receive this assistance. Although children trafficked for forced labour may be housed in government shelters and are entitled to 20,000 ($370), the quality of many of these homes remains poor and the disbursement of rehabilitation funds is sporadic. Some states provide services to victims of bonded labour, but non- governmental organisations provide the majority of protection services to these victims. The central government does not provide protection services to Indian victims trafficked abroad for forced labour or commercial sexual exploitation. Indian diplomatic missions in destination countries may offer temporary shelter to nationals who have been trafficked; once repatriated, however, neither the central government nor most state governments offer any medical, psychological, legal, or reintegration assistance for these victims. Section 8 of the ITPA permits the arrest of women in prostitution. Although statistics on arrests under Section 8 are not kept, the government and some NGOs report that, through sensitisation and training, police officers no longer use this provision of the law; it is unclear whether arrests of women in prostitution under Section 8 have actually decreased. Because most law enforcement authorities lack formal procedures to identify trafficking victims among women arrested for prostitution; some victims may be arrested and punished for acts committed as a result of being trafficked. Some foreign victims trafficked to India are not subject to removal. Those who are subject to removal are not offered legal alternatives to removal to countries in which they may face hardship or retribution. NGOs report that some Bengali victims of commercial sexual exploitation are pushed back across the border without protection services. The government also does not repatriate Nepali victims; NGOs primarily perform this function. Many victims decline to testify against their traffickers due to the length of proceedings and fear of retribution by traffickers. The Ministry of Labour and Employment displays full-page advertisements against child labour in national newspapers at periodic intervals. The government has also instituted pre-departure information sessions for domestic workers migrating abroad on the risks of exploitation. These measures include distinguishing between 'Emigration Check Required' (ECR) and 'Emigration Check Not Required' (ECNR) passports. ECR passport holders must prove to government authorities that they shall not be exploited when travelling abroad, if they wish to travel. Many Indian workers pay large sums of money to agents who facilitate their emigration outside the official channels and willingly emigrate despite the risks, drawn by the hope of higher salaries abroad. Therefore, a dream of better future often lures the people abroad and hence trafficking cannot entirely be prevented. India ratified the 2000 UN TIP Protocol 2011. The Government of India launched an anti human trafficking web portal in February 2014 that they hope will be an effective way for interested parties to share information about this topic. The Salvation Army has a program that provides safe places for children of women who work in the red district in India.

The greatest threat of trafficking facing Indonesian men and women is that posed by conditions of forced labor and debt bondage in more developed Asian countries and the Middle East. Overview The government stopped permitting Indonesian women to travel to Japan and South Korea as ‚Äúcultural performers,‚Äù to curtail a practice that led to victims being trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation. However, in 2007 traffickers increasingly used false documents, including passports, to obtain tourist visas for women and girls who are subsequently forced into prostitution in Japan, through the unlawful exploitation of recruitment debts as high as $20,000 each. Trafficking of young girls to Taiwan as brides, mainly from West Kalimantan, persisted. Traffickers use false marriage licenses and other false documentation in order to obtain visas and subsequently force the women and girls into prostitution. Women from the People‚Äôs Republic of China, Thailand, and Eastern Europe are trafficked to Indonesia for commercial sexual exploitation, although the numbers are small compared with the number of Indonesians trafficked for this purpose. A significant number of Indonesian men and women who migrate overseas each year to work in the construction, agriculture, manufacturing, and domestic service sectors are subjected to conditions of forced labor or debt bondage in Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong, United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Kuwait, Qatar, Syria, France, Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands. Malaysia and Saudi Arabia are the top destinations for legal and illegal Indonesian migrant workers who are trafficked for domestic servitude, commercial sexual exploitation, and forced labor. Some labor recruitment companies, known as PJTKIs, operated similarly to trafficking rings, luring both male and female workers into debt bondage, involuntary servitude, and other trafficking situations. Some workers, often women intending to migrate, entered trafficking and trafficking-like situations during their attempt to find work abroad through licensed and unlicensed PJTKIs. These labor recruiters charged workers high commission fees‚Äîup to $3,000‚Äîwhich are not regulated under Indonesian law and often require workers to incur debt to pay, leaving them vulnerable in some instances to situations of debt bondage. PJTKIs also reportedly withheld the documents of some workers, and confined them in holding centers, sometimes for periods of many months. Some PJTKIs also used threats of violence to maintain control over prospective migrant workers. Recruitment agencies routinely falsified birth dates, including for children, in order to apply for passports and migrant worker documents. Internal trafficking is a significant problem in Indonesia with women and children exploited in domestic servitude, commercial sexual exploitation, rural agriculture, mining, fishing, and cottage industries. Women and girls are trafficked into commercial sexual exploitation in Malaysia, Singapore, and throughout Indonesia. Indonesians are recruited with offers of jobs in restaurants, factories, or as domestics and then forced into the sex trade. Young women and girls are trafficked throughout Indonesia and via the Riau Islands, Kalimantan, and Sulawesi to Malaysia and Singapore. Malaysians and Singaporeans constitute the largest number of sex tourists, and the Riau Islands and surrounding areas operate a ‚Äúprostitution economy,‚Äù according to local officials. Sex tourism is rampant in most urban areas and tourist destinations. A 2006 bilateral MOU between the Indonesian and Malaysian governments, governing the employment of an estimated one million Indonesian domestic workers in Malaysia, failed to provide adequate protection to Indonesian migrant workers and explicitly endorsed a practice that is widely seen as a potential facilitator of forced labor‚Äîthe right of Malaysian employers to hold the passports of Indonesian workers. This agreement has not been amended to offer protections from forced labor conditions.Trafficking in Persons Report 2008. U.S. Department of State (June 4, 2008). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. The Government of Indonesia does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of human trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. While the government made clear progress in bringing sex trafficking offenders to justice, in part through use of its new anti- trafficking law, a pronounced weakness shown was the failure to curb the large-scale trafficking practices of licensed and unlicensed Indonesian labor agencies. Indonesia has the region‚Äôs largest trafficking problem, with hundreds of thousands of trafficking victims, and has a largely unchecked problem of trafficking-related complicity by public officials. U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2\\" in 2017. Sex trafficking Sex trafficking in Indonesia is a common problem. Indonesian and foreign women and girls have been forced into prostitution in brothels and homes and been physically and psychologically abused. Prosecution The Indonesian government demonstrated increased efforts to combat trafficking in persons for commercial sexual exploitation in 2007 and implement its April 2007 comprehensive anti- trafficking law. Through that new law, Indonesia prohibits all forms of trafficking in persons, prescribing penalties of three to 15 years‚Äô imprisonment. These penalties are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with those prescribed for other grave crimes, such as rape. Police and prosecutors began using the new anti-trafficking law during the reporting period; however, other laws were still used in cases pending widespread implementation of the new law. For the second year in a row, law enforcement efforts against traffickers increased in 2007 over 2006: arrests increased 77 percent from 142 to 252, prosecutions increased 94 percent from 56 to 109, and convictions increased 27 percent from 36 to 46. These law enforcement actions were mainly against traffickers for commercial sexual exploitation. The average sentence given to convicted trafficking offenders was 45 months. Police in late 2007 cooperated with the Manpower Ministry to shut down a manpower company that was trafficking workers, rescuing over a hundred persons, including children, and arresting staff on charges of document falsification. The 21-man national police anti-trafficking task force worked with local police, the Ministry of Manpower, the Migrant Workers Protection Agency, Immigration, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and NGOs to shut down several large trafficking syndicates. The ongoing two-part ‚ÄúOperation Flower,‚Äù which began in March 2007, targeted trafficked children, primarily in commercial sexual exploitation. This operation shut down large operations in red-light districts of Jakarta, the Riau Islands, Central and West Java, and elsewhere, arresting dozens of pimps and rescuing dozens of children. Separately, local police in North Sumatra, South Sulawesi, Bali, Lombok, and West Kalimantan broke up trafficking syndicates. Some individual members of the security forces reportedly engaged in or facilitated trafficking, particularly by providing protection to brothels and prostitution fronts in discos, karaoke bars, and hotels, or by receiving bribes to turn a blind eye. In Sorong, Papua, local police reportedly honored the debt bondage of underage girls prostituted in local brothels as legitimate work contracts, and they pledged to enforce these terms. Although police in other areas of the country were often aware of children in commercial sexual exploitation or other trafficking situations, they frequently did not intervene to protect victims or arrest probable traffickers without specific complaints submitted by third parties. In 2007, several senior law enforcement officials complicit in trafficking were investigated for corruption, reprimanded, or transferred to less sensitive positions. There were no reports of Indonesian security forces prosecuting or disciplining their own members for involvement in prostitution or other activities related to trafficking. National Police reported arresting and prosecuting at least three immigration officials at key transit points. In May 2007, a former consul general in Johor Bahru, Malaysia, was found guilty of graft for overcharging for passport fees and sentenced to two years in prison. In January 2008, a former Indonesian ambassador to Malaysia was sentenced to 30 months in jail for corruption in the collection of migration document fees. The Corruption Eradication Commission‚Äôs prosecution team indicted a former senior Manpower Ministry official and a current Manpower official on corruption in relation to an audit of funds for foreign workers in Indonesia; both face 20-year jail terms. Protection Indonesia demonstrated measured improvement at national and local levels to protect victims of trafficking in Indonesia and abroad; however, available victim services remain overwhelmed by the large number of victims. Indonesia‚Äôs policy is not to detain or imprison trafficking victims. Police implementation of this policy varies in practice. Local police often arrested women and children in prostitution, including trafficking victims, who operated outside recognized prostitution zones on charges of violating public order. The Government encourages victims to assist in the investigation and prosecution of trafficking cases. Authorities continued to round up and deport a small number of foreign women in prostitution without determining whether they were victims of trafficking. The Foreign Ministry operated shelters for trafficking victims and migrant workers at its embassies and consulates abroad. In 2007, these diplomatic establishments sheltered thousands of Indonesian citizens, including trafficking victims. The Social Affairs Ministry Directorate of Social Assistance for Victims of Violence and Migrant Workers assisted victims returning from overseas by providing medical care, return and rehabilitation services. The Government provides some assistance, including limited medical aid, shelter, and financial help to its repatriated nationals who were trafficking victims. The Indonesian government provided some funding to domestic NGOs and civil society groups that supported services for trafficking victims. Work on finishing national guidelines for services to trafficked persons, through another revision of the Standard Operating Procedures for Return, Recovery and Reintegration of Trafficking Victims and a new regulation on standard minimum services met with little progress following passage of the anti-trafficking law. Prevention The Indonesian government continued efforts to promote awareness and prevent trafficking in persons. The government continued collaboration with numerous NGO and international organization efforts to raise awareness and prevent trafficking in persons. In 2007, the East Java provincial government collaborated with NGOs to formulate guidance on how to deal with trafficking cases. The Nusa Tenggara Barat province‚Äôs Legal Aid Association provided legal assistance to five villages in East Lombok to help formulate village regulations regarding the recruitment of migrant workers. The North Sulawesi Department of Religious Affairs established a counseling center in 2007 to provide religious counseling to victims of trafficking and those at risk. Media coverage of trafficking, both domestic and international, expanded with national television, radio and print media, and local newspapers routinely covering trafficking cases. The Government of Indonesia had not yet formed a national task force on trafficking, although this is mandated. The Government also failed to develop a second National Plan of Action to combat trafficking in persons, despite the fact that Indonesia‚Äôs first National Plan of Action expired at the end of December 2007. Apart from occasional raids on brothels or fronts for prostitution, there were no reported activities to reduce demand for commercial sex acts. There were no public awareness campaigns on reducing demand for commercial sex acts or sex tourism. However, Indonesia cooperated with Australia in the investigations of Australian nationals victimizing children for child sex tourism in Bali. Indonesian police similarly cooperated actively with U.S. law enforcement to arrest and expel American pedophiles sexually abusing children. Indonesian security forces participating in peacekeeping initiatives abroad received training on sexual exploitation and trafficking in persons prior to deployment. Indonesia has not ratified the 2000 UN TIP Protocol.

However, after the 1979 anti-monarchy revolution, this was banned. But, women's self-sale was prevalent due to economic crises and the spread of unemployment. The State Department‚Äôs statement According to a yearly report by the U.S. State Department on June 27, 2017, \\"Iranian girls aged 13 to 17 are targets of human trafficking gangs that are forcibly transmitted for sale and sexual services outside of Iran.\\".\\"Trafficking in Persons Report 2017: Tier Placements\\". www.state.gov.

The Iranian authorities‚Äô acknowledgments According to a report from the National Security Police of the Tehran Grand Command, as well as reports from the Center of Women's Affairs and the Committee of the Organization for the Defense of Victims of Violence in 2003, the smuggling of border women and girls to the Gulf States, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and even to European countries has expanded. Smugglers transmitted their victims from Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and Pakistan to Iran and then sent them to Europe. In 2003, the number of gangs detected and defused in the West Azerbaijan Province reached to 200. News shows that Iran is a source of trafficking in human beings, but the officials of the Iranian government refrain from providing accurate statistics for political and security reasons. In this regard, Ali Sadeghi, the head of the Immigration Police and the Iranian government's police law enforcement passport, admitted in February 2013 that Iranian girls were being trafficked to the Arab countries of the southern margin of the Persian Gulf. At the same time, Ismail Ahmadi Moghaddam, commander of the country's police forces, said that the main destination is human trafficking from Iran, European countries, Australia and Canada.

The government reportedly prohibits all forms of trafficking in persons through its 2004 Law on Combating Human Trafficking, which prescribes severe penalties, often including death sentences for convicted traffickers. However, border officials may be complicit in trafficking offenses and Iran has not reported any disciplinary action taken against officials suspected of facilitating trafficking. Furthermore, victims are arrested and may be punished for violations of morality standards such as adultery, defined as sexual relations outside marriage. According to the United States, the Government of Iran does not comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so. Lack of access to Iran by U.S. Government officials prohibits the collection of full data on the country‚Äôs human trafficking problem and the government‚Äôs efforts to curb it. Iran has not provided evidence of law enforcement activities against trafficking to the US government.\\"Iran\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2008.

The country has made serious efforts to reduce the problem in recent years and now ranks 90th out of 167 countries who provide data. Identification of victims, criminal justice work and efforts to co-ordinate with business and government agencies has been concerted in reducing this problem in the last decade. Low-skilled workers from China, Romania, Africa, Turkey, Thailand, the Philippines, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and India migrate voluntarily for contract jobs in the construction, agriculture, and health care industries. Some, however, may subsequently face conditions of forced labour, such as unlawful holding of passports, restrictions on movement, non-payment of wages, threats, and physical intimidation. It is not known if labour recruitment agencies in source countries and in Israel require workers to pay recruitment fees- a practice that makes workers highly vulnerable to trafficking. Israel had been a destination country for women trafficked from Russia, Ukraine, Moldova, Uzbekistan, Belarus, China, South Korea and perhaps the Philippines for the purpose of sexual exploitation. In 2008, NGO had noted an increase in the internal trafficking of Israeli women for commercial sexual exploitation, and reported new instances of trafficking of Israeli women abroad to Canada, Ireland, and England. African asylum seekers entering Israel illegally were also vulnerable to trafficking for forced labour or prostitution.\\"Israel\\". \\"Trafficking in Persons Report 2008\\".

Large numbers of Eritreans had been trafficked into Israel.Refugees and the Rashaida: human smuggling and trafficking from Eritrea to Sudan and Egypt New Issues in Refugee Research, Research Paper No. 254 In 2007, the government increased the number of convictions for sex trafficking offences, and conducted a campaign to prevent forced labour. Israel also continues to provide victims of sex trafficking with shelter, legal aid and protection assistance. NGOs claimed, \\"the shelters are insufficient to treat the scale of trafficking victims who were not officially identified in Israel, particularly among migrants and asylum seekers arriving from the Sinai.\\"\\"Trafficking in Persons Report 2012\\". U.S. Department of State (June 2012) p.195.

U.S. Department of State (June 2012) p.194. The construction of the 245 mile Israel‚ÄìEgypt barrier in 2013, is credited with further reducing human trafficking into Israel, by preventing irregular migration along the Sinai- Negev trafficking route.

Status of ratification of the SEM and SSA countries\\", United Nations Treaty Collection. Prosecution The Government of Israel has made progress in prosecuting and punishing trafficking offences. Israel prohibits all forms of trafficking in persons through its Anti- Trafficking Law that came into force 29 October 2006, which prescribes penalties of up to 16 years' imprisonment for sex trafficking of an adult, up to 20 years' imprisonment for sex trafficking of a minor, up to 16 years' imprisonment for slavery, and up to 7 years' imprisonment for forced labour. These penalties are commensurate with those for other grave crimes, such as rape. In 2007, the government convicted 38 individuals for sex trafficking‚Äîfour more than in 2006‚Äîwith sentences ranging from six months to 15 years' imprisonment and fines. In addition, 16 prosecutions for sex trafficking were in process as of 2008, and another 15 cases were pending appeal. Israel made some efforts to investigate and punish acts of involuntary servitude; in 2007, the government prepared three indictments for forced labor and one indictment for slavery. In addition, three criminal cases of fraud/deceit of foreign workers involving five defendants were pending prosecution or appeal as of 2008. Israel reported no prosecutions, convictions, or punishments of government officials complicit in trafficking in 2007. In February 2013 the newspaper Haaretz successfully sued the Tel Aviv District Court to reveal the name of a major sex trafficker who became a police informer, David Digmi. Protection The Government of Israel has improved its protection of trafficking victims, but evidence regarding the protection of victims of forced labor remains limited. The government operates a shelter largely for victims of sex trafficking with the support of a local NGO. Notably, though Israel lacks a specific shelter for victims of labor trafficking, government authorities sometimes refer victims of forced labor to the shelter for sex trafficking. Victims in this shelter receive medical treatment, psychiatric and social services, stipends, and temporary residency and work permits. The government mandates legal aid to all trafficking victims and employs formal procedures to identify victims of sex trafficking and refer them to a shelter. Foreign workers who file complaints regarding criminal offenses are not arrested, are generally placed in alternative employment, and are granted immigration relief. Victims of trafficking receive legal alternatives to their removal to countries in which they may face hardship or retribution, including the issuance of temporary visa extensions. The government encourages victims of sex trafficking to assist in investigations against their traffickers, but it does not actively encourage victims of forced labor to do the same. Victims not housed in the government shelter, including victims of internal trafficking, do not receive the same level of protection services from the government as victims located in shelters. Prevention The 245 mile long Israel‚ÄìEgypt barrier, completed in 2013, obstructs a overland trafficking route into Israel Israel has made efforts to prevent trafficking in persons. The Immigration Police has run a radio campaign warning employers not to exploit migrant workers. The Ministry of Education and the Authority for the Advancement of the Status of Women has also conducted awareness campaigns in the school system that included seminars for administrators and teachers on sex trafficking. This program focused on the role of the school system in reducing demand for commercial sexual services. The 2011 documentary film \\"The Price of Sex\\" (priceofsex.org) was screened at the Jerusalem Cinematheque on 8 March 2013.

The Estonian coastal dialects were spoken on the coastal strip of Estonia from Tallinn to river Narva. It has very few speakers left nowadays. Treating the northeastern coastal dialect as a single unit dates back to Arnold Kask's classification of Estonian dialects from the year 1956).Karl Pajusalu, Tiit Hennoste, Ellen Niit, Peeter P√§ll, J√ºri Viikberg \\"Eesti murded ja kohanimed\\", Tallinn 2002, lk 53 According to some authors, the coastal dialects form one of the three major dialect groups of Estonian (the other two being North Estonian and South Estonian).Such a division is used in Eesti n√µukogude ents√ºklopeedia, 2. kd, as well as by Mari Must On Eastern Viru languages . Other sources may group the coastal dialects as subdivision of Northern Estonian dialects or just as one of the dialect groups of the Estonian language, without a binary division into Northern and Southern Estonian (, ) Features The characteristics of the dialect group are mostly shared with the Northern Finnic languages. * There are remnants of vowel harmony (r√§b√§l√§ 'rag' (genitive case), cf. Standard Estonian r√§bala) * There is no palatalization * Short plosives are unvoiced unlike in other dialects of Estonian (m√§gi, cf. Finnish m√§ki) * Recent quantitative changes in consonant gradation are absent (silm : silmad , cf. Standard Estonian : , 'eye' : 'eyes') * The negative verb inflects for person and number: en, et, ei, emma, etta, evad. Cf. Standard Estonian 'ei' for all persons sg/pl), versus Finnish en, et, ei, emme, ette, eiv√§t. * The plural is marked with -i-, in contrast to -de- being usual in North Estonian dialects: puhti k√§siga, cf. Standard Estonian puhaste k√§tega, 'with clean hands' * The preterite is marked with -i- as well, in contrast to -si- being usual in North Estonian. * Unlike all other Estonian dialects, the coastal dialects have an inflected -nud participle, as in Finnish: (juobune piaga, cf. Standard Estonian joobnud peaga, literally 'with drunk head', [saab] surne s√µnumi, Standard Estonian [saab] surnu s√µnumi '[gets] the dead man's message'). According to some authors, the \\"Finnish- like\\" features of the coastal Estonian dialects are archaisms (conservative traits), rather than Finnish or Ingrian influence. The northeastern coastal dialect of Estonian is nowadays alternatively split into two dialects, the coastal dialect and the Alutaguse dialect, the former being more closely related to southern Finnish dialects (the sound √µ […§] is absent like in Finnish), the Ingrian (Izhorian) and Votic languages, whereas the latter has also been influenced by the central dialect of the Northern Estonian dialects.

He is the defensive coordinator for the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League (CFL). Previously, he was assistant coach and administrator at Auburn University. He worked for the Tigers football program since being hired by Tommy Tuberville in 1999, until he temporarily retired in 2014. CareerEarly coaching years = Lolley started his coaching career at the high school football level, receiving his first coaching position at South Choctaw Academy in Toxey, Alabama in 1977 before becoming the head coach at Warrior Academy in Eutaw the following season. He continued there until taking the position as defensive coordinator at Demopolis High School in 1982. In 1984, he was hired as head coach at Stevenson High School where he stayed until 1987. The following year, Lolley was hired by North Jackson High School, where he spent the next 10 years. The Chiefs enjoyed success under Lolley, advancing to the state playoffs every season including winning the 1993 Alabama High School Athletic Association (AHSAA) 4A state championship. =Auburn= In 1999, Lolley was hired by new head coach Tommy Tuberville to serve as a strength and conditioning coach at Auburn University. He received his first on-the-field coaching duties with the team in 2000 when he was promoted to coach outside linebackers under John Lovett before being reassigned to coach the defensive backs when new defensive coordinator Gene Chizik took over. During Lolley's tenure coaching Auburn's secondary, he helped the Tigers finish 13th in nation in scoring defense in 2002 and a 5th ranked defense in 2003. After a disappointing 2003 season, Auburn made some staff changes including reassigning Lolley to Director of NFL Relations (working with pro scouts and pro football teams), a position he served for the next five seasons. When coach Tuberville was fired following the 2008 season, Lolley was one of four staff members that were retained by new head coach Gene Chizik to help with recruiting. On February 15, 2009, Chizik announced Lolley had been promoted to cornerbacks coach. He split responsibilities coaching the Tigers secondary with Tommy Thigpen who was hired from North Carolina to coach safeties. While at Auburn, Lolley was on the coaching staff that won the 2011 Tostitos BCS National Championship Game. Following the 2011 season, Lolley return to an administrative job in the athletic department. In the Spring of 2014, Lolley retired from Auburn University. =CFL= Following his retirement from Auburn, Lolley joined the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League as their linebackers coach, where he coached for two seasons. He spent the 2016 season with the Saskatchewan Roughriders, also as linebackers coach. Lolley joined the Hamilton Tiger-Cats for the 2017 CFL season as their defensive run game coordinator and linebackers coach, but was promoted to defensive coordinator after the team started the 2017 season 0‚Äì6. He was not retained for the 2018 season. =Players coached= Lolley coached Thorpe Award winner Carlos Rogers and Junior Rosegreen, who both went on to earn All-America honors in 2004. During his two years, he coached numerous future NFL players including Rogers, Rosegreen, Will Herring, Kevin Hobbs, Roderick Hood, Travaris Robinson, Horace Willis and Walter McFadden. Personal life Lolley graduated with a bachelor's degree from the University of West Alabama in 1977 and a master's degree in 1981. He has a son, Brad, and daughter, Brittany.

The Centre operates within the university‚Äôs Division of Epidemiology and Public Health Sciences, and is led by a steering group chaired by a principal investigator. CGH seeks to engage with a global agenda on health research and practice, addressing critical issues in global health and facilitating collaboration between and within the North and South. The Centre‚Äôs long-term research programme has been developed against a background of international epidemiological research, as well as public health work within Sweden. It publishes the open-access academic journal Global Health Action.  Research  Research conducted within UCGHR is interdisciplinary in nature, with staff and students working together from backgrounds in demography, public health sciences, epidemiology, medicine, economics, statistics and sociology. Research activities are clustered around five areas of expertise: *The epidemiological transition - research aims to contribute to theoretical and methodological development of the epidemiological transition theoryOmran, A.R.

Often, users are uncertain about their exact medical situations, are unfamiliar with medical terminology, and hence have difficulty in coming up with the right search keywords.Luo and Tang, ICPR 2008 An intelligent medical search engine is specifically designed to address this challenge. It uses several techniques to improve its usability and search result quality. First, it uses an interactive questionnaire-based query interface to guide users to provide the most important information about their situations. Users perform search by selecting symptoms and answering questions rather than by typing keyword queries. Second, it uses medical knowledge (e.g., diagnostic decision trees) to automatically form multiple queries from a user' answers to the questions. These queries are used to perform search simultaneously. Third, it provides various kinds of help functions.Luo and Tang, SIGIR 2008; Luo, AAAI 2008 For instance, if a user has made incorrect selections, does not know which symptoms to select, or cannot answer a question, he or she can invoke the search engine's help functionality and describe his or her health situation there. Then he or she will see multiple lists of help information, e.g., one list for relevance of unselected symptoms, and another list for relevance of alternate responses (to his or her selections). The contents of those lists are ranked using medical knowledge and specially designed medical information retrieval techniques.

Operation Lighthouse (OPL) was an HIV/AIDS prevention programme implemented by Population Services International's India wing during January 2001 to December 2005 which deployed a set of integrated communication, advocacy and service provision strategies to decrease the spread of the HIV/AIDS epidemic among vulnerable groups, by focusing activities in 12 major port communities in India. Funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), OPL focused on desired behaviour change outcomes in the areas of increased condom usage, partner reduction, increased Sexually Transmitted Infection treatment and increased usage of voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) services. The program targeted communication activities, mobile or conveniently-located VCT facilities for vulnerable populations, and a ground-breaking mass media campaign targeted to men in Mumbai titled ‚Äì \\"Balbir Pasha ko AIDS hoga kya?\\" (Hindi: Will Balbir Pasha get AIDS?). Considering the nature of the HIV epidemic in India, OPL focused on high-risk adult males because of their potential to infect their wives and girlfriends in the general population. Among this group, medium to high exposure to OPL activities is correlated with a decrease in non-spousal sex and increased condom use with non-spousal partners. Geographic focus The campaign focused on the port cities of the states of Gujarat, Goa, Karnataka, West Bengal, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, and Maharashtra. The port cities included: Kandla, Margao, Mangalore, Kolkata, Cochin, Tuticorin, Chennai, Vishakhapatnam, Haldia, Paradip, Mumbai and Vashi. Balbir Pasha campaign Through a mixture of outdoor communications, television and radio messaging, and comprehensive newspaper exposure, a fictional character named Balbir Pasha was portrayed in various scenarios, serving as a behavioral model for consumers of Mumbai mass media to relate to, learn from, and empathise with. By gradually unraveling each of the Balbir Pasha scenarios in an approachable and familiar manner, the campaign succeeded in building interest, personalising HIV risk, and bringing the topic of HIV/AIDS into the public sphere. Indicators of success for the Balbir Pasha communications campaign to reduce HIV/AIDS prevalence in India have been observed as follows: *increased risk perception among those exposed to the campaign *increased tendency to discuss HIV/AIDS with others *increase in number of people accessing HIV/AIDS prevention products and services. Elements of the campaign that contributed to its \\"success\\" include: *it was based on an in-depth study of the target consumer *it built up interest through a preceding teaser campaign *a variety of communication media were utilised *each phase of the campaign was linked with on-the-ground activities *the infiltration of Balbir Pasha into street- talk, independent art projects, other advertising campaigns, etc. provided a \\"hook\\" for the target consumer to relate to and personalise HIV risk *although criticised by some for their relative frankness, PSI managed to deliver HIV/AIDS messages in a way that spoke directly to the target consumer.

The term refers in particular to members of the British Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), a women-only movement founded in 1903 by Emmeline Pankhurst, which engaged in direct action and civil disobedience.Strachey, Ray (1928). The Cause: A Short History of the Women's Movement in Great Britain, p. 302. In 1906, a reporter writing in the Daily Mail coined the term suffragette for the WSPU, from suffragist, to belittle the women advocating women's suffrage. The militants embraced the new name, even adopting it for use as the title of the newspaper published by the WSPU. Women had won the right to vote in several countries by the end of the 19th century; in 1893, New Zealand became the first self-governing country to grant the vote to all women over the age of 21. When by 1903 women in Britain had not been enfranchised, Pankhurst decided that women had to \\"do the work ourselves\\";Pankhurst, Christabel (1959). Unshackled: The Story of How We Won the Vote. London: Hutchison, p. 43. the WSPU motto became \\"deeds, not words\\". The suffragettes heckled politicians, tried to storm parliament, were attacked and sexually assaulted during battles with the police, chained themselves to railings, smashed windows, set fire to postboxes and empty buildings, set bombs in order to damage churches and property, and faced anger and ridicule in the media. When imprisoned they went on hunger strike, to which the government responded by force-feeding them. The first suffragette to be force fed was Evaline Hilda Burkitt. The death of one suffragette, Emily Davison, when she ran in front of the king's horse at the 1913 Epsom Derby, made headlines around the world. The WSPU campaign had varying levels of support from within the suffragette movement; breakaway groups formed, and within the WSPU itself not all members supported the direct action. The suffragette campaign was suspended when World War I broke out in 1914. After the war, the Representation of the People Act 1918 gave the vote to women over the age of 30 who met certain property qualifications. Ten years later, women gained electoral equality with men when the Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928 gave all women the vote at age 21. BackgroundWomen's suffrage= Although the Isle of Man (a British Crown dependency) had enfranchised women who owned property to vote in parliamentary (Tynwald) elections in 1881, New Zealand was the first self- governing country to grant all women the right to vote in 1893, when women over the age of 21 were permitted to vote in all parliamentary elections.Harper, Ida Husted. History of Woman Suffrage, volume 6 (National American Woman Suffrage Association, 1922) p. 752. Women in South Australia achieved the same right and became the first to obtain the right to stand for parliament in 1895. In the United States, white women over the age of 21 were allowed to vote in the western territories of Wyoming from 1869 and in Utah from 1870. =British suffragettes= In 1865 John Stuart Mill was elected to Parliament on a platform that included votes for women, and in 1869 he published his essay in favour of equality of the sexes The Subjection of Women. Also in 1865, a women's discussion group, The Kensington Society, was formed. Following discussions on the subject of women's suffrage, the society formed a committee to draft a petition and gather signatures, which Mill agreed to present to Parliament once they had gathered 100 signatures. In October 1866, amateur scientist Lydia Becker attended a meeting of the National Association for the Promotion of Social Science held in Manchester and heard one of the organisors of the petition, Barbara Bodichon, read a paper entitled Reasons for the Enfranchisement of Women. Becker was inspired to help gather signatures around Manchester and to join the newly formed Manchester committee. Mill presented the petition to Parliament in 1866, by which time the supporters had gathered 1499 signatures, including those of Florence Nightingale, Harriet Martineau, Josephine Butler and Mary Somerville. In March 1867, Becker wrote an article for the Contemporary Review, in which she said: Two further petitions were presented to parliament in May 1867 and Mill also proposed an amendment to the 1867 Reform Act to give women the same political rights as men, but the amendment was treated with derision and defeated by 196 votes to 73. The Manchester Society for Women's suffrage was formed in January 1867, when Jacob Bright, Rev. S. A. Steinthal, Mrs. Gloyne, Max Kyllman and Elizabeth Wolstenholme met at the house of Dr. Louis Borchardt. Lydia Becker was made Secretary of the Society in February 1867 and Dr. Richard Pankhurst was one of the earliest members of the Executive Committee. An 1874 speaking event in Manchester organised by Becker, was attended by 14-year-old Emmeline Goulden, who was to become an ardent campaigner for women's rights, and later married Dr Pankhurst becoming known as Emmeline Pankhurst. During the summer of 1880, Becker visited the Isle of Man to address five public meetings on the subject of women's suffrage to audiences mainly composed of women. These speeches instilled in the Manx women a determination to secure the franchise, and on 31 January 1881, women on the island who owned property in their own right were given the vote. =Formation of the WSPU= Emmeline Pankhurst founded the WSPU in 1903 and became the most prominent of Britain's suffragettes. In Manchester, the Women's Suffrage Committee had been formed in 1867 to work with the Independent Labour Party (ILP) to secure votes for women, but, although the local ILP were very supportive, nationally the party were more interested in securing the franchise for working-class men and refused to make women's suffrage a priority. In 1897, the Manchester Women's Suffrage committee had merged with the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS) but Emmeline Pankhurst, who was a member of the original Manchester committee, and her eldest daughter Christabel had become impatient with the ILP, and on 10 October 1903, Emmeline Pankhurst held a meeting at her home in Manchester to form a breakaway group, the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU). From the outset, the WSPU was determined to move away from the staid campaign methods of NUWSS and instead take more positive action: The term \\"suffragette\\" was first used in 1906 as a term of derision by the journalist Charles E. Hands in the London Daily Mail to describe activists in the movement for women's suffrage, in particular members of the WSPU..Walsh, Ben. GCSE Modern World History second edition (Hodder Murray, 2008) p. 60.\\"Mr. Balfour and the 'Suffragettes.' Hecklers Disarmed by the Ex-Premier's Patience.\\" Daily Mail, 10 January 1906, p. 5\\\\. But the women he intended to ridicule embraced the term, saying \\"suffraGETtes\\" (hardening the 'g'), implying not only that they wanted the vote, but that they intended to 'get' it.Colmore, Gertrude. Suffragette Sally. Broadview Press, 2007, p. 14 WSPU campaigns Annie Kenney and Christabel Pankhurst of the WSPU, c. 1908 At a political meeting in Manchester in 1905, Christabel Pankhurst and millworker, Annie Kenney, disrupted speeches by prominent Liberals Winston Churchill and Sir Edward Grey, asking where Churchill and Grey stood with regards to women's political rights. At a time when political meetings were only attended by men and speakers were expected to be given the courtesy of expounding their views without interruption, the audience were outraged, and when the women unfurled a \\"Votes for Women\\" banner they were both arrested for a technical assault on a policeman. When Pankhurst and Kenny appeared in court they both refused to pay the fine imposed, preferring to go to prison in order to gain publicity for their cause. In July 1908 the WSPU hosted a large demonstration in Heaton Park, near Manchester with speakers on 13 separate platforms including Emmeline, Christabel and Adela Pankhurst. According to the Manchester Guardian: Stung by the stereotypical image of the strong minded woman in masculine clothes created by newspaper cartoonists, the suffragettes resolved to present a fashionable, feminine image when appearing in public. In 1908 the co-editor of the WSPU's newspaper, Votes for Women, Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence, designed the suffragettes' colour scheme of purple for loyalty and dignity, white for purity, and green for hope. Fashionable London shops Selfridges and Liberty sold tricolour-striped ribbon for hats, rosettes, badges and belts, as well as coloured garments, underwear, handbags, shoes, slippers and toilet soap. As membership of the WSPU grew it became fashionable for women to identify with the cause by wearing the colours, often discreetly in a small piece of jewellery or by carrying a heart-shaped vesta case and in December 1908 the London jewellers, Mappin & Webb, issued a catalogue of suffragette jewellery in time for the Christmas season. Sylvia Pankhurst said at the time: \\"Many suffragists spend more money on clothes than they can comfortably afford, rather than run the risk of being considered outr√©, and doing harm to the cause\\". In 1909 the WSPU presented specially commissioned pieces of jewellery to leading suffragettes, Emmeline Pankhurst and Louise Eates. The suffragettes also used other methods to publicise and raise money for the cause and from 1909, the \\"Pank-a-Squith\\" board game was sold by the WSPU. The name was derived from Pankhurst and the surname of Prime Minister H. H. Asquith, who was largely hated by the movement. The board game was set out in a spiral, and players were required to lead their suffragette figure from their home to parliament, past the obstacles faced from Prime Minister H. H. Asquith and the Liberal government. Also in 1909, suffragettes Daisy Solomon and Elspeth McClelland tried an innovative method of potentially obtaining a meeting with Asquith by sending themselves by Royal Mail courier post; however, Downing Street did not accept the parcel. Sophia Duleep Singh, the third daughter of the exiled Maharaja Duleep Singh, had made a trip from her home in London to India, in 1903, to see the celebrations for the accession of King Edward VII as emperor of India and was shocked by the brutality of life under British rule. On her return to the UK in 1909, Singh became an ardent supporter of the cause, selling suffragette newspapers outside her apartment at Hampton Court Palace, refusing to pay taxes, fighting with police at protests and attacking the prime minister's car. Emily Davison 1912 was a turning point for the suffragettes, as they turned to using more militant tactics and began a window-smashing campaign. Some members of the WSPU, including Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence and her husband Frederick, disagreed with this strategy but Christabel Pankhurst ignored their objections. In response to this, the Government ordered the arrest of the WSPU leaders and, although Christabel Pankhurst escaped to France, the Pethick-Lawrences were arrested, tried and sentenced to nine months' imprisonment. On their release, the Pethick-Lawrences began to speak out publicly against the window-smashing campaign, arguing that it would lose support for the cause, and eventually they were expelled from the WSPU. Having lost control of Votes for Women the WSPU began to publish their own newspaper under the title The Suffragette. The campaign was then escalated, with the suffragettes chaining themselves to railings, setting fire to post box contents, smashing windows and eventually detonating bombs. Some radical techniques used by the suffragettes were learned from Russian exiles from tsarism who had escaped to England.. In 1914, at least seven churches were bombed or set on fire across the United Kingdom, including Westminster Abbey, where an explosion aimed at destroying the 700-year-old Coronation Chair, only caused minor damage. Places that wealthy people, typically men, frequented were also burnt and destroyed whilst left unattended so that there was little risk to life, including cricket pavilions, horse-racing pavilions, churches, castles and the second homes of the wealthy. The also burnt the slogan \\"Votes for Women\\" into the grass of golf couses. Pinfold Manor in Surrey, which was being built for the Chancellor of the Exchequer, David Lloyd George, was targeted with two bombs on 19 February 1913, only one of which exploded, causing significant damage; in her memoirs, Sylvia Pankhurst said that Emily Davison had carried out the attack. There were 250 arson or destruction attacks in a six-month period in 1913 and in April the newspapers reported \\"What might have been the most serious outrage yet perpetrated by the Suffragettes\\": There are reports in the Parliamentary Papers which include lists of the 'incendiary devices', explosions, artwork destruction (including an axe attack upon a painting of The Duke of Wellington in the National Gallery), arson attacks, window-breaking, postbox burning and telegraph cable cutting, that took place during the most militant years, from 1910 to 1914. Both suffragettes and police spoke of a \\"Reign of Terror\\"; newspaper headlines referred to \\"Suffragette Terrorism\\". One suffragette, Emily Davison, died under the King's horse, Anmer, at The Derby on 4 June 1913. It is debated whether she was trying to pull down the horse, attach a suffragette scarf or banner to it, or commit suicide to become a martyr to the cause. However, recent analysis of the film of the event suggests that she was merely trying to attach a scarf to the horse, and the suicide theory seems unlikely as she was carrying a return train ticket from Epsom and had holiday plans with her sister in the near future. =Imprisonment= In the early 20th century until the outbreak of World War I, approximately one thousand suffragettes were imprisoned in Britain.. Most early incarcerations were for public order offences and failure to pay outstanding fines. While incarcerated, suffragettes lobbied to be considered political prisoners; with such a designation, suffragettes would be placed in the First Division as opposed to the Second or Third Division of the prison system, and as political prisoners would be granted certain freedoms and liberties not allotted to other prison divisions, such as being allowed frequent visits and being allowed to write books or articles. Because of a lack of consistency between the different courts, suffragettes would not necessarily be placed in the First Division and could be placed in the Second or Third Division, which enjoyed fewer liberties. This cause was taken up by the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), a large organisation in Britain, that lobbied for women's suffrage led by militant suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst.. The WSPU campaigned to get imprisoned suffragettes recognised as political prisoners. However, this campaign was largely unsuccessful. Citing a fear that the suffragettes becoming political prisoners would make for easy martyrdom,. and with thoughts from the courts and the Home Office that they were abusing the freedoms of the First Division to further the agenda of the WSPU,. suffragettes were placed in the Second Division, and in some cases the Third Division, in prisons, with no special privileges granted to them as a result. =Hunger strikes and force-feeding= Suffragette being force-fed Suffragettes were not recognised as political prisoners, and many of them staged hunger strikes while they were imprisoned. The first woman to refuse food was Marion Wallace Dunlop, a militant suffragette who was sentenced to a month in Holloway for vandalism in July 1909.Purvis, \\"Deeds, Not Words\\", 97 Without consulting suffragette leaders such as Pankhurst,. Dunlop refused food in protest at being denied political prisoner status. After a 92-hour hunger strike, and for fear of her becoming a martyr, the Home Secretary Herbert Gladstone decided to release her early on medical grounds. Dunlop's strategy was adopted by other suffragettes who were incarcerated.. It became common practice for suffragettes to refuse food in protest for not being designated as political prisoners, and as a result they would be released after a few days and could return to the \\"fighting line\\".. After a public backlash regarding the prison status of suffragettes, the rules of the divisions were amended. In March 1910, Rule 243A was introduced by the Home Secretary Winston Churchill, allowing prisoners in the Second and Third Divisions to be allowed certain privileges of the First Division, provided they were not convicted of a serious offence, effectively ending hunger strikes for two years.. Hunger strikes began again when Pankhurst was transferred from the Second Division to the First Division, inciting the other suffragettes to demonstrate regarding their prison status.. Winson Green Gaol, 18 September 1909; illustration from Mabel Capper's WSPU prisoner's scrapbook Militant suffragette demonstrations subsequently became more aggressive, and the British Government took action. Unwilling to release all the suffragettes refusing food in prison, in the autumn of 1909, the authorities began to adopt more drastic measures to manage the hunger-strikers. In September 1909, the Home Office became unwilling to release hunger-striking suffragettes before their sentence was served. Suffragettes became a liability because, if they were to die in custody, the prison would be responsible for their death. Prisons began the practice of force-feeding the hunger strikers through a tube, most commonly via a nostril or stomach tube or a stomach pump. Force-feeding had previously been practised in Britain but its use had been exclusively for patients in hospitals who were too unwell to eat or swallow food. Despite the practice being deemed safe by medical practitioners for sick patients, it posed health issues for the healthy suffragettes. The process of tube-feeding was strenuous without the consent of the hunger strikers, who were typically strapped down and force-fed via stomach or nostril tube, often with a considerable amount of force.Purvis, \\"Deeds, Not Words\\", 97. The process was painful, and after the practice was observed and studied by several physicians, it was deemed to cause both short- term damage to the circulatory system, digestive system and nervous system and long-term damage to the physical and mental health of the suffragettes.Williams, \\"Gags, funnels and tubes\\", 138. Some suffragettes who were force-fed developed pleurisy or pneumonia as a result of a misplaced tube.. Women who had gone on hunger strike in prison received a Hunger Strike Medal from the WSPU on their release.Beverley Cook, Six things you should know about the Suffragette hunger strikes - Museum of London website =Legislation= Cat and Mouse Act WSPU poster (1914) In April 1913, Reginald McKenna of the Home Office passed the Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill Health) Act 1913, or the Cat and Mouse Act as it was commonly known. The act made the hunger strikes legal, in that a suffragette would be temporarily released from prison when their health began to diminish, only to be readmitted when she regained her health to finish her sentence. The act enabled the British Government to be absolved of any blame resulting from death or harm due to the self-starvation of the striker and ensured that the suffragettes would be too ill and too weak to participate in demonstrative activities while not in custody. Most women continued hunger striking when they were readmitted to prison following their leave.. After the Act was introduced, force-feeding on a large scale was stopped and only women convicted of more serious crimes and considered likely to repeat their offences if released were force-fed.. =The Bodyguard= In early 1913 and in response to the Cat and Mouse Act, the WSPU instituted a secret society of women known as the \\"Bodyguard\\" whose role was to physically protect Emmeline Pankhurst and other prominent suffragettes from arrest and assault. Known members included Katherine Willoughby Marshall, Leonora Cohen and Gertrude Harding; Edith Margaret Garrud was their jujitsu trainer. The origin of the \\"Bodyguard\\" can be traced to a WSPU meeting at which Garrud spoke. As suffragettes speaking in public increasingly found themselves the target of violence and attempted assaults, learning jujitsu was a way for women to defend themselves against angry hecklers. Inciting incidents included Black Friday, during which a deputation of 300 suffragettes were physically prevented by police from entering the House of Commons, sparking a near-riot and allegations of both common and sexual assault. Members of the \\"Bodyguard\\" orchestrated the \\"escapes\\" of a number of fugitive suffragettes from police surveillance during 1913 and early 1914. They also participated in several violent actions against the police in defence of their leaders, notably including the \\"Battle of Glasgow\\" on 9 March 1914, when a group of about 30 Bodyguards brawled with about 50 police constables and detectives on the stage of St Andrew's Hall in Glasgow. The fight was witnessed by an audience of some 4500 people.Wilson, Gretchen With All Her Might: The Life of Gertrude Harding, Militant Suffragette (Holmes & Meier Publishing, April 1998) World War I At the commencement of World War I, the suffragette movement in Britain moved away from suffrage activities and focused on the war effort, and as a result, hunger strikes largely stopped.Williams, \\"Gags, funnels and tubes\\", 139. In August 1914, the British Government released all prisoners who had been incarcerated for suffrage activities on an amnesty,. with Pankhurst ending all militant suffrage activities soon after.. The suffragettes' focus on war work turned public opinion in favour of their eventual partial enfranchisement in 1918.Jones, J. Graham. \\"Lloyd George and the Suffragettes\\", National Library of Wales Journal (2003) 33#1 pp. 1‚Äì34 > Women eagerly volunteered to take on many traditional male roles ‚Äì leading > to a new view of what women were capable of.

Countess Markiewicz (1868‚Äì1927) The National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies, which had always employed \\"constitutional\\" methods, continued to lobby during the war years and compromises were worked out between the NUWSS and the coalition government.Cawood, Ian; McKinnon-Bell, David (2001). The First World War. p.71. Routledge 2001 On 6 February, the Representation of the People Act 1918 was passed, enfranchising all men over 21 years of age and women over the age of 30 who met minimum property qualifications, gaining the right to vote for about 8.4 million women. In November 1918, the Parliament (Qualification of Women) Act 1918 was passed, allowing women to be elected into parliament.Fawcett, Millicent Garrett. The Women's Victory ‚Äì and After. p.170. Cambridge University Press The Representation of the People Act 1928 extended the voting franchise to all women over the age of 21, granting women the vote on the same terms that men had gained ten years earlier.Stearns, Peter N. (2008). In 1979 the first British women prime minister Margaret came. The Oxford encyclopedia of the modern world, Volume 7. p.160. Oxford University Press, 2008 1918 general election, women Members of Parliament The 1918 general election, the first general election to be held after the Representation of the People Act 1918, was the first in which some women (property owners older than 30) could vote. At that election, the first woman to be elected an MP was Constance Markievicz but, in line with Sinn F√©in abstentionist policy, she declined to take her seat in the British House of Commons. The first woman to do so was Nancy Astor, Viscountess Astor, following a by-election in November 1919. Legacy Nineteen-year-old Fay Hubbard selling suffragette papers in New York, 1910 In the autumn of 1913 Emmeline Pankhurst had sailed to the US to embark on a lecture tour to publicise the message of the WSPU and to raise money for the treatment of her son, Harry, who was gravely ill. By this time the suffragettes' tactics of civil disorder were being used by American militants Alice Paul and Lucy Burns, both of whom had campaigned with the WSPU in London. As in the UK, the suffrage movement in America was divided into two disparate groups, with the National American Woman Suffrage Association representing the more militant campaign and the International Women's Suffrage Alliance taking a more cautious and pragmatic approach Although the publicity surrounding Pankhurst's visit and the militant tactics used by her followers gave a welcome boost to the campaign, the majority of women in the US preferred the more respected label of \\"suffragist\\" to the title \\"suffragette\\" adopted by the militants. Many suffragists at the time, and some historians since, have argued that the actions of the militant suffragettes damaged their cause. Opponents at the time saw evidence that women were too emotional and could not think as logically as men.... Historians generally argue that the first stage of the militant suffragette movement under the Pankhursts in 1906 had a dramatic mobilizing effect on the suffrage movement. Women were thrilled and supportive of an actual revolt in the streets. The membership of the militant WSPU and the older NUWSS overlapped and were mutually supportive. However, a system of publicity, Ensor argues, had to continue to escalate to maintain its high visibility in the media. The hunger strikes and force-feeding did that, but the Pankhursts refused any advice and escalated their tactics. They turned to systematic disruption of Liberal Party meetings as well as physical violence in terms of damaging public buildings and arson. Searle says the methods of the suffragettes harmed the Liberal Party but failed to advance women's suffrage. When the Pankhursts decided to stop their militancy at the start of the war and enthusiastically support the war effort, the movement split and their leadership role ended. Suffrage came four years later, but the feminist movement in Britain permanently abandoned the militant tactics that had made the suffragettes famous.Ensor, Robert, England: 1870‚Äì1914 (1936) pp 398‚Äì99Searley, G.R., A New England? Peace and War 1886‚Äì1918 (2004) pp 456‚Äì70. quote p 468 After Emmeline Pankhurst's death in 1928, money was raised to commission a statue, and on 6 March 1930 the statue in Victoria Tower Gardens was unveiled. A crowd of radicals, former suffragettes and national dignitaries gathered as former Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin presented the memorial to the public. In his address, Baldwin declared: \\"I say with no fear of contradiction, that whatever view posterity may take, Mrs. Pankhurst has won for herself a niche in the Temple of Fame which will last for all time\\". In 1929 a portrait of Emmeline Pankhurst was added to the National Portrait Gallery's collection. In 1987 her former home at 62 Nelson Street, Manchester, the birthplace of the WSPU, and the adjoining Edwardian villa (no. 60) were opened as the Pankhurst Centre, a women-only space and museum dedicated to the suffragette movement. Christabel Pankhurst was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1936, and after her death in 1958 a permanent memorial was installed next to the statue of her mother. The memorial to Christabel Pankhurst consists of a low stone screen flanking her mother's statue with a bronze medallion plaque depicting her profile at one end of the screen paired with a second plaque depicting the \\"prison brooch\\" or \\"badge\\" of the WSPU at the other end.Holloway brooch, Parliament of the United Kingdom The unveiling of this dual memorial was performed on 13 July 1959 by the Lord Chancellor, Lord Kilmuir. In 1903, the Australian suffragist Vida Goldstein adopted the WSPU colours for her campaign for the Senate in 1910 but got them slightly wrong since she thought that they were purple, green and lavender. Goldstein had visited England in 1911 at the behest of the WSPU. Her speeches around the country drew huge crowds and her tour was touted as \\"the biggest thing that has happened in the women movement for sometime in England\\".Henry, Alice (1911) Vida Goldstein Papers, 1902‚Äì1919. LTL:V MSS 7865 The correct colours were used for her campaign for Kooyong in 1913 and also for the flag of the Women's Peace Army, which she established during World War I to oppose conscription. During International Women's Year in 1975 the BBC series about the suffragettes, Shoulder to Shoulder, was screened across Australia and Elizabeth Reid, Women's Adviser to Prime Minister Gough Whitlam directed that the WSPU colours be used for the International Women's Year symbol. They were also used for a first-day cover and postage stamp released by Australia Post in March 1975. The colours have since been adopted by government bodies such as the National Women's Advisory Council and organisations such as Women's Electoral Lobby and other women's services such as domestic violence refuges and are much in evidence each year on International Women's day. The colours of green and heliotrope (purple) were commissioned into a new coat of arms for Edge Hill University in Lancashire in 2006, symbolising the university's early commitment to the equality of women through its beginnings as a women-only college. During the 1960s the memory of the suffragettes was kept alive in the public consciousness by portrayals in film, such as the character Mrs Winifred Banks in the 1964 Disney musical film Mary Poppins who sings the song Sister Suffragette and Maggie DuBois in the 1965 film The Great Race. In 1974 The BBC TV series Shoulder to Shoulder portraying events in the British militant suffrage movement, concentrating on the lives of members of the Pankhurst family was shown around the world. And in the 21st century the story of the suffragettes was brought to a new generation in the BBC television series Up the Women, the 2015 graphic novel trilogy Suffrajitsu: Mrs. Pankhurst's Amazons and the 2015 film Suffragette. In February 2019, female Democrat members of the US Congress dressed predominantly in white when attending President Trump's State of the Union address. The choice of one of the colours associated with the suffragettes was to signify the women's solidarity.

In 2012, it made Spain a late participant in the European sovereign debt crisis when the country was unable to bail out its financial sector and had to apply for a ‚Ç¨100 billion rescue package provided by the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). The main cause of Spain's crisis was the housing bubble and the accompanying unsustainably high GDP growth rate. The ballooning tax revenues from the booming property investment and construction sectors kept the Spanish government's revenue in surplus, despite strong increases in expenditure, until 2007. The Spanish government supported the critical development by relaxing supervision of the financial sector and thereby allowing the banks to violate International Accounting Standards Board standards.. The banks in Spain were able to hide losses and earnings volatility, mislead regulators, analysts, and investors, and thereby finance the Spanish real estate bubble. The results of the crisis were devastating for Spain, including a strong economic downturn, a severe increase in unemployment, and bankruptcies of major companies. Even though some fundamental problems in the Spanish economy were already evident far ahead of the crisis, Spain continued the path of unsustainable property led growth when the ruling party changed in 2004. In these early times Spain had already a huge trade deficit, a loss of competitiveness against its main trading partners, an above-average inflation rate, house price increases, and a growing family indebtedness. During the third quarter of 2008 the national GDP contracted for the first time in 15 years, and, in February 2009, Spain (and other European economies) officially entered recession. The economy contracted 3.7% in 2009 and again in 2010 by 0.1%. It grew by 0.7% in 2011. By the 1st quarter of 2012, Spain was officially in recession once again. The Spanish government forecast a 1.7% drop for 2012. The provision of up to ‚Ç¨100 billion of rescue loans from eurozone funds was agreed by eurozone finance ministers on 9 June 2012. As of October 2012, the so-called Troika (European Commission, ECB and IMF) is in negotiations with Spain to establish an economic recovery program required for providing additional financial loans from ESM. In addition to applying for a ‚Ç¨100 billion bank recapitalization package in June 2012, Spain negotiated financial support from a \\"Precautionary Conditioned Credit Line\\" (PCCL) package. If Spain applies and receives a PCCL package, irrespective to what extent it subsequently decides to draw on this established credit line, this would at the same time immediately qualify the country to receive \\"free\\" additional financial support from ECB, in the form of some unlimited yield-lowering bond purchases. The turning point for the Spanish sovereign debt crisis occurred on 26 July 2012, when ECB President Mario Draghi said that the ECB was \\"ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro\\". Announced on 6 September 2012, the ECB's Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) program of unlimited purchases of short-term sovereign debt put the ECB's balance sheet behind the pledge. Speculative runs against Spanish sovereign debt were discouraged and 10-year bond yields stayed below the 6% level, approaching the 5% level by the end of 2012. Property bubble The residential real estate bubble saw real estate prices rise 200% from 1996 to 2007. ‚Ç¨651 billion was the mortgage debt of Spanish families in the second quarter of 2005 (this debt continued to grow at 25% per year ‚Äì 2001 through 2005, with 97% of mortgages at variable rate interest). In 2004, 509,293 new properties were built in Spain and in 2005 the number of new properties built was 528,754.\\"Number of new properties according to the Ministry of Housing in Spain\\" In a country with 16.5 million families, there were 22‚Äì24 million houses and 3‚Äì4 million empty houses. From all the houses built over the 2001‚Äì2007 period, \\"no less than 28%\\" were vacant as of late 2008. House ownership in Spain is above 80%. The desire to own one's own home was encouraged by governments in the 60s and 70s, and has thus become part of the Spanish psyche. In addition, tax regulation encourages ownership: 15% of mortgage payments are deductible from personal income taxes. Even more, the oldest apartments are controlled by non-inflation-adjusted rent-controls and eviction is slow, therefore discouraging renting. When the speculative bubble popped Spain became one of the worst affected countries. According to Eurostat, between June 2007 and June 2008, Spain has been the European country with the sharpest plunge in construction, with actual sales down an average 25.3%. So far, some regions have been more affected than others (Catalonia was ahead in this regard with a 42.2% sales plunge while sparsely populated regions like Extremadura were down a mere 1.7% over the same period). Banks offered 40-year mortgages and, more recently, 50-year mortgages. While some observers suggest that a soft landing will occur, others suggest that a crash in prices is probable. Lower home prices will allow low-income families and young people to enter the market; however, there is a strong perception that house prices never go down. As of August 2008, while new constructions have come virtually to a halt, prices have not had significant movements, neither up nor downwards. The national average price as of late 2008 is 2,095 euros/m2. Housing prices were projected to fall another 25%. Government protections allow banks to avoid marking-to-market to postpone losses. \\"Spanish housing prices are now falling at the fastest pace on record\\" dropping 15.2% over the last year. Mortgage holders must continue to pay the debt even after a foreclosure. Banks have begun to accept \\"deed-in-lieu deals\\" in which the debt is cancelled if the property is surrendered, allowing the bank to quickly sell and recoup a greater percentage of the loan or turn the property into a rental. Some developments resemble ghost towns. For instance, the town of Valdeluz was constructed for 30,000 people, but had a population of only 700 people in 2011. Ghost airports such as ‚Ç¨1.1 billion Ciudad Real Central Airport, Castell√≥n-Costa Azahar Airport and others were built. Prices Due to the lack of its own resources, Spain has to import all of its fossil fuels, which in a scenario of record prices added much pressure to the inflation rate. Thus, in June 2008 the inflation rate reached a 13-year high of 5.00%. Then, with the dramatic decrease of oil prices that happened in the second half of 2008 plus the confirmed burst of the property bubble, concerns quickly shifted to the risk of deflation instead, as Spain registered in January 2009 its lowest inflation rate in 40 years which was then followed in March 2009 by a negative inflation rate for the first time ever since this statistic was recorded. As of October 2010, the Spanish economy has continued to contract, resulting in decreasing GDP and increasing inflation. From 2011 to 2012 alone, prices rose 3.5% as compared to 2% in the United States. The rise in prices, combined with the recently implemented austerity measures and extremely high unemployment, are heavily impacting the livelihood of Spanish citizens. As the average wage decreases, the buying power of the money decreases as well. The frustration of this decreases in buying power has manifested in several, very large, worker demonstrations. Spanish banking system The Spanish banking system had been credited as one of the most solid and best equipped among all Western economies to cope with the worldwide liquidity crisis, thanks to the country's conservative banking rules and practices. Banks are required to have high capital provisions and demand various proofs and securities from intending borrowers. Nevertheless, this practice was greatly relaxed during the housing bubble, a trend to which the regulator (Banco de Espa√±a) turned a blind eye. Spain's unusual accounting standards, intended to smooth earnings over the business cycle, have misled regulators and analysts by hiding losses and earnings volatility. The accounting technique of \\"dynamic provisioning\\", which violated the standards set by the International Accounting Standards Board, obscured capital cushions until they were depleted, allowing the appearance of health as problems mounted. It was later revealed that nearly all the Spanish representatives in Congress had large investments in the housing sector, some owning up to twenty houses. Over time, more and more news has emerged about the informal alliance between Spanish central and regional governments, the banking sector (bear in mind for example the recent government pardon of the second in command at the Santander Bank, while all the major parties are strongly indebted with banks, and such debts are extended from time to time) which increased the bubble size over the years. Most regional semi-public savings banks (cajas) lent heavily to real estate companies that at the end of the bubble went bankrupt, then the cajas found themselves left with the collateral and properties of those companies, namely overpriced real state and residential-zoned land, now worthless, rendering the cajas in essence bankrupt. In stark contrast to countries like Ireland, no nationalization took place. Instead the problem was rolled-over with the extension of the remaining real estate companies debts, while the central government bailed once and again banks and cajas alike. For more than three years, there has been a steady process of bank concentration. Spain had the densest bank-office net in Europe, which led many bank employees to be dismissed. By contrast, the bank Board of Members have mostly kept their jobs, even those in merged entities. Golden parachutes have been prevalent: it has been speculated that this was because of fear that laid-off senior members would talk about the sector's rampant malpractice. To this date no bankers have been legally charged for having roles in this process. In May 2012 credit ratings of several Spanish banks were downgraded, some to \\"junk\\" status. The Bankia bank, the country's largest mortgage lender, was nationalized on 9 May, and on 25 May it announced that it would require a bailout of ‚Ç¨23.5 billion to cover losses from failed mortgages. In addition to Spanish banks, other European banks have a sizable presence in Spain. German banks lead with an exposure of $146 billion. Germany's Landesbanks \\"rushed in\\" during the early 2000s. Barclays, Deutsche Bank, and ING have large Spanish units. On 9 June 2012 Eurozone finance ministers agreed that Spanish banks would be provided with up to ‚Ç¨100 billion of rescue loans. This money is to be distributed via the Fund for Orderly Bank Restructuring, and that the exact amount to be loaned would be determined after audits of the banks. EC President Jose Manuel Barroso and vice-president Olli Rehn welcomed the move, praising the combination of a \\"thorough restructuring of the banking sector\\", structural reforms, and fiscal consolidation; U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner also welcomed the move. Recent bank stress tests will enable the Spanish government to make a formal request for the ‚Ç¨100 billion credit line. Further analysis and tests will be undertaken prior to restructuring and recapitalization over the next year. Restrictions on the credit line exempting funds from covering \\"legacy assets\\" suggests limits to the planned banking bailouts. In May 2012, Spanish banks lent ‚Ç¨1.66 trillion to the private sector and took in ‚Ç¨896 billion. Historically it would borrow the difference from foreign banks (i.e., interbank lending) but reduced access has led to a greater reliance on ECB loans. Spanish banks borrowed a record ‚Ç¨376 billion (net) from the ECB in July 2012. Depositors are fleeing Spanish banks; deposits have dropped 4.7% from June to July (2012) as money is moved abroad. On 28 November 2012, the European Commission approved the Spanish government's plan to shrink and restructure three major Spanish banks‚ÄîBankia, NCG Banco, and Catalunya Banc‚Äîand sell a fourth, Banco de Valencia. This is part of a ‚Ç¨37 billion EC bailout or restructuring approved in June. It includes loss-taking by investors of up to ‚Ç¨10 billion, the creation of a \\"bad bank\\" to absorb up to ‚Ç¨45 billion of failed loans, closing thousands of bank branches, and reducing staff. Employment crisis After having completed substantial improvements over the second half of the 1990s and during the 2000s, which put a few regions on the brink of full employment, Spain suffered a severe setback in October 2008, when it saw its unemployment rate surging to 1996 levels. Between October 2007 and October 2008, Spain had its unemployment rate climb 36%, exceeding by far the unemployment surge of past economic crises like 1993. In particular, in October 2008, Spain suffered its worst unemployment rise ever recorded and, the country has suffered Europe's biggest unemployment crisis during the 2008 crisis. Spain's unemployment rate hit 17.4% at the end of March 2009, with the jobless total now having doubled over the past 12 months, when two million people lost their jobs. In this same month, Spain had over 4 million people unemployed, By July 2009, it had shed 1.2 million jobs in one year and was to have the same number of jobless as France and Italy combined. By March 2012, Spain's unemployment rate reached 24.4%, twice the eurozone average. In 2012, unions organized a general strike to protest proposals to weaken union power, enable cuts in wages, and lower firing costs. By the end of 2012, Spain's unit labor costs improved. It narrowed the gap with Germany by 5.5% and 4.6% with respect to France. Spain's policy of internal devaluation cut public sector salaries by 5% with an additional 7.1% cut consisting of a suspension of the \\"14-month bonus\\". Spain, as in other southern European nations, relies heavily on the inter-generational family structure for a significant portion of the social safety net. Employment expectations should be adjusted for this cultural ethos. The unemployment rate for the \\"principal breadwinner\\" is 12.4% less than the 25% overall rate (June 2012.) Employment is also found in the underground economy, which is estimated to be as large as 20% of the economy during the boom years. :{class=wikitable +Unemployment rate (INE) - align=\\"center\\" !

Spain's current generation is considered the most educated that the country has ever had, yet it faces the greatest rate of unemployment in Europe. Roughly 68% of young people are willing to leave the country to search for a job, and those with college degrees are willing to settle for working at so-called minijobs for a paycheck. The State Secretary for Unemployment states that higher education is a way for the current generation to battle this issue; however, government cuts are occurring that slash university staff salaries and increase the number of students per class. For those paying their own way through college, the tough economy has made it nearly impossible to find a job and study simultaneously. Hopes for the future are dwindling as Spain's unemployment rate is almost as high as it was for the United States during the Great Depression. People are beginning to fear the transformation of this generation into one referred to as a \\"Lost Generation\\" that is constantly looking for work and whose futures are closed off from \\"good careers\\". The stress of unemployment has also affected personal relationships, with many young adults separating from partners. Youth unemployment is about double overall unemployment. The high unemployment rate, at 56% as of June 2013, is overstated. Subtracting students and young mothers not looking for jobs, the actual number is closer to 22%. = From immigration to emigration = Large-scale immigration continued throughout 2008 despite severe unemployment, but by 2011 the OECD confirmed that the total number of people leaving the country (Spaniards and non-Spaniards) had over taken the number of arrivals. Spain is now a net emigrant country. (this periodical appears to be more blog-like than journalistic) There are now indications that established immigrants have begun to leave, although many that have are still retaining a household in Spain due to the poor conditions that exist in their country of origin.  Tourism As the financial crisis was getting started in Spain, it was already underway in the United States and other western countries. The decrease in disposable income of consumers led to a sharp decrease in Spain's tourist industry, a rarity in a country with so many coastal towns. Indeed, the EU as a group saw a decline in tourists coming to their countries in 2008 and 2009, with ‚àí13% tourism growth in coastal Spain. Despite its traditional popularity with Korean and Japanese tourists, the relatively expensive cost of holidaying in Spain led many to pursue \\"sun and beach\\" Mediterranean getaways in Turkey, Spain's tourism rival.\\"Impact of Crisis on Tourism in Spain\\" , May 2009 However, Spain has also seen the largest growth in tourism since 2011 and 2012. Its geographic advantages, the Arab Spring, and other non-economic factors are contributing to its resurgence as a tourist destination. While Spain's economy itself is not doing well, purchasing power parity is generally rising again. Furthermore, violent unrest in North Africa and the Middle East is redirecting tourists towards stable countries like Spain.  Public debt  Spanish debt as % of GDP vs. Eurozone average, by year Spain entered crisis period with a relatively modest public debt of 36.2% of GDP. This was largely due to ballooning tax revenue from the housing bubble, which helped accommodate a decade of increased government spending without debt accumulation. In response to the crisis, Spain initiated an austerity program consisting primarily of tax increases. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy announced on 11 July 2012 ‚Ç¨65 billion of austerity, including cuts in wages and benefits and a VAT increase from 18% to 21%. The government eventually succeeded to reduce its budget deficit from 11.2% of GDP in 2009 to 8.5% in 2011 and it is expected to fall further to 5.4% in 2012. As of 15 June 2012, Spain's public debt stood at 72.1% of GDP, still less than the Euro-zone average of 88%. If Spain uses the ‚Ç¨100 billion credit line to bail out its banks, its debt will approach 90% of GDP. To avoid this, the EU has pledged to lend to banks directly although it now appears that the Spanish government may have to guarantee the loans. In June 2012, the Spanish 10-year government bond reached 7%, 5.44% over the German 10-year bond. As Spanish credit default swaps (CDS) hits a record high of 633 basis points and the 10-year bond yield at 7.5% (23 July 2012) Spain's economic minister travels to Germany to request that the ECB facilitate government bond purchases to \\"avoid an imminent financial collapse\\". Promised borrowing by the ECB has enabled Spain's 10-year yield to stay below or close to the 6% level and settling below the 5% level in the spring of 2013. In 2016, public debt reached 101% of GDP. Ratings For the third time in 13 months, Moody's Investors Service has cut Spain's rating. On 18 October 2011 Moody's Rating cut Spain's rating by 2 notches to A1 from Aa2 with the outlook remaining negative. Standard and Poor's has downgraded Spain on 14 October 2011 and Fitch Ratings cut it to the same level on 7 October 2011. On 14 June 2012, Moody's downgraded Spain to Baa3, just one notch above \\"junk\\". Standard and Poor's downgraded Spain to BBB- (one notch above junk) on 11 October 2012. DBRS downgraded Spain to single-A, which remains higher than the major credit rating agencies. This rating allows the ECB to use a lower margin for banks that borrow with Spanish debt as collateral. After a recent review, Moody's maintained Spain's investment-grade credit rating, removing the pressure on the country's debt. This decision by Moody's assures that Spanish bonds will continue to gain investor support; yields feel 5.50%, a level last seen in April. Although Moody's can still downgrade the country's ratings in the future, the decision to not downgrade will encourage the buying of Spain's bonds. 2012 financial bailout Demonstration in Madrid, 25 September 2012 On 9 June 2012 the Eurogroup held an emergency meeting to discuss how to inject capital into Spanish banks. The IMF estimated the capital needs of the Spanish banks to be about 40 billion euros. The Eurogroup announced intentions to provide up to 100 billion euro to the Fund for Orderly Bank Restructuring to the Spanish government. The Spanish government is then expected to give the appropriate amount of money to the respective banks. On 21 June 2012 it was decided that 62 billion euros would be shared among the Spanish banks in need. The European Union warned that rescued banks are subject to control and Union experts would meet stringent requirements. Since then, the country's borrowing costs have reached levels deemed unsustainable in the long run, raising the prospect of a second aid program for Madrid following the 100 billion euro lifeline it obtained for its banks in June. Spain expects the European Commission, to approve the restructuring plans of the banks needing aid on 15 November 2012 and then to authorize the disbursal of the first credit line of up to 100 billion euros within three weeks after that. A larger economy than other countries which have received bailout packages, Spain had considerable bargaining power regarding the terms of a bailout. Due to reforms already instituted by Spain's conservative government less stringent austerity requirements are included then was the case with earlier bailout packages for Ireland, Portugal, and Greece. As the EU's fifth largest economy, Spain remains a large concern. In 2011 Mariano Rajoy took over the government with his conservative views, pushing out Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez Zapatero and his left-wing views. Trying to get Spain out of the highest unemployment rate in the European Union was proven to be harder than expected. The bailout for Spain has been estimated to not be enough to restore the economy. There is a serious debt in the country, and substantial cuts would have to be put in place to restore the economy at this point. Many youths are trying to find jobs abroad, creating a problem for the future domestic economy and job market. Rajoy recently proposed a new budget for 2013 that would be very different and would cut government spending by 8.9%. By April 2013, unemployment had risen to 27%, but is now around 15% ‚Äì 16.1% as of February 2018 and is one of Europe's fastest growing economies, thus demonstrating that the country is improving. Separatist movements One effect of the financial crisis is an increase in support for independence in Catalonia. The Statute of Autonomy included a package of laws that gave more power to the region and would have recognized Catalonia as a nation, although one still within Spain. As with the rest of Spain, Catalonia has had high levels of unemployment. As many as 22% of the economically active population, which is still lower than Spain's national jobless rate, yet higher than Madrid. In 2010, Spain's Constitutional Court weakened the Statute of Autonomy for Catalonia, which further irritated Catalan secessionist organization. The 2015 regional election was the first to produce a majority for openly separatist parties. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy insisted that Spain's constitution does not allow a region to secede. Spain's Basque Country unsuccessfully tried to get such a move approved in Parliament in 2008. Catalan president Artur Mas instead scheduled an independence referendum for 2014, which was downgraded to being a more informal ballot after further intervention by the Constitutional Court. The dispute remains unresolved, as of March 2015.

It said that the strength of the effect of electricity passing through a wire varies inversely with the square root of its length and directly with the square root of its cross-sectional area, or, in modern terminology: ::I \\\\propto \\\\sqrt\\\\frac{A}{L} where I is electric current, A is the cross-sectional area of the wire, and L is the length of the wire. Barlow formulated his law in terms of the diameter d of a cylindrical wire. Since A is proportional to the square of d the law becomes I \\\\propto \\\\frac{d}{\\\\sqrt{L}} for cylindrical wires. Barlow undertook his experiments with the aim of determining whether long-distance telegraphy was feasible, and believed he proved that it was not. The publication of Barlow's law delayed research into telegraphy for several years, until 1831 when Joseph Henry and Philip Ten Eyck constructed a circuit 1,060 feet long, which used a large battery to activate an electromagnet. Barlow did not investigate the dependence of the current strength on electric tension (that is, voltage). He endeavoured to keep this constant, but admitted there was some variation. Barlow was not entirely certain that he had found the correct law, \\"the discrepancies are rather too great to enable us to say, with confidence, that such is the law in question.\\" In 1827, Georg Ohm published a different law in which current varies inversely with the wire's length, not its square root; that is, I \\\\propto \\\\frac{1}{c + L/A} where c is a constant dependent on the circuit setup. Ohm's law is now considered the correct law and Barlow's false. The law Barlow proposed was not in error due to poor measurement; in fact, it fits Barlow's careful measurements quite well. Heinrich Lenz pointed out that Ohm took into account \\"all the conducting resistances‚Ä¶of the circuit\\" whereas Barlow did not. Ohm explicitly included a term for what we would now call the internal resistance of the battery. Barlow did not have this term and approximated the results with a power law instead. Ohm's law in modern usage is rarely stated with this explicit term but nevertheless an awareness of it is necessary for a full understanding of the current in a circuit.

This divergence is approximately from the mouth of Observatory Inlet itself, near Nass Bay, which is the outer part of the estuary of the Nass River. At the head of Hastings Arm is the mouth of the Kshwan River, and the Nisga'a village-site of Kswan. Names The name of the inlet in the Nisga'a language, which is indigenous to this area, is K'alli Kshwan, meaning \\"upriver water teeth\\" literally, and which is a reference to the tribe's founder Tseemsim cupping his hands to take a drink from the Kshwan River and finding it so cold it hurt his teeth.

The club fields Gaelic football teams in competitions organized by the Mayo GAA county board. History The present club was founded in the early 1970s but there was a very long tradition of football in this area dating back to the founding of the GAA. Teams from the area competed under various names including Bohola, Foxford, Toomore, Killasser, Ballyvarry and the Foxford Geraldines in 1898. From the late 1880s football was played generally in the meadowlands along the River Moy at (Sraith Garbh) Shrahgarrow, close to the present field. Some matches were played in Aughaward in a field owned by Ryans known locally as Sraith Buach. Local teams affiliated to the East Mayo Board under a variety of names, Foxford, Toomore, Ballyvary, Bohola and latterly, Moy Davitts, an amalgamation of Bohola, Foxford and Straide. The necessity of acquiring a permanent playing pitch was recognised by Pat Conway, long-time Treasurer of Mayo County Board. The arrival of Fr Paddy Feeley to the parish and the involvement of a local committee, which included Tom Durkan and Dom Geoghegan, gave a new impetus to the efforts to find a suitable playing area. The original pitch was purchased in 1947 at a cost of ¬£400. A meeting took place in Foxford where ten people guaranteed ¬£40 each toward the purchase. By careful purchasing and the swapping of stripes of land, an area of some was eventually bought in the 1950s, and some development work commenced. In January 1974 a group of footballers and supporters from the Bohola, Straide and Foxford areas met at the old Bohola School then situated at the rear of the Parish Church. At that meeting it was decided to form a Bohola football club. The then Parish priest Fr Martin Mac Manus was installed as the first Chairman of the club with Joe McEvey as secretary and Willie Malee as treasurer. In its first year in existence the club won the Divisional Junior title defeating a fancied Charlestown, later defeating Lacken in the County Semi final and narrowly losing to Islandeady in the County final. The club then known as Bohola was promoted to Intermediate status for the coming 1975 season. Moy Davitts seems to have emerged organically from among the players of both clubs as much out of necessity as by any formal decision of either club's officers. There was no Junior club in Foxford at this time and players from the Foxford area tended to play for Ballyvarry or in some cases Knockmore. Bohola club was formed in 1974 and the Foxford players played for the Junior team, winning the East Mayo title and getting to the county final. Fielding two separate teams from among two small populations was difficult. The under-16s, minors and under-21s of Bohola and Foxford played together from 1976 onwards. This became the practice and eventually it was decided that a formal amalgamation was in the best interests of all the players. Following a meeting of the Foxford club Bohola GAA Club changed its name to Moy Davitts in 1977, a name which better represented the three parishes along the banks of the River Moy; Straide, native place of Michael Davitt; Bohola, birthplace of the Irish-American athlete Martin Sheridan, and Foxford, the birthplace of the great Argentinian Admiral William Brown.

The Microsoft Store offers Signature PCs and tablets like the Microsoft Surface, and offerings from third parties such as Acer, Dell, HP, Lenovo, and VAIO without demos nor trialware (pre-installed free trials of certain third-party software that expire after a limited time). It also offered Windows (most retail versions), Microsoft Office, and Xbox One game consoles, games, and services including on-site Xbox diagnostics. The Answers Desk helped to answer questions related to Office, Windows, and other Microsoft products; the stores also offer class sessions as well as individual appointments. The first two Microsoft Stores opened within a week of the Windows 7 launch, in Scottsdale, Arizona, and Mission Viejo, California. Additional stores have since opened in California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri, Texas, Virginia, and Washington. At the 2011 Professional Developers Conference, Microsoft announced that they intend to open 75 new stores in the next three years. The first store outside the U.S. (and the first of eight stores in Canada) opened in Toronto on November 16, 2012, while the first store outside North America (and first store in Asia- Pacific and second flagship store) opened in Sydney, Australia, on November 12, 2015. In September 2017, the company announced a store on Regent Street in London, England. On June 26, 2020, Microsoft announced that it would close all of its physical stores once coronavirus restrictions are lifted, and transition to a digital-only model. Four stores in New York City, Sydney, London, and Redmond would be renovated into \\"experience centers\\". History Microsoft's first retail store was located in the Metreon in San Francisco. It was owned and operated by Sony Retail Entertainment and ran from 1999 to 2001. In 2009, Microsoft built a \\"Retail Experience Center\\" in their Redmond, Washington headquarters and announced plans to build its own retail stores. On October 22, 2009, the same day as the Windows 7 launch, Microsoft opened a retail store in Scottsdale, Arizona. A week later, another opened in Mission Viejo, California. Five additional stores were opened in 2010. A ninth store opened in Atlanta in May 2011, with two more openings planned in Houston and Los Angeles by the end of June. The majority of Microsoft Stores were closed in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On June 26, 2020, Microsoft announced that it would permanently close all of its physical retail stores in favor of a digital marketplace. Four stores would be renovated into \\"experience centers\\": New York City, Sydney, London, and Redmond. Shopping experience The Microsoft Store is similar to the popular Apple Store concept, which has been largely successful. The concept aims to give a greater level of customer satisfaction both by only having sales staff as well as by employing \\"Technical Advisers\\" (similar to Apple's \\"Geniuses\\") to assist customers with technical questions and issues. In addition, \\"Specialists\\" (or trainers) are employed to show customers how to get the most out of their software. Xbox One consoles are also available to entertain patrons. Retail locations Map of Microsoft Store locations in the United States There are Microsoft Store retail locations throughout the US, seven in Canada, one in Sydney, Australia, and one in London, England. Microsoft Store formerly operated a store in Helsinki, Finland.  Other formats  Microsoft Specialty Stores = In May 2013, Microsoft began to launch mall kiosk locations known as Microsoft Specialty Stores, expanding upon the Surface- focused pop-up stores established during the launch of Windows 8. They featured a smaller product offering, with a particular focus on the Surface and Windows Phone product lines. In June 2019, Microsoft closed all Specialty Store locations. = Best Buy Windows Stores = On June 13, 2013, Microsoft announced a partnership with the Best Buy chain to replace their Best Buy's PC departments with The Windows Store (unrelated to the Windows Store software distribution platform) at 600 locations in the United States and Canada, by September 2013. The store-within-a-store showcases Windows devices, Microsoft hardware and software products (including the Office, Surface, and Xbox lines). Departments for other manufacturers (such as Apple, Google, and Samsung) remain separate from the Windows Store sections. Best Buy also pledged to add 1,200 Microsoft-trained sales associates to its stores and to stock more accessories for Microsoft-related products, such as Windows Phone devices.

Jacob Ungerer, c. 1900 Life Jacob Ungerer was born and died in Munich-Untersendling. On his father's side he descended from a family of Munich Cafetiers and brewery owners who had grown rich in the 19th century and who had become technical pioneers (for example, Jacob Ungerer's nephew August Ungerer who in 1886 installed the first Munich Tram Line). Jacob Ungerer's mother came from a glass blower family from Zwiesel. Ungerer's Matriculation register at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Munich 1858 After leaving school Jacob Ungerer started, in 1858, to study Art in the Antique Class of the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Munich, which he completed in 1864. (Matriculation number 1510). His teacher was the sculptor Max von Widnmann. From 1864 till 1866 he took a study trip to Italy, including a longer stay in Rome. After his return in 1866 he moved into his sculpto studio. In 1890 he became Professor for Sculpture at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Munich. Ungerer died 17 April 1920 in Munich. Almost all his artistic estate, among them many models, paintings and drawings, was destroyed in World War II during an air raid on Chemnitz.  Work  The Mende Fountain in Leipzig = In 1883 in Leipzig, Ungerer created the neo-Baroque figures for the monumental Mende Fountain which was donated by Marianne Pauline Mende. She was a rich widow said to have had a dubious establishment in Leipzig. The Mende Fountain is an allegory of the element Water, depicted as figures from Greek Mythology. The outer basin symbolises the Ocean, the dolphins on the edge are the mouths of rivers which let the water flow into the ocean. The Hippocamps - fable beings half horse, half fish - show the threatening and forceful sides of water. They are kept under control by the Tritons, the sons of Poseidon. The Nereids symbolise the peaceful relationship between water and humans - as a fruitful exchange, as a sign of the usefulness of water for humans. The obelisk as well as the Putti point up to the sky which grants water, in the form of rain, to Earth.

Economy and Culture, Leipzig), for the Royal Conservatory of Music (today the College of Music and Theatre \\"Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy\\" Leipzig) and for the old Grassi-Museum. = The Hamburg City Hall Sculptures = Martin Haller, architect of the Hamburg City Hall, asked Ungerer in a letter dated 1893 to create \\"a decorative, richly structured portal, the so called Bride Gate, to serve young couples as the entrance to the Registrar's Office, should they wish to take the first step into marriage in a more magnificent setting than that offered by our modest Registry Offices which are housed in dirty blocks of flats.\\" Under the God of Marriage Hymen, carrying two torches, there was to be, on the right of the entrance, Adam with his faithful dog and, on the left side Eve with the snake offering the apple. The whole was to be crowned by two turtle doves. Adam and Eve were to be shown ‚Äúnaturally in paradisical nakedness. As the genitals would then be at the eyelevel of onlookers it is recommended that these parts would be covered with a branch as in the naive manner of the Middle Ages.\\" (Source: STAHH 322-1RBK 149). The plans to install also \\"heads of Bluebeard and Xantippes with the insignia of knife and slipper\\", as a reminder to the couples, had to be dropped however. \\"The completion of this work which had been already started by the mason, was denied to us in the strongest terms because images of such horrors might have a negative influence on young couples, perhaps putting them off marriage altogether and would therefore be disadvantageous to the desired increase in the Hamburg population.\\" (Source: Martin Waller, about the building or the Hamburg City Hall, lecture held in the Society for Art and Science on 8th Nov. 1897, Hamburg). The figures for the Bridal Gate were completed in 1896. Apart from that Ungerer also created the statue of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, for the Emperors Gallery for the facade of Hamburg City Hall. Plans for a Registry Office in the City Hall were, however, turned down by the Hamburg Senate. Therefore, no bride ever walked through the Bridal Gate.

One of very few such blockhouses built in New Zealand, it is preserved as a Category I historic place. It was built in late 1860 as part of a larger Stockade and was one of two Blockhouses and Stockades built in the Hutt Valley that year. It was occupied by the Hutt Battalion of the Wellington Militia from December 1860 to May 1861 without coming under hostile attack. Originally built in a paddock at the end of Fortune Lane, that was later described as the \\"old Government Stockade\\" reserve; the Blockhouse can now be found at the end of Blockhouse Lane, off McHardie Street, adjacent to the sports fields within the grounds of Heretaunga College. Background In 1860, MƒÅori in the Otaki district were hostile, and there was also fear of raids from Wairarapa MƒÅori, leading settlers to petition for construction of a refuge. The disputed land sale at Waitara in Taranaki also heightened fear of unrest. In July 1860, after tenders had closed for constructing a Stockade and Blockhouse in Lower Hutt, Upper Hutt settlers formed a Volunteer Rifle Corps and petitioned the Wellington Militia for erection of a stockade in Upper Hutt, also. Construction The blockhouse was designed by Col. Thomas Mould and built towards the end of 1860. On 18 August 1860, Major W. Rawson Trafford, commanding Wellington Militia and Volunteers, announced that plans for a Stockade and Blockhouse to be built at the Upper Hutt, on McHardy's Clearing were available from the Royal Engineers office in Lower Hutt and that tenders for either one, or both closed at Noon on 5 September 1860. The successful tenderer, Mr W. Taylor, had previously constructed the Lower Hutt Blockhouse and Stockade. The frame of the two-story structure is made from timber and double-skinned with shingle infill, to protect it from rifle fire. Loopholes were also built into the blockhouse so defenders could return fire. The building was at one corner of a stockade formed by a perimeter earthwork with parapet and trench. A well and magazine were within the stockade. The stockade earthworks have since been removed and the surrounding land levelled during the construction of Heretaunga College in 1954. According to Best the blockhouse was never used as a refuge, but there are anecdotal reports of families retreating there one night in the late 1880s or early 1890s during an undefined emergency.New Zealand history forum The blockhouse has been subject to some modifications over the years. Originally the blockhouse did not have windows. Two upper level windows that were cut in the western end-wall before 1916 have been replaced by a single window, while on the inward facing walls, one upper level window has been enlarged and another added since 1916. The windows cut in the lower level of the inward facing walls have instead been covered up. Electric power, security lights, fire alarm and a sprinkler system are more recent additions, as are the metal gratings over the loopholes. The building has also been restored with a black stain applied to the wood and has red corrugated iron roof, a colour scheme similar to how the building would have looked in the 1860s. Use The Hutt Battalion of the Wellington Militia occupied the blockhouse and stockade from December 1860 until May 1861, without hostilities, according to the memorial plaque. By October 1861, the Bishop of Wellington was asking to rent the stockade from the Colonial Government for \\"a Sunday School and place of Divine Worship\\". Instead between 1861 and 1880, it was given over to the Police, for use as a residence, station and circuit courthouse. After the Upper Hutt Police Constable's position was retrenched in 1880, the blockhouse was still used occasionally as a public building. In July 1884, the School Committee asked to lease the stockade reserve from the Commissioner of Crown Lands. In 1891, the Police opened a new station at the corner of Main Road and Station Street, leaving the Blockhouse disused for many years. Twentieth century history A close- up of a loophole, built so defenders could shoot from within. Local people expressed interest in the conservation of the structure, and in 1916 the land was reserved under the Scenery Preservation Act 1908. This was one of the first instances of a historic building being accorded legal protection in New Zealand. In 1927-28 the building was significantly repaired and windows were added on the inner side of the L-shaped wall. A Committee to Restore the Blockhouse was formed during the 1950s and the building was restored about 1954. From 1953 to the late 1990s Boy Scouts and Girl Guides used the building. A service club also used the building as a meeting venue. In 1980 the blockhouse and the neighbouring land was classified as an historic reserve under the Reserves Act 1977. Soon after that, the New Zealand Historic Places Trust took over management of the building. The building was further modified around 1989.

It is located approximately southwest of the city of San Antonio de los Ba√±os, about southwest of Havana.  History  World War II = The station was built in 1942 and was first used by American forces on 29 August 1942. The U.S. forces called it \\"Cayuga\\" (named after the construction company hired by the U.S. to build it - the Cayuga construction company is named after the upstate New York Native American tribe by the same name). The first United States Army Air Forces aircraft arrived at the airfield on 16 October. It was used for antisubmarine patrols and as a training airfield for B-29 Superfortress aircrews who flew training missions from airfields in Nebraska and Kansas to the field. On September 9, 1942, Cuba and United States sign a new naval and Military Agreement of Cooperation for a second airfield that would later be known as San Julian Air Base. The Pinar del Rio area was considered ideally situated for further development and the Army began construction by expanding an existing Pan American World Airways emergency landing airfield on 1 November 1942. When construction was completed on 1 July 1943 the new facility was re-designated Naval Air Facility (NAF) San Julian. On November 1, 1942 the United States Army Air Forces set up postal operations for San Antonio de los Ba√±os using Army Post Office, Miami with the address: 632 APO MIA. From 1943-1945, major units assigned were: * 15th Antisubmarine Squadron (26th Antisubmarine Wing), 25 July-1 October 1943 (B-34 Ventura) * 23d Antisubmarine Squadron (26th Antisubmarine Wing), 28 February-24 April 1943 (A-29 Hudson) * 417th Bombardment Squadron (25th Bombardment Group), 13 April 1943-August 1943 (B-18 Bolo) * 314th Bombardment Wing (28 February-24 April 1945 (B-29 Superfortress) * Detachment: 89th Combat Crew Training Wing, 1943‚Äì1945 : Numerous B-17, B-24 and B-29 group air echelons deployed for training from 1943 through 1945 = Post-World War II = With the end of the war, the United States withdrew its military forces from the airfield and it was turned over to the Cuban government on 30 April 1946. After the handover it used by the Cuban Air Force. It was known as the Batista AAF (1953‚Äì1959). In a 1962 briefing paper on the Cuban Missile Crisis prepared by officials at the United States Department of Defense, the base was identified as \\"the headquarters for the Cuban revolutionary Air Force and the assembly point for all MIGs, except the MIG-21, which [had] previously been received in Cuba.\\" During the Cuban Missile Crisis, Soviet Armed Forces elements deployed as part of Operation Anadyr were based at the airfield. the 32nd Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment of the Soviet Air Forces, flying MiG-21F-13s, had elements there. Initially the regiment sent its 2nd Squadron from Santa Clara Air Base to San Antonio de los Ba√±os, and then later the whole regiment was concentrated at San Antonio de los Ba√±os.

Women and children are trafficked mainly from Nigeria, Romania, Bulgaria, Moldova, Albania, and Ukraine but also from Russia, South America, North and East Africa, the Middle East, China, and Uzbekistan. Chinese men and women are trafficked to Italy for the purpose of forced labor. Roma children continue to be trafficked for the purposes of sexual exploitation and forced begging. Reportedly, an increasing number of victims are trafficked for labor, mostly in the agricultural sector. According to one NGO, 90 percent of foreign seasonal workers are unregistered and two-thirds are in Italy illegally, rendering them vulnerable to trafficking. The top five source countries for agricultural workers are Romania, Pakistan, Albania, and Ivory Coast. Traffickers reportedly are moving victims more frequently within Italy, often keeping victims in major cities for only a few months at a time, in an attempt to evade police detection.\\"Italy\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2008. U.S. Department of State (June 4, 2008). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. The Government of Italy fully complies with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking. During the reporting period, the government aggressively prosecuted and convicted traffickers and continued to implement its progressive victim-centered approach for the rescue, reintegration, and repatriation of trafficking victims in Italy. U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 1\\" in 2017. Prosecution The Government of Italy continued its strong law enforcement efforts in 2007. Italy prohibits all forms of trafficking in persons through its Measures Against Trafficking in People law of 2003, which prescribes penalties on conviction of between eight and twenty years‚Äô imprisonment. These penalties are considered sufficiently stringent and are comparable with those prescribed for forcible sexual assault. The government‚Äôs 2006 legislation to expand its labor trafficking law and introduce new penalties for job recruiters remains in draft form. In a major case in April 2007, the courts sentenced four Italians and three Romanian human traffickers to between three and 12 years‚Äô imprisonment after they were convicted for the forced prostitution and exploitation of 200 Roma children between 2004 and 2006. In June 2007, the government prosecuted eight other perpetrators on charges of sexually exploiting children by coercing them into performing sexual acts in exchange for small gifts. Government investigations resulting from the previously reported large-scale anti-trafficking crackdown, ‚ÄúOperation Spartacus,‚Äù between October 2006 and January 2007, are reported to be still ongoing. In 2007 Italian prosecutors launched trafficking investigations against 1,202 individuals, prosecuted 80 trafficking cases, and the courts convicted 163 traffickers in. The average sentence was four years. The government reported that most traffickers remain in detention during the criminal proceedings. For sentences of more than two years, defendants are not eligible for suspended sentences. The government continued its prosecution of 19 traffickers from a 2006 case involving the trafficking of 113 Polish tomato pickers in Apulia who were exploited in forced labor conditions, and planned to begin to prosecute an additional four perpetrators in early 2008. After local Italian police were initially slow to respond, prosecutors and Carabinieri vigorously investigated allegations of official complicity when notified and found no evidence to support the allegations. According to an NGO based in Genoa working with Nigerian victims of human trafficking, some government officials have been imprisoned for facilitating trafficking. Protection The Italian government sustained strong efforts to protect trafficking victims during the reporting period. Article 18 of the anti-trafficking law allows authorities to grant residence permits and provide protection and job training services to victims of trafficking, and during the reporting period the government expanded Article 18 benefits to labor trafficking victims. The government allocated $3.75 million in 2007 for an additional emergency assistance plan and approved 23 projects implemented by NGOs. During the reporting period, it earmarked approximately $9.75 million for 65 victim assistance projects, although the government did not provide data on the number of trafficking victims who benefited from these projects or the number who entered social protection programs. In 2007, NGOs, with government funding, provided literacy courses for 588 victims and vocational training for 313, helped 436 find temporary jobs and 907 find permanent jobs. In 2007, the Ministry of Interior issued 1,009 residence permits to victims who assisted in a law enforcement investigation. The government also ensured the responsible return of 62 foreign trafficking victims in 2007 by funding their repatriation and reintegration and providing money for resettlement in their home countries. During the reporting period, the government implemented systematic procedures for victim identification among vulnerable populations in Italy. Despite the government‚Äôs efforts to identify all victims of trafficking, some, such as Nigerian women in commercial sexual exploitation, are still deported. Based on a 2006 independent commission report that its victim identification measures for immigrants arriving in boats from North Africa are not fully effective, the government reportedly improved its process for identifying trafficking victims and it now allows international organizations and NGOs to inspect detention facilities and to interview migrants. Victims who file complaints against traffickers usually do not face penalties for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of their being trafficked. In 2007, the government enacted guidelines for the identification of victims of forced labor and promoted four regional studies on victims of labor exploitation. Prevention The Government of Italy continued to educate the Italian public about trafficking through its funding of NGO awareness efforts, and it initiated a new ad campaign in 2007 that included TV spots, internet banners, and bumper stickers in various languages. In March 2007, the Ministry of Interior established a committee designed to improve oversight and prosecution of trafficking and invited NGOs into the policy making process by including their membership on this committee. The Ministry of Interior is in the planning stage of a public awareness campaign, with several other countries, to reduce demand for commercial sex acts and raise awareness about human trafficking called project Pentametro. The Italian Ministry of Defense reported regularly organizes training sessions on human rights and trafficking for both civilians and military personnel who serve in international peacekeeping missions abroad. The government contributed funding to the NGO ECPAT, which conducts child sex tourism prevention activities in Italy. In February 2007, police arrested a University professor in Naples for committing child sex tourism offenses while in Thailand.

After they are recruited, victims are coerced into prostitution. Sex tourism in resort areas has been identified as a problem. Jamaica is reported to be a destination country for women trafficked from the Dominican Republic, Russia, Eastern Europe, Cuba, to work in the sex trade. Some Jamaican women and girls have been trafficked to Canada, the United States, the Bahamas, and other Caribbean destinations for commercial sexual exploitation.\\"Jamaica\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2008. U.S. Department of State (4 June 2008). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. While the Government of Jamaica and numerous NGOs have endeavored to combat the problem, the response is widely viewed as lacking and inadequate. U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2\\" in 2017.  Modes of victimization  The majority of victims are poor Jamaican women and girls, and increasingly boys, who were trafficked from rural to urban and tourist areas for commercial sexual exploitation. Victims are typically recruited by family members or newspaper advertisements promoting work as spa attendants, masseuses, or dancers. After being recruited, victims are coerced into prostitution. Jamaican children also might be subjected to conditions of forced labor as domestic servants. Sex tourism in resort areas has been identified as a problem. Some trafficking of women from the Dominican Republic, Russia, Eastern Europe, Cuba, and Haiti into Jamaica‚Äôs sex trade has been reported. Some Jamaican women and girls have been trafficked to Canada, the United States, the Bahamas, and other Caribbean destinations for commercial sexual exploitation.  Efforts to combat human trafficking in Jamaica  The Government of Jamaica has undertaken efforts to combat human trafficking in the country. In 2016, the country was upgraded from a \\"Tier 2 Watch List\\" ranking to \\"Tier 2.\\" Despite these efforts and accomplishments, the United States Department of State, in its 2016 Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report, characterized these efforts as not fully meeting the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking outlined in the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. Nevertheless, members of the Jamaican Government have complained that differences in the criteria used to determine what crimes constitute trafficking in persons as opposed to, for instance, sexual exploitation, cause the TIP Report to paint an inaccurate portrait of the state of human trafficking in the country and the government's efforts to combat it. =Prosecution= Between 2007 and 2012, about 16 convictions for crimes constituting Trafficking in Persons were secured. The Government of Jamaica maintained anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts during the US State Department's reporting period, but did not punish any trafficking offenders. Legislatively, the government prohibits all forms of trafficking through its comprehensive Trafficking in Persons Act, which became effective on 1 March 2007, and which prescribes penalties of up to 10 years' imprisonment, penalties that are sufficiently stringent. This law also prohibits holding a person‚Äôs passport as a means of keeping an individual in labor or service. During the reporting period, the government charged four suspects with trafficking under its new law; these cases remain pending, in addition to six prosecutions from the previous year. The government did not convict or sentence any traffickers during the reporting period. The government also dedicated six police officers to the National Task Force against Trafficking in Persons, an inter-agency body that coordinates anti-trafficking activities, and reconstituted the organized-crime division of its police force to focus more attention on human trafficking crimes. A vetted police Airport Interdiction Task Force, created through a memorandum of understanding between Jamaica and the United States in 2005, investigates cases of drug trafficking and human trafficking at ports of entry. In conjunction with the International Organization for Migration (IOM), several police, consular, and judicial officials received anti-trafficking training. No reports of official complicity with human trafficking were received in 2007. In 2016, after a case of suspected jury interference, the director of public prosecutions recommended that individuals charged with human trafficking be tried by judge only. = Prevention = The Trafficking in Persons, Prevention, Suppression and Punishment Act became law in Jamaica in 2007, with the goal of identifying, sanctioning, and preventing human trafficking, and to assist and protecting vulnerable potential victims as well as those rescued from captivity. In 2014, C-TOC undertook an operation named 'Operation ID-Fix' with the goal of identifying links between sex shops and massage parlours and human trafficking, leading to the arrest of 41 individuals, including a proprietor, sex workers, and patrons. The campaign encompassed 31 tactical operations and identified and rescued 12 victims. In 2015, the Jamaica Constabulary Force implemented its Counter-Terrorism and Organized Crime (C-TOC) Investigation Branch with a unit dedicated to combating trafficking in persons. =Protection= During the State Department's reporting period, it was found that the government showed limited efforts to provide victims with access to medical, psychological, legal, or witness protection services. Specialized shelters for trafficking victims, especially for victims of commercial sexual exploitation, remained unavailable, although child trafficking victims had access to generalized government shelters for care. Shelter services for adult victims were said to be lacking, although adult victims were sometimes housed in hotels or other temporary facilities. Pursuant to its anti-trafficking statute, Jamaican authorities encouraged victims to assist in the investigation and prosecution of their traffickers. Victims were not penalized for immigration violations or other unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked. Jamaica provided temporary residency for foreign trafficking victims and other legal alternatives to deportation to countries where victims would face hardship or retribution. In 2007, the government assisted IOM‚Äôs repatriation of a trafficking victim from Burma who had been exploited for five years as a domestic servant. Prevention in this Activity The government increased anti-trafficking prevention activities during the period covered by the US State Department report. Government officials condemned human trafficking in public statements and presentations, in addition to warning more than 250 students about the dangers of human trafficking. Anti-trafficking flyers and materials were disseminated widely. The government also tightened issuance of exotic dancer permits to Jamaican hotel establishments, and eliminated their use in night clubs. Efforts to identify victims of trafficking among holders of these permits were intensified during the reporting period, and the government reduced the total number of permits to eight. The report suggested that increased government collaboration with Jamaica‚Äôs hotel and tourism industry would assist efforts to prevent child sex tourism in resort areas; despite reported sexual exploitation of Jamaican children by foreign tourists, no investigations or prosecutions of such suspected criminal activity were reported by the government. The report recognized the government's efforts to address the demand for commercial sex acts by conducting high-profile raids on hotels and nightclubs.

Women from Southeast Asia and East Africa voluntarily migrate to Jordan for employment among the estimated 50,000 foreign domestic workers in the country; some domestic workers are subjected to forced labor. Many of these workers are unable to return to their home countries due to pending criminal charges against them or due to their inability to pay overstay penalties or plane fare home. Some migrant workers from Egypt‚Äîthe largest source of foreign labor in Jordan‚Äîexperience forced labor in the construction, service, and agricultural sectors. Syrians may face forced labor in the agricultural sector, while some refugee children are subjected to the worst forms of child labor. Men and women from throughout Asia migrate to work in factories in Jordan‚Äôs garment industry where some workers experience forced labor. Jordan‚Äôs sponsorship system places a significant amount of power in the hands of employers and recruitment agencies, preventing workers from switching employers or receiving adequate access to legal recourse in response to abuse. Some Sri Lankan women engaged in prostitution in the country may be trafficking victims. The Government of Jordan does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of human trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. During 2015, the government substantially increased efforts to prosecute and convict trafficking offenders, and continued to identify and refer to protection services an increased number of trafficking victims. Authorities also increased referrals of trafficking victims to a government- run shelter for gender-based violence (GBV) victims; as of early 2014, this shelter provided specific care for trafficking victims. Furthermore, in March 2015, the government completed construction of a shelter dedicated exclusively to trafficking victims, and was in the process of equipping and staffing the facility at the end of the reporting period; it was also in the process of drafting a national victim referral mechanism at the end of the reporting period. Though the government improved its law enforcement and victim identification and referral efforts, it did not systematically investigate potential cases of trafficking that involved withholding of passports and wages. Trafficking victims‚Äîparticularly domestic workers who ran away from abusive employers‚Äîcontinued to face arrest and imprisonment. U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2\\" in 2017. Prosecution The government has significantly increased law enforcement efforts to combat all forms of trafficking, including those involving the most vulnerable populations. The 2009 anti-human trafficking law prohibits all forms of sex and labor trafficking and prescribes penalties of six months‚Äô to 10 years‚Äô imprisonment for child trafficking, trafficking of women and girls, and forced prostitution; these penalties are sufficiently stringent, but not commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. Penalties prescribed for labor trafficking offenses are not sufficiently stringent; offenses against adult male victims that do not involve aggravating circumstances are limited to a minimum of six months‚Äô imprisonment and a fine. Jordan‚Äôs labor law assigns administrative penalties for labor violations committed against Jordanian or foreign workers, yet these penalties are not sufficiently stringent to deter the crime of human trafficking. The withholding of passports is a crime under Jordan‚Äôs passport law, which prescribes six months‚Äô to three years‚Äô imprisonment, as well as financial penalties. Protection The Jordanian government continues to make progress in its efforts to proactively identify and protect trafficking victims. The government identified 121 female and 40 male victims in 2014; this represents an increase from 90 victims identified in the previous reporting period. The government referred 122 potential victims to a government-run shelter for GBV victims, a local NGO-operated shelter, and an international organization; this was a significant increase from 46 victim referrals in 2013. In March 2015, the government completed construction of a shelter solely dedicated to protecting trafficking victims; however, it was not operational and a designated budget was being developed cooperatively between the government and an international organization at the end of the reporting period. The government began development of a national victim referral mechanism; in the interim, it continued to shelter victims at a GBV facility and to refer victims to services. During the reporting period, the joint anti-trafficking unit agreed to regularly refer trafficking victims to a local NGO for legal aid; in December 2014, the unit referred five victims as a result of the agreement. In early 2014, the government officially expanded the mandate of a shelter for GBV victims to formalize its assistance to trafficking victims; it could house up to 50 female victims of violence and offered medical, psycho-social, educational, and legal assistance. The joint anti-trafficking unit referred 31 cases to the shelter during the reporting period and demonstrated professionalism and sensitivity when handling trafficking cases. Prevention The government continued efforts to prevent trafficking. The anti-trafficking committee met twice during the reporting period and its technical committee met 10 times. In April 2014, the anti-trafficking committee published a report documenting Jordan‚Äôs anti-trafficking efforts from 2010 to 2014. The government continued to distribute anti-trafficking brochures to foreign migrants at border crossings, police stations, airports, and in the garment sector. The government did not report taking measures to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts or forced labor. The government did not provide specific anti-trafficking training or guidance for its diplomatic personnel. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported its finance department directly paid locally hired domestic staff of Jordanian diplomats posted abroad, in accordance with labor laws and wage rates in the host country. The government did not provide specific anti-trafficking training for its peacekeepers before their deployment abroad.

Trafficking in Persons Report 2008. U.S. Department of State (June 4, 2008). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. The Government of Kazakhstan does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. Kazakhstan demonstrated increasing efforts to combat trafficking over the previous year, specifically by improving efforts to convict and sentence traffickers to time in prison. The number of traffickers convicted in 2007 significantly increased, and the majority of convicted traffickers served adequate sentences in prison. The government also took steps to address government officials‚Äô complicity in trafficking. Kazakhstan allocated nearly $35,000 for victim assistance during 2007. U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2\\" in 2017. Sex trafficking Citizen and foreign women and girls have been victims of sex trafficking in Kazakhstan. They are raped and physically and psychologically harmed in brothels, businesses, hotels, homes, and other locations throughout the country. Prosecution The Kazakhstan government made significant progress in its anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts over the reporting period. Kazakhstan prohibits trafficking in persons for both labor and sexual exploitation through Articles 128, 133, 125(3)(b), 126(3)(b), and 270 of its penal code, which prescribe penalties of up to 15 years‚Äô imprisonment ‚Äì penalties sufficiently stringent and commensurate with those prescribed for other grave crimes, such as rape. Police conducted 22 trafficking investigations and initiated 16 prosecution cases in 2007, compared to 13 investigations and seven prosecutions in 2006. Courts convicted 19 trafficking offenders in 2007, a significant improvement from one conviction in 2006. Of the 19 convicted trafficking offenders, one was sentenced to 12 years‚Äô imprisonment, four were sentenced to 10 years‚Äô imprisonment, five were sentenced to seven years‚Äô imprisonment, four were sentenced to six years‚Äô imprisonment, two were sentenced to five years‚Äô imprisonment, and three were sentenced to three years‚Äô imprisonment. During the year there were reports of trafficking complicity of some border guards, migration police, prosecutors, and police. The government prosecuted three corrupt police officials, including the former head of the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Unit in Almaty. One officer was sentenced to six years and six months‚Äô imprisonment and two officers fled authorities and remained in hiding at the time of this report. Protection The government improved efforts to assist and protect victims during the year. The law provides that victims are not penalized for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked; however, NGOs continued to report that some victims, as the result of not being identified by authorities, were detained in jail and prevented from leaving the country for periods ranging from a few days to several months. NGOs reported that while law enforcement officials have improved their use of formal procedures to identify victims among vulnerable populations, some labor trafficking victims remain unidentified. In 2007, the police formally identified 87 victims of labor trafficking and 25 victims of commercial sexual exploitation. The government permitted identified victims to remain in Kazakhstan for the duration of the criminal investigation. Many victims refuse to testify for fear of retribution and Kazakhstan has not devoted sufficient resources to address the physical safety of the identified trafficking victim. Prevention The government conducted active public awareness efforts. In 2007, the government funded the production of approximately 3,000 booklets that were distributed by NGOs among groups vulnerable to trafficking, including people in rural areas and school children. The government provided at least $12,500 for anti-trafficking NGOs to conduct awareness campaigns during the reporting period. The government monitors formal migration patterns for evidence of trafficking. The government did not implement measures to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts during the reporting period. Kazakhstan has ratified the 2000 UN TIP Protocol in 2008.

In 2008 it was reported that Kenya's anti-trafficking efforts improved markedly over the reporting period, particularly through greater investigations of suspected trafficking cases.\\"Kenya\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2008. U.S. Department of State (4 June 2008). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2\\" in 2017. Their efforts remain uncoordinated and lack strong oversight, creating an environment conducive to trafficking. Prosecution The government failed to punish acts of trafficking during the reporting period, but demonstrated significantly increased law enforcement activity throughout the reporting period. Kenya does not prohibit all forms of trafficking, though it criminalises the trafficking of children and adults for sexual exploitation through its Sexual Offenses Act, enacted in July 2006, which prescribes penalties that are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with those for rape; however, the law is not yet widely used by prosecutors. The Employment Act of 2007 outlaws forced labour and contains additional statutes relevant to labour trafficking. In September 2007, relevant government agencies provided comments on a draft comprehensive human trafficking bill to the Attorney General‚Äôs office, which continues to work with NGOs to further refine the bill. Police opened investigations into a number of significant cases during the reporting period, including the suspected trafficking of children by two school teachers in Kirinyaga District. In October 2007, police in Malindi arrested an Italian national on suspicion of human trafficking, facilitating child prostitution, and drug trafficking. Upon the conclusion of a separate police investigation, two women were charged with child defilement and child prostitution after luring a 14-year-old girl to their home and forcing her into prostitution. Two children trafficked to Tanzania for forced labour were rescued by Kenyan officials and placed in a children's home; the investigation is ongoing as police believe the perpetrators are harbouring an additional 40 children and six adults in forced labour. Six people in Bomet District and Nandi District of Rift Valley Province were charged with the sale and trafficking of children. The Police Commissioner worked with Interpol to investigate the suspected trafficking of a Kenyan girl to the Netherlands and four children to Ireland. The Ministry of Home Affairs began, for the first time, collecting information on trafficking cases from the police, media, foreign governments, and UNODC. Corruption among law enforcement authorities and other public officials hampered efforts to bring traffickers to justice. Some anti-trafficking activists made credible claims that, in certain areas, police officials were complicit in trafficking activities. In 2010, Kenya passed the Counter-trafficking in persons act which criminalizes human trafficking. However, the act has been poorly implemented and has had little impact on curbing human trafficking.Regional Mixed Migration Secretariat Protection The government made efforts during the reporting period to improve protective services provided to trafficking victims. Kenyan officials removed 14 children from situations of trafficking in Nandi and placed them in a children's home. The government referred two additional trafficking victims to IOM for assistance during the reporting period, and ensured the well-being of a number of other victims. City Council Social Services Departments in Nairobi, Mombasa, and Kisumu operated shelters to rehabilitate street children vulnerable to forced labour and commercial sexual exploitation; the government provided services to children exploited in the commercial sex industry at these facilities. In partnership with an NGO, the Ministry of Home Affairs provided and refurbished a building to house a toll-free hotline that enables children and adults to report cases of child trafficking, labour, and abuse. Staff members were hired and trained to serve as counselors and refer callers to government and NGO service providers. In June 2007, the Department of Home Affairs‚Äô Children's Services Unit hired an additional 180 Chief Children's Officers; during the reporting period, several children's officers posted throughout the country were involved in trafficking investigations and provided counselling and follow-up to child trafficking victims. Fifteen newly appointed Kenyan ambassadors received a first-ever briefing on human trafficking at Kenya's Foreign Service Institute; preparations are underway for a comprehensive briefing from the Ministries of Labor and Home Affairs and IOM for mid-grade and junior officers on their responsibilities in assisting Kenyan victims abroad. The government encourages victims‚Äô assistance in the investigation and prosecution of trafficking crimes, and ensures that they are not inappropriately incarcerated or otherwise penalised for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked. The government does not, however, provide legal alternatives to the removal of victims to countries where they would face hardship or retribution. Prevention The Government of Kenya made significant progress in publicly highlighting the dangers of human trafficking and taking steps to combat it during the reporting period. On numerous occasions, senior government officials, including the Vice-President, spoke publicly about trafficking and attended many awareness-raising events, including the Day of the African Child in June. The Kenyan media, especially the government-owned Kenya Broadcasting Corporation, regularly reported cases of suspected human trafficking. In July 2007, the government established the National Steering Committee to Combat Human Trafficking under the leadership of the Ministry of Home Affairs. Its Sub-Committee appointed to draft a national action plan received two days of training from IOM, after which it convened three drafting sessions and presented an initial outline of the plan in October. Officers from the Ministries of Youth and Labor received anti-trafficking training at IOM workshops in November and December 2007. In July 2007, the Malindi District Commission established and chaired a district-level committee on child sex tourism. In June 2007, a German national was arrested and charged with sexually exploiting two trafficked children from Nyanza at Likoni Children's Home. There were no reports of the Kenyan government's efforts to provide anti-trafficking training for its troops before deployment on international peacekeeping missions. Non-governmental organizations such as Awareness Against Human Trafficking (HAART) are working on ending human trafficking in Kenya.

The government continued to demonstrate serious and sustained efforts during the reporting period; therefore South Korea remained on Tier 1. The government demonstrated serious and sustained efforts by identifying and providing services to a comparable number of victims relative to the previous reporting period, increasing inspections of entertainment businesses, and increasing efforts to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts. Although the government meets the minimum standards, it did not adequately address labor trafficking; the government investigated and prosecuted fewer cases, and penalized and deported trafficking victims due to inadequate identification efforts. U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 1\\" in 2018. Sex trafficking Despite (or because of) the illegality of prostitution in the country, sex trafficking is prevalent, encompassing the forced prostitution of more than a million South Korean women in red-light districts like Yong Ju Gol and other areas, not including women from other countries who have been trafficked into South Korea for the purpose of forced prostitution. Economic materialism in the country, which is visible in the sizable South Korean fashion and cosmetic industries, contributes to domestic human trafficking because many young women become burdened by significant debt, victimized by loan sharks, and overwhelmed with multiple credit cards to pay off. The women who find themselves in this situation are often targeted by traffickers who entice the women with the possibility of paying off their debt through prostitution, when, in actuality, the traffickers ensure that the women's debt never gets paid off. Sex trafficking victims in South Korea are often sold in kissing rooms, massage parlours, and karaoke bars. The majority of women enter sex work through job advertisements in newspaper, magazines, or the internet. Advertisements look like legitimate jobs, but women are required to engage in sex service once they are hired. Some women voluntarily enter for survival. Regardless of how they enter sex work, brothels abuse them economically, physically, and mentally. Procurers use debt bondage and lure women in with advance payments. They write employment contracts so that it is virtually impossible to pay back the debt. Contracts involve heavy penalties for failing to generate daily profits for owners. They eventually become stuck in increasing debt, and cannot get away from procurers. Prosecution The government maintained law enforcement efforts. Chapter 31 of the criminal code criminalized sex and labor trafficking and prescribed penalties of up to 15 years imprisonment for trafficking crimes, which were sufficiently stringent and, with respect to sex trafficking, commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. In 2017, the government reported investigating 448 reported trafficking cases (562 in 2016), indicting 327 suspects (426 in 2016), and convicting 127 offenders (127 in 2016). Police investigated three cases of forced labor involving disabled victims. The government did not initiate any prosecutions under the trafficking statute in 2017. Of those convicted, 42 received suspended sentences and three were sentenced to a fine. Law enforcement entities did not have dedicated anti-trafficking teams. The government cooperated with foreign governments in the investigation and prosecution of sex trafficking cases. The government held numerous trainings throughout the year for prosecutors and law enforcement officers on sex trafficking issues and victim protection; however, government trainings did not address labor trafficking. Officials‚Äô understanding of human trafficking continued to be limited and inconsistent; there remained widespread, false perceptions that kidnapping, buying and selling, physical force, or confinement were required to qualify a case as trafficking. As a result, law enforcement and prosecutors pursued most trafficking offenses under provisions of the law with the less severe penalties. A police officer who engaged in commercial sex acts with a child was convicted under the act on the protection of child and juveniles against sexual abuse and sentenced to a fine of 15 million Korean Won ($14,070) and 40 hours of ‚Äújohn school.‚Äù Protection The government maintained efforts to protect trafficking victims. The government identified and assisted 77 foreign sex trafficking victims, compared with 82 in 2016; comprehensive statistics for Korean or labor trafficking victims was unavailable; however the government reported identifying three labor trafficking victims and assisting 7,392 victims of sex trafficking or related crimes in 2017. The government continued to use and distribute guidelines established in 2013 to identify victims of sex trafficking but did not have guidelines to identify victims of labor trafficking. In 2016, the National Human Rights Commission distributed updated identification guidelines to government, but no agency had implemented these guidelines by the end of the reporting period. The Korean National Police Agency was responsible for guiding crime victims, including trafficking victims, from the initial point of contact with law enforcement to protection and support systems; however, the government did not issue or use formal guidelines for referring victims to services. The government did not report efforts to identify potential victims of trafficking aboard South Korean flagged fishing vessels. The Ministry of Gender Equality and Family (MOGEF) supported 96 facilities that provided services to female sex trafficking victims, in addition to victims of other types of crime. These facilities assisted trafficking victims through counseling services, shelter, education, and rehabilitation support. The government made some services offered through these facilities available to male victims, such as counseling, medical, and legal assistance. In addition, the government operated 31 counseling centers and shelters that trafficking victims with disabilities were able to access. Nonetheless, NGOs reported the quality of government services were not adequate for male, disabled, foreign, or juvenile victims. NGOs reported government officials lacked awareness of trafficking issues and did not utilize a victim-centered approach. As a result of ineffective identification procedures, authorities arrested, detained, and deported sex trafficking victims. Police and other government officials often treated female South Korean and foreign sex trafficking victims as criminals, rather than identifying them as trafficking victims. The government offered foreign victims legal alternatives to their removal to countries in which they may face hardship or retribution. As an incentive to encourage foreign trafficking victims to participate in investigations and prosecutions, the government issued G-1 visas with permission to work for up to one year. However, NGOs reported authorities often did not make victims aware of their eligibility for G-1 visas and sometimes deported victims without referring to services. Victims could file a civil suit to receive restitution, and some victims received compensation during the reporting period. Prevention The government increased efforts to prevent trafficking. To raise awareness, the government conducted public service announcements, advertising campaigns, and events; distributed materials online; and publicized its anti-trafficking hotline. The Inspection Team for Implementation of the National Action Plan for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights was responsible for coordinated governmental efforts to address sex trafficking but did not meet during the reporting period; there was no similar coordinating body for labor trafficking. In an effort to prevent exploitation among E6-2 entertainment visa holders, the government began to require visa holders to receive training on their rights and labor laws. In addition, MOGEF conducted inspections of 256 restaurants, bars, and illegal brothels (101 in 2016), and police arrested 323 building owners associated with illegal entertainment businesses. The Ministry of Employment and Labor (MOEL) inspected 20,000 workplaces for labor exploitation, in addition to 200 workplaces with high numbers of employees with disabilities and 3,069 businesses with foreign workers. The government found 7,053 violations in 1,510 workplaces with foreign workers (3,337 violations in 2016); MOEL instructed businesses to address violations, but it was unclear whether charges were brought against violators. MOEL provided interpretation and counseling services to migrant workers through 42 support centers that were partially funded by the government. The government did not operate a hotline specifically for reporting potential trafficking crimes, but MOGEF continued to operate hotlines in 13 languages that were accessible to trafficking victims, and the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries continued to operate a hotline for foreign crewmembers on South Korean fishing vessels. The government lacked a trafficking-specific national plan of action; its 2012 human rights national action plan included some anti-trafficking efforts. The government did not make efforts to reduce the demand for forced labor. To reduce the demand for commercial sex acts, in 2017 the government began to require chatting websites and mobile applications to display a notice about sex trafficking and prostitution laws; provided schools, government agencies, local governments, and state-run corporations with anti-prostitution and trafficking education programs; and publicized the illegality of child sex tourism in airports, train stations, and travel agencies. South Korean men remained a source of demand for child sex tourism in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. The government denied passport issuance to 11 South Koreans (four in 2016) for engagement in sex tourism abroad; the Gangwon Provincial Police arrested an individual suspected of operating a blog providing information to potential sex tourists. The government continued to provide anti-trafficking training to troops prior to and after their deployment abroad on international peacekeeping missions.

In addition, some women are forced into commercial sexual exploitation; for example, some female domestic workers are forced into prostitution after running away from abusive employers or after being deceived with promises of jobs in different sectors. Kuwait is also a transit country for South and East Asian workers recruited by Kuwaiti labor recruitment agencies for low-skilled work in Iraq; some of these workers are deceived as to the true location and nature of this work, while others willingly transit to Iraq through Kuwait, but subsequently endure conditions of involuntary servitude in Iraq. Some Kuwaiti nationals reportedly travel to destinations including Morocco, Egypt, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh to engage in commercial sex acts.\\"Kuwait\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2008. U.S. Department of State (June 4, 2008). The Government of Kuwait does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking, and is not making significant efforts to do so. U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2 Watchlist\\" in 2017. In 2019 Kuwait was placed in Tier 2. Prosecution The Government of Kuwait demonstrated no progress in punishing trafficking offenses this year. Kuwait does not explicitly prohibit trafficking in persons, though it prohibits transnational slavery through Article 185 of its criminal code, with a prescribed penalty of five years‚Äô imprisonment and a fine. Article 201 of Kuwait‚Äôs criminal code prohibits forced prostitution; prescribed penalties include imprisonment of up to five years or a fine for the forced prostitution of adults, and seven years‚Äô imprisonment and a fine prescribed for the forced prostitution of minors under 18 years of age. This year, Kuwait passed an administrative ban on withholding passports, but did not report any efforts to enforce it. Despite the availability of these statutes, the government did not report any prosecutions, convictions, or punishments of traffickers for forced labor, including fraudulent recruiters and abusive employers. Rather than assign stringent prison penalties for trafficking, Kuwaiti law enforcement efforts generally focus on administrative measures such as shutting down recruitment firms, issuing orders for employers to return withheld passports, or requiring employers pay back-wages. The government also did not provide evidence of prosecuting, convicting, or punishing traffickers for commercial sexual exploitation. In addition, credible reports indicate that government officials are complicit in unlawfully selling worker visas to labor recruiters, thereby facilitating trafficking. The government reported no prosecutions, convictions, or punishments for complicity in trafficking. The government did not provide specialized training to law enforcement officers, lawyers, or judges on investigating or prosecuting trafficking. Protection During the year, Kuwait made uneven efforts to improve protection for victims of trafficking. In September, the government opened a temporary shelter for victims of forced labor. The shelter has a maximum capacity of 40 women and provides medical, psychological, and legal services. It is unknown how many victims this shelter has accommodated to date. Credible sources report, however, that the shelter turns away victims who want to file complaints of trafficking or other abuses against their employers. The government continues to lack formal procedures for the systematic identification and protection of trafficking victims among vulnerable populations, such as foreign workers arrested without proper identity documents and women arrested for prostitution. As such, victims of trafficking are sometimes detained or deported for acts committed as a result of being trafficked, such as running away from their sponsors in violation of immigration laws and prostitution. Victims who are deported are not offered legal alternatives to their removal to countries in which they may face retribution. The police do not encourage victims to assist in criminal investigations of their traffickers. Government authorities often encourage victims to settle complaints against their employers out of court. In many cases, police do not take the complaints of trafficking victims seriously, and may also treat them as criminals for leaving their sponsors. Prevention Kuwait made no reported efforts to prevent trafficking in persons this year. The government did not produce any public awareness campaigns during the reporting period to warn employers and workers about the risks of trafficking. Kuwait also did not launch a public awareness campaign targeting citizens traveling to known child sex tourism destinations abroad. The government did not make any discernible efforts to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts.

The Board consists of approximately twenty private sector executives with experience in business management. The purpose of the Board is to provide independent advice, which reflects an outside private sector perspective, on best business practices for application to the Department. The Board‚Äôs objective is to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of organizational support to the nation's warfighters. The Board operates under the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act of 1972, as amended, and follows a Secretary of Defense approved charter available at the DoD Defense Business Board website. The Board members, to include the Board‚Äôs Chairperson, are appointed annually by the United States Secretary of Defense and do not receive any payments for their services. The Chairs of the Defense Policy Board and the Defense Science Board serve as non-voting ex officio members of the Board. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Comptroller General of the General Accounting Office serve as non-voting observers of the Board. In October 2014, Deputy Secretary Robert O. Work instructed the Board to hire consultants from McKinsey & Company to identify wasteful spending. McKinsey discovered DoD was spending $134 billion, 23% of its total budget, on back-office work, and that the back-office bureaucracy staff of over one million people was nearly as great as the number of active duty troops. On January 22, 2015, the Board then voted to adopt a McKinsey plan to cut $125 billion in waste over five years. After Secretary Chuck Hagel was replaced by Ash Carter the next month, however, Deputy Secretary Work expressed he was concerned that the gain from any savings achieved would then be removed from the defense budget by Congress. Under Secretary Frank Kendall III argued that he could not achieve any efficiencies and, instead, that he needed to hire 1,000 more staff. Secretary Carter then replaced the Board chairman, classified the McKinsey results as secret, and removed the report from public websites. In 2016 the DBB provided the model for the Defense Innovation Advisory Board which was established by Defense Secretary Carter during the 2016 during RSA cyber security conference in San Francisco.

Kyrgyz and foreign women are trafficked to the U.A.E., China, Kazakhstan, South Korea, Italy, Turkey, Greece, Cyprus, Thailand, Germany, and Syria for sexual exploitation.\\"Kyrgyzstan\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2008. U.S. Department of State (June 4, 2008). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. The Government of the Kyrgyz Republic does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. Although the government demonstrated some limited progress in collecting law enforcement data, complicity in trafficking of low-level government officials remained a concern. NGOs reported improved efforts by law enforcement personnel in referring victims for assistance. U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2\\" in 2017. Sex trafficking Citizen and foreign women and girls are victims of sex trafficking in Kyrgyzstan. They are raped and physically and physiologically harmed in brothels, hotels, homes, and other locations throughout the country. Prosecution The Kyrgyz government demonstrated limited law enforcement efforts during the reporting period. A 2005 law on Prevention and Combating Trafficking in Persons criminalizes trafficking for both sexual exploitation and forced labor; prescribed sentences range from three to 20 years‚Äô imprisonment, which are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with penalties prescribed for other grave crimes, such as rape. In 2007, the government conducted 33 investigations‚Äî19 of them pertaining to alleged labor trafficking crimes‚Äîcompared to 39 investigations in total in 2006. The government did not provide complete data on trafficking prosecutions, though authorities report the conviction of 23 trafficking offenders in 2007. Although the government was unable to provide complete sentencing data, some convicted traffickers served sentences ranging from five to eight years‚Äô imprisonment. NGOs contended that low-level law enforcement officials were complicit and accepted bribes from traffickers; other low-level police reportedly tolerated trafficking due to a lack of awareness. The government provided law enforcement personnel with trafficking- awareness training. Protection The government sustained modest efforts to assist victims during the reporting period. Although the government provided no direct funding for victim services or medical assistance, it continued to provide space for three shelters run by anti-trafficking NGOs. Law enforcement referred four victims to IOM and NGOs for assistance in 2007. In 2007, Kyrgyz citizens identified abroad and repatriated to Kyrgyzstan accounted for 134 of the total of 331 victims identified. Victims are encouraged to participate in trafficking investigations and prosecutions; victims who do not cooperate with law enforcement are potentially subject to being penalized for immigration violations and related offenses, although there were no reports of victims being penalized during the reporting period. The witness protection law, passed in 2006, continued to lack implementation procedures; as a result, no victims of crime‚Äîincluding trafficking victims‚Äî were protected by police in 2007. Prevention Kyrgyzstan demonstrated limited trafficking prevention efforts over the last year. The government continued to focus significant attention on migration issues and worked to improve protection for all Kyrgyz migrant workers abroad in Russia and other destination countries. The government continued to publish brochures and leaflets in Kyrgyz and Russian for those seeking work abroad warning of the dangers of trafficking and providing the number for IOM-operated trafficking assistance hot-lines in several countries. The government does not actively monitor immigration and emigration patterns for evidence of trafficking.

Laos‚Äô potential as a transit country is on the rise with the construction of new highways linking the People‚Äôs Republic of China, Vietnam, Thailand, and Cambodia through Laos.

U.S. Department of State (June 4, 2008). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. The Government of Laos does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however it is making significant efforts to do so. The government increased law enforcement efforts to investigate trafficking offenses and prosecute and punish trafficking offenders. It also increased collaboration with international organizations and civil society to provide training for government and law enforcement officials, to provide repatriation and reintegration services for victims, and to launch public awareness campaigns to combat trafficking. A severe lack of resources remains the biggest impediment to the government‚Äôs ability to combat trafficking in persons and it remains dependent on the international donor community to fund anti-trafficking activities. U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 3 Watchlist\\" in 2018. Sex trafficking Laos is mainly an origin country for sexually trafficked persons. A number of citizens, primarily women and girls, from all ethnic groups and foreigners have been victims of sex trafficking in Laos. Prosecution The Lao government demonstrated progress in its anti- trafficking law enforcement efforts and willingness to collaborate with other countries as well as NGOs and international organizations. Laos prohibits all forms of trafficking through Penal Code Article 134, which prescribes penalties that are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with those prescribed for rape. In 2007, the Ministry of Public Security used Article 134 to investigate 38 cases of trafficking, resulting in 23 arrests and eight ongoing prosecutions. An additional 20 cases are currently under investigation. Police corruption, a weak judicial sector and the population‚Äôs general lack of understanding of the court system impeded anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts. Through legal aid clinics, the Lao Bar Association assisted victims by educating the public at large on the legal system and by providing legal advice to victims of human rights abuses, including human trafficking. Corruption remained a problem with government officials susceptible to involvement or collusion in trafficking in persons, narcotics, wildlife, and illegal logging. No government or law enforcement officials have been disciplined or punished for involvement in trafficking in persons. The Lao government worked with international organizations and civil society to increase law enforcement capacity through training for police, investigators, prosecutors, and customs and border officials. Protection The Lao government demonstrated progress in improving protection for victims of trafficking during the year. The Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare (MLSW) and Immigration Department cooperated with IOM, UNIAP, and a local NGO to provide victim assistance. The MLSW continued operating a small transit center in Vientiane. Victims not wanting to return home are referred to a long-term shelter run by the Lao Women‚Äôs Union or to a local NGO. Over the last year, 280 formally identified victims of cross border trafficking were repatriated to Laos from Thailand and an additional 21 were repatriated in 2008. Approximately 100 victims are currently residing in rehabilitation centers in Thailand. The Lao government provided medical services, counseling, vocational training, and employment services for victims in its transit shelter in Vientiane and at the Lao Women‚Äôs Union shelter. The government actively encouraged victims to participate in investigations and prosecutions of traffickers. As of January 2007, the Lao government stopped requiring exit permits for citizens to travel abroad, which eliminated the potential for penalizing illegal migrants and trafficking victims, through fines, upon their return. Government instructions against fining, and the removal of the legal basis for those fines, effectively reduced financial penalties faced by victims. The government provided land to an NGO for a new shelter and transit center for trafficking victims in Savannakhet in 2007 and it continued to provide office space and staff to assist IOM‚Äôs programs. Prevention The Lao government increased efforts to prevent trafficking in persons with assistance from international organizations and civil society. For example, the MLSW worked with UNICEF to set up awareness-raising billboards near border checkpoints and larger cities. Also, in December 2007, the Lao Youth Union held a day-long event with workshops, puppet shows, and plays to address child trafficking. The event was led by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense who spoke about the dangers of trafficking. The government completed its national action plan to combat trafficking in July 2007. The Government of Laos demonstrated some efforts to reduce demand for commercial sex acts through periodic raids of nightclubs and discos used as fronts for commercial sex. In October and November 2007, police shut down bars and entertainment venues used for commercial sexual activities in Luang Prabang. A general increase in tourism in Laos and a concomitant probable rise in child sex tourism in the region have attracted the attention of Lao authorities who seek to prevent child sex tourism from taking root. Vientiane Province established a task force on child sex tourism in December 2007 to coordinate efforts between the authorities and the tourism sector. The government and NGOs hosted several seminars to train tourism sector employees, including taxi drivers, on how to report suspicious behavior. Tourism police received training on guidelines drafted in July 2007 aimed at combating sex tourism and identifying potential victims. Many major international hotels in Vientiane and Luang Prabang prominently displayed posters created by international NGOs warning about child sex tourism.

U.S. Department of State (June 4, 2008). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. The Government of Latvia does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. The government continued steps to improve victim assistance by increasing access to government funded protections. The government also demonstrated increased efforts to investigate forced labor offenses. It also made modest prevention efforts by taking initial steps to combat sex tourism committed by foreign visitors to Latvia. U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2 Watchlist\\" in 2017. Prosecution The Government of Latvia demonstrated sufficient law enforcement efforts during the reporting period. Latvia prohibits all forms of trafficking through Section 154-1 and 154-2 of its Criminal Code, which prescribes penalties of three to 15 years‚Äô imprisonment. These prescribed penalties are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with penalties prescribed for other grave crimes, such as rape. Latvia also uses non-trafficking-related laws to prosecute traffickers. Police performed 12 trafficking investigations under section 165-1, compared to 22 reported last year, and an additional 14 investigations under other sections‚Äîincluding nine investigations under section 154-1 involving alleged sex trafficking and two investigations involving alleged forced labor. Authorities prosecuted and convicted 21 traffickers under section 165-1, a decrease from 36 reported last year. The government also prosecuted and convicted an additional 15 traffickers under other sections of the law including seven under section 154-1, compared to none in 2006. At least five of the convicted traffickers served time in prison. During the reporting period, two traffickers were sentenced to five to 10 years‚Äô imprisonment, two traffickers were sentenced to three to five years‚Äô imprisonment, and one trafficker was sentenced to one to three years‚Äô imprisonment. At the time of this report, the government was investigating the two cases of potential labor trafficking; however, to date, no one has been prosecuted, convicted, or sentenced for forced labor trafficking. Protection The government made some efforts to improve victim protection. The Ministry of Welfare provided $14,500 for the training of 271 social workers to improve the administration of victim assistance and rehabilitation services. Although the government allocated $98,000 for victim assistance in 2007, it spent only $23,000 ‚Äì an increase from $10,000 spent in 2006. The government offers foreign victims legal alternatives to removal; victims who agree to assist law enforcement may apply for temporary residency and work permits. In 2007, one trafficking victim received a temporary residency permit. Latvia encouraged victims to participate in investigations against their traffickers. In June 2007, the government instituted a 30-day ‚Äúreflection period‚Äù during which non-Latvian victims and their dependent children are eligible for government-funded assistance and rehabilitation services while deciding whether to cooperate with law enforcement. Government authorities and two NGOs may authorize victims to obtain government assistance; during the reporting period, 12 out of 27 identified victims qualified for and received government- funded assistance. The remaining 15 victims received assistance from non-government-funded NGOs. The government continued to provide training to law enforcement officers and specialists in orphan courts to identify victims of trafficking; however, the government referred 13 victims total to NGOs for assistance in 2007. The government did not penalize victims for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of their being trafficked. Prevention Latvia demonstrated modest efforts to prevent trafficking in persons during the reporting period. The Ministry of Family and Children‚Äôs Affairs continued to train professionals in contact with vulnerable populations to advise potential victims of the dangers of trafficking. The Latvian government reported no measures to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts.

Lebanese children are trafficked within the country for the purpose of commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor in the metal works, construction, and agriculture sectors. Women from Sri Lanka, the Philippines, and Ethiopia migrate to Lebanon legally, but often find themselves in conditions of forced labor, through unlawful withholding of passports, non-payment of wages, restrictions on movement, threats, and physical or sexual assault. During the armed conflict in July 2006, Sri Lankan domestic workers reported being restricted from leaving the country by their employers. Eastern European and Syrian women come to Lebanon on \\"artiste\\" visas, but some become victims of trafficking for commercial sexual exploitation when they are subjected to coercive acts such as unlawful withholding of passports, restrictions on movement, threats, and physical assault.\\"Lebanon\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2008. U.S. Department of State (June 4, 2008). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. The Government of Lebanon does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2\\" in 2017. Although it reported 17 prosecutions last year, the government failed to convict or criminally punish anyone for trafficking offenses, despite ample evidence of conditions of forced labor. In addition, the government continued to lack victim protection services or a formal system to ensure that victims are not punished. Prosecution Lebanon did not make significant efforts to prosecute or criminally punish trafficking offenses during the reporting period. Lebanon prohibits forced prostitution through Article 524 of its penal code; prescribed punishment under this statute is imprisonment for at least one year. In addition, commercial sexual exploitation of a person under 21 years old is prohibited by Article 523 of the penal code; the prescribed penalty for violation is imprisonment of one month to one year. The Lebanese Penal Code does not specifically prohibit forced labor, but Article 569's prohibition against deprivation of an individual's liberty to perform a task could be used to prosecute forced labor; the prescribed penalty under this statute is temporary hard labor. The prescribed penalties for acts of sex trafficking are not commensurate with those for other grave crimes, such as rape, and the prescribed penalties for prostitution of children and forced labor are not sufficiently stringent. Due to political constraints, during the reporting period, no legislation could be passed in Lebanon, on trafficking or otherwise. Domestic workers are not protected under Lebanese labor law provisions. Despite the availability of these statutes and laws against physical and sexual assault, the government reported no criminal prosecutions, convictions, or punishments for trafficking offenses; this represents a significant decrease from the 17 prosecutions reported last year. Although police arrested one employer for attempting to murder his domestic worker by beating her severely with a hammer on her back, shoulders, and hands, he was later released without a prison sentence in exchange for giving the worker $6,500; the case is being investigated. Under its administrative laws, the government suspended the licenses of 11 recruitment agencies and closed two for, among other violations, physically abusing workers; nonetheless, no recruitment agent was criminally prosecuted or punished for the abuse. Moreover, despite widespread reports of withholding of passports‚Äîa potential indicator of forced labor‚Äîthe government did not report enforcing laws against this practice. Lebanon similarly did not report any prosecutions, convictions, or punishments for the forced labor or commercial sexual exploitation of children. Despite receiving 31 reports of physical abuse, rape, and withheld wages among adult club employees, these cases were settled out of court, and did not result in any prosecutions or convictions for trafficking offenses. Protection The Government of Lebanon did not make sufficient efforts to protect victims of trafficking during the reporting period. Though government officials received training on victim interview techniques paid for by UNODC and the NGO Caritas, the government does not have a formal procedure to identify victims of trafficking among vulnerable populations, such as foreigners arrested for immigration violations or prostitution. As a result, victims of trafficking were likely punished for acts committed as a result of being trafficked, as foreign workers without valid residency and work permits are subject to arrest, detention, and deportation. Consistent with government regulations, it remains common for employers to force a domestic worker who breaks her contract to repay residency and work permit fees, or pay for a paper releasing her from her contract; there is no exception for workers who break their contracts due to their employers‚Äô abuse. Victims are neither encouraged to participate in trials, nor offered legal alternatives to deportation to countries where they would face hardship or retribution. Rather, victims are often deported home before being given the opportunity to testify against their traffickers. Lebanon does not offer protection services to victims of trafficking; the government, however, referred nine trafficking victims to NGO shelters during the reporting period. Prevention Lebanon made minimal efforts to prevent trafficking in persons. The government partnered with an NGO to produce a public awareness campaign on migrant workers‚Äô rights. In August, the S√ªret√© General and Ministry of Labor met with recruitment agencies to warn them against trafficking workers. The government did not take any steps to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts in Lebanon. The government similarly did not institute a public awareness campaign targeting citizens traveling to known child sex tourism destinations.

The double album is unique in that it was only released in the USA, features original material and American covers over the traditional material usually associated with Fairport, and includes songs from side projects. All of the material was originally issued in the USA on A&M; Records, which explains the exclusion of songs taken from their first, pre- Sandy Denny album, which was only later released in the United States. History A mere two traditional songs are present: \\"Bridge Over The River Ash\\" from 1971's Angel Delight, and \\"Tam Lin\\" from 1969's seminal British folk-rock recording, Liege and Lief. Originals include Richard Thompson's \\"Tale in Hard Time\\", \\"Meet on the Ledge\\", \\"Genesis Hall\\", and \\"Farewell, Farewell\\" (all sung by Sandy Denny); Denny's \\"Who Knows Where The Time Goes\\" (a hit for Judy Collins and later covered by Eva Cassidy), \\"Come All Ye\\" (co- written with bassist Ashley \\"Tyger\\" Hutchings), \\"Listen, Listen\\" (from Denny's album, Sandy), and \\"Fotheringay\\"; \\"Walk Awhile\\", \\"Now Be Thankful\\", and the anti-war statement \\"Sloth\\" by Richard Thompson and fiddle/mandolin player Dave Swarbrick; and the gentle instrumental, \\"End of a Holiday\\", by perhaps the must unsung individual in the band, second guitarist Simon Nicol. Although closely associated with the British folk movement, Fairport, from their formation in 1967, excelled at covering American folk and pop tunes, especially those of Bob Dylan and Joni Mitchell. Although no Mitchell songs made it onto this compilation, Bob Dylan is covered with \\"I'll Keep It With Mine\\", \\"Million Dollar Bash\\", and \\"Percy's Song\\". One of the album's highlights is Fotheringay's interpretation of Gordon Lightfoot's \\"The Way I Feel\\" (Fotheringay was Denny's post-Fairport band). The other two covers ‚Äì Dion DiMucci's \\"My Girl The Month of May\\" and Buddy Holly's \\"Learning The Game\\" ‚Äì are taken from the one-off album Rock On by an aggregation of Fairport members and friends collectively known as The Bunch.

Most victims are trafficked within Liberia, primarily from rural areas to urban areas for domestic servitude, forced street vending, and sexual exploitation. Children are also trafficked to alluvial diamond mining areas for forced labor. Refugees and internally displaced children in Liberia have been subjected to sexual exploitation by some international organization and non-governmental organization (NGO) personnel. A January 2008 United Nations (UN) report indicated that such abuses by UN personnel declined in the previous year. There have been reports that children are trafficked to Liberia from Sierra Leone, Guinea, and C√¥te d'Ivoire and from Liberia to C√¥te d'Ivoire, Guinea, and Nigeria for domestic servitude, street vending, sexual exploitation, and agricultural labor. Struggling to rebuild after 14 years of civil conflict and two years of transitional rule, the capacity of the government elected in 2005 to address trafficking is limited by a crippled judiciary and a lack of resources. Aside from capacity issues, in the wake of its war, Liberia has not been sufficiently aggressive in prosecuting traffickers or providing care to victims.\\"Liberia\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2008. U.S. Department of State (June 4, 2008). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. The U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2 Watchlist\\" in 2017. The Government of Liberia does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking. However, it is making significant efforts to do so, despite limited resources. Great improvements are needed in the areas of law enforcement and victim protection. At the same time, the government undertook commendable efforts in the area of prevention. Prosecution The Government of Liberia demonstrated limited law enforcement efforts to combat trafficking in 2008. Liberia's 2005 Act to Ban Trafficking prohibits all forms of trafficking. No traffickers have been convicted or sentenced under this law. The law prescribes a minimum penalty of one year imprisonment for labor trafficking of adults, six years' imprisonment for sex trafficking of adults, five to 11 years' imprisonment for child labor trafficking, and 11 to 16 years' imprisonment for child sex trafficking. These penalties are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with penalties prescribed for rape. The government investigated seven trafficking cases in 2008, six of which were cases of trafficking within the country and one of which involved transnational trafficking. Three suspects remain in police custody pending trial, three were released on bail after their charges were reduced, and one suspect was deported. All newly recruited police officers continued to participate in UN-sponsored trainings on trafficking. Due to a shortage of funds, police continue to lack basic investigatory tools, such as vehicles, and rely heavily on UN assistance. The Women and Children Protection Section (WCPS) of the Liberia National Police collaborated with the UN to address sexual exploitation and abuse of minors by expatriate humanitarian workers in Liberia as well as by Liberian nationals. Protection Liberia demonstrated minimal efforts to protect trafficking victims during 2008. Due to lack of resources, the government does not directly provide shelter or other services to victims. The Liberian government refers victims to NGOs with the capacity to provide victim care. The WCPS referred victims to an international NGO and was available to provide security for victims. The government was unable to provide statistics on the number of children assisted. The government does not encourage victims, all of whom are children, to assist in trafficking investigations or prosecutions. Liberia does not provide legal alternatives to the removal of foreign victims to countries where they face hardship or retribution. Victims are not inappropriately incarcerated, fined or otherwise penalized for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked. Prevention The Government of Liberia made significant efforts to educate the public about trafficking. The Ministry of Labor's Commission on Child Labor launched a campaign to alert parents and children about the dangers of child labor on rubber plantations. The National Human Trafficking Task Force aired anti-trafficking radio spots funded by the Liberian government. Since November 2007, the Task Force has also worked closely with a local NGO on anti-trafficking public education programs by providing legal guidance. In October 2007, the Task Force held a government- funded workshop to sensitize local government officials about trafficking. The Task Force, which is chaired by the Minister of Labor, but which lacks a budget, held a meeting every two months in 2007. The government's Commission on Child Labor, which was reestablished in 2005, continued to meet quarterly during the year. The government has taken steps to reduce demand for commercial sex acts through its awareness campaign against sexual exploitation and abuse.

As in previous years, there were isolated reports that women from sub-Saharan Africa were trafficked to Libya for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation. Although precise figures are unavailable, foreign observers estimate that approximately one to two percent of Libya's 1.5 to 2 million foreigners may be victims of trafficking.\\"Libya\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2008. U.S. Department of State (June 4, 2008). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. The Government of Libya does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking, but is making significant efforts to do so. Libya is placed on Tier 2 Watch List for its failure to provide evidence of increasing efforts to address trafficking in persons over the previous year, particularly in the area of investigating and prosecuting trafficking offenses. During the year, Libya provided in-kind assistance to training programs designed to educate law enforcement and civil society groups about trafficking. The government also appointed a national anti-trafficking coordinator responsible for Libya's efforts to protect trafficking victims and punish trafficking offenders. As in previous years, however, Libya did not publicly release any data on investigations or punishment of any trafficking offenses. Proofs In 2016, the photojournalist Narciso Contreras, with the help of the Carmignac Photojournalism Award, brought back pictures of migrants in detention centres in Libya. Prosecution The Government of Libya provided no public information on its law enforcement efforts to punish trafficking in persons during the reporting period. Libya's laws do not prohibit trafficking for commercial sexual exploitation or forced labor. The government failed to provide data on any criminal investigations, prosecutions, convictions or sentences for trafficking offenses this year, although senior officials noted during the year that Libya prosecuted individuals for confiscating foreign workers' passports until the workers had repaid an alleged and sizeable smuggling 'debt.' Widespread corruption in the country may facilitate trafficking, but the government did not report prosecuting, convicting, or sentencing any official for complicity. In addition, Libya provided in-kind assistance for IOM training of law enforcement officials, including border security and customs, on trafficking. Protection Libya took minimal steps to improve protection of victims of trafficking this year. The government did not provide protection services such as psychological or legal assistance to victims of trafficking. Libya provided in-kind support to a program that trained over 80 law enforcement officers and civil society activists to medically assist trafficking victims. Recognizing that many government officials still fail to distinguish between trafficking victims in need of protective services and other migrants, the government permitted international organizations access to vulnerable Eritreans, Ethiopians, Somalis, Sudanese, and Iraqis to screen for evidence of trafficking. While trafficking victims remained susceptible to punishment for unlawful acts, such as immigration violations and prostitution, committed as a result of being trafficked, during the reporting period, there were no reports that trafficking victims were deported. The government does not actively encourage victims to participate in investigations and prosecutions against their traffickers. Prevention During the reporting period, Libya took no discernible action to prevent trafficking in persons. The government did not conduct any public awareness campaigns to highlight the issue of trafficking in persons. Libya also did not take any measures to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts. Similarly, Libya did not undertake any public awareness campaigns targeting citizens traveling to known child sex tourism destinations abroad.

Michael Burghers (b. c.1647/8 ‚Äì 1727) was a Dutch illustrator and artist of the 17th century, who spent most of his career in England. He was commissioned to create maps, estate plans, and illustrations of stately houses, by the English aristocracy. Descent into Hell, published in his own Ancient Mysteries Described. Biography Michael Burghers was a Dutch engraver, who settled in England on the taking of Utrecht by Louis XIV. He lived mostly at Oxford, and on several of his plates he added Academiae Oxon. calcographus after his name. He was the author of a book, Ancient Mysteries Described, which was reprinted into the early 19th century. Describing Burghers' style, Joseph Strutt wrote > He worked almost wholly with the graver, in a stiff, tasteless style, > without genius, or knowledge of the art of design. His drawing, when he > attempted to draw the naked figure is wholly defective. He has, though, > painfully preserved many ancient reliques, the originals of which are now > lost. Strutt thought that Burghers' best plates were his copies after Claude Mellan, and his topographical work, much of it for the antiquary Thomas Hearne. He died on 10 January 1726-7. Works From 1676 Burghers engraved the plates for the Almanacks of the University. His most esteemed prints are his antiquities, ruins of abbeys, and other curiosities. He also engraved several portraits and plates for the classics.

During the last year, Lithuania sustained generous anti-trafficking funding by allocating more than $144,000 to Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to help improve victim assistance and prevention efforts. The government also ensured that all convicted traffickers received prison sentences, a notable improvement from the previous reporting period. U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 1\\" in 2017. Prosecution The Government of Lithuania demonstrated mixed law enforcement efforts during the reporting period; although the number of investigations, prosecutions, and convictions decreased, the government ensured that all convicted traffickers served some time in prison. Lithuania prohibits all forms of trafficking through Article 147 of its criminal code, which prescribes penalties ranging from probation to 15 years‚Äô imprisonment. These penalties are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with penalties prescribed for other grave crimes, such as rape. In 2007, authorities initiated nine trafficking investigations, down from 26 investigations is 2006. Authorities prosecuted eight defendants during the reporting period, a significant decrease from 23 defendants prosecuted in 2006. Lithuanian courts convicted four trafficking offenders in 2007, a significant decrease from 10 convictions in 2006; however, all convicted traffickers received prison sentences ‚Äîan improvement over 2006, when 20 percent of convicted traffickers served no time in prison. Sentences ranged from five to eight years‚Äô imprisonment. Officials also acknowledge that many law enforcement officers lack experience in investigating trafficking cases and managing pre-trial investigations. Although Lithuania has bilateral cooperation agreements on combating trafficking with more than 20 countries, some NGOs claimed that officials lack the capacity to effectively obtain evidence from foreign law enforcement institutions; however, Lithuanian authorities‚Äô cooperation with police in the United Kingdom led to the successful convictions of Lithuanian traffickers. In May 2007, each of Lithuania‚Äôs 10 counties appointed one police officer to coordinate anti- trafficking activities. Protection The Lithuanian government continued to improve efforts to protect and assist victims of trafficking. NGOs identified 56 trafficking victims in 2007, compared with 110 in 2006. In 2007, the government provided approximately $144,000 to 13 anti-trafficking NGOs to conduct victim assistance and rehabilitation, including vocational training and job placement for victims. With funding from the government, IOM developed a method for victim identification and a national victim referral mechanism; it was formally adopted by police in December 2007. The government encouraged victims to assist in trafficking investigations and prosecutions, though many trafficking victims are reluctant to initiate cases. In 2007, the government allocated $100,000 to improve witness protection services, including for victims of trafficking. Victims who participated in court proceedings were eligible for temporary residency permits. Identified victims were not penalized for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of their being trafficked. Prevention Lithuania showed significant progress in its trafficking prevention efforts. In March 2007, the government appointed a high-ranking official at the Ministry of Interior to coordinate government- wide anti-trafficking activities. In 2007, the government held five anti- trafficking coordination meetings with NGOs, although NGOs reported there was uneven cooperation between NGOs and police, especially in rural areas. The government allocated approximately $15,000 to NGOs for anti-trafficking prevention, including a campaign to reduce the demand for commercial sexual exploitation. The campaign included broadcasting of audio and video spots on radio and TV as well as posters at bus and train stations. The posters had the slogans: ‚ÄúIt is a shame to buy women‚Äù and ‚ÄúWould you buy me?‚Äù These posters were displayed in approximately 2000 locations in 13 towns throughout the country. The government spent an additional $30,000 for an anti-trafficking awareness campaign for youth in six cities during 2007.

Traf yupficking in Persons Report 2008. U.S. Department of State (June 4, 2008). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. The Government of Luxembourg fully complies with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking. The government improved its law enforcement efforts by sentencing and convicting more traffickers during the reporting period and took steps to address child sex tourism. U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 1\\" in 2017. Prosecution In 2007, the government demonstrated strong law enforcement efforts to combat trafficking. During the reporting period, it convicted and sentenced six human traffickers on charges of procuring prostitution, human trafficking, and smuggling. Sentences ranged from one to three years‚Äô imprisonment and included fines. Article 379 of the penal code specifically criminalizes trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation, but does not explicitly address trafficking for purposes of forced labor. Forced labor is nonetheless criminalized in Luxembourg via its 1996 ratification of the European Social Charter. Penalties prescribed by Article 379 are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with penalties for rape. The government continued its ongoing training aimed at police, immigration, and other government officials and non- governmental organizations (NGOs) on victim identification. There was no evidence of trafficking complicity by Luxembourg public officials. Protection The Government of Luxembourg continued to offer adequate protection to identified trafficking victims in 2007. The government encourages victims to participate in a criminal investigation and, through its funding of two domestic NGOs, provides shelter, protection, and assistance to victims. The government‚Äôs specialized police anti-trafficking unit reported that Luxembourg‚Äôs legal commercial sex trade was a likely catalyst for trafficking and closely monitored the prostitution sector for evidence of trafficking. A 2007 report issued by the government estimated there were up to 500 women in prostitution in Luxembourg. While victims are not punished for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of their being trafficked, women in prostitution who are in the country illegally are often deported or imprisoned, and the government did not provide evidence that it systematically checked these women for trafficking indicators. The government did not establish a network to coordinate care for victims of trafficking, planned in 2006. Prevention In 2007, the Ministry of Equal Opportunity conducted various symposia to publicize the negative effects of the commercial sex trade; however, it did not conduct any specific anti-trafficking awareness campaigns to prevent trafficking within the legal sex industry in Luxembourg during the reporting period. In 2007, the government co-funded and launched a campaign with ECPAT to prevent its nationals from engaging in child sex tourism abroad. The campaign created a special e-mail address to receive tips and disseminated posters and leaflets through travel agencies, at the national airport, at hospitals, and in municipal buildings. Luxembourg has ratified the 2000 UN TIP Protocol on 20 April 2009.

History of CIB  Cardiff Institute for the Blind was founded in April 1865 by Frances Batty Shand, the daughter of a Jamaican plantation owner. After moving to Cardiff, Shand set up a small workshop employing five blind men to make baskets for coal ships. After employing ten more men, the workshop was relocated to Byron Street in Roath, later moving to Longcross Road - near the Institute's former home on Newport Road. By 1900, around 100 blind men and women were employed making baskets, brushes and mats. The Longcross Street building was destroyed during World War II. A plot of land situated on Newport Road was donated to the charity in 1949 - and made way for Shand House completed and opened in 1953. The Institute celebrated their 140th birthday in 2005 with a march through Queen Street, followed by a party. By this date the CIB was helping 7,500 people with visual impairments, funded by ¬£350,000 raised by the charity. The Institute remained at Shand House until October 2012, when they moved to a temporary accommodation in Bridge Street until their new headquarters in Womanby Street, Cardiff, was completed. They share the new offices with the Royal National Institute for the Blind (RNIB).  Services  CIB offers support and services for visually impaired people in Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan.

Flads and gloe lakes are different stages in the process where a bay in the sea turns into a freshwater lake due to post-glacial rebound. Location Flads and gloe lakes exist in the Baltic Sea in Finland and Sweden. These types of brackish lagoon are typical of the flat land of the Finnish part of the Kvarken Archipelago. The island of Hals√∂n, Korsn√§s, in the Kvarken Archipelago of Finland includes a protected nature reserve covering an important area of flads and gloe lakes.* Development process The process can be divided into four stages, and starts with a bay with some kind of threshold sill or band of vegetation that slows the influx of water from the sea. As the land rises the threshold becomes shallower and the inflow of sea water slower. In the stage called a flad, the bay is still in continuous contact with the sea, but the influx of sea water is very slow and the impact of fresh water becomes more important. Often reeds and other water plants make the influx of sea water even slower. In its natural state a flad functions as a refugium for species of the order Charales that are seemingly endangered in more open waters. At this stage human beings often interfere by dredging the threshold or cutting down reeds to prevent the bay from becoming a flad. When the flad has definitely been cut off from the sea, i.e. the threshold has risen above sea level, a gloe has been formed. Sea water still enters the gloe at high tide or when storms create big enough waves. The vegetation gets scarcer in the gloe at this stage. Finally a gloe lake has been formed when the gloe no longer has any contact with the sea and doesn't get any influx of sea water. The gloe has turned into a freshwater lake.

He was closely associated with Connaught royalty, and had served as abbot of Tuam. Biography Ua hOiss√≠n was the first Archbishop of Tuam and one of four bishops granted pallia at the Synod of Kells by the papal legate Cardinal Archbishop Giovanni Paparoni in 1152. He played a part in the period of Cistercian-inspired church reform initiated by St Malachy immediately before the Norman invasion of Ireland. He came from a family with some church connections: Aed Ua Oisin was also the name of a coarb of Iarlaith of Tuam (abbot of Jarlath's Monastery) in the late 11th century ‚Äì this abbot is said to have died in 1085.Unknown. Annals of Clonmacnoise With other clergy he actively intervened in the affairs of Connaught and Ireland more broadly, and though Connaught wasn't a centre of Cistercian inspired reform he was part of a renewal of the Church centred on the refoundation of Tuam by Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair in 1128. He was both preceded and succeeded as chief Bishop of Connacht by members of the prominent ecclesiastical family of √ì Dubhthaigh. O hOisins or Hession's still live in and around Tuam today. Politics Ua Oisin was closely connected with kings Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair and Ruaidr√≠ Ua Conchobair, Kings of Connaught and High Kings of Ireland. He is associated, as Abbot of Tuam (and therefore prior to his accession), with a spectacular High Cross in Tuam, which honours King Toirdelbach.For Association of the Turlough, Hugh and the High Cross see Petrie, Hourihane and Edwards The High Cross is inscribed with the messageHe is probably one of the few 12th century Irishmen whose image survives on a monument.The High Cross in Tuam (as seen in this picture from the Galway Public Library) was reassembled by George Petrie in the 1820s with the help of one Martin Hession, a resident of the town of Tuam. See Petrie Abbot of Tuam/Coarb of Iarlaith It's unclear when √Åed first became Abbot of Tuam, but it's clear his predecessor Muirgius ua Nioc, superior of Tuaim d√° Gualann, died in Inis in Ghaill (Inchagoill) on Loch Corrib in 1128. √Åed had probably succeeded by that time and is therefore probably the successor of St Jarlath who took part in the refoundation of Tuam with Toirdhealbhach √ì Conchobhair the same year, and referred to in the Annals of TighernachAnnals of Tighernach In 1134 as Abbot of Tuam, the Annals of Innisfallen and Annals of Tighernach record that he was sent by Toirdelbach with Muireadhach Ua Dubhthaigh then Bishop to make peace with Munster following a raid on Tuam by the O'Briens and their allies.. As part of these negotiations the Abbey of St Finbarr of Cork was re-established with a church for Connaught Pilgrims, and Gilla √Åedha Ua Maig√≠n as Abbot. St Finbarr himself was the son of Amergin of Maigh Se√≥la near Tuam, and according to Mac Carthaigh's Book, Gilla Aedha (named for Aedh Ua Oisin), who was also present at the Synod of Kells, died in 1173. In 1135, according to the Annals of the Four Masters, he became a guarantor for Toirdhealbhach's son Ruaidr√≠ Ua Conchobair (the last High King of Ireland), who Toirdhealbhach had taken hostage. In 1143 Ua Oisin was again a guarantor with Ua Dubthaig of Ruaidr√≠ Ua Conchobair, and protested his arrest at a Synod of 12 Bishops and 500 priests, though Ruaidri was only released in 1144. This same year he also took part in a peace conference between Ua Conchobair and Ua Brian at Tir da Ghlas.Annals of the Four Masters Archbishop of Tuam During the first half of the 12th century, the post of Archbishop/Bishop of Connacht had being held by Ua hOissin's predecessors ‚Äì Cathasach Ua Conaill (died 1117), Domhnall Ua Dubhthaigh (1117-1136), Muireadhach Ua Dubhthaigh (1136-1150). His investiture as Archbishop in 1152 was the culmination of a long negotiation by St Malachy of Armagh to secure reform of the Irish Church and settle the appointment of metropolitans by the pope, Eugenius III. St Malachy died in 1148 on his mission to secure the palia ‚Äì in the arms of St Bernard of Clairvaux.The pallia was a symbol of office. The initial plan was apparently to secure two palia for Armagh and Cashel, but the claims of Toirdelbach, and Dublin's link to Canterbury meant ultimately Tuam and Dublin were conceded metropolitan status. See Pallium. Initially, the papal legate Giovanni Paparoni was refused passage to Ireland by King Stephen of England in 1150, probably to protect Canterbury's traditional claim over Dublin. But he returned in 1151, with Christian Ua Conairce, a Cistercian colleague of the Pope, who became the first Abbot of Mellifont, Bishop of Lismore, and the next papal legate. He was given safe passage by King David I of Scotland and spent some months in Ireland, at Armagh and elsewhere confirming the settlement before convening the Synod of Kells at Kells and subsequently near Drogheda at Mellifont. Aubrey Gwynn concludes that Ua Oisin was not a Bishop immediately prior to his investiture as the first Archbishop of Tuam and of Connacht. As a result, he is not named but was rather one of the five candidate bishops mentioned at Kells, and received his pallium as Archbishop later at Mellifont on Palm Sunday. In 1156, and after King Toirdelbach's death, he was prevented from joining a Synod called by the Ua Mael Sechlainn Kings of Mide by representatives of the king. At this Synod the successor of Colum-Cille head of the Columban Churches, Flaithbheartach Ua Brolchain, was given episcopal status. A Synod of Connaught for clergy was held in Roscommon instead. According to the Annals of Ulster these were agents of Ua Mael Sechlainn. But, also according to the Annals of Ulster, he returned to Mellifont where he received his Pall for its consecration in 1157. Death Hession died in 1161 and was succeeded by Cadla Ua Dubthaig. Hession was considered sufficiently deserving to be buried in a magnificent marble tomb that survived until the mid-16th century.Lannigan, Ecclesiastical History of Ireland, 1827 A new street has recently been named in his honour in Tuam.

It remains the only manor house in the Parish of Barlow, and the current house dates from the early 17th century, although there are much earlier origins to before 1269.  History  Barlow Woodseats Hall Manorial tenure began with Ascoit Musard in 1086 and ownership passed through members of several families including the Earl of Shrewsbury from 1593. The present hall dates from the 17th century but there has been a house here from at least 1269 when it was called Barlew Woodsets meaning ‚Äòa house in the wood belonging to Barley‚Äô. The deeds dated June 1368 and later dates refer to Barley Wodesetes. It is also believed to be once occupied by one of Derbyshire‚Äôs best-known daughters Bess of Hardwick who married the owner of the Hall; he subsequently died in 1544. This was the first of her four husbands even though she was only 14. The main house was built by local yeoman Arthur Mower, and it is believed this was around the time he married in 1620. Arthur Mower was appointed Agent to George Barley, Lord of the Manor in Barlow in 1563, then on George's death in 1568 to his son Peter Barley. Mower died in 1652 but several generations of his family occupied the house in subsequent years. The manor of Barlow was held, with Staveley, by the Musards; it was afterwards in the ancient family of Abitot, a branch of which, on settling here, is supposed to have taken their name from the place. The family of Barlow, or Barley, possessed it for several generations. James Barley, Esq., sold it in 1593, to George Earl of Shrewsbury; the Earl of Newcastle purchased it from the Shrewsbury family in the reign of James I or Charles I. Having passed by descent to the Duke of Portland, it was in 1813 exchanged with the Duke of Rutland for the manor of Whitwell. In 1843 the house passed to the Thorold family by the marriage of Charlotte Mower. This family can be traced back 900 years to the Sheriff of Lincoln who lived during the reign of Edward the Confessor. Until 2006 the house had been owned for many years by the Milward family, owners of Milward's Needles. With the death of Rosemary Milward (n√©e Smedley-Aston), a well-respected local medieval historian and wife of Chesterfield surgeon F. John Milward, the house was put on the open market and sold in 2006.  Property description  The house is separate from its ancient cruck barn and farmland. The medieval cruck barn stands to the west side of the farmland, and is believed to be the longest continuous roofed barn in Derbyshire of this age. Damage was caused to the building by a land mine in April 1941. The comprehensive restoration was carried out to the east wall, and a sheet of paper was discovered behind a wall plate, which was thought to have been left there when the house was built in 1624. The property is built over four storeys, featuring several separate cellars, ground floor, first floor and extensive attics in the roof. The house, which has eight bedrooms, still retains the very wide fireplaces in both the kitchen (stretching across most of one wall) and the drawing room. The property is of thinly bedded coursed measured sandstone with ashlar dressings, coped gables, quoins, gable and end ashlar ridge stacks with moulded caps and a stone slated roof. To the north elevation there is a central gabled range with tall chamfer mullioned window set centrally at each floor level beneath a drip mould; the ground floor with four window lights, the second floor with three window lights and the attic floor with two. The west gable now incorporates a porch internally which appears to be a 17th-century addition. The ground floor rooms retain good 17th-century hearths especially the pleasant kitchen with its wide segmental ashlar arch. The dining room retains chamfered and quoined surrounds to the hearths and has 17th-century square oak panelling. The staircase with masonry centre wall and oak stairs has a massive oak door at the half landing which is secured from the flight above. At the attic floor level, there are four exposed roof trusses, three of which are braced with collar beams and longitudinal braces. The house features a garage/coachhouse attached to the main structure, which shows signs of having been a two-storey arrangement at some point in the past. Within the present garage is a single upper cruck truss.NORTH EAST DERBYSHIRE COUNCIL's ARCHIVE DEPARTMENT  References  Category:Houses completed in 1620 Category:Country houses in Derbyshire Category:Grade II* listed buildings in Derbyshire Category:Grade II* listed houses Category:North East Derbyshire District Category:1620 establishments in England ","title":"Barlow Woodseats Hall"},{"id":"21672357","title":"Hardships!"},{"id":"21672362","text":"Dorothy Louise Anderson circa 1911 at age 18.

The name of Shahmaran comes from Persian words \\"Shah\\" and \\"Maran\\". \\"Shah\\" is a title used for Persian kings, \\"mar\\" means snake, but in plural \\"mar-an\\" means snakes. Mythology Shahmaran is a mythical creature, half woman and half snake, the first human she encounters is a young man named Camasb (also known as Yada Jamsab, Jamisav in other versions of the story). Camasb gets stuck in a cave after he tries to steal honey with a few friends, his friends leave him alone in the cave. He decides to explore the cave and finds a passage to a chamber that looks like a mystical and beautiful garden with thousands of off-white colored snakes and the Shahmaran living together harmoniously. At this point Shahmaran and Camasb fall in love and live in the cave chamber, and the Shahmaran teaches him about medicines and medicinal herbs. Camasb misses living above ground and wants to leave, he tells the Shahmaran he will not share the secret of her living there. Many years pass. The king of the town of Tarsus becomes ill and the vizier discovers the treatment of his condition requires the Shahmaran flesh. Camasb tells the towns people where Shahmaran lives, according to the legend Shahmaran says, ‚Äúblanch me in an earthen dish, give my extract to the vizier, and feed my flesh to the sultan.‚Äù They bring her to the town and kill her in a bath called, \\"≈ûahmaran Hamam\\". The king eats her flesh and lives, the vizier drinks the extract and dies. Camasb drinks the water of Shahmaran and becomes a doctor, by gaining the Shahmaran's wisdom. Since it is an old story, there are many variations of the same story. Popular culture In Turkey, Shahmaran is believed to live in the Mediterranean town of Tarsus and a similar legend is told in the Mardin region. In this region her legend is commonly evoked, with her image still depicted in embroidery, fabrics, and jewelry. The story and imagery of Shahmaran are considered a national treasure in Turkey. Many of the versions of the story of Shahmaran are found in fictional books including the J.C. Mardrus translation of Arabian Night Tales as the story of \\"Jemlia - the Sultan of Underground\\" and The Ring of Shah Maran, A Story from the Mountains of Turkey. The 1944 fairy tale book called The Ring of Shah Maran, A Story from the Mountains of Kurdistan by Raphael Emmanuel tells the folk story of a boy that shares bread with animals and earns the respect of Shahmaran. Dutch singer of Iranian descent, Sevdaliza, included a song titled \\"Shahmaran\\" on her debut studio album ISON. In 2020, the Mardin Metropolitan Municipality in Turkey hosted a public art exhibition, Shahmaran Mardin, featuring Shahmaran statues artist by Ayla Turan, that were decorated by local artists and businesses.
