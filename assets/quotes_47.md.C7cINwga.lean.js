The feats he has performed include paddling a paper boat down 257.5 km of the River Thames, rowing a bathtub across the English Channel, and inflating the world's largest man-inflated balloon. Career FitzHigham began telling funny stories in a rum shop in the West Indies while working as a pig and nutmeg farmer; this may have been the beginnings of his work as a stand-up comedian. Back in the UK in 1999, he performed at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe with James Cary and Jonny Saunders in \\"Infinite Number of Monkeys ‚Äì Sketch Comedy of Hypotheticals\\", where he was nominated for the Perrier Comedy Award (now the Edinburgh Comedy Award) for best newcomer. In 2000 he established Infinite Number of Monkeys as a production company and in the same year won a Spirit of the Fringe Award. His live shows, with topics ranging from the Karma Sutra to Morris Dancing, have been made Critic's Choice in various newspapers, including The Times, The Sunday Times, The Daily Telegraph, The Independent, The Guardian, The Observer, The Scotsman, Scotland on Sunday, The Evening Standard, Time Out and Metro. From around 2005 Tim and Andrew Maxwell hosted a late night comedy show at the comedy store and also Edinburgh Festival. It was described by Maxwell as a 'late night howling cult' and by Tim as a 'late night Hammer Horror Hip Hop Muppet Show'. It was initially called Maxwell's Fullmooners then simply Fullmooners. It featured break dancers, a chanteuse and comedians such as Simon Pegg, Jimmy Carr, Dara O'Briain, Ed Byrne, Jason Bryne, Jim Jeffries. It has often been quoted as the late night show by which others have been rated. The last publicly recorded Fullmooners was to a sold out McEwan Hall in Edinburgh. The solo shows he has performed include Don Quixote, in which he attempted to live like a medieval knight errant in celebration of the 400th anniversary of the publication of the novel Don Quixote. As a guest on BBC Radio 4's The Museum of Curiosity, he donated the novel Don Quixote to the museum. Eventually it was decided that Don Quixote would be better suited as the security guard on the museum steps where he could do less damage. In 2011, he was nominated for the Malcolm Hardee Cunning Stunt Award at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. for his live show The Gambler The Guardian's Brian Logan wrote, \\"his unflappable pluck in the face of impossible (or at least ridiculous) odds seldom fails to amuse\\". In 2012, he was nominated for the Malcolm Hardee Act Most Likely to Make a Million Quid Award at the Edinburgh Fringe.http://www.malcolmhardee.co.uk/award He lost to the now millionaire Trevor Noah. In 2013 he presented CBBC science show Super Human Challenge. In which he ran across Death Valley, pulled a Double Decker Bus and tried arrow catching. During this Tim recorded the highest measured resting tolerance to G-force. His live show about historical Gambling became BBC Radio 4 series called Tim FitzHigham: The Gambler. The 2013 pilot episode involved a bet from 1753 and his nemesis Alex Horne. Since then, two four-part series of The Gambler have been made for BBC Radio 4 (first broadcast in 2014 and 2015), with repeats on Radio 4 Extra. Alex Horne and Tim have a long-standing wager concerning who can live the longest of the two of them, Tim is currently winning by two years. After drinking a pint of claret, Tim came joint-first in the initial live version of Horne brainchild Taskmaster losing to Mike Wozniak in a hastily added nod-off. Perhaps due to this neither Mike or Tim have appeared in the TV version of the show.https://dave.uktv.co.uk/shows/taskmaster/ However, backstage after the live show, Tim won a side bet with Horne that he would place in the top three. In 2017 the new comedy project Tim mentored for BBC Radio Norfolk began broadcasting on BBC Radio Suffolk and in November won support from the Director General Tony Hall, Baron Hall of Birkenheadhttp://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2017/11/09/38369/bbc_boss%3A_local_radio_should_nurture_new_comedy_talent Tim has been appointed to mentor a similar project for BBC Essex. Since 2018 Tim has been involved in the project to keep the UK's oldest working theatre open and running. It is called the Guildhall of St George in King's Lynn and has a first recorded performance in 1445. He is a founding trustee of Shakespeare's Guildhall Trust (King's Lynn). Feats FitzHigham holds several world records and has achieved many unusual feats. The first was achieved in 2003, when he paddled a paper boat down 160 miles of the River Thames in order to raise money for Comic Relief. Having set out with an initial goal of raising ¬£500, the international attention the stunt received resulted in thousands of pounds in donationsTim FitzHigham on Digging Those Odds: Exclusive Interview, Casino.org 07 May 2016. His boat Lillibet is now in the collection of the National Maritime Museum Cornwall. The record had stood for 383 years, having been set in 1619 by John Taylor, a Jacobean poet and Queen's Waterman. His second such feat was being the first person to row a bathtub across the English Channel. His first attempt was in 2004 for Sport Relief, when he tried to row from France to Tower Bridge, London in a bathtub made by Thomas Crapper and Co. Ltd, named \\"Lilibet II\\", after the childhood nickname of Queen Elizabeth II. However, a storm on 14 July consisting of Force 6 winds resulted in the attempt failing and bathtub being damaged. In 2005, FitzHigham made a second attempt, this time for Comic Relief, and successfully crossed. He later wrote about the experience in his first book, In The Bath, later retitled All at Sea, and the story was turned into a show that was performed at the Fringe. In honour of the event, Thomas Crapper and Co. Ltd made a special lavatory named after him. It is only the second commemorative lavatory in history, the other being made for Queen Victoria's jubilee. In June 2006, FitzHigham, along with impressionist Alistair McGowan, the UK Environment Agency and the United Nations set new British and European records assembling the longest washing line in the country in Trafalgar Square, London. It was done in order to raise awareness environmental issues and UN World Environment Day. In November 2006, FitzHigham inflated the world's largest man-inflated balloon to raise awareness of environmental issues, which held 19,000 pints of air. During the attempt he fainted twice within two hours. Other Media Tim appears with a paper boat in Time Team, two series of Zapped (TV series) and as King Arthur in The Windsors. He also appeared as a potter in a long running advert for Purplebricks In film, he appeared in Paddington 2 as the magician and grandfather of Hugh Grant's character, and as a drunk actor in the DVD cut of The Wolfman, alongside Benicio del Toro. He played himself in the cinema release of Hereafter starring Matt Damon and directed by Clint Eastwood. His book All at Sea is also featured in the film. He also starred in Morgan Flynn ‚Äì a short by Academy Award-nominated director Tanel Toom. Titles Other than his records, FitzHigham has been kindly recognised in various ways. These include being a Freeman of the City of London, Freeman of the Company of Watermen and Lightermen of the River Thames, Fellow of the Royal Society of Art, Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, the Commodore of Sudbury Quay, Pittancer of Selby and Most Puissant Knight de Santa Maria.

Early life He was born in born in the Polish city of Makarov, Kiev province, now in Ukraine. His father was a religiously observant Jew and he himself was brought up in a traditional way: he studied in a \\"Heder\\" (Jewish elementary school) and in a \\"Yeshiva\\" (Jewish high school). He always found himself attracted to art. After his father‚Äôs sudden death he moved to Kiev to study sculpture. Education and career Dobrinsky lived in Kiev for six years. He began sculpting terracotta figures, and enrolled in Sabatovski art school.Ben Uri Art Gallery website He worked as a storekeeper in a tin can factory during this period. In 1912, he won a prize for his sculpture which allowed him to move to Paris where he lived until his death in 1973.Silver & Golan, p. 99. Upon his arrival in France, he became friends with the sculptor Marec Szwarc and the painter Chaim Soutine who helped him settle down in Paris and shared their studio with him. Dobrinsky abandoned sculpture in favor of painting a year after his arrival, as a result of ill health. His first painting was shown at the Salon d'Automne a few months later. In 1914, he joined the French Foreign Legion, but he was soon released on medical discharge. He then returned to Paris and attended the Colarossi Academy, where he met Vera Kremer (her father, Arkadi Kremer, was the founder of the Bund, the Jewish socialist party in Eastern Europe). The two got married in 1926. In 1934, he moved to a larger studio in Montparnasse, and in the next few years he made his major breakthrough in the art scene. These were happy days for the young couple, full of creativity. But Second World War put an end to this harmony. In the first two years of the German occupation, Dobrinsky and his family stayed in Paris, but in 1942, in order to escape deportation, they fled to a small village Dordogne. In 1944, after the liberation, Dobrinsky returned to Paris to find that the sculptures he had left behind were destroyed. In 1950, he was invited by Serge and Rachel Pludermacher (the founders of an orphan home) to paint the portraits of the children in their institute. In the course of two years, Dobrinsky worked on about forty portraits of young boys and girls. Dobrinsky used to say: \\"I don‚Äôt wish to be successful, I just wish to understand the mystery of creation\\". Those who knew Dobrinsky say that there was something almost religious in his act of painting: very intimate and somewhat melancholic. Even though he had a heart condition during his last years, he had never stopped painting, and always in the same manner. When he died at the age of 81, he was working on a still life painting. Today he is remembered for his paintings rather than his sculptures.Isaac Dobrinsky in the RKD Notes References * Puech, Christian. (2008).

Gondwana assembly The notion that Gondwana was assembled during the Late Precambrian from two older fragments along the Pan-African Mozambique Belt was first proposed in the early 1980s. A decade later this continental collision was named the East African Orogeny, but it was also realised that this was not the simple bringing together of two halves. Rather, it was the piecemeal assembly of several much smaller cratonic elements that once formed an earlier supercontinent (today known as Rodinia), a process that eventually culminated in the relatively short-lived Gondwanan supercontinent. Two partly incomparable scenarios have been proposed for this assembly.For a discussion see ; ; ; In one model, the EAO evolved from an accretionary orogeny involving the amalgamation of arcs and evolved into a collisional orogeny when the Neoproterozoic continent Azania collided with the Congo-Tanzania-Bangweulu Block at .Azania was defined by and named by In another model, the assembly of East Gondwana was a multiphase process which included two main periods of orogenesis: the older EAO ( ) and the younger Kuunga Orogeny ( ). In the former scenario the Kuunga Orogeny of the latter scenario are two coeval events: the collisions between India and Australia-East Antarctica and Azania and India. Furthermore, the two orogens of the latter scenario intersect in Madagascar, the proposed location of the Azania-India collision, and this part of the Kuunga Orogeny should be renamed the Malagasy Orogeny. Erosion and Cambrian explosion The East African orogeny resulted in the formation of an enormous mountain chain, known as the Transgondwanan Supermountain, which was more than -long and -wide. The sedimentary deposition from this mountain chain, known as the Gondwana Super-fan, exceeded or the equivalent to covering the United States with of sediment, lasted for 260 million years and coincided with the Cambrian explosion, the sudden radiation of animal (Metazoan) life . These unprecedented sedimentary depositions probably made the diversification of early animal life possible. The orogen was eroded to such extent that by the Ordovician epoch it had been leveled to a planation surface in Ethiopia. Cenozoic reopening The Cenozoic East African Rift System mostly evolved along the complex pattern of Proterozoic prerift systems in eastern Africa. It passes through the Mozambique Belt east of the Tanzania Craton.

Biography Early life Kerry Norton was born as Norma-Jean Norton on 7 December 1927. She was an A-grade student throughout her school life, excelling in English and Grammar. Career In February 1947, Norton screen tested for a role in director Roy Darling's movie, The Intimate Stranger. Although filming began that April, the movie was never completed. Her first stage appearance was a minor role in Garson Kanin's Born Yesterday in 1948 for J. C. Williamson at the Royal. At the same time when she was taking acting lessons at the Independent, and in 1949 she took part in the Independent's production of Father Malachy's Miracle. That same year she auditioned for Macquarie's radio station 2GB and gained an A-Grade pass, which meant she started acting for 2GB almost immediately. That year she was in Kay Keavney's radio serial Nurse White; she also appeared on the radio as Diana Reed in Superman. She was in the Caltex Theater play Prison Without Bars, which starred Babs Mayhew, Peter Bathurst, and Betty McDowall. At the same time she was working as a secretary to 2GB writer Bob MacKinnon, typing his scripts as he dictated them. She said that anyone who wanted to make a career as an actress should have a permanent job until well established. This secretarial stint came to an end early in 1950. On 2UE she won the important role of Angel White in Hagen's Circus, written by Max Afford; she was in episodes of I Hate Crime, starring Ken Wayne as Larry Kent; and she was part of the team working with comedian Mo McCackie in Cavalcade. For 2GB she was in the serial Kitty Foyle, and she had her first starring role in the Caltex Theater in Adam and Evelyne with Reg Goldsworthy. On stage, she replaced Betty Lucas, who was leaving for England, in One Wild Oat at the Palace Theatre. This was followed by Madam Louise. Both these light comedies were written by Vernon Sylvaine. After the Sydney season, Norton toured in both of these productions to the Kings Theater in Melbourne. She then started working with Jack Davey in The Club Show, continuing to work with him for more than two years, when she went to America. Important parts in radio plays continued in 1951: a lead in the Actor's Choice play A Star Reborn on 2UE; the General Motors Hour play He Came To Stay, starring Allan Trevor, and the Caltex play The Dark Corner, starring Neva Carr Glyn and Moray Powell on 2GB. On stage she acted with Hollywood comedian Mischa Auer in Benn Levy's comedy Springtime For Henry, which played at the Theater Royal in Sydney, toured New South Wales country towns, then played in Hobart, Tasmania. At the Independent, she appeared in Anna Lucasta, a play by Phillip Yordan, starring American actress Ellen Morgan. Around this time, Norton reached what she considered the peak of her radio career. Ron Beck, former producer of the Colgate-Palmolive shows, had entered into production with his own company. He obtained scripts of Blondie, an American show based on Chic Young's comic strip of the same name, and set about producing an Australian version of them. Willie Fennell played Dagwood Bumstead, Blondie's rather put-upon husband, but competition for the title role was very keen. Norton won it from a large field of auditioning actresses. Blondie went to air in November 1951, but its run was not to be a long one, as the threat of legal action from the United States brought it to an abrupt end. Norton did a good deal of radio work for the ABC: Anna in Clifford Odets' Golden Boy; Letta in Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman, starring Edward Howell; roles in Rex Rienits' Wide Boy, Elmer Rice's Counselor-at-Law, and the serial Stranger Come In, written and produced by Max Afford. On stage she played Olive in John Van Druten's The Voice Of The Turtle produced by Sydney John Kay for the Mercury Theater, and at the Metropolitan Theater she was in the satirical revue Merry-Go-Round, produced by Bill Orr, the forerunner of the Phillip Street Revues. Personal life On 8 March 1954, Norton married Jack Smyser, an executive from Pan American Airways. Later that month they went to the United States to live. After the sudden death of her husband and later her son, Norton-Smyser returned to Australia, where she now lives in Carlton, Sydney. Reception Tom Breen, theater critic for the Sydney Sun, wrote in a derogatory manner about the production Ladies' Night In A Turkish Bath at the Empire Theater in 1951, but when he came to discussing the cast, he noted: \\"Kerry Norton was curvacity itself, and her script delivery had a sure-fire quality about it that made her outstanding.\\" Commenting on her performance in Anna Lucasta, Breen wrote: \\"Kerry Norton was noteworthy for her devastatingly real depiction of a waterfront harlot.\\" Norton was thrilled with the a good notice, but said, \\"I don't know if I was real or not. I've never met a waterfront harlot.\\" References Category:Living people Category:Australian stage actresses Category:1927 births ","title":"Kerry Norton-Smyser"},{"id":"24959175","text":"Elliott Wood Partnership, London Office Elliott Wood Partnership is a structural and civil engineering practice, providing services for all engineering aspects of the built environment.

It is being broadcast on ZDF, the second German public television channel since 1995. Synopsis Stubbe chronicles the life of Wilfried Stubbe (Wolfgang Stumph), a Hamburg police detective, in a both work- and family-related way. Stubbe lives with his daughter Christiane (Stephanie Stumph), his wife Caroline (Marie Gruber/Renate Kr√∂√üner) ‚Äî until the character's death in the episode \\"Auf Liebe und Tod\\" ‚Äî and his aunt-in-law Charlotte (Margret Homeyer); the family moved to Hamburg from his hometown of Dresden at the beginning of the series. Together with his colleague Bernd Zimmermann (Lutz Mackensy), Stubbe has to solve a variety of criminal acts committed in all circles of the Hamburg society. Production Stubbe is produced in Hamburg. The house in which Stubbe lives is located in the district of Moorfleet directly at the dike. Apart from Hamburg, other locations were used to film some sequences, for example Boizenburg and Dresden. Characters * Wolfgang Stumph as Wilfried Stubbe - Stubbe is the main focus of the show. He is a quiet and professional detective with the Hamburg police with a sense of humor. Unlike his colleague, Zimmermann, Stubbe is more receptive to emotions who often trusts his gut. After his wife's death, he has a hard time trying to cope with the new role as a widower. * Lutz Mackensy as Bernd Zimmermann - Zimmermann is Stubbe's counterpart and colleague. Unlike Stubbe, he prefers to deal with facts. * Marie Gruber and Renate Kr√∂√üner as Caroline Stubbe - Stubbe's wife and mother of Christiane. She works as a saleswoman in the beginning but then founded her own business. She dies due to an embolism after being hit by a car in the episode Auf Liebe und Tod. * Stephanie Stumph as Christiane Stubbe - Christiane is Stubbe's daughter. After the death of her mother, she moves out and begins to study journalism. * Margret Homeyer as Charlotte Hoyn - Charlotte is Caroline's aunt who goes on to live with Stubbe. She often has weird hobbies and her character serves as a running gag in the show. Reception Stubbe is the most successful ZDF detective series, with 6-7 million viewers on average and 15-20% market share. The series has been praised for the way it displays a police inspector with real family troubles to handle. Wolfgang Stumph has received several awards for his portrayal of Stubbe, amongst them the Bayerischer Fernsehpreis in 2004. Since the median age of the ZDF audience is 58, Stubbe has successfully been used to attract younger audiences with storylines that focus more on the problems of teenagers and almost half its audience is younger than 50.

A right-handed opening batsman and occasional right-arm medium pace bowler, she played 10 Test matches for Australia between 1984 and 1987, scoring a century against England in her penultimate Test match in August 1987. She has also played 23 One Day Internationals for Australia, scoring 1,034 runs with two centuries and eight half-centuries at an average in the high-fifties. She was the first woman to score 1,000 runs in ODIs for Australia. Early career Urged by her father, Ian, to take up cricket, Reeler didn't start playing until she was 15, and then lacked the self-discipline to truly progress. A move to opening batsman changed that, and gave her the self-confidence to improve. As a teenager, she played for Ravenswood, but craving greater competition, she trained and played with the boys at nearby Barker College. She appeared for New South Wales Breakers at the age of 19, taking one wicket and scoring five runs in a drawn two-day match with South Australia. She made just three appearances in her maiden season, all coming in January 1981. The following season saw her play in all but one of New South Wales' ten Australian Women's Cricket Championships matches, and she was rewarded with her first half-century for the club, as she top-scored with 53 against Western Australia. The 1982/83 season saw her average drop to 9.00, as she scored 36 runs in her four matches, but 1983/84 saw her hit far better form. In her opening match of the season, she scored 70 to help New South Wales set a first-innings declaration total of 166, although opponents Queensland rallied with 277 in their second innings and the match finished a draw. Two matches later, she hit 164 runs in 236 minutes, including 22 fours against Australian Capital Territory. International career Fifteen days after her century for New South Wales, she made her international debut for Australia during their tour of India. Batting at number four, she was named Player of the Match as she scored 60 runs and put on 80 with Trish Dawson for the fourth-wicket, helping her team to chase down the Indian total. She opened the batting for Australia for the remainder of the tour, adding 85 further ODI runs and trailing only Dawson in ODI runs in the series. Her Test debut came in the same series, where she performed solidly but less emphatically. Opening the batting alongside Peta Verco in five of her six innings, Reeler scored 148 runs without making a half-century and trailed her opening partner by some way in the batting charts for the series. She didn't feature in the first two Tests against the touring English the following summer, but on her return in the Third Test made her maiden half-century in 146 balls. She failed reach 50 again in the final two Tests or the three-match ODI series, and did not appear in the subsequent series against New Zealand. In 1987, she was selected as part of the squad to tour the British Isles, and in the first ODI against Ireland she hit a match- winning 83 runs as Australia won by 110 runs. After missing the second Test, she again made a match-winning performance, passing her previous score to record 84 runs in a 105 run victory. A score of 109 in a warm-up match against Surrey Women was her first for Australia, and she made half-centuries in the first and third ODIs of the series. After a score of 3 in her solitary innings in the First Test, Reeler struggled in two matches against West and West Midlands Women. A century against a North Women side containing England captain Carole Hodges and wicketkeeper Jane Powell helped secure an Australian 166 run victory just four days before the Second Test. Reeler opened the batting in the Second Test as Australia chased an English first-innings total of 201. After losing the early wickets of Denise Emerson and Belinda Haggett, Reeler was joined at the crease by Denise Annetts. The pair put on a women's Test record partnership of 309 runs, Reeler finishing on 110* and Annetts on 193.

Since 1998, Andresen has been the owner of Ferd, one of the largest privately held companies in Norway. He served in the position of CEO from 1998 to 2012, and has been the chairman of the board since 2012. In the magazine Kapital‚Äôs list of the 400 richest Norwegians, Andresen is ranked as number five, with a net worth equaling more than USD 3.27 billion. While his father Johan H. Andresen Sr. lived, Andresen added 'Jr.' to his name, but ended this practice when his father died in 2011.  Early life  Andresen was born in 1961 in Oslo, as the son of industrialist Johan Henrik Andresen (1930‚Äì2011), and Swedish noblewoman Marianne Ebba Therese Bielke. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Government and Policy Studies from Dartmouth College in 1988, and an MBA in 1993 from the Rotterdam School of Management.  Personal life  Andresen is married to Kristin Gamlemshaug. The couple has two daughters, Katharina and Alexandra. In 2007, Andresen transferred most of the Ferd Holding shares, for an estimated value of NOK 12 billion, to his daughters. He is the grandson of Johan H. Andresen, and the great-grandson of Johan Henrik Andresen.  Professional career  Andresen was Product Manager in International Paper Co., USA from 1989 to 1991. In 1993 he became a Partner in the Norwegian industrial group Tiedemanns-gruppen. He succeeded his father as the sole owner and CEO in 1998, and thus became the fifth generation of the Andresen family in charge of the company since the first Johan H. Andresen bought the tobacco company J.L. Tiedemanns Tobaksfabrik in 1849. In 1998 the tobacco production of Tiedemanns Tobaksfabrik was merged with the Scandinavian Tobacco Company, and in 2005 Andresen sold all his shares in the company for NOK 3.3 billion. Tiedemanns-gruppen changed its name to Ferd in 2001. Today, Ferd owns Elopak, Aibel (50%),TeleComputing, Interwell and Swix Sport, among other companies, in addition to substantial portfolios of stock, hedge fund investments, Private Equity and property. The company‚Äôs net asset value has grown from NOK 7,4 billion in 2003 to NOK 24,3 billion as of year‚Äôs end 2013. In September 2006, Andresen famously attempted to acquire the Swiss packaging and former weapons producer SIG, by placing a bid of NOK 11 billion for 50.01% of the shares in the company. Andresen's plan was to merge SIG with Ferd-owned Elopak, making it the world's second largest packaging manufacturer. SIG, however, initiated a bidding war, and in March 2007 Ferd announced that it would no longer be pursuing the transaction. This would have been one of the largest acquisitions in Norwegian history.

Footpath sign showing the park's original name The park was declared in 2000 with the name \\"Fuentes Carrionas and Fuente Cobre-Monta√±a Palentina\\". The original name of the park refers to: * the Fuentes Carrionas sub-range of the Cantabrian Mountains (source of the river Carri√≥n) * Fuente Cobre (the traditional source of the river Pisuerga). It is one of a number of protected areas in the Cantabrian Mountains. From an ecological point of view, most of the park is within the Atlantic biogeographical region, but it is on the edge of that region and 4% of the area is classed as Mediterranean. Fauna In 1998 the natural park was proposed as a Site of Community Importance. In 2000 It was designated a Special Protection Area (SPA) for bird-life (reference number ES4140011) under the European Union's Birds Directive. In 2015 it was designated a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) under the Habitats Directive. Natura 2000 listing. Spanish Ministry of the Environment Birds The Cantabrian Capercaillie became extinct in the natural park at the beginning of the twenty-first century. Since 2010 the European Union's LIFE programme has supported a recovery plan for this subspecies, \\"Urgent measures scheme for the conservation of the capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus cantabricus) and its habitat in the Cantabrian mountains\\". This project was scheduled to run until 2014 across SPAs and Biosphere reserves in the region, and the natural park has been identified as a suitable site for the bird's reintroduction.Cantabrian Capercaillie Protection Scheme, Fundacion Iberdrola Urogallo Cant√°brico (LIFE+ Cantabrian Capercaillie website) Invertebrates Invertebrates include the Kerry Slug. Mammals The park is important as a habitat of the endangered Cantabrian brown bear. There is an interpretation centre for the bear at Verde√±a, Cervera de Pisuerga. Fundaci√≥n Oso Pardo, Official website of Brown Bear NGO In the twentieth century, the Cantabrian brown bears were divided into two sub-populations by habitat fragmentation. The natural park lies within the range of the eastern subpopulation, which is the smaller of the two and at risk from endogamy. In 2009 a genetic study indicated that the bears had reversed the division of their range in Spain, and there is inter-breeding between the two sub- populations. El oso cant√°brico salta la autov√≠a para reproducirse, Pedro C√°ceres, El Mundo Since 2009 the LIFE Programme has supported conservation work in the Cantabrian Mountains to enhance wildlife corridors with the aim of encouraging a natural flow of bears between sub-populations.LIFE+ Project Brown Bear Corridors , Fundaci√≥n Oso Pardo Conservation issues Hunting A national hunting reserve, the Reserva Nacional de Caza de Fuentes Carrionas, was in existence prior to the designation of the natural park, and it now forms a regional hunting reserve within the park boundaries. With an area of 49, 471 ha the hunting reserve covers the greater part of the natural park. While the hunting has been described as well-managed,Cantabrian Mountains, Large Herbivore Network there is some controversy as to whether a management regime appropriate for game species such as wild boar or deer is compatible with the interests of the protected species.El oso de Fuentes Carrionas (Palencia) fue herido en zona de caza prohibida San Glorio Ski Resort In 2004, a ski resort was proposed for the mountain pass of San Glorio which would directly impact the natural park. In 2006, the regional government relaxed the protection it had given the park in order to permit the development of a ski resort. The promoters of the project argued that it would help the local human population. There are about 2000 people living in the park. The area, like many Spanish rural districts, suffered from demographic decline in the twentieth century. Environmentalists have disputed the economics of the project as, according to official predictions, the duration of seasonal snow cover in the Cantabrian mountains was likely to be adversely affected by global warming. Environmentalists have also argued that a ski resort would be incompatible with the aim of promoting the recovery of the brown bear, given that bears would be likely to avoid such a facility and that their habitat would thus be fragmented.This view was supported by The Guardian newspaper in 2010 when it included San Glorio in a biodiversity campaign. In March 2008, the High Court of Castilla y Le√≥n ruled that the regional government's sudden change in its own planning regulations, without a proper assessment, not only went against its own regional law, but both the national law on nature conservation and the European Natura 2000 regulations. The court also noted that climate change threatened the viability of the projected ski resort.

However, despite this setback, the regional government continued to support the development. As at July 2010 the regional government was planning to submit a revised proposal to the European Union in the hope that it would not conflict with the Habitats Directive.

Formed in August 1945 at Morotai Island, it consisted of three Australian Imperial Force infantry battalions that were raised for occupation duties in the Dutch East Indies following Japan's surrender. After deployment to Timor and Ambon, it returned to Morotai when Dutch colonial rule was re-established. It was disbanded in early 1946 and its personnel demobilised. History The 33rd Brigade was formed in late August 1945 at Morotai Island. Initially the force was under the command of Brigadier Lewis Dyke, a regular Army artillery officer, who began organising the brigade before being called to fly to Darwin, where he began preparing for deployment to Timor. He subsequently led the first troops to Timor ‚Äì including elements of the 33rd Brigade ‚Äì becoming commander of Timor Force. Command of the brigade later passed to Brigadier William Steele, who remained in the role until November 1945 when Brigadier Hugh Wrigley took over. The brigade's staff was drawn from the disbanded I Corps headquarters. Upon establishment, the brigade consisted of the 12th/40th, 63rd, and 64th Infantry Battalions. Its constituent units were raised over the course of several months in mid- to late-1945: the 12th/40th in June 1945 in the Northern Territory, and 63rd and 64th in August 1945 on Morotai. The 63rd and 64th Battalions were initially raised as the 1st and 2nd Australian Reinforcement Infantry Battalions, but were re-designated shortly after being raised. All three units were formed as part of the all volunteer Australian Imperial Force. Shore party from the 33rd Brigade at Ambon, September 1945 Under Dyke's command, the 12th/40th deployed from Darwin to Timor in early September. They arrived at Koepang, in the middle of the month, shortly after the Japanese surrender on 11 September, which took place on board the survey ship HMS Moresby, in Dyke's presence just prior to him handing over as 33rd Brigade commander. At Koepang, the 12th/40th established themselves in former Dutch barracks and began patrolling and internal security duties. This included collecting Japanese prisoners of war, distributing food and supplies, identifying war criminals and overseeing Japanese security details and work parties, collecting weapons and ammunition, and reconstruction efforts. Arrangements were also made to return around 200 Australian former prisoners of war back to Darwin. Initially, it had been planned to deploy the entire brigade to Timor; however, in mid-September it was determined the situation was stable and that the rest of the brigade would deploy to Ambon, as well as sending smaller elements to the Kai, Aru and Tanimbar Islands. At this point, Steele assumed command of the brigade, and deployed an advanced party of 100 troops on Ambon from HMAS Glenelg on 22 September. These troops came from the 64th Battalion deploying from Morotai, with the remainder of the battalion arriving on 27 September. They were joined by the 63rd Battalion in early October. On Ambon, Steele took the Japanese surrender from Vice Admiral Ichise Shin'ichi, and carried out his interrogation. On Ambon, where the brigade headquarters was established, its duties included providing personnel to support war crimes trials and details to assist war graves units. There were also about 800 Australian former prisoners of war at Ambon who needed repatriation, and parade details undertook ceremonial duties as war cemeteries were established. Beyond the main areas where units of Australian troops were established, small surveillance parties were dispatched to areas in western New Guinea, as well as the Talaud Islands, Halmahera and Ternate. These parties were tasked with collecting information regarding war crimes and monitoring the Japanese efforts to maintain law and order, which led to several clashes between local civilians and the remaining Japanese. Established as an interim measure to occupy the Indies until the Dutch could return, as the Dutch forces began arriving in December 1945, the Australians began winding up their operations although they would continue for several more months. On 19 March 1946, the 12th/40th Battalion ceased operations on Timor. Around this time, the brigade returned to Morotai where its headquarters was closed.

Del Pilar, along with Jos√© Rizal and Graciano L√≥pez Jaena, became known as the leaders of the Reform Movement in Spain. Del Pilar was born and brought up in Bulakan, Bulacan. He was suspended at the University of Santo Tomas and jailed in 1869 after he and the parish priest quarreled over exorbitant baptismal fees. In the 1880s, he expanded his anti-friar movement from Malolos to Manila.. He went to Spain in 1888 after an order of banishment was issued against him. Twelve months after his arrival in Barcelona, he succeeded L√≥pez Jaena as editor of the La Solidaridad (Solidarity). Publication of the newspaper stopped in 1895 due to lack of funds. Losing hope in reforms, he grew favorable of a revolution against Spain. He was on his way home in 1896 when he contracted tuberculosis in Barcelona. He later died in a public hospital and was buried in a pauper's grave. On November 30, 1997, the Technical Committee of the National Heroes Committee, created through Executive Order No. 5 by former President Fidel Ramos, recommended del Pilar along with the eight Filipino historical figures to be National Heroes. The recommendations were submitted to Department of Education Secretary Ricardo T. Gloria on November 22, 1995. No action has been taken for these recommended historical figures. In 2009, this issue was revisited in one of the proceedings of the 14th Congress. Biography Early life (1850‚Äì1880) Marcelo H. del Pilar's baptismal register ancestral house and birthplace in Bulac√°n, Bulacan. This is now a museum- library housing del Pilar memorabilia.. Marcelo Hilario del Pilar y Gatmait√°n was born on August 30, 1850, in Cupang (now Barangay San Nicol√°s), Bulac√°n, Bulacan.. He was baptized \\"Marcelo\\" on September 4, 1850.. \\"Hilario\\" was the original paternal surname of the family. The surname of Marcelo's paternal grandmother, \\"del Pilar\\", was added to comply with the naming reforms of Governor-General Narciso Claver√≠a in 1849. Del Pilar's parents belonged to the principal%C3%ADa. The family owned rice and sugarcane farms, fish ponds, and an animal powered mill.. His father, Juli√°n Hilario del Pilar, was a well known Tagalog speaker in their town.. He was also a well known poet and writer. Don Juli√°n served as a \\"three-time\\" gobernadorcillo of his pueblo and later held the position of oficial de mesa of the alcalde mayor.. Blasa Gatmait√°n, del Pilar's mother, was a descendant of the noble Gatmait√°ns. She was known as \\"Do√±a Blasica\\". The ninth of ten children, del Pilar's siblings were: Toribio (priest, deported to the Mariana Islands in 1872),. Fernando (father of Gregorio del Pilar),. Andrea, Dorotea, Estanislao, Juan, Hilaria (married to Deodato Arellano),. Valent√≠n, and Mar√≠a. The share of the inheritance of each child was very small and del Pilar renounced his share in favor of his siblings. From an early age, del Pilar learned the violin, the piano, and the flute.. He received early education from his paternal uncle Alejo del Pilar.. He later studied Latin in the private school owned by Sr. Jos√© Flores.. After his education under Sr. Flores, del Pilar enrolled at the Colegio de San Jos√©, where he obtained his Bachiller en Artes degree in 1860. He pursued law and Philosophy at the Universidad de Santo Tom√°s.. In 1869, del Pilar acted as a padrino or godfather at a baptism in San Miguel, Manila. Since he was not a resident of the area, he questioned the excessive baptismal fee charged by the parish priest. This angered the parish priest and as a result, the judge, F√©lix Garc√≠a Gavieres, sent del Pilar to Old Bilibid Prison (then known as Carcel y Presidio Correccional). He was released after thirty days.. Cavite Mutiny in 1872. During the time of the Cavite Mutiny in 1872, del Pilar was living with a Filipino priest named Mariano Sevilla. Sevilla was deported to the Mariana Islands along with del Pilar's eldest brother, Fr. Toribio Hilario del Pilar, due to allegations of being one of the organizers of the uprising.. The deportation of Fr. Toribio resulted in the early death of del Pilar's mother. Out of the university, del Pilar worked as oficial de mesa in Pampanga (1874‚Äì1875) and Quiapo (1878‚Äì1879).. In the month of February 1878, he married his second cousin Marciana (the \\"Chanay/Tsanay\\" in his letters) in Tondo.. The couple had seven children, six girls and one boy: Sof√≠a, Jos√©, Mar√≠a, Rosario, Mar√≠a Consolaci√≥n, Mar√≠a Concepci√≥n, and Ana (Anita). Only two girls, Sof√≠a and Anita, survived to adulthood.. In 1878, del Pilar resumed his law studies at the Universidad de Santo Tom√°s.. He earned his licenciado en jurisprudencia (equivalent to a Bachelor of Laws) in 1880.Nepomuceno-Van Heugten, Maria Lina. \\"Edukasyon ng Bayani: Mga Impluwensya ng Edukasyong Natamo sa Kaisipang Rebolusyonaryo\\" (PDF). University of the Philippines Diliman Journals Online. Retrieved June 9, 2011. After finishing law, he worked for the Real Audiencia de Manila.. Although practicing law in Manila, del Pilar spent more time in his native province. There he seized every event ‚Äì baptisms, funeral wakes, weddings, town fiestas, and cockfights at the cockpits ‚Äì to enlighten his countrymen about the state of their native country.. He also exposed the abuses of the Spanish friars and colonial authorities. Anti-friar activities in the Philippines (1880‚Äì1888) The pre-1863 lithograph photo of Malolos Cathedral before the earthquake that tore down its clock tower in 1863. This was one of the sites of del Pilar's anti- friar activities. Del Pilar, together with Basilio Teodoro Moran and Pascual H. Poblete, founded the short-lived Diariong Tagalog (Tagalog Newspaper) on June 1, 1882. Diariong Tagalog was the first bilingual newspaper in the Philippines and was financed by the wealthy Spanish liberal Francisco Calvo y Mu√±oz.. Del Pilar became the editor of the Tagalog section.. Jos√© Rizal's essay, El Amor Patrio, was featured in the Diariong Tagalog on August 20, 1882. Del Pilar translated it into Tagalog language, Ang Pagibig sa Tinub√∫ang Lup√† (Love of Country).. Malolos became the center of del Pilar's anti-friar movement. The first success of the movement was in 1885, when the liberal Manuel Cris√≥stomo was elected gobernadorcillo by the citizens of Malolos. Shortly after this victorious event, del Pilar, together with the cabezas de barangay of Malolos, clashed with the town's friar curate on the list of taxpayers.. The friar curate wanted to bloat the tax lists, a move meant for the parish's financial gain.Benigno Quiroga, 1894 In October 1887, during an upcoming fiesta in Binondo, a conflict occurred between the natives, Chinese, and Chinese mestizos. The gobernadorcillo de naturales (gobernadorcillo of the natives) of Binondo, Timoteo Lanuza, requested Fr. Jos√© Hevia de Campomanes, the friar curate of Binondo Church, to prioritize the natives over the Chinese in the fiesta.. Fr. Hevia, who sided with the Chinese and Chinese mestizos, rejected Lanuza's request and decided not to attend the celebration. Most of the attendees of the fiesta were the gobernadorcillos of Manila and the natives. A few days after the celebration, Fr. Hevia was removed as friar curate of Binondo by the liberal governor-general Emilio Terrero. The organizer of the fiesta, Juan Zulueta, was a disciple of del Pilar.. On October 18, 1887, Benigno Quiroga y L√≥pez Ballesteros, the Director General of Civil Administration in Manila, issued an executive order prohibiting the exposition of dead bodies of cholera victims in the churches.. Cris√≥stomo, the gobernadorcillo of Malolos at that time, proclaimed Quiroga's decree by means of a parade led by a brass band. Friar Felipe Garc√≠a, the friar-curate of Malolos, aggravated the authorities by parading the body of the servant of Don Eugenio Delgado. Upon the advice of del Pilar, Cris√≥stomo addressed the problem to the Spanish governor of Bulacan, Manuel G√≥mez Florio. G√≥mez Florio ordered the arrest of the friar curate.. On January 21, 1888, del Pilar worked for the establishment of a school of \\"Arts, Trades, and Agriculture\\" by drafting of a memorial to the gobernador civil of Bulacan.. This was signed by the gobernadorcillos, ex-gobernadorcillos, leading citizens, proprietors, industrialists, professors, and lawyers of the province. On the morning of March 1, 1888, the principales of the districts of Manila and the nearby provinces (led by Doroteo Cort√©s and Jos√© A. Ramos) marched to the office of the civil governor of Manila, Jos√© Centeno Garc√≠a. They presented a manifesto addressed to the Queen Regent. This manifesto, entitled \\"Viva Espa√±a! Viva el Rey! Viva el Ej√©rcito! Fuera los Frailes!\\" (Long live Spain! Long live the King! Long live the Army! Throw the friars out!), was written by del Pilar.. The manifesto enumerated the abuses/crimes of the friars and demanded their expulsion from the Philippines including Manila Archbishop Pedro P. Payo himself. A week after the demonstration, Centeno resigned and left for Spain. Governor-general Terrero's term also ended the following month. Terrero was succeeded by acting governor-general Antonio Molto.O.P. (1814‚Äì1889) was the 24th Archbishop of Manila who took charge in 1876 until his death in 1889. Jos√© Rodr√≠guez, an Augustinian priest, authored a pamphlet entitled ¬°Cai√±gat Cay√≥!: Sa ma√±ga masasamang libro,t, casulatan (Beware!: of bad books and writings, 1888). The friar warned the Filipinos that in reading Rizal's Noli Me T√°ngere (Touch Me Not) they commit \\"mortal sin\\". On August 3 of the same year, del Pilar wrote Caiigat Cay√≥ (Be as Slippery as an Eel) under the pen name Dolores Manapat. It was a reply to Rodr√≠guez's ¬°Cai√±gat Cay√≥!.. Valeriano Weyler succeeded Molto as the governor-general of the Philippines. Investigations were escalated during Weyler's term. G√≥mez Florio, the Spanish governor of Bulacan and del Pilar's friend, was removed from his position. An arrest warrant was issued against del Pilar, accusing him of being a filibustero and heretic. Upon the advice of his friends and relatives, del Pilar left Manila for Spain on October 28, 1888.. The night before he left the country, del Pilar stayed at the house of his fellow Bulaque√±o, Pedro Serrano y Lactao. Together with Rafael Enriquez, they wrote the Dasalan at Tocsohan (Prayers and Mockeries), a mock-prayer book satirizing the Spanish friars... They also wrote the Pasi√≥ng Dapat Ipag-alab nang Puso nang Tauong Babasa (Passion That Should Inflame the Heart of the Reader).. A copy of La Solidaridad (Solidarity), the principal organ of the Reform Movement in Spain. Del Pilar was also able to organize the Caja de Jes√∫s, Mar√≠a y Jos√©, the objective of which was to continue propaganda and provide education to indigent children.. He managed the organization with the assistance of Mariano Ponce, Gregorio Santill√°n, Mariano Cris√≥stomo, Lactao, and Jos√© Gatmait√°n. Caja de Jes√∫s, Mar√≠a y Jos√© was later terminated and replaced by Comit√© de Propaganda (Committee of Propaganda) in Manila. Propaganda movement in Spain (1888‚Äì1895) Del Pilar arrived in Barcelona on January 1, 1889.. He headed the political section of the Asociaci√≥n Hispano-Filipina de Madrid (Hispanic Filipino Association of Madrid).. On February 17, 1889, del Pilar wrote a letter to Rizal, praising the young women of Malolos for their bravery. These 20 young women asked the permission of Governor-General Weyler to allow them to open a night school where they could learn to read and write Spanish. With Weyler's approval and over the objections of Friar Felipe Garc√≠a, the night school opened in the early 1889. Del Pilar considered this incident as a victory to the anti-friar movement. Upon his request, Rizal wrote his famous letter to the women of Malolos, Sa Mga Kababayang Dalaga Sa Malolos (To the Young Women of Malolos), on February 22, 1889. On December 15, 1889, del Pilar succeeded Graciano L√≥pez Jaena as editor of the La Solidaridad. Under his editorship, the aims of the newspaper expanded. Using propaganda, it pursued the desires for: assimilation of the Philippines as a province of Spain; removal of the friars and the secularization of the parishes; freedom of assembly and speech; equality before the law; and Philippine representation in the Cortes, the legislature of Spain. Rizal (at the center) for a group portrait in Madrid, Spain. Photographed in 1890. In 1890, a rivalry developed between del Pilar and Rizal. This was mainly due to the difference between del Pilar's editorial policy and Rizal's political beliefs. On January 1, 1891, about 90 Filipinos gathered in Madrid. They agreed that a Responsable (leader) be elected.. Camps were drawn into two, the Pilaristas and the Rizalistas. The first voting for the Responsable started on the first week of February 1891. Rizal won the first two elections but the votes counted for him did not reach the needed two thirds vote fraction. After Mariano Ponce pleaded to the Pilaristas, Rizal was elected Responsable. Rizal, knowing the Pilaristas did not like his political beliefs, respectfully declined the position and transferred it to del Pilar. He then packed up his bags and boarded a train leaving for Biarritz, France.. Inactive in the Reform Movement, Rizal ceased his contribution of articles on La Solidaridad. After the incident, del Pilar wrote a letter of apology to Rizal. Rizal responded and said that he stopped writing for La Solidaridad for reasons: first, he needed time to work on his second novel El Filibusterismo (The Reign of Greed); second, he wanted other Filipinos in Spain to work also; and lastly, he could not lead an organization without solidarity in work. After years of publication from 1889 to 1895, funding of the La Solidaridad became scarce. Comit√© de Propaganda's contribution to the newspaper stopped and del Pilar funded the newspaper almost on his own. On November 15, 1895, La Solidaridad ceased publication, with 7 volumes and 160 issues. In del Pilar's farewell editorial, he said : Later years, illness, and death (1895‚Äì1896) Del Pilar's last years in Spain saw his descent into extreme poverty. He often missed his meals and during winter, he kept himself warm by smoking discarded cigarette butts he picked up in the streets. Suffering from tuberculosis, del Pilar decided to return to the Philippines. His illness worsened that he had to cancel his journey.. He was taken to the Hospital de la Santa Cruz in Barcelona. Del Pilar died there on July 4, 1896, a few days before the Cry of Pugad Lawin.. He was buried the following day in a borrowed grave at the Cementerio del Sub-Oeste (Southwest Cemetery). Before dying, del Pilar retracted from Masonry and received the sacraments of the church.The National Shrine of Marcelo H. del Pilar in San Nicol√°s, Bulac√°n, Bulacan Reactions after death News of his death reached the Philippines. La Politica de Espa√±a en Filipinas, the publication of the Spanish priests, paid respect to him: Ram√≥n Blanco y Erenas, the Governor-General of the Philippines at that time, eulogized del Pilar as: Return of del Pilar's remains (1920) and final interment (1984) Marcelo H. del Pilar's monument in Bulacan's provincial heroes' park at Bulacan State University. Del Pilar's remains were returned to the Philippines on December 3, 1920 and was buried initially at the Manila North Cemetery. It was later transferred to his birthplace in Bulakan, Bulacan on August 30, 1984. Historical controversy Mastermind of the Katipunan Some historians and scholars believed that del Pilar was the true mastermind of the Katipunan. According to the historian Renato Constantino, the ordinance of the Katipunan were submitted by Andr√©s Bonifacio to del Pilar for validation.. Bonifacio used the letters he received from del Pilar to recruit more Katipuneros. Kalayaan (Liberty), the official newspaper of the Katipunan, carried the pseudonym of del Pilar, Plaridel, as editor-in- chief.Arturo Ma. Misa, Del Pilar and the Katipunan (Manila: The Philippines Free Press, 1959). A copy of the letters of del Pilar was also given by Bonifacio to Deodato Arellano, del Pilar's brother-in-law and the first president of Katipunan. According to Le√≥n Mar√≠a Guerrero, del Pilar's letters were regarded by Bonifacio as important documents of the Philippine Revolution and guides for Katipunan's activities. Historical remembrance \\"Father of Philippine Journalism\\" For his 150 essays and 66 editorials mostly published in La Solidaridad and various anti-friar pamphlets, del Pilar is widely regarded as the \\"Father of Philippine Journalism.\\" Samahang Plaridel, an organization of veteran journalists and communicators, was founded in October 2003 to honor del Pilar's ideals.

It was traditionally made from the smallest fish caught by fishermen, along with olive oil, onions, and saffron. One modern recipe calls for filleted and chunked whitefish (such as cod, goliath grouper, or snapper), prawns, fish or vegetable stock, tomatoes, onions, potatoes, olive oil, lemon juice, and a garnish of flatleaf (Italian) parsley. Another calls for three or four kinds of fish cleaned and sliced for poaching (bass, cod, hake, haddock, halibut, trout, pollock, snapper, rockfish, whiting), plus shrimp and perhaps lobster or scallops, along with onions, scallions, or leeks; olive oil; tomato; stalk fennel or celery; fresh parsley; fresh thyme; bay leaf; ground black pepper; white wine and water; and toasted croutons.

Background and career thumb Worthington G. Smith was born in Shoreditch, London, the son of a civil servant. He received an elementary education at a local school and was then apprenticed as an architect. He married Henrietta White in 1856 and the couple had seven children, only three of whom survived childhood.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography http://www.oxforddnb.com/public/index.html?url=%2Findex.jsp Smith worked for the architect Sir Horace Jones, becoming an expert draughtsman and a member of the Architectural Association.Bedfordshire Libraries: Worthington George Smith http://www.galaxy.bedfordshire.gov.uk/webingres/bedfordshire/vlib/0.digitised_resources/dunstable_digitisation_people_smith_about.htm In 1861, however, he left the profession (having been required to design drains for Sir Horace) and embarked on a second career as a freelance illustrator. He put his former experience to use by producing illustrations for The Builder (a journal still published today) and continued as a regular contributor for the next twenty years. Botany and horticulture Amanita muscaria Smith had an interest in natural history and gardening, and gradually developed a reputation as a botanical illustrator. His work appeared in the Gardeners' Chronicle and in 1869 he became its chief illustrator, retaining this position for the next 40 years.Ainsworth, G.C. (1996). Brief biographies of British mycologists. Stourbridge: British Mycological Society He also contributed illustrations to the Journal of Horticulture and other periodicals. In 1880, he co-authored Illustrations of the British Flora with the noted botanical illustrator Walter Hood Fitch.Fitch WH, Smith WG. (1880) Illustrations of the British flora London: L. Reeve & Co. https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/42466#11 Mycology and plant pathology Worthington G. Smith's particular expertise was in fungi, which he collected, studied, and illustrated. He published extensively, writing over 200 articles and papers, as well as several books. His first major work in 1867 was to produce coloured illustrations of poisonous and edible fungi, printed in linen-backed poster format with an accompanying booklet.Smith WG. (1867). British edible and poisonous fungi. London: Hardwicke http://exhibits.mannlib.cornell.edu/mycological/Smith.htm He published Clavis Agaricinorum (a key to British agarics) in 1870, wrote a popular book on mushrooms and toadstools in 1879, illustrated Stevenson's Hymenomycetes Britannici in 1886, and produced a supplement to M.J. Berkeley's Outlines of British Fungology in 1891.Smith WG. (1891). Outlines of British Fungology. Supplement. London: L. Reeve & Co. https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/27018 In 1875, Smith published a paper describing and illustrating the overwintering spores of Phytophthora infestans, the causal agent of late blight of potatoes, the disease responsible for the Great Famine of Ireland.Smith, W.G. (1875) The resting-spores of Peronospora infestans. Quarterly Journal of Microscopic Science 60: 360-363. http://jcs.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/s2-15/60/360.pdf For this he was awarded the Royal Horticultural Society's Knightian gold medal. The German mycologist Anton de Bary pointed out that Smith had actually described some contaminating spores, but national pride upheld Smith's reputation as a plant pathologist and he was appointed to several governmental commissions on plant diseases, as well as publishing a book on the subject in 1884.Smith WG. (1884). Diseases of field and garden crops.

In 1908, he also wrote a \\"descriptive catalogue\\" of the specimens and drawings of the British Basidiomycetes held at the museum.Smith WG. (1908). Synopsis of the British Basidiomycetes. London: British Museum https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/73628#3 Worthington G. Smith was the first mycologist to lead a fungus foray. In 1868 he was invited by the Woolhope Naturalists' Field Club to be the expert leader of a field meeting dubbed \\"a foray among the funguses\\". This was so successful that the club held annual \\"forays\\" for the next 24 years. Smith helped publicize the club and its forays with a series of cartoons in various journals, some of them caricaturing the leading mycologists of the day. He also designed illustrated menus in similar style for the club's annual fungus dinners at the Green Dragon in Hereford. Smith became an honorary member of the club and in 1874, as a token of appreciation, was presented with a set of cutlery engraved with fungi taken from his illustrations. In 1896 Worthington G. Smith became a founder member of the British Mycological Society and was elected its President in 1904. He was also a Fellow of the Linnean Society. Smith's reputation as a mycologist and plant pathologist has been overshadowed by the more lasting achievements of his contemporaries. His book on plant diseases was said to have been \\"out of touch\\" when published and C.G. Lloyd claimed his Synopsis of the British Basidiomycetes resembled \\"an attempt by someone living in the Sahara to write a book about a rain forest.\\"http://www.mushroomthejournal.com/greatlakesdata/Authors/WGSmith933.html#Bio Many of the new fungal species described by Smith have been relegated to synonymy, though those that remain current include the agaric Leucoagaricus georginae (W.G. Sm.) Candusso and the bolete Rubinoboletus rubinus (W.G. Sm.) Pil√°t & Dermek.http://www.basidiochecklist.info/ Smith's collections are now held in the mycological herbarium at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. The species Agaricus worthingtonii Fr., Clitopilus smithii Massee, and Geastrum smithii Lloyd were named after him.http://www.indexfungorum.org/Names/Names.asp Archaeology Old House at West Gate, Pembroke. Published in Archaeologia Cambrensis, April 1881. Worthington G. Smith's reputation as an archaeologist, specializing in the palaeolithic era, has grown rather than diminished. Of the five Lower Palaeolithic occupation sites known from Britain, four were discovered by Smith. He became interested in the subject after reading Sir John Evans's Ancient Stone Implements of Great Britain (1872). In 1878 he found stone tools in building excavations at Stoke Newington Common and traced the tool-bearing layer over a wide area of north-east London. He discovered a similar site at Caddington, Bedfordshire, and published his findings in Man, the Primeval Savage (1894). He subsequently found further sites at Whipsnade and elsewhere, as well as making other archaeological discoveries in the Bedfordshire area.White, Mark J. The earlier Paleolithic occupation of the Chilterns : re- assessing the sites of Worthington G. Smith (Antiquity, Dec 1997). Between 1887 and 1890, Smith acted as an assistant to Stephen Williams on his excavation in Mid-Wales on the Cistercian Abbeys at Strata Florida, Strata Marcella and Abbey Cwmhir. He undertook the surveying on these sites and drawing the finds for publication.Williams, David Henry (1995).‚ÄùThe Exploration and Excavation of Cistercian Sites in Wales‚Äù, Archaeologia Cambrensis, Vol 144, 7-9. Plate 5 reproduces a photograph of Smith at work Smith also attended the summer meetings of the Cambrian Archaeological Association regularly between 1875 and 1895.\\"Williams\\", pg 8 Smith became the local county secretary for the Society of Antiquaries in 1897. In 1902 he was awarded a civil-list pension of ¬£50 per annum \\"for services to archaeology\\" on the recommendation of Lord Avebury and Sir John Evans. The items he discovered are now dispersed, but some of his collections are held at the British Museum, Luton Museum, and the Museum of London. A freeman of Dunstable For reasons of health, Smith moved to his wife's home town of Dunstable, Bedfordshire, in 1884. There, he not only pursued his mycological and archaeological interests, but also investigated the history of the town. Amongst other things, he discovered and translated the charter granted to the town by King Henry I. As a result of his researches, he wrote an extensive book called Dunstable, its history and surroundings, published in 1904 and reprinted in 1980. In 1903 he became the first freeman of the borough of Dunstable, \\"in appreciation of the eminent services rendered to his country in connection with his profession, and his munificent gifts to the Corporation\\".

Preparation Palmiers are made from puff pastry, a laminated dough similar to the dough used for croissant, but without yeast. Puff pastry is made with alternating layers of dough and butter, rolled and folded over to create possibly hundreds of flaky layers. The puff pastry is rolled out, coated with sugar, and then the two sides are rolled up together so that they meet in the middle, making a roll that is then cut into about slices and baked. Usually it is rolled in sugar before baking. Varieties In the Puerto Rican version, it is topped with honey. In Mexico and other Latin American countries they are known as orejas (ears). In Chinese, they are known as butterfly pastries. In Greek they are usually known as little glasses (Œ≥œÖŒ±ŒªŒ¨Œ∫ŒπŒ±). Germans call them pig's ears (Schweineohren) while the Swiss call them Prussiens or \\"coeur de France\\". In Catalonia and Valencia they are called ulleres (eyeglasses) or palmeras. In Spain they are called palmeras (palm trees), and they can be topped with coconut or chocolate.. In Japan since 1965, available as a popular snack, have been known as Genji Pie.

Playing career Morgan began his career at Tranmere Rovers, making his debut on 27 August 1996 in a 2‚Äì0 victory over Port Vale before spending time on loan at Conference National side Altrincham. The following season, Morgan began to establish himself in the first team at Prenton Park, making 23 appearances in all competitions. Rovers fought their way to the 2000 League Cup Final and with Morgan as an unused substitute, they were defeated 2‚Äì1 by Leicester City. However continuing injury problems restricted his first team appearances in the following years and, in 2002, he was allowed to join Doncaster Rovers on a free transfer. He played just three times for Doncaster before being released and instead moved to Morecambe in December 2002. After a spell with Porthmadog, Morgan took over as player-manager of Welsh Premier League side NEWI Cefn Druids, replacing Steve O'Shaughnessy in February 2004. However, he spent just 10 months in the role before stepping down in December 2004 and moving to Rhyl, where he made one appearance before ending his first team playing career at Connah's Quay Nomads.

The bacterium has a number of features that allows it to be distinguished from S. pneumoniae: * There is no pneumococcal capsule (and is therefore not typable). * It is not soluble in bile. * It is sensitive to optochin when incubated in ambient air, but appears resistant or to have indeterminate susceptibility when incubated in 5% carbon dioxide. * Commercial DNA probe hybridization tests (e.g., AccuProbe Streptococcus pneumoniae culture identification test; Gen-Probe, San Diego, CA) are falsely positive.

He served as the League's general from 150‚Äì149 BC and from 148 BC until his death. Dispute with the Lacedaemonians Diaeus was probably a son of Diophanes of Megalopolis, who had been a successful general of the Achaean League in 192/91 BC and who was himself the son of another Diaeus. A member of the Arcadian aristocracy in the Achaean confederation, which comprised by then the entire Peloponnese, the younger Diaeus was elected strategos of the Achaean League in 150 BC, succeeding Menalcidas of Sparta. Menalcidas had been charged by Callicrates with a capital offence, but saved himself by gaining the support of Diaeus, whom he bribed with three talents. Diaeus was generally blamed for this and, trying to divert public attention away from his own conduct, he sought a quarrel with Lacedaemon. The Lacedaemonians had appealed to the Roman senate over the possession of some disputed land. In response, the Roman senate had said that decisions on all causes, except those of life and death, rested with the great council of the Achaeans. Diaeus decided to ignore the exception included in the Roman response. The Lacedaemonians accused him of lying and the dispute led to war. However, the Lacedaemonians found themselves no match for the Achaeans, and they sought to negotiate. Diaeus, affirming that his hostility was not directed against Sparta as a whole, but against those who had caused the disagreement, arranged for the banishment of 24 of Sparta's principal citizens. These men fled to Rome and sought Rome's refuge and protection. Diaeus travelled to Rome to oppose their claims, together with Callicrates, who died along the way. The cause of the Spartan exiles was supported by Menalcides, who assured the Spartans, on his return, that the Romans had declared in favour of their independence, while an equally positive assurance to the opposite effect was given by Diaeus to the Achaeans. In truth, the Senate had made no final decision, but had promised to send commissioners to settle the dispute. War with Rome In 148 BC, war was renewed between the parties despite such action being prohibited by the Romans. However, Diaeus, who was again general of the Achaean league in 147 BC, did seek to obey Rome's prohibition by endeavouring to bring over the towns around Sparta by negotiation. When the decree of the Romans arrived, which severed Sparta and several other states from the Achaean league, Diaeus took a leading part in building Achaean indignation and in urging them to the acts of violence which caused war with Rome. In autumn 147 BC, Diaeus was succeeded as general of the Achaean league by Critolaus. But the death of the latter before the expiration of his year in that office once more placed Diaeus in the key position. (This outcome was based on the law of the Achaeans, which provided in such cases that the predecessor of the deceased should resume his authority.) The size of Diaeus' army was increased with emancipated slaves and by the levy of the citizens, which Diaeus enforced strictly, though not impartially. In the resulting action, Diaeus acted unwisely in dividing his forces. He sent some of them to garrison Megara and to check the advance of the Romans. Diaeus himself established his quarters in Corinth, and Metellus, the Roman general, advancing towards Corinth, sent forward ambassadors to offer terms. But Diaeus threw them into prison (though he afterwards released them for the bribe of a talent). Diaeus then had Sosicrates, the lieutenant-general, as well as Philinus of Corinth, tortured to death for having recommended negotiation with the Romans. Cessation of the Achaean League Being defeated by Lucius Mummius Achaicus before the walls of the city in the Battle of Corinth (146 BC), Diaeus made no further attempt to defend the city, but fled to Megalopolis, where he slew his wife to prevent her being captured by the enemy and then killed himself by poisoning. His death marked the end of the Achaean League as it was then dissolved by Lucius Mummius.

Along with Giovanni Mario, Gaetano Fraschini, Enrico Tamberlik and Antonio Giuglini, he was one of the most celebrated Italian tenors of his era. His voice was not large but it was exceptionally pure toned and sweet, lacking any disruptive vibrato. He sang legato passages with impressive smoothness but he could also dispatch florid music with flair and considerable agility. Career Born in Parma, Gardoni studied with Antonio De Cesari (1797‚Äì1853).See short biography in Italian, .De Cesari studied singing at Piacenza, and then at the Music Lyceum in Bologna. From 1820 he was singing teacher at the College of St Augustine at Piacenza, and, becoming a fine singer, was summoned as tenor to the Ducal Chapel in 1830 and was made stipendiary virtuoso da camera of Maria Luigia. Two years later he began teaching in Parma and at his death had become a citizen there. He made his debut as Roberto Devereux (Donizetti) in Viadana in 1840, and over the following 7 years made his career in France, Italy and Germany.Rosenthal and Warrack (1974), p. 146. In Paris in December 1844 he was Bothwell in the Paris premi√®re of Louis Niedermeyer's opera Marie Stuart at the Th√©√¢tre de l'Acad√©mie Royale de Musique opposite the soprano Rosine Stoltz,Enciclopedia della Musica (Garzanti - AA.VV.) and was with her again there for the premiere of Michael Balfe's L'√©toile de Seville in the following year.See external link Gardoni knew and worked with Balfe, who composed items particularly for him.Basil Walsh, 'Balfe in Italy', Opera Quarterly Vol. 18.4 (Autumn 2002), 484-502. The limpidity and clarity of his voice, and his ravishing upper notes (no less than his youth, charm and elegance) were greatly admired in Paris:E.g. Th√©ophile Gautier, Histoire de l'Art dramatique en France depuis vingt-cinq ans, S√©rie 3, p.305 (facsimile edition Elibron Classics, Adamant Media Corporation) . and if he was not ready for all the roles from the repertoires of Adolphe Nourrit and Gilbert Duprez, still (they thought) some Meyerbeer would have suited him well, not least Raoul in Les Huguenots.A. H. Blaze in Revue des Deux Mondes, 15 December 1844, Vol. 8, p 1106ff. Gardoni continued to sing in Paris throughout his career.Elizabeth Forbes, Biographical notice (see external link). England: Her Majesty's Theatre 1847-1852 Gardoni as a young man In 1847 he went to London, where he performed regularly until 1874. Sought by rival impresarios in France and Italy, he was purchased from the Paris Op√©ra for Her Majesty's Theatre by Benjamin Lumley for 60,000 Francs, to compensate his public for the departure from their stage of Mario. Having been introduced through the Puzzi salon in Jermyn Street,Mrs Pitt Byrne, Gossip of the Century (Downey, London 1899), II, 185-191. his first London stage appearance was in February 1847 in La favorita with Mme Sanchioli: both his principal arias were encored with much enthusiasm for his vocal purity of taste and feeling. His histrionic powers were faultless, except that he lacked the force to portray bursts of passion.Benjamin Lumley, Reminiscences of the Opera, pp.171-173. There followed La sonnambula with Mme Castellan (the dramatic soprano who also partnered Lumley's tenore robusto Gaetano Fraschini), and I puritani and L'elisir d'amore (with Castellan and Luigi Lablache), and he rapidly became a great favourite.Lumley Reminiscences, 178-79, 181-82. Gardoni took a minor role in Jenny Lind's London debut in Robert le diable, with Josef Staudigl, Fraschini, Castellan and others, in the presence of Queen Victoria: he partnered Lind in La sonnambula (and La figlia del reggimento?) soon afterwards.Lumley Reminiscences, 185-86, 189. On 22 July 1847 he created the tenor role in Verdi's I masnadieri opposite Lind, Lablache and Filippo Coletti,For two engraved scenes, see 'The Theatres', Illustrated London News 31 July 1847, p. 77 (Pdf 4/27). the first two nights being under the composer's baton, and thereafter under Balfe's.Julian Budden, The Operas of Verdi (Cassell), vol 1, p. 314. At the salon of Henry Greville he was associated with Mario, Grisi, Pinsuti and others.Charles Santley, Student and Singer. The Reminiscences of Charles Santley (Edward Arnold, London 1892), p. 162. In the 1848 season he was Lumley's leading tenor. Il barbiere di Siviglia with Sophie Cruvelli and Belletti was followed by the London premiere of Verdi's Attila, with Cruvelli, Velletti and Cuzzani. He sang Gennaro to Cruvelli's Lucrezia Borgia.Lumley Reminiscences, 214-217. Sims Reeves, then attempting to establish his own place on the Italian dramatic stage in London, agreed with Lumley to appear in the lesser role of Carlo in Linda di Chamounix (supporting Eugenia Tadolini) in the hope of playing Edgardo in Lucia di Lammermoor, Percy in Anna Bolena and Arturo in I puritani, which were billed for the (sensational) return of Jenny Lind. But Gardoni was cast as Edgardo, and Reeves severed his engagements. There was a cry of 'Sims Reeves' from the gallery as Gardoni sang Edgardo's first cavatina on the opening night.Mrs W. Pitt Byrne & Rachel H. Busk, Gossip of the Century: personal and traditional memories--social, literary, artistic, etc (Downey 1899), 190-94. Read here The situation probably arose through Lind expressing a preference for Gardoni as her partner: obligingly he also stepped in as Carlo.Charles E. Pearce, Sims Reeves: Fifty Years of Music in London (Stanley Paul & Co., London 1924), 115-122. Gardoni now sang Roberto for Lind, but was thought not up to the part.Lumley Reminiscences, 221. But at her final performance at Her Majesty's, in Robert le diable on 10 May 1849 (before a royal and distinguished audience), Gardoni led Jenny Lind onto the stage to receive her rapturous applause.Ferris 2008, p. 93. After a winter season in St Petersburg, in 1850 he reappeared with Parodi and Frezzolini in a revival of I Capuleti e i Montecchi (as Tebaldo), and pleased his audience by disproving a false report of his death.Lumley Reminiscences, 282-83. June 1850 saw a premi√®re of Hal√©vy's La tempesta in which as Fernando he partnered Sontag's Miranda, Carlotta Grisi's Ariel, Colini's Prospero and the celebrated impersonation of Caliban by Lablache, directed by Balfe.Gossip of the Century (cited above), 167-68. Read here, Gardoni and the star contralto Marietta Alboni were the lead soloists, in the presence of Queen Isabella II, in the 1850 inaugural performance of La favorita at the Teatro Real in Madrid.See external link . 1851 renewed Gardoni's Gennaro in Lucrezia Borgia. A novelty premi√®re, Giulio Alary's Le tre nozze, with Henriette Sontag and Lablache, preceded the more significant L'enfant prodigue of Auber with Sontag, Massol and Coletti. He was with Cruvelli again for a special performance of Balfe's opera I quattro figli.Lumley Reminiscences, 304, 308, . When Reeves and Cruvelli sang Fidelio in 1851, Gardoni led the hand-picked soloists forming the chorus of prisoners on the first night. In Lumley's operatic concerts, also, Reeves, Gardoni and Calzolari formed a 'three tenors' trio for Curschmann's Evviva Baccho, and took part in a triplicated version of Martini's trio Don't tickle me, I pray with Henriette Sontag, Sophie Cruvelli and Jenny Duprez as soprani, and three bassi including Lablache.Pearce 1924, 164. He continued to sing for Lumley through his crisis months of early 1852, and gave a Norma with Cruvelli and Lablache: but after Cruvelli's defection he, too, slipped away from Lumley's Company.Lumley Reminiscences, 335, 342. In 1852 he was with Reeves, Pauline Viardot-Garcia, Louisa Pyne, Charlotte Sainton-Dolby and Karl Formes in first oratorio performances of Dr Bexfield's Israel Restored and Hugh Pearson's Jerusalem at the Norwich Festival.Pearce 1924, 170. England 1854-1872 Italo Gardoni circa 1860 In 1855, when Michael Costa produced his oratorio Eli in the Birmingham Festival, with Viardot, Castellan, Reeves and Formes, Gardoni was in the audience with Mario and Enrico Tamberlik, and afterwards they went in a group to pay Reeves a large compliment.Pearce 1924, 182. Gardoni himself appeared in Rossini's opera Il conte Ory with Constance Nantier-Didi√©e and Angiolina Bosio, an 'exquisite' combination of voices.H.F. Chorley, Thirty Years' Musical Recollections (Hurst & Blackett, London 1862) Vol II, 252. In 1857 he participated in the second Lyceum season (while the new Covent Garden theatre was awaited). H. F. Chorley praised his performance of Auber's Fra Diavolo, with Angiolina Bosio, Mlle Marai, Giorgio Ronconi and Pietro Neri-Baraldi, with Joseph Tagliafico and Charles Zelger as the Brigands.H.F. Chorley, Thirty Years, II, 275. During the later 1850s Gardoni appeared often at Covent Garden, including performances of Alfredo in La traviata for Michael Costa in 1858 and 1859. After Meyerbeer had re-drafted his Ein Feldlager in Schlesien for Paris as L'√©toile du nord (1854), an Italian version was presented for the British premiere, at Covent Garden. For this, Meyerbeer added the Act 1 polonaise and the romanza Disperso il crin sul mesto sen for Gardoni in the role of Danilowitz.A. H. Blaze, Revue des Deux Mondes, 1 July 1867 (PDF page 8). Gardoni also took the role of Corentin in the British premiere of Meyerbeer's Dinorah (Le pardon), at Covent Garden, in 1859,Elizabeth Forbes, Gardoni biography (see external link). in which Chorley praised his 'peasant poltroonery'.Chorley Thirty Years, 314. In autumn 1864, when the mentally unstable rival tenor Antonio Giuglini took up his doomed St Petersburg engagement, Gardoni joined Mapleson's autumn operatic touring party as principal tenor. (Gardoni had been one of Mapleson's vocal instructors.J. H. Mapleson, The Mapleson Memoirs 1848-1888 (Belford, Clarke & Co, Chicago 1888), Vol. I, p. 2.) Charles Santley called him > 'a fine singer, and a much better actor than he generally had credit for. He > was a very good Faust and Sir Huon, though the music of the latter did not > suit him. In Mireille he was excellent... His voice was pure: he was a > handsome man, and in parts which suited him an excellent actor. (He) could > sing any kind of music, cantabile or florid.' Santley thought him in many > ways the superior of Guiglini.Santley 1892, 211-12. His 1865 Faust was with Th√©r√®se Tietjens, Z√©lia Trebelli, Junca and Santley.Mapleson 1888, I, 146. In the 1866 season at Her Majesty's, he sang Pilade in a magnificent staging of Gluck's Iphig√©nie en Tauride, opposite Tietjens (Iphigenia), Santley (Oreste) and √âdouard Gassier (Thoas) - in which the soloists 'surpassed themselves':Mapleson 1888, I, 95. also he renewed his Corentin (Dinorah), with Ilma de Murska and Santley (Hoel), greatly to Mapleson's satisfaction.Santley 1892, 240; Mapleson 1888, 94-95. In 1867 he was Ottavio in the Don Giovanni with Christina Nilsson, Tietjens, Sinico, Gassier (the Don) and Santley (Leporello), and his Corentino was repeated.Santley 1892, 250.

Gardoni married the daughter of baritone Antonio Tamburini and (his wife) the soprano Marietta Goja.Rosenthal and Warrack, Concise Oxford Dictionary, 'Tamburini' entry. He died in Paris. Vocal character In 1869 Gardoni published a set of vocal exercises under the title: *15 Vocalises calcul√©s sur la formation du style moderne et le perfectionnement de l'art du Chant, av. Pfte. (Mainz, Schott) (4 Fl. 12 Xr.) The old entry from the Dictionary of Music and Musicians called him a 'tenore di grazia': > 'Italo Gardoni possessed what might be called only a moderate voice, but so > well, so easily and naturally produced, that it was heard almost to the same > advantage in a theatre as in a room. This was especially noticeable when he > sang the part of Florestan, in Fidelio, at Covent Garden, after an absence > of some duration from the stage. The unaffected grace of his style rendered > him as perfect a model for vocal artists as could well be found.See > wikisource References Notes Sources *Rosenthal, Harold and Warrack, John, (Eds.), Concise Oxford Dictionary of Opera London: Oxford University Press, 1974 printing *Ferris, George T., Great Singers: Vol I: Faustina Bordoni to Henrietta Sontag; Vol. II: Malibran to Titiens.

The production was unveiled on September 20, 2003 (previews started on August 14, 2003). It is the first \\"adult-themed\\" Cirque du Soleil show, billed as \\"the sensual side of Cirque du Soleil\\" or \\"another side of Cirque du Soleil\\". Created by Ren√© Richard Cyr and Dominic Champagne, Zumanity is a departure from the standard Cirque format. Intended to be for mature adult audiences only, this show is centered on erotic song, dance, acrobatics and comedy. The inspiration to create Zumanity came from multiple sources. Cirque du Soleil founder Guy Lalibert√© had been offered the chance to create two new shows in Las Vegas, and wanted something completely new and original rather than multiple similar shows that would cannibalize off of each other's sales and audiences. Another reason was that the New York-New York Hotel and Casino wanted to make their entertainment appear more \\"trendy\\". The hotel liked the concept of a more adult Cirque du Soleil performance. Lalibert√© admits that the biggest reason to produce this show was the chance to create something with riskier subject matter. He was interested in the idea of creating a show that explored human sexuality, something that was at complete odds with the other, more family-oriented Cirque du Soleil shows. \\"Our previous shows have all been family-oriented and politically correct, which is great,\\" Lalibert√© said, \\"but we're human beings, we won't hide it. We're a bunch of happy campers. We like to live new experiences. Zumanity deals with some of those experiences.\\" Refresh On January 20, 2015, a refresh of the show was introduced to the public in which roughly 30% of the show was changed from its original concept. Certain acts, including hoops, dance on TV, pompoms and aerial silks (in its original, 2 artist form) were retired. Entirely new acts included aerial chains, Aerial Dream, and Perfect Jam. Aerial silks was changed into a solo act and the Rose Boy evolved into Magnum, mostly the same routine but the dancer became a secret agent. Yanis Marshall choreographed new dance segments throughout the show, and there are multiple acts in which men dance in high heels (including Wind, Perfect Jam and for a short amount of time, the 2Men act). The show also features new and updated music, costumes, comedic acts, characters and artists. Cast Listed below are the characters currently in the show with known names. Further artists are listed in the Acts section.

Thierry Mugler designed the costumes for Zumanity; he created the costumes to enhance the sensual atmosphere and heightened sexuality of the production. Many of the costumes are highly colorful, yet some are minimal to an exaggerated extreme. Fur, feathers, leather, lace, fishnet stockings, velvet dresses, tiny corsets, cone bras, and plastic accessories were primary materials utilized to create the costumes' provocative appeal. Jonel's costume, for example, is made of stretch vinyl and is airbrushed to create a semi-nude effect; her bright red wig is made of expanded foam. Faun has fur on his pants which is made from toothbrush bristles, human hair, and yak fur. Molinier's long velvet dress was created by using a stencil and net onto which black silicone was applied. Though some characters are made to look entirely nude, the sex organs are fake pieces. For a great selection of character costumes and concept art, see Le Grand Chapiteau - Zumanity - Personages Music The studio album for Zumanity was released on March 22, 2005, under Cirque du Soleil's music label. The album contains mostly songs inspired by the show's music, and these songs were never actually used in the show. There are a few exceptions (see track list below). A promotional album entitled \\"Foreplay\\" was included with the original program. It was released on July 31, 2003, and contains select work-in- progress songs from the show's creation period.

The entry, while admiring, betrays the class attitudes of the time: Had my portrait painted again, this time by a Northampton man named Old. He is a great hulking, fair-headed yokel with a face like a harvest moon ‚Äì faintly reminiscent of Holbein‚Äôs Henry VIII. As he works he keeps up a continuous monologue ‚Äì ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs excellent ‚Äì interesting position that ‚Äì now will get the eyes‚Äù. His work is splendid though doesn‚Äôt seem to be in keeping with his character. The watercolour he did today is a fine piece of work, but is too much glamorised. I wish I could send it home ‚Äì it would dispense of all fear. The extraordinary speed with which Old could work, even under the most difficult conditions, is clearly shown by the portrait of \\"Dusty\\" Rhodes, which Old records as having been done in three minutes. The portrait of Ernest Warwick is another example of the 1000 or so portraits Old is reported to have painted, although only 18 are known to have survived.https://www.captivememories.org.uk/sites/fepow/files/upload/Two%20Portraits%20of%20Charlie%20Proctor.pdf Portrait of POW \\"Dusty\\" Rhodes.

These conflicting emotions are evident in many of his later works; both horror and beauty are shown in the woodlands scenes below. These were painted at Cupid's Green, near Hemel Hempstead, in 1959.

She defeated the Danish brig Admiral Yawl in a single-ship action during the Gunboat War,The vessel's name varies by account. Variants include: Admiral Juhl, Admiral Jawl, Admiral Juul, and Admiral Yorol. and then had a notably successful two months of prize-taking in the first year of the War of 1812. She was wrecked in 1825 off the Canadian coast and then broken up in 1830. Gunboat War Sappho was commissioned in February 1807 under Commander George Langford. On 7 September she was present at the Battle of Copenhagen. On 8 January 1808 Sappho and the Revenue Service brig Royal George, Captain Curry, chased a lugger that surrendered to Royal George. The lugger was Egl√©e, M. Olivier, of 16 guns (3 and 4-pounders), with a crew of 56 men. She was nine days out of Dunkirk and had taken one prize, Gabriel out of Yarmouth, which she had attempted to scuttle after taking the master and crew on board. , one of Sappho's sister ships, found Gabriel, but she was sinking fast and could not be saved. The frigate also joined the chase and latter shared in the prize money. The same four British vessels shared in the capture of the privateer Trente et Quarante, of 16 guns and 62 men,Lloyd's List, 15 January 1808. though the actual captor was Ringdove. Trente et Quarante was a lugger letter of marque, carrying sixteen guns, 6 and 9 pounders, of which 14 were mounted. Her complement was 66 men, of whom 65 were on board, under the command of M. Fanqueux. She was only three months old, was 16 days out of Dunkirk, and had made no captures. Captain Farquar of Ariadne wrote the letters reporting the capture of Egl√© and Trente et Quarante, and recommended that the Admiralty purchase the latter. Sappho was cruising in the North Sea and on the morning of 2 March she was sailing east off Scarborough, when she discovered an armed brig that was steering a course as if intending to cut off several merchant vessels to leeward. Sappho gave chase and at about 1330 hours fired a shot over the brig, which was flying British colours. The brig then fired a broadside at Sappho and exchanged Danish colours for the British colours she been flying to evade scrutiny. Langford immediately bore down and brought what turned out to be Admiral Yawl (or Admiral Juul, or Admiral Yorol) to close action. The engagement lasted about half an hour before Admiral Yawl struck her colours. In the exchange of fire, Sappho had one men wounded and one man injured. Admiral Yawl had two dead: her second officer and a seaman.The Gentleman's magazine, (March 1808) Volume 98, Part 1, p.249. As a result of the action Langford received promotion to Post-captain, and in 1847 all then surviving officers and crew were qualified to receive the Naval General Service Medal with the clasp \\"Sappho 2 March 1808\\". Sappho carried sixteen 32-pounder carronades and two 6-pounder guns, manned by a crew of 120 men and boys. Admiral Yawl was a brig, but unusual in that she had her armament on two decks; on her first or lower deck she had twelve 18-pounder carronades and on her second, or principal deck, she carried sixteen 6-pounder guns. Her crew consisted of 83 men and boys. The weight of the broadsides favored Sappho at 262 pounds versus 156 pounds for Admiral Yawl, as did the relative size of the crews. The Danish captain was the colourful and erratic adventurer J√∏rgen J√∏rgensen, who in 1801 had been a member of the crew, and perhaps second in command, of Lady Nelson. On Lady Nelson he participated in at least one voyage of exploration along the coast of Australia. In his autobiography he states that his father joined seven other merchants from Copenhagen jointly to purchase Admiral Yawl and present it to the Crown in a spirit of reprisal against the British after the Battle of Copenhagen (1807).s:The Convict King The Convict King. The Government commissioned, manned, and armed Admiral Yawl.It is not clear from this account whether she was a privateer or a naval vessel. Jorgenson reports that by cutting through the ice a month before it was expected that any vessel could get out, he was able to come unawares among the English traders and capture eight or nine ships before Sappho interrupted his cruise. In April Commander William Charleton replaced Langford. Charleton then sailed Sappho for Jamaica on 22 June. In 1810 Commander Thomas Graves took command, followed by Commander Edmund Denman in late 1810. Commander Hayes O'Grady had been appointed to command of her on 15 June 1810, but apparently did not take actual command until 1811.Hayes O'Grady was the father of the Irish antiquarian Standish Hayes O'Grady, and the brother of Standish Hayes O'Grady, 1st Viscount Guillamore. War of 1812 On 13 May 1812, Sappho fired on U.S. Navy Gunboat No. 168. This occurred about a month before the declaration of war.Commodore J. Rodgers of the US Navy, captured the packet ship Swallow and with it the muster-rolls of and Sappho. Rodgers reported that these indicated that one- eighth of the crew of each of the two British ships was composed of Americans.On 16 March 1815 fired the last shots of the war when she accidentally fired on Gunboat No. 168 in Wassaw Sound, off Georgia. After No. 168 struck, the British captain apologized, stating that he had not given any order to fire. Fortunately, Erebuss shots had not caused any casualties. Sappho had intervened to enable the merchant vessel Fernando (or Fernandeno), to escape the port of Fernandina, Florida's Port of Fernandina. With the approval of President James Madison and Georgia Governor George Mathews, insurgents known as the \\"Patriots of Amelia Island\\" had seized the island. After raising a Patriot flag, they replaced it with the flag of the United States. American gunboats under the command of Commodore Hugh Campbell, maintained control of the island in an attempt to secure East Florida to prevent a Spanish-English alliance in the area in advance of the war. In late 1812 Sappho took some nine prizes: *21 August - \\"American droits\\" Correa de la Havanah. *31 August - Santa Maria, bound to Malanzas, laden with provisions. *8 September - General Apodaca, bound for Philadelphia with a cargo of sugar, etc. *15 September - Alexander (or Alejandro), bound to Havana, laden with flour. *26 September - Schooner Josepha, from Baltimore to Havana; together with Rattler. *27 September - Sloop Molly (or Polly) from Philadelphia to Havana; together with Rattler. *11 October - Schooner Blanche, recaptured, with cargo of dry goods. Another account gives the date as 21 October. *13 November - Schooner Flora from San Domingo to Turk's Island. *26 November - Schooner Mary from Santiago to Alexandria, Virginia. Sappho brought Mary into Jamaica two days later.Lloyd's List (LL) ‚Ññ4745.. Sappho also sent into Nassau Josefe, Veya, master. A Spanish vessel suspected of carrying American goods.LL ‚Ññ4734. On 20 June 1813, the US schooner Carolina chased a British 14-gun privateer for three hours when an 18-gun British brig, which the Carolina's captain believed to be Sappho, approached. The two British vessels then set off in pursuit of the American schooner, which, however, after a chase of just over two hours, outdistanced them. The next day Carolina encountered the same British brig again, and again was able to escape. On 17 July Sappho recaptured Eliza. Three days earlier, the American privateer Saucy Jack, of seven guns and 110 men, had captured Eliza, Lane, master, and Sisters, Butterfield, master, near the Tortugas as they were sailing from Bermuda to Jamaica. Sappho took Eliza into Jamaica.LL ‚Ññ4809. Next, Sappho recaptured the brig San Francisco Xavier on 3 December. A Carthaginian privateer had captured San Francisco off Baracoa as she was sailing from Teneriffe and Puerto Rico to Havana. Sappho took San Francisco into Jamaica.LL, ‚Ññ4841.Prior to the recapture in 1816 by monarchist forces of the privateer base at Cartgena de Indias, privateers operating out of the port were known as \\"Carthagenians\\". Two days later Sappho captured a Carthagenian privateer. On 1 January 1814 Sappho captured Ann. On 7 June 1814, O'Grady advanced to Post-captain while with Sappho on the Jamaica station.Marshall (1829), Supplement, Part 3, p.353. Post-war Sappho underwent repairs at Chatham in 1815. However, she was not fitted for sea until February to May 1818. On 2 February 1818 she was recommissioned under Commander James Hanway Plumridge, for Cork. He commanded her at Saint Helena and the Irish station. On 13 August 1820 Sappho and Plumridge captured the American vessel Liberty, and the next day they captured the American vessel Clinton, both smugglers. On 12 October Sappho captured the American smuggling schooner Maria. One of the three vessels had 400 bales of tobacco.Marshall (1830), Supplement, Part 4, p.402-3. Commander Henry John Rous took command in November 1820. In early 1821 Sappho sailed to Cape Town via Lisbon. In Lisbon she took on six survivors from , which had burnt in the North Atlantic while carrying emigrants from Scotland to South Africa.Thomas Reid, SV/PROG - accessed 12 April 2018. Commander William Bruce replaced Rous in March 1822. In February 1822 she was under Commander Jenkin Jones for the Halifax station. Still, on 16 November 1823 Sappho picked up some spirits at sea. For this the Board of Customs granted a reward to her officers and men. In April 1824 Commander William Hotham took command. His replacement in April 1825 was Captain W. Canning. On 14 September Sappho arrived at Halifax in some distress. She had lost the head of her foremast and foretop-mast on 26 August on her passage to Bermuda from Portsmouth. Falling spars had killed one man and wounded four others. Then Sappho struck on the Sisters Rocks in coming into the harbour. The weather was moderate so she was soon off again. The Ship List Loss Although Sappho had been refloated, a survey resulted in her being condemned as unseaworthy and so on 16 November she was paid off. On 20 November her officers boarded . She left the next day and arrived at Plymouth on 14 December. The Admiralty finally ordered her broken up in 1828, which order was executed in July 1830.

According to the Handbook of Texas, the community had an estimated population of 75 in 2000. The 1905 Willow City School was added to the National Register of Historic Places in Texas on May 6, 2005. Geography Willow City is located at (30.4007508, -98.7014248). It is situated along FM 1323 in northeastern Gillespie County, approximately 12 miles northeast of Fredericksburg. Climate The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the K√∂ppen Climate Classification system, Willow City has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated \\"Cfa\\" on climate maps.Climate Summary for Willow City, Texas History The area was first settled before the American Civil War, and it became a gathering point for English-speaking settlers in Gillespie County, mostly inhabited by German speaking settlers around and after the War. Named simply \\"Willow\\" in 1877 when the post office was established, the growing community became \\"Willow City\\" ten years later. At the turn of the century, Willow City was home to 132 inhabitants, but this number dropped steadily since then, going as low as 17 in 1964 before settling around 75 since the 1970s. Willow City was home to the Alfred Pfeil Gin, in which a boiler exploded September 2, 1924, killing two people. The walls of one end of the building were blown out, and one end of the boiler was found more than a hundred yards away. Farmer Edgar P. Smith was killed instantly and hurled about 50 yards. His nude body, missing its legs, was found in the creek. Walter M. Icke was found near the original site of the boiler and died shortly after medical assistance arrived. Although it is unincorporated, Willow has a post office, with the ZIP code of 78675.Zip Code Lookup On December 15, 1847, a petition was submitted to create Gillespie County. In 1848, the legislature formed Gillespie County from Bexar and Travis counties. While the signers were overwhelmingly German immigrants, names also on the petition were Castillo, Pena, Munos, and a handful of non-German Anglo names.

Retrieved 2018-12-09.) was a Soviet Russian actor and film director. He graduated from the Gorky Literary Institute. After finishing the advanced directing course he directed his first film, Commissar (1967). The film was banned for more than 20 years and put an end to his career as a director in the USSR. Commissar The montage of Komissar coincided with the end of the Six-Day War, and since Askoldov refused to change the ethnic origin of the Jewish family, he condemned himself to official ostracism. After making the movie, Askoldov lost his job, was expelled from the Communist Party, charged with social parasitism, exiled from Moscow and banned from working on feature films for life. He was told that the single copy of the film had been destroyed. Mordyukova and Bykov, major Soviet movie stars, had to plead with the authorities to spare him of even bigger charges. The film was shelved by the KGB for twenty years. In 1986, due to glasnost policies, the \\"Conflict Commission\\" of the Soviet Film-makers Union recommended the re-release of the movie but Goskino refused to act. After a plea from Askoldov at the Moscow Film Festival, when the dissolution of the Soviet Union was imminent, the film was reconstructed and finally released in 1988.

The website name stems from the 'Bragging Rights' which are earned on the site. The company is based in London, England. The majority of the content is user generated, although some branded videos from companies such as Tango, Adidas and Wizards of the Coast have been broadcast on the site. The site is designed to be a more niche alternative to other social networking websites. In February 2010 Bragster was acquired by Guinness World Records.  Company history  Bragster was founded in 2006 as Gottabet.com by Wim Vernaeve, a former investment banker and Bertrand Bodson, who previously launched a DVD rental service for amazon.com. The site was started as a way to bring gambling and social networking together, but over time the gambling and betting aspect was dropped in favour of bragging and dares. The logo was changed to a blue gorilla to reflect this new \\"edgier\\" direction. Originally, the site was geared more towards social networking with features such as blogs, but these were removed as part of the re-branding, with the focus shifted purely to daring and bragging. The change was made in order for advertisers to integrate their content into the main body of the site, via sponsored dares and challenges. In February 2008, Bragster received a $3.5 million Series A investment from Intel Capital and private investor David Frankle. In February 2010, Bragster was acquired by Guinness World Records in an effort to expand GWR's digital presence. Initially the two brands will be kept separate, with plans to integrate Bragster into the GWR website in the second half of 2010. On 31 August 2010, Bragster was taken offline. Branded campaigns In March 2009, Bragster formed a long-term partnership with Britvic to promote their fizzy orange soft drink Tango. The campaign was launched by Bragster daring Tango bosses to print 2.5 million Tango cans upside down, with the Bragster logo on the top. A mock-up image of the new can was released on the website on April Fools' Day, before 2.5 million the cans went into production a few weeks later. To further promote the launch of the upside down cans, Bragster and Tango orchestrated a publicity stunt wherein a number of models in orange bikinis stood on their heads in various places around London, including St Paul's, the Tate Modern and on the tube. After the initial launch the partnership continued with ten branded dares, such as dying your hair orange and covering yourself in Tango, being issued throughout the remainder of 2009. The dares can be viewed and entered on the Tango mini-site. Also in March 2009, Bragster started a deal with Lionsgate UK to promote the film Crank: High Voltage. Two themed dares were put up on the Crank 2 Group. The first was to have a public freakout, and the second was to have your name legally changed to Chev Chelios, the anti- hero of the film. On 24 March, David Robert Smart officially changed his name by deed poll to claim a $1000 prize offered by the site. To promote their new F50i football boots, Adidas and Bragster launched the Adidas F50i Challenge, featuring seven different football orientated dares. Footballers Jermain Defoe and Ashley Young captained two opposing user teams. The challenge received 168 unique video entries. Wizards of the Coast used Bragster to launch a new Magic: The Gathering Core Set, Magic 2010. The grand prize for the best Brag uploaded was a trip to the Magic World Championship tournament in Rome for two, won by dragonangyle, with a host of smaller prizes for other entries. Wizards of the Coast also used Bragster to exclusively preview a reprinted card, Dragon Whelp. Other brands who have worked with Bragster include Warner Bros. for the UK theatrical release of action film Ninja Assassin, Nissan's sports range, MTV for the launch of rebranded channel Viva in Europe, online poker site PKR.com and 20th Century Fox for the UK DVD release of action film 12 Rounds Publicity stunts In August 2009, Bragster co-founder Bertrand Bodson appeared on TV show The X-Factor dressed as a blue gorilla, after being dared to by the rest of the Bragster team. The team agreed to donate ¬£1,000 to the charity of Bodson's choice on successful completion of the dare. The money was donated to the Gorilla Organisation. Acting on a dare by Bragster user 'whoareyou' to Bring the Bubbles, 'mr_bubble' filled the fountains at Trafalgar Square with washing up liquid, causing the fountains to fill up with foam. The stunt was covered by multiple national papers. Before Christmas 2008, Bragster projected an image of a working credit card in central London, with ¬£10,000 in credit. The 10 ft image was projected on the side of the Bank of England and a corner of Kensington High Street. Londoners who found the card were invited to spend the money on whatever they wanted. FHM's projection of a naked picture of Gail Porter on the side of the Houses of Parliament in 1999Guerrilla Marketing: Pushing the Limits  BusinessWeek was subverted by Bragster ten years after the original stunt by projecting a nude man on the side of the Tate Britain. In June 2009, Bragster offered ¬£200 for the first person to hit British National Party (BNP) leader Nick Griffin with ethnic food, as a reaction to the political leader getting pelted with eggs by political opponents. No one has claimed the prize yet. Most recently, in December 2009 Bragster repeated their \\"Christmas Cash Giveaway\\", throwing thousands of pounds worth of five-pound notes mixed with fake Bragster-branded notes out of a shop window on London's Carnaby St. References External links * Bragster.com Category:British social networking websites Category:Video hosting ","title":"Bragster"},{"id":"24959781","text":"La Solidaridad (The Solidarity) was an organization created in Spain on December 13, 1888. Composed of Filipino liberals exiled in 1872 and students attending Europe's universities, the organization aimed to increase Spanish awareness of the needs of its colony, the Philippines, and to propagate a closer relationship between the Philippines and Spain. Headed by Jos√© Rizal's cousin, Galicano Apacible, it also issued a newspaper of the same name which was published in Barcelona, Spain on February 15, 1889. It was edited by Graciano L√≥pez Jaena and later on by Marcelo H. del Pilar. The social, cultural, and economic conditions of the colonial Philippines were published in La Solidaridad. Speeches of the Spanish liberals about the Philippines were also featured in the newspaper.

History La Solidaridad was established to express the goal of the Propaganda Movement towards achieving assimilation with Spain. The first issue of La Solidaridad came out on February 15, 1889. A fortnightly and a bi-weekly newspaper, La Solidaridad serves as the principal organ of the Reform Movement in Spain. Comite de Propaganda in the Philippines funded the publication of the La Solidaridad. The editorship for the newspaper was first offered to Rizal. However, he refused because during that time he was annotating Antonio de Morga's Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas in London. After Rizal, Graciano L√≥pez Jaena was offered for the editorship of La Solidaridad and he accepted. On April 25, 1889, La Solidaridad published the letter entitled \\"The aspirations of the Filipinos\\" which was written by the Asociaci√≥n Hispano-Filipina de Madrid (). It pursued desires for: *Representation in the Cortes *Abolition of censure *An expressed and definite prohibition of the existing practices of exiling residents by purely administrative order, and without a writ of execution from the courts of justice. On December 15, 1889, Marcelo H. del Pilar replaced Graciano L√≥pez Jaena as the editor of La Solidaridad. Under his editorship, the aims of the newspaper expanded. His articles caught the attention of Spanish leaders and ministers. Using propaganda, it pursued desires for: *That the Philippines be a province of Spain *Representation Filipino priests instead of Spanish friars ‚Äî Augustinians, Dominicans, and Franciscans ‚Äî in parishes and remote sitios *Freedom of assembly and speech *Equal rights before the law (for both Filipino and Spanish plaintiffs) After years of publication from 1889 to 1895, funding of the La Solidaridad became scarce. Comite de Propaganda's contribution to the newspaper stopped and del Pilar funded the newspaper almost on his own. Penniless in Spain, del Pilar stopped the publication of La Solidaridad on November 15, 1895, with 7 volumes and 160 issues. In del Pilar's farewell editorial, he said : Notable contributors Several writers contributed to La Solidaridad over its six years of existence, like Antonio Luna, Anastacio Carpio, Mariano Ponce, Antonio Mar√≠a Regidor, Jos√© Mar√≠a Panganiban, Isabelo de los Reyes, Eduardo de Lete, Jos√© Alejandrino, and Pedro Paterno. One of the most prolific contributors though was Rizal's confidant Ferdinand Blumentritt, whose impassioned defense of the Filipino interests was said to have been inspirational to the other writers and the readers of the newspaper alike.

With the establishment of the German Nazi reign in Poland, a Judenrat of 24 members was set up in Lublin. Shmuel, Henio's father, a teacher by profession and Chairman of the Poale Zion movement in Lublin, was appointed by the Judenrat to be the manager of the post office at 2nd Kowalska Street. This role allowed him, apparently, to make contact with the Polish underground (which delivered him forbidden information and news); to correspond with his young brother, Yehuda (Leon) Zytomirski, who had already emigrated to Palestine in 1937; to be in contact with Yitzhak Zuckerman and Zivia LubetkinZariz, Ruth (1994).

By order of the Nazi German governor of Distrikt Lublin, all 34,149 Jews who then lived in the city were forced to move to the ghetto that was established in Lublin on 24 March 1941. In March 1941, the Zytomirski family moved to 11th Kowalska Street in the Lublin Ghetto. Henio's grandfather, Ephraim Zytomirski, died of typhus on 10 November 1941. Before his death he asked to be buried near the cemetery gate in order to be the first to witness the liberation of Lublin. The tombstone on his grave was smashed and destroyed in 1943 when the Nazis liquidated the new Jewish cemetery in Lublin. On 16 March 1942, the transports in freight trains from Lublin District to extermination camps began as part of \\"Operation Reinhard\\". Every day about 1,400 people were sent to the camps. The German police and SS people supervised the transports. Selection of Jews took place in the square near the municipal slaughterhouse. The deportees were led on foot from the Great Synagogue (named after the Maharshal), which served as a gathering place for the deportees. Aged and sick people were shot on the spot.Kuwalek, Robert (2003). The Ghetto in Lublin. \\"Voice of Lublin\\" Magazin no. 39, p. 5-6 The rest were sent to the extermination camps, mainly to Belzec. Hundreds of Jews were shot dead in the woods on the outskirts of Lublin. A total of about 29,000 Lublin Jews were exterminated during March and April 1942. Among them were Henio's mother and grandmother, as well as two of his aunts ‚Äì Esther and Rachel ‚Äì who were murdered in Belzec's gas chambers shortly after arrival. On 14 April 1942 the transports ended. Henio and his father survived the selections of spring 1942, apparently thanks to a work permit (J-Ausweis) that his father had. Along with the rest of the Jews who stayed alive in Lublin, they were transferred to another smaller ghetto that was built in Majdan Tatarski (a suburb of Lublin). Between 7,000 and 8,000 people entered this ghetto, although many of them did not have work permits. On 22 April the SS held another selection: about 2,500 to 3,000 people without work permits were taken first to Majdanek and from there to the Krepiec forest which is about 15 km from Lublin. There they were shot to death. On 9 November 1942, the final liquidation of the Jewish Ghetto in Majdan Tatarski occurred. About 3,000 people were sent to the extermination camp Majdanek, including Henio and his father Shmuel. Old people and children were sent immediately to the gas chamber. Nine-year-old Henio was also in this group. Henio's father, Shmuel Zytomirski, was transferred to a forced labor camp outside Majdanek, where the prisoners built a sports stadium for the SS. From the camp he managed to send a few last letters to his brother Yehuda in Palestine and to the Zionist delegation in ƒ∞stanbul. On 3 November 1943 the massive extermination of all remaining Jewish prisoners in Majdanek and the other camps in Lublin District took place. This liquidation is known as \\"Aktion Erntefest\\", which in German means \\"Harvest Festival\\". On that day 18,400 Jews were murdered in Majdanek. At the end of this killing operation, Lublin District was declared Judenrein, i.e., \\"clean of Jews\\". Surprisingly, Shmuel Zytomirski survived also this mass extermination. This is known because he sent a letter from Lublin by courier to the Jewish delegation in ƒ∞stanbul on 6 January 1944. It is not clear where this letter was sent from. The city of Lublin was captured by the Soviet Red Army on 22 July 1944. It is known for certain that Shmuel Zytomirski did not survive the Holocaust, but his cause, date, and place of death are unknown.  Letters to Henio  The \\"Letters to Henio\\" project began in the city of Lublin in 2005 as part of an activity to preserve and reconstruct the city's Jewish heritage. A local cultural center, Grodzka Gate ‚Äì NN Theatre, organizes this educational activity. According to the center's director, Tomasz Pietrasiewicz, the main idea of the project is as follows: \\"It is unacceptable to remember the faces and names of 40,000 people. Remember one. A shy smile, white shirt with a collar, colored shorts, side haircut, striped socks‚Ä¶ Henio.\\" Every year on 19 April, which is Holocaust Remembrance Day in Poland, pupils and citizens of Lublin are asked to send letters addressed to Henio Zytomirski at 11th Kowalska Street, the last known address of Henio in Lublin. Thousands of letters were sent to Henio, including paintings, personal letters and exciting stories of 12- to 13-year-old children. At the entrance to the PKO Bank, the place where Henio's last picture was taken, a special mailbox is placed every year for sending the letters to Henio. Lublin postal authorities have to deal with full sacks of letters which are sent back to senders with the post seal: \\"Unknown Addressee\\". Later in the day, participants follow a walking tour by foot and visit the addresses where Henio had lived at: 3 Szewska Street and 11 Kowalska Street (in the Ghetto). The walk ends with a silent prayer at the foot of a street lamp, which is the last remnant of the pre-war Jewish town of Lublin serving as a memorial candle. In 2007 the passengers by the bank were asked to write letters to Henio on the spot. The response was extraordinary. The national Polish press dedicates a lot of reportages to this project. Since 2005 Henio Zytomirski has become an icon of the Holocaust, not only in Lublin but all over Poland. Today his life story is a part of the curriculum which is learnt in the general education system in Poland. School newspapers tell about him and try to understand the meaning of the Holocaust through his short life story.  The Primer  \\"The Primer\\" (in Polish: Elementarz) permanent exhibition in Majdanek is exhibited in barrack 53, and it is dedicated to the children who were in the camp. This exhibition was created by Tomasz Pietrasiewicz, the director of The Grodzka Gate ‚Äì Theater NN Center. The purpose of this educational project is to demonstrate the fate of the children who were imprisoned in the death camp. The idea of the project was born when one of the survivors noticed that Majdanek Museum does not inform the visitors and does not show them the lives of the children in the camp. It was hard for pupils who visited Majdanek museum to identify themselves emotionally with the things which happened in Majdanek. Through this exhibition the Majdanek museum enables pupils to turn the knowledge which is learnt in school into real education that concerns what had happened in \\"The Camp World\\". The exhibition shows the fate of four children, ex-prisoners in Majdanek Camp: two Jewish children, Halina Birenbaum and Henio Zytomirski; a Belarusian child, Piotr Kiryszczenko; and a Polish girl, Janina Buczek. One of them was killed in the camp ‚Äì Henio Zytomirski. The exhibition presents in a symbolic way also a fifth fate which was likely the fate of Jewish girls in the camp. We learn this only from what was written on a slip of paper which was found in Majdanek, hidden in a girl's shoe: :\\"There was once El≈ºunia, :who was dying all alone, :In Majdanek was her father, :And in Auschwitz was her mum\\". The girl, El≈ºunia, who wrote the note was nine years old, and she was singing the song to herself to a melody of a famous Polish nursery rhyme (in Polish: \\"Z popielnika na Wojtusia iskiereczka mruga\\"). In the exhibition the visitors can hear both versions of the song. The exhibition is divided into two parts: \\"The Primer World\\" and \\"The Camp World\\". It is \\"The Primer\\" that teaches children how to organize and describe the world. It contains the simplest social categories that form the basis for relations between a human being and the world that surrounds him. A unique characteristic of \\"The Primer\\" lies in presenting a world without cruelty and evil. The children were \\"dragged out\\" from this simple and naive world of \\"The Primer\\" and forcibly thrown into the \\"Camp World\\". This world requires a completely different \\"Primer\\" ‚Äì the Death camp Primer. The \\"Camp World\\" that children were brought into was completely different from the world pictured in \\"The Primer\\". Camp life brought entirely new experiences, created new concepts for children such as: hunger, selection, gas chamber ‚Äì as well as daily contact with evil and death. Living in the camp caused distortion, deformed and destroyed the children's psyches. Along the walls of \\"The Primer World\\" there are pre-war primers in Polish, Belarusian and Hebrew. Four children's names are written in white chalk on the school board, those whose fates are presented in the exhibition. A hum of a school corridor is sounded in the room, and one can hear screams and pushing shouts of children during a school break. In \\"The Camp World\\" there is a symbolic \\"Camp Primer\\". The following words are described in it: appeal, barrack, gas chamber, crematorium, camp, selection, transport. Each word is expressed by the memories of survivors. To emphasize the importance of the strength of these terms, the terms were written and burned out on clay boards. The boards are put on concrete plates. All texts (written and spoken) presented in this part of the exhibition are memories of the prisoners. There are no comments, historic studies, etc. There are only testimonies of the witnesses. Four concrete water wells erected in the barrack symbolize the fate of each of the four children. The wells go through the floor down to the earth under the barrack. When one leans into the well, one can hear from the depths of the earth a story narrated by an adult about their stay in camp when they were children. The well commemorating Henio Zytomirski is silent‚Äì he did not survive the camp.  See also  * The Holocaust * Anne Frank * Lublin Ghetto  References   Further reading  * Kuwalek, Robert (2003).

The building of the castle was supervised by Benjamin Gummow, the Earl's architect and surveyor. It was used as a sporting lodge and, on occasions, for living accommodation. In 1886 the Chester firm of architects, Douglas and Fordham, added an extension in Elizabethan style for the 1st Duke of Westminster. The extension consisted of a wing containing a new drawing room. Internal alterations were made which included a staircase, and a chimneypiece in the dining room. Architecture The house is built in buff ashlar stone. Most of the windows are mullioned and transomed. Its more striking architectural features include castellated walls, towers, turrets, and many chimney stacks. Grounds Of the original grounds of Halkyn Castle there is still a grand but mainly informal garden and a small park dating from when the house was constructed. Walks have been laid out through an informal ornamental woodland, a small formal terraced garden and a small ornamental walled garden.

The tool has been developed by Bruno Blanchet. Support is provided for cryptographic primitives including: symmetric & asymmetric cryptography; digital signatures; hash functions; bit- commitment; and signature proofs of knowledge. The tool is capable of evaluating reachability properties, correspondence assertions and observational equivalence. These reasoning capabilities are particularly useful to the computer security domain since they permit the analysis of secrecy and authentication properties. Emerging properties such as privacy, traceability and verifiability can also be considered. Protocol analysis is considered with respect to an unbounded number of sessions and an unbounded message space. The tool is capable of attack reconstruction: when a property cannot be proved, an execution trace which falsifies the desired property is constructed. Applicability of ProVerif ProVerif has been used in the following case studies, which include the security analysis of actual network protocols: * Abadi & Blanchet used correspondence assertions to verify the certified email protocol. * Abadi, Blanchet & Fournet analyse the Just Fast Keying protocol, which was one of the candidates to replace Internet Key Exchange (IKE) as the key exchange protocol in IPsec, by combining manual proofs with ProVerif proofs of correspondence and equivalence. * Blanchet & Chaudhuri studied the integrity of the Plutus file system on untrusted storage, using correspondence assertions, resulting in the discovery, and subsequent fixing, of weaknesses in the initial system. * Bhargavan et al. use ProVerif to analyse cryptographic protocol implementations written in the F Sharp (programming language); in particular the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol has been studied in this manner. * Chen & Ryan have evaluated authentication protocols found in the Trusted Platform Module (TPM), a widely deployed hardware chip, and discovered vulnerabilities. * Delaune, Kremer & Ryan and Backes, Hritcu & Maffei formalise and analyse privacy properties for electronic voting using observational equivalence. * Delaune, Ryan & Smyth and Backes, Maffei & Unruh analyse the anonymity properties of the trusted computing scheme Direct Anonymous Attestation (DAA) using observational equivalence. * Kusters & Truderung examine protocols with Diffie-Hellman exponentiation and XOR. * Smyth, Ryan, Kremer & Kourjieh formalise and analyse verifiability properties for electronic voting using reachability. * Google verified its transport layer protocol ALTS.

Plot At Wonder Studios (\\"If it's a good picture, it's a Wonder\\"), producer I.M. Stupendous is interrupted in his office by Daffy asking for an acting position, and quickly responds \\"No!\\" and breaks the fourth wall by stating, \\"Y'know, that duck's screwy!\\" The phone rings and Daffy pops out of it saying \\"You're correct, absolutely correct!\\", pinching Stupendous's nose. Stupendous then phones Director von Hamburger (a parody of Josef von Sternberg) and orders him to finish the picture he's working on that day. On the set, all the crew rushes to follow Hamburger's order for a close-up, who starts smoking a cigarette. Daffy then swipes and starts smoking the cigarette, spelling out Warner Bros. with the smoke (\\"Just givin' my bosses a plug\\", he tells the audience. \\"I've got an option coming up!\\"). Hamburger asks how the sound is, and Daffy whistles into the microphone which gives a bad reaction to the crew member checking it. He orders the lights turned which Daffy has connected the emergency fire hose to, causing water to gush out of the lights and down on the set where the actors are. Hamburger quotes \\"It's ruined, cut!\\" Daffy then plants bullets in the camera. When the camera rolls on Hamburger's orders, it starts shooting bullets. Hamburger begins crying while stating \\"This isn't a gangster picture!\\" Daffy sympathetically gives him a gift, promising to stop being screwy, and walks away. However, Daffy then pops up out of the gift box, bites Hamburger's nose and starts jumping around. As filming begins, a typical romantic scene between a rooster and hen plays out. When the inevitable kiss comes up, Daffy jumps in and kisses the hen; he is so excited that he does it again. Hamburger declares \\"It's ruined, cut!\\" The time being noon, Hamburger asks for lunch: turkey with all the trimmings. However, Daffy is under the platter and bites Hamburger's nose again, then jumps away. Then, in the film room, Daffy begins clipping and pasting together random film clips. Hamburger tells Stupendous that his film is finished, Stupendous quotes \\"Well it better be good\\" as Daffy swaps out the films. Hamburger shows the \\"film\\". At first the title card reads \\"Gold Is Where You Find It\\" (a movie produced by Warner Bros. the same year), showing film clips of gold mining, but then suddenly plays humorous live action clips of random scenes with appropriate mismatched audio (a lion roaring in Central Park Zoo, a US military parade, square dancing, the World Championship Fight in Madison Round Garden, and a beauty contest). Despite Hamburger's obvious (and justified) fear, Stupendous approves highly of the film as he finds that Hamburger has fainted. As a result, Daffy is now the director, uttering the same line asking for turkey at lunchtime as Hamburger complete with Hamburger's accent and clothing. Hamburger is now the screwball, hiding under the platter, biting Daffy's nose, then jumping away as Daffy did earlier.

Background Ruane was a native of Carnmore, County Galway, and joined the Irish Republican Brotherhood in 1908. He was already an active sportsman with the GAA, his position being full-back. From 1910 to 1916 he captained the local hurling team. Easter 1916 During the Galway Easter Rising in 1916 he was Captain of the Claregalway men. They rendezvoused with the Castlegar man under Brian Molloy and Pat Callanan at Carnmore. Orders were received from Liam Mellows to proceed to the deserted Moyode Castle, in Oranmore. The volunteers were discovered while resting at Carnmore Cross by a group of Royal Irish Constabulary. Fighting broke out but the only casualty was a Constable Whelan, who was the first to die during the Rising. Arriving at Moyode they congregated with other companies but lack of orders and supplies led to fatigue and hunger. When news of the failure of the Rising in Dublin arrived, the men dispersed, some going home. Ruane himself went on the run. He hid out in Moycullen and used an island in Lough Corrib as a fall-back during searches. However, a letter was found in his wife's handbag which gave his address as at Bohans, Borra, Moycullen. He was arrested and sent to Frangoch, where he spent ten months. After his release, he was arrested in 1918 in connection with the German Plot, this time in Wormwood Scrubs and Winson Green. Military and civil activities After his release from Birmingham Prison he was appointed a justice of the Sinn F√©in courts for south and west Galway. His activities came at the price of a thousand-pound reward for his capture, and he was targeted by the Black and Tans. He may have participated on the attack on Loughgeorge R.I.C. Barracks in May 1920, launched by the mid-Galway Brigade. After the Treaty, he fought on the side of the Republicans. As a reprisal for the Kilroe ambush, near Headford, all his farm produce was burned. Later career Ruane was a member of the County Board and a chairman of the Galway District Council for seven years. He served as a Sinn F√©in member of the County Council and chairman of the Finance Committee. His son, Paddy Ruane, was elected to the council six times for Sinn F√©in while his other son, Stephen, was a member of Fianna F√°il. One of Ruane's grandson's was a British M.P. as of 2000. Ruane died on 31 August 1937, aged 53, and was buried in Claregalway cemetery.

Though they may be used against adults, almost all ABCs concern young people. The contract, drawn up and agreed upon by the agencies concerned in consultation with the individual, contains both negative and positive conditions, detailing respectively what behaviour the individual will cease to partake in and what activities the individual will pursue to change their behaviour. Though ABCs are not legally binding [this is untested in the courts as yet], breach of an ABC is often used as evidence to support an application for an Anti-Social Behaviour Order, breach of which is a criminal offence. In agreements, children are asked to not only sign that they will not perform the identified behaviour(s) but that they recognise that breach may result in application for an ASBO and that, if the ASBO is breached, they may face imprisonment of up to 5 years and/or a fine up to ¬£2,000. The process for an ABC will first be a letter, sent to parent(s) in the case of a minor, which will identify the existence of behaviour but not what specifically it consisted of, associate the person with the behaviour, and then 'invite' the person, and parent, to a meeting at which an ABC will be discussed. Failure to attend, it is often warned, may lead to sanctions, the most common being loss of local authority or social housing tenancy by the person or the parent(s). The use of these with such groups is more likely, therefore, than with those in private-rented or owned properties. There is little national data on the ways in which ABCs have been used in the UK. At least 19,000 have been rolled out, mainly with children aged 10‚Äì18 years. ABCs were first used in Islington in the early 2000s,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2001/aug/29/guardiansocietysupplement2 and rolled out nationwide in the following years. Little attention has been paid to the rights issues around ABCs (focus mainly having been on ASBOs). However, the children play campaign body, Fair Play for Children Association, after being contacted by a parent in Islington in 2002, published an article 'Easy as ABC?' which detailed 2 cases, and raised serious concerns about the children's rights and civil liberties aspects of these contracts. Fair Play surveyed local authorities subsequently and found a very wide range of practice, from virtual non-use onwards. Local authority solicitors seemed divided on the human rights aspect, some saying that use of ABCs had been considered against obligations under the Human Rights Act 1998, others that it had not. The legal status of ABCs has hardly been considered. The claim is made that they are not legally binding, a moot point, for why then are children warned their parents may lose tenancies? The question of coercion must arise. What is the human rights status of an ABC? The UK has incorporated the European Convention on Human Rights directly into its domestic law, The Human Rights Act 1998,.http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/42/contents The relevant Articles of the Convention may well be nos. 8 (respect for private and family life), 11 (freedom of peaceful assembly and to freedom of association with others), and 14 (secured without discrimination on any ground) but the principal Article against which use of ABCs might best be judged is Article 6.1: \\"In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law. Judgement shall be pronounced publicly by the press and public may be excluded from all or part of the trial in the interest of morals, public order or national security in a democratic society, where the interests of juveniles or the protection of the private life of the parties so require, or the extent strictly necessary in the opinion of the court in special circumstances where publicity would prejudice the interests of justice.\\" The question must arise, is the deployment of an ABC option a means of determining someone's civil obligations? The sending of a letter to a person, or parent, may be argued to be the first stage of such a process, the threat of sanctions where used must lend weight to such a view. If this view is correct then the process must also take account of the person's rights. The question arises as to whether ABC processes as generally described and used, comply with A6.1. Many local authority solicitors had not, in the above survey, considered A6.1 at all. The popularity of ABCs with government is that they are much easier to achieve than ASBOs and there is the aspect that they are for use as a means of avoiding involvement with the criminal law, especially per the young. However, that they have been signed by children as young as 11 not because the child recognised alleged wrongdoing but because of threat of loss of parent's tenancy, and that children have signed away a fundamental right of freedom of association, must raise concerns. In particular the lack of reference to the HRA 1998 and the need for an independent scrutiny of a case, is a serious matter. Not only do children especially need to understand why they are being asked to sign an ABC, but also their interests and rights cannot be subordinated to e.g. politically popular objectives or \\"easier\\" solutions to perceived problems of public order. Claims that ABCs prevent engagement with the criminal law may be countered with a view that other forms of informal intervention which do not involve coercion and also target identified individual behaviours have been given neither the support nor prominence of the ABC afforded by government. The lack of detailed study of ABCs renders the suspicion that they can be used as an 'easy option' to \\"sort out\\" neighbourhood problems with infringement of basic rights of those \\"accused\\". This does not say that ABCs have not been used to proper and good effect, but that their vague legal basis and possible misuse are matters for public concern especially as the most-targeted group are the young, under 18 years. If, as analysed, an ABC is a determination of civil obligations, damage is done to children's understanding of, and to, the Rule of Law as the basics of a fair and just society if the pre-requisites of the Rule of Law are flouted in obtaining a signed ABC.

The church belongs to Syro-Malabar Catholic Archdiocese of Thrissur. According to rough figures there are around 4,000 Christian families in the parish. Because of the huge presence of Christian people in Ollur, with its religious, educational, medical, social-service, and secular organisations and institution, Ollur has been called as Chinna Roma (Small Rome). The church is constructed on a hill-top which is the highest location in the area. The church is surrounded by a huge protective compound wall called Elephant Wall (Aana Mathil). When Thrissur Vicariate Apostolic was erected in 1887, Ollur was the richest, most populous, and influential parish, so much that the Vicar of the Ollur parish were included in Adolph Medlycott's four-member diocesan apex council. St. Anthony's Forane Church has 18 churches under its jurisdiction. History A 1938 photo of St. Anthony's Forane Church, Ollur, photo published in the Cochin Government Royal War Efforts Souvenir Previously, the Ollur Christian population went to Mass in Puzuvial church. One day one of the women of the Chiramel family missed Mass in Puzuvial church. Disappointed, she told this to her son and asked him to construct a church in Ollur. After this, land donated by Malaekal Karthakal was used for building a new church in Ollur. According to church records, in 1718 a temporary church was constructed and the first Mass was conducted. The church was blessed on 13 June 1722, by the Mar Antony Pimentel, Metropolitan and Gate of All India or known as Kodungallur Bishop with Johann Ernst Hanxleden famously known as Arnos Paathiri. In 1790, Tipu Sultan set fire to church but only the facade was burnt. In 1972, Mar Joseph Kundukulam, the first Archbishop of Thrissur, banned the Thullal (popularly known as devil dancing). Beatified people Euphrasia Eluvathingal, Maria Theresa Chiramel and Kuriakose Elias Chavara have visited and stayed in the church. India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru visited the church on 24 November 1951. Vicar Monsignor Paul Kakkassery welcomed Nehru by handing over a large candle lighted. Festivals Feast of Saint Raphael, Ollur, the Archangel, is the most important festival of Ollur church falling on 23 and 24 October of each year. The festival was started in 1837. Another festival is in honor of Saint Sebastian in the month of January and is the second major festival in the parish. Also, Ollur parish celebrates around 73 feasts and festivals in the calendar year. POPE PIUS XII GOLDEN JUBILEE MEMORIAL FA√áADE 3-4-1949 AN INSIDE ALTAR VIEW OF THE St. ANTHONY'S FORANE CHURCH.

Ponnumuthan, Aerath & Menachery An inside view of the St. Anthony's Forane Church, Ollur If there is any church in Kerala which can be compared with Sistine Chapel in the Vatican City, that is St. Anthony's Forane Church in Ollur. Every inch of space in the church is decorated, under both western and indigenous influences, with the highest achievements of the painter, the sculptor, the ceramics worker, the carpenter, the goldsmith, the bronze artisan, or the architect - using every media known or imaginable like gold, silver, iron, bronze, wood, ivory, stone - including laterite, granite, and precious stones. A unique feature of the church is the number and variety of the angel images in the church. There are more than five thousand images of angels in the church, in fresco, mural, wood, plaster, stone, metal and ivory. The paintings of the church cover an area of thousands of square feet and are considered one of the most beautiful ones in entire Kerala. Belfry The seven storey Belfry or Bell tower (125 feet) of the church is said to be the tallest structure in South India when it was constructed.For photos and details cf. Cf. St. Antony Octingenary Volume, Ed. George Menachery, 1996 The huge three bells in the bell tower were imported from Marseilles in France (1883‚Äì1892) in 19th century and is one of biggest bells in Kerala. The bells are inscribed with the pictures of Jesus, Saint Joseph, Mary (mother of Jesus), Saint Anthony, Raphael (archangel) and Tobias. Owned by Ollur church is written in the bells in Syriac language and Malayalam. Liberation struggle The plaque inside the St. Anthony's Forane Church for the memorial of Liberation Struggle In 1959 Catholics took to the streets of Kerala to protest against the first Communist Government in the state headed by E. M. S. Namboodiripad. This was known as Vimochana Samaram or Liberation Struggle. The confrontation was sparked by a state law that would have effectively taken over Catholic education facilities. In the same year, on 23 July, Kerala Police fired at the St. Anthony's Forane Church on the part of Liberation Struggle. A memorial had been erected at the church courtyard then. The memorial says, Communist Government fired bullets to the Church here. The struggle of 1959 had led to the dismissal of the first democratically elect Communist Government in the world.

Early history In the 1970s and early 1980s, the cost of making a phone call decreased and more business communication was done by phone. As corporations grew and labor rates increased, the ratio of secretaries to employees decreased. The initial solution to the phone communication problem for businesses was the ‚Äúmessage center.‚Äù A message center or ‚Äúmessage desk‚Äù was a centralized, manual answering service inside a company manned by a few people answering everyone‚Äôs phones. Extensions that were busy or rang ‚Äúno answer‚Äù would forward to the message center onto a device called a ‚Äúcall director‚Äù. The call director had a button for each extension in the company which would flash when that person‚Äôs extension forwarded to the message center. A little label next to the button told the operator whose extension it was. As wireless communication technologies increased in the late 1980s, the Pager service providers created a subscription service offered in a variety of plans and options to meet the needs of a subscriber and the type of device used. In general, all pagers are given unique telephone numbers so that callers could dial in and send a numeric message, such as their callback number or a numerically coded special message, such as room numbers to report to, etc. However, alphanumeric pagers could only receive text messages when the message sender had installed software on their PC to dial into the publicly accessible modems operated by the pagingUnsecured Text. medicalansweringservice.net; cited 27 May 2014 service provider to then transmit their message over-the-air through the network of radio towers.Call Center IVR example Message Center becomes Alpha-dispatch Alpha Dispatch service is best described as enhanced numeric paging.IDSC It is a service that consists of live operators who answer incoming calls and input the callers' messages on a computer, then transmit the message using the Telocator Alphanumeric Protocol to the paging provider's radio towers. Alphanumeric pagers receive the messages in the form of words and numbers. Messages are sequentially numbered and archived for later reference if required to be re-sent. PageNet was one of the larger paging providers who offered this service add-on to their alphanumeric pager customers. Difference between full Answering Service Alpha-dispatch was never designed to replace a full-service answering service. Although both services will answer calls in a customer's name and advise the caller that the customer is unavailable, a full-service answering service will usually have additional information about the customer that they are encouraged to share with the caller such as business summary, website information, personal schedule, and other informational details. An alpha-dispatch service operator usually has no knowledge of the subscriber, except for their first and last name or company name, and serves only as a messaging bridge between the caller and the subscriber with the caller dictating what the operator should type as a message to the subscriber. Because of this difference, minimal training and supervising is required of the call center employees and therefore operator messaging service is much less expensive than full-service answering services. The low cost makes operator messaging an affordable alternative to voicemail. Operator Messaging Extends to Text Messaging As the use of alphanumeric pagers declined in the mid-1990s and cell phone text messaging availability and reliability increased ever since, these well-established alpha-dispatch call centers adjusted their technology to allow live operators' messages to be transmitted to cellular service providers in the same way as to pager service providers. Operators still follow the same answering procedures and have no idea if the subscriber is receiving the text message on a cell phone or a pager. The operator still serves as a \\"relay\\" or \\"bridge\\" for the caller to dictate their message to the operator messaging subscriber's device. Rise of Operator Messaging in the 21st Century Although e-mail capabilities have been extended to alphanumeric pagers and cellular text messaging, the operator messaging services are used by individuals who are not located near a computer or where sending a text message may be dangerous or impractical. Live operator messaging marries the technologies of voice messaging and text messaging as an alternative to voicemail service by using call forwarding features to redirect callers of your cell phone automatically to the operator messaging service after three or four unanswered rings. Operator messaging service providers remain profitable because the average call length is under 30 seconds and employees are often paid less than full-service answering service employees due to the limited training required.

The term was created in 2003 by Scott Nicholson, Assistant Professor, Syracuse University School of Information Studies, in order to distinguish data mining in a library setting from other types of data mining. How bibliomining works First a data warehouse must be created. This is done by compiling information on the resources, such as titles and authors, subject headings, and descriptions of the collections. Then the demographic surrogate information is organized. Finally the library information (such as the librarian, whether or not the information came from the reference desk or circulation desk, and the location of the library) is obtained. Once this is organized, the data can be processed and analyzed. This can be done via a few methods, such as online analytical processing (OLAP), using a data mining program, or through data visualization. Uses of bibliomining Bibliomining is used to discover patterns in what people are reading and researching and allows librarians to target their community better. Bibliomining can also help library directors focus their budgets on resources that will be utilized. Another use is to determine when people use the library more often, so staffing needs can be adequately met. Combining bibliomining with other research techniques such as focus groups, surveys and cost-benefit analysis, will help librarians to get a better picture of their patrons and their needs. Issues There is some concern that data mining violates patron privacy. But by extracting the data, all personally identifiable information is deleted, and the data warehouse is clean. The original patron data can then be totally deleted and there will be no way to link the new data to a particular patron. This can be done in a few ways. One, used with information regarding database access, is to track the IP address, but then replace it with a similar code, that will allow identification without violating privacy. Another is to keep track of an item returned to the library and create a \\"demographic surrogate\\" of the patron. The demographic surrogate would not give any identifiable information such as names, library card numbers or addresses. The other concern in bibliomining is that it only provides data in a very detached manner. Information is given as to how a patron uses library resources, but there is no way to track if the resources met the user's needs completely. Someone could take out a book on a topic, but not find the information they were seeking. Bibliomining only helps identify which books are used, not how useful they actually were. Bibliomining cannot provide information on how well a collection serves a patron. In order to counteract this, bibliomining must be used in accordance with other research techniques.

She has exhibited extensively and realised numerous commissions nationally and internationally, in gallery spaces, museums and within the public realm. Hadzi-Vasileva was selected by the Ministry of Culture to represent Macedonia at the 55th Venice Biennale in 2013, with Ana Frangovska, curator at the National Gallery of Macedonia. Recent sites and commissions include Pied √† Terre, London; Gloucester Cathedral, Gloucester; Towner Gallery, Eastbourne; Southgate Shopping Centre, Bath; Swiss Embassy and the World Bank, Macedonia; Kilmainham Gaol Museum, Ireland; ArtSway at the 51st Venice Biennale in Italy and Public Room, Skopje. She graduated in Sculpture from the Royal College of Art, London, in 1998.  Work  Hadzi-Vasileva is a site specific installation artist who works across the varied media of sculpture, installation, video and sound, photography, and architectural interventions. This has included Ambush (2000), which was a temporary outdoor architectural intervention, where engineered tunnels were used to expose the roots of living trees with glazed roof areas allowing the visitors to see the world from below the ground, a project co-ordinated by Southern Arts, and hosted by ArtSway and the Forestry Commission. Central to Hadzi-Vasileva's practice is a response to the particularities of place: its history, locale, environment and/or communities. She often uses materials that already have an existing link or history to the specific environment, which often results in new and unusual methods of working. Past works have included the use of organic materials, foodstuffs (butter, fish skins, chicken skins, internal animal organs, rice, and watercress) and precious metals (gold, silver, copper).  Awards  Hadzi-Vasileva has been the recipient of many awards including the 2013 Alexandra Reinhardt Memorial Awards, to develop a new commission for mima, Middlesbrough and Engage, London. In 2010 she received an award of recognition for special achievements in the field of Fine Art for the development of the town of Kavadarci by the national Assembly of Kavadarci, Macedonia. She was also selected to represent Macedonia at the 55th Venice Biennale in 2013. She was recipient of the Pollock-Krasner Foundation award in 2002, was shortlisted for the Jerwood Sculpture Prize (2001), and Spitalfields Sculpture Prize (2010).

Published in a building at the corner of Columbus Avenue and East Water Street, the Clarion became a daily newspaper on April 24, 1848. The Clarion office burned down in January 1852, destroying almost all files. Rechristened the Daily Register, the paper continued to grow with its city, becoming a paper of Republican affiliation in 1856.Sandusky Clarion - Chronicling America.gov In 1859, the paper was renamed the Commercial Register. The name plate Sandusky Register first appeared in 1869. A charter member of the Western Associated Press, parent of the present Associated Press, the Register was one of the first newspapers able to supply, through radio dispatch, instant news. In 1929, the Sandusky Register purchased the Democratic-affiliated paper the Sandusky Star-Journal and moved to its present location at Jackson and Market Streets in Sandusky. Both the Register and the Star-Journal continued publication under the corporate name of Sandusky Newspapers Inc. In 1941, the company acquired the rival Sandusky News, and the name on all editions was changed to the Register Star-News. The paper resumed its original name Sandusky Register in 1958. Its website went live in 1996. The local entertainment website for Sandusky and the Lake Erie Islands Funcoast.com also went live in 1996. The Sandusky Register was purchased in 1869, by Isaac Foster \\"I.F.\\" Mack, an Oberlin College graduate and union soldier who was captured by the Confederacy and held as a Prisoner of War.

His article Glimpse into the future was considered the most important manifesto of Galician RussophilismJohn Paul Himka. (1999). Religion and Nationality in Western Ukraine, pp. 24-28. Montreal and Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press. Background During the 19th century the area currently known as western Ukraine was part of the Austrian Empire. Its people consisted primarily of Poles and Ukrainians. The Poles had ruled over western Ukraine prior to the Austrians having ruled over it, and made up most of the nobility. They dominated the region politically and economically. The Ukrainians, although a numeric majority, were mostly peasants or priests. During the nineteenth century the people who are now known as Ukrainians referred to themselves as Rusyny, typically translated as Ruthenians. Among the Ruthenians, two competing national ideologies developed: Russophilism, the belief that there was no such thing as a Ukrainian nation and that the people of western Ukraine were the westernmost branch of the Russian people, and Ukrainophilism, the belief that there was a Ukrainian nation separate from a Russian one and that the people of western Ukraine belonged to that Ukrainian nation. Although initially the Austrian authorities supported Russophilism as a counterbalance against the Poles, when Austria and Russia became rivals Austria shifted its support to the Ukrainophile movement. Biography Ivan Naumovich was born into a clerical family in western Ukraine, which was at the time part of the Austrian Empire; his father was a school teacher but his grandfather was a priest. Like many with his social background, the family spoke the Polish language at home while maintaining Ruthenian traditions.–ò.–ì. –ù–∞—É–º–æ–≤–∏—á –∫–∞–∫ –æ–±—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π, –ø–æ–ª–∏—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –∏ —Ä–µ–ª–∏–≥–∏–æ–∑–Ω—ã–π –¥–µ—è—Ç–µ–ª—å –ì–∞–ª–∏—á–∏–Ω—ã –≤—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–π –ø–æ–ª–æ–≤–∏–Ω—ã XIX –≤–µ–∫–∞ Nina Pashaeva, 2001. When Naumovich entered a Ukrainian Catholic seminary in Lviv in 1848, he became swept up into and joined the Polish revolutionary movementJean-Paul Himka. (1986). The Greek Catholic Church and Ukrainian Society in Austrian Galicia. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. and attempted to convince other Ukrainians to join the Polish cause. These efforts met with complete rejection from the Ukrainian peasants, causing Naumovich to turn away from the Poles. Naumovich married in 1851 and finished his studies that year, becoming a parish priest in Skalat.Paul R. Magocsi, The roots of Ukrainian nationalism: Galicia as Ukraine's Piedmont, Toronto, 2002 Initially Naumovich focused his efforts on attempting to rid the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church of various Roman Catholic rituals and practices that it had adopted during the centuries of Catholic Polish rule, a process referred to as purification, in order to reestablish the pure \\"Russian\\" character of the Church. Such actions earned him great popularity among the Ukrainian people, and he was elected to the Galician Diet in 1861 and the Austrian parliament in 1873. During this time he was a passionate defender of the rights of the Ruthenian people against the Polish landlords and supported the division of the province of Galicia into western (Polish) and Eastern (Ukrainian, which Naumovich considered to be Russian) parts. Naumovich also founded the Kachkovsky Society, the Russophile counterpart and rival to the pro-Ukrainian Prosvita, which involved creating pro-Russian reading rooms for Ruthenian peasants. The intensity of Naumovich's pro-Russian activities earned the distrust of the Austrian authorities and of the Catholic Church. A seemingly minor incident in 1881 led to his downfall. In that year, the 129 inhabitants of a small village demanded their own Ukrainian Catholic parish and church rather than to pay to support the building of a new church in a neighboring village that would serve both villages. When their petition for a new church in their own village was denied, the villagers voted to convert their village to Eastern Orthodoxy. This event caught the attention of the Vatican and of the Austrian authorities in Vienna, who feared that it portended the beginning of large-scale conversion to Orthodoxy and to a Russian orientation. An investigation proved that Ivan Naumovich, despite being a Greek Catholic priest, wrote the peasants' petition requesting conversion to Orthodoxy.John Paul Himka. (1999). Religion and Nationality in Western Ukraine, pg. 75. Montreal and Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press. In 1882 Naumovich was arrested for treason. Acquitted of that charge, he was instead convicted of disturbing public order and spent eight months in prison. In 1885 he was excommunicated from the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. Naumovich converted to Russian Orthodoxy and settled in Kiev, then part of the Russian Empire, before becoming a parish priest in a village outside Kiev. Naumovich died in 1891 in Novorossiysk. Writings and Ideas In 1866 the Austrian Empire was defeated in the Austro- Prussian War and central authorities found themselves weakened. Representative of various nationalities took advantage of this weakness to agitate for demands for more power the central authorities. Unlike their Polish rivals in eastern Galicia, Ukrainian community leaders made no demands, instead declaring their strong loyalty to the Habsburgs and hoped that this loyalty would be rewarded. However, in order to appease the restless Poles, the Austrian authorities gave in to many of their demands. The demands included greater Polish control over lands at the expense of the Ukrainian rivals, who had declared their loyalty to Austria. A Glimpse into the Future, anonymously written by Naumovich and signed as \\"One in the Name of Many\\", was a response to these events. It would become the main manifesto of the Russophile movement in western Ukraine. The manifesto had two parts. The first part was an attack on the traditional Ukrainian policy of unconditional loyalty to the Habsburgs. He identified the fact that \\"our kindheartedness and tact\\" towards the Austrian Emperor at the time of his defeat was less effective than the agitation of the Polish enemies. He contrasted the weak behaviors of Ukrainians with that of Serbs and Romanians within the Empire and proclaimed that if Ukrainian policies were to continue all Ukrainians would eventually become Polonized. This view of the situation eventually came to be accepted by most elements of Ukrainian society, even those (such as the Ukrainophiles) that did not follow Naumovich to the conclusion he drew in the second part of his article. In the second part of A Glimpse into the Future, Naumovich concluded that the failure of Ukrainian leaders could be traced to their efforts to create a new western Ruthenian nation. He claimed that such efforts were in vain, and that from the perspective of ethnography, language, literature and ritual the people of Galicia, Kiev, Moscow, Tobolsk, etc. were all one Russian people. According to Naumovich, only by uniting with other Russians would Galician Ruthenians be able to maintain their East Slavic culture and Eastern Slavic religion and traditions. He proposed that Standard Russian should be adopted as the literary language among Ruthenians. He did not explicitly call for a detachment of eastern Galicia to Russia (perhaps in order to assuage the Austrian censors) but mentioned the case of Italian- populated regions of Switzerland which chose to remain in Switzerland rather than join Italy because they were \\"happy in Switzerland.\\" Naumovich noted that, in contrast, Ruthenians were \\"not necessarily happy.\\" The publication of A Glimpse into the Future caused a response not only in the Austrian but also in the German, French and Russian presses. Like other Galician Russophiles, Ivan Naumovich claimed a special place for the Ukrainian people within the Russian nation. He declared that the Russian language was derived from \\"Little Russian\\" and was only being readopted, and that the modern Russian language had been created in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries by scholars from Ukraine.Timothy Snyder.

It is located 30 metres to the east of the Houghton Highway (which provides the northbound lanes), providing 3 southbound traffic lanes and a bi-directional pedestrian and bicycle path. It connects the Redcliffe suburb of Clontarf with the Brisbane suburb of Brighton, and was opened by then Queensland Premier Anna Bligh on 11 July 2010. The Ted Smout Memorial Bridge (and the adjacent Houghton bridge) were Australia's second longest bridges until 27 March 2013, when the Macleay River Bridge opened in Kempsey, NSW. The bridge consists of 78 spans, each 35 m long. The cost of the bridge was A$315 million. It was built 4 m higher than the Houghton bridge, in order to improve its resilience to storm surges. It is the first bridge in Australia designed to withstand Hurricane Katrina-type cyclonic events. It is also possibly the only Australian bridge which may have to deal with shallow water storm surge. The bridge features * 3 traffic lanes (originally 2 for regular traffic and a T2 (bus, taxi and vehicles with more than 2 occupants) lane, but the T2 lane has now been converted to a regular lane). * A wide pedestrian and cycle path that connects footpath and cycle networks on either side of Bramble Bay. The path is separated from traffic by a concrete barrier. * A fishing platform near the Pine River channel. The platform measures 10 m by 50 m. Naming The bridge is named 'Ted Smout Memorial Bridge' after Ted Smout, Queensland‚Äôs last surviving World War One veteran, who lived in Sandgate and died in 2004. The naming ceremony by Craig Wallace, the then Queensland Minister for Main Roads, took place on 14 July 2009 as part of Queensland‚Äôs 150th birthday celebrations. The ceremony also marked the construction of the middle (39th) span of the new bridge. History Construction of bridge in November 2008 View of new bridge from Clontarf shore The Houghton Highway bridge was originally built to duplicate the Hornibrook Bridge. However, the refurbishment of the original bridge proved to be uneconomic, and the Houghton bridge was converted to 3 lanes with peak flow lane control. When this reached capacity, another 3 lane bridge was proposed to be built between the Hornibrook and Houghton bridges, at the same height as the latter. After the original design was finalised, bridges of similar design were extensively damaged by storm surges caused by Hurricane Katrina, and it was necessary to redesign the bridge to be storm-surge resilient, involving raising the deck level by 4 metres. The revised design is distinctly different from the original plan, which was for a similar structure to the Houghton bridge. Its location was shifted to the east side of the Houghton bridge in order to provide it with some level of storm surge protection Increases in the cost of construction materials and labour, changes to the scope of the project following technical investigations and community consultation, extra costs associated with the removal of the Hornibrook bridge, as well as design improvements spurred by the events of Hurricane Katrina meant the total cost increased to $315 million, compared with the $149 million estimated in 2004. The preliminary design went on display in June 2007. A falsework platform was used and continually relocated as construction of the bridge segments progressed. Foundation piles were driven up to 39 metres into the sea bed, which were then reinforced with concrete and capped with concrete headstock and girders. The bridge was then fitted with concrete barriers, guard rails and electrical conduit. The southern and northern abutment of the bridge included land reclamation works involving a seawall and embankment. Construction began in April 2008 and the entire duplication works were completed on 19 August 2011.

He was born in Bergen as a son of shipbuilder and works owner Georg Christian Smitt and Marie Cathrine Wolff. His father was a half-brother (different mother) of Jonas, Livius and Jakob Sverdrup Smitt. Smitt graduated from the Norwegian College of Agriculture in 1909. He worked as the county forester of Rogaland from 1914 to 1923, and at the research institution Vestlandets forstlige fors√∏ksstasjon from 1923 to 1928. From 1 January 1928 to 31 December 1956 he served as its general director. As general director of the institute, Smitt was influential on the practice of large-scale forest planting in Western Norway, Central Norway and Northern Norway. He travelled extensively abroad, to study methods and ways to plant forest in the somewhat rough climate in these parts of Norway. Among others he found the North American species Picea sitchensis to be suitable for Norway, during a study trip in 1916 and 1917. The biographical dictionary Norsk biografisk leksikon referred to this forest planting as a \\"national task on the highest level\\". Anton Elias Smitt died in 1970.

During the 1920 season, a group of local investors tried to purchase the Ex-Collegians, however Lindsey refused to give up the team, due to differences between the players and the investors.

KNIME integrates various components for machine learning and data mining through its modular data pipelining concept. A graphical user interface and use of JDBC allows assembly of nodes blending different data sources, including preprocessing (ETL: Extraction, Transformation, Loading), for modeling, data analysis and visualization without, or with only minimal, programming. Since 2006, KNIME has been used in pharmaceutical research, it also used in other areas like CRM customer data analysis, business intelligence, text mining and financial data analysis. KNIME's headquarters are based in Zurich, with additional offices in Konstanz, Berlin, and Austin (USA). History The Development of KNIME was started January 2004 by a team of software engineers at University of Konstanz as a proprietary product. The original developer team headed by Michael Berthold came from a company in Silicon Valley providing software for the pharmaceutical industry. The initial goal was to create a modular, highly scalable and open data processing platform which allowed for the easy integration of different data loading, processing, transformation, analysis and visual exploration modules without the focus on any particular application area. The platform was intended to be a collaboration and research platform and should also serve as an integration platform for various other data analysis projects. In 2006 the first version of KNIME was released and several pharmaceutical companies started using KNIME and a number of life science software vendors began integrating their tools into KNIME.Tripos, Inc. Schr√∂dinger ChemAxon NovaMechanics Ltd.Treweren Consultants Later that year, after an article in the German magazine c't,Datenbank-Mosaik Data Mining oder die Kunst, sich aus Millionen Datens√§tzen ein Bild zu machen, c't 20/2006, S. 164ff, Heise Verlag. users from a number of other areasForum auf der KNIME Webseite joined ship. As of 2012, KNIME is in use by over 15,000 actual users (i.e. not counting downloads but users regularly retrieving updates when they become available) not only in the life sciences but also at banks, publishers, car manufacturer, telcos, consulting firms, and various other industries but also at a large number of research groups worldwide. Latest updates to KNIME Server and KNIME Big Data Extensions, provide support for Apache Spark 2.3, Parquet and HDFS-type storage. For the sixth year in a row, KNIME has been placed as a leader for Data Science and Machine Learning Platforms in Gartner's Magic Quadrant. right Internals KNIME allows users to visually create data flows (or pipelines), selectively execute some or all analysis steps, and later inspect the results, models, using interactive widgets and views. KNIME is written in Java and based on Eclipse. It makes use of extension mechanism to add plugins providing additional functionality. The core version already includes hundreds of modules for data integration (file I/O, database nodes supporting all common database management systems through JDBC or native connectors: SQLite, MS-Access, SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, Vertica and H2), data transformation (filter, converter, splitter, combiner, joiner) as well as the commonly used methods of statistics, data mining, analysis and text analytics. Visualization supports with the free Report Designer extension. KNIME workflows can be used as data sets to create report templates that can be exported to document formats like doc, ppt, xls, pdf and others. Other capabilities of KNIME are: * KNIMEs core-architecture allows processing of large data volumes that are only limited by the available hard disk space (not limited to the available RAM). E.g. KNIME allows analysis of 300 million customer addresses, 20 million cell images and 10 million molecular structures. * Additional plugins allows the integration of methods for text mining, Image mining, as well as time series analysis and network. * KNIME integrates various other open-source projects, e.g. machine learning algorithms from Weka, H2O.ai, Keras, Spark, the R project and LIBSVM; but also plotly, JFreeChart, ImageJ, and the Chemistry Development Kit. KNIME is implemented in Java but also allows for wrappers calling other code in addition to providing nodes that allow to run Java, Python, R, Ruby and other code fragments.

It is the 110th episode overall. The episode was written by executive producers Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz and directed by actor Mario Van Peebles. The episode is centered on Benjamin Linus. In 2007, Benjamin Linus (Michael Emerson) is forced by Ilana Verdansky (Zuleikha Robinson) to dig his own grave as a consequence of an uncovered lie. Meanwhile, Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) attempts to convince Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell) that they have a purpose. In the \\"flash-sideways\\", Ben copes with internal matters in his workplace. Plot 2004 (flash-sideways timeline) Dr. Benjamin Linus (Michael Emerson) is a history teacher at a high school. One day in the teachers' lounge, he has a particularly loud conversation with fellow teacher, Leslie Arzt (Daniel Roebuck), in which they complain about the lack of funding at the school, especially since Principal Reynolds (William Atherton) has made Ben watch over the kids in detention, instead of chaperoning the school's history club. John Locke (Terry O'Quinn), a substitute teacher, suggests that Ben become principal instead. While tutoring his star pupil, Alex Rousseau (Tania Raymonde), Ben learns that the principal is having an affair with the school nurse. Ben enlists Arzt's help in hacking the nurse's email account and tries to blackmail the principal with this information and take his job. However, Reynolds says that he will write a negative letter of recommendation for Alex's college application if Ben makes good on his threats. Ben, unwilling to sacrifice Alex's future, backs down. He does, though, use his new leverage with the principal to get out of covering detention and restart the history club. Ben is also seen at home caring for his sick father (Jon Gries), who says he wishes he and Ben had never left the Island and the Dharma Initiative. 2007 (original timeline) Following the events of the previous episode, \\"Sundown\\", Ben, Ilana (Zuleikha Robinson), Miles Straume (Ken Leung), Sun Kwon (Yunjin Kim) and Frank Lapidus (Jeff Fahey) flee from the temple, after the devastating attack by the Man in Black (also O'Quinn). Ilana discovers that Ben killed Jacob, after Miles examines Jacob's ashes using his ability to read the last thoughts of human remains. After the group travels back to the original survivors' beach camp, Ilana ties Ben up and forces him to dig his own grave, so that she can exact revenge as Jacob was, according to her, a father figure to her. The Man in Black arrives and attempts to recruit Ben, stating that he wants Ben to take over the Island once the Man in Black leaves with his followers. He frees Ben and tells him of a rifle standing against a tree about 200 yards in the jungle. As Ilana is trying to recapture him, Ben finds the rifle and gets the drop on her. But Ben only wishes to explain why he killed Jacob; he was afraid of losing his leadership position on the Island and felt rejected by Jacob, was angry because he chose the island over his daughter's life and was unable to forgive himself for letting her die. Ilana allows Ben to rejoin their group. Following the events of the episode \\"Lighthouse\\", Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) and Hugo \\"Hurley\\" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) agree to return to the temple. Hurley attempts to stall Jack, as Jacob had warned him of the attack at the temple. But they come across Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell), who leads them to the grounded 18th century slave ship, Black Rock. Richard has become suicidal since Jacob's death because he believes that his life on the Island has been meaningless. He attempts to kill himself using dynamite. Jack even helps, knowing the Island won't let him. When the dynamite fuse goes out, Jack convinces him that they are on the Island for a reason; they do have a purpose. They travel back to the beach and reunite with Ilana's group. Meanwhile, Miles has dug up some of the diamonds from Nikki and Paulo's grave. During the reunion, Charles Widmore (Alan Dale) is shown to arrive near the island in a submarine. Reception Critics favourably received the character development of Ben Linus (Michael Emerson, pictured). The episode received critical acclaim from critics. Review aggregate website Metacritic gave the episode a score of 92 out of 100, indicating \\"Universal Acclaim\\". The score was up on the previous week's score of 82, and is the best reviewed episode out of the first seven.Dietz, Jason (March 10, 2010), \\"Episode Review: Last Night's Lost, Season 6, Ep. 7: 'Dr. Linus'\\", Metacritic. Steven Kurutz of The Wall Street Journal deemed it the best episode of the season, containing \\"the perfect mix of action, drama and mysteries revealed.\\" Kurutz felt that Ben's storyline in the alternate universe was \\"so much tighter\\" than the other characters' presented in previous episodes, and that it was \\"heartening\\" rather than \\"hokey\\" to see Ben join the other characters on the beach at the end. Alan Sepinwall of The Star- Ledger deemed \\"Dr. Linus\\" \\"easily the most compelling episode of this final season so far,\\" enjoying even the scenes involving Jack, despite his \\"pathological hatred\\" of the character. Zap2it's Ryan McGee named the episode his second favorite of the season, kept only from superseding \\"The Substitute\\" by the overuse of Arzt. Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune called it \\"a tautly constructed and thus very satisfying episode of TV\\", deeming Emerson's performance \\"awe-inspiring\\" and the storylines \\"heartbreaking\\". She agreed with Kurutz's assessment of the alternate universe storylines, writing that \\"Dr. Linus\\" did \\"the best job yet\\" of linking the themes from both timelines together. Emily VanDerWerff of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the episode was the best since \\"The Constant\\", and also approved of the alternate timeline, feeling that it \\"takes the basic components of Ben's fall from grace on the Island and uses them in a new fashion, reinventing not just the story of how he became who he was but also the story of who he is at his core.\\" Noel Murray of The A.V. Club described the episode as having a \\"strong finish\\" but \\"very shaky start\\". He found the resolution of Ben's blackmail plot implausible and the subtext excessive, commenting: \\"every scene and line in this episode seemed designed to make sure that we got the point about the cruelty of fate, the burden of power, and so on and so on.\\" Murray enjoyed the episode's \\"poignant and tense\\" final minutes, however, and rated the episode \\"B-\\" overall, later rethinking his grade and changing it to a \\"B\\". BuddyTV's John Kubicek was similarly critical of the episode's subtext, and commented on his growing frustration with the alternate universe: \\"If the point is to show us how the Island made everyone a more interesting person, we get it, so please stop before we have to watch another watered-down character wuss out.\\" Kubicek also criticized the episode's ending, describing the scene shot through the submarine's periscope as \\"one of the most ridiculous things Lost has ever done.\\" References External links *\\"Dr. Linus\\" at ABC * * Category:Lost (season 6) episodes Category:2010 American television episodes ","title":"Dr. Linus"},{"id":"24960717","text":"Plat () is a dispersed settlement in the hills southeast of Me≈æica in the Carinthia region in northern Slovenia.Me≈æica municipal site The local church is dedicated to Saint Leonard and belongs to the Parish of Me≈æica.

Life Marie Pasteur was one of the daughters of the Rector of the Strasbourg Academy. She married in Strasbourg 29 May 1849, aged 23, to Louis Pasteur, aged 26. Marie worked as a secretary and science writer to her spouse and served as his amanuensis. She was his active assistant in his scientific experiments. She worked with him on expanding his first researches, around 1848, on the remarks previously made by Mitscherlich on the different optical properties concerning polarized light of tartaric acid when it came from natural wines, wine lees and when it was synthesized in a laboratory. The students and colleagues of Louis Pasteur acknowledged the importance she had for him in his work as his assistant. She grew the silkworms he needed for his experiment with their diseases, and she took care of the children he tried his famous experimental treatment on. She moved with him to his quarters at the Pasteur institute, and continued to live there after his death. It seems that for years afterward, famous crystallographer, physicist and mathematician Jean Baptiste Biot, Madame Marie Pasteur and Louis' father, Jean Joseph cooperated in providing Louis with moral support. For instance, in a letter by Biot to Louis father: \\"your son is ours also and we share with Marie all our love for him, too\\". There was also philosopher Charles Chappuis in this support network around Louis. Their eldest daughter, Jeanne, died from typhoid fever, aged 9, at Arbois. Then, in 1865, 2-year-old Camille also died of typhus, followed by 12-and-a-half-year-old C√©cile on 23 May 1866. Only Jean Baptiste and Marie Louise lived to be adults. Jean Baptiste would be a soldier in the Franco- Prussian War between France and Prussia. Marie Pasteur was buried in the crypt of the Institute Pasteur.

She was known as \\"The First Lady of Firsts\\", and helped create opportunities for women in aviation, auto racing, astronautics, and advertising. Early years She was born Betty Skelton in Pensacola, Florida on June 28, 1926. Her parents were teenagers and she was their only child. As a toddler, she was fascinated by the airplanes that flew over her home near the Naval Air Station and preferred model airplanes over dolls. When she turned eight, she started reading books on aviation and made her parents realize that she was serious about flying. Whenever they could, the family spent time at the municipal airport. She would talk pilots into letting her ride on local flights. Kenneth Wright, a Navy ensign, took a special interest in the Skeltons and provided instruction to Betty and her parents. He allowed her to solo in his Taylorcraft airplane when she was 12 years old, which was not permitted. After receiving her Civil Aviation Authority private pilot's license at age 16, she qualified for the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP) program, but the minimum age was 18¬Ω, so she was forced to wait. WASP participants ferried Air Force pilots and aircraft to their duty stations, and it was the only flying program that accepted women. However, it was discontinued four months before Skelton reached the required age.Watjen, Connie: AutoPilot Magazine, February/March 2008, \\"Betty Skelton Frankman Erde\\" While she was a teenager, Skelton flew whenever she could. She graduated from high school in 1944 and wanted a career in aviation, so she claimed to be 18 to get a job with Eastern Airlines as a clerk, Monash University website, Hargrave the Pioneers-Betty Skelton working at night. The job allowed her to rent planes and fly during the day. She earned ratings for single and multiengine on land and sea. At age 18, she received her commercial pilot licence and was certified as a flight instructor the following year, so she began teaching at Tampa's Peter O. Knight Airport. She joined the Civil Air Patrol a few years after it was formed in 1941. Women in Aviation International, 1997 Pioneer Hall of Fame, Betty Erde Aerobaticshttps://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/skelton- betty-pitts-s-1c-special-photograph Little Stinker in the Smithsonian Skelton's father, David, organized an amateur airshow in 1945 to raise funds for the local Jaycees. The airport manager in Tampa suggested that Skelton perform some basic stunts, but she had never done aerobatics. She borrowed a Fairchild PT-19 and Clem Whitteneck, a famous aerobatic pilot from the 1930s, taught her to loop and roll. Within two weeks, she had honed her skills and mastered simple aerobatic maneuvers, which she repeated for the air show. Because neither the military nor commercial airlines would accept a female pilot, air shows provided the only opportunity for her to work as a pilot, other than instructing. In 1946, she purchased a 1929 Great Lakes 2T-1A Sport Trainer biplane and performed at the Southeastern Air Exposition, held in Jacksonville, Florida. That was the start of her professional aerobatic career, and also that of the Blue Angels, a new US Navy precision-flying exhibition team. Skelton's repertoire included dozens of acrobatic tricks, but her most impressive maneuver involved cutting a ribbon strung between two fishing poles with her propeller, while flying upside down off the ground. She held the rank of major in the CAP and became a test pilot. Besides piston- driven airplanes, she also flew blimps, gliders, helicopters, and jets. S-1S After winning the championship in 1948, she bought a rare Pitts Special ‚Äî a lightweight, open-cockpit () biplane designed and hand built by Curtis Pitts for aerobatics. The plane was repainted a dramatic red and white, and Skelton's Chihuahua, Little Tinker, outfitted with a custom-made working parachute, flew in her lap. Skelton was US Female Aerobatic Champion in 1948, 1949, and 1950. Her last two championships made her and her plane, Little Stinker, famous. After her third championship, she was frustrated because no other challenges existed in aerobatics, and she was mentally and physically exhausted from the hectic, nonstop air-show circuit. She retired from aerobatics and sold the plane in 1951, but her first husband Don Frankman and she reacquired the airplane and donated it to the Smithsonian in 1985. Little Stinker is now on inverted display at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center at Washington Dulles International Airport, part of the National Air and Space Museum. In 1949, she set the world light-plane altitude record of in a Piper Cub. Two years later, she broke her own altitude record with a flight of , also in a Piper Cub. National Aviation Hall of Fame, Enshrinee list-Betty Skelton Frankman She held the world speed record for piston-engined aircraft: over a 3-km course in a P-51 Mustang racing plane. She became hostess of Van Wilson's Greeting Time, a radio show in 1950. Land racing Skelton moved to Raleigh, North Carolina, in 1951 and piloted charter flights. In 1953, the founder of NASCAR asked her to fly some auto racers from Pennsylvania to North Carolina. A friend, Bill France Sr., invited her to Daytona Beach, Florida, during speed week in February 1954. There, she drove the pace car at Daytona, then climbed into a Dodge sedan and was clocked at on the beach sand, setting a stock-car speed record for women. Skelton had discovered her second passion. She was granted an Automobile Association of America auto race driver's license, as the first woman with that distinction. She became the first female test driver in the auto industry in 1954 with Chrysler's Dodge division. She drove the jump boat, L‚Äôil Miss Dodge, in a movie stunt above a 1955 Custom Royal Lancer at Cypress Gardens in Florida. During that time, she also tried skydiving. Women Fly Resource Center, Acrobatic women pilots The National Aviation Hall of Fame reports, \\"Betty earned a total of four Feminine World Land Speed Records and set a transcontinental speed record.\\" She competed in races across the Andes mountains in South America and drove the length of the Baja Peninsula in Mexico. She set records at the Chelsea Proving Grounds and was the first woman to drive a jet car over at the Bonneville Salt Flats. She also set three women's land speed records at the Daytona Beach Road Course,Florida Photographic Collection information, Retrieved April 2, 2007 the last one being in 1956. That same year, she broke Cannonball Baker's 40-year record for the Transcontinental Auto Race from New York to Los Angeles. GM In 1956, she became an advertising executive with Campbell- Ewald and worked with General Motors on and in their TV and print ads. She was GM's first woman technical narrator at major auto shows, where she would talk about and demonstrate automobile features, later becoming official spokeswoman for Chevrolet. While Skelton was working with Chevrolet, she set numerous records with Corvettes, and owned a total of 10 models.Lush, Tamara: Associated Press, August 13, 2008, \\"What a ride: Woman, 82, inducted into Hall of Fame\\" Between 1956 and 1957, Harley Earl and Bill Mitchell designed a special, translucent gold Corvette for her, which she drove to Daytona in 1957 to serve as the NASCAR pace car. She helped launch Corvette News, the company's internal employee magazine, and served as its editor for many years. The publication is now known as Corvette Quarterly. She became vice president of Campbell-Ewald's new Women's Market and Advertising department in 1969, then retired in 1976 after 20 years in advertising. Astronautics In 1959, Skelton was the first woman to undergo NASA's physical and psychological tests, identical to those given to the Mercury Seven astronauts. NASA administered the tests at the request of Look for an article. She met and charmed the astronauts with her personality, then impressed them with her pilot skills. They nicknamed her \\"7¬Ω\\", and she was featured on the February 2, 1960 cover of Look. The United States Navy even awarded her honorary wings. However, nothing changed. \\"I complained that NASA wasn't giving more thought to women pilots... I wanted very much to fly in the Navy... But all they would do is laugh when I asked.\\" Personal life Skelton married Hollywood TV director/producer and Navy veteran Donald A. Frankman in 1965. They moved to Florida in 1976, where she kept a seaplane docked at their lakefront home in Winter Haven.Steindorf, Sara: Christian Science Monitor, December 9, 1999, \\"Daredevil Betty Skelton\\" She became a real estate agent in 1977 and published her book, Little Stinker. At the end of the century, Skelton was taking care of her ailing husband, who died in 2001, and she flew less often. \\"I just felt I wasn't as safe as I used to be,\\" she said. In 2005, she married Dr. Allan Erde, a retired naval surgeon, and they resided in The Villages, Florida. Both in their 80s, they lived in a retirement community where most residents used golf carts for transportation. Skelton drove a Corvette convertible with a color that nearly matched her red hair. She died on August 31, 2011.

Its reason to be was the existing conflict between the counts of Emp√∫ries - who ruled over most of the area around the town - and the counts of Barcelona, the most powerful of Catalonia at that time, who also had great power over the Mediterranean. In order to control the moves of the counts of Empuri√©s, the court of Barcelona commanded Bernat de Llabi√†, the governor of the Royal town of Torroella de Montgr√≠, to supervise the building of a fortress on top of the Montgr√≠ mountain. Work started in 1294 but the fortress was never completed as is obvious today. After those days, the fortress has lost its strategic value but has instead become a symbol of the region. Structure The fortress' style is one of the Middle Eastern fortresses that became popular in Europe after the Crusades. They featured a regular plan with cylindrical towers attached within the walls. The only parts erected were the perimeter walls, forming a square of 31m along each side, and the four round towers at its corners. The walls are 13m high with battlements along the top. The interior of the enclosure was laid out around a square, stone-paved central courtyard. Underneath this, there remains a large cistern for collecting rainwater. Around the courtyard, four wings of auxiliary buildings were planned out but never built. However the interior surfaces of the wall retain certain elements (toothing stones and springings for arches and vaults) which enable us to visualize the structure that these buildings were to have. Outside the castle, the former quarries can be seen, as well as the remains of a wall in the south face and a large cistern on the northern slope of the mountains.

The Forum, together with Ericsson, the World Meteorological Organization, National Meteorological Services (NMSs), the Earth Institute at Columbia University, as well as Zain and other mobile phone operators aim to deploy up to 5,000 automatic weather stations (AWSs) at wireless network sites across Africa, where less than 300 are reporting today. Background Climate change alters weather patterns and causes an increased number of extreme weather events, impacting heavily on the world‚Äôs poorest and most vulnerable communities. A recent Global Humanitarian Forum report estimated that climate change is responsible for some 300,000 deaths each year and over 100 billion US dollars worth of economic losses, mainly because of shocks to health and agricultural productivity. Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for close to a quarter of these losses, and is the region at the most immediate risk of droughts and floods. Agricultural yields in some areas are expected to fall by 50% as early as 2020. Adding to the fact that Africa is the continent worst affected by climate change, it also has the weakest weather monitoring system with only one-eighth of the WMO required weather monitoring density, and less than 300 weather stations that meet WMO observation requirements. NMSs across Africa therefore do not have the necessary means to deliver accurate and timely weather forecasts to end-users, when adequate, environmental information and services can play a crucial role in improving their lives and livelihoods and can contribute to sustaining economic growth, as well as to mitigating natural disasters. As climate change renders traditional knowledge unreliable, the lack of accurate weather forecasts prevents farmers from making informed decisions, such as when to seed and harvest their crops. Fishermen are also at risk with each year some 5‚Äô000 people‚Äôs lives being claimed on Lake Victoria alone due to storms and accidents. Accurate weather information is also crucial to understand and take action against the spread of climate-sensitive diseases, as well as for development planning purposes and for expanding access to insurance. The Weather Information Gap Annual Global Monitoring 1-15/10/2008 SYNOP reports made at 00,06,12 and 18 UTC at RBSN stations The initiative Through the reinforcement of the capacities of the NMSs, the Initiative is a practical solution for adaptation to climate change. It aims at enabling them to deliver more accurate weather forecasts and early warnings to communities throughout Africa as well as to develop new services adapted to various user groups such as farmers, health workers, or government agencies. Harnessing on the opportunities brought by the development of mobile communication in Africa, partners to the Initiative will install up to 5,000 AWSs at new and existing wireless network sites throughout Africa and reinforce the capacities of the NMSs to generate accurate weather forecasts and early warnings. The data collected by these stations will be analyzed by NMSs and transformed into sector-specific weather forecasts and early warnings distributed to end-users who need it most ‚Äì farmers, fishermen, rural, and urban communities via a suitable telecoms bearer, for example, SMS. Key Outcomes ‚ÄúThis initiative may prove to be one of the most important for African meteorology in decades.‚Äù Michel Jarraud, Secretary General, World Meteorological Organisation Better weather monitoring and forecasting capacities of NMSs and increased delivery channels to those who need them most will contribute to saving lives and livelihoods and boosting development progress in a variety of ways: * Reinforcement of NMSs capacities and capabilities: Installation of AWSs will reinforce the existing observation network and NMSs capacities to allow for the development of improved weather services and the delivery of accurate and adequate weather information to end-users. * Adaptation to climate change: Accurate information about changing weather patterns assists communities to adapt to the consequences of climatic change. * Agriculture: Accurate weather information leads to improved agricultural planning and decision-making. * Development planning: A better understanding of local climate conditions enables better planning and implementation of development strategies. * Disaster risk reduction: More accurate weather information and early warnings allow for better preparedness to severe weather events, reducing their socio- economic cost. * Health: Weather forecasts allow for the implementation of preventive measures against climate-sensitive diseases and epidemics, such as malaria, cholera, and dengue fever. * Insurance: Greater and more accurate weather information provides the basis for weather-index insurances, and allows for the expansion of insurance policies to farmers through micro- insurance schemes. * Finance: Farmers whose crops are insured through weather index policies have greater possibilities for accessing finance, which can help farmers increase crop yields and incomes. Automatic Weather Stations (AWS) AWSs use sensors to take measurements of a variety of meteorological parameters. Those deployed for the Initiative conform to WMO specifications. These units are robust and able to withstand various environmental conditions, yet are economical to operate, calibrate and maintain. They are run on state of the art proprietary software able to handle the reporting of a large network of weather stations and able to detect faulty sensors remotely in real time. Among other things, automatic weather stations monitor: * Atmospheric pressure * Temperature * Humidity * Wind speed and direction * Precipitation * Sunshine and radiation Fairmount Weather Systems Limited is the manufacturer of the AWSs being deployed for the Initiative. Current status As of the end of June 2009, the Global Humanitarian Forum and its partners have completed Phase I of the Initiative and installed 19 AWSs in three African Great Lakes countries: 1 in Kenya, 9 in Tanzania and 9 in Uganda. All 19 AWSs are fully operational and successfully transferring raw weather data to the NMSs. Phase II of the Initiative was expected to begin in the first quarter of 2010. About 500 AWSs will progressively be installed throughout Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, with the later addition of Burundi and Rwanda. The Global Humanitarian Forum encountered serious financial difficulties due to which the Forum had to dismiss its staff in March 2010.[1][2] On 31 March 2010 the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs announced that the Forum was over- indebted and obliged to cease its activity.[3] As of June 2, 2014, the WIFA Initiative seems to be inactive. WIFA Launch On June 18, the Global Humanitarian Forum and its President, former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, together with its partners announced the Weather Info for All Initiative. The event was held at the Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction, in Geneva, Switzerland and was attended by a number of personalities who presented the rationale for this Initiative and its benefits for the world‚Äôs poorest and most vulnerable to climate change. At this occasion, the Forum‚Äôs President, Kofi Annan, declared that ‚ÄúThe world‚Äôs poorest are also the world‚Äôs most vulnerable when it comes to the impact of climate change, and the least equipped to deal with its consequences. Today you find cell phone towers in almost every part of Africa. We have never been able to establish weather monitoring on that scale, until now.‚Äù Also present at the launch were: Michel Jarraud, Secretary General of the WMO, Carl-Henric Svanberg, CEO of Ericsson, Lord Simon Cairns, Chairman of Zain Africa, as well as Margareta Wahlstr√∂m, UN Assistant Secretary General for Disaster Risk Reduction.

Yoon So-yi stars as an ambitious and tough reporter whose life and career take a turn after she falls for a charming and persistent suitor (played by Lee Jin-wook), and marries him. But her aspirations of becoming a great reporter are put on hold while she struggles with her new life as the daughter-in-law of a rich, influential but controlling chaebol family. On the sidelines is her mentor and friend, a head newscaster (played by Kim Seung-soo) for whom she also develops uncertain feelings. Plot Growing up in a poor family, Min-joo (Yoon So-yi) finally lands a job as a news correspondent with JBC Networks after two previous failed attempts. She works hard to gain recognition as a reporter but faces a career setback due to a stroke of bad luck. With strong support from Seok-jin (Kim Seung-soo), she is able to get her career back on track. Although she has feelings for Seok-jin, she is reluctant to date him because he is a single father with one daughter. Meanwhile, Joon-sung (Lee Jin-wook), the scion of a wealthy family, enters her life and proposes marriage to her after a brief courtship. She becomes the envy of her friends when she marries him because her life is like a modern version of the Cinderella fairy tale. Her life as the daughter-in-law of a wealthy family is wonderful at first but she becomes disillusioned with her marriage when her in-laws begin to look down on her and smother her personal life. Against the wishes of her in-laws, she returns to work as a news correspondent and soon learns that the adopted son of her brother-in-law is actually the son of her husband from a previous relationship. Shocked at this revelation, she realizes that she loved Joon- sung for his family wealth and not for who he was. After contemplating on what to do, she decides that getting a divorce is her only option. Joon-sung, however, agrees to part ways in an amicable divorce without telling her that the adopted son of his brother is actually the posthumous child of his second brother... Cast Main characters *Yoon So-yi as Jung Min-joo, 26 years old :Min-joo is a hard worker. She believes in justice, respect, and that if you work hard at your dreams they will come true. This is exactly how she became a news announcer at JBC. After almost failing the exam/interview twice she finally gets her hand at being a reporter. While her true dream is to become a news anchor, she can't believe her luck when she is given this chance while on assignment. She is praised for a job well done, but she can't help but notice that her role model, Seok-jin, doesn't seem to notice. She doesn't understand why he gives her such a hard time and is secretly infuriated with him because of his rudeness. :In the meantime, she runs into Joon-sung. While he doesn't give her a good impression at first, she slowly warms up to him and is astonished when she finally finds out that he is the son of Yoo Sung Group. Throughout this story she will come face to face with two kinds of love, from Joon-sung and from Seok-jin. *Lee Jin-wook as Kim Joon-sung, 32 years old :Joon-sung is your typical cool guy, but a little smarter. After seeing how loveless his older brother's marriage is, Joon-sung is determined to fall in love with someone who he can remain passionate with for the rest of his life. Until that time, he continues to work for his father's corporation, Yoo Sung Group. While he works for a corporation during the day, at night he plays at a local jazz club. His real dream is to become a guitarist in a band... :While driving at night he almost hits a young woman who is crossing the street on a red light. This woman is Min-joo. While he normally wouldn't think twice about such an odd encounter, he picks up her diary/calendar and realizes what a spunky woman she is. He is determined to get to know her personally and it is during this time that the two fall in love. *Kim Seung-soo as Park Seok-jin, 37 years old :Seok-jin is cold to those who have not yet earned their place, which is exactly how he acts toward the fresh, young Min-joo. He's skilled at what he does and knows it, but he attributes it to his passion for the industry and the hard work that got him there. He comes from a humble background and even has a daughter from a previously loving relationship. :As he gets to know Min-joo he slowly realizes he has feelings for her. But he doesn't let this make him treat her any differently from others. He gives her a hard time, but only because he wants her to learn from her mistakes. When he discovers that his feelings are deeper than he thought, he tries to figure out whether or not to hide them because of his past, and whether or not she deserves better.

He was a great-grandnephew of vicar Jacob Schavland, nephew of vicar Gerhard B. Bergh and a brother of Sigvald Skavlan, Einar Skavlan, Sr., Olaf Skavlan and Aage Skavlan. He grew up in Trondhjem, and from 1870 to 1872 he took an engineer's education in Gothenburg.

Attendees of Pink Dot events gather to form a \\"pink dot\\" to show support for inclusiveness, diversity and the freedom to love. In addition to the titular formation, Pink Dot events usually feature concert performances and booths sponsored by organizations supporting the LGBT community and cause. Other Pink Dot events followed in several other cities, so that the Singapore event became known as Pink Dot SG. It has been held each year in Singapore from 2009 to 2019 at Speakers' Corner on a Saturday in May, June or July. The 2020 edition was held as an online livestream on 27 June, in view of the COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore. History In September 2008, the rules governing activities conducted at Singapore's Speakers' Corner at Hong Lim Park were relaxed, allowing demonstrations organised by Singaporeans to be held at the park, providing that all participants are either citizens or permanent residents. This allowed the first Pink Dot SG event to take place at the Speakers' Corner on 16 May 2009. A total of nine Pink Dot events have been held in Singapore, occurring annually on Saturdays in May, June or July. Many organisations around the world modeled LGBT events after the Pink Dot concept, often borrowing the \\"Pink Dot\\" prefix. For distinction, the Singapore events became known as Pink Dot SG. The design of the Pink Dot SG mascot \\"Pinkie\\", a personification of the pink dot, was provided by graphic designer Soh Ee Shaun. Events Each event from 2009 to 2019 took place on a Saturday at Speakers' Corner in Hong Lim Park. Pink Dot SG 2009 Pink Dot SG 2009 was held on 16 May, launched with a campaign video titled \\"RED + WHITE = PINK\\". It was Singapore's first public, open-air, pro-LGBT event and established the record for the greatest turnout for a gathering at Speakers' Corner in Hong Lim Park since the venue's inception. The event was deemed a milestone for Singapore's LGBT community. Ambassadors of the event were local celebrities: actor Timothy Nga, actress Neo Swee Lin and radio DJ Rosalyn Lee. During the event, formations of the words \\"LOVE\\" and \\"4All\\" were created by participants. The event concluded with the formation of the titular Pink Dot. The pioneer Pink Dot SG event was given extensive coverage in both international and local media. Locally, The Straits Times and TODAY newspapers covered the event. However, reports regarding the number of attendees were inconsistent. Organisers estimated an attendance of 2,500, while The Straits Times reported a turnout of 1,000, and TODAY reported \\"at least 500\\". Internationally, the event was covered by the BBC and the New York Times, with reports syndicated to publications around the world through wire services the Associated Press and Agence France-Presse. Pink Dot SG 2010 Pink Dot SG 2010 was held on 15 May, with the theme: \\"Focusing on Our Families\\". There was a turnout of 4,000 participants and the event received local media coverage by Channel News Asia and The Sunday Times. The event was also reported internationally by the BBC, the Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse. Ambassadors of the event were local celebrities: actor Adrian Pang, actress Tan Kheng Hua and DJ Bigkid. Pink Dot SG 2011 Pink Dot SG 2011 was held on 18 June with more than 10,000 participants. The event featured the theme song \\"I Want To Hold Your Hand\\" by the Beatles and a campaign video by Boo Junfeng. The event had attracted Google as a corporate sponsor, and the multinational company continued to support the event in subsequent years. Local musical cabaret trio the Dim Sum Dollies made an appearance as the official ambassadors of the event. Pink Dot SG 2011 was covered widely by local and international mainstream media. An aerial shot of Pink Dot SG was featured on xinmsn news for June's \\"2011 Year in Pictures\\". This was also the first time Pink Dot SG was featured in \\"Time Out Singapore\\" with a full article devoted to it. The event was also promoted in an article on CNNGo. International Pink Dot events were held the same day in Anchorage, Alaska; Kaohsiung, Taiwan; and London, England. Pink Dot SG 2012 Pink Dot SG 2012 was held on 30 June and had the campaign theme \\"Someday\\" and the theme song \\"True Colors\\". At this event, 15,000 participants formed a glowing pink dot with mobile phones, torches and flashlights. The event added Barclays as an official corporate supporter, alongside Google. Celebrity ambassadors were former actress Sharon Au, actor Lim Yu-Beng and drag queen actor-comedian Kumar. Pink Dot SG 2012 was widely reported in the mainstream media and by international media agencies, including The Wall Street Journal, Taiwan's lihpao, Thailand's PBS, and Egypt's bikyamasr. Singer Jason Mraz, who was giving a performance on 29 June in Singapore, made a shout-out in a video in support of Pink Dot 2012, prior to the event. The 2012 event inspired the launch of Pink Dot Okinawa, which had its first event the following year. Pink Dot SG 2013 Pink Dot 2013 was held the evening of 29 June. The event marked its fifth year under a campaign of \\"Home\\", the title of a local National Day song which doubled as the event's theme song. The campaign featured a video, directed by local filmmaker Boo Junfeng, depicting three individual true-life experiences. Like the previous year, the event included the formation of the Pink Dot with pink lights. Pink Dot organisers claimed a record turnout of 21,000, which would make it the largest civil society gathering in the country. To accommodate the large number of participants, a second \\"satellite\\" focal point was created to channel traffic away from the busiest areas. Prior to the formation of the Pink Dot, participants were treated to a range of activities by more than 20 community groups and partners. Pink Dot SG 2013's list of corporate contributors grew to include global financial firm JPMorgan Chase, local hotel Parkroyal on Pickering, contact lens specialist CooperVision and audio branding agency The Gunnery, in addition to Google and Barclays. Local actress Michelle Chia, theatre company W!LD RICE, artistic director Ivan Heng and sportscaster Mark Richmond were the event's ambassadors. The event was covered by local and international media, including Indonesia-based Asia Calling, The Economist, the BBC, The Guardian and Reuters. The event was also featured in the YouTube-sponsored video \\"Proud to Love\\", a compilation of video clips supporting the LGBT community, equal rights and marriage equality. Additionally, before the event, the band Fun made a shout-out in a video in support of Pink Dot 2013. Pink Dot SG 2014 Pink Dot SG 2014 was held the evening of 28 June with a turnout of 26,000. The event's theme, \\"For Family, For Friends, For Love\\", highlighted the LGBT community's contributions to society, and its theme song was \\"We Are Family\\". In addition to the traditional Pink Dot formation with torches, 2014's event included a blue heart formation within the Pink Dot. Pink Dot SG 2014 also featured a \\"Community Voices\\" segment, in which local LGBT individuals and straight allies were invited to speak and share their stories. Ambassadors of the event included Broadway performer Sebastian Tan, actor Brendon Fernandez and Nominated Member of Parliament Janice Koh. Taiwan-based Singaporean Pop Idol Stefanie Sun also supported the event through a 20-second video. Local YouTube stars Tree Potatoes made a shout-out in a video. Pink Dot SG 2014 saw energy company giant BP and multinational banking firm Goldman Sachs join a growing list of corporate sponsors. Pink Dot SG 2014 drew strong criticism from Singapore's Muslim and Christian communities which counter-demonstrated in a \\"Wear White\\" event, in which participants dressed in white apparel. In response, and foreseeing possible unruly behaviour, Pink Dot organisers deployed security personnel for the first time. Local media covered the controversy with full-page articles and the event itself was widely reported by foreign media. Pink Dot SG 2015 Pink Dot SG 2015 was held the evening of 13 June. The date was chosen to prevent a clash with the Islamic month of Ramadan. The event ran under the campaign title \\"Where Love Lives\\" and included a campaign video directed by local filmmaker Boo Junfeng. The event coincided with the launch of a pioneering LGBT support network for local universities. The celebrity ambassadors for Pink Dot SG 2015 included local actor Patricia Mok, Campus SuperStar winner Daren Tan and local YouTube celebrities Munah Bagharib and Hirzi Zulkiflie. However, Munah did not appear at the event, for unknown reasons. Veteran actor Patricia Mok said she wanted the local older population to support the LGBT community. The list of corporate sponsors grew to include three new companies ‚Äì social network Twitter, movie exhibitor Cathay Organisation and financial news company Bloomberg ‚Äì in addition to Google, JP Morgan, Barclay, Goldman Sachs and The Gunnery. However, PARKROYAL hotel on Pickering, which had sponsored previous events, discontinued its sponsorship, deciding to \\"[channel] resources to support other equally meaningful causes\\". Contact Lens specialist CooperVision also did not continue its support. Pink Dot SG 2015 drew increased focus from both anti-LGBT and pro-LGBT groups. Both sides received wide coverage on local mainstream media. Pink Dot SG 2016 Pink Dot SG 2016 was held on 4 June at 3 pm. Organisers did not provide an estimate of crowd size, but said the number of participants exceeded the capacity of the park. The event's ambassadors were TV host Anita Kapoor, local hip-hop artist Shigga Shay, and getai singer Liu Ling Ling. The event had 18 corporate sponsors, adding major sponsors Apple, Microsoft, and Facebook. Pink Dot SG 2017 Pink Dot SG 2017 was held on 1 July. Ambassadors included singer Nathan Hartono, paralympian swimmer Theresa Goh and actor Ebi Shankara. Singapore's Ministry of Home Affairs banned foreign residents and entities from organising and participating in the event, stating that LGBT discourse in the country should be restricted to its citizens. Only Singaporean citizens and permanent residents were thereby permitted to attend the rally; the identity card of each participant was verified at police checkpoints as they entered the barricaded park. Organisers said that 20,000 Singaporeans and residents attended the event, a drop from 25,000 and above in previous years. In addition, foreign companies such as Airbnb, Apple Inc., Facebook, Goldman Sachs, Google, Microsoft, NBCUniversal, Salesforce.com, Twitter and Uber were not permitted to sponsor the event. Despite the new regulations, 120 Singaporean companies donated to the event, making up for the loss of contributions from the multinationals. Pink Dot SG 2018 Pink Dot SG 2018 (aka Pink Dot 10) was held on 21 July, celebrating its tenth edition with the message We Are Ready. Performers for the event included local singers Tabitha Nauser and Sezairi Sezali. As part of the commemoration of this milestone, the first edition of Pink Fest was organised with several events across the few weekends leading up to Pink Dot. Pink Dot SG 2019 In 2019, during the 11th Pink Dot, Lee Hsien Yang, the brother of the Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Hsien Loong, his wife and second son Li Huanwu as well as Li‚Äôs husband Heng Yirui attended the event. Pink Dot SG 2020 The 12th Pink Dot in 2020, supposed to be held on 27 June, was cancelled in view of the coronavirus pandemic, the first time it did so. In its place was a livestreaming session where people can tune in, with the theme Love Lives Here. Despite petitions on Change.org calling for restrictions on this livestreaming event, the Ministry of Social and Family Development ruled that the event did not contravene any laws or regulations. Performances involved local artistes like Joanna Dong and Charlie Lim. Instead of the usual massive light display at the end, a digital map of Singapore was unveiled displaying pink lights across the island, all representing messages of support sent in by people through the portal https://loveliveshere.pinkdot.sg/. International events Many LGBT organisations and individuals around the world were inspired to organise their own Pink Dot events. Three were held on the same day as Pink Dot SG 2011, and many others followed the success of this event. Pink Dot events have been organised in Hong Kong, Montreal, Toronto, New York, Okinawa, Utah, Anchorage, London, Malaysia and Taiwan. Common to all events was the gathering of participants in a Pink Dot formation. Pink Dot Anchorage As an Alaska PrideFest event, Pink Dot Anchorage organised a gathering on 18 June 2011 at the Anchorage Town Square. Approximately100 participants attended and created a heart-shaped formation. Pink Dot Hong Kong =2011= On 24 June 2011, Hong Kong's Pink Alliance organised a gathering at Psychic Jack Lounge in Central Hong Kong. =2014= Inspired by Pink Dot Singapore, Pink Dot HK 2014 was held on 15 June in Tamar Park.

Pink Dot MTL Pink Dot events were held at Place √âmilie-Gamelin in Montreal, Quebec, Canada from 2012 to 2014. The movement sought to promote trust and honesty between LGBT individuals and their friends and families, so that they could coming out of the closet and bring change through open conversations. The first event on 18 August 2012, attracted nearly 300 participants. Prior to the event, a competition was held in which LGBT individuals were invited to submit their personal coming-out stories. The top three writers were sent an invitation to the event, and their stories were read in front of other participants. On 17 August 2013, a second Pink Dot MTL event was held.

A 2014 Pink Dot event was planned to be held on 29 March at the 1926 Heritage Hotel in Penang, Malaysia by Penang Freedom to Love, SUARAM and other local groups. With the slogan \\"Sit in solidarity in the day, Dance together in the night\\", Pink Dot Penang was meant to be a two-part event, including a workshop during the day and a party at night. The event was cancelled on 16 March, however, due to religious pressure from Perkasa and other Muslim activists, who made police reports claiming the event was a \\"sex festival\\". Pink Dot TO On 21 May 2016, ACAS (Asian Community AIDS Services) and the Chinese Canadian National Council's Toronto Chapter organised Pink Dot TO in Toronto, Ontario at Market 707 in support of LGBT Asians in Canada.

Originally planned to be held on 20 May, the HuaShan event was postponed due to bad weather. The event's slogan was \\"Let's get closer, let the picnic be pinker\\", with a campaign video of the same title. Pink Dot Utah Pink Dot Utah is a campaign inspired by the Singapore event with the theme \\"Support, Love, Courage\\". It aimed to engender an appreciation of Utah's diversity, including diversity of race, language, religion, sexual orientation, and gender identity or gender expression. The campaign encouraged individuals in the LGBT community to share their life stories, which are then featured on the campaign website. Pink Dot Utah was organised by the Support Love Courage Council. =2011= Pink Dot Utah 2011 was held on National Coming Out Day, 11 October, at the Spring Mobile Ball Park in Salt Lake City, Utah. More than 3,000 participants attended. Several community organisations and businesses were in attendance, including representatives from First Baptist Church and Utah's Latino community. Organisers invited Emmy award-winning composer Kurt Bestor and co-host of Fox News's Live at Five and News at Nine Newscasts Hope Woodside as celebrity ambassadors. The event was covered by local newspaper The Salt Lake Tribune. =2012= A second Pink Dot Utah event was held on 22 September 2012 in Jordan Park, Salt Lake City, Utah. The event announced winners of a \\"Pinkdot Baby Contest\\", in which parents submitted photos of their babies with a \\"pink\\" theme. The event featured performances by celebrities and speeches by various speakers. The event was supported by Mormons Building Bridges, a group that encourages heterosexual members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to offer love and support to their LGBT brothers and sisters. The event was mentioned on the LGBT blog JoeMyGod.com. Another Pink Dot event, Pink Dot St. George, was held in Utah on 3 November 2012 in Vernon Worthen Park, Saint George, Utah, featuring speeches by three speakers. The programme received local media coverage by Dixie Sun News. Reaction, criticism and controversy Counter-campaigns by religious groups In 2014, Pink Dot SG drew strong opposition from Muslim and Christian religious groups in Singapore. One response to the event was FamFest, or the Red Dot Family Movement, which was organised by LoveSingapore, a network of Singaporean churches. FamFest was initially planned to be held on the same day as Pink Dot 2014 at the Padang. However, the event was cancelled after its application was rejected by the Ministry of Social and Family Development, which deemed the location unsuitable. FamFest continued as a virtual rally on Facebook. In response to the appearance of a Muslim woman in the Pink Dot SG 2014 campaign video, Islamic religious teacher Ustaz Noor Deros called for a Wear White campaign in defence of traditional Islamic values. Notably, an evening prayer marking the fasting month coincided with the Pink Dot SG 2014 event. Faith Community Baptist Church (FCBC) and the LoveSingapore network of churches also called on their members to join local Muslims in the campaign to dress in white, and worshipers at the mosque and the two churches were seen wearing white in the days following the event. In light of possible unrest, security personnel were deployed at Pink Dot SG 2014 for crowd management purposes. However, the event proceeded without interference, with Wear White campaign organisers telling supporters to keep at a distance from the Pink Dot gathering and the FCBC announcing that its members did not intend to picket the event. Since 2014, Pink Dot has continued to experience opposition from the Wear White campaign. Other religious groups and Pink Dot 2014 Leading up to Pink Dot SG 2014, and in response to other reactions about the event, other religious groups in Singapore made statements about their stands on LGBT issues. On behalf of the Muslim community, the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (MUIS) advised Muslims not to be confrontational towards the LGBT community. The MUIS indicated that it does not approve of the \\"pervasiveness\\" of the LGBT lifestyle, but cautioned against mosques being involved in the Pink Dot or Wear White initiatives. Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs Yaacob Ibrahim issued a statement saying that Singaporeans who wanted to express support for a cause or lifestyle choice should express it in a way that does not divide the community. He emphasized tolerance and the need \\"to keep the social fabric as tight as possible\\". The National Council of Churches of Singapore (NCCS) stated: The Council also wishes to state that while it does not condone homosexual or bi-sexual practices, it also does not condemn those who are struggling with their gender identity and sexual orientation. On behalf of the Catholic Church, Archbishop William Goh stated: Goh later released a second statement apologising for any insensitivity in his previous statement and added that while the Church does not disapprove of non-sexual same-sex relationships, it is Catholic teaching that marriage is between a man and a woman and that sex before marriage is not allowed. Corporate sponsorship Up until 2017, the Pink Dot SG events featured a growing number of corporate sponsors each year. The involvement of corporations in the local LGBT scene drew criticism from various socially conservative groups. In 2015 furniture retailer IKEA, upon receiving feedback from pro-LGBT groups, announced a review of its support for a magic show staged by a pastor known for his views against homosexuality. The pastor was also responsible for previous anti-Pink Dot movements, while IKEA is known globally to be a supporter of the LGBT community. However, after the review, IKEA Singapore decided to continue support for the magic show. This decision has drawn criticism from pro-LGBT groups, including the organisers of Pink Dot, and support from socially conservative organisations. Threats of violence against the LGBT community In 2016, Bryan Lim Sian Yang, a member of the Facebook group \\"We Are Against Pinkdot In Singapore\\" threatened to \\"open fire\\" on the community. The post was widely shared on social media and attracted much attention due to the Orlando nightclub shooting. Lim claimed his post was taken out of context and was meant to be figurative. The authorities investigated Lim following police reports made about the post, and he later plead guilty to a lessened charge of \\"making a threatening, abusive or insulting communication under the Protection from Harassment Act (POHA)\\", and was fined SGD$3,500. If convicted of the original charge, making an electronic record containing an incitement to violence, Lim could be sentenced to up to five years in jail. Impact International human rights Pink Dot SG was deemed significant enough to be included in the US Department of State's Human Rights Reports for 2009, released on 11 March 2010: Pink Dot SG was also featured in the 2011 documentary film Courage Unfolds, by the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission and the Lesbian Activism Project of the Philippines. The documentary film highlights the issues faced by LGBT people in Asia. Google's LGBT campaign Google was notably the first major Pink Dot corporate sponsor and supported the event beginning in 2011. Google Singapore also launched a \\"Legalize Love\\" 2012 campaign seeking to promote a supportive culture for LGBT people in and outside the workplace. In Google Maps, Google presented a 360-degree panorama of Hong Lim Park featuring Pink Dot 2013 during both the day and night.

The castle is situated off the B6355 road approximately north of Pencaitland at . The castle is still a private residence, and is run as an exclusive-use events venue.  History  The Seton family were granted lands in East Lothian, including Winton, by King David I of Scotland in 1150. In the ensuing years the estate has passed through the hands of several eminent families. The origins of the castle date from 1480 when George, 4th Lord Seton, commenced the building of Wintoun Castle, a tower standing 4 stories high, surrounded by a defensive curtain wall. During the War of the Rough Wooing in 1544, Edward Seymour, Earl of Hertford, all but destroyed Wintoun Castle after bombardment and burning. In 1600, the family were granted the Earldom of Winton and the 1st Earl immediately set about restoration of the castle, although work ceased upon his death in 1603. His son Robert, the 2nd Earl, resigned the title which passed to his younger brother George. George commissioned William Wallace, master- mason to the king, to oversee the completion of the restoration in 1620. One of the plasterers who made the fine ceilings was John White or \\"Quhyte\\", who also worked for Lady Home at The Hirsel. White was killed at Dunglass Castle when it was destroyed by an explosion in August 1640.William Lithgow, A briefe and summarie discourse upon that lamentable and dreadfull disaster at Dunglasse. Anno 1640 (Edinburgh, 1640); HMC 2nd Report (Forbes-Whitehaugh) (London, 1871), p. 199. The completed castle was more palatial than defensive, in keeping with a new confidence after the turbulent 16th century. Prince Charles, the future King Charles I of Scotland and England, was said to have visited Winton Castle, having been tutored by Alexander Seton, 1st Earl of Dunfermline who resided at nearby Pinkie House. Charles' son, King Charles II also visited the house. In 1715, when George Seton, 5th Earl of Winton was captured at the Battle of Preston, during the Jacobite rising of 1715. His and his family's support of the exiled House of Stuart led to the Earl's imprisonment in the Tower of London, and his assets, titles and lands were confiscated. The York Buildings Company took over the Seton lands. In September 1745, Prince Charles Edward Stuart requisitioned Winton, to garrison his troops during the Jacobite rising of 1745, in the name of the Earl of Winton. The Jacobites were victorious at the nearby Battle of Prestonpans, fought on 21 September. Sir David's Loch  A new era  In 1779, Mrs Hamilton Nisbet of Pencaitland bought the castle and estate at Winton. On her death in 1797, the lands were passed to her son Colonel John Hamilton and it was he who further improved the castle by employing architect John Paterson. As well as extensive building work on the castle, Colonel Hamilton also planted extensively on the estate. Paterson's new neo-Gothic work can still be seen at Winton. The castle passed down through females until, in 1846, it came into the hands of Mary, Lady Ruthven, who did much for the village of Pencaitland, including building a new school. She also built a new hamlet, New Winton, to house the estate workers as their houses on the estate were becoming unfit for human habitation. She also carried out many improvements to castle and estate. In 1885, the house was passed to Lady Ruthven's cousin, Constance Nisbet Hamilton. Constance married Henry Ogilvy of Inverquarity in 1888. On her death in 1920, Winton Castle passed to Henry's nephew Gilbert Ogilvy, an architect. Henry, the new Laird of Winton, did much to improve the estate. He removed the Regency extension on the east wing, bridged the 19th-century north castellated lodges, and built the laundry house. He also carried out major work on the land, cutting and ploughing before planting hundreds of new trees. Gilbert Ogilvy died in 1953, the estate passing to his son David, who like his forebears, did much, with his wife Penelope, to improve Winton Castle and estate. Sir David inherited the Baronetcy from his uncle in 1956 and died in 1992, with Winton passed to his son, Sir Francis Ogilvy, 14th Baronet of Inverquarity, and his wife Dorothy. The loch in front of the house was named in remembrance of Sir David. From 1977 until 1999, a flat within the castle was home to George and Frances (n√©e Burn) Storrier. The couple separated in 1998, with George Storrier remaining in the flat until his 1999 detention to Carstairs Psychiatric Unit for the culpable homicide of his estranged wife Frances Storrier. North Lodge, Winton Castle  Today  Winton Castle is considered a masterpiece of Scottish Renaissance architecture. It contains ornate and intricate plaster ceilings, fine furniture, family treasures and many paintings by notable Scottish painters. Winton Castle is a category A listed building. The Castle is now run as an events venue. Gardens The gardens are terraced to the banks of St. David's Loch and up to the walled garden. There are several routed walkways, open to the public, passing through the estate woodlands and along the banks of the Tyne Water.

Biography  Biram was born in Bischofswerda in Saxony in 1878, the son of a modest, but successful businessman. Biram attended school in Hirschberg, Silesia. His sister Else Bodenheimer-Biram became a well known art sociologist. He studied languages, including Arabic, at University of Berlin and at University of Leipzig and earned a doctorate (Dr. phil.) at the University of Leipzig in 1902, discussing the philosophy of Abu-Rasid al- Nisaburi.Die atomistische Substanzenlehre aus dem Buch der Streitfragen zwischen Basrensern und Bagdadensern, Arthur Biram, dissertation In 1904 he concluded the rabbi seminar at the Hochschule f√ºr die Wissenschaft des Judentums. Afterwards he taught languages and literature at the Berlinisches Gymnasium zum Grauen Kloster. Biram was one of the founders of the Bar-Kochba club, and a member of the German liberal religious stream 'Ezra', which recognized the importance of high school education. In 1913, he emigrated to Ottoman Palestine. He married Hannah Tomeshevsky, and they had two sons. Both sons were killed: Aharon died in an accident while on reserve duty, and Binyamin, an engineer at the Dead Sea Works, was killed by a mine. Pedagogic career Biram founded the Hebrew Reali School in Haifa in 1913 and was appointed its first principal,The Hebrew Reali School in Haifa but a few months later, World War I broke out, and Biram was drafted by the German army and stationed in Afula. In 1919, he returned to school. As part of Biram's philosophy of education, in 1937 he implemented compulsory HagamHaganah, written by Dganit Boni-Davidi (acronym for Expanded Physical Education) training for girls in the Hebrew Reali School in Haifa, laying the foundation for recruitment of women in the Haganah, and later the Israel Defense Forces. In 1948, he resigned his post as principal, and on his 75th birthday, he authored a collection of essays on the Bible. Altogether, he wrote about 50 publications in Hebrew, German, English, and Arabic. Biram died in Haifa in 1967.  Awards and recognition  In 1954, he was awarded the Israel Prize for education.

Background On 25 October 1925, former President Emiliano Chamorro Vargas, the losing candidate in the previous presidential election, seized La Loma fortress dominating Managua and informed the American Minister that his purpose was to drive the Liberals from the Cabinet and restore the Conservative Party to office. Vargas argued that the unconstitutional procedures in the election of the Sol√≥rzano-Juan Bautista Sacasa administration voided the nonrecognition obligations of the 1923 treaty. He did not mention but everyone knew that in 1920 Vargas, as outgoing president, had insured the election of his uncle through a dishonest election.MacRenato, Ternot. Somoza: seizure of power, 1926-1939. La Jolla: University of California, San Diego. 1991. pp. 78. The American Minister at once informed General Vargas that he would not recognize any government assuming power by force.Department of State. The United States and Nicaragua: a survey of the relations from 1909 to 1932. Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office. 1932. pp. 56. After the capture of the Loma Fortress, Doctor Juan Bautista Sacasa, the Vice President, had returned to Le√≥n, remaining there in hiding. Early in November, General Vargas sent 1,200 men to Le√≥n, stating that they would be held there until Doctor Sacasa should resign. Sacasa fled the country. Unable to secure Sacasa's resignation, Vargas took steps to ascend the Presidency by means which would secure recognition of the United States.United States Department of State. The United States and Nicaragua: a survey of the relations from 1909 to 1932. Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office. 1932. pp. 56. Congress convened in December 1925 and eighteen senators and deputies were expelled. Vargas claimed they had been seated illegally after the 1924 elections.MacRenato, Ternot. Somoza: seizure of power, 1926-1939. La Jolla: University of California, San Diego. 1991. pp. 79. On 3 January 1926, Emiliano Chamorro Vargas was elected without opposition Senator of Managua, the vacancy having been created by means of the resignation of one of his friends.United States Department of State. The United States and Nicaragua: a survey of the relations from 1909 to 1932. Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office. 1932. pp. 57. On 12 January, Congress declared the Vice Presidency vacant. Congress then elected General Vargas First Designate for the Presidency. On 16 January, Congress granted President Sol√≥rzano an indefinite leave of absence, and Vargas, as First Designate, assumed executive power, thereby relegating Sol√≥rzano to a titular position. Political manoeuvers Congress did not act on President Sol√≥rzano's resignation, which had been presented on 14 January. General Vargas kept Sol√≥rzano under surveillance so that he could not leave the country and thereby disturb the technical constitutional status of the Government. The State Department, when it learned of Vargas's scheme, indicated to him that it considered that the manipulation of the laws to give him the Presidency was merely a subterfuge to obtain recognition by the United States in spite of the provisions of the Washington Treaty of 1923. Regardless of this advice, Vargas proceeded to execute his plan, thinking that the State Department, faced with the 'fait accompli' of his control, after an interval of time would recognize him. Sol√≥rzano's resignation By March 1926 Sol√≥rzano had resigned, Vice-President Sacasa had fled the country, and Vargas, \\"the unscrupulous but charismatic leader of the Conservative party, had installed himself as chief executive. The State Department, citing the unconstitutionality of Vargas‚Äôs seizure of power, denied him diplomatic recognition, thereby effectively declaring open season on the new regime. Internal order ‚Äì briefly re-established by the Conservative strong man ‚Äì again disintegrated\\".Bacevich, Andrew J., Jr. \\"The American electoral mission in Nicaragua, 1927-28\\". Diplomatic history 4, 3:241-261 (summer 1980). pp. 242. Liberal uprising The first Liberal uprising came in May 1926, capturing Bluefields and surprising even many of the party's principal leaders. Sacasa assumed leadership of the movement from abroad but did not return. Retired U.S. Army major Calvin B. Carter's aides had helped Vargas build up the National Guard to nearly full strength and armed it well with the support of the State Department. Against this now rather formidable force, the uprising collapsed almost immediately.Booth, John A. The end and the beginning: the Nicaraguan revolution. Boulder: Westview Press. Second edition, revised and updated. 1985. pp. 38. U.S. Embassy Secretary Lawrence Dennis repeatedly demanded Vargas's resignation and even incited other Conservative factions to oust him. This failed to bring results by August, however, when the year's second Liberal revolt commenced. This time the insurgents threatened more convincingly. Under the generalship of Jos√© Mar√≠a Moncada Tapia, the insurgents rapidly extended their control over most of the Atlantic area. Once again the United States landed marines in Bluefields.Booth, John A. The end and the beginning: the Nicaraguan revolution. Boulder: Westview Press. Second edition, revised and updated. 1985. pp. 38-39. Although Vargas struggled for months to consolidate his position, in October 1926 ‚Äì bankrupt, harried by a Liberal Party insurgency, and frustrated by American nonrecognition ‚Äì he resigned the presidency. Turning to the problem of designating a successor, the State Department threw its support behind Adolfo Diaz.Bacevich, Andrew J., Jr. \\"The American electoral mission in Nicaragua, 1927-28\\". Diplomatic history 4, 3:241-261 (summer 1980).242). Uriza designated President On 30 October 1926, in accordance with article 106 of the Constitution, General Vargas deposited the Presidency in the Second Designate, Senator Sebasti√°n Uriza, the First Designate being absent in the United States. The same day, Senator Sebasti√°n Uriza appointed Vargas as Commander in Chief of the Army.United States Department of State. The United States and Nicaragua: a survey of the relations from 1909 to 1932. Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office. 1932. pp. 63. In the midst of renewed revolutionary activities Sebasti√°n Uriza convoked Congress in extraordinary session. The Senators and Deputies who had been expelled by Vargas from the previous Congress were invited to return and resume their seats. The Liberal Nationalists illegally seated by the Bartolom√© Mart√≠nez-controlled Congress of 1925 were to be replaced by the Conservatives who had been declared elected by the National Board of Elections.United States Department of State. The United States and Nicaragua: a survey of the relations from 1909 to 1932. Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office. 1932. pp. 64. On 11 November 1926, Congress in joint session designated Se√±or Adolfo D√≠az for the Presidency. At this session 51 members were present out of a total membership of 67, of whom 44 voted for Adolfo D√≠az and 2 for Sol√≥rzano. Five Liberals refrained from voting, claiming infractions of the rules of procedure which prevented the complete attendance of their representatives. On 14 November Senor Adolfo D√≠az took office. The American Charge d' Affaires attended the inauguration, although formal recognition by the United States was not accorded until 17 November.

It was chiefly associated with the Kingdom of Powys, but was heavily disputed between Powys, Gwynedd, and the Norman Marcher Lords for hundreds of years, and was the scene of many skirmishes between those groups. Like many other cantrefs and subdivisions, it was divided up by the Laws in Wales Acts in the 16th century. Early history During the Roman era Arwystli formed part of the territory of the Ordovices, the Celtic tribe that controlled much of northern Wales. It is unclear when it formed as a distinct unit, but the name itself derives from the personal name Arwystl, borne by a disciple of Dubricius.Owen, p. 200; Wade-Evans, p. 42. The first reference to Arwystli occurs in the 11th-century Domesday Book, where it appears as the \\"hundred of Arvester\\". Though the cantref mostly consisted of inarable moorland, it did contain some valuable farmland in the river valleys and offered strategic access between Mid Wales and the Welsh Marches. At some point the cantref was subdivided into the commotes of Arwystli Is Coed and Arwystli Uwch Coed (Arwystli Below the Wood and Arwystli Above the Wood).Lloyd, p. 249. Important settlements included Talgarth, Llandinam, Llanidloes, and Caersws. There is some conjecture that Arwystli may have been associated with the region known as Rhwng Gwy a Hafren (). Hubert Hall suggests that it was one of the cantrefs of the obscure region once known as Cynllibiwg, located \\"between Severn and Wye\\", mentioned in the Red Book of the Exchequer.Hall, vol. II p. 762. High Middle Ages Map of Mediaeval kingdoms of Wales 700-1000 In earlier times Arwystli was evidently considered part of the Kingdom of Powys, but over time its local rulers established ties with Gwynedd. Significantly, the cantref became part of the Diocese of Bangor, which covered Gwynedd, rather than the Powys-centred Diocese of St Asaph. As such Arwystli was the scene of periodic bloody disputes between the two kingdoms. In the late 11th century it was taken by the Norman leader Roger de Montgomerie, though his claim to it was disputed by Robert of Rhuddlan, who controlled most of North Wales at the time.Darby, p. 329. It remained in the hands of Roger's heirs until the earlier 12th century, when it was retaken by Welsh lords. Over the next centuries Powys and Gwynedd resumed their violent struggle, and the Arwystli dynasty changed allegiances several times. The contention over Arwystli played an important role in the buildup to the 1283 conquest of Wales by Edward I of England. In 1263 Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, who ruled Gwynedd as Prince of Wales, approved the claim over Arwystli of Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn, Marcher Lord of the part of Powys known as Powys Wenwynwyn. In 1274, however, Llywelyn reversed his earlier decision, and claimed the cantref as part of his own Principality of Wales.Davies, p. 344. Gruffydd protested, and in 1277 Llywelyn plead his case to Edward, his suzerain, hoping for a quick resolution. The 1277 Treaty of Aberconwy guaranteed that Edward would provide full consideration to Llywelyn under the law, and also that disputes be settled \\"according to the laws of Wales for cases arising in Wales\\".Davies, p. 345. Llywelyn claimed that Arwystli was part of Wales, and as such the dispute must be settled by Welsh law, rather than the English common law of the Marches. Edward, however, used the case as a means to belittle the position of the Prince of Wales, insisting that Llywelyn must file his grievance as any other appellant, rather than receiving priority as one of the king's major vassals. This insult contributed to the widespread anti-royal sentiment that led to the revolt of 1282.Davies, p. 347. After the conquest the following year, Edward upheld Gruffydd's claim, solidifying Powys' claim over Arwystli. In the late 14th century Arwystli, along with the small lordships of Caereinion and Cyfeiliog, was taken from the Cherleton family by Edmund Mortimer. Edward Charleton retook the lost territories in 1403, during the Glynd≈µr Rising. His heirs eventually sold it to the Crown in the time of Henry VIII. Henry's Laws in Wales Acts divided Arwystli into smaller manors, and the former cantref was reorganized as Arwystli Hundred, later known as Llanidloes Hundred. It was part of the historic county of Montgomeryshire until 1974, when the area became part of the new county of Powys.

The notion of \\"superwoman\\" differs from that of \\"career woman\\" in that the latter one commonly includes sacrifice of the family life in favor of career, while a superwoman strives to excel in both. The term was also used in a somewhat similar context in the Stevie Wonder song \\"Superwoman\\", released 1972. It was the title of a 1975 book by Shirley Conran; she also wrote Superwoman 2 (1977); Superwoman in Action (1979); and Down with Superwoman: for everyone who hates housework (1990).

This life involved the pursuit of both traditional female roles in the home and with children, as well as the pursuit of traditionally masculine goals in the form of jobs and public social status. Betty Friedan, an American feminist, in her book The Second Stage argued that \\"superwomanhood\\" of the 1980s has led to double enslavement of women, both at home and at work. Her advice for feminists was to step up to the \\"second stage\\" of the feminist movement and to struggle for reshaping both gender roles and redefining social values, styles, and institutional structures, for the fulfillment to be achievable in both public and private lives without the necessity to sacrifice one for another.Feminist Thought: a more comprehensive introduction, by Rosemarie Tong, 1998, , pp. 27, 28 (a summary of Friedan's position from The Second Stage) See also *Work-life balance *Workaholic *Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead (2013) by Sheryl Sandberg ;Parenting *Helicopter parent *Slow parenting *Work at home parent Notes and references Category:Feminism Category:Sociological terminology Category:Working time Category:Feminism and the family Category:Parenting Category:Motherhood Category:Slang terms for women ","title":"Superwoman (sociology)"},{"id":"24961622","text":"IBM 6640 output IBM Magnetic Card The IBM 6640 printer was one of the world's first office ink jet printers. It was originally announced as the 46/40 but later renamed as 6640, as part of the Office System/6 word processing range in 1976. IBM claimed the 6640 combined quality printing with a very versatile and efficient automatic cut sheet-paper and envelope handling mechanic.. It featured automatic selection of 10-pitch, 12-pitch or proportional spacing with up to five resident fonts. Documents to be printed were first prepared on either on magnetic cards by a Magnetic Card Selectric typewriter, or an Office System/6 console. Magnetic card stacks were loaded via a reader attached to the left side of the printer and the device could also communicate via BSC or SDLC protocols. A model of 6640 was without a Magnetic Card Deck but was hard- wired to an Office System/6 console for direct printing. The printer itself had a large envelope drawer, and two paper drawers, each of which could handle a stack of paper up to approx. three inches thick, and up to 17 inches by 17 inches. Optional font cards were available, and installed on the planar located on the right side of the printer. Black ink was sprayed out of a single nozzle, broken into drops, and each drop was deflected by electromagnetic fields to form individual letters or symbols. Any drops not required to generate a letter were fed back into the ink system via the \\"gutter\\" for re-use. For example, a drop used for printing a letter was immediately followed by several \\"guard drops\\" that were deliberately deflected down into the gutter so as to avoid slip streaming.

Orla is one of a very few known abbesses of Kilcreevanty. It was founded in the mid-to-late 12th century and appears to have continued into the sixteenth century. Orla experienced difficulties with William de Bermingham, the Archbishop of Tuam. In 1308 she sued him for trespass, stating that > despite the fact that the abbey was under the protection of the king and > that the king had warned the Archbishop not to trouble the nuns, she and her > nuns were continually subject to excessive and expensive visitations and > demands for goods by the Archbishop. She alleged that he regularly entered > the abbey with men and horses and had seized goods to the value of one > hundred pounds. The resolution of the dispute is not known, although Gillian Kenny surmises that other motives were at work, stating that \\"The reasons for the dispute may be deeper-seated than they appear, however.\\" She was preceded as abbess by Fionnuala N√≠ Conchobair, daughter of Felim mac Cathal Crobderg Ua Conchobair. The exact duration of Orla's term of office is not known, nor the identity of her successor. That both she and Fionnuala bore Gaelic, rather than Anglo- Irish, names, points to Kilcreevanty having been a Gaelic community.

Village The village of Buttermere lies between the Lake District lakes of Buttermere and Crummock Water, and is overlooked by the summits of Grasmoor to the north and High Stile to the south. The nearest towns are Keswick and Cockermouth, both of which are approximately away. Plaque to alt=black stone plaque reading: Pause and remember Alfred Wainwright: Fellwalker, guide book author and illustrator who loved this valley. Lift you eyes to Haystacks his favourite place. 1907-1991 Buttermere church is dedicated to St James, and dates from 1840, replacing a chapel which was dedicated in 1507. It has a memorial plaque to Alfred Wainwright, in the sill of a window with a view of Haystacks where his ashes were scattered. It is grade II listed. In the village, The Bridge Hotel, stands on a site tracing back to the 11th century, where an armoury and a bakery stood, in connection with the Water-Mill Earl Boether built higher up the stream. For seven centuries the mill worked continuously, the buildings being many times renewed. Circa 1734, the buildings were sold to the church, the curate being the Reverend Robert Walker. He obtained a beer licence and originated the 'Bridge Inn'. In 1837, Jonathan Thomas Sleap purchased the property, rebuilding the inn using stone obtained from the old water will. He changed the name to 'Victoria' upon the visit by Her Majesty in 1850. In 1861, Mrs H Cooper inherited the property incorporating the bay windows, but it was the author Nicholas Size, who in 1920 extended and improved the building. Upon his death the new owner changed the name to 'The Bridge'. Peter and Janet McGuire who bought the hotel 1978, have owned the premises to the present day. The Fish Inn was the home of Mary Robinson, known as the Maid of Buttermere, when her father was its landlord. It kept this name until 2019 and is now called the Buttermere Court Hotel. Buttermere is situated on the B5289 road that runs beside Crummock Water and along the valley of the River Cocker north to Cockermouth. In the other direction, the B5289 runs via the steep Honister Pass, to Borrowdale and Keswick. A more direct, but more minor, road crosses the nearby Newlands Pass into the Newlands Valley and hence to Keswick. Civil parish The civil parish of Buttermere covers a considerable area around the village, including both Buttermere and Crummock Water lakes, the summit of Grasmoor, the north side of High Stile and the western side of Honister Pass. The smaller settlements of Brackenthwaite, to the north of Crummock Water, and Gatesgarth, at the foot of the Honister Pass, are included. The parish lies entirely within the Lake District National Park. At the time of the 2001 census the parish had a population of 127 living in 49 households, falling slightly at the 2011 Census to a population of 121 in 45 households. For local government purposes the civil parish forms part of the district of Allerdale within the county of Cumbria. Historically part of Cumberland, it is within the Workington constituency of the United Kingdom Parliament, and the North West England constituency of the European Parliament.

I/O virtualization environments are created by abstracting the upper layer protocols from the physical connections. The technology enables one physical adapter card to appear as multiple virtual network interface cards (vNICs) and virtual host bus adapters (vHBAs). Virtual NICs and HBAs function as conventional NICs and HBAs, and are designed to be compatible with existing operating systems, hypervisors, and applications. To networking resources (LANs and SANs), they appear as normal cards. In the physical view, virtual I/O replaces a server‚Äôs multiple I/O cables with a single cable that provides a shared transport for all network and storage connections. That cable (or commonly two cables for redundancy) connects to an external device, which then provides connections to the data center networks. Background Server I/O is a critical component to successful and effective server deployments, particularly with virtualized servers. To accommodate multiple applications, virtualized servers demand more network bandwidth and connections to more networks and storage. According to a survey, 75% of virtualized servers require 7 or more I/O connections per device, and are likely to require more frequent I/O reconfigurations. In virtualized data centers, I/O performance problems are caused by running numerous virtual machines (VMs) on one server. In early server virtualization implementations, the number of virtual machines per server was typically limited to six or less. But it was found that it could safely run seven or more applications per server, often using 80 percent of total server capacity, an improvement over the average 5 to 15 percent utilized with non-virtualized servers . However, increased utilization created by virtualization placed a significant strain on the server‚Äôs I/O capacity. Network traffic, storage traffic, and inter-server communications combine to impose increased loads that may overwhelm the server's channels, leading to backlogs and idle CPUs as they wait for data. Virtual I/O addresses performance bottlenecks by consolidating I/O to a single connection whose bandwidth ideally exceeds the I/O capacity of the server itself, thereby ensuring that the I/O link itself is not a bottleneck. That bandwidth is then dynamically allocated in real time across multiple virtual connections to both storage and network resources. In I/O intensive applications, this approach can help increase both VM performance and the potential number of VMs per server. Virtual I/O systems that include quality of service (QoS) controls can also regulate I/O bandwidth to specific virtual machines, thus ensuring predictable performance for critical applications. QoS thus increases the applicability of server virtualization for both production server and end-user applications. Benefits * Management agility: By abstracting upper layer protocols from physical connections, I/O virtualization provides greater flexibility, greater utilization and faster provisioning when compared to traditional NIC and HBA card architectures. Virtual I/O technologies can be dynamically expanded and contracted (versus traditional physical I/O channels that are fixed and static), and usually replace multiple network and storage connections to each server with a single cable that carries multiple traffic types. Because configuration changes are implemented in software rather than hardware, time periods to perform common data center tasks ‚Äì such as adding servers, storage or network connectivity ‚Äì can be reduced from days to minutes. * Reduced cost: Virtual I/O lowers costs and enables simplified server management by using fewer cards, cables, and switch ports, while still achieving full network I/O performance. It also simplifies data center network design by consolidating and better utilizing LAN and SAN network switches. * Reduced cabling: In a virtualized I/O environment, only one cable is needed to connect servers to both storage and network traffic. This can reduce data center server-to-network, and server-to-storage cabling within a single server rack by more than 70 percent, which equates to reduced cost, complexity, and power requirements. Because the high-speed interconnect is dynamically shared among various requirements, it frequently results in increased performance as well. * Increased density: I/O virtualization increases the practical density of I/O by allowing more connections to exist within a given space. This in turn enables greater utilization of dense 1U high servers and blade servers that would otherwise be I/O constrained. Blade server chassis enhance density by packaging many servers (and hence many I/O connections) in a small physical space. Virtual I/O consolidates all storage and network connections to a single physical interconnect, which eliminates any physical restrictions on port counts. Virtual I/O also enables software-based configuration management, which simplifies control of the I/O devices. The combination allows more I/O ports to be deployed in a given space, and facilitates the practical management of the resulting environment.

Background Saga was constructed due to dissatisfaction by the Imperial Japanese Navy with the gunboat , which was underarmed, and lacked the suitable accommodations to serve as a gunboat flagship. The Japanese Navy also wanted a vessel which could serve for both coastal patrol duties as well as on inland waterways. Saga was laid down at Sasebo Naval Arsenal on 7 January 1912, launched on 27 September 1912 and entered service on 18 November 1912.Nishida, Ships of the Imperial Japanese Navy Design The basic design of Saga was modeled after her British built predecessors, but with much larger dimensions and much more powerful engines. Saga had a hull with an overall length of and width of , with a normal displacement of 780 tons and draft of . She was propelled by two reciprocating engines with two Kampon boilers driving three shafts, producing 1600 hp and a top speed of 15 knots.Conway, Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1905‚Äì1922, page 249 The ship was initially armed with one 12 cm/45 10th Year Type naval gun guns, three / 40 cal. guns and six 6.6mm machine guns. Service record During the World War I, Saga accompanied the main Japanese fleet to Shandong Province, China at the Siege of Tsingtao (25 September-16 November 1914) against the forces of Imperial Germany as part of Japanese‚Äô contribution to the Allied cause under the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. Subsequently, she was transferred to the Japanese Second Fleet and assigned to patrols in the South China Sea. In September 1924, Saga was reassigned to the Japanese First Fleet. Commander Ch≈´ichi Nagumo served as captain from 20 March 1926 to 15 October 1926. She was reassigned to the Japanese Third Fleet from June 1931, joining the 11th Sentai in October 1937 after the Marco Polo Bridge Incident and the start of hostilities in the Second Sino-Japanese War. From 15 December 1938 to 20 October 1939, she was captained by Commander Tamotsu Oishi. From November 1939, she was assigned to the Second China Expeditionary Fleet in southern China. At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Saga was based at Guangdong and was assigned to the Japanese invasion force for the Battle of Hong Kong, where she was based afterwards. She was sunk by a sea mine on 26 September 1944 off Hong Kong, and later refloated and towed back to Hong Kong for repairs. On 22 January 1945, while still in dock for repairs, she was destroyed during an air raid, probably by USAAF 14th Air Force Consolidated B-24 Liberators.

He was indicted on corruption charges in 2013, did not run for reelection, was convicted in July 2014, and is currently back in the private sector on Long Island. He was the first adherent of Theodism ever elected to the council and one of the first neo-Pagans in hold an elected office in the US. Personal life Halloran was raised in a \\"traditional Irish household\\" and was a karaoke host and an attorney prior to running for office. He earned his Juris Doctor (J.D.) from St. John's University Law School and a B.A. in history and anthropology from the City University of New York. He worked in the New York City Police Department and several District Attorneys' offices before entering private practice as a lawyer in a firm with offices in Queens and Long Island. City council service Halloran was elected to the New York City Council from the 19th Council District, in Queens, on November 3, 2009, succeeding Tony Avella, who made a failed bid to become the Democratic nominee for Mayor of New York City. He was endorsed by the Republican, Libertarian, Independence and Conservative parties. He represented nearly 200,000 residents. In September 2010, he was named one of City Hall's \\"40 under 40\\" for being a young influential member of New York City politics.Rising Stars 40 Under 40: Dan Halloran , City & State N.Y., September 28, 2010. Halloran sat on the Fire & Criminal Justice, Public Safety, Land Use (including Landmarks, Public Siting & Maritime Uses sub- committee), Public Housing, and Mental Health, Mental Retardation, Alcoholism, Drug Abuse and Disability Services committees. Political views Halloran is a registered Republican, a fiscal conservative and libertarian. He opposes the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\\"ObamaCare\\"). He appeared as a regular commentator on the Strategy Room on Fox News where he discussed matters ranging from healthcare reform to government spending, off-shore oil exploration, and other conservative and libertarian principles. He was purportedly asked to run for U.S. Congress in the 2010 election cycle in the 5th District of New York by Republican, Libertarian, and Conservative leaders. Despite being courted by the NRCC and Representative Peter T. King to run, he withdrew from consideration, citing the economic crisis in the New York City and state budgets and the need to set the city's finances in order before he could consider taking on a run for any other office. Dan Halloran became the first elected official in New York City to publicly criticize the Park51 (Cordoba House) project near Ground Zero of the World Trade Center site, stating, \\"If we want a nation of peace... then peace comes with understanding. And they need to understand that this is sacred ground to New Yorkers.\\" \\"New York City is the greatest city in the world [a place of religious tolerance, but that tolerance] starts when you say 'I understand your pain, and I am not going to inflict more on you.' Allegation of work slowdown Halloran attracted widespread attention when he stated that five municipal employees had told him of a deliberate slowdown in clearing snow after a blizzard in December 2010. The slowdown was allegedly organized to put Mayor Michael Bloomberg in a bad light. His comments precipitated multiple criminal investigations. However, the two workers he identified did not corroborate his story, and he refused to name the three others, citing alleged \\"attorney- client privilege\\". Religion Halloran's study of the Viking Age and field research in Ireland led him to develop an interest in Germanic paganism, and eventually to Theodism, which has attracted widespread attention. He is a member of the New Normannii Reik, a branch of Heathenism. The Village Voice described Halloran as \\"America's First Elected Heathen\\"; another Reconstructionist Neopagan adherent, Jessica Orsini (who is Hellenic), had previously been elected to the city council of Centralia, Missouri in 2006.Orsini, Jessica. \\"Interview With Openly Pagan Elected Official\\" , The Witches' Voice Halloran's religion became an issue during his campaign for a city council seat after it was revealed that he was an adherent of Theodism. On his group's website, Halloran offered the following descriptions of his beliefs: \\"We believe in and honor the Gods and Goddesses of the North, spirits of the land, and the memories of our ancestors\\" and described his group as \\"a cultural, religious and martial organization; dedicated to reviving the folkways of the Norman peoples of Northern Europe.\\" Odin, Tyr and Freyr are among the deities worshipped by the group. Halloran also stated that \\"It is our hope to reconstruct the pre-Christian religion of the Germanic branch of the Indo-European peoples, within a cultural framework and community environment.\\" When asked about his beliefs, Halloran said, \\"I was raised a Roman Catholic right here in Auburndale. I was baptized into the Catholic Church and took my confirmation at 13. I attended Jesuit schools. Then and now, faith is a cornerstone of my life.\\" Halloran served as legal counsel and incorporating attorney for the New York City Pagan Pride Project. State Senator Frank Padavan stated that he felt Halloran's religion should not be an issue: \\"We have every religion under the sun in this district... It's all here; so what? As long as everybody is properly motivated, so be it.\\" These sentiments were echoed by the Queens County Republican Party chairman, Phil Ragusa, who additionally described Halloran as \\"a traditional person\\" and \\"a regular guy\\". Halloran lectured and discussed his theology on a national level. The Village Voice reported on Halloran's two years in office in the paper's November 30 ‚Äì December 6, 2011 edition in a report entitled \\"America's Top Heathen\\". The report pointed out that when Halloran was elected in an off- year campaign, he was the \\"'First Atheling' or prince, of his own Theodish tribe, called New Normandy. He had 'thralls' who swore their allegiance to him... he led his flock, about 100 people at its height, in their polytheistic celebration of the gods\\". However, on election night, November 4, 2009, Halloran thanked his law partner, promising, \\"The next time you give me advice to take a website down, I'll do it\\", referring to the now defunct New Normandy website, which had contained \\"images of Halloran in medieval garb, hoisting drinking horns and other regalia that he [Halloran] had apparently found embarrassing.\\" 2012 Congressional campaign On March 26, 2012 Halloran announced that he would campaign for a vacant US Representative seat in the newly redistricted 6th congressional district. He was the only Republican nominee, and was cross-endorsed by the New York State Conservative Party and was their nominee. He was also designated by the Libertarian Party at their state convention in April 2012. However, in the November 2012 general election, he lost to the Democratic candidate, Grace Meng. Conviction for political corruption On April 2, 2013, Halloran was arrested along with Democratic New York State Senator Malcolm A. Smith, Bronx Republican Party Chairman Joseph J. Savino, Queens Republican Party Vice Chairman Vincent Tabone, Spring Valley Mayor Noramie Jasmin, and Spring Valley Deputy Mayor Joseph Desmaret, on federal corruption charges. The complaint by the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the New York FBI field office alleged that Smith attempted to secure a spot on the Republican ballot in the 2013 New York City mayoral election through a complex scheme involving the bribery of several county Republican Party leaders in New York City. As part of the scheme, Halloran allegedly facilitated the Smith bribes and also accepted over $18,000 in cash from an undercover agent and a cooperating witness. On May 1, 2013, Halloran announced that he would not seek re-election for his city council seat. On Tuesday, July 29, 2014, Halloran was convicted of taking bribes, orchestrating payoffs, and participating in the scheme to help Democrat Smith to run for mayor on the 2013 ballot as a Republican. He was convicted both of acting as a liaison between Smith and Republican Party officials and of taking at least $15,000 in bribes for designating about $80,000 in New York City funds to a nonprofit entity, allowing the money to be embezzled through a no-show job. On Wednesday, March 4, 2015, Halloran was sentenced to 10 years in prison for the bribery conviction.. He has currently returned to private life on Long Island and is still on appeal to the 2nd Circuit US Court if Appeals as of February 2020.

On her maiden voyage in 1932 she caught fire and sank in the Gulf of Aden with the loss of 54 lives. Description Georges Philippar was a ocean liner. She was long, with a beam of and a depth of . She was a motor ship with two two-stroke, single cycle single-acting marine diesel engines. Each engine had 10 cylinders of bore by stroke and was built by Sulzer Brothers, Winterthur, Switzerland. Between them the two engines developed 3,300 NHP, giving the ship a speed of . History Georges Philippar was built by Ateliers et Chantiers de la Loire, Saint-Nazaire for Compagnie des Messageries Maritimes to replace Paul Lacat, which had been destroyed by fire in December 1928. She was launched on 6 November 1930. On 1 December 1930 she caught fire while being fitted out. Named after French Messageries Maritimes CEO Georges Philippar, she was completed in January 1932. She was registered in Marseilles. Before she started her maiden voyage, French police warned her owners that threats had been made on 26 February 1932 to destroy the ship. The outward voyage took Georges Philippar to Yokohama, Japan, without incident and she started her homeward voyage, calling at Shanghai, China and Colombo, Ceylon. Georges Philippar left Columbo with 347 crew and 518 passengers aboard. On two occasions a fire alarm went off in a storeroom where bullion was being stored, but no fire was found. The Georges Philippar class was an innovative design, experimenting with Diesel propulsion, sporting unusual square section short smokestacks (whimsically dubbed flower pots by the sailors) and an extensive use of electricity, for lighting, kitchen and deck winches. CEO Georges Philippar, created a special Greek-Latin term \\"Nautonaphtes\\" (Oil-powered ships) for advertising purposes as he felt that Diesel sounded too Germanic for post-World War One French public. At the time French sailor's lore considered giving a ship the name of a living person a way to attract bad luck and the practice was later discontinued. The electric plant and wiring of the Georges Philippar relied on high voltage (220 volts) Direct current. It proved troublesome from the shipyard stage onwards with cables overheating, circuit breakers malfunctioning ‚Ä¶ and so on. It was lavishly decorated with wood panelling and sported a high gloss varnished wooden grand staircase which proved highly flammable. Fire and loss On 16 May, while Georges Philippar was off Cape Guardafui, Italian Somaliland, a fire broke out in one of her luxury cabins occupied by Mme Valentin, when a spark from a faulty light switch ignited wood paneling. There was a delay in reporting the fire, which had spread by the time Captain Vicq was made aware of it. Vicq tried different firefighting methods, but to no avail. It has been reported that he decided to beach Georges Philippar on the coast of Aden and increased her speed, which only made the fire burn more fiercely. However, these reports are unsubstantiated as the engine rooms were evacuated and the ship was left drifting. The order to abandon ship was given and a distress signal sent. Three ships came in response. The Soviet tanker Sovietska√Øa Neft rescued 420 people, who were transferred to the French passenger ship Andre Lebon and landed at Djibouti. They returned to France on the French passenger ship G√©n√©ral Voyron. Another 149 people were rescued by Brocklebank Line's cargo ship Mahsud, and 129 more were rescued by T&J; Harrison's cargo ship Contractor. The two British ships landed their survivors at Aden. Mahsud also took the corpses of the 54 dead. On 19 May, Georges Philippar sank in the Gulf of Aden. Her position was . Albert Londres, a French journalist, was last seen trying to escape by a porthole the cabin in which he was trapped. Maurice Sadorge, the second engineering officer, tried to send him the end of a firehose from the deck above, but Londres couldn't grip it strongly enough and either fell in the sea or back into the burning cabin. His body was neither recovered nor identified. Some conspiracy theories, involving either sabotage by Ho Chi Minh or a covert assassination of Londres by the Japanese intelligence services, have been advanced but are deemed dubious. The November 1932 edition of La Science et la Vie carried an artist's impression of the burning ship on its front cover.La Science et la Vie, November 1932 photo of cover  Court inquiry  An official enquiry was held and Cdt Vicq, his officers and crew, along with some passengers appeared in court along with colonel Pouderoux chief paris Firefighter acting as an expert. Shipyard personnel were dissuaded to appear in court but later testified that the electric plant of the Georges Philippar had been troublesome from the start and that the Shipyard board had forecasted to postpone the ship's commission in order to correct the defects but later changed their minds under the pressure of delay penalties. Cdt Vicq downplayed the electrical troubles and frequent short circuits, only admitting trouble with the electric kitchen ovens and appliances (he had to have new heating resistances hastily manufactured in Yokohama as the original ones kept burning in succession, exhausting the ship's supply of spares). He chose to point out the faultless work of the emergency electrical generators, which he said were crucial in the comparatively low death toll. Captain's Vicq statements were probably biased by company loyalty for insurance reasons but the enquiry nevertheless concluded to a \\"catastrophic fire initiated by a malfunction in the high voltage DC power grid of the ship\\" and recommended to ban wooden fittings and panelling as much as possible in the design of future ships. The State of the art Normandie was one of the first ships to benefit from these new guidelines, incorporating a massively over-engineered firefighting equipment, a less troublesome Alternating current powerplant and state of the art circuit breakers. Ironically this did not prevent Normandie from burning in New-York during WW2 as an inexperienced crew of US Coastguards had taken over from the French crew and were not familiar with the equipment.

It was ordered by the Spanish governor of Santo Domingo, Nicol√°s de Ovando, and carried out by Alonso de Ojeda during a native celebration that was held in the village of \\"Guava\\" near present-day L√©og√¢ne in the territory of Jaragua of the Cacique Anacaona. History The sociopolitical structure of the island was thought to have been organized under five Chiefdoms or Cacicazgos, Recent studies however suggest that there may have been well over 30 Chiefdoms and that the 5 which were recorded by Las Casas were the ones who made contact with the Spanish upon their arrival. The Chiefdom of Jaragua was under Cacique Boechio. After Boech√≠o's alleged death of old age, his sister, Anacaona, emerged as successor and intermediate between the natives of Jaragua and the Spanish. She was reputed to have been an efficient administrator, a beautiful woman and highly respected. At that time the Spanish had an alliance with the Chiefdom of Marien through Guacanagar√≠x. Guacanagarix told the Spanish that the tribe of Xaragua was planning a rebellion. Although Anacaona had always paid her tribute she was then considered a threat by the governor. According to Las Casas in 1503 Ovando advised Anacaona that he would visit the town of Xaragua with his men to celebrate their good relations. During the celebration Ojeda and his men turned on the natives. Anacaona and her fellow native noblemen were arrested and accused of conspiracy and of trying to start a rebellion. Imprisoned, Anacaona answered with these verses: Ovando had gone to Jaragua with 300 men plus many local natives of the tribe of Marien. Ovando allegedly enticed the Caciques that were present into a batey (large hut) to witness a tournament by Spaniards. He then gave a prearranged signal and the Spaniards seized and bound the caciques, while others fell on the Indians milling outside.\\" Many of the Indians were thus killed, including 80 caciques burned alive, and Anacaona hanged. Las Casas records that there were children among the massacred. He writes that the Spanish slashed the legs off boys as they ran, and that even when some Spaniards tried to save a child by pulling them onto their horses, that another would come and \\"pierce the child with a lance.\\" Las Casas, Bartolom√©. \\"History of the Indies\\". \\"Trans.

Because of this massacre, King Ferdinand V deposed and recalled Ovando back to Spain in 1509. He died 2 years later on 29 May 1511. According to las Casas, some of those who escaped the massacre fled to the island of Guanabo, eight leagues away, but they were later rounded up and enslaved by the Spanish.

Family background Nolan was born in the town of Galway, a member of a Gaelic merchant family who settled in the town during the reign of Henry VI and Edward IV. The family's armorial designs on c. 1651 map, alongside Fallone, Lambert, Quinne, Tully and Porte, with this inscription underneath: > Conscripti cives hi gaudent leg bus urbis/Quos facit et fraters connubialis > amor. (Our common rights, these, late enfranchised, prove,/and claim a > kindred thro' connubial love). Hardiman states that \\"This family was, formerly, of the first rank and opulence and is still wealthy and respectable.\\" The Nolans were not included among the elite group known as The Tribes of Galway but the family were prosperous enough to marry into the Tribes and purchase property such as Ballinrobe castle. Thomas Nolan of the castle and town of Ballinrobe, Esq., who died 18 June 1628, \\"was possessed of most extensive landed possessions; to which his son Gregory succeeded, and out of which his widow Agnes Martin had dower\\". A town statute of 1500 mentions \\"Donell Oge O‚ÄôVollaghon, of this town, goldsmith' who was made free at the request of Andrewe Fallon, whose daughter, Julian Fallon, was married to Donell; make him free \\"on condition of maintaining him\\" (Andrew) ‚Äò'who is old and impotent\\". Thomas Oge Nolan refused to sign the 1652 Articles of Surrender. Thomas Nolan was a proprietor in the town in 1641, and was evicted by 1657. Life as a Dominican Julia Nolan was a member of the Dominican order at the time of its establishment in Galway, c. 1644. But upon the town's surrender to Charles Coote, 1st Earl of Mountrath in 1652, the nuns were expelled and exiled to Spain. Other religious women exiled included Mary Gabriel Martyn and Mary Bonaventure Browne. Return to Galway In 1686, Nolan returned with Maria Lynch; they been appointed prioress and sub-prioress, in an effort to reestablish the community in Galway. Within two years, thanks to the regime of James II of England, the nuns had both prospered and gained new recruits. Second dispersal With the defeat of Jacobite forces at the Battle of Aughrim in 1691, their future again came into question. In 1698, they were again dispersed. James Hardiman wrote of the event: > It was most deplorable ... to witness the cries and tears of these > distressed females, by which even their very persecutors were moved to > compassion. The convent was converted into a barrack; but the nuns remained > secretly in town, among their friends, under the direction of the venerable > prioress ... Hardiman further states that \\"the venerable prioress ... was released by death from all her sufferings\\" in 1701, aged 90. She was succeeded by Maria Lynch, under whom the entire community were again forced to leave Galway. Notes References * History of Galway, James Hardiman, 1820 * The Dominican Order in Ireland, A.

Kirimal is best known for his meticulous research and publications on the history of Crimean Tatars in the first half of the 20th century. He served as the editor of Dergi, one of the publications of the Institute for the Study of the USSR in Munich, and was among the first scholars to explore the fate of ethnic minorities living in the Soviet Union.  Early life  Edige's father Mustafa Shinkievich, who was descended from a Lipka Tatar family, had moved to Crimea before World War I. He was a descendant of soldiers under the command of the Golden Horde Khan Toktamish who had fled to Lithuania in the late 14th century. Born in Bah√ßesaray in 1911, Edige received his early education in Derek√∂y, near Yalta and graduated from the Russian gymnasium in Yalta. He enrolled in the Institute of Pedagogy in Simferopol, now the Crimea State Medical University, but his involvement in Crimean Tatar nationalist activities made it impossible for him to remain in Crimea.  Exile Years  The Soviet repression, marked by the arrest, execution and deportation of thousands of Tatars, forced Edige to flee to Azerbaijan and then to Iran. He arrived in Istanbul in 1932. Two years later, he joined his uncle Yakup Shinkievich, who was serving in Vilnius, a city then under Polish rule. Edige graduated from the University of Vilnius with a degree in political science in 1939. Following the invasion of Poland by German forces in September 1939, he left for Berlin and then for Istanbul. During the German occupation of Ukraine and Crimea (1941‚Äì44), Kirimal was active in Germany, trying to secure rights and protection for the Crimean Tatars, and later helped refugees from Crimea settle in German camps. Gerhard von Mende give him the title \\"President of the Crimean Tatar National Central Committee\\".  After World War  After World War II ended, Kirimal pursued his graduate studies and received his doctorate degree from the University of M√ºnster in Germany. His often quoted monograph, 'Der Nationale Kampf der Krim-t√ºrken - The National Struggle of the Crimean Tatars' (Emsdetten/Westfalen, 1952), was based on his dissertation. He joined the staff of the newly founded Institute for the Study of the USSR (Institut zur Erforschung de UdSSR) in Munich in 1954 and became the editor of \\"Dergi\\", the Institute's publication in Turkish. Kirimal published numerous articles on the history of Crimean Tatars under Russian and Soviet rule. He was fluent in Turkish, Polish and German. He retired in 1972 when the Institute closed, and died in 1980 in Munich, where he was living in exile. His body was transported from Munich to Simferopol via Istanbul by the Westeuropean Crimean Tatar Cultural Center in 2007, 27 years later.

He is a founding partner of Redbrick LMD, an opportunistic real estate investment and developments company headquartered in Washington, D.C.

Dubin ...\\" His former New York based firm Athena often sold condominiums to middle and upper-middle class buyers. His firm converted landmark buildings into luxury condominiums, some of which were bought by luminaries such as Charles Bronfman. He designed buildings to feature art by artist-sculptors such as Jonathan Cramer. He was described by New York Magazine as being one of the \\"new generation of uptown A-listers\\". Background and education Dubin's great-grandfather, grandfather, and father were all developers. He studied political science at Washington and Lee University. During his college years, he met future wife, Tiffany Rounick, whose stepfather was A. Alfred Taubman, the Detroit-based shopping mall pioneer. Dubin earned a J.D. degree at American University Washington College of Law. The pair were married in 1989 at the \\"socially prestigious\\" Temple Emanu-El in Manhattan and fashion reporters from the New York Times described that guests wore \\"crisply tailored suit jackets worn over long, narrow skirts.\\" Career A few months after graduating from law school, Dubin built 24 homes outside Annapolis and sold them for $150,000 each. The project gave him credibility to work with family members on \\"somewhat of an even keel\\". He worked in his family's real estate development firm as general counsel and helped the family develop single-family, high-rise condominium, and planned community properties. Dubin worked for the government in the position of director of the $1.7 billion National Land Fund for the Resolution Trust Corporation. This agency disposed of assets acquired by the government during the early 1990s. It exposed him to the world of high finance \\"a tool that was somewhat lacking in my skill sets\\" he recalled later. Dubin formed strategic partnerships between the private sector and the government. He described his role: \\"I was a federal official running clean up for all the non-performing land in the United States.\\" He serves as chairman of the Maryland Governor's Workforce Development Board. State of Maryland, Maryland Department of Labor, September 2019, Board Members - Governor's Workforce Development Board (GWDB), Retrieved November 4, 2019 Athena In 1993, Dubin founded the Athena Group, a residential real estate investment and development fund. It was structured legally as a limited liability company or LLC. Dubin was both president and CEO. The business approach was to identify opportunistic real estate projects. \\"My goals at the time were to buy real estate below replacement cost and to redevelop neglected assets.\\" Dubin hired Rosen Consulting to do macroeconomic forecasts of job development and household formation in key cities in the United States. The next step was having acquisitions people hunt for opportunities in those markets. Dubin hired analysts typically with Master's degrees in Real Estate as well as MBAs who he felt were \\"well rounded individuals\\" and \\"tactile with numbers\\" yet had a feel for \\"concepts and form.\\" Employees were encouraged to listen attentively to the market, and included former lawyers, bankers, textile design curators, tank platoon commanders, architects, and construction managers. Athena had weekly development meetings with employees at all levels as a way, in part, \\"for teaching the younger people the business.\\" The firm cooperated with state and local officials. Dubin saw his work as a developer at the confluence of many forces, including investors, regulators, architects, and found the work to be fascinating. Athena developed a proprietary fund in association with large investment banks such as Morgan Stanley and UBS which gave it ready access to cash for large projects; for large deals, Athena solicited partners. Dubin described his firm as existing in a \\"nether land where we have the capitalization of a public company and the nimbleness of a private company.\\" In the early 1990s, the firm had a return on investment equity over 30%, according to Dubin. While the principal focus of Athena was on residential properties with \\"high barriers to entry\\" in the eastern United States, principally New York City, the firm also did projects involving offices, condominium conversions, land development deals, distressed debt purchases, and renovation projects. Dubin's role in the firm has been described as developing and cultivating relationships with parties necessary for big deals, including financiers, advisers, investment banks, developers, architects, and builders. The firm screened and analyzed possible acquisitions. When it found properties to buy, it would analyze a prospective purchase in depth, including doing due diligence, which is a comprehensive real estate checklist process of examining systematically such details as environmental issues, geological and marketing factors. It thrived during the real estate boom years during the early and middle years of the 2000s. In the early 2000s, Athena bought a building in Miami's South Beach called The Waverly. It got an internal rate of return in the low 20s, according to Dubin. Around this time the firm had a project in Providence, Rhode Island, called the \\"903\\", which featured prices in the range of $350 per square foot. In 2002, the firm encountered a setback when 78-year-old Taubman was convicted of price-fixing in connection with his ownership of the Manhattan-based auction house Sotheby's and he spent ten months in jail. In 2004, Athena had $265 million in residential and commercial sales. Condos were pitched at middle to upper-middle class buyers, and prices were at or below the median prices for their respective cities, and ranged from $200 to $2,000 per square foot, according to Dubin. By 2005, during the real estate boom, it had invested $200 million in properties worth a total of $1 billion, according to one estimate. At one point, the firm had a construction and development pipeline exceeding $1.8 billion, according to one source. From 2002 to 2005, Athena focused on condominium conversion projects, but after 2005, shifted to real estate development which included building new high-rise structures from the ground up. It worked with Detroit-based construction contractor Walbridge Aldinger on tasks such as preconstruction, estimating, predevelopment and construction- bidding work. In 2005, the shortage of prime space in downtown Manhattan caused several hotels to be converted to condominiums. Dubin explained that \\"economic calculations heavily favor conversion ... For a 1,000-square-foot hotel suite, you could get $2 million. At a top hotel with services and a great location, let's take those two rooms‚Äîthey have to throw off $400 to $500 a night, and they have maybe 70 percent occupancy ... In the best of cases, they could net $200,000 [per year]. Property taxes take 35 percent, maybe 40 percent for operations‚Äîthat's only a 5 to 6 percent return.\\" In the first part of the decade as well, Athena considered investments in projects in Russia but pulled out because of concerns about timing. Athena did projects in the suburbs of Washington, Florida, Providence, North Carolina, Utah, Las Vegas and Los Angeles. Athena's projects have been financed by firms such as Morgan Stanley and UBS AG. By 2008, it had up to 45 employees with a main office in New York and branch offices in Los Angeles, Miami, and Washington, and had 4,500 residential units under management, according to a source based on company information. By 2009, according to one estimate, the firm had completed or developed roughly $2.5 billion in assets. The firm streamlined payment systems by using software from firms such as AvidXchange which digitized invoices. The firm made campaign contributions to both Democrats and Republicans, including John McCain, Mitt Romney, Robert Menendez, and Hillary Clinton. Fifth Avenue Opulence In the late 1990s, a prominent headquarters building for the 11-story Union of American Hebrew Congregations at 838 Fifth Avenue at 65th street, originally built in 1950, was bought by A. Alfred Taubman, and who worked with Athena to convert the units to luxury condominiums. Sonnenblick-Goldman arranged some of the financing. The building is opposite Temple Emanu-El. Athena worked with architects Beyer Blinder Belle and created storage rooms, wine cellars, and servants' quarters for each unit. There was controversy about how to handle religious inscriptions on the building's exterior, which included \\"Love Thy Neighbor As Thyself\\" and \\"Do Justly Love Mercy Walk Humbly With God\\", and discussion was picked up in the New Yorker. The building features a \\"discrete access ramp\\" for the disabled on the southeast corner. It was converted from an 11-story office building into a 10-unit residential condominium project. The building was expanded by adding one floor and a 10-story addition on 65th Street. Limestone from the same quarry in Indiana used for the original building was used for the restoration. According to spokesperson Bret S. Bobo, developers were drawn to the building because it was \\"the only opportunity left in a prime location.\\" Apartments ranged from 4,522 to . Interiors were demolished and reconfigured with nine- foot-high ceilings, and included corner living rooms of up to 47 by and libraries with wood-burning fireplaces. Buyers had the option of purchasing one of seven ground floor studio apartments. Nine wine cellars and fifteen storage units were for sale in the basement. One unit was bought by Charles Bronfman, co-chairman of Seagram, and the sale was reported to be $18 million, according to several sources. Other units sold for $16 million and $12 million and were described in New York Magazine as chic. Renovation work happened in 2000 and 2001. Liberty Lofts In the early 2000s, Athena acquired and converted the Liberty Warehouse property in the Lincoln Center district of Manhattan at 43 West 64th street. Sonnenblick-Goldman arranged financing for the deal, according to one source. The building was described as a \\"quiet enclave\\" and \\"very residential\\" and close to midtown, shopping, transportation, and restaurants. Dubin said \\"It's the first project on the Upper West Side to truly incorporate loft living.\\" Athena took the old Liberty Warehouse and modernized it; since it operated an entire block, the new building featured a drive-through area for valet parking. Renovated units were priced from $1 million and $4 million, and penthouses cost between $5 million and $10 million. The new building was marketed as \\"Liberty Lofts.\\" Since 1902, the building had a high copper statue built in Akron, Ohio that was closely modeled on the Statue of Liberty and which was visible from Lincoln Center. Dubin appealed in the New York Times for ideas about what to do with the statue. During renovation, Athena added four floors, reclad the building, and created loft-style condominiums ranging from 1600 to . In February 2002, the Liberty statue was moved to the Brooklyn Museum of Art. Residents included Gretchen Carlson, host of the CBS Early Show and her husband Casey Close. Central Park North In 2003, Athena bought Harlem property on Central Park North. Initial plans called for a 20-floor high-rise doorman-building with 80 units targeted to upper-middle-class families and single professionals with prices for each unit ranging from $500,000 to $1.7 million. Dubin said \\"This is an opportunity for New Yorkers to be on the park at roughly half the price of Central Park South.\\" The rebirth of Harlem along Central Park north had attracted celebrities such as Marcia Gay Harden, Maya Angelou, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. The finished building was 20 stories tall with 48 residential units, 9,500 of ground floor retail space, 48 parking spaces, and each unit had a view of Central Park. In December 2006, 30% of the units had been presold, and prices per square foot were about $1,200, and parking spaces cost $75,000. To encourage sales, Dubin teamed with Esquire Magazine and its advertisers to throw a lavish party in September 2007. Cramer made the outdoor sculpture called The Shape Matrix that greets visitors upon arrival to the property. According to one report, Athena and the magazine commandeered, for the party, \\"a pair of penthouses, a 4,000-square-foot triplex with an additional 1,700 square feet of terraces,\\" with a projection screen to \\"mimic an airplane's interiors, courtesy of Lufthansa.\\" A living room with ceilings featured designs by Versace and Campion Platt. The showroom penthouse was listed for $8.5 million, and most apartments, featuring three bedrooms, two and a half baths, and of space, were listed at $2.1 million. Esquire magazine described some of the units as the \\"ultimate bachelor pad.\\" One newspaper account suggested the property was \\"the only condominium in Harlem that has achieved a sales price of $1,000 a square foot.\\" By August 2007, more than 70% of the building was sold with prices sometimes reaching $1,200 a square foot, according to Dubin. The A Condominiums in Jersey City Athena developed luxury condominiums across the Hudson River from Manhattan in Jersey City Developers thought that across-the-river condominiums were \\"an attractive alternative for high net worth apartment seekers who want to remain in the metropolitan area,\\" according to a quote in the newspaper from one of the financiers. Dubin noted that Jersey City was in a \\"phenomenal housing boom.\\" The deal was finalized, and construction began in November 2005. The skyscraper was close to subways called PATH trains for Manhattan-bound commuters. Dubin worked with financial advisers Sonnenblick-Goldman who helped secure construction loans from Chicago-based financiers Corus Bank and GoldenTree InSite Partners. One estimate was the project was valued at $112 million in debt and equity. A second estimate was $110 million. Dubin brought in architects from the Hillier Group as well as Schuman, Lichtenstein, Claman and Efron who designed the brick and glass facade. The project, dubbed \\"A\\" Jersey City, was a 33-story tower with 250 apartments, of ground-floor retail space, a 238-space parking garage from the second through sixth floors. Dubin again brought in artist-sculptor Jonathan Cramer who made a sculpture entitled \\"The A\\" outside the building. Each unit had its own balcony and were marketed to consumers as having \\"panoramic views\\" of the Manhattan skyline. To make the condominiums attractive to upscale buyers, amenities included around-the-clock concierge and personal assistant services, a private fitness center, a westward-facing terrace, and each unit had 9'4\\" ceilings. Dubin commissioned public sculptures to promote the project. Public Speaking Dubin spoke at public meetings regarding real estate trends. Dubin gave the commencement speech at Columbia University's Masters in Real Estate Development graduation in 2007. Dubin returned to his alma mater, Washington College of Law at American University, to speak on real estate topics on several occasions. Dubin believes there is a need for affordable housing and thinks \\"low density zoning\\" would be beneficial in some communities; in others, \\"abysmal, high profile failures\\" have tainted the image of high-density projects. He has been a panelist on discussions about condominium development and conversion. Dubin was on television in 2007. In a commencement speech at Columbia University's graduate real estate program, he emphasized the importance of listening and how it requires patience and discipline to listen effectively. Bust The real estate bust beginning 2007 and extending into 2008 hit Athena hard. Dubin, along with many other developers, did not predict the down-cycle; financing dried up; plans stalled, and then were dropped. In September 2006, there were plans to develop another property in Jersey City by working with the Netherlands-based Office for Metropolitan Architecture and architect Rem Koolhaas. A mixed-use, $300 million joint venture project featuring retailers, restaurants, and housing units in northern Las Vegas with Vestar Development dubbed \\"Heart of North Las Vegas\\" was planned in 2007, which was supposed to have \\"outdoor fireplaces, pop-jet fountains, a video wall, a performance stage, shaded pedestrian walkways and tailored landscaping.\\" There were plans to promote the Las Vegas project with a \\"naming contest\\" in which the winner would receive free college payments for four years to any college. Credit dried up; the real estate bubble burst; plans fizzled. One real estate journal reported that \\"Athena Group ... created a lot of hype over a 160-acre, mixed- use development ... by asking the community to come up with a name for it and awarding a four-year college scholarship to the winner. That's about as far as it's gone.\\" Plans to break ground in 2007 were delayed. Dubin said in 2008: \\"We have put off a number of projects for the foreseeable future.\\" Rebirth In 2008, Dubin and Athena parted ways, and he formed another real estate firm called LMD Worldwide LLC which was patterned after his initials. The St. Joe Company Louis Dubin joined the Florida land developer named the St. Joe Company in June 2012 as an executive where he structured large scale development partnerships and worked on the strategy, tactics and vision.http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20120612006315/en/St.-Joe- Company-Announces-Louis-Dubin-Joins Redbrick LMD In the Fall of 2013, after his work at St. Joe Company, Mr Dubin merged LMD Worldwide with Redbrick, a prominent Washington D.C.-based real estate investment and development firm which specializes in opportunistic and value-added residential and mixed-use projects with a focus on the Washington, D.C. metropolitan market. Personal life Dubin is married to media entrepreneur Martine Dubin and has 3 children, a daughter from his first marriage to Tiffany Rounick, a stepson, and a son. Dubin works with the Real Estate Advisory Committee of the New York Common Retirement Fund. He is the Co-Chair of the Cyber Security Task Force of the Governor's Workforce Board for the State of Maryland. Dubin was described in New York Magazine in 1998 as one of the city's social leaders who were \\"all born after the baby boom and free of its disdain for old conventions\\", and was a member of the \\"uptown A-listers\\" including Prince Alexander von F√ºrstenberg, Pia Getty, The Crown Princess of Greece, and fashion designer Carolina Herrera Jr. References External links * Redbrick LMD website * Dubin on Governor's Workforce Development Board Video Sept. 2018 Category:Living people Category:Businesspeople from New York City Category:1963 births Category:American Jews Category:American real estate businesspeople Category:Washington College of Law alumni Category:Washington and Lee University alumni ","title":"Louis Dubin"},{"id":"24962116","text":"Slingshot, in comics, may refer to: * Slingshot, an alias used by the Image Comics character Menagerie (Image Comics) * Slingshot, the alias of Marvel Comics character Yo-Yo Rodriguez * Slingshot (Transformers), a Transformer who has appeared in comic book adaptations of the toys * Slingshot (DC Comics), two DC Comics characters See also *Slingshot (disambiguation) References ","title":"Slingshot (comics)"},{"id":"24962123","text":"Kyakhtinsky District (, ; , Khyaagtyn aimag) is an administrativeResolution #431 and municipalLaw #985-III district (raion), one of the twenty-one in the Republic of Buryatia, Russia.

Banesco's Caracas headquarters, Ciudad Banesco, at 65,000 m¬≤, is second Latin America's largest bank headquarters after brazilian bank Bradesco Headquarters. History Banesco is one of the first Venezuelan banks holding only Venezuelan capital. It was founded in 1977 as the Banco Agroindustrial Venezolano (Venezuelan Agroindustrial Bank), until it changed its name to Banco Financiero (Financial Bank) in 1987. In 1992, after changing their name to Bancentro, the bank was acquired by the Banesco Financial Organization, the banking division came to dominate the company and was combined with the other divisions to form a banco universal (universal bank) (i.e. a bank that competes in all banking sectors like commercial banking, investment banking, lending, etc.). Banesco Banco Universal was first founded as a brokerage house, in 1986, under the name of Escotet Casa de Bolsa. It started working on the financial industry in 1992, after the acquisition and takeover of a regional bank named Grupo Bancentro, that after this , obtained the name Grupo Financiero Banesco (Banesco Financial Group). Since then, the founders of this institution have emerged other banking business with their own, turning them into Banesco Banco Universal in 2002. The most remarkable facts in Banesco's history are as it follows: * 1986 ‚Äì Casa de Bolsa Escotet Valores, brokerage house was founded. * 1991‚Äì1992 ‚Äì The company changed its name to Banesco Casa de Bolsa after buying Grupo de Empresas Bancentro (a banking group that owned other banking business, including Banco Financiero bank, that changed its name in 1990). * 1992‚Äì1993 ‚Äì After changing its commercial name, the companies under Grupo Bancentro identified themselves as Banesco Banco Comercial, Banesco Banco Hipotecario (for mortgages services), Banesco Fondo de Activos L√≠quidos and Banesco Arrendamiento Financiero. Additionally, Banesco Fondo Mutual, Banesco Sociedad Administradora de Fondos Mutuales, Banesco Sociedad Financiera, Banesco Seguros, Banesco Banco Internacional Puerto Rico, Banesco Banco Internacional Panam√° and Banesco Mercado de Capitales were created. Thus, the expansion of this banking business started to happen into new frontiers. * 1997 ‚Äì The Emergency Financial Assistance approved the merging between Banesco Comercial, Banesco Arrendamiento Financiero and Banesco Fondo de Activos L√≠quidos. That same year, the Banking Superintendence authorized Banesco Comercial C.A. to start working as an international bank, called Banesco Banco Universal. Its website is launched for the first time. * 1997 ‚Äì Banesco bought five small banking businesses, Bancarios, El Porvenir, La Industrial and Caja Popular. * 1998 ‚Äì The Emergency Financial Assistance approved the unification of the small banking businesses bought by Banesco, now known by the name Caja Familia Entidad de Ahorro y Pr√©stamo. * 2000 ‚Äì On 23 March 2000 the merging from La Primera Entidad de Ahorro y Pr√©stamo to Caja Familia Entidad de Ahorro y Pr√©stamo got approved. * 2001 ‚Äì During this year, the biggest and most important merging between banking businesses in Venezuela happened, Caja Familia Entidad de Ahorro y Pr√©stamo, Banco Uni√≥n (founded in 1946), Cr√©dito Uni√≥n C.A and Banesco Inmuebles became Unibanca Banco Universal. The merging took place on 12 February 2001. * 2002 ‚Äì The merging process between Banesco and Unibanca finishes, turning into Banesco Banco Universal, adopting Unibanca's old logo. Banesco starts to become the most important bank on private banking in Venezuela. Internationalization The internactonalization process started in 1992‚Äì1993, with the founding of the bank in Panama and in Puerto Rico, each one with an international operating license. Since then, its presence on international banking markets has increased and reached the United States (only in Florida), Panama, Dominican Republic, Colombia and Spain. It has been considered to grown even bigger in Latin America.

The building used to be used for the department store Sears Roebuck of Venezuela, until it left the country and was bought by another department store brand, Maxi's. Banesco bought the building in 2004 and reopened it under a brand new concept, which suits the bank's needs better than it did before. Thanks to the changes made, Ciudad Banesco became an eco-friendly building, thus the materials used to its refurbishments. Ciudad Banesco was awarded with the Premio Annual Construcci√≥n 2004 (Annual Building Awards), given by C√°mara Venezolana de la Construcci√≥n (Venezuela's Construction Chamber).

Initially, it was called Torre Union (Union Tower) property of the old banking business Banco Union that, after the merging with Caja Familia (member of Grupo Banesco) it became Unibanca. After the merging process had finished, it became Banesco and the tower was sold to the Venezuelan government. Currently, it serves as the main office for the Ministerio de Educaci√≥n Universitaria, Ciencia y Tecnolog√≠a (Ministry of High Education, Culture and Technology). Its former vaults, where Banco Union used to be, have been turned into a printing warehouse, where all the governmental material is printed, such as books and other hand-outs, it also is the main office for the Fundaci√≥n Impresa Cultural, an extension for the National Printing House (where National Gazettes get printed) next to the main entrance, there is a little square called \\"Plaza Uni√≥n\\" (Union Square), but in 2002 it changed its name for \\"Plaza Unibanca\\" (Unibanca Square).

Charitable purposes Carers UK provides information to carers and leads campaigns to improve carers' rights and tackle inequality. It has been instrumental in securing the first ever legal rights for carers. These include : * the Carers (Recognition and Services) Act 1995 * the Carers and Disabled Children Act 2000 * the Carers (Equal Opportunities) Act 2004 * the Work and Families Act 2006 Carers UK also organises Carers Rights Day, produces leaflets and a magazine, and has a free carers helpline. The registered address is 20 Great Dover Street, London, SE1 4LX. Governance and organisation Carers UK is a Trustee-led organisation, with a membership that has fluctuated between 7-40,000 individual members. Members at the AGM ratify the appointment of the Trustees who must always be a majority of carers. Carers UK currently has staffed offices in four major UK cities- London (Headquarters), Glasgow, Belfast, and Cardiff. National committees exist in the devolved countries with some degree of autonomy to formulate local responses to the national devolved assemblies and their policy processes. History and origins In 1965 the National Council for the Single Woman and her Dependants was formed following a letter to The Times by a carer, the Reverend Mary Webster, concerning the difficulties that confronted single women when they faced the complex task of earning the family living and caring for the home, the sick and the elderly. She began writing to newspapers, journals, MPs and peers drawing attention to the isolation and financial hardship that women carers were suffering. Her letters received a huge response from hundreds of women in similar situations. Baroness Seear was an early supporter. Due to her intervention, a meeting was held in the Grand Committee Room of the House of Commons. Other early supporters and fundraisers included Sir Keith Joseph, MP. The NCSWD was instrumental in securing the first ever right for carers in the Dependant Tax Allowance in 1967 as well as contributing towards the campaign to introduce Attendance Allowance, the benefit for people aged over 65, as well as securing Invalid Care Allowance, later renamed Carer's Allowance which is still the main benefit for carers today. In 1981 Judith Oliver, a carer for her husband founded the Association of Carers, aided by a grant of ¬£9,879 from the Equal Opportunities Commission. The group campaigned for Invalid Care Allowance to be extended to married women. Following a test case brought to the European Court on behalf of Jackie Drake, in June 1986 the government was forced to capitulate. In 1982 The National Council for the Single Woman and Her Dependants was renamed \\"The National Council for Carers and their Elderly Dependants\\" in an attempt to be more inclusive. Carers National Association was formed by the merger of the two existing voluntary organizations on 14 May 1988, and was renamed Carers UK in 2001. The Chief Executive is Helen Walker.

Its originator was Gergan Tharchin who was at the same time its journalist, editor, and manager.  History  Creation (1925) In 1925, The Tibet Mirror (Melong) was founded at Kalimpong in West Bengal. After The Ladakh Journal (Ladakh Kyi Akbar), it is the second Tibetan language newspaper to have been started. Its founder was one Gergan Dorje Tharchin, a Tibetan of Christian denomination who was a pastor at Kalimpong, at the time a border town that acted as a centre for the wool trade between Tibet and India. He was born in 1890 in the village of Poo (Wylie: spu) in Himachal Pradesh, he had been educated by Moravian missionaries.Thubten Samphel, Virtual Tibet: The Media, in Exile as challenge: the Tibetan diaspora (Dagmar Bernstorff, Hubertus von Welck eds), Orient Blackswan, 2003, 488 pages, especially pages 172-175 - , .Lobsang Wangyal, The Tibet Mirror: The first Tibetan newspaper, now only a memory, Lobsang Wangyal's personal site, 12 May 2005. Nevertheless, there was no article attempting to proselytise in the newspaper. Periodicity and circulation Published on a monthly basis, the journal first came out in October 1925 under the title Yulchog Sosoi Sargyur Melong (Mirror of News from All Sides of the World) ).Lobsang Wangyal, op. cit.: Yulchog Sosoi Sargyur Melong (Mirror of News from All Sides of the World) was the original Tibetan name of the Tibet Mirror. The first issue of the newspaper came out in October 1925. The issues came out at irregular intervals. All 50 copies that were printed were sent to Gergan Tharchin's friends in Lhasa, including one for the 13th Dalai Lama who sent a letter encouraging him to continue with the publication and became an ardent reader. (The 14th Dalai Lama was to inherit the subscription.)Lobsang Wangyal, op. cit.: Of the fifty initial copies, most were sent to his friends in Lhasa, including one to the 13th Dalai Lama. The 13th Dalai Lama became an ardent reader of the paper and encouraged Tharchin to continue with the publication (...). The current 14th Dalai Lama inherited the subscription of the late 13th. Gergan Tharchin Tharchin was at the same time journalist, chief editor and publisher. He would select the news from the newspapers of which he was a subscriber, and translate them into Tibetan for the journal.Lobsang Wangyal, op. cit.: \\"It was my grandfather who did all the work of the newspaper. He selected the news from the newspapers he subscribed to and translated them for the paper.\\" He had assigned to himself the goals of awakening Tibetans to the modern world and opening up Tibet to the outside world.Lobsang Wangyal, op. cit.: Tharchin (...) made much effort to report on affairs of the world, to educate Tibetans and to encourage the opening up of Tibet to the changing modern world. The journal reported on what went on in the world (the Chinese Revolution, the Second World War, the independence of India, etc.) but also and above all in India, Tibet and Kalimpong itself Thubten Samphel, op. cit., p. 173: The Mirror published articles on world events and especially reported what was taking place in India, Tibet and in the region of Kalimpong. Influence Despite its minuscule circulation, the journal exerted a huge influence on a small circle of Tibetan aristocrats, as well as on a smaller circle of reformists.Thubten Samphel, op. cit., p. 173: Despite its minuscule circulation, the impact of Tibbet Mirror, though confined to a small circle of Tibetan aristocrats and an even smaller circle of Tibetan reformists (...) was enormous. As the journal was an advocate of Tibet's independence, Tharchin's place became a meeting place for Tibetan nationalists and reformists anxious to modernise their country facing China's imminent return.Thubten Samphel, op. cit., pages 173 and 175: Tibetan nationalists, scholars and dissidents held regular conclaves at Babu Tharchin's place to discuss how Tibet could best avoid the gathering political storm, Tharchin Babu and the office of Tibet Mirror became the meeting point of intellectuals and reformists who wanted to modernize Tibet so that it would effectively counter the challenges posed by a resurgent China. Tharchin was in close touch with the British intelligence agents operating out of Kalimpong, a town that was a nest of political intrigue involving spies from India and China, refugees from Tibet, China, India and Burma, plus Buddhist scholars, monks, and lamas. He was acquainted with Hisao Kimura, a Japanese secret agent who had visited Mongolia on an undercover mission for the Japanese government, then travelled across Tibet to gather intelligence for the United KingdomBarun Roy, op. cit. : In the late 1940s, Kalimpong (...) could be rightly described as a nest of political intrigue, involving British, Indian and Chinese spies, refugees from Tibet, China, India and Burma, with a sprinkling of Buddhist scholars, monks and lamas. In the 1950s, the Chinese Communists attempted to woo Tharchin through a Tibetan aristocrat who requested him not to publish anymore \\"anti-Chinese\\" article, and to concentrate instead on the \\"progress\\" made by China in Tibet, against the promise of a Chinese order of 500 copies of the newspaper, and the assurance not to go bankrupt. Tharchin refused. Demise (1963) The Tibet Mirror ceased publication in 1963 after the exiled Tibetans brought out their first newspaper ‚Äì Tibetan Freedom ‚Äì started by Gyalo Thondup from Darjeeling Thubten Samphel, op. cit., p. 175: Tibet Mirror ceased publication in 1962 when the Tibetan refugees brought out their own newspaper called Tibetan Freedom from neighbouring Darjeeling. Besides, Tharchin was too old to continue publication. He died in 1976 Lobsang Wangyal, op. cit.: the paper came to an end in 1962, and Tharchin died in 1976. \\"My grandfather was getting too old to continue the paper\\" .

CP-3 was initially fueled with natural uranium and used heavy water as a neutron moderator. In January 1950, the reactor was dismantled due to suspicion of corrosion of the aluminum cladding that surrounded the control rods. The reactor was rebuilt and redesignated CP-3‚Ä≤ (CP-3 prime). It was restarted in May 1950 and operated until 1954. The reactor was authorized to operate up to 300 kilowatts. The two versions of the reactor were used in physics studies, fission product separations, tritium recovery from irradiated lithium, and studies of radionuclide metabolism in laboratory animals. After the reactor was decommissioned, the fuel and heavy water were shipped to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The containment shell for the reactor had pipes, valves, and building debris placed inside and was then filled with concrete. The shell was buried on the site in a deep pit.

Drawing by Gentile Bellini. An Ottoman embassy to France occurred in 1534, with the objective to prepare and coordinate Franco-Ottoman offensives for the next year, 1535.Garnier, p.88 The embassy closely followed a first Ottoman embassy to France in 1533, as well as the Conquest of Tunis by Hayreddin Barbarossa on 16 August 1534, which marked a strong reinforcement of Ottoman positions in the Western Mediterranean. Arrival of the embassy The Ottoman delegation arrived from Constantinople via Tunis at the French harbour of Marseille in October 1534. The delegation included two French ambassadors to the Porte who had accompanied them from Constantinople: Antonio Rincon and Cantelmo.Garnier, p.89 The contemporary French writer and eyewitness Valbelle would comment: The delegation was not composed of pirates, but of janissaries, clad in uniforms with immaculate turbans. They travelled overland with Antonio Rincon, and reached Francis I at his court in Ch√¢tellerault. The embassy visited Francis I at his court in Ch√¢tellerault. In January 1535, the embassy attended the execution of Protestants in front of Notre-Dame de Paris. At that time, Francis I was confronted with the Affair of the Placards, in which Protestants issued pamphlets criticizing the Mass in view of stopping efforts at a Catholic-Protestant rapprochement. Francis I was severely criticized for his tolerance towards Protestants, and had to pursue them.Garnier, p.90 The Ottoman ambassadors accompanied Francis I to Paris, and attended the burning of those responsible for the Affair, on 21 January 1535 in front of the Cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris. Together a master plan was established for 1535, combining a revolt of pro-French factions in Italy; an Ottoman attack on Apulia and Calabria; an attack by Barbarossa from Tunis on Sicily, Naples and Tuscany; and attacks by England, Scotland and Denmark on the Low Countries, with the help of the German princes allied to France William of F√ºrstenberg and Christopher of W√ºrttemberg. Departure and aftermath The embassy departed Paris on 13 February 1535 with the new French ambassador to the Porte, Jean de la Forest, accompanied by Charles de Marillac and the scholar Guillaume de Postel. Jean de la Forest would successfully negotiate the Capitulations giving advantages and pre-eminence to France in relations with the Ottoman Empire.Garnier, p.91 De la Forest also had secret instructions describing how he was to coordinate the military efforts between France and the Ottoman Empire: The embassy arrived in Marseille on 3 April 1535 and departed on 11 April 1535 on the Ottoman galleys that had been waiting there. De la Forest departed together on a French galley, La Dauphine. They first stopped at Tunis, where Barbarossa armed a special galley to transport De la Forest to Constantinople. Charles V managed to wreck the plans of Francis I by launching a major attack on the Ottomans with the Conquest of Tunis in June 1535, immediately after the departure of the embassy.Garnier p.94 Concomitantly, Pope Paul III issued an interdiction for Christians to fight between themselves during the time Charles V was fighting the Ottomans, effectively precluding Francis I from launching his offensive. At the same time, Suleiman himself was caught up in a bitter campaign of the Ottoman‚ÄìSafavid War (1532‚Äì1555), which prevented him from participating to offensives in Europe during 1535.

Biography Ceannach's original name is said to have been Gregory, the former name only associated with him after his death. He was a very early Christian missionary who worked in what is now called Connemara in the late 5th/early 6th centuries. He may be associated with the western mission of Saint Patrick. Places associated with im include An Cartr√∫n, Baile na Cille, some three km north of Cleggan. A medieval church set within traces of a rectangular enclosure is dedicated to him. A second church dedicated to him is located on Inishmore, which, according to Previte, \\"is considered to be one of the most ancient and perfect of all the ecclesiastical remains on the island\\" From him is also said to derive the name Gregory's Sound, the sea passage between Inishmore and Inishmaan. Folklore in the parish of Ballinakill states that Ceannach's mission was the first in this part of Ireland, which was still pagan. The tradition stated that this infuriated a local king, who seized him and had him beheaded close to the eastern extremity of Cleggan. Lore has it that he then picked up his head and took it to the Holy Well in Clooncree where he washed it before lying down to die. From this incident the village is supposed to derive its name, although An Cloigeann (meaning head or skull), apparently refers to a coastal headland. Gregory's new name, Ceannach, also seems to be derived from this. A heap of stones pointed out as the site of his death.

Ultrasound avoidance is known for several groups of insects that have independently evolved mechanisms for ultrasonic hearing. Insects have evolved a variety of ultrasound-sensitive ears based upon a vibrating tympanic membrane tuned to sense the bat's echolocating calls. The ultrasonic hearing is coupled to a motor response that causes evasion of the bat during flight. Although ultrasonic signals are used for echolocation by toothed whales, no known examples of ultrasonic avoidance in their prey have been found to date. Ultrasonic hearing has evolved multiple times in insects: a total of 19 times. Bats appeared in the Eocene era, (about 50 million years ago); antibat tactics should have evolved then. Antibat tactics are known in four orders of Insecta: moths (Lepidoptera), crickets (Orthoptera), mantids (Dictyoptera), and green lacewings (Neuroptera). There are hypotheses of ultrasound avoidance being present in Diptera (flies) and Coleoptera (beetles). Ultrasound avoidance in moths The idea that moths were able to hear the cries of echolocating bats dates back to the late 19th century. F. Buchanan White, in an 1877 letter to NatureWhite's reference can be found in the following link: . His question is close to the ending of the letter. made the association between the moth's high-pitched sounds and the high-pitched bat calls and wondered whether the moths would be able to hear it. However, it was not until the early 1960s that Kenneth Roeder et al. made the first electrophysiological recordings of a noctuid moth's auditory nerve and were able to confirm this suspicion. Later research showed that moths responded to ultrasound with evasive movements. Moths, as do crickets and most insects that display bat avoidance behaviors, have tympanic organs that display phonotactic and directional hearing; they fly away from the source of the sound and will only have the diving behavior considered above when the sound is too loud‚Äîor when, in a natural setting, the bat would be presumably too close to simply fly away. It was found that the moths' responses vary according to ultrasound intensity, diving towards the ground if the pulse was of a high amplitude, or flying directly away from the sound source if the sound amplitude was low (if the sound was softer). Acoustic sensory receptors in noctuid moths are mechanoreceptors located in a chamber formed by the wall of the abdomen and the tympanic membrane, are most sensitive to lower frequencies of ultrasound (between 20 and 30 kHz.). The moth's body axis allows it to be more sensitive to sounds coming from particular directions. Their ears, on either side of the metathorax, have two sensory cells within the membranes. Though the tuning curves of these cells are identical, the sensitivity thresholds differ, allowing for sound localization and a wider range of sensitivity to sound. The movement of the wings during flight also plays a role, since sound thresholds change with wing position. The neural mechanisms for triggering the acoustic startle response are partially understood. However, there is little known about the motor control of flight that ultrasound initiates. Further research has shown that many species of moths are sensitive to ultrasound. Sensitivities for ultrasound change according to the environment the moth thrives in, and the moth can even change its own sensitivity if it is preyed upon by bats with different echolocating calls. Such is the case of the Australian noctuid moth, Speiredonia spectans, which adapts its acoustic sensitivity according to the characteristics of the call of the bat inside the cave with them. Ultrasound avoidance in crickets An adult male and a juvenile male of the species Gryllus bimaculatus Crickets are preyed on by bats during the night while they fly from one place to another. Avoidance behaviors by crickets were first reported in 1977 by A. V. Popov and V. F. Shuvalov. They also demonstrated that crickets, like moths, fly away from bats once they've heard their echolocating calls, an example of negative phonotaxis. The cricket will steer itself away from the source of the sound within a very short time frame (40‚Äì80 ms). The response is evoked by brief ultrasonic pulses in the 20 to 100 kHz range, pulses which fall within the range of bat ultrasonic echolocating calls (20‚Äì100 kHz). As opposed to moths, the cricket ear, located in the foreleg, is complex - having 70 receptors that are arranged in a tonotopic fashion. This is understandable since crickets don't only need to listen to bats, but also to each other. Crickets have broad frequency sensitivity to different types of echolocating calls. One specific auditory interneuron, the AN2 interneuron, exhibits remarkably rapid responses to echolocating call stimuli. All these receptors synapse on a far lower number of interneurons that relay the receptors' information to the cricket's central nervous system. In the Teleogryllus cricket, two ascending interneurons carry information to the brain - one carries information about cricket song (around 5 kHz) while the other gets excited at ultrasound and other high frequencies (15‚Äì100 kHz). The ultrasound-sensitive interneuron - labeled INT-1 - has been demonstrated as both necessary and sufficient for negative phonotaxis by Nolen and Hoy in 1984: Stimulating int-1 by current injection is sufficient to initiate negative phonotaxis, while hyperpolarizing int-1 effectively cancels the turning response to ultrasound. Due to this, int-1 has been proposed to be a command neuron of sorts; in the cricket, int-1 is a bat detector when the cricket is in flight and the interneuron's activity reaches a specific threshold. If these conditions are met, the magnitude of the sound is linearly proportional to the magnitude of the avoidance response. This research also demonstrated that the brain is necessary for the response, since decapitated crickets will fly, but show no avoidance response behaviors. Bats may have potentially found ways to get around this system. In the Teleogryllus oceanicus cricket, its broad sensitivity can be circumvented by the use of frequency-mismatched calls by part of bats like the gleaning bat, Nyctophilus geoffroyi. Furthermore, it has been found that the ultrasound avoidance response is restricted to when the crickets are in flight: that is, the response is extinguished when the crickets are on the ground. It has also been shown that short-winged crickets are less sensitive to ultrasound, but not to low frequencies, than their long-winged counterparts in a wing-dimorphic cricket, Grillus texensis. A hormone, named juvenile hormone (JH), is believed to play a role in whether the individual develops shorter or longer wings: if the individual has a higher level of JH, its wings will be shorter. Ultrasound avoidance in other insects In praying mantises, ultrasound avoidance behaviors are non-directional turns or power dives that are very effective in preventing capture by bats. The mantis ear, located in the midline between the metathoracic (third) legs, comprises two tympana within an auditory chamber that enhances sensitivity. A bilaterally symmetrical pair of auditory interneurons, 501-T3, accurately track the ultrasonic calls during the early stages of a bat attack. Because 501-T3 stops firing just before the evasive response starts, it may be involved in triggering the behavior. The praying mantis ear first appeared 120 million years ago, predating the appearance of echolocating bats by c. 50 million years, so its original function must be different from its current one.Yager, D. D. & Svenson, G. J. (2008). \\"A phylogeny of mantis auditory systems based on morphological, molecular, physiological, and behavioral data\\". Biological Journal of the Linnean Society. 94: 541-568. Arctiid moths use a very different, but highly effective defense against bats.Conner, W. E. & Corcoran, A. J. (2012). \\"Sound strategies: the 65-million-year-old battle between bats and insects\\". Annual Review of Entomology. 57: 21-39 They produce loud ultrasonic clicks in response to ultrasound. Depending on the species of moth and its ecology, the clicks may work by startling the bat, by jamming its echolocation system, or by warning of distastefulness (aposematism). Green lacewings (Chrysopidae) have sensitive ears on their wings. Ultrasound causes flying lacewings to fold their wings and drop, an effective maneuver for evading capture by bats.Miller, L. A. (1984). \\"Hearing in green lacewings and their responses to the cries of bats\\". In: Canard, M.; S√©m√©ria, Y.; New, T. R., editors. Biology of Chrysopidae. The Hague: Dr W.

The tunnel provides a link between Kanonersky Island and Dvinskaya Street on Gutuevsky Island. The tunnel was constructed in 1983 by using Immersed tube method.  History and backgrounds Kanonersky Island is an Artificial island in Saint-Petersburg. It was built as consequence of building Sea Canal to further deepening of Neva Bay. By expansion of industrial area of St. Petersburg, it became home to large shipbuilding enterprises. Means of transportation were ferry and private boats and exploiting Icebreaker was mandatory during cold period of year by using Big port Saint Petersburg. Thus connecting this industrial island to the mainland was suggested either by bridge or tunnel, and a tunnel was preferred.  Construction  For the construction of Kanonersky Tunnel, several scientific institutes were involved for design and feasibility studies such as Lengiprotrans,LENMORNIIPROEKT , SKB Glavmostostroy, Research Institute of Transport Construction, PGUPS,MIIT,Metrogiprotrans, Moscow State University of Environmental Engineering. The tunnel project was prepared by Lengiprotrans while the building work was carried out by Giprostroymost. Geodetic maintenance of the building was assigned to the PGUPS. The Tunnel was built using a sunken tube or immersed tube method. The main part consists of five identical prefabricated reinforced concrete sections. Each length is , width , height , weight about . The structure is made of monolithic reinforced concrete with a thickness of the tray, walls and floors of 0.93 m of buried sections ‚Äì The length of the site dipping sections totalled . For the building of the sections on the bank of the Sea Canal, the original dock-sluice was constructed. After sluicing the created sections, the end faces were closed by metal partitions. They were counterbalanced by water and transported along the Sea Canal to the place of immersion. They were then joined to an earlier established section, forming a uniform design. For the control of the immersion, divers worked underwater. The full length of the tunnel was . The tunnel has two lanes and a footpath. Along with cables for electrical supply and communication; water supply and central heating pipes connect Kanonersky Island with the city. Operation Due to nature of Immersed tube method, constant monitoring and repairing has been needed. The first Maintenance, repair and overhaul was carried out between 1997 and 2002. Tasks included lighting, ventilation systems were replaced, three drainage pumps were installed. In 2004, Lengiprotrans, one of the principal contractors, carried out repair work. In 2006, there was a mooring damaged over the tunnel; from it the tunnel was also damaged. At the end of June 2009, tunnel repair was again required, after it was determined that the drainage systems needed a replacement. The most recent Maintenance, repair and overhaul was carried out in December 2017, with the cost of 127 million rubles. Operating speed limit has been a key for longevity and maintenance of the tunnel. A new toll road, the central section of which is still under construction, will soon provide a north-south corridor over the island.

Approximately 300 were built, of which 73 were lost during the war. Four were exported to the Spanish Republican Navy during the Spanish Civil War and others were transferred to North Korea after the war. Three were captured by the Finns, but only two were used before all three had to be returned to the Soviets after the Moscow Armistice in 1944. Design and development The G-5 class was an improved and enlarged version of the s which were derived from a design by Andrei Tupolev, the noted aircraft designer. It was intended to use Soviet-built engines and carry larger torpedoes than its predecessor. A prototype was designed and built by TsAGI ( or \\"Tsentralniy Aerogidrodinamicheskiy Institut\\", the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute) in 1932‚Äì33. As its intended engines were not yet available two Isotta Fraschini engines were imported from Italy. Unarmed, and with a partial fuel load, it achieved a maximum speed of during its trials in the Black Sea during 1933 and the decision was made to place it into production.Breyer, p. 196 The G-5 was a single-step, hydroplaning design with a whaleback upper hull. It was mainly built from duralumin which saved a significant amount of weight, but greatly complicated its use in service because of duralumin's susceptibility to galvanic corrosion in salt water. One captured Soviet torpedo boat commander said that G-5s could only be kept in the water for 5‚Äì7 days during the summer and 10‚Äì15 days during the winter before it had to be removed from the water and treated with anti-corrosion measures. The hull was divided into three compartments by two transverse bulkheads. The superstructure was very small to reduce top-heaviness, and crewmembers could not stand up inside it.Breyer, pp. 196‚Äì97 The G-5 was designed to use a version of the Mikulin AM-34 aircraft engine adapted for maritime use as the GAM-34. The two engines were fitted in the forward compartment of the hull. Each engine had its own transmission and drove a bronze propeller in diameter. The initial version of the GAM-34 was less powerful than planned at only and the initial Series 7 boats could only reach . However the minimum speed was which caused a great deal of trouble when trying to moor and when maneuvering in close proximity.Breyer, p. 197 The two torpedoes were carried in troughs set into the rear deck in a manner derived from that used by the British WW I-era coastal motor boats captured by the Soviets during Russian Civil War. The torpedoes were shoved out the back of the trough by an arbor with a bell- shaped head that was activated by an explosive charge, but the torpedo motor was not activated until a wire trailing from the boat snapped, giving the boat time to turn away from the target.Bryer, pp. 279‚Äì80 This launching system was very light, but it required additional training to properly aim the torpedo and prior coordination when making massed torpedo attacks to prevent the boats from ramming each other or the torpedoes. The gun armament initially consisted of a single machine gun, but this was upgraded to a DShK machine gun in later models. Some later boats carried two DShKs although the mounts varied; some were placed in a tub in the forecastle, but others carried theirs in a rotating turret behind the superstructure, above the torpedoes.Breyer, pp. 197‚Äì201 Some boats carried ROFS-82 or ROFS-132 rocket launchers in fixed mounts above and behind the wheelhouse.Conway's, p. 342 Production Approximately 300 G-5s were built. 152 of the Series 7, 8 and 9 boats were built between 1934 and 1936. 20 Series 10 boats were built in 1937, another 76 in 1938‚Äì39 and five in 1939‚Äì40. 39 Series 11 boats were built beginning in 1941 and production may have continued during the war.Breyer, p. 200 G-5 Variants Series 7 :They weighed at standard load, had an overall length of and drew of water.

The Baltic Fleet had 60, the Black Sea Fleet had 92, the Pacific Fleet had 135 and the Caspian Flotilla had six. During the war 73 were lost in action and 31 were scrapped after becoming unserviceable. By the end of the war in 1945 24 were in service with the Baltic Fleet, 134 were with the Pacific Fleet and six were still with the Caspian Flotilla. Many of the Soviet G-5s were used for different roles (landing units, transports, escorts, etc..) and saw a relatively low numbers of torpedo attacks against enemy targets. In Baltic Sea TK-94 scored the locally significant sinking of Finnish minelayer . The only other known sinking caused by G-5s in Baltic Sea was the German minesweeper M37.http://www.navypedia.org/ships/germany/ger_mine_35_39mob.htm Likewise, few victories were scored in Black Sea. During the Crimean Offensive, on the night of 27 April, three G-5s attacked and crippled the German submarine hunter UJ-104 near Sevastopol. The Romanian gunboat opened fire with tracer rounds, enabling several more warships to locate the three boats and begin firing, resulting in one of the G-5s being sunk. UJ-104 was towed to Sevastopol and later sunk by Soviet aircraft.Nicolae Koslinski, Raymond StƒÉnescu, Marina rom√¢nƒÉ in al doilea rƒÉzboi mondial: 1942-1944 (in Romanian)Jipa Rotaru, Ioan Damaschin, Glorie »ôi dramƒÉ: Marina RegalƒÉ Rom√¢nƒÉ, 1940-1945 (in Romanian) Later, some G-5s sank the already damaged and abandoned Romanian minelayer Romania.http://www.navypedia.org/ships/romania/ro_cm_amc2.htm On 18 November 1942 the Finnish motor torpedo boat Sy√∂ksy, the captured G-5 boats Vinha and Vihuri, as well as a minelaying KM-boat, attacked Soviet ships in the harbour of Lavansaari. Sy√∂ksy sank the , although she was later raised and put back into service. Exports Four boats were transferred to the Spanish Republican Navy during the Spanish Civil War, two continue in service after the war in the Spanish Nationalist navy until 1946. A number were transferred by the Soviet Union to North Korea after the end of the war.

Estelle, 503 F. Supp. 1265 (S.D. Tex. 1980), filed in United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, eventually became the most far-reaching lawsuit on the conditions of prison incarceration in American history. It began as a civil action, a handwritten petition filed against the Texas Department of Corrections (TDC) in 1972 by inmate David Resendez Ru√≠z alleging that the conditions of his incarceration, such as overcrowding, lack of access to health care, and abusive security practices, were a violation of his constitutional rights. In 1974, the petition was joined by seven other inmates and became a class action suit known as Ruiz v. Estelle, 550 F.2d 238. The trial ended in 1979 with the ruling that the conditions of imprisonment within the TDC prison system constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the United States Constitution, with the original report issued in 1980, a 118-page decision by Judge William Justice (Ruiz v. Estelle, 503 F.Supp. 1295). The decision led to federal oversight of the system, with a prison construction boom and \\"sweeping reforms ... that fundamentally changed how Texas prisons operated.\\" David Resendez Ru√≠z David Resendez Ru√≠z was a Mexican-American from East Austin, Texas.Perkinson, Robert. Texas Tough: The Rise of America's Prison Empire. First Edition. Metropolitan Books, 2010. p. 253. .Perkinson, Robert. Texas Tough: The Rise of America's Prison Empire. First Edition. Metropolitan Books, 2010. p. 257. . The son of migrant farmworkers and the youngest of 13 children, he got into trouble with the law from an early age; as a child he was arrested for fighting and shoplifting. After an arrest for a car theft, 12-year-old Ru√≠z received a sentence to serve time in Gatesville State School in Gatesville; he arrived for his first session in 1954. In Gatesville he socialized with \\"hard core\\" state school students from Austin and San Antonio. Ru√≠z had four sessions in Gatesville. After Ru√≠z left Gatesville for the final time, he turned 17, which made him an adult in the Texas penal system.Perkinson, Robert. Texas Tough: The Rise of America's Prison Empire. First Edition. Metropolitan Books, 2010. p. 254. . After another car theft, he was sentenced to serve time in the Texas Department of Corrections (TDC). He initially was placed in Huntsville; two weeks later he was assigned to the Ramsey Farm in Brazoria County, Texas, where he worked in fields. In Ramsey, Ru√≠z attempted to kill an inmate that he believed was planning to have Ru√≠z killed; the stabbing injured but did not kill the prisoner. The prison authorities beat Ru√≠z as a punishment. During his confinement in Ramsey, Ru√≠z had also committed lesser infractions. His first adult sentence lasted seven years. After he left prison, Ru√≠z married a woman named Rose Marie and the two had a daughter together.Perkinson, Robert. Texas Tough: The Rise of America's Prison Empire. First Edition. Metropolitan Books, 2010. p. 255. . Thirteen months after his release, on July 1968, Ru√≠z was again placed in the custody of the TDC; he said that he had \\"picked up the gun\\" because he had no education or trade skills to support himself and his family. He was then assigned to the Eastham Unit in Houston County, where he continued to work in fields. While at Eastham, Ru√≠z participated in a failed escape attempt. The warden of Eastham and George Beto, the TDC director, escorted Ru√≠z back to prison. After a week in the infirmary, Ru√≠z was placed in solitary confinement for 45 days; there he decided to become a prison activist.Perkinson, Robert. Texas Tough: The Rise of America's Prison Empire. First Edition. Metropolitan Books, 2010. p. 256. . After Ru√≠z left solitary confinement, he refused to work in the fields any longer and cut his achilles tendon with a razor. Because of the self-inflicted injuries, Ru√≠z was no longer required to work, and he was sent to various correctional and medical facilities. Ru√≠z had committed many disciplinary infractions, including the stabbing, the escape attempt, and the refusal to work, so he was sent to the Wynne Unit, where he met Fred Cruz, a prisoner who filed successful lawsuits against the prison system. At the Wynne Unit, Ru√≠z, Cruz, and other prisoners worked together to file lawsuits against TDC.Perkinson, Robert. Texas Tough: The Rise of America's Prison Empire. First Edition. Metropolitan Books, 2010. p. 260. . Subsequent litigation There followed a long period of further litigation in the form of consent decrees, appeals and other legal actions, until a final judgment was rendered in 1992. But problems in enforcement continued, and in 1996 U.S. Congress enacted the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) to address these issues as well as abuse of the prison litigation process. However, in October 1997, the district court, still not satisfied with the compliance of the TDC, gave permission for continuing site visits by attorneys and experts for the inmate class, and this continued into 1999. In response to this, the TDC issued more than 450,000 pages of evidence and accepted 50 additional site visits. In 2001, the court found that the TDC was in compliance on the issue of use of force against inmates and had adequate policies and procedures in place. However, the court continued to have issues with the \\"current and ongoing constitutional violations regarding administrative segregation [in] the conditions of confinement and the practice of using administrative segregation to house mentally ill inmates\\" that it found. In 2007, in the consolidated case of Jones v. Bock the U.S. Supreme Court, in a unanimous decision, set forth limitations on the extent of prison litigation. See also *Trusty system *Gates v.

The ADE 651 is a fake bomb detector produced by the British company Advanced Tactical Security & Communications Ltd (ATSC). The deception and its discovery ATSC claimed that the device could, from long range, effectively and accurately detect various types of explosives, drugs, ivory, and other substances. The device has been sold to 20 countries in the Middle East and Asia, including Iraq and Afghanistan, for as much as US$60,000 each. The Iraqi government is said to have spent ¬£52 million on the devices. Investigations by the BBC and other organisations found that the device is little more than a \\"glorified dowsing rod\\" with no detecting ability. In January 2010, export of the device was banned by the British government and the managing director of ATSC was arrested on suspicion of fraud; in June 2010, several other companies were raided by British police. ATSC was dissolved on 5 March 2013. On 23 April 2013, the founder of ATSC, James \\"Jim\\" McCormick, was convicted of three counts of fraud and subsequently sentenced to ten years' imprisonment. The use of the device by Iraqi and Pakistani security forces has become a major international controversy. The very similar GT200 and Alpha 6 devices, widely used in Thailand and Mexico, also came under scrutiny in the wake of the revelations about the ADE 651. The device An Iraqi soldier in 2008 using an ADE 651 The ADE 651 consists of a swivelling antenna mounted via hinge to a plastic handgrip. It requires no battery or other power source; its manufacturer claimed that it is powered solely by the user's static electricity. To use the device, the operator must walk for a few moments to \\"charge\\" it before holding it at right angles to the body. After a substance-specific \\"programmed substance detection card\\" is inserted, the device is supposed to swivel in the user's hand to point its antenna in the direction of the target substance. The cards are claimed to be designed to \\"tune into\\" the \\"frequency\\" of a particular explosive or other substance named on the card. Husam Muhammad, an Iraqi police officer and user of the ADE 651, described the proper use of the device as more of an art than a science. \\"If we are tense, the device doesn't work correctly. I start slow, and relax my body, and I try to clear my mind.\\" The cards were supposedly \\"programmed\\" or \\"activated\\" by being placed in a jar for a week along with a sample of the target substance to absorb the substance's \\"vapours\\". Initially, McCormick reportedly used his own blood to \\"program\\" the cards for detecting human tissue, but eventually gave up even the pretense of \\"programming\\" them when demand for the devices was at its peak. Promotional material issued by ATSC claimed that the ADE 651 could detect such item as guns, ammunition, drugs, truffles, human bodies, contraband ivory and bank notes at distances of up to , underground, through walls, underwater or even from aircraft at an altitude of up to . In a promotional video, McCormick claimed that the device could detect elephants from away. The ADE 651 was said to work on the principle of \\"electrostatic magnetic ion attraction\\". According to the promotional material, \\"by programming the detection cards to specifically target a particular substance, (through the proprietary process of electrostatic matching of the ionic charge and structure of the substance), the ADE651 could \\"by-pass\\" all known attempts to conceal the target substance. It has been claimed to penetrate lead, concrete, and other materials (including hiding in the body) used in attempts to block the attraction.\\" Prosec, a Lebanese reseller of the ADE 651, claimed on its website that the device works on nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). McCormick told the BBC in 2010 that \\"the theory behind dowsing and the theory behind how we actually detect explosives is very similar\\". Development and manufacture The ADE 651 is a descendant of the Quadro Tracker Positive Molecular Locator produced in the 1990s by Wade Quattlebaum, an American car dealer, commercial diver and treasure hunter. The Quadro Tracker was promoted by Quattlebaum initially as a device to find lost golfballs, and later as a means of detecting marijuana, cocaine, heroin, gunpowder, and dynamite using \\"carbo-crystalised\\" software cards. Like the ADE 651, it consisted of a hand unit on which a swinging antenna was mounted, linked to a box worn on the belt in which the cards were inserted to identify the \\"molecular frequency\\" of whatever the user wanted to detect. The cards were \\"programmed\\" by photocopying a Polaroid photograph of the target, cutting up the resulting copy and pasting the pieces between two squares of plastic. Quattlebaum sold the devices at prices of between $395 and $8,000 for a unit claimed to be capable of detecting humans, using a Polaroid photograph of the individual concerned for the \\"programming.\\" A cheaper variant called the Golfinder or Gopher was available for $69. Although the Quadro Tracker was enjoined from being manufactured or sold in the United States after a 1996 federal court case, Quadro's four principal figures escaped criminal sanctions after a jury failed to convict them. The company's secretary, Malcolm Stig Roe, moved to the United Kingdom after jumping bail and set up two new companies to sell fake detection devices. Some of the distribution agents broke away and began producing their own copies of the Quadro Tracker, such as the Alpha 6, Mole Programmable Substance Detector, Sniffex and GT200. The huge increase in security spending that followed the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States opened up lucrative opportunities for sellers of security equipment. The ADE 651's inventor Jim McCormick, a former Merseyside Police officer, was previously a salesman specialising in communications equipment but had no scientific or technical background. He established a private limited company (registered company 03407495) on 23 July 1997 under the name \\"Broadcasting and Telecommunications Ltd\\" which he subsequently renamed \\"Advanced Tactical Security & Communications Ltd\\" (ATSC).Companies House records for registered companies 03407495 and 06797101. Retrieved 24 January 2010 After he came across the Mole in 2000, McCormick signed up as a distribution agent, paying the UK-based manufacturer ¬£10,000 for a single unit. The device was withdrawn from sale only a year later after it was investigated by Sandia National Laboratories on behalf of the US National Law Enforcement and Corrections Technology Center, and was found to be useless. The company was based in a former dairy in Sparkford, Somerset. QEDcon 2016. McCormick responded to this setback by copying Quadro's Golfinder, sticking an ATSC label onto it, renaming it the ADE (Advanced Detection Equipment) 100, and marketing it as a bomb detector. A subsequent revision of the design, called the ADE 101, was sold for up to $7,000 per unit. He also marketed a version called the ADE 650. The ADE 651 was a further development of the same design. According to an associate of ATSC, the devices were manufactured at a cost of ¬£150 each by suppliers in Great Britain and Romania. The associate told The New York Times: \\"Everyone at ATSC knew there was nothing inside the ADE 651.\\" A whistleblower who worked with McCormick to sell the device around the world told the BBC that he once challenged McCormick over the device's effectiveness. McCormick was said to have answered that the device did \\"exactly what it's meant to ... it makes money.\\" ATSC was the principal vendor of the ADE devices. Its accounts at Companies House recorded a turnover of ¬£1.78 million for the year to 31 July 2008, with a gross profit of ¬£1.35 million. Its sole shareholder was its owner, McCormick. A sister company at the same location, ATSC Exports Ltd (registered company 06797101), was established on 21 January 2009, also as a private limited company. It had not filed any accounts as of January 2010. There were also several resellers of ATSC's fake bomb detectors, including Cumberland Industries UK, a company based in Kettering, Northamptonshire, and Prosec of Baabda, Lebanon. Users The ADE 651 is widely used by the Iraqi Police Service and the Iraqi Army. The Iraqi Interior Ministry bought 800 of the devices in 2008 for ¬£20m and a further 700 in 2009 for ¬£32m, in no-bid contracts with ATSC. The Iraqi government paid up to ¬£37,000 for the devices despite the purchase price being put at around ¬£11,500. The Iraqi Army's Baghdad Operations Command announced in November 2009 that it had purchased another hundred of the devices. McCormick of ATSC has said that the devices were sold for ¬£5,000 each, with the balance of the cost going on training and middlemen. The training included instructions to Iraqi users to \\"shuffle their feet to generate static electricity to make the things work.\\" Iraqi Interior Minister Jawad al-Bulani, who defended the use of the ADE 651. The ADE 651 has been used at hundreds of Iraqi police and Iraqi military checkpoints across the country, often replacing physical inspections of vehicles. Major-General Jihad al-Jabiri of the Interior Ministry's General Directorate for Combating Explosives has defended the device: \\"Whether it's magic or scientific, what I care about is detecting bombs. I don't care what they say. I know more about bombs than the Americans do. In fact, I know more about bombs than anyone in the world.\\" He told a press conference that the ADE 651 has detected \\"hundreds of roadside bombs and car bombs\\" and any deficiencies were due to defective training in the device's use. The Iraqi Interior Minister, Jawad al-Bulani, also defended the device, telling Al Iraqiya television that the ADE 651 had \\"managed to prevent and detect more than 16,000 bombs that would be a threat to people's life and more than 733 car bombs were defused.\\" He said: \\"Iraq is considered as a market area for many companies producing such devices ... and there are other rival companies trying to belittle the efficiency of these instruments the government is buying\\". In Mexico, the Government of Colima bought an ADE 651 for more than $60,000. Also, in the photography accompanying an article about the GT200 published in newspaper La-Ch.com, a Mexican soldier can be seen using an ADE 651. It is possible that the Secretariat of National Defense (SEDENA) also bought some units. According to a promotional website for the ADE 651, the device is also used by the Lebanese Army, the Chinese Police, the Royal Thai Police and the Interior Ministry of the Kurdistan Regional Government in Iraqi Kurdistan. The website claims that the Jordanian government requires hotels to employ ADE 651 devices to scan vehicles entering underground car parks. ATSC's McCormick says that 20 countries have acquired the device, with purchasers including \\"the Saudis, Indian police, a Belgian drug squad, a Hong Kong correctional facility and the Chittagong navy.\\" The police in the Belgian municipal region of Geel-Laakdal-Meerhout use the device to detect drugs. Pakistan's Airport Security Force also uses the ADE 651 as a bomb detector at the Jinnah International Airport in Karachi. Effectiveness The use of the ADE 651 has prompted strong criticism and eventually led to a ban on the device's export from the UK to Iraq and Afghanistan and a criminal investigation of its manufacturer. The Iraqi security forces' reliance on the device was highlighted by The New York Times investigation in November 2009, which reported that United States military and technical experts believed the device was useless. US Army Major-General Richard Rowe told the newspaper that \\"there's [no] magic wand that can detect explosives. If there was, we would all be using it. I have no confidence that these work.\\" Sandia National Laboratories had carried out testing of several similar devices but found that \\"none have ever performed better than random chance.\\" Retired US Air Force Colonel Hal Bidlack, a former national security aide in the Clinton and Bush administrations, condemned the device as \\"laughable, except someone down the street from you is counting on this to keep bombs off the streets.\\" An Iraqi guard and driver for The New York Times, both of whom were licensed to carry firearms, were able to drive two AK-47 rifles and ammunition through nine police checkpoints that were using the device without any of them detecting the weapons. Iraqi civilians have complained that the device seems to have \\"an unerring attraction to shampoo and soapsuds\\". According to Iraqi police officer Jasim Hussein, \\"The vast majority of the people we stop, it's because of their perfume\\". A fellow officer, Hasan Ouda, commented that \\"Most people now understand it's what gets them searched, so they don't use as much.\\" McCormick of ATSC falsely claimed that the apparent responsiveness of the ADE 651 was due to fragrances containing traces of the explosive substance RDX. The veteran Canadian- American magician and skeptic James Randi has publicly offered one million dollars to anyone who can prove the device's effectiveness as far back as October 2008. Randi issued a statement calling the ADE 651 \\"a useless quack device which cannot perform any other function than separating naive persons from their money. It's a fake, a scam, a swindle, and a blatant fraud. Prove me wrong and take the million dollars.\\" According to Randi, nobody from ATSC has responded. The German news magazine Der Spiegel reported that the ADE 651 had been tested around 2008 in Israel but was \\"kicked out of the country\\". An Israeli explosives expert told the magazine: \\"The thing has absolutely nothing to do with the detection of explosives.\\" When it was displayed at an arms and security fair in Beirut in April 2009, a visiting explosives expert described it as \\"one big fraud\\". Gadi Aviran, the head of the Israeli security firm Terrorgence, said: \\"If someone comes to an expert, claiming that he had developed a device that can detect the smell of explosives from several meters away, the expert must know that this is physically not possible.\\" The FBI has repeatedly issued alerts about dowsing rod devices being used as explosive detectors. It described one such device, the Quadro Tracker, as \\"a fraud\\" and told all agencies to immediately cease using it. Another alert issued in 1999 told agencies: \\"Warning. Do not use bogus explosives detection devices.\\" A US Army test of a similar device found that it was unable to detect a truck carrying a tonne of TNT when it drove up behind the operator. In June 2009, the US Army carried out a laboratory test including X-ray analysis on the ADE 651 that found it to be ineffective. According to Major Joe Scrocca, \\"The examination resulted in a determination that there was no possible means by which the ADE 651 could detect explosives and therefore was determined to be totally ineffective and fraudulent. As a result of that study, the US military notified all military and civilian personnel in Iraq that the bomb detection device is ineffective and should not be relied upon as a means of ensuring the safety of any personnel.\\" Caroline Hawley and Meirion Jones from the BBC's Newsnight programme investigated the ADE 651 in a report broadcast in January 2010, asking the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory to assess one of the \\"programmed substance detection cards\\" used in the device to detect TNT. The laboratory found that the card contained only a standard radio frequency security tag of the type used in stores to prevent shoplifting. According to the laboratory's Dr. Markus Kuhn, it was \\"impossible\\" for the card to detect anything and it had \\"absolutely nothing to do with the detection of TNT\\". The card could not be programmed, had no memory, no microprocessor and no form of information could be stored on it. Despite the high cost of the devices, the cards were worth only about two to three pence (3‚Äì5¬¢) each. Kuhn commented: \\"These are the cheapest bit of electronics that you can get that look vaguely electronic and are sufficiently flat to fit inside a card.\\" The \\"card reader\\" was found to be an empty plastic box. Psychology professor Bruce Hood has noted that the swinging of the antenna is merely due to its loose assembly and unconscious wrist movements by the user (ideomotor phenomenon). Explosives expert Sidney Alford described the device as \\"immoral\\", telling Newsnight that \\"it could result in people being killed in the dozens, if not hundreds\\". Newsnight noted that thousands of people had indeed been killed and injured in devastating car bomb attacks in Baghdad such as the 25 October and 8 December 2009 Baghdad bombings, without the bombers being detected by the ADE 651 devices. McCormick refused to be interviewed for the Newsnight investigation, but told The New York Times that ATSC would remain in business: \\"Our company is still fully operational.\\" He told The Times that ATSC had been dealing with doubters for ten years and that the device was merely being criticised because of its \\"primitive\\" appearance. He said: \\"We are working on a new model that has flashing lights.\\" Investigations and export ban United Kingdom British and American military officers in Iraq brought the ADE 651's ineffectiveness to the attention of British police liaison officers in the country. The matter subsequently came to the notice of Colin Port, the Chief Constable of the Avon and Somerset Constabulary and Chair of the International Police Assistance Board, who personally ordered an investigation into McCormick and ATSC.\\"PM\\". BBC Radio 4, 2 May 2013 In January 2010, ATSC's McCormick was arrested on suspicion of fraud. On 12 July 2012, McCormick was charged on three counts that between 15 January 2007, and 12 July 2012, he had in his possession or control an article for use in the course of or in connection with fraud contrary to Section 6 of the Fraud Act 2006; and three further charges that between the same dates he made or adapted, supplied or offered to supply an article knowing it was designed or adapted for use in the course of or in connection with, or intending it to be used to commit, or to assist in a fraud, contrary to Section 7 of the Fraud Act 2006. Following the 2010 BBC Newsnight expos√© of the device, the UK Government's Department for Business, Innovation and Skills announced that the BBC tests had shown that \\"the technology used in the ADE 651 and similar devices is not suitable for bomb detection\\" and they \\"could cause harm to UK and other friendly forces in Iraq and Afghanistan\\". It had therefore decided to ban the export of the ADE 651 and similar devices to those two countries under the Export Control Act 2002, with effect from 27 January 2010. The device had not previously been subject to export restrictions as it was non-military equipment. The department offered \\"cooperation with any investigation [the Iraqi authorities] may wish to make into how the device came to be bought for their military as bomb detection equipment.\\" The banning order prohibited the export to Iraq and Afghanistan of \\"'electro-statically powered' equipment for detecting 'explosives'\\". McCormick was tried in March‚ÄìApril 2013 at the Central Criminal Court in London. The court was told that \\"the devices did not work and he knew they did not work. He had them manufactured so that they could be sold ‚Äì and despite the fact they did not work, people bought them for a handsome but unwarranted profit.\\" McCormick had falsely represented himself as a member of the International Association of Bomb Technicians and Investigators, using the organisation's logo without permission. McCormick said that he had sold the ADE 651 and similar devices to security forces internationally but none had complained about them. On 23 April 2013, McCormick was convicted on three counts of fraud. The chief investigating officer in the case, Detective Superintendent Nigel Rock, said: It was disclosed that McCormick had made millions of pounds from sales of the ADE 651, with which he had bought a farmhouse in Somerset, Nicolas Cage's former ¬£3.5 million house in Bath with its own basement swimming pool, holiday homes in Cyprus and Florida, a ¬£600,000 luxury yacht, and three horses for one of his daughters. The police declared that they would seek to \\"pursue his wealth\\" using the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. McCormick was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment on 2 May 2013. In passing sentence, Mr. Richard Hone said: \\"Your fraudulent conduct in selling so many useless devices for simply enormous profit promoted a false sense of security and in all probability materially contributed to causing death and injury to innocent individuals.\\" The judge noted that McCormick had not expressed any remorse or recognition of wrongdoing and said that his \\"culpability as a fraudster has to be placed in the highest category.\\" Brigadier Simon Marriner told the court that the ADE 651 was clearly implicated in failing to prevent bomb attacks: \\"The inescapable conclusion is that devices have been detonated after passing through checkpoints. Iraqi civilians have died as a result.\\" McCormick's application for an appeal against his sentence was rejected by the Court of Appeal, with Judge Elgan Edwards stating: \\"The circumstances were quite appalling. The applicant knew precisely what he was doing. He did it for enormous profit and that conduct simply cannot and will not be tolerated.\\" The judge commented that \\"if this case does not merit the maximum possible sentence, I don't know what does.\\" McCormick was subsequently ordered to forfeit ¬£7,944,834 under a proceeds of crime order to recompense the organisations defrauded by him, including ¬£2.3 million to repay Iraq. Iraq Nouri al-Maliki, the former Prime Minister of Iraq. The failure of the ADE 651 to prevent a series of bombings in Baghdad and the circumstances of its procurement raised concerns in Iraq even before it became the subject of media expos√©s. The New York Times reported in November 2009 that Aqeel al-Turaihi, the Iraqi Interior Ministry's inspector- general, had begun an investigation into the contracts that the ministry had signed with ATSC. The Prime Minister of Iraq, Nouri al-Maliki, also ordered an investigation into the effectiveness of the devices following several bomb attacks. The Iraqi parliament did not order an official investigation but Iraqi MP Nadeem al-Jabiri said: \\"the security and defence committee in the parliament, headed by Hadi al-Amiri, is following up this matter as part of the parliament's duty as a monitoring entity.\\" The Interior Ministry's report noted that \\"many lives have been lost due to the wands' utter ineffectiveness\\". The report and investigation were later suppressed, and it has been alleged that corruption was the reason, as 75% of the value of the contract \\"went to kickbacks received by [Iraqi] officials\\". The BBC's revelations in January 2010 caused outrage in Iraq. A police officer told The New York Times: \\"Our government is to be blamed for all the thousands of innocent spirits who were lost since these devices have been used in Iraq.\\" MP Ammar Tuma of the Iraqi Parliament's Security and Defense Committee said: \\"This company not only caused grave and massive losses of funds, but it has caused grave and massive losses of the lives of innocent Iraqi civilians, by the hundreds and thousands, from attacks that we thought we were immune to because we have this device.\\" He told the Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper: \\"The tasks of the committee are limited to two tracks, [and that is] reaching the truth over what happened with regards to the signing of the contracts for these bomb detection devices; firstly by following up on the details of the contract and looking at the background of this, as well as the possibility of collusion by those who signed this contract, or whether this [ineffectiveness] is the result of technical weaknesses in these devices. Either of these [options] deserves accountability.\\" He said that Defence Minister Abd al-Qadr Muhammed Jassim al-Obaidi had informed the Iraqi Parliament during emergency parliamentary hearings in 2009 that \\"the detection of car bombs and explosive material using these devices is very limited, and this increases the likelihood that these devices have low efficiency.\\" Another MP, Hussain al- Falluji, demanded that Iraqi security forces immediately cease using the ADE 651. His proposal to establish an investigative committee and seek to recover the money spent on the devices was supported by other parliamentarians. Hadi Al-Ameri, the head of the Parliament's Security and Defense Committee, said that he would push for an official investigation to \\"find out how this piece of equipment was sold to Iraq.\\" If it was determined that ATSC was responsible he planned to \\"seek compensation via the ministry of foreign affairs.\\" MP Haneen Kado said: \\"If we rely on these devices there is no point in having checkpoints. It makes the whole of Baghdad open to terrorist attacks. We are in a dangerous situation and there could be new bombings at any time. We must investigate exactly who bought and sold these detectors and see that they answer in court.\\" The Supreme Board of Audit in Iraq announced an investigation into the procurement of the ADE 651, focusing on the officials who had previously given assurances of the device's technical soundness. The Iraqi Army's Baghdad Operations Command, which had previously procured 100 of the devices, distanced itself from their use. Major General Qassim al-Moussawi said: \\"The devices have helped us in parts of our work but in some aspects they are not useful. Their performance does not match our aspirations. There is some percent of error in their performance and these devices must be updated.\\" Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki was reported to have ordered a new investigation of how the devices had been procured, looking into whether there was any corruption involved. According to the Iraqi Interior Ministry's inspector-general Aqil al-Turehi, he had investigated the device in 2008 but found it \\"inoperative\\" and costly and recommended that Iraq should not buy it. He told Reuters: \\"There was corruption associated with this contract and we referred to this and submitted our report to the Minister of the Interior. We said that the company which you made a contract with is not well-regarded internationally in the field of explosives detectors, and the price is very high and not commensurate with the abilities of this device.\\" Al-Turehi said that the buying process had been \\"marred by suspicions over the equipment and the efficiency and value of the contracts. There were senior officials involved in these transactions.\\" The initial investigation found that it could detect some bombs and the ministry went ahead with the contract despite al- Turehi's concerns. An unnamed Iraqi officer told the Agence France-Presse that \\"We know it doesn't work and that it has been banned [in Britain], but we are continuing to use it. It is bullshit. But still we are lying about it.\\" Despite the controversy, the device continued to be used at checkpoints across Iraq. The Iraqi Interior Ministry has defended the continued use of the ADE 651. In 2010, the then-head of the ministry's counter-explosives unit, General Jihad al-Jabiri, told the BBC that his organisation had \\"conducted several tests on them, and found them successful. In addition, we have a series of achievements officially documented by the Baghdad operations centre, from all the provinces, which establish that these devices detected thousands of bombs, booby-trapped houses and car bombs, and we've noticed a reduction of bombing activities to less than 10 per cent of what it was.\\" A senior ministry official, Assistant Deputy Minister General Tareq al-Asl, told Asharq Al- Awsat: \\"The reason the director of the company was arrested was not because the device doesn't work, but because he refused to divulge the secret of how it works to the British authorities, and the Americans before them. I have tested it in practice and it works effectively and 100% reliably.\\" In February 2011, General al-Jabiri was arrested on corruption charges, centering on the ADE 651 device purchase. He was subsequently convicted of taking millions of dollars of bribes from McCormick and was imprisoned along with two other Iraqi officials. Up to 15 Iraqis are said to have been on McCormick's payroll, receiving money through a bank in Beirut. Aqil al-Turehi said that he \\"feel[s] furious when I think that this gang of Jim McCormick and the Iraqis working with him killed my people by creating false security and selling such a useless device\\". In one incident, a vehicle carrying rockets and missiles travelled undetected through 23 Baghdad checkpoints equipped with the ADE 651. The false sense of security provided by the device had catastrophic effects for many Iraqi people, hundreds of whom were killed in bombings that the ADE 651 failed to prevent. The victim of one such bombing, 21-year-old Haneen Alwan, told the BBC that her life had been destroyed after she was caught in a bomb attack which caused injuries that killed her unborn child and prompted her husband to divorce her because of her extensive burns, which have so far required her to undergo 59 operations. She said: \\"When people passed through checkpoints using these devices, they thought they would be safe. But they are useless. The man who sold them has no conscience. He is morally bankrupt. How could he sell them just for money and destroy other people's lives?\\" Fake bomb detectors such as the ADE 651 were still in use in Iraq as late as July 2016, and may have contributed to the July 2016 Baghdad bombings. This led to Iraq's Prime Minister, Haider al-Abadi, to order police to stop using the detectors. Pakistan Pakistan purchased ADE 651s for use by the Airports Security Force (ASF). After the ADE 651 became the focus of controversy for its role in Iraq, concerns were raised in Pakistan about its employment as a bomb detector by the ASF. A senior official at Jinnah International Airport denied that the ADE 651 was being used, claiming that the ASF had designed the device in use there, but other ASF officials acknowledged that their device \\"operated on the same principle as ADE-651.\\" Sources claim that Device similar to ADE is made in Pakistan and is in use by Pakistan army. Source also found that these devices are working and have helped in catching 46 guns in different locations at different times. Source also visited an army checkpost on Kohat Highway with a 9mm pistol which was successfully detected by Army Personal. On the other hand, Pakistani scientists rejected the scientific basis on which the device was claimed to work; Professor Shahid Zaidi of Karachi University told the Pakistani newspaper Dawn that \\"there has to be an electric, magnetic or electromagnetic field for a device to work in such a manner. Furthermore static fields don‚Äôt move around the way it is being claimed by some. Also don‚Äôt forget that there are so many radio waves of different frequencies all around us. I just don‚Äôt see how this device would work.\\" Dawn challenged the ASF to test the device to confirm its effectiveness but the ASF refused, insisting that the device works. Belgium The Belgian police bought an ADE 651 in 2008 for ¬£12,800 to detect drugs, as a supposedly cheaper alternative to a dog. According to Superintendent Theiry Meunier, it was soon apparent that it was ineffective: \\"We had no results from it. We tried to use the device for detecting drugs in cars for several months. We also provided the detector to detectives seeking to detect drugs. The results again were negative.\\" Lebanon The Lebanese Army bought ADE 651s. In addition, the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) bought five ADE 651s at a cost of ¬£46,000 to detect explosives in vehicles. ATSC offered the UN a further 80 of the devices, but declined to provide evidence that the ADE 651 could do what was claimed and suggested that the UN should carry out its own tests. UNIFIL did so over the course of two days but found that the device was \\"not fit for purpose\\". Other countries The ADE 651 was also sold to customers in Algeria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Georgia, India, Iran, Kenya, Niger, Qatar, Romania, Tunisia, Saudi Arabia, Syria, the United Arab Emirates and Vietnam. The M√∂venpick Hotel in Bahrain bought one to detect car bombs but, according to the hotel's head of security, who gave evidence to the Old Bailey trial, it could not even detect a firework: \\"It wasn‚Äôt working. It wasn‚Äôt working at all\\". The M√∂venpick hotel ceased using the device following the intervention of the Bahrain Ministry of Interior in mid 2010 at the beginning of an enquiry in co-operation with UK Police which continued until the trial of McCormick in April 2013. Similar devices Another \\"remote substance detector\\" device, the Global Technical GT200, has come under scrutiny in Thailand in the wake of the controversy over the ADE 651. The Bangkok Post reports that the GT200 is virtually identical to the ADE 651 and has been described by critics as a \\"divining rod\\" which uses \\"controller cards\\", like the ADE 651, to find explosives. The Post attributes the death of several Royal Thai Police officers to its repeated failures to detect explosives. The Quadro Tracker, also known as the Positive Molecular Locator, was a similar device sold by Quadro Corp. of Harleyville, South Carolina between 1993 and 1996. Several other similar long range locator devices are being marketed in various countries, including the HEDD1 (formerly known as Sniffex Plus), marketed by Unival in Germany; Alpha 6, marketed by ComsTrac in the UK; PSD-22; and H3Tec. An apparent recycling of the Quadro Tracker turned up as the DKLabs Lifeguard, which had a similar appearance and made ambitious claims about being able to locate survivors missing under rubble or hiding in shipping containers. It has been proven to be useless in tests by Sandia National Labs.

The episode's teleplay was written by Scott Peters, with story credit going to Johnson and Peters. Yves Simoneau directed the episode, which originally aired in the United States on ABC on November 3, 2009. The episode sees spaceships appear over 29 of the world's major cities. Though the alien \\"Visitors\\" claim to come in peace, it transpires that they have been infiltrating the planet for decades, and are planning on enslaving the human species. Parallels have been drawn between the Visitors and US Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, though Peters and co-producer Jeffrey Bell refute that they were intentional. Bell feels that while the original series was more of a military show with a clear enemy, the reimagining focuses more on the paranoia of not knowing who can be trusted. The episode incorporates aspects of the original series, including the Visitors' giant spaceships, but is quick to reveal the Visitors' true motivations, as Peters felt awareness of the original story was already high. The episode was watched by 14.3 million US viewers, and received generally positive reviews. USA Today Robert Bianco praised it for \\"quickly establishing its own identity\\" independent of the original series, while E! Online named it the best pilot episode in \\"forever\\". In contrast, The New York Times Mike Hale called the episode \\"slapdash and formulaic\\", while David Hinckley of the Daily News deemed it \\"an elaborately costumed popcorn flick\\". Plot When spaceships appear over 29 of the world's major cities, the alien \\"Visitors\\" claim to come in peace. Their leader Anna (Morena Baccarin) offers to trade technology and cures for many diseases with mankind, in return for water and minerals. She invites TV journalist Chad Decker (Scott Wolf) to interview her, on the condition he only portray the Visitors in a positive light. Federal Bureau of Investigation counterterrorism agent Erica Evans (Elizabeth Mitchell) disapproves that her teenage son Tyler (Logan Huffman) is so enamoured by the aliens, being recruited for the V Peace Ambassador Program by the beautiful Visitor Lisa (Laura Vandervoort). Erica and her partner Dale Maddox (Alan Tudyk) investigate a group of terrorists whose activity spiked during the Visitors' initial appearance. They discover an abandoned hideout containing explosives, fake IDs and a deceased man who was tortured prior to his death. His cellphone contains details of a sleeper cell meeting, which Erica attends. Elsewhere, Catholic priest Jack Landry (Joel Gretsch) is suspicious of the Visitors, and warns his parishioners to be wary of them. He doubts his stance when a previously wheelchair-bound parishioner is able to walk again, but has his suspicions confirmed when a mortally wounded man arrives at the church, telling Jack he knows the real reason behind the Visitors' appearance on Earth, handing him a dossier on the aliens and details of a secret meeting. Businessman Ryan Nichols (Morris Chestnut) is contacted repeatedly throughout the day by his old acquaintance Georgie (David Richmond- Peck), but refuses to go along with what Georgie wants from him, as he is planning on asking his girlfriend Valerie (Lourdes Benedicto) to marry him. It transpires that Georgie is running the meeting which both Erica and Jack attend. He demands that all new attendants have an incision made in their skin to prove they are human, as the Visitors are actually reptiles with cloned human flesh hiding their reptilian appearance. He claims that the Visitors have been infiltrating Earth for years, and have installed agents in high positions of society with the ultimate intention of enslaving the human species. Jack shows Georgie the dossier, which contains photographs of the visitors in disguise, one of whom Erica recognizes from the fake passports seized during the earlier raid. The group are suddenly attacked by a group of human-disguised Visitors, including Erica's partner Dale. She is able to overpower him, while Ryan arrives and defends Georgie. They escape from the building, and Ryan reveals that he is actually a Visitor, but opposes their plans. He returns home with the intention of breaking up with his girlfriend to protect her, but in his absence she has discovered the engagement ring he purchased for her. Erica and Jack discuss beginning a resistance movement against the Visitors. Production It was announced in May 2009 that a reimagining of the 1983 miniseries V created by Kenneth Johnson, had been picked up by ABC. Cast member Mitchell noted that the show would do service to the most iconic moments from the original franchise. Executive producer Scott Peters later confirmed that the new series would incorporate memorable elements of the original, including \\"the huge ships [and] the red uniforms\\" seen in the pilot, as: \\"we are well aware of those moments and looking to put our own little spin on them to tip our hat to the old audience.\\" Asked about the 1983 reveal of the Visitors' reptilian appearance beneath their human disguise, Peters noted of the reimagining: \\"We tried to put our own [spin on it]. We're ... a little bit different than their execution of it. It wasn't so much latex mask as it is real flesh and blood.\\" The Visitors' spaceship was entirely computer generated, and all scenes which took place aboard it were filmed in front of a green screen. The internal design of the Visitor ship appears to be based on Santiago Calatrava's futurist style of architecture as the hallways appear to be based on the Milwaukee Art Museum hallways and the white L'Hemisf√®ric building from the City of the Arts and the Sciences in Valencia can be seen in the middle of the Visitor city, both of which were designed by Calatrava. Calatrava's designs have made their way into numerous science-fiction productions such as the Star Trek: The Next Generation movies and the Alliance worlds in the movie Serenity. Peters, who wrote the pilot episode with his mentor Sam Egan, felt that it was important to reveal the Visitors' secret quickly, as: \\"There is this huge awareness of the original. The story is already known and out there, so we want to leap forward quickly, so we don't build and build and build to something people already know.\\" Co- producer Jeffrey Bell, commenting on differences between the original and reimagining, stated: While similarities between the Visitors and the Obama and Bush administrations have been discussed in the media, Peters refuted that they were intentional. He has stated that the theme of the show is \\"blind devotion\\", with no political or religious agenda. Peters commented: \\"Watching any television show is a subjective experience. If you're looking for something in a show, you can find it, whether you're on one side of the political spectrum or the other. The central theme of this show is blind devotion, and you can look at that in two different ways. It's our job, as storytellers, to put some provocative things out there and leave some things open to interpretation.\\" Bell added: \\"We're talking about metaphors and allegories here. On a certain level, I just want to remind people it's a show about spaceships.\\" Casting Elizabeth Mitchell plays Erica Evans, a \\"traditional hero\\" The cast of V features a number of actors from other science-fiction series, including Lost, Firefly and Smallville. Peters has stated that the casting of so many actors from a science-fiction background was coincidental, explaining: \\"Obviously, we went for the best actors we could possibly find. It's a nice bonus that a lot of these folks have appeared in genre shows in the past, but it was not designed that way. We also wanted to make sure that as we moved forward, we honoured and respected the characters and the themes that the (original) show envisioned, while introducing brand new characters and brand new themes that make sense in a post-9/11 world.\\" Mitchell was a fan of the original series as a child, recalling: \\"I liked the escape of it; I liked the entertainment of it. It was a fun night for me. I was allowed to watch an hour of television with my parents, and we made a kind of celebration of it. I hope that other teenagers will do that with their parents with this show.\\" Mitchell's role in V sees her play an FBI agent with traits traditionally assigned to males. She commented: \\"I like playing a traditional hero. I don't think I've ever done it before. Sigourney Weaver said she always chooses male roles because they are meatier.\\" Mitchell characterizes Erica as having \\"a little bit of a hero complex\\", but \\"her joy and her love and her true affection is with her son, and the fact that he is in imminent danger (makes it) fun to play.\\" Fifty to sixty actresses auditioned for the role of Anna. Baccarin was initially rejected following her audition, as Peters did not believe she had the right look for the role. He reconsidered, however, and believes that Baccarin brings a seriousness and \\"commanding presence\\" to the part. Baccarin has said of her role: \\"being, I guess, the face of what people want to see... I think there's an aspect of politicians: You need to embody what everybody wants to see, and at the same time you have your own agenda.\\" Laura Vandervoort plays the Visitor Lisa. Vandervoort is unaware of Lisa's ultimate agenda, which she believes makes the creative process more exciting. She explained: \\"My direction is to play her as honestly as possible, so I'm playing her as a human with a secret. I'm playing a young 17-year-old who is possibly in love.\\" Scott Wolf spoke of his role as journalist Chad Decker: \\"Part of the fun will be that relationship between his ambition and his journalistic integrity.\\" David Richmond-Peck who plays Georgie has deemed his character: \\"A really dark, multi-layered complex character with a past. It's an extremely demanding role because of the weight this character carries. Even just doing a scene in an office, at the end of the day your neck is cramped up ‚Äî to maintain that intensity in the performance is an extreme amount of mental and physical work even while standing still. You‚Äôve got to have that on you at all times.\\" Joel Gretsch was cast as Catholic priest Jack Landry. The character was originally scripted as being much younger, in his late twenties to early thirties. When the production team cast Mitchell as Erica, they began to consider making Jack \\"a little bit more man's man\\", and cast Gretsch in the role when he coincidentally contacted Peters immediately after this alteration had been made. Peters characterized Jack's motivation in the pilot episode as attempting to reconcile the reality of arriving spaceships with his religious beliefs, finding his faith shaken. Promotion ABC executives intended to promote the episode's broadcast by hiring skywriters to create giant 'V's above twenty-six US landmarks from October 23, 2009, until the premiere on November 3, 2009. The campaign would have targeted 15 cities across the US. Lisa de Moraes for The Washington Post criticized the idea, noting that ABC's parent company Disney had previously announced its intention to cut carbon emissions from fuels by half by 2012 as part of its commitment to environmental affairs. Aviation authorities estimated that ABC's marketing stunt would use around 400 gallons of fuel, containing 800 grams of lead, releasing three tons of CO2 and other pollutants into the atmosphere. Following de Moraes' complaint, the skywriting plans were subsequently cancelled, with an ABC representative commenting that the network had decided to spend its money on alternate initiatives. Reception The episode was watched by 14.3 million US viewers, and attained a 5.2/14 in the 18-49 demographic. It was watched by 2.16 million Canadian viewers, making it the first debut of the 2009 Canadian TV season to attain over 2 million viewers. The episode received generally favorable reviews, with E! Online rating it 11/10 and calling it \\"the best pilot we've seen in, well, forever.\\" USA Today Robert Bianco put V on his list of the top ten new shows of the TV season, stating that the remake is well-made and \\"quickly establishes its own identity.\\" Comparing it to the original series, Bianco noted that the remake could easily have been a failure, yet managed to \\"contemporize the story without drowning it in paranoia.\\" Maureen Ryan for the Chicago Tribune noted that the \\"character drama\\" in the pilot episode was \\"clunky\\" but overall found the episode \\"solidly entertaining and suitably suspenseful.\\" Ken Tucker for Entertainment Weekly graded the episode 'B+' calling it \\"excellently acted\\" and noting that Mitchell is \\"fast becoming TV's go-to gal for strong, brainy women of action\\". Varietys Brian Lowry opined that the episode \\"busily races through too much business, but it dangles a tantalizing array of plots, and features a knockout performance (in more ways than one) by Morena Baccarin as the cool, beguiling alien leader.\\" He called Baccarin the \\"real breakout\\" star of the episode, deeming Anna \\"TV's coolest alien since the invention of the Vulcan nerve pinch.\\" Varietys Brian Lowry praised Morena Baccarin as Anna, the Visitors' leader Mary McNamara for the Los Angeles Times commented on parallels drawn between the Visitors and President Barack Obama, insofar as: \\"The instant adoration, the attractiveness and rhetorical skills of Anna, the idea that the Visitors will woo us with universal healthcare and then destroy us all seem a right-wingish take on the president's ascendancy.\\" She continued: \\"Perhaps that is the creators' intent, but most successful science fiction contains an element of, if not outright humor, then the absurd. That the human race will be enslaved not through brainwashing or firepower but adequate healthcare is pretty hilarious in a dark and almost possible way. And Anna and her crew seem to embody more of a Wall Street deregulated/Bernie Madoff mentality‚Äîbig returns for minimum investment. And we all know how that turns out.\\" Linda Stasi for The New York Post conversely compared the Visitors to extremist Muslims. Though in the original series the aliens were a metaphor for Nazis, Stasi commented: \\"TV shows no longer have to rely on Nazis, because now we have the hated extremist Muslims to make all bad-guy metaphors with\\", adding on the Visitors' appearance: \\"Once you peel back the outer, good- looking shell, you've got your standard outer-space Nazi/Taliban lizard person lurking beneath.\\" Matt Roush for TV Guide compared the V pilot to science- fiction shows Lost and FlashForward, noting that V is \\"undeniably more simplistic [...] in its us-vs.-them setup\\", but commenting that he was \\"instantly seduced and hooked by its lavish production values, the immediately gripping storyline and a strong cast\\", concluding: V may not initially dig as deep as FlashForward, but there's a juicy urgency to all of the interpersonal and intergalactic melodrama, with plenty of action and surprising reveals.\\" King Features' entertainment reporter Cindy Elavsky called V: \\"the best new show on television, by far. The special effects are feature-film quality; the writing is intelligent and time-relevant; and the acting is first-rate. The first five minutes alone will hook you for the entire season.\\" In contrast, Mike Hale for The New York Times commented: \\"The ideas in V, about alien encounters and mass delusion and media manipulation, are enticing. It's too bad that they're floating around in a show that at this early stage, is so slapdash and formulaic in its storytelling.\\" Heather Havrilesky of Salon.com commented that plot points such as the Visitors attempting to create worldwide instability by printing fake IDs were unbelievable, and that talk of launching a resistance movement was \\"tiresome and pointless\\". She posed the question: \\"Isn't there a new way to handle the alien invasion story? Isn't there something a little more subtle and hauntingly evil out there than sneaky reptiles with really good publicists?\\" David Hinckley for the Daily News called the episode \\"an elaborately costumed popcorn flick\\", opining that whilst the original series \\"probed the subtleties of human psychology in the face of ominous uncertainty that threatened to become mortal danger\\", the reimagining is \\"about as subtle as a Donald Trump boardroom firing.\\"  References   External links  * * V Category:2009 American television episodes Category:V (2009 TV series) episodes Category:Television episodes set in Los Angeles ","title":"Pilot (V)"},{"id":"24962640","text":"Vardon is a combination French and Scottish surname that still prevails in both countries and has been carried into the new world. The family name Vardon is most famously held by the professional golfer, Harry Vardon (1870‚Äì1937), who invented what is commonly known as the Vardon Grip, and had the Vardon Trophy named after him. Vardons of Montreal Vardon is a relatively well known name in Canada, especially in Montreal, where the family name had been for some time associated with an old Scottish clan that had resided in the city since the 18th century. The Baron Vardon family was the offspring of the Scottish industrialist and explorer Ismael Vardon, who set up in the city after being forced out of England for involvement with anti-monarchy groups and pro-Catholic organizations that were at the time regarded as militant terrorists. Ismael prospered in the new world, establishing himself in textiles and banking, while continuing to undermine the British at every opportunity. He was known to harbour and work closely with French Canadians, it is thought because of their shared Catholic sensibilities. He had 12 children and over 70 grandchildren at the time of his death in 1816. It is believed that Ismael Vardon is buried now in the town of Vardon in Israel. Ismael's sons continued the business, some remaining faithful to his fundamentalist Catholic outlook, and others married Protestants of Montreal's uppercrust social circles. The family was divided by the time the American Civil War was underway. There were a number of male grandchildren that went to war there on a volunteer basis, and there were some that did not return. The fervent Catholic strain of the Vardon clan all but dissolved as the family moved into the 20th century, however, there were some members of the family that held on to Ismael's militant notions and beliefs and it is believed that certain descendants continue to hold these views until this day. Other Vardons were widely known for their involvement in organized crime. Joseph Vardon, a descendant of Ismael, had a lengthy criminal record that began in France, while he was serving with the Canadian military there in World War II . Though Joseph was not considered a radical in the religious sense, he was known for his ingenuity at eluding police. He was involved or indirectly involved in the planning and execution of some of the most daring heists in the Montreal area from 1949 to 1978. It is known that Joseph fathered three children in his marriage and at least another two out of wedlock. One of his son's served in the US Marines with distinction in the Vietnam War and fathered two known children. Joseph Vardon died in 1980 in Montreal.

However, the team folded after Fausch was given the only lease to Evansville's only football stadium, Bosse Field. Spiegel then joined the Crimson Giants. A few scheduling errors prevented the team from playing many of their games during the latter half of the 1921 season and as a result, the Crimson Giants' players were unpaid. Spiegel, and quarterback Menz Lindsey, then formed what was known as the \\"Committee of Five\\". The Committee then forced control of the team from Fausch. However, Fausch was still the holder of the franchise rights of the Crimson Giants and therefore the owner of the team.

The caves include the Bournillon cave, which has the highest cave entrance in Europe. Location The caves are located in the limestone area in the Rh√¥ne-Alpes region, in the lower Alps. History The caves are well known to British explorers, since the expedition led by Ken Pierce in the early 1960s introduced them to the area. Description Entrance of Bournillon, the highest cave entrance in Europe. The total area with the caves extends to around 400 square miles (1000 square kilometres) with a depth of up to 1271 metres (4170 feet). The surrounding area around the caves is the largest karst area in Europe. The caves are formed because of the Cretaceous limestone throughout the caves, that is up to 400 metres (1300 feet) thick at some points. The caves passages are a mix of large, old and dry tunnels, full of calcite deposits with narrow streamways and waterfalls. There are specific sets of caves because of the geology of the area, each with their own characteristics. In the north east (from the Moucherolle up to the Sornin Plateaux) the caves are regarded as very deep and very demanding in the grading system, especially considering the variable weather in the area. In the north west of the system, the caves (including the Autrans and Meaudre systems) are of current interest, as many new caving discoveries are being made, particularly in the Meaudre area, on a regular basis. Further south the caves vary in their characteristics, with systems in the Herbouilly Plateau being of different gradings. The area surrounding the Vernaison and its associated river valley contains many caves and systems, with one of the most explored being the Grotte de la Luire just south of Saint-Agnan-en-Vercors which is located at the Bournillon entrance, which is the largest cave entrance in Europe. Probably the most famous and deepest cave in the region is the Gouffre Berger cave. This cave includes the narrow shafts, descending into the Grand Galerie, which itself is home to very large and very old stalagmites. This particular system follows the slope of the limestone beds for , until it meets the flooded area of the Cuves de Sassenage..  Skeleton of Boy  On 23 May 1985, the skeleton of a young boy was found in the caves. Originally, he was believed to be the body of Ludovic Janvier, a boy who disappeared from Grenoble on 17 March 1983. Despite pleas from his family, especially his mother, his DNA has never been tested and he has yet to be identified. Ludovic has also never been found.

Surrey cricketer McMahon was an orthodox left-arm spin bowler with much variation in speed and flight who was spotted by Surrey playing in club cricket in North London and brought on to the county's staff for the 1947 season at the age of 29.At the time, it was believed he was 27: his birth date in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack and Playfair Cricket Annual is consistently shown as 1919 until the end of his career: e.g. In the first innings of his first match, against Lancashire at The Oval, he took five wickets for 81 runs. In his first full season, 1948, he was Surrey's leading wicket-taker and in the last home game of the season he was awarded his county cap - he celebrated by taking eight Northamptonshire wickets for 46 runs at The Oval, six of them coming in the space of 6.3 overs for seven runs. This would remain the best bowling performance of his first-class career, not surpassed, but he did equal it seven years later. In the following game, the last away match of the season, he took 10 Hampshire wickets for 150 runs in the match at Bournemouth. In the 1948 season as a whole, he took 91 wickets at an average of 28.07. As a tail-end left-handed batsman, he managed just 93 runs in the season at an average of 4.22. The emergence of Tony Lock as a slow left-arm bowler in 1949 brought a stuttering end of McMahon's Surrey career. Though he played in 12 first-class matches in the 1949 season, McMahon took only 19 wickets; a similar number of matches in 1950 brought 34 wickets. In 1951, he played just seven times and in 1952 only three times. In 1953, Lock split the first finger of his left hand, and played in only 11 of Surrey's County Championship matches; McMahon played as his deputy in 14 Championship matches, though a measure of their comparative merits was that Lock's 11 games produced 67 wickets at 12.38 runs apiece, while McMahon's 14 games brought him 45 wickets at the, for him, low average of 21.53. At the end of the 1953 season, McMahon was allowed to leave Surrey to join Somerset, then languishing at the foot of the County Championship and recruiting widely from other counties and other countries. Somerset cricketer Somerset's slow bowling in 1954 was in the hands of leg-spinner Johnny Lawrence, with support from the off-spin of Jim Hilton while promising off-spinner Brian Langford was on National Service. McMahon filled a vacancy for a left-arm orthodox spinner that had been there since the retirement of Horace Hazell at the end of the 1952 season; Hazell's apparent successor, Roy Smith, had failed to realise his promise as a bowler in 1953, though his batting had advanced significantly. McMahon instantly became a first-team regular and played in almost every match during his four years with the county, not missing a single Championship game until he was controversially dropped from the side in August 1957, after which he did not play in the Championship again. In the 1954 season, McMahon, alongside fellow newcomer Hilton, was something of a disappointment, according to Wisden: \\"The new spin bowlers, McMahon and Hilton, did not attain to the best standards of their craft in a wet summer, yet, like the rest of the attack, they would have fared better with reasonable support in the field and from their own batsmen,\\" it said. McMahon took 85 wickets at an average of 27.47 (Hilton took only 42 at a higher average). His best match was against Essex at Weston-super-Mare where he took six for 96 in the first innings and five for 45 in the second to finish with match figures of 11 for 141, which were the best of his career. He was awarded his county cap in the 1954 season, but Somerset remained at the bottom of the table. The figures for the 1955 were similar: McMahon this time took 75 wickets at 28.77 apiece. There was a small improvement in his batting and the arrival of Bryan Lobb elevated McMahon to No 10 in the batting order for most of the season, and he responded with 262 runs and an average of 9.03. This included his highest-ever score, 24, made in the match against Sussex at Frome. A week later in Somerset's next match, he equalled his best-ever bowling performance, taking eight Kent wickets for 46 runs in the first innings of a match at Yeovil through what Wisden called \\"clever variation of flight and spin\\". These matches brought two victories for Somerset, but there were only two others in the 1955 season and the side finished at the bottom of the Championship for the fourth season running. At the end of the 1955 season, Lawrence retired and McMahon became Somerset's senior spin bowler for the 1956 season, with Langford returning from National Service as the main support. McMahon responded with his most successful season so far, taking 103 wickets at an average of 25.57, the only season in his career in which he exceeded 100 wickets. The bowling average improved still further in 1957 to 23.10 when McMahon took 86 wickets. But his season came to an abrupt end in mid-August 1957 when, after 108 consecutive Championship matches, he was dropped from the first team during the Weston- super-Mare festival. Though he played some games for the second eleven later in August, he regained his place in the first team for only a single end-of- season friendly match, and he was told that his services were not required for the future, a decision, said Wisden, that \\"proved highly controversial\\". Sacked by Somerset The reason behind McMahon's sacking did not become public knowledge for many years. In its obituary of him in 2002, McMahon was described by Wisden as \\"a man who embraced the antipodean virtues of candour and conviviality\\". It went on: \\"Legend tells of a night at the Flying Horse Inn in Nottingham when he beheaded the gladioli with an ornamental sword, crying: 'When Mac drinks, everybody drinks!'\\" The obituary recounts a further escapade in second eleven match at Midsomer Norton where a curfew imposed on the team was circumvented by \\"a POW-type loop\\" organised by McMahon, \\"with his team-mates escaping through a ground-storey window and then presenting themselves again\\". As the only Somerset second eleven match that McMahon played in at Midsomer Norton was right at the end of the 1957 season, this may have been the final straw. But in any case there had been \\"an embarrassing episode at Swansea's Grand Hotel\\" earlier in the season, also involving Jim Hilton, who was also dismissed at the end of the season. Team-mates and club members petitioned for McMahon to be reinstated, but the county club was not to be moved. After a period in Lancashire League cricket with Milnrow Cricket Club, McMahon moved back to London where he did office work, later contributing some articles to cricket magazines.

The film is based upon a 1918 play of the same name by , which was later adapted by David Belasco and performed on Broadway to great success in 1921 by his muse Lenore Ulric.Screenplay Info for Kiki (1926) TCM.comKiki at silentera.com database The film was restored from the only three \\"rather incomplete\\" surviving copies, one each in English, French and Czech. As noted in the prologue to the restored film, the English and French story lines differ. Plot Kiki (Norma Talmadge) ekes out a living selling newspapers on the streets of Paris. When she learns that a chorus girl has been fired from the Folies Barbes revue managed by Victor Renal (Ronald Colman), she sets out to fulfill her dream and apply for the job. Poverty stricken, she spends her rent money to buy suitable clothes. She gets kicked out the first time, as she was not sent by the Agency, but manages to sneak back in. While waiting in the reception area, she is mistaken for the secretary by an Agency applicant, who gives Kiki her letter of recommendation to present to Renal. He mistakes it for Kiki's, and gives her an audition. Her singing talent gets her the job. Her debut, however, is a disaster. She repeatedly gets in the way of the show's star and Renal's fianc√©e, Paulette Mascar (Gertrude Astor). Paulette finally pushes her, sending her crashing into a harp in the orchestra pit. When Renal tries to separate the battling women, Paulette slaps him. Renal also sends Kiki a letter of dismissal. When she comes to see him, he feels sorry for her and gives her back her job. He tries to hustle her out of his office, before Paulette enters, but Kiki refuses to leave. As a result, Paulette and Renal have a falling-out. Renal decides to take Kiki to dinner. Paulette goes out with Renal's financial backer, Baron Rapp (Marc McDermott), and ends up at the same restaurant. Determined to humiliate her rival, Paulette invites herself to Renal's table and taunts Kiki into drinking several glasses of champagne. Kiki becomes drunk, embarrassing Renal. He deposits her in his limousine and asks where she lives. As she has been evicted for not paying the rent, she confesses she has no place to go, so he takes her home. He kisses her, but when he tries for more, she locks herself in his bedroom. He is forced to sleep (uncomfortably) in another room. Each day, Renal decides to get rid of her, but each night he relents. Meanwhile, Kiki intercepts Paulette's daily letters to him to prevent a reconciliation. Renal finally learns about the letters from Rapp. Rapp recommends he get back together with Paulette and offers to take Kiki off his hands. Kiki mistakenly believes that Renal wants Paulette back, while Renal thinks in error that Kiki welcomes Rapp's attentions and greater wealth. Kiki decides to go, taking only what she came with, but then changes her mind and decides to fight for her love. After she threatens Paulette with a knife, Renal orders her to leave. Thinking quickly, Kiki pretends to fall into a coma, convincing a doctor that she is a victim of catalepsy, which the doctor states might last up to two years. Upon hearing this, Rapp makes a hasty departure. Despite Paulette's urging to leave for a performance, Renal decides he cannot leave Kiki alone. Once Paulette is gone, Kiki kisses Renal and confesses she loves him. He embraces her.

It was built by the Royal Thai Government with support from international relief agencies including the United Nations. It opened in October 1979 and closed in early-July 1980. At its peak the population exceeded 30,000 refugees; no formal census was ever conducted.  Origins of the Cambodian refugee crisis  Vietnam invaded Democratic Kampuchea in December 1978 and by early-1979 thousands of Cambodians had crossed the Thai-Cambodian border seeking safety and food. By May 1979 large numbers of refugees had set up improvised camps at Kampot, Mairut, Lumpuk, Khao Larn, and Ban Thai Samart, near Aranyaprathet.Thai / Cambodian Border Refugee Camps Then on 10 October, 60,000 Khmer Rouge soldiers and civilians under their control arrived at Khlong Wa and, shortly thereafter, Khlong Gai Thuen.  Establishment of Sa Kaeo Refugee Camp  On 22 October 1979 Colonel Sanan Kajornklam of the Thai Supreme Command telephoned Martin Barber of UNHCR to inform him that the Thai military would transport Cambodians at the border from areas south of Aranyaprathet to a location outside of the Thai town of Sa Kaeo, about 40 miles inside the border. UNHCR was invited to establish a holding center there that would house up to 90,000 refugees.Robinson, W. C., Terms of Refuge: The Indochinese Exodus and the International Response. Zed Books, New York, 1998, p. 69. UNHCR sent one of its newest recruits, British journalist Mark Malloch Brown, together with his Thai assistant, Kadisis Rochanakorn, to survey the site, a 160,000-square-meter uninhabited area used for rice cultivation. The Thai government requested that UNHCR make immediate emergency preparations for the Cambodians. Brown hired a bulldozer and started carving roads in the mud. A backhoe was hired to dig latrines. Water tanks were donated by Christian and Missionary Alliance (CAMA), which also donated 100,000 pieces of bamboo and thatch to construct a hospital, built hastily by 200 Thai workers Brown hired at US$2 a day. A crude warehouse was built. Catholic Relief Services donated plastic rope, straw mats, and baby bottles. With less than one day's advance notice, UNHCR and other volunteer agencies hastily constructed basic camp infrastructure as thousands of malnourished Cambodians arrived. Several hundred unaccompanied children were in these first groups of refugees.Mason L, Brown R. Rice, Rivalry, and Politics: Managing Cambodian Relief. Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press, 1983. On 24 October 8,000 refugees arrived by bus from settlements at the border. According to Dr. Hans Nothdurft: \\"Initially, the camp was no more than a fenced-off area of bushland with no housing facilities, no water, and no sewage system; approximately 2.7 square meters of space were available for each person. Part of the area was designated for the camp hospital; a bulldozer-cleared field with some bamboo- canvas construction provided primitive shelter for approximately 300 patients. When the first refugees arrived, there were only three doctors and eight other health workers present. The health status of the first refugees in Sa Kaeo was dire; for several months many of them had been starving in the mountains sandwiched between the Vietnamese to the east and the closed Thai border to the west.\\"Deathwatch Cambodia\\" Time Magazine cover story, November 12, 1979 Nearly 2,000 severely ill or dying refugees were brought to the hospital area in the first few days. The medical personnel were assisted by volunteers from Bangkok organized by the wife of the US ambassador. As the refugees arrived, nurses sent those who appeared to be sick or starving to a makeshift hospital which Dr. Levi Roque constructed by stringing a wire from a bulldozer to a tent pole and draping it with canvas.Thompson, Larry Clinton. Refugee Workers in the Indochina Exodus, 1975-1982. Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2010, p. 188. There were no beds; refugees lay on straw mats. Khmer Rouge soldiers were mixed in with the women and children. A reporter said, \\"They did not look like human beings...but rather like wild animals...They slept huddled side by side like beasts in a cage.\\" Doctors wrote instructions for care on the chests of patients with marking pens of different colors for different treatments. The US embassy volunteers were pressed into giving injections and other duties normally performed only by trained medical personnel. Reporters were persuaded to carry buckets of electrolyte fluid from patient to patient and try to get them to drink cupfuls of the liquid. In the midst of the chaos, monsoons struck and many refugees died on the cold, wet ground without being able to get to the hospital. During the camp's first 14 days of operation between 14 and 42 people died each day, according to Dr. Keith Dahlberg.Dahlberg, Keith: \\"Cambodian Refugee Camp 1979,\\" an excerpt from Flame Tree: a Novel of Modern Burma, Thailand: Orchid Press, 2004. Within eight days the camp's population grew to over 30,000 people. After 8 November mortality dropped to a daily average of three or four,Susan E. Holck and Willard Cates, \\"Fertility and Population Dynamics in Two Kampuchean Refugee Camps,\\" Studies in Family Planning, Vol. 13, No. 4, Apr., 1982, pp. 118-124. over half of whom died outside the hospital. There was no naturally occurring source of potable water. The Thai military trucked water in from Aranyaprathet. Drainage in the campsite was such that shortly after the refugees arrived, it flooded and a few refugees, too weak to lift their heads, drowned as they lay under tents made of plastic sheets.Levy BS, Susott DC. Years of Horror, Days of Hope: Responding to the Cambodian Refugee Crisis. Millwood, NY: Associated Faculty Press, 1987. Camp services By the end of November 1979 some 15 Thai and international relief agencies were providing services at Sa Kaeo, including the Thai Red Cross, ICRC, MSF, Christian and Missionary Alliance, World Vision, and the Israeli Defense Force. Catholic and Buddhist institutions provided additional volunteers as did several embassies. Numerous individuals also volunteered their services. The medical personnel at Sa Kaeo (up to 60 doctors and 170 other health workers by early-1980) represented different nationalities with different languages, cultural values, and medical training, but only a few team members had ever worked in a developing country or had seen malaria and severe malnutrition before‚Äîthe two prevailing problems in the camp. Their repeated calls for x-ray facilities, for more laboratory support, and their preference for expensive drug regimens reflected medical cultural values of developed countries. Water was initially carried by truck to the camp and stored in aluminum drums. Three deep wells drilled during the second week of operation were eventually connected via a network of pipes to distribute water throughout the camp. A trench latrine was dug around the periphery of the camp. Thai provincial health authorities provided insect control by draining stagnant water and spraying insecticides. A 1,200-bed hospital was initially no more than a thatched roof without walls, where patients lay on mats on the dirt floor with medical records and intravenous solutions clipped to wires above them. Within a week, however, the teams had improvised a blood bank, delivery room, receiving ward, and a special nutrition center.Dahlberg, K. \\"Medical Care of Cambodian Refugees,\\" JAMA March 14, 1980 243:10, pp. 1062-65. Physical condition of the refugees Mass starvation dominated the medical picture. Marasmus, kwashiorkor, beriberi, and anemia were widespread, with many patients showing all four. Vitamin deficiencies, particularly of vitamin A and vitamin B1 were common. Hookworm and ascaris infections aggravated malnutrition and anemia, especially in children. Dysentery, both bacillary and amebic, also complicated many patients' nutritional status. Lice and scabies were endemic. Most refugees were infected with malaria, and 55 percent of cases were diagnosed as falciparum, much of it chloroquine‚Äìresistant. Numerous cases of cerebral malaria and blackwater fever were encountered, and a few cases of hemorrhagic fever due to dengue.  Composition of the camp population  Rosalynn Carter, at Sa Kaeo, holds a child in her arms while speaking with the mother, 9 November 1979. A large proportion of the Cambodians in Sa Kaeo were Khmer Rouge soldiers and the civilians they had forced to flee with them to the border. This was because the Khmer Rouge were eager to move some of their cadre to the sanctuary inside Thailand where they could receive food and medical attention, rest and recuperate, and regain their strength in order to fight the Vietnamese.Terry, F., Condemned to Repeat?: The Paradox of Humanitarian Action, Cornell University Press 2002, p. 118. It was also Thai policy to maintain separate camps for populations under Khmer Rouge control, since providing aid to them was politically controversial and because the Thai government considered the Khmer Rouge the only force capable of mounting any meaningful resistance to the Vietnamese. The Khmer Rouge quickly replicated their power structures in Sa Kaeo and their cadre exerted almost complete control over camp residents.  Visit by First Lady Rosalynn Carter  In an effort to show US support for the Thai response, First Lady Rosalynn Carter visited Thailand with Richard Holbrooke, several members of congress and a group of journalists to tour the camp on 9 November 1979.Kamm H. Cambodia: Report from a Stricken Land. 1st ed. New York: Arcade Pub., 1998.Rosalynn Carter, \\"When Statistics Become Human Beings,\\" In Levy and Susott, pp. 53-62. Her visit was widely publicized and appeared on the nightly news on all major US networks. In one frequently-aired clip, a refugee died in front of Carter while an American physician protested irritably: \\"'This girl is about to go,' said an angry doctor, ordering the newsmen covering the visit to keep back. 'She just had a blood transfusion, but she's not going to make it.'\\"\\"A Devastating Trip,\\" Time Magazine, Nov. 19, 1979. Later the First Lady recalled: \\"I picked up a baby and put it down on a blanket on the ground. They started crying, and when I turned around the baby had died.\\"Walker, Diana H., Public & Private: Twenty Years Photographing the Presidency. Washington, D.C.: National Geographic Insight, 2002, p. 46. The First Lady later told reporters, \\"I'm emotionally overwhelmed. It's a very difficult situation for me as a wife and a mother to visit the camp and see such poverty and misery. I'm going home as fast as I can to tell my husband about it.\\"Butler, Victoria \\"Visitors on refugee bandwagon,\\" The Globe and Mail, November 13, 1979.  Camp closing  Embarrassed by the unfavorable impression created by Sa Kaeo, the Thai government asked Mark Malloch Brown of the UNHCR to prepare a new site with better drainage and more space.Daniel Susott, \\"Khao-I-Dang: The Early Days.\\" In Levy and Susott, p. 78. In late-November 1979 Khao-I-Dang Holding Center was opened. The Thai Government immediately began transferring refugees from Sa Kaeo to Khao-I-Dang. Since most of the refugees were under the control of the Khmer Rouge, the Thai government encouraged them to return to areas of northwestern Cambodia under Khmer Rouge control. This was viewed as a gross violation of human rights by many aid workers, including the Preah Maha Ghosananda and the Reverend Peter L. Pond, who staged a protest at the camp's Buddhist temple in June 1980 and were imprisoned by the Thai military.Chan, Sucheng and Kim, Audrey, Not just victims: Conversations with Cambodian Community Leaders in the United States. Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2003; p. 35. Another camp, Sa Kaeo II, was opened and by July 1980 all refugees had been transferred to other camps or forcibly repatriated,  Impact of Sa Kaeo  Images of dead and dying refugees at Sa Kaeo were broadcast around the world and international aid began to flow into Thailand to assist the refugees. This also engendered the belief that famine was general in Cambodia. A front-page article in The New York Times said, \\"2.25 Million Cambodians Are Said to Face Starvation.\\"Seymour Hersh, \\"2.25 Million Cambodians Are Said to Face Starvation; Plight Held Worse Than Refugees'\\" The New York Times, August 08, 1979, Page A1. The international community responded with large amounts of food aid that was delivered to Cambodians by the \\"land bridge\\" at Nong Chan Refugee Camp.

The first recorded match on the ground was in 1867, when Canterbury cricket team hosted Otago cricket team. Canterbury used the ground infrequently from then through until the 1920s, but hardly stopped during World War I. The first match in the Plunket Shield was played there in December 1907, when Canterbury played Auckland.R.T. Brittenden, Great Days in New Zealand Cricket, A.H. & A.W. Reed, Wellington, 1958, pp. 33‚Äì38. Canterbury returned there in 1979, and played a number of their 1993/94 Shell Cup home matches at the ground. As an international venue The first One Day International at the ground was played between Scotland and Canada during the 2014 Cricket World Cup Qualifier on 23 January 2014. The ground has also hosted three Women's Test matches and six Women's ODIs. In 2013 the controversial Canterbury Cricket proposal to develop Hagley Oval as an international cricket venue was approved by the Environment Court. During the process of building and renovation of the Oval, it suffered two major floodings in 2013. In 2014, Hagley Oval became the eighth Test venue in New Zealand. The Boxing Day match against Sri Lanka marked New Zealand's first Test in Christchurch since the city was hit by a major earthquake in 2011, but nearly 10 years since Lancaster Park held what became the final match in Christchurch in 2006. Brendon McCullum scored his fastest test hundred in New Zealand's history. He also scored his 1000th test run in the 2014 calendar year, but missed out on his 4th test double century in that calendar year. Hagley Oval hosted NZ's opening ceremony and match for the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup, while their final match as host of the World Cup was between England and Scotland on 23 February 2015, which was a day after the 4th anniversary of 2011 Christchurch earthquake. When the Oval has no matches scheduled, it can still be used as a community park, with youth level, mixed- gender cricket being played on Saturdays. The tent-like pavilion was named after the Hadlee Family when the old Hadlee stand of Lancaster Park being demolished first after the Park become unusable. The pitch is oval but widthways not lengthways, with 11 wickets in the block of which 10 are approved for Tests with full boundaries. This makes it the largest cricket ground in New Zealand. There are no drop-in pitches required. It emulates certain aspects of Lord's and a large and fast outfield of Adelaide Oval, so it slopes down evenly outside the boundaries.RESUME PLAY: A NEW ERA FOR CRICKET IN POST-EARTHQUAKE CANTERBURY, TVNZ  History  \\"Cricket in Canterbury had a natural birth. The settlement in 1850 was a planned reproductions of a piece of England in a strange land 12,000 miles away. It was a church-based design, but the bat went with the bible, for if there was to be another England, there most certainly had to be cricket.\\" Application for the Cricket Pitch at Hagley Park, Christchurch, 1855 Hagley Oval's destiny as the historical and spiritual home of cricket in Canterbury was determined in the first days of a new and flourishing Christchurch. Just four months after the arrival of the first four ships, the settlers to Canterbury had formed their very own cricket club. Only months later, as part of Founders' Day celebrations on 16 December 1851, an enthusiastic game ensured the verdant roots of cricket, and those of the city's settlers were well and truly laid. Hagley Oval has since been identified and documented as the cornerstone of Canterbury and New Zealand cricketing activity. During the early decades the Oval hosted a series of inter-provincial matches, as well as the occasional international fixtures. It continues to host all grades of cricket, and was one of the host grounds for the ICC 2015 Cricket World Cup. The Hagley Oval Foundation was established by the Canterbury Cricket Trust and the Canterbury Cricket Association, to raise the funds necessary to fully develop Hagley Oval into an international-standard cricket venue. The ground pays tribute to the cricket history in Canterbury and also provides an exciting opportunity for the future of Canterbury and New Zealand Cricket.Acceptance of Lease of land for Cricket Pitch at Hagley Park, Christchurch ‚Äì 1856 Return to Hagley Oval Cricket and rugby shared Lancaster Park from post World War I until well into the 1990s. By that stage the extended rugby season was encroaching onto cricket's traditional international window in February and March. As early as 1998 Canterbury Cricket recognised the need for a purpose built cricket ground for international and provincial cricket. A return to Hagley Oval was investigated and in 2006/7 the Canterbury Cricket Association determined to prioritise it as its preferred venue. The Canterbury Cricket Trust was established and the Hagley Pavilion designs were developed by early 2011. The Canterbury Cricket Trust The Canterbury Cricket Trust is a registered charitable trust formed specifically for the long-term benefit of cricket in Canterbury. The Trust is an entity closely linked to the Canterbury Cricket Association but operating independently from it. The members of the Board of Trustees are all prominent business people who share a love of cricket and the ability to drive and realise a vision for the future of cricket in Canterbury. The first major project for the Trust was to raise funds through the Hagley Oval Foundation to establish an international- standard quality ground at Hagley Oval. The success of this project has provided a permanent home for Canterbury Cricket and enabled Christchurch to once again play host to prestigious international matches. The Trust administers the Hagley Oval Members Club where Members enjoy unlimited access to domestic and international matches from the comfort of the Members Lounge and Hadlee Pavilion. The next initiative is to raise funding to purchase lights for the Oval to enable day-night games to once again be hosted in Christchurch. 1st Match, Canterbury v England, Hagley Park ‚Äì February 1864 Vision The vision is for a sympathetic development that will enhance the beauty of the current Hagley Oval, complementing the existing facility and elevating it to a high quality, international-standard venue. It will celebrate Canterbury's cricketing past and herald its future. * The ground is set against the stunning natural drop of the well-established trees and fields of Hagley Park. * It is encircled by a low level, rolling embankment. * The heritage Umpires Pavilion is focal point of the ground. * The pavilion is built in a style consistent with the Hagley Oval setting. It includes players' changing rooms and dining, media and members lounge viewing facilities. * A new, international-standard quality cricket block has been developed on the Oval and first-class cricket has already been played on this block. * A newly developed outfield has also been completed and a picket fence encircles the ground. * The ground provides excellent spectator viewing and enhanced spectator enjoyment of the game. * The Pavilion provides an outstanding community facility which will be available for community groups all year round. * The Pavilion is available for other sport codes providing much needed toilet and changing facilities. Resume play A new era for cricket in post- earthquake Christchurch The file Resume Play tells the story of cricket in the Garden City, how it was affected by the quakes, and the controversial development of Hagley Oval into a world-class ground that hosted the opening match of the Cricket World Cup. Produced by Canterbury Cricket with support from the Sport New Zealand, it features interviews from club cricketers, city leaders, \\"backyard cricketer\\" Prime Minister John Key and many of New Zealand's leading players, including Sir Richard Hadlee, Stephen Fleming and Tom Latham. Ground specifications Capacity‚Äì Approx. 20,000 Playing dimensions‚Äì149m x 149m WICKETS‚Äì11 Hadlee Pavilion The Pavilion provides an outstanding community facility which is available for community groups all year round. The Pavilion is available for other sport codes providing much needed toilet and changing facilities. The building was designed by Trevor Watt from leading New Zealand architects, Athfield Architects and built by Southbase Construction in less than ten months under adverse conditions. The building has been the recipient of many national building, design and engineering awards.  Canterbury Cricket Umpires' Association Pavilion  In 1864 this pavilion was erected on the first Canterbury Cricket Club's grounds, called Dilloway's, in order to be ready in time for the visit of an English eleven, captained by George Parr. In the match against Canterbury the English team won convincingly but were impressed by the facilities provided at the grounds at the north-western corner of South Hagley Park (by the junction of Deans and Riccarton Avenues). The well prepared field was neatly fenced and the handsome pavilion, the envy of other local clubs still using tents on match days, provided fine accommodation. Of timber construction the pavilion was built to a traditional English design and provided changing facilities, a communal area for meetings and teas, an open verandah and a viewing balcony. Two years later the pavilion was moved to its present site on Hagley Oval where it was the home of various clubs, the last in the 1980s being Marist. By this date it had served over 120 years and there was concern as to whether it could be retained It had been altered and upgraded several times and had been declared unsafe by the City Council in 1954. The local umpires' association took over the building in 1988 with the intention of restoring it. Under the guidance of the New Zealand Historic Places Trust the building has been fully upgraded, its original appearance returned and it continues to serve a useful function for cricket in Canterbury. Certainly the oldest cricket pavilion in New Zealand, the building may even be the oldest such structure surviving in Australasia. (Local cricketers are prepared to claim it as the oldest in the Southern Hemisphere until this can be proved incorrect!) In December 2003 the building was registered by Heritage New Zealand as a Category 2 Building. Future The next stage in the Hagley Oval development plan is to raise funds for lighting which would enable day-night games to once again be hosted in Christchurch. A fundraising programme commenced in 2016. Approval to install the lights was given in 2019, and a loan secured from the Christchurch City Council in May 2020. The Club hopes to have the lights ready in time for the 2021 Women's Cricket World Cup, with the venue set to host the Final of the tournament.

In June 1956, he coined the term \\"byte\\" for a unit of digital information. In 1990, he was recognized as a computer pioneer by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. Biography Early life  Werner Buchholz was born on 24 October 1922 in Detmold, Germany. His older brother, Carl Hellmut and he were the sons of the merchant and his wife, . Due to the growing anti-semitism in Detmold in 1936, the family moved to Cologne. Werner was able to go to England in 1938 where he attended school, while Carl Hellmut emigrated to America. Because of the threat of invasion in May 1940, Werner with other refugee students was interned by the British and later sent to Canada. With the help of the Jewish community in Toronto, he was released in 1941 and able to attend the University of Toronto. He completed his training as an electrical engineer in the United States at Caltech. His parents were murdered in 1942 (Julius) and 1944 (Elsa) in a concentration camp in Litzmannstadt (≈Å√≥d≈∫). Career Werner Buchholz was a member of the team at IBM that designed the IBM 701 and the IBM 7030 Stretch, IBM's first transistorized supercomputer. His work involved setting standards in the field of character encoding on computing systems. In 1956, he coined the term byte as a unit of digital information. A byte was an ordered collection of bits, which were the smallest amounts of data that a computer could process (\\"bite\\"). In 1990, Buchholz received the IEEE Computer Pioneer Award, awarded since 1981 to recognize and honor individuals whose effort resulted in the creation and vitality of the computer industry. Personal life He worked 40 years at IBM in Poughkeepsie, New York, where he participated in the development of the computer. His wife Anna died in 2007 and their son John in 1975.

The word kuna means \\"marten\\" in Croatian and the same word is used for the current Croatian kuna currency. This kuna was subdivided into 100 banica. It was preceded and replaced by the Yugoslav dinar. History The Croatian kuna was introduced in the Independent State of Croatia (NDH) on 26 July 1941. The kuna replaced the Yugoslav dinar at par and was fixed to the German Reichsmark (‚Ñõ‚Ñ≥) with dual exchange rates, one fixed at 20 kuna = 1 ‚Ñõ‚Ñ≥, the other a state-stimulated rate of *31 December 1941 - 25.00 Kn = 1 ‚Ñõ‚Ñ≥ *31 December 1942 - 37.50 Kn = 1 ‚Ñõ‚Ñ≥ *31 December 1943 - 40.00 Kn = 1 ‚Ñõ‚Ñ≥ *31 December 1944 - 80.00 Kn = 1 ‚Ñõ‚Ñ≥ *6 May 1945 - 120.00 Kn = 1 ‚Ñõ‚Ñ≥ The kuna was withdrawn from circulation from 30 June to 9 July 1945 and replaced by the 1944 issue of the Yugoslav dinar at a rate of 40 kuna = 1 dinar.

The first volume, Hitler's War, was released in hardcover in 2009 without a series title. The paperback edition was later announced as The War That Came Early: Hitler's War. List The series is six volumes: * Hitler's War * West and East * The Big Switch * Coup d'√âtat * Two Fronts * Last Orders (originally announced as Not with a Bang)  Points of divergence  The series's initial point of divergence occurs on July 20, 1936, when Spanish Nationalist leader Jos√© Sanjurjo listens to his pilot's advice and change the conditions of his flight back to Spain, thus averting the crash that caused his death in our timeline. However, the next two years the course of the Spanish Civil War remains virtually the same as Sanjurjo makes the same military and political decisions that Francisco Franco did in real history; only the name of the Nationalist leader changes. However, in 1939, Sanjurjo makes a significantly different decision by deciding to aid the Axis conquest of Gibraltar. (In real history, Franco carefully maintained cordial relations with the British. That, however, comes after the series's main point of divergence.) The timeline again, far more significantly, diverges from history in September 1938. British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and French Prime Minister √âdouard Daladier meet German F√ºhrer Adolf Hitler at Munich, ready to appease Hitler and to force Czechoslovakia to agree. However, their supine attitude and manifest wish to avoid war at any price arises Hitler's predatory instinct. While his generals want to gain time for further building up Germany's armed forces, Hitler feels that the time to strike is now while his opponents are so obviously unprepared. With the extensive British and French concessions, Hitler has no pretext to launch a war, but news of the assassination of Sudeten German leader Konrad Henlein by a Czech nationalist suddenly gives him a casus belli (in actual history, Henlein lived until 1945). Hitler jubilantly declares that there is no further room for negotiations and that his army will attack Czechoslovakia immediately. Chamberlain and Daladier erroneously believe that Hitler himself had Henlein assassinated and, much against their will, are forced to declare war and fulfill their treaty obligations to Czechoslovakia. As a result, World War II starts in 1938 with a German attack on Czechoslovakia, rather than an invasion of Poland a year later. Consequently, as a result of these events, both sides are far less prepared for war than in real history. This timeline can be considered to have been created by the (fictional) Czech nationalist Jaroslav Stribny, who assassinated Henlein. He is never seen onstage, and the reader is given no access to his thoughts and reasoning. Posterity in this timeline would link his name with that of Gavrilo Princip, whose act of assassination had set off the earlier World War I.  Hitler's War  The War That Came Early: Hitler's War, published in 2009, is the first book in the series. Like many of his other series, Turtledove uses multiple viewpoint characters, mostly young soldiers and junior officers. The novel follows the war between September 1938 and the spring of 1939. Czechoslovak campaign left The German Army concentrates most of its available forces for the invasion of Czechoslovakia, leaving the Siegfried Line greatly underdefended and gambling that the French will not launch any major offensive. Indeed, the French content themselves with a token offensive, conquering some minor German border towns and later evacuating them with no strategic effect and failing to seriously relieve the pressure on their Czechoslovak ally. The Soviet Union sends airplanes to aid Czechoslovakia, but the lack of a common border prevents the Soviets from sending ground troops through the intervening territory of Poland and Romania without risking war with those countries, a step for which Joseph Stalin is not ready yet. The Czechoslovak Army offers tenacious and persistent resistance to the overwhelming German forces, causing Prague and other cities to be heavily damaged and a great toll of civilian casualties to occur. The ≈†koda works and other industrial centers are also totally destroyed, which denies the Germans from using them for its armament program later in the war. Later in the conflict, the Slovak Hlinka Guard stages a pro-Nazi rebellion; many Slovak soldiers, even if not joining this uprising, fight only halfheartedly and tend to desert en masse. In addition, Poland and Hungary invade from the north and south, respectively, intent on asserting their own territorial claims over Czechoslovak territory. After German, Hungarian and Polish forces divide Czechoslovakia into two, Czechoslovak resistance crumbles, with the country's leaders forming a government-in-exile in Paris. Many soldiers (mostly Czechs, with some antifascist Slovaks, and Ruthenians) also escape to France, where they will play a significant role later in the war. Impact on Spanish Civil War The outbreak of the European war comes just in time to breathe new life into Republican Spain, which faced an imminent collapse. France reverses its former \\"Non-Intervention\\" policy, and a flow of munitions across the Pyrenees helps the Republic win the Battle of the Ebro and reunite its territory that was separated into two by the Nationalist rebels some months earlier. The International Brigades, which were about to be withdrawn from Spain, remain there \\"for the duration\\". However, Spain becomes a backwater, forgotten by the rest of the world with the spotlight turned elsewhere. Both Spanish sides are starved of supplies by their respective patrons, which need the munitions for higher priority fronts. The Spanish war becomes stalemated, with neither side able to make any decisive move. Sanjurjo turns his attention to conquering Gibraltar, the British enclave ceded to Britain in perpetuity by Spain by the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht. Spanish Nationalist troops suffer heavy losses from the naval artillery of the moored British warships, but with the aerial support of the German Condor Legion, British resistance is overcome, and the Royal Navy ships are forced to withdraw into the open sea. The conquest of Gibraltar is a fillip to both Spanish national pride and Sanjurjo's personal reputation and might have strategic implications for later stages of the war in the Mediterranean theatre. However, by depriving the British of a highly valued strategic asset, Sanjurjo irrevocably ties the Spanish Nationalist cause with that of Germany and so foreclosing any chance of surviving in power after a German defeat.In actual history, Germany prepared Operation Felix, a plan for occupying Gibraltar, but Francisco Franco opposed its implementation. Towards mid-1939, the long-deadlocked Madrid front becomes active, with both sides moving reinforcements there. The Nationalists aim to finally conquer the city, and the Republicans, who deploy the International Brigades there, seek to push them away decisively and end any further threat to the Spanish capital.  The Soviet war with Poland and Germany  After having taken a minor part in the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia, the staunchly anti- communist Polish government openly moves to the side of Germany since it considers Adolf Hitler to be a more tolerable neighbor than Joseph Stalin. Consequently, Polish-Soviet tensions grow until they finally erupt into open war, with Stalin accusing Poland of oppressing its Belarusian minority and then launching an invasion with the proclaimed aim of liberating them. The true objective is to regain formerly Russian territory that Soviet Russia had ceded to Poland in 1921 after the Soviet-Polish War. The Poles ask for German aid, become Hitler's formal ally, and receive some military assistance, mainly in the form of Luftwaffe fighters. The Soviet advance stalls because of the staunch Polish and German resistance and the harsh midwinter conditions, as well as the poor logistical situation for the Red Army. Though not committing ground troops en masse, Germany finds itself fighting a two-front war, its nightmare from the First World War, which increases the urgency of quickly winning a decisive victory on the Western Front. It also means that for the time being, Germany can spare no resources for the conquest of Denmark and Norway. While air raid regulations and wartime rationing become part of daily life in both London and Berlin, neutral Copenhagen has life goes on as usual. Japanese invasion of Siberia For some years, there had been a power struggle within the Japanese military and political establishment, with the Japanese Navy arguing for a war aimed at wrestling control of the Pacific from the United States (Nanshin-ron), and the generals, particularly those of the powerful Kwantung Army, preferred an attack on the Soviet Union (Hokushin-ron) as an extension of Japan's ongoing conquest of China. The Soviet Union's entanglement with Germany and Poland tips the balance in favour of the Kwantung generals. The Japanese shift from an undeclared, low-intensity border war with the Soviets along the Mongolian border to an all-out invasion of Siberia, with the clear strategic aim of cutting the Trans-Siberian Railway, the only long extended supply line to Vladivostok. Cutting the line would mean that the city and the rest of the Soviet Far East would swiftly become untenable and fall into Japanese hands. Well aware of that, the Soviets fiercely contest the Japanese advance north of the Amur River and hold the invaders away from the vital railway line. Meanwhile, the Americans present in Japanese-occupied China at the American Legation in Peking and elsewhere are worried about the increasing arrogance and expansion of the Japanese Empire. However, decision-makers in Washington, DC, are content to see the Japanese direct their aggressive energy at the Soviets, and the Americans keep supplying Japan with fuel and scrap metal and so effectively tacitly support the Japanese war effort. Invasion of the Low Countries and Northern France In the winter of 1939, world attention shifts away from the other war theatres to the Western Front, where the German Army launches its bold effort to implement Fall Gelb (Case Yellow) by using the armoured striking force that it had lacked in the previous war. The Germans knock France altogether out of the war after they began by launching a massive surprise attack on the neutral Netherlands. The Dutch Army, caught completely unprepared, resists until German bombers inflict heavy damage on defenseless Rotterdam. Rather than have more of their cities suffer the same fate, the Dutch government surrenders after five days. Belgium, which had refused to let French and British forces deploy on its soil, belatedly allows them after the Germans invade it. After three weeks of fighting, Belgium is overrun and King Leopold, who was never enthusiastic about waging the war, surrenders. The Germans then invade northern France, bypassing the Maginot Line by way of the Ardennes. Although the French are repeatedly driven back, the force of the German Blitzkrieg is not as overwhelming if the German arms industry had received another year to produce more advanced tanks. With the war launched in 1938, the Germans must rely heavily on the Panzer I, a light tank that was intended originally for training. Also, with an active Eastern Front against the Soviets, the Wehrmacht is unable to concentrate all of its forces in the west. Much of the Allies' armaments are inadequate or obsolete as well, with artillery antedating World War I and air forces still having many biplanes, which sometimes hold their own against more-modern types. Still, the Allies are not broken and wage a fighting retreat more and more deeply into France. Though Dunkirk and other Channel ports are conquered by the Germans, making communications with Britain difficult, the British Expeditionary Force remains united with its French ally, some Belgian forces that continue to fight despite their country's surrender. Highly-motivated Czechoslovak exile troops also aid in the battle. Disaffection in the German Army and the Battle of Paris The continuation of bitter fighting and the absence of the expected French collapse causes disappointment among German officers, who feel that Hitler acted precipitously in launching the war. A conspiracy of conservative officers is foiled by the Gestapo, with them being executed or sent to the Dachau concentration camp. In the aftermath, a widespread witch hunt is launched throughout the German Army that targets many completely-innocent officers, which increases the feeling of frustration and disaffection in the German ranks, combined with to the increasing fatigue of the ongoing difficult fighting. The Germans advance southwards, capture Verdun without the massive toll exacted there in the previous war, advance farther south than in the 1914 Battle of the Marne, and penetrate the outskirts of Paris. The French capital is heavily bombed, with the Eiffel Tower destroyed. Although neither Edouard Daladier nor Neville Chamberlain are inspiring war leaders, resistance continues with the defiant proclamation: \\"Paris is the front, here we will stop them.\\" The Allies also start deploying armored forces effectively after they learn from their German opponents, and the French command finally listens to the advice of its best armored warfare expert, Colonel Charles de Gaulle. The German forces prepare for a decisive push to surround and conquer Paris but are confronted by a massed force of determined French, British, Czechoslovak, and French Colonial African troops. The exhausted German soldiers are stopped and the Allies, to their own soldiers' surprise, manage to start pushing them back. The Germans are in a predicament, with no strategic achievement to show for the months of grueling fighting and are overextended; also, their flank is threatened by French forces at the Maginot Line, which is bypassed but not defeated. The threatened Jews With Germany already straining its resources for external war in November 1938, there is no nationwide Kristallnacht involving pogroms and the burning of synagogues. Still, discrimination and persecution of Jews becomes ever more intensive and oppressive. Even Jews who are completely assimilated into German culture, who thought of themselves as patriotic Germans are driven beyond the pale and not allowed to join the army even when they want to, despite having served with distinction in the Great War, nor allowed to use the air raid shelters when Allied bombers start arriving overhead. The conquest of Czechoslovakia, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Northern France expose an increasing number of additional Jews to the racist brutality from which German Jews suffered since 1933. The Jews have no clear idea how far the Nazis intend to go, but they have many reasons to feel foreboding and start assuming that they could count themselves lucky to continue to be alive at the war's end.  West and East  The War That Came Early: West and East, published in July 2010, is the second book in the series. Both Germany and the Soviet Union are bogged down by a two-front war, and neither makes significant progress against the other in Eastern Europe. There is little change in the Spanish front in this book, and German Jews become forced to wear the Yellow Star, even as Polish Jews are fighting alongside German soldiers. The Siberian campaign The Japanese successfully sever the Trans-Siberian Railway, cutting off shipments to Vladivostok. Cold weather and mosquitoes take their toll on the Japanese soldiers, and skirmishes with Soviet partisans are common. Despite the distance from the industrial areas of Russia, Soviet forces maintain modest air and artillery superiority, but their accuracy is often doubtful, causing many casualties on both sides. Japanese attacks on Vladivostok proceed much like their attacks on Port Arthur in 1904, suffering tremendous casualties and gaining very little ground. The War in the West The Germans have slowly introduced the Panzer III, a tank with thicker armor and a turret large enough for the whole gun crew. It proves formidable against its French counterparts, but the arrival is delayed by a lack of resources and the diversion of most German armored units to the Eastern Front in Poland. The Germans completely occupy Denmark and fight with the British in Norway. Sweden displays its neutrality by printing both Allied and Nazi propaganda, but Stockholm is still heavily fortified to defend Sweden's independence. German U-boats are forced to take extra measures to avoid targeting neutral merchant ships in the hope of avoiding American involvement in the war, and they experiment with the snorkel. The British and French successfully launch an offensive, driving the Germans into a slow retreat towards the French border. Some of the German High Command launch another coup against Hitler, but that is put down as well as the previous one. In the aftermath, many Germans who are suspected of being disloyal, from ordinary privates to generals, are arrested by the SS and Gestapo. Eastern Front Germany increases its commitments to Poland, sending Panzers and infantry to cut off the Russians in the disputed territory. In response, the Russians escalate the war, launching a full-scale invasion that drives as far as the Vistula before they are stopped and driven back. Japanese occupation of China Tension mounts between American forces stationed in Shanghai and the Japanese Imperial Army. The Japanese and well-to-do Chinese collaborators drink in fancy bars, and the Japanese show off their success in Russia, likening it to the 1905 Russo-Japanese War.  The Big Switch  The War That Came Early: The Big Switch, published in July 2011, is the third book in the series. The big switch referred to in the title is that of France and the United Kingdom, as they join Germany in its war against the Soviet Union. At the end of the book, the Japanese assault on the European colonial powers and the United States begins.  Japanese-Soviet War  The Russians at Vladivostok finally surrender for a lack of food. A shortage of trained bomber pilots in the Far East makes the Soviets take experienced copilots and retrain them as bomber pilots. The Japanese force their captured Russian prisoners to go to a Unit 731 facility, like in the Bataan Death March, where they are experimented on by the Japanese. The Soviet peace with the Japanese sets the new border at the current front line and so the Red Army can concentrate on its western enemies.  The War in the West  The Germans slowly retreat as the British and French counterattack. The Allies evacuate Norway, leaving it to the Germans. Rudolf Hess parachutes into Scotland in a bid to convince Britain and France to join Germany and Poland in their campaign against the Soviet Union. Winston Churchill is the primary voice of opposition, but he dies in an apparent accident after he is hit by a drunk driver. The Allies agree to the plan, sending their troops into Russia to fight the Soviets. The German Army withdraws from France and is only slightly harried by a few stubborn francs-tireurs. The Czechoslovaks, who continued to fight after their defeat, are disgusted and head to Spain to fight the fascists there. A few groups in France and Britain, mainly of disaffected soldiers and politicians, wonder if a coup may be necessary to stop their countries' descents into police states, and Roosevelt suspends Lend Lease aid to the Western Allies.  The Advance into Russia  The Germans and their Polish allies drive the Soviets out of Poland and into Belorussia. The Soviets suffer many major defeats, and the German army is at the gates of Smolensk when the winter starts. British and French troops arrive to bolster the German and Polish defense against the Russian counterattacks. The obsolescent SB-2 is consigned to night bombing missions, as the much-better Pe-2 is now available and the SB-2 is unable to defend itself against fighters such as the Bf 109. The Soviets take a measure of revenge on the British by attacking the Royal Navy base at Scapa Flow with long-range bombers. The Baltic Sea is dangerous waters for both sides, as it teems with mines and patrol aircraft.  Japanese- American-French-British-Dutch War  Roosevelt, alarmed at Japan's aggression, freezes the flow of oil and raw materials to Japan. Soon, on Sunday, January 12, 1941, Japan launches surprise attacks on French Indochina, the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies, Hong Kong, Malaya, Hawaii, and a few minor targets. The Cavite-based Asiatic Fleet is devastated. At Pearl Harbor, the Americans are warned of the attack and so lose only a carrier, a battleship, and some fuel storage facilities.  Spanish Civil War  The Spanish Civil War is a stalemate, which does not change throughout the book. When France switches sides, the Czech regiment is sent to Spain to help the Republicans.  The Threatened Jews  Jews in Germany are forced to bear a new name. Jewish males have the new first name of Moses, and Jewish females have the new name of Sarah, but both can still live a more-or-less normal lives in their homes. In Czechoslovakia, the country's entire Jewish population is consigned to a ghetto in Theresienstadt. The worst is the fate of Jews in the German-occupied parts of the Soviet Union: captured Red Army soldiers are killed out of hand, Jewish civilians in captured towns are subjected to cruel harassment, and the American press has stories of systematic massacres. Polish Jews remain protected by Poland being an ally of Germany and so German soldiers there are ordered not to interfere with local Jews.  Coup d'√âtat  The War That Came Early: Coup d'Etat, published in July 2012, is the fourth book in the series. In this volume, the situation of the war changes once again, with a military coup in Britain turning them against the Nazis and their allies fighting the Soviets. In the Pacific, throughout 1941, the Japanese gain ground throughout South East Asia with the Western powers unable to prevent it. The War in the West and North Africa The war in North Africa is very desultory as the reluctant and badly equipped Italian Army is defeated again and again by the British. Eastern Front Japanese-American War After the initial Japanese surprise attack, the US Navy deploys the Pacific Fleet to seek and destroy the Imperial Japanese Navy's Combined Fleet, and retake islands captured in the opening battles. However, the plan fails, as the Pacific Fleet is continuously attacked by Japanese aircraft, flying from the captured islands. After suffering heavy losses, including the flagship USS Arizona, the Americans are forced to return to Pearl Harbor, leaving any US forces on recaptured islands stranded and without support. The Japanese take Midway Island away from the American forces there, and start a bombing campaign against the Hawaii. All US Navy front-line aircraft carriers, except for the USS Ranger, are sunk at the Battle of Midway. The USS Boise is assigned to escort the USS Ranger, but Japanese aircraft again attack the ship, and sink the Boise with two direct hits.  Two Fronts  The War That Came Early: Two Fronts, published in July 2013, is the fifth book in the series and spans the period 1942 ‚Äì early 1943. The French and British are now fighting the Germans in Belgium, while the Germans also have to continue battling the Soviets in the east. Due to the shift of manpower to the Western Front, Germany is now starting to lose ground in Russia. On the other side of the world, Japan begins launching biological attacks against the US. North Africa British forces are pushed back towards Egypt when the Afrika Korps arrives under the command of Walther Model. Field Marshal Montgomery is killed when his transport plane is shot down by the Germans and is subsequently replaced by Claude Auchinleck. Western Front The Germans are forced to transfer substantial numbers of men and amounts of equipment from Russia to the reopened Western Front. French and British troops stranded in the Soviet Union are also shipped back to France and Britain. After reversing the pro-Nazi coup in the British government, leaders of the plot are assigned to minor diplomatic posts far from London to prevent future collaboration, though their sympathizers remain in England, largely unknown. The 1942 US elections change little with a few Democrat seats being lost, but the United States remains out of the European theater of war. FDR does sell/send Britain some B-17 bombers that the RAF uses for daylight bombing raids of German cities. FDR eliminates funding for work on an atomic bomb in Tennessee, on the advice that the project is unlikely to yield results for the amount of money it requires. The German U-boat U-30 sinks the British Navy's aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal. Following the second insurrection in M√ºnster, the SS begin another purge of the military, removing anyone with connection to M√ºnster from duty. Eastern Front Due to the shift of manpower to the Western Front, Germany is now starting to lose ground in Russia, with just enough soldiers left to slow the Soviet advance. The biggest difference is Germany's use of Panzer IVs as medium battle tanks instead of just infantry support. They receive larger guns (75 mm vs the 50 mm of Panzer IIIs) and better armament so that they can now go toe-to-toe with Russian T-34 tanks. The bigger shock for the Russians is newer German Tiger I heavy tanks (Panzer VIs) with their 88mm guns that are true \\"tank killers\\". There is no mention of the Panzer V (Panther) tank. The German Luftwaffe also introduces FW-190s into the mix to aid the older Bf 109s. The book ends with the Red Army breaking through German lines and advancing on the town of Horki in Belarus. Japanese-American War In the Pacific, the Japanese are at a standstill. While they now have Midway, they still haven't taken the Hawaiian Islands. The US Navy's stock of fleet carriers is reduced to a single surviving vessel () to protect the Islands, but is later joined by two \\"baby flattops\\" (converted merchant vessels that each possess only half the aircraft capacity of the Ranger). From Midway, Japanese launch a biological attack against the Islands by dropping canisters of plague infested fleas living on rats. However, the United States is apparently prepared for this, as it frequently issues vaccinations to servicemen, countering each new disease the Japanese send.  Spanish Civil War  Despite General Franco's death by a sniper, little changes in Spain as both sides still receive only limited support from their respective allies. However, now that France is fighting the Germans once again on the Western Front, the regiment of Czechs are requested by the French government to return to France to help the French Republic fight the Germans in Belgium. The Czechs, remembering France's earlier betrayal, are wary of France's intentions and continue fighting around Madrid. The Nationalist forces receive assistance from the German \\"Legion Kondor\\", though the German officers are regularly targeted by Republican snipers.  The threatened Jews  Life for the Jews in Germany, what little there is, goes on as before. Strict rules and curfews with no relief is combined with miserable treatment by the Nazi authorizes. The RAF starts daylight bombing raids on German cities that kill both Jew and German alike. On one bombing raid, the Bruck family is killed when their bakery/home is destroyed by bombs from RAF B-17s purchased from the USA. Sarah Bruck survives because she was out shopping at the time, but the Nazi government takes the remaining property and assets of the bakery just the same. A demonstration in front of M√ºnster Cathedral demanding the release of the imprisoned Archbishop Clemens August Graf von Galen turns into a slaughter as members of the Gestapo open fire on the crowd. Waffen-SS troops enter M√ºnster to restore order and close off the plaza in front of the cathedral to the public. Rumors go around that the SS troops were brought in after the Wehrmacht refused to do so. Anti-SS sentiment continues to grow in the city.  Last Orders  The last novel of the series takes place from late 1943 to 1944. The Americans launch an airborne invasion that retakes Midway Island, and a military coup takes place in Germany. Hitler is killed, and Germany is plunged into a brief civil war. As the new German government negotiates peace with the Allied powers, Germany withdraws from most of the territories that it conquered, but the British and French allow Germany to retain rule over what was Czechoslovakia, even though the German invasion of that country was the original cause of the war. The Baltic states and the Vilnius region become part of the Soviet Union, and in the other parts of Eastern Europe, the prewar anti-communist dictators retain their rule, such as Ion Antonescu in Romania and Mikl√≥s Horthy in Hungary. Stalin deploys troops into the eastern Russia, hinting at a new Russo-Japanese war to retake Vladivostok, and he concludes an alliance with the United States, still involved in the war with Japan. Jews in Germany have survived the years of Nazi harassment, and the new military government returns their citizenship and full rights. The conservative German generals restore the flag of Imperial Germany, rather than that of the short-lived Weimar Republic, and Germany seems headed for an open-ended military dictatorship that is nationalist and militarist but not Nazi. Albert Einstein meets with Peggy Druce to find her ex-husband, Herbert, to try and convince him to continue funding the Manhattan Project since the military-ruled Germany might get the atomic bomb first. Britain also remains under military rule. The British generals promise to hold elections and restore parliamentary democracy, but they avoid setting a date. Military or civilian, the government faces the prospect of dissolution of the British Empire, like in our timeline. In Spain, Vaclav Jezek kills Nationalist leader General Sanjurjo, the Nationalist forces eventually surrender, and Spain is finally united under the left-wing Spanish Republic. Butterfly effect Altogether, the series could be seen as a major display of the butterfly effect. The single act by a single person (a Czech nationalist killing Konrad Henlein in 1938) has wider and wider ramifications, resulting seven years later in a world completely different from the 1945 that we know. Instead of the Americans and Soviets facing each other in the middle of occupied Germany, in the altered history Germany has remained the undefeated, dominant European power, its military might virtually intact, with no American military presence in Europe and the Soviets still on its eastern margins. Obviously, its 1950s and 1960s will also be nothing like those we know.  Characters   Viewpoint characters  Both historical viewpoint characters are marked as such. = Allied combatants = * Luc Harcourt (d. 1941) ‚Äî A young French soldier caught in the struggle to defend his country. He rises from private to sergeant during his service, fighting at the start of the war in western Germany and then defending the Low Countries and France. His unit is sent to fight the Soviet Union after France switches sides in The Big Switch. He is killed by Willi Dernen when the French contingent escapes to the Soviet lines in Coup D'Etat. * Aristide Demange ‚Äî A veteran of the Great War and Harcourt's superior. He is promoted from sergeant to lieutenant as the war goes on but still talks and acts like a no-nonsense noncom. He is almost always seen chainsmoking Gitanes cigarettes. Demange becomes a viewpoint character at the end of Coup D'Etat when Harcourt is killed as his unit crosses over to the Soviet lines. When the Western Front reopens, he and his unit are eventually \\"escorted\\" out of Russia, and he returns to France, where his unit fights the Germans in Belgium. * Vaclav Jezek ‚Äî A Czech soldier who sees action in Czechoslovakia before its defeat and again in France. It is during the fighting in France that he obtains his signature weapon, an \\"obsolete\\" antitank rifle, which he uses as a sniper rifle. His unit is expelled from France when the French ally with Germany in The Big Switch. The Czechs move to Spain to fight the fascists in the Spanish Civil War. He kills General Francisco Franco with his antitank rifle and later high-ranking German officers who advise the Nationalists. Jezek goes on to stop a Nationalist armored assault by destroying three Italian-made CV33 tankettes. Some time later, he is recognized for his efforts, given a medal, money, and leave in Madrid, where he meets Chaim Weinberg who is recuperating from his latest wounds. He returns to the front and later kills Marshal Sanjurjo, causing a complete collapse of the Nationalist front. Furious that the final peace left Germany in occupation of his beloved country, he heads home, takes his big gun, and is determined to cause the German occupiers as much trouble as possible. * Alistair Walsh ‚Äî A Great War veteran and British staff sergeant of the British Expeditionary Force, Walsh first fights the Germans in Belgium and then France before he is transferred to Norway. He is evacuated from there, and on leave, on leave in Scotland he takes Rudolf Hess into custody. He resigns from the Army after the Big Switch and is drawn into Ronald Cartland's clique against Horace Wilson. After it seizes power from the Wilson regime in Coup D'Etat, he re-enlists and is sent to North Africa to fight the Italians. After the British are driven back by Walther Model's Afrika Korps, and Field Marshal Montgomery is killed, Staff Sergeant Walsh is transferred back to England, where he meets some Members of Parliament again who lead the retaking of the government away from the pro-German faction. He then finds himself in western Belgium in a second Battle of the Somme. The British bombard German positions for days before attacking, this time with tank support. However, the British and French tanks are no match for the heavily armored German Tiger tanks, and the British assault is stopped dead in its tracks, with Walsh stuck in the middle of no man's land. * Chaim Weinberg ‚Äî An American International Brigadier and New York City Jew fighting for the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War. He meets \\"La Martellita,\\" a feisty female Spanish Republican, ardent communist, and local Spanish unit commander. He gets her pregnant after he walks her home drunk one night (he happened upon the same bar where she was drinking heavily during The Big Switch when he is certain that it means the end of the Republic). She is very angry with him for her new condition but insists on marrying him so that her child will be legitimate and have a proper last name. A son, Carlos Federico Weinberg, is born, and she quickly divorces him and wants nothing more to do with him. Chaim goes back to the front lines and gets himself shot up. La Martellita visits him in the hospital and brings the newborn along for him to see. She reminds Chaim that she still wants nothing to do with him and apparently starts dating a Soviet political officer. After he recovers, he goes back up to the front lines, where he meets an old friend, Mike Carroll. The Nationalists start a mortar bombardment at their line, and they are both hit. The mortar kills Mike Carroll and mashes Chaim's left hand and side of his head. Chaim is sent back to the hospital, where his head wound is bandaged and his hand has the first of a large number of many operations. Recuperating in Madrid, he runs into another old friend, Vaclav Jezek, where they spend an evening of retelling war stories and killing a bottle of rotgut cognac. He eventually returns to the front and assists in the final push against the Nationalists before he observes the final surrender. With the victorious Republic turning increasingly intolerant of dissent, he feels that he might have overstayed his welcome and returns to New York City. * Pete McGill ‚Äî An American China Marine stationed at the American Legation in Peking, China. He witnesses growing tensions in the Far East and is later reassigned to the Shanghai International Settlement. He falls in love with a White Russian taxi dancer, but she is killed and McGill severely injured in a communist terror bombing. He recuperates in a military hospital in Manila while the Japanese invade the Philippines and bomb Pearl Harbor. He is then assigned to the , which takes part in the inconclusive US drive against Japanese possessions in the Central Pacific. The Boise is sunk by a Japanese submarine, and McGill narrowly escapes death before he is rescued. He recovers in the Hawaiian Islands and is assigned to the fleet carrier USS Ranger as a gunner. He later trains as a paramarine and takes part in the recapture of Midway. * Sergei Yaroslavsky (d. 1940) ‚Äî A Soviet Red Air Force bomber pilot, he aids Czechoslovakia and later serves in the war against Poland and Germany. He is killed when his parachute catches fire while he bails out of his damaged SB-2 in The Big Switch. * Anastas Mouradian ‚Äî Introduced as Yaroslavsky's co-pilot, he becomes a viewpoint character in The Big Switch. He is promoted to first lieutenant and full pilot before he joins the defense against the Japanese invasion of Siberia. After Vladivostok falls, Mouradin is reassigned to the war against Germany and gets to fly the new Pe-2 bomber. * Ivan Kuchkov ‚Äî Yaroslavsky's bombardier, also known as \\"the Chimp\\" buy not to his face. Kuchkov becomes a viewpoint character in Coup D'Etat after he survives getting shot down with Yaroslavsky and is conscripted into the Red Army as an infantryman. Kuchkov rises to command a squad but is almost sent to a penal battalion when one of his privates accidentally shoots and kills their unit's political officer after he had refused to give the correct password for the day. He and the private are exonerated when both NKVD investigators agree that it would take more paperwork for them to get them into the penal battalion then if they were to report that it was an accident. He and his squad are later moved to the east, where they are arrested again by NKVD officers.  Axis combatants  * Kapit√§nleutnant Fritz-Julius Lemp (historical) ‚Äî U-boat captain of the who accidentally sinks the , leading to a diplomatic incident with the United States. As a result, his boat is given the hazardous task of field testing a new experimental piece of equipment, a \\"snorkel\\", which is designed to increase the submarine's speed when it is slightly submerged below the surface. Lemp finally gets promoted to lieutenant commander after he and his crew sink the British aircraft carrier . * Leutnant Hans-Ulrich Rudel (historical) ‚Äî A German Stuka pilot and preacher's son, he has always been loyal to the party above all else, even God. Thus, he is approached by the SS who wants him to become an informant. Rudel starts to show deviation from his initial fanaticism as he protects his outspoken tail gunner and falls in love with a half-Jewish barmaid in Poland. In Two Fronts, he and his squadron are sent back to Germany to fight on the Western Front. As in real life, Rudel is a pioneer in the use of aerial tank-busting cannon. * Joaquin Delgadillo (d. 1939) ‚Äî A Spanish Nationalist foot soldier in the Spanish Civil War, he is fervent supporter of the Nationalist cause. He participates in the seizure of Gibraltar before he is sent to Madrid. After Delgadillo is taken prisoner Chaim Weinberg tries to re-educate him, but Delgadillo eventually decides to be his own man. He escapes during an air raid but is killed almost immediately by a bomb. * Willi Dernen (d. 1942) ‚Äî A German Wehrmacht infantryman who sees action in France, where he is trained as a sharpshooter by snipers sent to hunt Vaclav Jezek. Dernen is later dispatched to the Soviet Union, where he is eventually shot in the head by advancing Soviet troops in Two Fronts. * Arno Baatz ‚Äì An Unteroffizier leading Willi Dernen's squad, he is derided as \\"Awful Arno\\" behind his back and despised by his men for his unpleasant personality and petty adherence to army regulations. When he becomes a viewpoint character after Dernen's death in Two Fronts, Baatz's behavior is revealed to be actually motivated by concern for his men's welfare, but he genuinely fails to understand why he is hated so much. He remains loyal to the Nazi cause and takes shelter with them in the M√ºnster town hall. Baatz assists in an assault against an enemy artillery piece but is assumed to have died during the attack. * Hideki Fujita ‚Äî A Japanese Army sergeant stationed in Manchukuo who first sees action against the Soviet Union. After the fall of Vladivostok, he escorts Soviet prisoners to a Unit 731 facility and serves as a guard there. After the war against the US begins, he is reassigned to Unit 113, another biological weapons unit, in Burma when captured US soldiers escape from his custody. Eventually tiring of his assignment, Fujita requests and receives a transfer to a flying unit that drops biological bombs on the Chinese. His unit commander then asks him to join him and some handpicked others in the unit to move to Midway Island, where he operates as a bombardier on a bomber that drops chemical weapons on the Hawaiian Islands, to little effect. He is later killed assaulting a hill on Midway, as American Paramarines launch an airborne invasion of the island. * Ludwig Rothe (d. 1939) ‚Äî A German Wehrmacht Panzer II commander who takes part in the invasions of Czechoslovakia, the Low Countries, and France. He is alternately amused and annoyed by the eccentricities of his crewmates: Rothe's driver is hypersexual and his radio operator, Theo Hossbach, is a willful recluse. Roethe is forced to bail out of his damaged panzer at the end of Hitler's War and is killed by Harcourt. *Theodosius \\"Theo\\" Hossbach ‚Äì A German Wehrmacht Panzer II radioman who serves under Ludwig Rothe, he is wounded when Rothe is killed. Hossbach serves in a new Panzer II on the Eastern Front in West and East. One of his new crewmen is Adi Stoss, an alias used by Sarah Goldman's brother upon joining the Wehrmacht. Hossbach and his crew get a newer but used Panzer III in 1941 and then an upgraded new Panzer IV in 1943, only to have it destroyed by advancing Soviet tanks. Hossbach and his crew get out of their damaged panzer and are left looking for a way to escape the Soviet assault at the conclusion of Two Fronts. Members of his panzer crew are the driver Adi Stoss, the tank commander Sergeant Hermann Witt, and the gunner Private Kurt Poske. He and his unit are later reassigned to the outskirts of M√ºnster before they join the new German government forces in ousting Nazi- supporters from the town. Other characters * Peggy Druce ‚Äî An American civilian in Czechoslovakia at the time of the invasion who witnesses Nazi cruelty towards the Jews and finds herself unwillingly living in Berlin. She eventually makes her way home and speaks out against the Nazis. After she finds out that her husband, Herb Druce, had an affair while she was trapped in Germany, she admits to having a one-night stand with an employee of the US Embassy in Berlin. Their marriage goes downhill from here. She tries to salvage it, but her husband goes off on long business trips for the US government to attempt to save it money. On one of his trips, he apparently convinces authorities to cancel the Manhattan Project since he considers it an expensive pipe dream. In Reno, Nevada, he sends her divorce papers. She agrees to the divorce vut is not happy with it. She starts hitting the bottle more and more as time goes by, but she still makes political speeches for the Democratic Party and President Franklin Roosevelt. * Sarah Bruck (n√©e Goldman) ‚Äî A teenage German Jew from M√ºnster who, along with her family, struggles to live day to day in the face of Nazi anti-Semitism. She falls in love with and marries Isidor Bruck, the local Jewish baker's son. After being married to Isidor for only a short time, her husband's family bakery is destroyed during a British daylight bombing raid. Isidor and his parents are killed in the blast. Sarah survives, as she was out shopping, but then discovers that the Nazi government is taking ownership of their property and other assets for the \\"good of the Reich,\\" leaving her with nothing.

A Great Jubilee Day A Great Jubilee Day, first organized May 26, 1783 in North Stratford, now Trumbull, Connecticut, celebrated end of major fighting in the American Revolutionary War. Bennington Battle Day Bennington Battle Day is a state holiday unique to Vermont which commemorates the American victory at the Battle of Bennington (which actually took place in New York) during the Revolutionary War in 1777. The holiday's date is fixed, and occurs on August 16 every year. In Bennington, there is a battle re- enactment put on by the local history foundation. This may be the only state holiday in the US which commemorates an event that did not even happen in the state. The Battle of Bennington is named as such, because the battle was over weapons and munitions stored where the Bennington Battle monument now stands. This site is located in what is now referred to as Old Bennington.Bennington's Official Website Carolina Day Carolina Day is the day set aside to commemorate the first decisive victory of the American Revolutionary War in South Carolina. History Sgt. Jasper raising battle flag during the Battle of Sullivan's Island. On June 28, 1776, a small band of South Carolina Patriots defeated the British Royal Navy in the Battle of Sullivan's Island. Patriots stationed at an unfinished palmetto log and sand fort near what is today Fort Moultrie defeated a British naval force of nine warships as it attempted to invade Charleston. After a nine-hour battle, the ships were forced to retire. Charleston was saved from British occupation, and the fort was named in honor of its commander, General William Moultrie. The victory put off a British occupation for four years. The Liberty Flag designed by Colonel William Moultrie and waved by Sergeant William Jasper to rally the troops during that battle became the basis for the Flag of South Carolina, bearing on it an image of the palmetto tree that was used to build the fortress. Holiday The anniversary of the victory was celebrated locally starting in 1777 when it was known as Palmetto Day or Sergeant Jasper's Day. (The latter name was a reference to a colonial soldier who had rushed into the fight to save the fallen battle flag during the battle). The anniversary became known as Carolina Day for the first time in 1875. The anniversary remained popular until the mid-20th century but eventually began to fall out of favor. Regardless, the day continued to be marked by the tradition of playing the tune of \\"Three Blind Mice\\" at noon at St. Michael's Episcopal Church (Charleston, South Carolina). In 1995, Charleston historical groups helped reinvigorate the celebration of Carolina Day to help raise awareness of South Carolina's and Charleston's role in the Revolutionary War. While the holiday has not regained the popularity it once enjoyed, it remains an official holiday in South Carolina although not marked by office closings. According to South Carolina Code Ann. sec. 53-3-140, \\"June twenty-eighth of each year, the anniversary of the Battle of Sullivan's Island in 1776, is declared to be 'Carolina Day' in South Carolina.\\" Founder's Day Founder's Day originated from a proclamation by the United States Continental Congress on October 11, 1782, in response to Great Britain's expected military defeat in the American Revolutionary War. The war did not formally end until Congress ratified the Treaty of Paris on January 14, 1784. The purpose of the proclamation was essentially to thank God for America's good fortune in the Revolutionary War. This did not form the basis for Thanksgiving Day as it is known presently in the United States. Congressional and presidential declarations named several days of thanks each year throughout the Revolutionary War period and after. This particular day of thanks falls on November 28.  Proclamation Text  By the United States in Congress assembled. PROCLAMATION.*** IT being the indispensable duty of all Nations, not only to offer up their supplications to ALMIGHTY GOD, the giver of all good, for his gracious assistance in a time of distress, but also in a solemn and public manner to give him praise for his goodness in general, and especially for great and signal interpositions of his providence in their behalf: Therefore, the United States in Congress assembled, taking into their consideration the many instances of divine goodness to these States, in the course of the important conflict in which they have been so long engaged; the present happy and promising state of public affairs; and the events of the war, in the course of the year now drawing to a close; particularly the harmony of the public Councils, which is so necessary to the success of the public cause; the perfect union and good understanding which has hitherto subsisted between them and their Allies, notwithstanding the artful and unwearied attempts of the common enemy to divide them; the success of the arms of the United States, and those of their Allies, and the acknowledgment of their independence by another European power, whose friendship and commerce must be of great and lasting advantage to these States: Do hereby recommend to the inhabitants of these States in general, to observe, and request the several States to interpose their authority in appointing and commanding the observation of THURSDAY the twenty-eight day of NOVEMBER next, as a day of solemn THANKSGIVING to GOD for all his mercies: and they do further recommend to all ranks, to testify to their gratitude to GOD for his goodness, by a cheerful obedience of his laws, and by promoting, each in his station, and by his influence, the practice of true and undefiled religion, which is the great foundation of public prosperity and national happiness. Done in Congress, at Philadelphia, the eleventh day of October, in the year of our LORD one thousand seven hundred and eighty-two, and of our Sovereignty and Independence, the seventh. John Hanson, President. Charles Thomson, Secretary. Halifax Day Halifax Day occurs on April 12 in Halifax, North Carolina. It celebrates the Halifax Resolves (which was the first official call for independence from Britain by any of the colonies) when it was voted unanimously that North Carolina's delegates to the Continental Congress be empowered to concur with the other colonial delegates in declaring independence from Britain. Until the 1980s, Halifax Day was celebrated by a public holiday in North Carolina. Every year, on April 12, the Historic Halifax State Historic Site hosts Halifax Day. Interpreters in period costumes guide tours of historic buildings, and demonstrate historic crafts and other colonial activities. Occasionally, reenactors portray Revolutionary era soldiers and demonstrate use of historic weapons during the Halifax Day events. Massacre Day Massacre Day was a holiday in Boston, Massachusetts, from 1771 to 1783. It was held on March 5, the anniversary of the 1770 Boston Massacre.Fowler, William M., Jr. The Baron of Beacon Hill: A Biography of John Hancock. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1980.Travers, Len.

Powder House Day Powder House Day in New Haven, Connecticut, is celebrated annually to commemorate the events of April 22, 1775 when the Governor's Foot Guard, under Captain Benedict Arnold, demanded the keys to the powder house in order to arm themselves and begin the march to Cambridge, Massachusetts, marking the entry of New Haven into the American Revolution. When news of the Battle of Lexington reached New Haven, Connecticut on April 21, 1775, the Second Company of the Governors Foot Guard voted to assist their fellow Massachusetts patriots. Although the New Haven town meeting had voted the day before not to send aid to Massachusetts, the Foot Guard decided overwhelmingly to go. With the blessing of the Rev. Jonathan Edwards they confronted the selectmen, who were meeting at a Beer's Tavern, and demanded access to the powder house. \\"You may tell the selectmen,\\" Arnold reportedly said, \\"that if the keys are not coming within five minutes, my men will break into the supply-house and help themselves. None but the Almighty God shall prevent me from marching.\\" The keys were reluctantly handed over and supplies and arms were taken for the march to Cambridge. On July 2, 1775 members of the Foot Guard escorted General George Washington to Cambridge after his overnight stay in New Haven on his way to Boston to take command of the forces around the Greater Boston area. The Governor's Foot Guard stages an annual recreation of the events on a Saturday in April. After a memorial service at New Haven's Center Church on the Green (the same church where Arnold's wife was later buried in the cellar cemetery), the re-enactors march across the Green to City Hall, where a member of the Foot Guard playing Arnold demands the keys to the powder house from the current mayor of New Haven, who plays his Revolutionary predecessor. Despite his later deeds Benedict Arnold is still considered an unnamed hero in Connecticut, though no memorial to him was ever built because of his treason.Osterweis, Rollin G., Three Centuries of New Haven (1953), New Haven: Yale University Press. Yorktown Day Yorktown Day is a holiday celebrated in Yorktown, Virginia, United States annually on October 19. The holiday celebrates the surrender of the British forces on that date in 1781, ending the Battle of Yorktown and bringing about the end of the American Revolutionary War. Typical events during the day include a parade, speeches from groups such as the Daughters of the American Revolution, wreath- laying at several gravesites in the area, and reenactments of the Battle and subsequent surrender.

Its primary function is as a location for Eucharistic adoration by the Sisters of Providence and members of the public. History Saint Mother Theodore Guerin, who came to Saint Mary-of-the-Woods, Indiana with several companions in 1840 and founded the Sisters of Providence, had a strong devotion to the Blessed Sacrament. In December 1913, Pope Pius X gave the sisters permission to hold perpetual Eucharistic adoration, which began at Saint Mary's in a different location on June 10, 1914. For decades the Sisters of Providence had wanted a specific Chapel of Perpetual Adoration, but this was not achieved until the 1920s under the leadership of General Superior Mother Mary Cleophas Foley. Ground was broken on April 9, 1920 and the cornerstone was laid on June 7 of that year. The building was consecrated on May 19, 1924, by Bishop Joseph Chartrand of the Archdiocese of Indianapolis. He designated the chapel Chapel of Divine Love, though the sisters referred to it simply as the Blessed Sacrament Chapel. Interior and art The chapel is built in the Italian Renaissance style with a barrel-vault ceiling. It was designed by D.A. Bohlen & Son of Indianapolis. Funded in large part through donations from the families and friends of Sisters of Providence, the chapel features multiple types of marble, gold, and silver. The chapel's focal point is a Carrara marble baldachin. Carved from one piece of marble by the Deprato Company of Pietrasanta, Italy, the baldachin weighs 8,000 pounds. Nine stained glass windows of Tiffany glass are found in the chapel: four on each side and one rose window of the Holy Spirit above the entrance. The windows were designed specifically for the space and were executed in the Royal Bavarian Studios in Munich, Germany. In order to encourage undivided attention on the Blessed Sacrament, no figures are pictured in the windows.

Tulip and Babe  In 1979, Marcha joined forces with former Teach-In singer Marianne Wolsink to form the duo Tulip. They had only released two singles however when, in 1981, Marcha was chosen from over 200 candidates as the replacement for the departing lead singer Gemma van Eck in girl group Babe, who had established themselves since 1979 as regular chart performers, with six top 30 singles in the Netherlands. Known as Marga Bult during this time, she recorded two albums and 14 singles with Babe, and toured extensively across Europe and Asia, before the group disbanded in June 1986.  Eurovision  In 1987, as a solo artist, Marcha was chosen by broadcaster NOS to be the Dutch singer for that year's Eurovision Song Contest, and in a selection of six songs, \\"Rechtop in de wind\\" (\\"Upright in the Wind\\") was chosen by regional juries as the country's entry.ESC National Finals 1987 At the 1987 Eurovision, held on 9 May in Brussels, \\"Rechtop in de wind\\" finished in joint fifth place of 22 entries.ESC History 1987\\"Rechtop in de wind\\" at diggiloo.net Marcha's appearance in Brussels is fondly remembered by Eurovision fans for her classic 1980s outfit and big hair.

It was in official use as the town cemetery from about 1810 to 1856, until Oconee Hill Cemetery opened. The last known burial was in 1898. Location and history The cemetery is situated on the University of Georgia (UGA) campus adjacent to the Lamar Dodd School of Art (Visual Arts Building to the north) and Baldwin Hall (to the south) Jackson Street (to the west), and Thomas Street (to the east), \\"on land that was originally part of the University's land grant from the state legislature, and the school apparently donated it to the city of Athens, though Duncan says there's no official record of the transaction\\". The cemetery land was deeded back to UGA in 2004. The University encroached on the cemetery's original six acres, reducing it to the two and one-half acres it now occupies. The University had wanted to build on the land and tried to assert title to it in 1890, but opposition scuttled their plans. > Cramped for campus space, the University vigorously pursued [the land title] > idea under Chancellor Hill. Graves were to be moved to Oconee Hill and the > site used for building, but his death in December, 1905 ended this campaign. In the 1920s plans to take over the Old cemetery were again proposed, and when Baldwin Hall was built (opened 1938) a couple of acres were indeed taken from the south end of the cemetery (and more for its parking lot). The cemetery was also targeted for use as a site for the Visual Arts Building (opened 1961), but this was \\"fended off\\" by the Athens Historical Society (while another slice of land was taken from the north end of the cemetery, as shown by old aerial photographs). Bodies were disturbed in this process: \\"workers back in the 1930s removed 120 wooden boxes filled with bones from where Baldwin Hall now sits, then buried them in two 95-foot trenches in or near a pauper cemetery\\", and a bit of \\"lore\\" says that UGA Dean, William Tate, \\"rode along with the procession to give it some dignity\\". In the fall of 1980 the University again proposed moving the graves to Oconee Hill, this time so that the cemetery land could be used for a parking deck. The coalition that fought this proposal \\"was the nucleus of the Old Athens Cemetery Foundation, Inc.\\" It argued that the legal problems that would result from the proposal would be stupendous.\\" The Old Athens Cemetery consisted of 'about six acres' in 1906 and now comprises two and a half acres. It has been a victim of the ravages of time and weather, as well as deliberate vandalism, and is the subject of an ongoing restoration project by Janine Duncan, of the University of Georgia Grounds Department. Contemporary disinterments On November 17, 2015, construction crews working on a renovation of Baldwin Hall discovered a human skull. Construction was paused, and additional graves have been located. \\"UGA is working closely with the appropriate state agencies to ensure that the remains from up to 27 gravesites are properly removed and re-interred.\\" A total 105 people's remains were removed, of which 30 had enough DNA for analysis. Of those, 27 were African American and would have been slaves. Leaders of the African American community in Athens want the remains to be reinterred in one of the predominately African American cemeteries in town, either Brooklyn Cemetery or Gospel Pilgrim Cemetery. However, UGA says that it is following the direction of the State Archaeologist's Office in placing the bodies in Oconee Hill Cemetery.

Types Alligator shear Bench shear File: bench shear is with a compound mechanism to increase the mechanical advantage. It is usually used for cutting rough shapes out of medium-sized pieces of sheet metal, but cannot do delicate work. For the small shear, it mostly designed for a wide field of applications. Light weight and easy efficient operation, yet very sturdy in construction. The cutting blades fitted are carefully and accurately ground to give easy, clean quick cuts, and free of burrs. These special features help the operators save a great deal of their energy. But some shearing machines can cut sheet bar and flat bar up to 10mm. It is electrically welded together to make it a sturdy stable unit capable to withstand highest stresses due to heavy duty usage. The footplates are reinforced with bracing angles so that they give firm stability to the shear. The machine is provided with section knives with sliding blades which can be adjusted by hand to make 90 cuts on angles and T-sections of different sizes as well as with openings for cutting round and square bars. Guillotine A hydraulic guillotine shear Close-up of upper blade, lower blade, backgauge and work-holding device of a Gasparini guillotine shear The machine used is called a squaring shear, power shear, or guillotine. The machine may be foot powered, less commonly hand powered, or mechanically or hydraulically powered. It works by first clamping the material with a ram. A moving blade then comes down across a fixed blade to shear the material. For larger shears the moving blade may be set on an angle or \\"rocked\\" in order to shear the material progressively from one side to the other; this angle is referred to as the shear angle. Setting the blade on an angle decreases the amount of force required, but increases the stroke. A 5-degree shear angle decreases the force by about 20%. The amount of energy used is still the same. The moving blade may also be inclined 0.5 to 2.5¬∞, called the rake angle, to keep the material from becoming wedged between the blades. However, raking the blade compromises the squareness of the edge. The machine consists of a shear table, work-holding device, upper and lower blades, and a gauging device. The shear table is the part of the machinery that the workpiece rests on while being sheared. The work-holding device is used to hold the workpiece in place and keep it from moving or buckling while under stress. The upper and lower blades are the piece of machinery that actually do the cutting, while the gauging device is used to ensure that the workpiece is being cut where it is supposed to be. The design of press tools is an engineering compromise. A sharp edge, strength, and durability are ideal, but a sharp edge is not very strong or durable, so blades for metal work tend to be square-edged rather than knife-edged. Typical workpiece materials include aluminum, brass, bronze, and mild steel because of their outstanding shearability ratings. Stainless steel is not sheared as often due to its tendencies to work-harden. Other geometric possibilities include the squaring shear, angle shear, bow-tie shear and bar shear. All of these have many different uses and are all used regularly in certain manufacturing fields. Power shears A power shear is electrically or pneumatically powered hand tool designed to blank large pieces of sheet metal. They are designed to cut straight lines and relatively large radius curves. They are advantageous over a bandsaw because there is not a size limit. Large versions can cut sheet metal up to 12 gauge. An alternative to the hand tools are hydraulically powered tools attached to heavy machinery. They are usually used to cut materials that are too bulky to be transported to a cutting facility, too big or dangerous for the hand tools and are stored at remote locations (e.g. mines, forests).Conveyor belt recycling and demolition shear Throatless shear Throatless shear Closeup of shear jaws A throatless shear is a cutting tool used to make complex straight and curved cuts in sheet metal. The throatless shear takes its name from the fact that the metal can be freely moved around the cutting blade (it does not have a throat down which metal must be fed), allowing great flexibility in shapes that can be cut.

He is known for his many portraits of notable Sussex people. The cult of the Sussex Martyrs is said to have been started using Hurdis's image of Richard Woodman burning as a Protestant martyr. Life An engraving by Hurdis James Henry Hurdis was baptised on 10 July 1800 at Saint James, Cowley, Oxfordshire. When he was a year old his father died in 1801 and his mother soon married a physician named Storer Ready, from Southampton. Hurdis was educated for ten years at King Edward VI School in Southampton and afterwards spent a few years in Abbeville in France following his stepfather's bankruptcy. Following his time in France, where he fished and hunted, he was apprenticed to the engraver Charles Heath. With Heath he learnt his regard for industry and art. He also learnt how to draw and etch. Hurdis was maintained by a private fortune and with that he was able to indulge his enthusiasm for engraving. Hurdis worked hard and shared his sense of humour with George Cruikshank; the two of them collaborated on some images that were sold as Cruikshanks. Hurdis lived at Newick, near Lewes, and etched a large number of portraits and views of Sussex buildings. His membership in the Sussex Archaeological Society meant that many of his drawings and etchings were published in their volumes. He created etchings of Sir George Shiffner, bart., and Mr. Partington of Offham. His rendition of the fete at Lewes to celebrate the coronation of Queen Victoria, and the \\"Burning of Richard Woodman at Lewes\\", from a picture by F. Colvin, were well regarded. The etching of Woodman and the other nine martyrs is credited with contributing to the \\"cult of the Sussex Martyrs\\".Christopher Whittick, ‚ÄòHurdis, James Henry (1800‚Äì1857)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 accessed 6 Nov 2009 Hurdis's first wife, Elizabeth (born Hutton), died in 1841 and he married Charlotte Jackson, who was ten years older than he was. Charlotte had been committed by her mother before their marriage. James and Charlotte had a daughter named Harriett Charlotte. Towards the end of his life Hurdis lived at Carlton Crescent in Southampton, where he died on 30 November 1857. There is a notable memorial to him, his wife and brother, and other members of the Hurdis family in Southampton Old Cemetery.

Looney Tunes animated short directed by Robert McKimson. The cartoon was released on November 14, 1953, and features Foghorn Leghorn, Miss Prissy and the Barnyard Dawg. The title is a play on John Steinbeck's 1937 novel Of Mice and Men. Foghorn Leghorn as usual is voiced by Mel Blanc, while an uncredited Bea Benaderet voicing all of the female hens. Plot The story opens with several hens mothering their chicks in an ideal suburban fashion: taking them on walks and bragging to fellow hens about their exploits. One of the hens jokingly tells Miss Prissy that she is lucky not to have chicks to look after, then Prissy overhears a group of hens saying that she will \\"never land a man\\" because she is \\"too much of a D-R- I-P.\\" This depresses Prissy, who then climbs up on to the roof of the barn. Meanwhile, Foghorn is seen preparing to attack the dog with a board from a picket fence when he sees Prissy jump from the top of the barn. Foghorn dives to catch her, and Prissy sees Foghorn as not only a savior but a potential husband, a notion which Foghorn rejects. Foghorn then goes about his regular routine, picking up the board and going to the doghouse, where he lifts the dog up by the tail and repeatedly slaps his rear end with the board which causes the dog to chase him. Foghorn then closes the gate to the fence just in time for the dog to crash into it head first. Foghorn is then seen trying to slip a lit dynamite stick into the dog house, but the dog is wise to it and the trick backfires. Foghorn is then seen having a picnic with a large amount of food prepared by Prissy, but Foghorn rejects her again. The dog sees Prissy's attempts to court Foghorn, and the dog tells her that she is going about it the wrong way and offers to help out, seeing it as a way to rid himself of Foghorn for good. The dog then disguises himself as a rival rooster who wants to marry Prissy, in order to make Foghorn jealous. The ruse works and Foghorn fights with the dog, knocking him out cold. Foghorn ends up in church exclaiming, \\"I won, I won!\\", as he and Prissy are married. When Foghorn realizes what happened, he says to the audience, \\"Hey, there must have been some way I could have lost.\\" He slaps himself to end the cartoon.

The constellation Ophiuchus, as defined by the 1930 International Astronomical Union's constellation boundaries, is situated behind the sun from November 29 to December 18. The idea appears to have originated in 1970 with Stephen Schmidt's suggestion of a 14-sign zodiac, also including Cetus as a sign. A 13-sign zodiac has been promulgated by Walter Berg and by Mark Yazaki in 1995, a suggestion that achieved some popularity in Japan, where Ophiuchus is known as . In sidereal and tropical astrology (including sun sign astrology), a 12-sign zodiac is used based on dividing the ecliptic into 12 equal parts rather than the IAU constellation boundaries. That is, astrological signs do not correspond to the constellations which are their namesakes, particularly not in the case of the tropical system where the divisions are fixed relative to the equinox, moving relative to the constellations. History Ophiuchus and some of the fixed stars in it were sometimes used by some astrologers in antiquity as extra-zodiacal indicators (i.e. astrologically significant celestial phenomena lying outside of the 12-sign zodiac proper). The constellation is described in the astrological poem of Marcus Manilius as the one that winds in loops: \\"But, bending its supple neck, the serpent looks back and returns: and the other's hands slide over the loosened coils. The struggle will last forever, since they wage it on level terms with equal powers\\".Manilius, Astronomica, I.333ff. Later in his poem, he describes the astrological influence of Ophiuchus, when the constellation is in its rising phase, as one which offers affinity with snakes and protection from poisons, saying \\"he renders the forms of snakes innocuous to those born under him. They will receive snakes into the folds of their flowing robes, and will exchange kisses with these poisonous monsters and suffer no harm\\".Manilius, Astronomica, V.389ff. A later 4th century astrologer, known as Anonymous of 379, associated \\"the bright star of Ophiuchus\\", Ras Alhague (Œ± Ophiuchi), with doctors, healers or physicians (·º∞Œ±œÑœÅ·ø∂ŒΩ), which may have been because of the association between poisons and medicines.Franz Cumont and Franz Boll, Catalogus Codicum Astrologorum Graecorum, Vol. 5, part 1, Brussels, 1904, pg. 210. Based on the 1930 IAU constellation boundaries, suggestions that \\"there are really 13 astrological signs\\" because \\"the Sun is in the sign of Ophiuchus\\" between November 30 and December 18 have been published since at least the 1970s.Lee T. Shapiro, The Real Constellations of the Zodiac , Planetarian, Spring 1977. Because of the tilt of the planes of the planets' paths relative to Earth's (the ecliptic), the planets actually pass through a number of other constellations as well, as was observed by John Mosely in The Real, Real Constellations of the Zodiac , Planetarian, Vol. 28, #4, December 1999. In 1970, Stephen Schmidt in his Astrology 14 advocated a 14-sign zodiac, introducing Ophiuchus (December 6 to December 31) and Cetus (May 12 to June 6) as new signs. Within 20th-century sidereal astrology, the idea was taken up by Walter Berg in the form of his book, The 13 Signs of the Zodiac (1995). In January 2011, a statement by Parke Kunkle of the Minnesota Planetarium Society repeating the idea of \\"the 13th zodiac sign Ophiuchus\\" made some headlines in the popular press.Howard Chua- Eoan, Welcome to the Zodiac, Ophiuchus.

Although these varieties are genetically distinct and will be adapted for different climates and cropping systems, their lifespan is so different from other kinds of rice that they are collectively called perennial rice. Perennial rice‚Äîlike many other perennial plants--can spread by horizontal stems below or just above the surface of the soil but they also reproduce sexually by producing flowers, pollen and seeds. As with any other grain crop, it is the seeds that are harvested and eaten by humans. Perennial rice is one of several perennial grains that have been proposed, researched or are being developed,Wagoner, P. (1990)Perennial grain development: past efforts and potential for the future. Critical reviews in plant sciences. 9(5):381-408 including perennial wheat, sunflower, and sorghum. Agronomists have argued that increasing the amount of agricultural landscapes covered at any given time with perennial crops is an excellent way to stabilize and improve the soil, and provide wildlife habitat.Reviewed in Cox, T.S., et al.

Perennial and annual rice Domesticated AsianAfrican rice, Oryza glaberrima is another domesticated rice. Its ancestor is strictly annual. The vast majority of the rice grown in the world--even in Africa--is Asian rice so, henceforth, \\"rice\\" in this article will refer only to Asian rice. rice, Oryza sativa is a short-lived plant. Most cultivars die after producing seeds, though some can regrow (ratoon) and produce a second crop under favorable conditions.Chauhan, J.S, B. S. Vergara, and F.S.S. Lopez. 1985. Rice ratooning. IRRI Res. Paper Ser. 102. IRRI, Manila, Philippines In regions with mild climates, two or three crops of rice may be grown each year. Except for ratoon crops, this means that the dead stalks must be removed, the soil cultivated, and new seed sown every few months. In contrast, the wild ancestor of Asian rice, Oryza rufipogon, often lives for many years, setting seed each year and spreading vegetatively.Kush, G.S. 1997. Origin, dispersal, cultivation and variation of rice. Plant Mol. Biol. 35:25-34 In addition to these perennial types, some O. rufipogon populations are annuals or intermediate in lifespanMorishiima, H., Y. Sano, and H.I. Oka. 1984. Differentiation of perennial and annual types due to habitat conditions in the wild rice O. perennis. Plant Syst. Evol. 114:119-135 Other wild species in the genus Oryza are also perennial. While perennial Oryza rufipogon spreads vegetatively by above-ground stems (stolons), O. longistaminata, O. officinalis, O. australiensis, O. rhizomatis spread by underground stems (rhizomes). Potential benefits Perennial plants can reduce soil erosion Erosion gulleys on unterraced hill farm in Yunnan Province Farm fields, especially those in the humid tropics, that have been cleared of vegetation or recently plowed are highly vulnerable to soil and nutrient loss through wind or water erosion, soil compaction, and decline in soil organic matter and microbial biomass. Eroded fields become less productive and the soil particles and dissolved nutrients cause environmental problems downstream, including hypoxia in oceans and rivers and the silting of reservoirs and waterways.Pimental, D., et al. (1987) World agriculture and soil erosion. Bioscience 37:277-283. Perennial plants regrow quickly after being harvested, re-establishing a protective cover. The fields do not need to be plowed after the initial planting.Glover, J.D. (2005) The necessity and possibility of perennial grain production systems. Renewable Agriculture and Food Systems. 20:1-4 Researchers at The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) believed that perennial rice would \\"improve the sustainability of food production in the hilly uplands and downstream.\\" Perennial rice could reduce the rate of deforestation Slash-and-burn agriculture has left only a few patches of forest on these hills in Yunnan Province. The light green patches are upland riceA high-yielding, nutritious, perennial cereal could allow poor farmers around the world to produce food on a plot of land indefinitely. Currently, many subsistence farmers clear plots in the forest for their crops. Once the soil and its nutrients have washed away, the plot is abandoned and a new piece of forest is slashed and burned. Forest may eventually regenerate on the abandoned plot, or weedy grasses may dominate. Environmental impacts of this cropping system include loss of biodiversity, carbon dioxide emissions, increased runoff and decreased rainfall.Tinkera, P.B.

Elliott (1979) Effect of Grass Species and Row Spacing on Dandelion Establishment and Growth. Canadian Journal of Plant Science 59:1031-1036 *Plant nutrition: While shallow rooted species, such as rice obtain most of their nutrients from the topsoil, deep rooted perennials can obtain significant proportion of their phosphorus from the subsoil. \\"Deep roots are especially important in nutrient- poor substrates because they increase the volume of soil exploited by the vegetation\\". *Reduce the need for transplanting, weeding, and other backbreaking labor. *More efficient use of applied fertilizer Potential disadvantages # Improved habitat for pests. If fields are not left bare for a portion of the year, rodents and insects populations may increase. Burning of the stubble of perennial rice could reduce these populations, but burning may not be permitted in some areas. Furthermore, rodents and insects living underground would survive burning, whereas tillage disrupts their habitat. # Makes crop rotation more difficult. Crop rotations with perennial systems are possible, but the full rotation will necessarily take longer. The slower pace of rotation‚Äîcompared with annual crops‚Äîcould allow a greater buildup of pathogens, pests or weeds in the perennial phase of the rotation. # Builds soil organic matter at the expense of plant productivity. In the absence of tillage, and in soils with depleted organic matter, crops with large root systems may build up organic matter to the point that nearly all of the soil nitrogen and phosphorus is immobilized. When this happens, productivity may decline until either the organic matter builds up to a level where equilibrium is reached between nutrient mineralization and nutrient immobilization or fertilizer is added to the system. # Hydrological impacts. Perennial plants may intercept and utilize more of the incoming rainfall. than annual plants each year. This may result in water tables dropping and/or reduced surface flow to rivers. # Reduced nutrient delivery to downstream farms. Wide replacement of annual with perennial plants on agricultural landscapes could stabilize soils and reduce nitrate leaching to the point that the delivery of sediment and dissolved nitrogen to downstream landscapes could be reduced. Farmers in these areas may currently rely on these nutrient inputs. On the other hand, other water usage sectors might benefit from improved water quality. Target environments for perennial rice Upland rice Upland rice growing amid the charred stumps of recently cleared forestUpland rice is grown on more than in the highlands of southern China and across southeast Asia.

National Agriculture and Forestry Research Institute. Vientiane, Lao PDR, pp. 139‚Äì148.PDF available This is a potent recipe for soil degradation. Were rice a perennial rather than an annual species, its continuously living roots and thick cover of vegetation would prevent such erosion, just as a planting of grass can prevent a roadside slope from washing away. Perennial rice could produce critically needed food year after year on the same plot of land without degrading the soil.Schmit, V., 1996 Improving sustainability in the uplands through the development of a perennial upland rice, pp. 265-273 in Upland Rice Research in Partnership, Proceedings of the Upland Rice Consortium Workshop, edited by Piggin C., B. Courtois, V.Schmit. 4‚Äì13 January 1996; Padang, Indonesia. Rainfed paddy rice bunded rice paddies in a Yunnan Province valley. 38 million ha (26%) of rice lands are terraced but unirrigated. This cropping system produces about 17% of world rice. While upland rice production systems were the initial target for the perennialization of rice, the perennial habit may prove to have benefits in paddy systems where erosion is less of a concern. Faced with drought one year and flooding the next, \\"...the rainfed rice farmer can usefully be thought of first as a manager of risk and uncertainty.\\"Anderson, J.R. (1995) Confronting uncertainty in rainfed rice farming: research challenges. In Fragile Lives in Fragile Ecosystems Proceedings of the International Rice Research Conference 13‚Äì17 February 1995. International Rice Research Institute, Los Ba√±os, Laguna, Philippineshttp://books.irri.org/9712200736_content.pdf Given the erratic moisture, many farmers do not use purchased fertilizers. With deforestation, manure may be used as cooking fuel making fertility a key problem. Where fertilizers are purchased, flooding can result in fertilizer runoff contaminating water systems. Rice with deeper roots, as would be predicted with perennial rice, could exploit the moisture and nutrients in a greater soil volume than short-rooted types (discussed above). The perennial habit could reduce the uncertainty of planting and transplanting with erratic rainfall patterns. Rhizomes would simply lie dormant until temperature and moisture conditions were adequate for emergence. Irrigated paddy rice Irrigated rice is very productive and this production method must be fairly sustainable, as it has been practiced in China for millenniaKing, F.H. (1911) Farmers of Forty Centuries, or Permanent Agriculture in China, Korea and Japan. Democrat Printing Co., Madison WI.available on Google Books however, high yielding rhizomatous rice varieties may still have some advantages, according to Dr. Dayun TaoTao Dayun1 and Prapa Sripichitt (2000) Preliminary Report on Transfer Traits of Vegetative Propagation from Wild Rice Species to Oryza sativa via Distant Hybridization and Embryo Rescue. Kasetsart J. (Nat. Sci.) 34 : 1 - 11. Available online *Fixing hybrid vigor: The first generation hybrids between two particular lines or individuals may be exceptionally good, but may be almost impossible to re-create. If the exceptional individual was perennial and rhizomatous, millions of genetically identical plants (clones) could be made from pieces of the rhizomes. *Expediting the production of inbred lines: Even if the final propagule for the farmers' fields is hybrid seed, not hybrid clones, the parents of exceptional F1 hybrids could be immediately clonally propagated if they were rhizomatous. These genetic replicas could be maintained indefinitely and crossed afresh each year to produce new F1 hybrid seed. Normally, re-creating parents using sexual reproduction requires many generations of inbreeding. *Ratoon cropping: In some environments, additional grain crops could be harvested each year if the plants ratooned quickly. Shoots growing from the mature plant can reach the reproductive stage more quickly than shoots growing from seed. Transplanting seedlings is faster than sowing seed, but still requires time and labor-intensive field preparation and, of course, a large supply of labor for transplanting. Other benefits can be imagined in this environment: *Reduce the need for transplanting, weeding, and other backbreaking labor. Because of migration to cities, many rural parts of Asia actually suffer from severe labor shortages. * More efficient use of applied fertilizer History of perennial rice research Interspecific hybridization and embryo culture, Thailand, early 1990s rhizome from the O. longistaminata parent of Dr. Tao's original hybridDrs Dayun Tao and Prapa Sripichitt, working at the Department of Agronomy, Kasetsart University, Bangkok, made numerous crosses between rice and wild, rhizomatous species. The difficulty of this work is illustrated by the case of the single successful hybrid they obtained between Oryza sativa and O. longistaminata. To get this one plant, 119 rice florets were pollinated, which produced 51 seeds. Of these seeds, 33 had culturable embryos, and only one of these embryos developed into a viable plant. Put another way, this hybridization was relatively easy: over 3000 pollinations had to be made between rice and O. rhizomatis to get a single viable plant. It was a fortunate cross in other respects: the hybrid was healthy and rhizomatous (it is still alive) and partially fertile, allowing F2 seed to be obtained. Perennial Upland Rice program, Philippines, 1990-2001 To address the problem of erosion in upland rice- growing regions, the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) initiated a breeding program for perennial upland rice in the mid-1990s. Within just a few years, the program achieved significant progress. The Perennial Upland Rice project team used populations derived from crossing the rice plant Oryza sativa with two different distantly related perennials in the hopes that at least one of these strategies would enable genes from the perennial to be moved to the cultivated rice gene pool. **O. rufipogon as donor of perenniality traits. Fertility of the progeny families was generally good, as might have been predicted, given that O. rufipogon is the ancestor of cultivated rice. Many families were perennial, and some of the highest yielding families were the most perennial, suggesting that breeding for both yield and perenniality is feasible.Sacks, E.J., J.P. Roxas, and M. T. Cruz (2003) Developing Perennial Upland Rice I: Field Performance of Oryza sativa/O. rufipogon F1, F4 and BC1F4 Progeny. Crop Science. 43:120-128. **O. longistaminataas donor of perenniality traits. This African species is genetically diverse, strongly perennial and rhizomatous. Rhizomes may be able to survive and spread in drier conditions than stolons. The downside of this donor is that it is more distantly related to cultivated rice and the crosses and backcrosses are much more difficult to make. Descendants of the few successful crosses are mostly infertile, and few were perennial. Many of the perennial plants lacked rhizomes. Rhizomes may not be essential for survival, but they may help plants survive stress and they certainly help them spread.Sacks, E.J., J.P. Roxas, and M. T. Cruz (2003) Developing Perennial Upland Rice II: Field Performance of S1 Families from an Oryza sativa/O. longistaminata Population. Crop Science. 43:129-134.Sacks, E. J. et al, 2006.

Mapping major rhizome genes, China, 1999-2001 Perennial rice research plot at a YAAS research station on Hainan IslandsHu Fengyi, now deputy director of the Food Crops Institute at YAAS, worked on the IRRI perennial-rice project and was senior author of the paper that first reported on mapping of genes for rhizome production in rice.F. Y. Hu* et al. (2003) Convergent evolution of perenniality in rice and sorghum. PNAS. 100 no. 7 4050-4054 Available from PNAS Using the F2 population derived from the Oryza sativa/O. longistaminata cross, two dominant-complementary genes, rhz2 and rhz3 controlling rhizomatousness were mapped. These were found to correspond with two QTLs associated with rhizomatousness in the genus Sorghum, suggesting that the evolution of the annual habit occurred independently, long after these species diverged. Efforts to map these genes in rice more finely are ongoing. Although other genes undoubtedly contribute to perenniality and rhizomatousness, these two are required in rice. Breeders use markers for these genes to assist in identifying potentially perennial individuals. Breeding population development, China, 2007-present The IRRI project was terminated in 2001 because of budget cuts, but the Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences (YAAS) in Kunming has continued the research. Rhizome were considered more stress tolerant than stolons, so they focused on populations derived from crosses with O. longistaminata. As Eric Sacks and colleagues found at IRRI, the plants in these populations mostly lack rhizomes and have a high level of sterility. Finding the extremely rare plants with both rhizomes and fertility has required screening large F2 and Backcross populations.Tao, D., F. Hu, Y. Yang, P. Xu. J. Li, E. Sacks, K. McNally, P.

Goals for perennial rice breeding Restore seed fertility Mapping genes that cause partial to complete sterility in many interspecific hybrids. As many as 35 such genes have been mapped in Oryza, and sterility is a big problem in the perennial rice program. Develop methods for quickly identifying rhizomatous plants *Marker assisted selection allows large numbers of plants to be screened for rhizome markers. In the field, plants are evaluated first for rhizome production, then for seed fertility, and finally for pollen viability through stainingPersonal communication with Mr. Fengyi Hu, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming, PRC *Fine mapping of rhizome genes will improve the efficiency of marker-aided-selection or even allow rhizome genes to be cloned and used in recombinant gene techniques. Eliminate undesirable genes from Oryza longistaminata Along with potentially useful genes for rhizomes, stress tolerance and disease resistance, undesirable genes from O. longistaminata are also still present in breeding populations. Back-crossing to high-yielding rice varieties is one way to reduce the frequency of these wild alleles. *Awns: wild Oryza species have awns, but farmers prefer awnless rice. *Small seed size: wild Oryza species have small seeds, but larger seeds are easier to thresh and clean. Larger seeds germinate more vigorously. Increasing seed size is one way to increase grain yield. *Altered grain quality: it will be difficult to achieve the flavor and cooking properties of traditional rice varieties. And there are thousands of local varieties with unique properties. Choosing from among the possible quality goals and then achieving them is a \\"formidable challenge\\"Wayne E. Marshall, James I.

It was entered into the 2003 Cannes Film Festival. Plot Livia, a young but mentally unaware woman, lives on an expansive state with a significant wealth. It is revealed through her somewhat childish behavior that she suffers from delusional visions, ones that she writes in her notebooks and shares with strangers. Her father and surrounding family members, seeing an opportunity to accumulate her inheritance, seek out a solution to have her die in order for others to receive the wealth she holds. They find a mental patient named Pointpoirot, whose sociopathic demeanor and violent tendencies lead to Harald choosing him for the job. Pointpoirot is released from the institution, given instructions to kill Livia. At Livia's estate, she encounters Pointpoirot as he wanders outside, finding herself oddly curious with his behavior (such as his mirrorless switchblade shaving). She allows him in, charmed by his politeness and seemingly innocent behavior, until he snaps and attempts to attack her. In retaliation, Livia knocks out Pointpoirot with a hammer, then accidentally killing one of her unsuspecting relatives with the same weapon. Following this, Livia finds herself wandering around the estate, seemingly oblivious to the crime she had committed. Pointpoirot, once awakened, finds himself intrigued by Livia's behavior, begins to aid her, murdering family members one by one as they appear at the estate. Forming an affectionate bond, Pointpoirot and Livia share time together, singing and playing piano as well as conversing. Meanwhile, the inspector and police officer assigned to the case appear to do nothing, instead allowing the conspiracy to unfold as it will. As family members progressively continue to die, it becomes clear that Livia is unaware of the fact that they are actually dead, going so far as to set up her relatives' bodies for supper. Livia and Pointpoirot continue to fall in love, whilst Harald continues to investigate the disappearances of the family. Upon realizing what is coming, Pointpoirot escapes, declaring his love for Livia as he makes his getaway. Harald arrives at her home, horrified by the carnage that had ensued. An investigator looking into the murderers discovers the motivations of the family to inherit the fortune. Harald, although tempted to end the madness by killing Livia, finds himself trapped, and with few options, commits suicide. As the film ends, we see schoolchildren walking in a line to class as military trucks drive by in a caravan. Over a disembodied radio, we hear a voice describing the massacre at the estate.

In a positive review, Dennis Schwartz of Ozus' World Movie Reviews states, \\"It never gets beyond the playful farce stage as the tale is filled with droll humor and absurd situations, but it remains entertaining as one of Ruiz's more accessible but minor works.\\" Filipe Furtado of Rouge adds further in a positive review: \\"Part of the fun in Ruiz's cinema is that he is a filmmaker who simultaneously feels a huge desire to exert control ‚Äì to guarantee the auteur's signature, one could say ‚Äì but at the same time he experiences an anarchic pleasure in letting the film escape from his hands. The joy of That Day comes from those moments of escape.\\" However, in a negative review, Jeffrey M. Anderson of Combustible Celluloid states, 'From France comes the latest by the prolific Raoul Ruiz, That Day, which follows the bizarre relationship between a loony bird-like young woman (Elsa Zylberstein) and a serial killer (Bernard Giraudeau). Set in Switzerland \\"in the near future\\", it's either too unhinged or not unhinged enough, I haven't decided yet.'\\" Further reading That Day is further explored in Michael Goddard's book, The Cinema of Ra√∫l Ruiz: Impossible Cartographies (2013, pp138‚Äì141).

Built in the late 18th century to replace an older inn also under the sign of the White Hart, it also served as Crawley's main post office for most of the 19th century, and still operates as a public house in the 21st century. Its partly timber-framed structure, which incorporates part of an early 17th-century building, is characteristic of the area. It is designated a Grade II Listed building. History Crawley developed slowly as a Wealden market town and ironmaking centre, focused on its north‚Äìsouth High Street, from the 13th century onwards. This street formed part of the main road from the capital city, London, to the increasingly fashionable seaside resort of Brighton. After the road was turnpiked in stages between the late 17th century and the mid-18th century, Crawley's position almost exactly halfway between the two allowed it to develop a prominent new role as a convenient stop for stagecoach passengers and drivers. By the late 18th century, it had become Sussex's main staging-post for journeys to and from London, as the neighbouring towns of Horsham and East Grinstead fell out of favour. The sale of the Ancient Priors, formerly known as the White Hart, allowed the new larger White Hart Inn to be built nearby. To fulfil this role, Crawley needed plenty of venues to entertain guests for a few hours or overnight, with rooms to accommodate overnight stops and facilities for changing teams of horses. Several medieval buildings on the High Street, such as the George Hotel, the Ancient Priors and the Old Punch Bowl, met this need to some extent, but none were built for that purpose: all had been adapted from existing structures with different uses. The Ancient Priors was built as a house with a small agricultural plot; the Old Punch Bowl had been a large farmhouse; and although the George had always been an inn, it expanded gradually and haphazardly across several neighbouring buildings. The Ancient Priors in particular was too small to meet the demand for its facilities. In 1753‚Äîat which point it was operating under the name The White Hart‚Äîit was sold, and soon afterwards became a farm. The proceeds were used to build a new White Hart Inn. A site further north on the High Street was selected; this was large enough to provide both a bigger building and a substantial area at the rear for the stabling of horses. Most sources agree that the new White Hart Inn opened in 1770, although some identify 1790 as the date. Architectural studies made in 1995 and 2003 attributed a date of around 1600 to the southern part of the building, suggesting that the inn was built around the core of an older structure. The inn was immediately successful at meeting the requirements of the greatly increased coaching traffic, which had grown from one daily service in 1756 to five by 1790 and 30 by 1815. Its facilities included accommodation for 180 horses. It was also one of Crawley's centres of commercial activity throughout the 19th century: the town's main post office was based there between 1810 (when a daily mail coach service between London and Brighton began) and 1895, and a corn exchange existed between 1800 and 1883. The post office was attached to the north side of the inn, and was demolished in the 1950s to make way for the Broadwalk‚Äîa pedestrian thoroughfare which formed an integral part of Crawley New Town's shopping centre. Crawley's oldest friendly society was founded in the White Hart in 1827, and it was also the venue for the events of the \\"Crawley Feast Day\\"‚Äîan annual celebratory gathering for the town's businesspeople, popular throughout the 19th century. In 1863, Mark Lemon, the founder of Punch magazine and a prominent Crawley resident, organised celebrations at the inn after the marriage of Edward, Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII) and Princess Alexandra. Stagecoach traffic declined in the late 19th century as trains, motor buses and cars successively became more popular, but some coaches continued to run until the 1940s. The White Hart Inn adapted and became a standard public house. As of 2009, it retains its original name, and is now in the ownership of Harveys Brewery (Harvey & Son (Lewes) Ltd.), a brewery based in Lewes in East Sussex. It is therefore a tied house. Harveys identify it as the busiest public house they own. The White Hart Inn was listed at Grade II on 23 February 1983. Architecture The 19th-century extension is in the foreground of this view from the northwest. The White Hart Inn is a timber-framed building consisting of three bays on a north‚Äìsouth orientation. The exterior is clad in stuccoed brickwork, the roof is tiled, and there are three brick chimneys. The southern section is the remnants of a timber-framed house dating from about 1600 (original estimates attributed an 18th-century date, in line with the actual opening of the inn). This had a stair turret at the rear leading into the attic, but only the topmost steps of this structure remain. The attic is still a separate space, now two rooms with one external window under the roof gable at the south end. Later, the building was extended to the rear. In about 1830, an extension was built to the north; this is of two storeys, like the earlier part, but is slightly taller and has a separate roofline. It is of brick and has no timber-framing. Similarly, no timber is now visible on the lower storey of the older section of the building.

The Georgia Chamber routinely supports good legislation and opposes bad legislation that most small and large business owners would consider a threat to their business success.  History  Founded in 1915 as the Georgia Manufacturing Association, the Georgia Chamber renamed itself the Associated Industries of Georgia in 1939. In 1968, the organization became the Georgia Business and Industry Association, and then in 1983 became the Business Council of Georgia. The most recent name change happened in 1992 and the organization has been known as the Georgia Chamber of Commerce ever since. Throughout the years, the Georgia Chamber of Commerce has cultivated relationships with several smaller statewide associations, entering into affiliate partnerships with six groups. These organizations include Leadership Georgia (1971), the Georgia Self-Insurers Association (1975) the Georgia Partnership for Excellence in Education (1990), the Georgia Employers' Association (2003), the Council on Alcohol and Drugs/Drugs Don't Work (2004), and the Tourism Development Alliance of Georgia (2004). The current President and CEO is Chris Clark, who has held the position since 2010. Today, the Georgia Chamber of Commerce employs approximately 30 people in the areas of operations, member services, government affairs, public policy, and communications. Hundreds of volunteers from businesses throughout the state are part of the organization's board of directors, government affairs council and policy committees.  State chamber vs. local chamber  The Georgia Chamber is unique in the sense that each of the organization's activities are designed for business advocacy purposes ‚Äì including direct lobbying efforts, membership events, the Georgia Business Action Network (GBAN), and others. Local chambers, on the other hand, tend to focus on economic development and tourism projects. The Georgia Chamber is not a competitor to the local chambers in the state ‚Äì rather, it is seen as a complement to networking and economic development programs offered at the local level.  Lobbying efforts  The Georgia Chamber of Commerce maintains an in-house team of lobbyists. This is to ensure business issues that matter the most to Georgia Chamber members are being watched, good legislation is being passed and bills considered detrimental to Georgia business are blocked. Recent legislative successes include: * Comprehensive Statewide Water Management Plan * Business tax incentives and prevention of expensive insurance mandates * Sales tax holidays, \\"Made in Georgia\\" marketing, water and energy efficient products * Civil justice reform and class action lawsuit reform * Provisions for expedited reviews of permits/variances * Tourism sales tax reimbursement  The Georgia Initiative  The Georgia Initiative is an effort launched in 2008 and designed to reposition the Georgia Chamber from a primarily reactive to a highly proactive organization. The objective of the Georgia Initiative is to make proactive participation and leadership possible by: increasing the capacity of the Georgia Chamber to identify key legislative initiatives that enable progressive change, to develop and shape policy positions that will drive that change, to more effectively lobby to support these positions, and to dramatically expand communications initiatives and infrastructure to support this proactive shift. Areas of public policy focus under the Georgia Initiative include: * Education and Workforce Development * Environment and Energy * Existing Business and Industry * Health Care * International * Law and Judiciary * Tax * Tourism * Transportation  The Red Carpet Tour and Georgia Quail Hunt  The Red Carpet Tour and Georgia Quail Hunt are events hosted in partnership by the Georgia Chamber of Commerce and the Georgia Allies. Both the Red Carpet Tour and the Georgia Quail Hunt are highly regarded economic development programs in the United States, and both events host business executives from around the world each year to learn about economic development opportunities offered by the state of Georgia. Past event participants who eventually moved company headquarters to Georgia include Georgia Pacific and NCR. The Red Carpet Tour is held each April and has been in existence since 1959. While participants visit Augusta each year to attend the Masters Golf Tournament, a second location differs from year-to-year to allow further exploration of the state. Locations have included Albany, Athens, Atlanta, Columbus, Dalton, Gainesville, Rome, Savannah and Valdosta. The Georgia Quail Hunt began in 1988 and is held each year in Southwest Georgia. Guests participate in quail hunting and shooting instruction on nine different Southern plantations while networking with Georgia business and legislative leaders.

In severe, excessive and irrational cases it may be a type of specific phobia. While lack of awareness by patient or doctor of adverse drug reactions can have serious consequences, having a phobia of medications can also have serious detrimental effects on patient health, for example refusal of necessary pharmacological interventions. Medication phobia can also lead to problems with medication compliance. Medication phobia can also present in parents who are concerned about giving medications to their children, fearing that the medications will do more harm than good. Medication phobia can be triggered by unpleasant adverse reactions to medications which are sometimes prescribed inappropriately or at excessive doses. Lack of awareness of the patient's predisposition to adverse effects (e.g. anxious patients and the elderly) and failure to attribute the adverse effects to the drug serves to compound the phobia. Starting at low doses and slowly increasing the medication dosage can avoid medication phobia secondary to adverse effects from developing. Fears of medication use is also prevalent in people who have experienced unpleasant withdrawal effects from psychotropic drugs. Sometimes patients wrongly associate symptoms of an acute disease or illness with medications used to treat the disease or illness. This form of pharmacophobia can be treated by attempting to convince the patient to take test doses of the drug or another drug in the same drug class to prove to the patient that the symptoms were not due to the drug but due to the illness the drug was taken to treat.

It was originally broadcast on ABC on November 1, 1984. While this movie is a fictional work, it is prefaced by a note accounting that a condition such as the main character's does exist, and that the film imagines the life of such a victim. Plot Ralph Macchio plays Billy Grier, the 15-year-old victim of a rare degenerative disease that speeds up the aging process. After Billy suddenly becomes ill, a series of tests are run, with the diagnosis tragic. A team of doctors tell Billy and his mother Nancy (Betty Buckley) that there is no cure for his condition and that he will die of old age related natural causes decades before his time. Shortly after this, Billy breaks down following a rage-filled rant where he destroys almost everything in his bedroom. With only a few months left to live, Billy hopes to realize three goals: He wants to drive a car, play his saxophone in a jazz band; and to make love to a woman for the first time. He also harbors a desire to see his long-estranged father one last time. Due to the sensitive nature of his parents' relationship and to protect her from his degenerative condition, Billy chooses not to tell Nancy about his wishes, setting out on his own to see his wishes fulfilled. Billy finds the key to two of his wishes when he meets Phyllis (Season Hubley), a sassy young woman with dreams of her own, one of which is to open a beauty salon. The two set out to work together and realize their dreams. Phyllis makes his first come true when they walk into a jazz club and she encourages him to play his saxophone. Billy plays well enough to awe the customers into stopping their conversations and listen to him play. As time passes, Billy realizes he cannot keep his secret from Phyllis any longer. He tells her one evening that he wishes to make love to her, a request she denies, though not entirely in opposition to the idea. Billy helps Phyllis realize her own dream when she applies for a loan to open her beauty salon, introducing him (by the name Bill) as her friend and associate, when questioned about her business acumen. Billy balks during a moment alone with Phyllis, stating that he knows nothing at all about business, and believes Phyllis to be using him. However, the bank officer, after seeing Billy's obvious signs of aging, is convinced that he's a credible partner with experience, which minimizes the risk of giving Phyllis the loan, which is then approved. Throughout all of this is a subplot involving Nancy, who discovers that her son is gone and believes he has left to go and die alone. She becomes depressed and despondent, totally cutting herself off from the outside world. When utility workers come to shut off her gas for non-payment, she flatly tells them to do what they have to do. A moment later, she comes to her senses and writes them a check to pay off her back balance. This begins the process of her getting on with her life and realizing that she may never see her son alive again. Phyllis helps Billy realize another dream, as she makes love to him for the very first time. The following morning, Billy gets up early to leave, wishing to spare Phyllis from his impending doom. A tearful Phyllis is already up waiting for him, not wanting him to be alone in his current condition. She relents after Billy explains to her that he intends to go back home and straighten things out with his mother. On his way back, Billy stops at a diner, where he suddenly falls ill and ducks behind the building to throw up. The diner's fry cook assists him...it's his father, who has been living a hand-to-mouth existence and suffers from alcoholism. Billy's father does not recognize his son nor does Billy disclose his relationship to the man. Billy returns home and passes Nancy on an airport escalator, however she fails to recognize him. However, her eye catches a glimpse of her son, now in his advanced stages of aging. After a moment she recognizes her son and rushes into his arms. The movie ends with Nancy and Billy at a camping village, making the most of their last remaining days together.

ReboundTAG is known to have worked with IATA, Alien Technology and Lufthansa in developing the microchip luggage tags and now supplies them globally to companies including Lufthansa, Etihad, Oracle, Facebook, Sony, Hyatt, Intercontinental and Marriott. Development of the RFID Tags Due to weaknesses in the antenna and CPU of RFID chips there has been a demand for an encapsulated luggage tag for several years, but most of the resins experimented with interfered with the reading of the microchip. A permanent RFID luggage tag means that the microchip is protected and can also be used for automatic check-in of items of luggage, saving resources.http://www.rfid- weblog.com/50226711/rfid_for_airline_baggage_tracking.php Summary of RFID for Luggage The tags contain two microchips; an ultra high frequency RFID chip that is used for identification and for encoding flight details when the person travels and an NFC chip that can be used by the airport or airline to get the lost bag details immediately on their smartphone as well as alert the owner of the bag by SMS and email. There is also a QR code and number printed on the tag so that they work in airports that do not use microchip systems. The system is integrated with Worldtracer so that when a bag is found the ReboundTAG ID can be entered into the Worldtracer database and an automatic alert is triggered so that the owner of the bag can be updated with respect to the situation with their bag. The ReboundTAG concept was showcased by Lufthansa at the IATA Annual General Meeting in Berlin as a potential way to prevent lost luggage globally and is still the only luggage tag ever showcased by an airline at the IATA AGM. At the event Lufthansa gave out ReboundTAG RFID tags to all of the delegates that attended and following this the ReboundTAG concept was featured on BBC World News among other news outlets.

Simon is also seen in present- day New York (and in the second series, present day Reading) using short prologues and epilogues in the show. Alongside Simon, are his mother, Debbie, his father, Andy, his older sister Ashlene and his best friend, Kyle \\"Kylie\\" Parkinson. Simon Doonan Simon Doonan (Luke Ward-Wilkinson/Samuel Barnett) is the main character and narrator of Beautiful People. He is based on the Barneys window dresser Simon Doonan, who grew up in the 1960s, however, the character grows up in the 1990s. Like his real namesake, Simon is half English and Irish. In 1997, Simon lived in Reading with his parents, sister, and his mother's best friend, Hayley. However, in the present day he lives in New York City with his boyfriend Sacha, and later returns to Reading when he splits up with Sacha. Simon is known by his camp, effeminate behaviour. His best friend is Kyle \\"Kylie\\" Parkinson, an equally camp boy who lives across the road in Reading. They are close friends and have only once fallen out, when Simon dyed Kylie's hair wrong, causing him to look like a blond \\"Ronald McDonald\\". In 1997 Simon had curtained hair, a haircut very popular in the 1990s. Simon became an accomplished football player after he discovered his idol, Victoria Beckham (then known as Victoria \\"Posh Spice\\" Adams), was to marry David Beckham. Simon has a lightning bolt-shaped scar on his forehead, similar to Harry Potter, however he always conceals it with makeup. Simon was a big fan of Steps when he was younger. Simon and Kylie ran away from home to London, but his parents realised and called the police after seeing him on Live & Kicking. Simon, who hoped to be on the stage, wanted to be educated at Madame Darcy's School of Theatre, but his parents refused. After qualifying at school Simon became a set dresser on Live With Loretta (a parody of GMTV with Lorraine). He then becomes a window dresser at Barneys in New York. In the second series, Simon and Sacha have split up and Simon returns to the family home in Reading; he soon finds a new job at Selfridges in London. He comes out to his mother (through a letter, read in voice-over while he and his crush Mickey dance on the roof and almost kiss) in the last episode of season 2, after she tells him that she loves him no matter what and that other boys are crap (after he says that he isn't \\"like other boys\\"). Simon becomes engaged to Mickey in the last episode of season 2 (in the 2009 epilogue). In the end, Simon states that even though he spent his life wishing he was with the beautiful people, he now knows they were with him all along, quoting Judy Garland 'There really is no place like home'. Debbie Doonan Debbie Doonan attending the funeral of Tameka Debbie Doonan (Olivia Colman) is Simon's mother, who lives with him, Andy, Ashlene and best friend Hayley at 19 Melody Crescent. Debbie Doonan is described by Simon as \\"the most glamorous woman in Reading\\", however, her glamorous reputation is temporarily tarnished when her hairdresser, Tameka, dies half way through her haircut. She has peroxide blonde bleached hair and hair extensions. Debbie is a cigarette smoker and a heavy drinker, and won a year's free supply of gin in a poetry competition. Supposedly, Debbie and Andy drank so heavily when they married that they cannot remember the date (either June 14 or May 8), but it is eventually revealed that this is actually because they had both been lying, and had not in fact got married at all. Debbie quits drinking for a week to prove to Simon that she is not \\"Reading's answer to Oliver Reed\\", however Debbie eventually succumbs to Andy's homemade gherkin and cucumber wine after being called a \\"moody bitch\\" when sober. Debbie is outspoken and very opinionated, but always loving to her children. A barmaid at the local pub, Debbie attacks Simon's teacher, after discovering she allowed him to drink with her in the pub. She also charges people to read their tea leaves, despite her possessing no psychic ability. Debbie is an excellent fighter and has various brawls with Reba (Kylie's mother) and pushes an American woman through a plate glass window for \\"suspiciously\\" touching her bum bag. She also gets arrested for assault after punching Tristram Bell, the school drama teacher, but he decides not to press charges. Her previous criminal record involved her throwing a Cadbury's Creme Egg at Margaret Thatcher, but she missed and hit a police officer, causing his eye to swell up the size of a golf ball according to the judge. She speaks fluent Polish, after taking in two Polish lodgers in 2009. Andy Doonan Andrew \\"Andy\\" Doonan (Aidan McArdle) is Simon's father who lives in Melody Crescent with his family. Andy is a self-employed plumber. Reba often attempts to engage in an affair with Andy, however he always refuses, and would never cheat on Debbie. Reba later accuses him of being a flasher after the zip on Andy's jeans becomes broken. His mother, Gwen Doonan, was a devout Catholic. He often distills his own alcohol and has made potato wine, parsnip wine and marmalade wine. He suffers nightmares involving Cabbage Patch Dolls. Andy, under instructions from Debbie, attempts to teach Simon football until he kicks the ball into his face. Ashlene Doonan Ashlene Doonan (Sophie Ash) is the older sister of Simon Doonan. She has a reputation as a promiscuous girl, and has dated every man in her street except 'Backward Frank'. She blackmails Simon by taking a picture of him in a stolen dress owned by Reba and threatens to show the picture to everybody unless he styles her hair \\"like Heather Small from M People\\". When growing up she aspired to either move to Paris and sell her body or work at Woolworths. Ashlene was the victim of a flasher, who flashed at her outside Nando's, she was upset when the flasher did not want her phone number. The second series includes an ongoing storyline concerning Ashlene's unplanned pregnancy, which concludes with her giving birth to a boy 'Puff Daddy Doonan', fathered by Jayeson Jackson (a school bully in Simon's year). Aunty Hayley Hayley de Souza (Meera Syal), better known simply as Aunty Hayley, is a lodger who stays with the Doonans. She is best friends with Debbie Doonan, and first met her when Debbie was working in the pub. Hayley was born in Bushey, Hertfordshire, but moves in with the Doonans so Debbie can wean her off her amphetamine addiction. Hayley is blind, and she describes Helen Keller as her role model. While Hayley claims to be \\"blind\\" she insinuates that she can actually \\"see\\". She participated in the Greenham Common Women's Peace Camp and frequently recalls her time there. She buys Simon a nylon tracksuit, which he loathes. Simon seeks revenge, after he is made to wear a nylon tracksuit, and blackmails her for ¬£30 after discovering her eating burgers, after she had stated that she would only eat \\"nuts and berries\\". Hayley briefly dates Billy Bingo until she discovers he is the mysterious flasher who exposed himself to Ashlene. She, like Debbie, is a cigarette smoker. After Hayley and Debbie have an argument Hayley moves out and lives with her friend Sheila-Galesha, but moves back after finding her annoying. Mummy Mummy is Hayley's overweight guide dog, who herself has poor eyesight. After a visit to the vet, Hayley discovers that if Mummy doesn't participate in an 'apples only' diet to lose weight she will die. Her favourite food becomes Golden Delicious apples. She weighs 110 lbs. At Tameka's funeral Mummy dives upon the coffin, dragging Hayley in too, after apples (Tameka's favourite too) are dropped into the grave. Mummy's boyfriend Fido dies \\"doing a number two\\", leading Debbie to believe she possesses psychic powers, due to Simon tricking her. Kylie Parkinson Kyle \\"Kylie\\" Parkinson (Layton Williams) is Simon Doonan's best friend, who lives across the road with his single mother, Reba Parkinson. He is nicknamed Kylie after his idol, Kylie Minogue. Kylie's father, Matt, bullies him and assaults his mother, causing Kylie to push him out of a window, impaling him on a miniature Eiffel Tower in Reba's garden. Reba claims that he is related to Paul Robeson, however this is most probably untrue. As well as idolising Kylie Minogue, he loves Princess Diana, and was so distraught when he heard of her death that he had to be sedated with Night Nurse (medicine). In an attempt to look more like Princess Diana, Kylie gets Simon to dye his hair blonde, which turns out disastrously wrong and causing them to fall out, until they become friends again after the death of Diana. The two are best friends, and after Simon's nose is nearly broken by Imelda, Kylie pours red dye over her, similar to on Carrie. Reba Parkinson Reba sporting a dress similar to the iconic 'Union Jack dress' worn by Geri Halliwell at the 1997 Brit Awards Reba Parkinson (Sarah Niles) is the mother of Kylie Parkinson. She is the daughter of Roy and Enid. Reba speaks with a mancunian accent, as she previously lived in Manchester with her son and her then-husband, Matt. However, Reba and Kylie are relocated to Reading by a women's charity after she becomes the victim of domestic abuse, subsequently resulting in Matt's imprisonment. Reba becomes a single parent, raising her child whilst taking a job as a checkout worker in Poundland. She occasionally attempts to engage in extramarital relations with Andy, however she is constantly rebuffed. As a result, she is constantly branded a \\"slut\\" by Debbie, who regularly implies that Reba has a \\"reputation\\". Matt accuses Reba of once being a prostitute, to which she strongly denies. She frequently calls Kylie a \\"batty boy\\" and is keen for him to find a girlfriend, despite defending his mannerisms when Matt returns. After Kylie accidentally kills Matt Reba lies to the police in order to protect Kylie, saying he jumped from the window on a suicide mission, as she does not want her son to be punished for killing the man who abused the both of them. She usually wears various gold jewellery, including her trademark 'R' necklace, and has a Grace Jones- style haircut. Tameka Tameka (Tameka Empson) is a hairdresser in Reading, who owns her owned her own shop, Reservoir Bobs (a pun of Reservoir Dogs) until her death in 1997. Tameka is good friends with Debbie, and shares her love of alcohol. She has relatives living in Jamaica. Her most coveted possession is her golden hair tongs, which she won at a hair styling competition, freestyle section. The tongs are later stolen by Kylie whilst Tameka is lying in repose. Tameka's other favourite items include Brazil nuts, water melons, apples and rum. Tameka claimed to be secretly married to George Michael before he came out. She also claimed to be in the final three for the role of the Shake 'n' Vac woman. Tameka loves to sing, with her answering machine message involving her singing the chorus of \\"Waterloo\\" by ABBA. However, she despises pop acts such as Steps. Tameka dies in 1997 of a heart attack whilst cutting Debbie's hair, causing her to have a hacked, half-cut haircut. Johoyo After Tameka's death, her even more eccentric 'identical cousin' Johoyo (also played by Tameka Empson) takes over the salon, renaming it Johoyo's Hair a Go-Go. Both Debbie and Hayley continue to use the salon even though Johoyo displays no hairdressing skill or knowledge whatsoever, to the extent of not even knowing the word \\"scissors\\", calling them \\"Cutty Cutty Boom Boom's\\". Miss Perrin Miss Perrin (Michelle Butterly) is the headteacher at Simon's school in Reading. She was once a television star and appeared as a Hill's Angel on The Benny Hill Show, however she changed her career and became headteacher. Miss Perrin has ginger hair and claims she's often mistaken for Ginger Spice. She originates from Liverpool and speaks with a thick Liverpudlian accent, causing Aunty Hayley to mistake her for Cilla Black. A picture of her with Benny Hill shows her first name to be Cheryl. She excludes Simon for two days after both falsely believing he stole her clutch bag and caused a fight with school bully, Jayeson Jackson. She often wears powder pink colours and pearls, resulting in Simon describing her as \\"the most glamorous person\\" he knows. She is known to have attended university, as she mentions that she has letters after her name. Mickey McCann Mickey McCann (Benny Gur) is a boy who arrives at Simon's school in the last episode of series 2 ('How I Got My Gash'), who initially seems to be friendly towards Simon and Kylie, but later joins up with Jayeson Jackson's gang and bullies them. Simon is attracted to him from the moment he sees him, and remains so throughout the bullying. When Simon decides to run away at the end of the episode, he meets Mickey at the bus stop and Mickey offers him a lift home on his bike (because there was a bus strike on). They sit on Simon's roof near the end of the episode, talking about why Mickey had to leave his old school (someone found a letter he wrote to Jason Orange saying how he felt about him). The two then sing and dance on the roof and almost kiss, however the ambulance for Ashlene turns up and causes Simon to fall off the roof in shock, saying: \\"Oh my God, I'll go to Reading Jail\\", (a reference to Oscar Wilde's imprisonment for homosexuality). In 2009, Simon announces to his shocked mother that he is getting married, he hastily clarifies that it is to Mickey from school (who he has been Skyping with since he returned from New York). Jayeson Jackson Jayeson Jackson (Josh Handley) is student at Simon's school who frequently bullies Simon and Kylie because of their effeminate qualities. He is only once nice to Simon in one episode in series one ('How I Got My Posh'), where he gives Simon a Posh Spice doll after Simon wins a football match and rejects the trophy as being too garish. Jayeson plays a large part in the series two final ('How I got My Gash') where his bullying of Simon and Kylie intensifies, and he is revealed to be the father of Ashlene's baby.

They describe the relationship between a person's cognitive model of the information sought and the organization of this information in an information system. These models attempt to understand how a person is searching for information so that the database and the search of this database can be designed in such a way as to best serve the user. Information retrieval may incorporate multiple tasks and cognitive problems, particularly because different people may have different methods for attempting to find this information and expect the information to be in different forms. Cognitive models of information retrieval may be attempts at something as apparently prosaic as improving search results or may be something more complex, such as attempting to create a database which can be queried with natural language search. Berrypicking One way of understanding how users search for information has been described by Marcia BatesMarcia Bates (1989). \\"The Design of Browsing and Berrypicking Techniques for the Online Search Interface.\\" https://pages.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/bates/berrypicking.html at the University of California at Los Angeles. Bates argues that \\"berrypicking\\" better reflects how users search for information than previous models of information retrieval. This may be because previous models were strictly linear and did not incorporate cognitive questions. For instance, one typical model is of a simple linear match between a query and a document. However, Bates points out that there are simple modifications that can be made to this process. For instance, Salton has argued that user feedback may help improve the search results.Gerard Salton (1968). Automatic Information and Retrieval (Computer Science). Dubuque, Iowa: Mcgraw-Hill Inc. Bates argues that searches are evolving and occur bit by bit. That is to say, a person constantly changes his or her search terms in response to the results returned from the information retrieval system. Thus, a simple linear model does not capture the nature of information retrieval because the very act of searching causes feedback which causes the user to modify his or her cognitive model of the information being searched for. In addition, information retrieval can be bit by bit. Bates gives a number of examples. For instance, a user may look through footnotes and follow these sources. Or, a user may scan through recent journal articles on the topic. In each case, the user's question may change and thus the search evolves. Exploratory Search Researchers in the areas of human-computer interaction and cognitive science focus on how people explore for information when interacting with the WWW. This kind of search, sometimes called exploratory search, focuses on how people iteratively refine their search activities and update their internal representations of the search problems.Qu, Yan & Furnas, George. \\"Model-driven formative evaluation of exploratory search: A study under a sensemaking framework\\" Existing search engines were designed based on traditional library science theories related to retrieval of basic facts and simple information through an interface. However, exploratory information retrieval often involves ill-defined search goals and evolving criteria for evaluation of relevance. The interactions between humans and the information system will therefore involve more cognitive activity, and systems that support exploratory search will therefore need to take into account the cognitive complexities involved during the dynamic information retrieval process. Natural language searching Another way in which cognitive models of information may help in information retrieval is with natural language searching. For instance, How Stuff Works imagines a world in which, rather than searching for local movies, reading the reviews, then searching for local Mexican restaurants, and reading their reviews, you will simply type \\"\\"I want to see a funny movie and then eat at a good Mexican restaurant. What are my options?\\" into your browser, and you will receive a useful and relevant response.Strickland, J. (n.d.). HowStuffWorks \\"How Web 3.0 Will Work\\". Howstuffworks \\"Computer\\". Retrieved November 4, 2009, from http://computer.howstuffworks.com/web-30.htm Although such a thing is not possible today, it represents a holy grail for researchers into cognitive models of information retrieval. The goal is to somehow program information retrieval programs to respond to natural language searches. This would require a fuller understanding of how people structure queries.

Gould captained his club side, Newport RFC, for a single season, and is best known as the younger brother of Welsh rugby superstar Arthur \\"Monkey\\" Gould Sporting career Rugby Gould came from a notable sporting family from Newport in South Wales, his father, Joseph Gould, was a keen sportsman and played cricket for the local team. Five of Wyatt's brothers played rugby for Newport, one of the most prolific clubs in the country. Of the six brothers, three were capped at an international level, all for Wales; they were Bob, Bert and most famously Arthur \\"Monkey\\" Gould. Arthur and Bob both captained Wales and like Wyatt also captained Newport, though Wyatt never reached the level of international rugby achieved by his brothers. Gould joined Newport in 1899 and played most of his career at wing, playing opposite to Wales wing players Teddy MorganBlackheath vs Newport 1901 blackandambers.co.uk and Johnnie Williams.Swansea vs Newport 1901 blackandambers.co.uk In the 1905/06 season Gould was selected to captain the senior Newport team, but he only played five games during the period, with Charlie Pritchard taking over the captaincy duties while Gould was absent.Wyatt Gould Newport club profile blackandambers.co.uk Gould left Newport in 1907, but continued his association with Newport as a club official for many years. Athletics As well as rugby, Gould was a keen athlete, and his specialised in the 120 yard hurdles. He came third in the Amateur Athletic Association 120 hurdles of 1903 and was Welsh 120 yard hurdles champion of 1902, 1903, 1905 and 1910. In 1908, Gould switched to the 440 yard hurdles in an attempt to win a place at the 1908 Summer Olympics.

General information From 1905 the steamship has transported goods, post, people and lumber. Since there are still no road connection to some houses, the boat is still important for many inhabitants. While the main income in the past was the freight of lumber and heavy cargoes the boat today is mainly used as a ferry, to transport the many tourists seeking the national parks to go hiking. History For the last 17 years, the steamship has sailed its way through Femunden with its dark coloured hull. But, in 2009 the boat company and owner of the steamship decided to paint the whole boat white. Today, the steamship is in its original colour. In 1958 the old steam engine was replaced with a diesel engine. Facilities The boat holds 100 passengers and has service on board. The boat operates between 15 June and mid-September.

In 1971 Melvin B. G. Meyer acquired majority interest in the firm, which adopted its name in reference to its founder and its two principal architects, Meyer and John M. Gibson. The architectural firm is among the oldest still operating in the United States. More than twenty of its projects are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History Diedrich A. Bohlen, a native of Cadenberge, Kingdom of Hanover, immigrated to the United States around 1851, and founded D. A. Bohlen, Architect, on April 10, 1853 at Indianapolis, Indiana. Bohlen is credited for introducing the German Neo-Gothic style to Indiana.Richard Smith, \\"Bohlen, Meyer, Gibson and Associates\\", in The designs for several of his buildings, including the Indianapolis City Market fa√ßade (1886), exhibit the Romanesque Revival architecture style called Rundbogenstil. More than twenty of the Bohlen firm's projects are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, including Morris-Butler House (1864), Indianapolis; Foley Hall (1860, 1897), Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College; Saint John the Evangelist Catholic Church (1871), rectory (1863) and bishop's residence (1878), Indianapolis; Roberts Park Methodist Church (1876), Indianapolis; Crown Hill Cemetery's Gothic Chapel (1877); Indianapolis City Market (1886); Indianapolis's Majestic Building (1896); and the Indianapolis Fire Department headquarters (1913) and municipal garage (1913), among others. Bohlen's firm is among the oldest architectural firms still operating in the United States. Four successive generation of Bohlen architects have worked at the Indianapolis firm. Diedrich Augustus Bohlen founded the firm in 1853. Oscar Diedrich Bohlen, D. A.'s son, joined the firm around 1882, and became a partner in 1884. August Carl Bohlen, Oscar's son, joined the firm in 1910, and later co-authored Indiana's original building codes. Robert Lesh Bohlen, August's son, joined the firm in 1946. D. A. Bohlen, Architect, went through several name and ownership changes after Bohlen's descendants, new partners, and associates joined the firm. In 1876 Matthew Roth became D. A. Bohlen's business partner, and for a few years the firm was named Bohlen and Roth. In 1884, after Bohlen's son, Oscar, joined the firm, its name was changed to D. A. Bohlen and Son, Architects. Following D. A. Bohlen's death on June 1, 1890, Oscar continued the family firm on his own until 1910, except for the period between 1897 and 1899, when Hugo Zigrosser was his partner. After Oscar's death in 1936, his son, August, who joined the firm in 1910, and August's son, Robert, continued the family's presence at the architectural firm until the mid-twentieth century. Following Robert's death in 1960, August Bohlen entered into a partnership with David V. Burns. The firm was renamed Bohlen and Burns Architects in 1961, and incorporated as Bohlen, Burns and Associates in 1967. With August's retirement in 1970, ownership passed from the Bohlen family to Melvin B.G. Meyer and John M. Gibson, the firm's main architects, and Noel Cord, the firm's accountant. Meyer, who joined firm in 1946 as a draftsman, served as its main designer from 1948 to 1990. In 1971 Meyer acquired majority interest in the firm, which adopted the name, Bohlen, Meyer, Gibson and Associates, Inc. in reference to its founder, D. A. Bohlen, and its two principal architects, Meyer and Gibson. Mike Rogers and Hans Megerling, also architects in the firm, replaced Cord as investors in the firm in 1980. Following Meyer's retirement from the firm in 1990, Mr. and Mrs. John V. Schneider of the Schneider Corporation purchased the architectural firm. Although the firm's original location in Indianapolis is not known, its offices were housed in several downtown locations, before moving to more suburban locations, including the Meadows Office Complex (1970‚Äì78), Castleton, (1978‚Äì91), and North Post Road, (1991‚Äì ). Major clients and projects The firm specialized in institutional structures for religious, educational, and civic institutions, although it did design some private residences for well-do-to families, such as the French mansard-style Morris-Butler House (1864) in Indianapolis and the Neo-Jacobean-style Churchman House (1871) on a farm that later became part of Beech Grove, Indiana.\\"Biographical Sketches\\" in The firm did not enter the multi-family housing market until 1993. Most of the Bohlen firm's early projects were in the Indianapolis area. Notable exceptions include the French Lick Springs Hotel (1898), designed by Oscar Bohlen, in French Lick, Indiana, and numerous buildings for the Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods at Saint Mary-of-the-Woods, Indiana.Probst and Reichmann, p. 106. The firm's architects also designed Oldenburg Convent (1899), Oldenburg Academy (1898), and other buildings for the Sisters of Saint Francis at Oldenburg, Indiana, as well as buildings at The Carmel of Saint Joseph, a Carmelite monastery in Allendale, Indiana. In 1891 Bohlen's firm submitted a design for a proposed Indiana building to be erected at the World's Columbian Exposition (1893) at Chicago. The selection committee narrowed its choice to two plans, one from the Bohlen firm and the other from Wing and Mahurin of Fort Wayne, Indiana. In a controversial move from the committee's leadership, a design proposed by Chicago architect Henry Ives Cobb was recommended to the Indiana Board of World's Fair Managers and built for the exposition, despite protests from the Indiana architects who argued that Cobb's plan arrived after the contest deadline. Although the Bohlen firm did not receive this prestigious commission, it designed other projects built outside of Indiana at Cleveland, Ohio; Dayton, Ohio; Detroit, Michigan; Grand Rapids, Michigan; and Saint Louis, Missouri. Sisters of Providence projects One of the firm's earliest and long-standing clients was the Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods. D. A. Bohlen established a relationship with the Sisters of Providence in the 1850s that continued over several decades. Boheln's firm completed \\"more than sixty projects\\" for the Sisters. Providence motherhouse and chapel (1853‚Äì4, 1863), Foley Hall (1860), and the Church of the Immaculate Conception (1892) are among Diedrich Bohlen's early renovations and designs for the Sisters of Providence on the grounds of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College, a Roman Catholic liberal arts college near Terre Haute, Indiana. A fire destroyed the motherhouse in 1889, and Foley Hall has been demolished, but the Church of the Immaculate Conception is still in use.Logan, pp. 326‚Äì28, and Construction on the Church of the Immaculate Conception began in 1886. After D. A. Bohlen's death in 1890, Oscar continued his father's legacy as community architect at Saint Mary-of-the-Woods. The church's interior decoration was completed in 1907, and it underwent a major renovation in 1987, with Melvin Meyer as the project architect.Madden, p. 183; A Journey of Love, Mercy, and Justice, p. 24; and The Bohlen firm designed several additional buildings for Sisters of Providence, including an addition to Foley Hall (1897), a new novitiate (1904), Guerin Hall (1913), Saint Cecilia Conservatory of Music (1913), Le Fer Hall (1924), and Blessed Sacrament Chapel (1924).Madden, pp. 135‚Äì37, 382‚Äì84, 396, and 519‚Äì20. Robert Bohlen, the last of D. A. Bohlen's descendants to design a building for the Sisters of Providence, designed Owens Hall (1960).Madden, p. 573. The firm's president, Melvin B. G. Meyer, designed a new library and chapel in the Providence motherhouse and Providence Center. Indianapolis projects Many of the firm's most notable religious, civic, commercial, and residential buildings were erected in Indianapolis. These include buildings designed by the firm's founder, D. A. Bohlen, his descendants, and Melvin B. G. Meyer. Bohlen's early commissions in the city included the Charles Mayer store fa√ßade (1853), the dome for Odd Fellows Grand Lodge (1854), and the Metropolitan (1858), the city's first theater.Costigan designed the Odd Fellows Grand Lodge, but D. A. Bohlen completed it after Costigan's death. See Indianapolis's German community was another source of early commissions for the firm. D. A. Bohlen was the architect for the city's German-English Independent School (1860) on Maryland Street and the General German Protestant Orphans' Home (1872), later known as Pleasant Run Children's Home, on South State Avenue.Probst and Reichmann, pp. 36‚Äì37.Walton, p. 44. The firm designed several of Indianapolis's notable churches and cemetery structures. D. A. Bohlen designed the United Evangelical Zion Church (1866) on West Ohio Street; his firm also designed its replacement, Zion United Church of Christ (1913), at North and New Jersey Streets.Probst and Reichmann, p. 10, and D. A. Bohlen designed Crown Hill Cemetery's Gothic Chapel (1875), and his firm designed an addition to the structure in 1917. Crown Hill's Community Mausoleum, designed by the Bohlen firm, was completed in the early 1950s. In 1960 the firm drew up plans for the cemetery's first garden crypts.Wissing, Tobias, Dolan, and Ryder, pp. 17, 42, 47, 124, 182, 188, and 286. D. A. Bohlen also designed Saint John the Evangelist Catholic Church (1871), the main structure in a cluster of parish buildings on the southwest corner of Georgia Street and Capitol Avenue in Indianapolis that includes a D. A. Bohlen-designed rectory (1863) and bishop's residence (1878). D. A. Bohlen's son, Oscar, designed the twin spires on the two towers that flank the church's main fa√ßade and supervised their construction in 1893. Other D. A. Bohlen-designed buildings for the parish include Saint Johns School for Boys (1867), across the alley from the rectory, and the Saint Johns Academy for Girls (1874), on nearby Maryland Street. Both of these buildings were later demolished. Other notable churches designed by D. A. Bohlen include the Romanesque Revival-style Roberts Park Methodist Church (1876) at Delaware and Vermont Streets; Emmanuel Church (1883), later renamed Lockerbie Square United Methodist Church, at East and New York Streets; and Saint Paul's Evangelical Lutheran Church (1883) at McCarty and New Jersey Streets. Oscar Bohlen designed Assumption Catholic Church (1894). Built in West Indianapolis, a city suburb at that time, it is the oldest frame Catholic church in the city in continuous use. Also known as Saint Mary of the Assumption Roman Catholic Church, it was later named Saint Athanasius the Great Byzantine-Ruthenian Catholic Church. Oscar also designed the parish's original school building (1895).Divita, pp. 5, 23, and 32. Numerous commercial and several notable civic structures were designed in Indianapolis during Oscar Bohlen's tenure at the firm. D. A. and Oscar Bohlen collaborated on the Indianapolis City Market (1886), still in operation, and Tomlinson Hall (1886), adjacent to the City Market at the corner of Delaware and Market Streets. Tomlinson Hall was destroyed by fire in 1958. Oscar Bohlen's most notable commercial structure was the Majestic Building (1896), a commission from the Indiana Gas Company, at 47 South Pennsylvania Street. The ten-story, steel-skeleton building became the city's first skyscraper. Oscar also designed the Indiana National Bank building (1897), a Neoclassical structure at Three Virginia Avenue. Demolished in 1971, it was among the first fireproof building in Indiana. Oscar's son, August, designed a six-floor addition to the bank's adjacent building. August Bohlen designed the Stokely Brothers office building (1912) and the Indianapolis Star-News building (1924); however, August and Robert Bohlen's most notable design was the Art Deco-style Empire Life and Accident Insurance Company building (1950). It later became known as the Lilly Endowment building. The firm's other major projects in Indianapolis during the early twentieth century included the Oscar Bohlen-designed Murat Temple (1910) at Massachusetts Avenue and New Jersey and Michigan Streets. He also designed an addition to Indianapolis Union Station (1903) and the Pennway (1909) and Big Four (1929) buildings. The Bohlen firm designed several buildings for Indianapolis's Saint Vincent Hospital, Methodist Hospital, and Saint Francis Hospital, among others. In 1882 D. A. Bohlen remodeled a vacant seminary building on East Vermont Street for the Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul to house Saint Vincent's Infirmary, predecessor to Indianapolis's Saint Vincent Hospital. Oscar Bohlen designed the hospital's second building (1889) on South and Delaware Streets, and after it was destroyed by fire in 1904, the Bohlen firm designed the third Saint Vincent Hospital (1913) building facing Fall Creek Parkway, between Capitol and Illinois Streets.Probst and Reichmann, p. 37 and 106. Oscar also designed Methodist Hospital (1901) and Saint Francis Hospital (1903). During the 1970s and 1980s the firm's Indianapolis clients included Indianapolis Newspapers, Inc.; Saint Vincent Hospital; Methodist Hospital; and the Indiana National Bank, in addition to the Indianapolis Fire Department, the Beveridge Paper Company, the University of Indianapolis (formerly Indiana Central University), and the Diamond Chain Company, among others. Melvin Meyer designed the executive offices for Indianapolis Newspapers, Inc.; the Krannert Pavilion and the Children's Pavilion at Methodist Hospital; the Krannert Library at the University of Indianapolis; and the Kiwanis International headquarters at Indianapolis.

Synopsis In this book Aragon's intellectual work is reflected through the description of Arabic and Muslim culture in both poetry and prose. Aragon describes the relationships between the Muslim and Catholic world at the time of Inquisition in Spain by using the fall of Granada and the escape of Boabdil in front of Isabella the Catholic as a background. As most of the books of Aragon, Le Fou d'Elsa is a book about love. Aragon announces a new woman to come, a woman called Elsa, in the quote \\"Woman is the future of man\\". But Le Fou d'Elsa is not only about love. The book is also a description of the beginnings of the depression of the Muslim world, first with the fall of Granada until the colonization. Le Fou d'Elsa represents a political opinion as the book was written at the time of decolonization in France.

Engineer diploma he acquired in 1877, and at the same time he gained a position of professor's assistant in Department of Geodetics Engineering. Shortly he entered Lviv University, where he studied the mathematics and physics. Owing to very good results of his education, he acquired a scholarship in Berlin. He continued there studies under Gustav Kirchhoff direction (two years period). Next he moved to Great Britain for one-year studies under William Thomson-Lord Kelvin direction. After his return (1881) to Lviv he was shortly qualified as an assistant professor (1882) and at the age of 33 he acquired a degree of associate professor (1887). Next year he was invited by the Jagiellonian University and moved to Krak√≥w. He was appointed professor and chairman of Department of Physics of the Jagiellonian University. In 1889 he became associate member and in 1893 a fellow of Akademia Umiejƒôtno≈õci in Krak√≥w.

B. Bates Memorial Library Asbury Grove, located in Hamilton, Massachusetts, was formed during the camp meeting religious movement popular in the mid-19th century. Originally set on seventy-five acres of land, the camp was founded by the Methodist church in 1857. Ten of the original seventy-five acres were purchased from Joseph Dodge, a local farmer. This land included a farmhouse, which later became the Superintendent's Cottage.Weiss, 1998 The camp grounds were used in the summer months by Methodist congregations from towns along the North Shore of Massachusetts (such as Lynn, Groveland, and Reading). The camp was named after Bishop Francis Asbury, a prominent member of the Methodist camp meeting circuit in the early 19th century. The camp was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Asbury Grove Historic District in 2009. Historical context Camp meetings can be traced the back to Kentucky's \\"Great Revival\\" in 1800. The movement spread to the southern United States and other parts of the country thereafter. Meetings typically lasted several days and included intensive services, prayer, and bible study. Although Asbury Grove is a Methodist community, other religious groups such as the Presbyterians and Baptists also joined this movement.Forney, 1914 Although Asbury Grove was not the first camp in Massachusetts (it was preceded by camps on Cape Cod and Wesleyan Grove on Martha's Vineyard) it was created specifically so that two dozen Methodist churches of the Lynn and Boston districts could have easier access to revival meetings.Vincent, 1858 Early years The first meeting at Asbury Grove was held in the third week of August, 1859, and attracted 2,000 people at its inception. Some reports state that by the end of that first week, the attendance had grown to nearly 12,000. As with other camp meetings in other towns, these were major events, often doubling or tripling (or, multiplying even further) a town's population during the gathering. The Circle at Asbury GroveReverend Gorham proposed that camp life should be modest, and most early camp meetings reflected this ideology by constructing only cloth tents (participants paid a small fee to rent a tent site) and wooden preaching stands. Gorham also encouraged the use of ‚Äúsociety tents‚Äù where smaller groups could meet to hold bible study and prayer meetings.Gorham, 1854 Asbury Grove's main preaching venue became The Circle, which was surrounded by 36 large tents (one for each of the member churches). These large tents had wood walls measuring six feet high, a canvas roof, and the ground inside was often covered in straw. Peak years A trolley at the Asbury Grove stop in the early 1900s The latter part of the 19th century saw the camp meeting movement gain momentum and vitality. The years from 1870 to 1879 marked the largest period of growth for the Asbury Grove camp. During this time, over 200 cottages were built. This was a marked change from the site's early years where the primary accommodations consisted of rough tents or open air campsites. The oldest surviving cottages were built closest to the prayer circle, with newer structures radiating outward from that point. Like other camps of the era, Asbury Grove slowly evolved to include permanent structures such as a dining hall, bakery, post office, and railroad ticket office. By 1875, the society tents were replaced by two story wood structures, five of which remain today. Camp participants came from a variety of socio- economic backgrounds.Beard, 2009 A resident directory from the late 19th and early 20th century includes entries for a shoe manufacturer, teamster, oil dealer, carpenter, and a tin ware dealer. This kind of diversity was part of the philosophy that camp meetings were to be retreats from every day life where participants focused on religious devotion and not worldly goods. A typical day at Asbury Grove began at 5:30 a.m. followed by breakfast served promptly ay 6:30 a.m. Preaching services were scheduled for 10:00 a.m., 3:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m., interrupted by lunch at noon, and the evening meal at 5:00 p.m. Each society also held a prayer meeting one half-hour after each meal. Curfew was at 10:00 p.m. each night, enforced by a policeman (and later, in the 1940s, by an Asbury Camp Meeting Association member) on patrol to look for people walking about or lights on inside cottages. Aside from a rigid structure to the day, personal activity was also regulated. No vehicles (wagons, automobiles, etc.) were permitted to enter during preaching services. Smoking was prohibited in the prayer circle at all times, and alcohol was strongly discouraged, even in private cottages and tents.  Decline  By the late 19th century, camp meetings were declining in popularity across the United States. This change had as much to do with society's movement away from the religious fervency of the 18th and 19th centuries as with the ease of travel caused by extensive railroad construction and the introduction of the automobile. A fire in 1927 caused extensive damage to the camp and many of the cottages were marred or destroyed entirely. A series of other fires and severe weather in the first half of the 20th century also damaged many of the cottages and the camp's property. Thereafter, a portion of the damaged structures were rebuilt, but some were left as empty lots or allowed to fall into disrepair. The Asbury Camp Meeting Association introduced more social activities in the late 19th and early 20th century. Though Methodist preaching was still a strong influence, programs for children and youths, bible conferences, patriotic rallies, and recreational activities such as baseball and tennis began to be offered. Present day Wesley House, one of the original Asbury Grove dormitories Still active today, Asbury Grove now covers 83 forested acres, set out in much the same pattern as the initial design. Historians believe this layout was heavily influenced by the Camp Meeting ManualRev. B. W. Gorham, 1854 as it adheres to a circular plan which was popular for camp meetings at the time. Although the land is owned by the Methodist church, many of the cottages are held as private residences and 100 of the remaining 153 adhere to their original design. About 30 of the structures are small modern homes or cottages that have been altered enough that they no longer retain their historical characteristics. Overall, the cottages are still used as summer residences, but 60 have been winterized for year-round use. 2009 marked the 150th anniversary of continuous annual camp meetings at Asbury Grove. In preparation, the Asbury Camp Meeting Association renovated many of the common buildings, including the tabernacle, kitchen, and dining hall. The camp has also hosted a number of worship services, social gatherings, cottage tours, theater productions, and sporting events in observance of this occasion.

It is a frazione of the comune of L'Aquila. It sits 584 meters above sea level at the base of Monte Manicola. The village of San Gregorio is 12.11 kilometers from the town of L'Aquila, of which it is considered a suburb community (Fraction or Frazione). Italy's SS17 Highway is its main transportation artery. The village sits near an active earthquake fault zone in the Valley of the Aterno- Pescara. Overview San Gregorio is a rural agricultural suburb of the city of L'Aquila and is closely tied to its history. The area has been inhabited for approximately 1,000 years and initially it did not have a defined city structure. During the Roman conquest, the fertility of the area guaranteed food production for Rome. During Medieval times San Gregorio was known for its Romanesque-church.L'Aquila: tourist guide book : history and tourist itineraries By Luigi Lopez, Attilio M. Cecchini. Publisher G. Tazzi, 1998 On April 6, 2009, at 01:32 GMT (03:32 CEST) an earthquake of 6.3 magnitude struck central Italy (See 2009 L'Aquila earthquake) with its epicenter near San Gregorio, at 42¬∞25‚Ä≤22‚Ä≥N, 13¬∞23‚Ä≤40‚Ä≥E. It is estimated that 12 residents were killed, 8 of whom were killed when the village's medieval church collapsed. It was estimated that 95% of San Gregorio's buildings received some type of damage during the earthquake. A huge tent city was constructed for residents, and a base camp was set up in the city for rescuers.

It is distributed in parts of North Brabant, especially in 's-Hertogenbosch and Tilburg and their surrounding regions. The paper's office is in 's-Hertogenbosch. History History of the Brabants Dagblad 18th century The history of Brabants Dagblad begins on 2 July 1771, when two printers in 's-Hertogenbosch, L.J. Bresser and C.A. Vi√©weg, started the s-Hertogenbossche Dingsdagse (en Vrydagse) Courant, a city paper published on Tuesdays and Fridays. 19th century The paper underwent a number of name changes and was banned in 1810 under the French domination. After more name changes, the paper, now called Provinciaal Dagblad and loyal to the monarchy, found itself in competition with two other local papers: the newly founded Roman Catholic De Noord- Brabander, the likewise Catholic Nieuwe Noord-Brabanter (until 1872), and after 1869 with yet another city paper, Het Huisgezin. 20th century By 1910, De Noord-Brabander, Het Huisgezin, and the Noord-Brabanter - Noordbrabantsch Dagblad (1895) had merged, and in 1941, forced by the German occupiers, this paper merged with what was now called De Provinciale and became the Noordbrabantsche Courant. This paper was halted after Dolle Dinsdag (5 September 1944), and restarted after the war was over. In 1946, the paper received the name Provinciaal Noordbrabantsche Courant - Het Huisgezin. On 3 January 1959, the paper received its current name, and from a paper focused on the city of 's-Hertogenbosch it changed to a more regional paper. In 1991, the Brabants Dagblad (then owned by VNU, the present The Nielsen Company) took over the competing paper in Tilburg, the Nieuwsblad. Theo Temmink became chief editor in 1994 but gave up his position in 1995; he had refused to move away from his hometown, Amsterdam, a decision which the board of directors could not condone. 21st century The chief editor since January 2006 is Annemieke Besseling, who had worked for the paper since 1989 as a regional editor, and was an editor at the main office since 2001. When she was appointed as chief editor, she became the first woman to run a Dutch newspaper. In 2007, the newspaper's format was switched to tabloid, along with all other Wegener papers, a decision announced in 2005 already; in that year, the Brabants Dagblad reported a 3% increase in circulation. The change in format was intended to allow for greater commensurability between Wegener's newspapers as a cost-cutting measure, given the decline in advertising revenues and the falling numbers of newspaper circulations throughout the Dutch market. In 2006 Wegener announced the loss of 300 jobs. Soon after Mecom's take-over of Wegener, it became clear that financially not all was well with the new parent company, which was looking for dominance in the European media market. In 2008, Besseling was one of seven editors of regional papers to sign a letter to Mecom's David Montgomery complaining about a lack of resources devoted to those papers by the parent company. Proposed cost- cutting measures led to protests and threats of strikes. In February 2009, Mecom's financial position was acknowledged to be weak (its stock had fallen 97%), and there were fears that the Brabants Nieuwsblad and the eight other Dutch papers owned by the group would cease to exist.

The fund's expense ratio is 1.7%, including 0.4% that is donated to the Global Echo Foundation. One potential concern investors may have about investing in GIVE is that they don't get a tax write-off for the portion of the management fee that is donated to the charitable foundation, whereas an individual donating the proceeds of a profitable investment to an eligible charity would be able to get a substantial tax write-off. In reaction to that, AdvisorShares lowered the management fee on GIVE to 0.80% and capped its net expense ratio at 0.99% in January 2017. GIVE finally closed on May 17, 2017.

Released by Paramount Pictures, it is known as Bow's first talkie. Plot The film focuses on an all-female college where the students are more interested in having fun and partying than studying. Stella Ames (Bow) is the most popular student, with a loud mouth. When the young and attractive professor Gilmore 'Gil' (March) starts working there in anthropology, all the girls immediately feel attracted to him. Stella recognizes him as the man she once accidentally shared a bed with, thereby risking her reputation. The professor is unamused by the girls' bad behavior and does not seem to notice who Stella is. At the end of term, a traditional costume party is held. Stella and her friends show up in revealing costumes and are therefore thrown out by Faith Morgan (Day), the head of the student body. The girls decide to go to a bar, where they are soon bothered by drunk men. They try to leave, but the men refuse to let them go. A bar fight soon ensues. All the girls are able to get away and leave with the car, but Stella is left behind. Fearing the worst, she decides to play along with the men so they will not force themselves on her. She is eventually rescued by professor Gilmore, who beats up the men. While taking her home, she tries to show her gratitude, but he is not moved by her, pointing out her scandalous lifestyle and lack of ambition. Hurt, she starts crying, but Gil states that he still would kill for her and kisses her. Eva catches them and soon spreads the word, but Stella threatens to ruin her life if she continues to. Stella denies the whole story, but admits to her best friend Helen (O'Hara) that she loves him. However, the next morning he acts as if nothing has happened, even giving her a hard time for committing plagiarism. Upset, she returns to her old lifestyle of wild parties, which includes dancing with and kissing strangers. However, when information reaches her that Gil has been shot, she realizes that she is still in love with him. A month later, Gil returns to college. Stella visits him, and he explains to her that he hates her for what she is and loves her for what she could be. They kiss, but are interrupted by Eva (Compton). Gil acts as if nobody else is there, but Eva notices Stella's presence. After she leaves, they enjoy a romantic evening until a fire drill interrupts them. While reporting to the dean, Helen loses a letter she has written to George, a man she is secretly seeing, despite the fact that it is prohibited for students to date. It turns out that Eva has found the letter and threatens to reveal both Helen and Stella's admirers. She later admits to their friend Babs that she has given the letter to Faith Morgan. Stella later tries to protect Helen and takes the blame, claiming that it was she who wrote the letter. She prepares to leave college, but Gil follows her on the train and they are reunited. He tells her that he does not believe her claim that she wrote the letter and announces that he has left college too.

One critic described her voice as a 'smooth contralto, vigorous and natural', while another said that she had a 'harsh tonal quality that is not very easy on sensitive eardrums'.Mayne, J. Directed by Dorothy Arzner, p.47 Variety stated that her voice was 'good enough' to survive the transition to sound.

Business relationship management consists of knowledge, skills, and behaviors (or competencies) that foster a productive relationship between a service organization (e.g. Human Resources, Information technology, a finance department, or an external provider) and their business partners. BRM is distinct from enterprise relationship management and customer relationship management although it is related. It is of larger scope than a liaison who aligns business interests with IT deliverables. Trends driving BRM development Strategic business partners (what used to be referred to as shared services or service providers) require a common methodology to drive true business innovation and strategy. These strategic business partners (IT, Finance, HR, external providers, etc.) are converging with the business. There is one shared business strategy with each business partner accountable for portions of the overall business value achieved. Business Relationship Management Institute, Inc started promoting this business capability in 2012 with a non-profit membership community dedicated to the BRM profession. These features include: * Business Relationship Management focuses on business value realization through accountable business partners * advances in the scale, scope, and sophistication of the network effect * constant disruption as the 'new normal' business dynamicThe New Reality: Constant Disruption * decentralization of knowledge and the devaluation of traditional intellectual propertyAbandon Stocks, Embrace FlowsParticipation Revolution * increased openness of networked knowledgeJohn Chambers, CEO of Cisco at MIT, on Enterprise 2.0 * decline of command and control management\\"Command and control is dead\\": the shape of next gen organizations is social networks The impact of these trends on business relationships have driven the foundation of a distinct BRM discipline. Overview and goals BRM is implemented via organizational roles, a discipline, and an organizational capability. As a discipline The BRM discipline is research-based and has been verified and enhanced for over a decade. It is used in organizations worldwide and is effective for shared services, external service providers and others. A goal of the discipline is to enable stakeholders to develop, evaluate, and use high-value networking relationships. As an organizational role The BRM organizational role is a link between a service provider and the business. The role acts as a connector, orchestrator, and navigator between the service provider and one or more business units. As a model One goal of BRM is to provide a complete model of business relationships and their value over time, in order to make their various aspects both explicit and measurable. A mature BRM model will ultimately support strategic business research and development efforts as well as tools and techniques that implement BRM principles. The approach to the BRM modeling process is to identify and describe various aspects of business relationships in terms of: * defined relationship types, in which each type has a specified purpose, associated roles, and a measurable outcome * a set of processes that make up the business relationship lifecycles * a set of principles that apply specifically to these lifecycle processes Assets and products derived from the BRM model are meant to inform and support: * A practice derived from applying BRM principles, analyzing outcomes, and refining over multiple iterations * A platform derived from successful practice that further support and optimize BRM as a discipline The BRM model will identify and categorize business relationships according to type. Each type has a discrete and clear purpose, characterized by a unique combination of roles, functions, and activities, and instances of each type can be identified, quantified, and analyzed. Some examples of these relationship types are business-to-business, business-to-consumer, and business-to-employee. The BRM model identifies two roles, provider and consumer; a given business by necessity participates in both roles. BRM lifecycles The concept of the business relationship lifecycleValue creation in the relationship life cycle: A quasi-longitudinal analysisCapturing value creation in business relationships: A customer perspective builds on charting the complex changing values of business relationships over time in contrast to simple transactional value. Examples of BRM lifecycles include: * A large- scale grow and sustain cycle, characterized by one-to-many and many-to-one relationships. Activities in this cycle are more or less continuous and overlapping, such as marketing, customer product support or maintenance, or online community. These have indeterminate outcomes. * A small-scale (micro) engagement cycle, characterized by one-to-one, discrete or transactional relationships. These have discrete cycles and negotiated outcomes. BRM principles ;Measurement and analysis The goals of BRM require that its concepts and principles be identifiable and measurable. Given the model, a person should be able to identify the business relationships that they are engaged in, and measure them in terms like quantity or duration. The same holds for any aspect of BRM, such as type, role, or principle. ;Purpose Every business relationship has a purpose that requires the participation of multiple roles to accomplish. The purpose of a given business relationship is discrete and quantifiable. ;Reputation and trust The BRM model should attempt to model and quantify reputation and trust. Every relationship, and every interaction within it, contributes to reputation. Reputation mitigates risk and reduces friction within business processes. Concern for reputation incentivizes good behavior. Absence of trust will cause a business relationship to fail. Trust increases efficiency and enables conflict resolution. The relationship between trust as a traditional core conceptTrust in Business: The Core Concepts and in its emerging 'radical' form as a component of online communityRadical Trust must be described. ;Governance The goal of effective business relationship governance is achieving both cooperation and coordination between business actors. They can rely on either contractual or relational mechanisms, or (most of the times) both, to facilitate the governance of business relationships. The BRM model needs to account for and align with models of corporate governance, including business ethics, legal constraints, and social norms as they apply to business relationships. ;Boundaries The BRM model should define the boundaries of business relationships within the larger continuum of interpersonal relationships. In addition to governance issues, the model should examine if there are optimal levels of personal connection, and whether they differ by type, role, or other attribute. The model should help define boundaries that optimize effectiveness while supporting good governance practices. ;Exchange and reciprocity The BRM model of exchange and reciprocity must extend traditional dimensions to account for not only financial exchange, but also time, money, knowledge, and reputation exchanges. These are a key feature of business relationships. Business Relationship Management Institute (BRMI) In 2013, the Business Relationship Management Institute (BRMI) was founded, which publishes a guide that offers a \\"comprehensive foundation-level overview of the art and practice of Business Relationship Management.\\" BRMI offers a Business Relationship Management Professional (BRMP) designation, as well as a Certified Business Relationship Manager (CBRM) designation.

Design and development The Bell D-292 was developed under the US Army's Advanced Composite Airframe Program (ACAP), which was a project to develop an all-composite helicopter fuselage, considerably lighter and less costly to build than predominantly metal airframes, in support of the LHX program. In February 1981, contracts were awarded to Sikorsky and Bell Helicopters, with Sikorsky submitting the S-75. Both companies were to build three airframes, one tool-proof version, one static-test version and a flight- test vehicle. The Bell D-292 used the Avco Lycoming engines, transmission, two-bladed main and tail rotors, tailboom, vertical fin, and rotor pylon from the Bell 222. The new airframe replaced metal with composites for greater strength, reduced weight and both lower manufacturing and maintenance costs. The D-292 serial number 85-24371 flew for the first time on 30 August 1985 following delays due to funding and industrial problems.

On October 1, 2009, operations were stopped until further notice by the Board of Directors. On November 5, 2009, InkStop filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. History  Beginnings  InkStop store, Livonia, Michigan In 2004, InkStop founder and CEO, Dirk Kettlewell, was Vice President of Technology at OfficeMax, but decided to leave based on the impending move of the company headquarters to Chicago by Boise Cascade, which acquired OfficeMax in 2003. He took with him his eventual wife, Dawn (Callahan) Kettlewell, who was Vice President of Merchandising at OfficeMax, and several others to create InkStop, which was to be focused on profiting from mainly ink and toner sales in smaller stores giving convenience and better customer service than the competition. Fast growth After its first location opened up in Independence, Ohio in 2006, InkStop grew to operate as many as 162 stores in 14 states. In April 2009, RBC Global Capital Markets ranked the company one of the 30 fastest-growing retailers nationwide. Abrupt end On October 1, 2009, after calls were made and a memo was sent out at the end of the day of business, all operations were ceased immediately by the Board of Directors, which includes former NFL quarterback Boomer Esiason. The employees were not given their last two paychecks following this action. On November 5, 2009, InkStop filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The filing states the company owes $48.3 million to more than a 1,000 creditors. The company also owes $1.1 million to its former employees for wages not paid for the last 3 weeks worked as well as vacation pay and unpaid expenses. At the December 5, 2009 bankruptcy hearing, it was learned that several investors were paid nearly $5.3 million to its directors and senior managers, including \\"$109,268 to Norman \\"Boomer\\" Esiason.\\" Legal actions  Warren et al. v.

It can be found in the Mojave and Sonoran Deserts at elevations of up to 1400 m (4600 feet).Hawksworth, F.G., & D. Wiens. 1993. Viscaceae, Mistletoe Family. Journal of the Arizona-Nevada Academy of Science 27:241-245. The mistletoe is a leafless plant that attaches to host plants, often leguminous woody desert trees such as Cercidium and Prosopis.Spurrier, S., Smith, K.G. (2006). Desert mistletoe (Phoradendron californicum) infestation correlates with blue palo verde (Cercidium floridum) mortality during a severe drought in the Mojave Desert. Journal of Arid Environments. 69, 189-197. Desert mistletoe takes water and minerals from its host plants but it does its own photosynthesis, making it a hemiparasite. During the winter it produces inconspicuous, fragrant flowers. Female desert mistletoe plants produce red to clear berries that are eaten by the phainopepla (Phainopepla nitens), a silky flycatcher, which then spreads the seeds. Phainopeplas cannot digest the seed of desert mistletoe, so the birds disperse the seeds when they defecate or wipe their bills. Human Use Common names include visco, toj√≠, tzavo, secapalo, injerto, and chili de espino in Spanish; aaxt in Seri.Soule, J. A. 2010. Father Kino's Herbs: Growing Them & Using Them Today. Tierra del Sol Institute. Tucson, AZ. The white to reddish fruits are edible, but native tribes ate only the fruits of mistletoes growing on mesquite (Prosopis), ironwood (Olneya tesota) or catclaw acacia (Acacia greggii). Found growing on palo verdes (Parkinsonia) or Condalia (desert buckthorn) the fruits are considered inedible.Nabhan, G. P. 1985. Gathering the Desert. University of Arizona Press, Tucson, AZ. The Seri people consider desert mistletoe fruit ripe and harvestable once it turns translucent. Harvest is done by spreading a blanket below the plant and hitting it with sticks to release the fruit. Seri consumed the fruit raw.Felger, R. S. and M. B. Moser. 1985. People of the Desert and Sea. University of Arizona Press, Tucson, AZ. The Tohono O'odham also consumed the fruit raw. River Pima ate the fruit boiled and mashed, which made it the consistency of a pudding. The Cahilla gathered the fruits November through April and boiled them into a paste with a sprinkle of wood ash added to the pot.Ebling, W. 1986. Handbook of Indian Foods and Fibers of Arid America. University of California Press, Berkeley, CA. Hodgson, W. C. 2001. Food Plants of the Sonoran Desert. University of Arizona Press, Tucson, AZ. Desert mistletoe plants, but not the berries, contain phoratoxins which can easily lead to death via slowed heart rate, increased blood pressure, convulsions, or cardiac arrest. Some of these compounds can cause hallucinations, but there is no way to judge dosage. People seeking a \\"high\\" from mistletoe still turn up in morgues each year. Native peoples used plants other than desert mistletoe to seek visions. Amateur entrepreneurs in Tucson, Phoenix and other cities in the Sonoran Desert frequently sell cuttings of desert mistletoe on street corners during the Christmas season. This is despite the fact that the species looks very different from other mistletoes traditionally used as holiday decorations elsewhere.

The company was created on June 21, 1927 through the merger of the Kokomo Steel and Wire Company (founded in Kokomo, Indiana in 1901) with the Superior Sheet Steel Company of Canton, Ohio, and the Chapman Price Steel Company of Indianapolis. Among the original eleven directors was John E. Fredrick, who had been an organizer of the Kokomo Fence Machine Company in 1896 and had served on the board of directors of the Kokomo Steel and Wire Company. Fredrick served as first Chairman of the Board of Continental Steel, whose headquarters were established in Kokomo. The Kokomo operations of this corporation, however, continued to employ the Kokomo Steel and Wire name until 1944.Continental Steel‚ÄîIts Origin and History,rev. ed. (Kokomo, Indiana: Continental Steel Corporation, 1963), 3‚Äì13; \\"Continental Steel,\\" Kokomo Tribune, February 23, 1996, D2. Continental Steel was dissolved in 1986, due to bankruptcy. Early operations Within a year of its founding, the various plants of Continental Steel employed 2288 individuals, a new bar mill was in operation, and the firm was preparing to produce its first steel. Continental Steel would become, at one time, the largest employer in Kokomo, with a workforce approximating 3000 at its peak. In 1929, the construction of a sheet rolling plant and sheet galvanizing units at Kokomo were authorized, with production in the sheet mill beginning that summer.Continental Steel, 15‚Äì17; Kokomo Tribune, July 27, 1929, 9. Continental was able to surmount the rigors of the great depression of the 1930s, and in 1936 its stocks, listed on the Chicago Stock Exchange since 1929, were admitted on the New York Stock Exchange. Its earnings for 1935 had reached over one million dollars, with total assets valued at more than $18,000,000.Continental Steel, 17‚Äì20; New York Times, March 26, 1936, 37. During the Second World War Continental produced large tonnages of barbed wire, nails and sheet steel for military use, and it provided material for products manufactured by defense industries. These included aerial bombs, fuel containers and landing mats for air strips.Continental Steel, 20‚Äì21. Expansion and growth In 1946 and 1947, Continental Steel sold off its Canton, Ohio and Indianapolis sheet mill facilities, having decided to focus on the manufacture of finished products at Kokomo. The 1950s witnessed considerable expansion: a new continuous rod mill started operations in 1953, a welded fabric department was housed in a new facility in 1955; the mail mill was modernized, and a new nail warehouse was built in 1957; 1959 saw the production of a new item, high carbon wire. By 1963, Continental Steel's open hearth capacity had grown to 420,000 net tons through the enlargement of existing furnaces. The prospering company was producing a wide range of products including fences, gates, posts, welded wire fabric, nails, a variety of wires, clothes lines rivets, and copper steel (Konik) sheets. Continental Steel,21-24-36. Penn-Dixie Corporation take- over An important turning point for the company took place in the late 1960s. In 1968, Jerome Castle, president of the Penn-Dixie Cement Corporation of New York, acknowledged that his company was in the process of purchasing hundreds of thousands of shares of Continental Steel; by 1969, a takeover was completed and the Kokomo operations formally took on the Penn-Dixie name five years later.\\"Continental Steel,\\" Kokomo Tribune, February 23, 1996, D2; New York Times, July 23, 1968, 47 and July 25, 1968, 47; Kokomo Tribune,January 7, 1969, 20. This takeover was part of a current trend within the American steel industry in which individual steel companies were merged with conglomerates. Ten such mergers took place in 1968 and 1969, including the absorption of Jones and Laughlin Steel by the Ling-Temco-Vought Corporation, and the merger of Youngstown Steel with the Lykes Corporation.William T. Hogan, S.J., World Steel in the 1980s: A Case of Survival (Lexington, Massachusetts: Lexington Books, 1983), 113; William Scheuerman, The Steel Crisis: The Economics and Politics of a Declining Industry (New York: Praeger Publishers, 1986), 73‚Äì75. Challenges and setbacks The next decade and a half proved to be a period of tremendous challenges and setbacks for Continental Steel and for the American steel industry as a whole. Despite a worldwide steel boom in 1973‚Äì1974, American producers were confronted by labor disputes, the costs of modernizing an aging infrastructure, environmental issues and foreign competition from Europe and Japan.Hogan, 1‚Äì2, 97, 191‚Äì217. In 1971 Continental Steel experienced a contentious strike involving the issue of pension funds. Critics accused Castle of mismanagement and of wresting maximum profits from operations without investing sufficient capital into expansion and modernization. In 1977, Castle was dismissed from his posts at Penn-Dixie for selling Florida swampland to the corporation far above its actual worth. Two years later, he was convicted of defrauding Penn-Dixie in this conspiracy and sentenced to 15 months in prison.\\"Continental Steel,\\" KokomoTribune, February 23, 1996, D4; \\"Penn-Dixie Industries may look like a slum, but to Jerry Castle, it's Fat City, U.S.A.,\\" Forbes, June 15, 1976, 21‚Äì23; Joel Kotkin, \\"A Commitment Forged in Steel, Inc.,5 (June, 1983), 82‚Äì83; New York Times, May 27, 1977, 70 and August 30, 1979, D1; Dan Dornman, \\"An Invitation for Dining, Disco-Dancing...and the S.E.C.\\" New York, May 9, 1977, 12‚Äì13. Bankruptcies and demise Troubles continued to plague Penn-Dixie. In 1980, the firm filed for Chapter 11 reorganization bankruptcy. On January 29, 1982, the company was able to obtain concessions from its United Steelworkers local that reduced labor costs by $2 an hour, and it agreed to pass on the savings to its employees once the company attained profitability.John P. Hoerr, And the wolf finally came: The Decline of the American Steel Industry (Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press, 1988), 65; New York Times, April 8, 1980, D5. In March 1982, it emerged from bankruptcy, having shed all its operations with the exception of the steel division. The company reorganized under the name Continental Steel Corporation, with its headquarters being relocated from New York to Kokomo. Expenditures were made in 1984‚Äì1985 on a new continuous rod mill and a continuous billet caster in hope that this would salvage the company, but the business continued to decline. In late 1985, Continental Steel again sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy, hoping for another opportunity to reorganize, but in February of the following year its creditors were successful in having the Chapter 11 reorganization converted to Chapter 7 liquidation. On February 17, 1986, Continental Steel shut down what remained of its operations in Kokomo, leaving over 700 workers jobless.Wall Street Journal, November 26, 1985, 1; \\"Continental Steel,\\" Kokomo Tribune, February 23, 1996, D2-D3; Kokomo Tribune, October 12, 1986, 4. Pension and environmental controversies Even after its closing Continental Steel generated controversy. Embittered workers, who had earlier been led by management to believe that their pensions were secure, discovered that this was not the case. The dispute that ensued was only partially resolved through compensation provided by the Federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.Kokomo Tribune, February 27, 1986, 1; \\"Continental Steel, Kokomo Tribune, February 23, 1996, D4. In its last few years of operation, Continental Steel had encountered problems with the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) and the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) due to alleged improper disposal of hazardous wastes and PCBs, and in March 1989, the area that it had occupied was declared a Superfund site, with the EPA and IDEM sharing responsibilities for a massive, costly cleanup which would include the decontamination and demolition of its plant buildings in 1999‚Äì2000. While considerable progress has been made over the past two decades, decontamination efforts continue, accompanied by vigorous discussion and debate in Kokomo concerning what use might be made of this property in the future.\\"Continental Steel,\\" Kokomo Tribune, February 23, 1996, D3-D5; Kokomo Tribune, June 9, 2005, A1, A10; June 25, 2006, C1, C6; June 13, 2007, A10; New York Times, November 10, 2003, A12; Indiana Department of Environmental Management, \\"Second Five year Review Report for Continental Steel Superfund Site, City of Kokomo, Howard County, Indiana,\\" ; Scott Smith, \\"Continental Steel Cleanup Moves to Quarry,\\" June 8, 2008, In 2016, the site was converted into a solar energy park, which began operating on December 29, 2016.

Location  The ruins of the castle are on the castle hill above the town of Kastellaun and are connected to the former wall of the town.  History  Constructed in the 13th century, the castle is first mentioned in 1226 as Kestilun, a possession of the Count of Sponheim. In 1301 it was the residence of Simon II, Count of Sponheim-Kreuznach. In 1321, Archbishop Baldwin of Trier besieged the castle. In 1325 he built the neighbouring Burg Balduinseck as a challenge to Sponheim. After Walram of Sponheim-Kreuznach abandoned Kastellaun in 1340, the castle was administered by bailiffs and burgm√§nner. The line of the counts of Sponheim subsequently died out and the castle descended with the title to Bernhard II, Margrave of Baden and Count Friedrich of Veldenz, who ruled jointly in a \\"condominium\\". The last Count of Veldenz died in 1444 and his share of the rulership passed to his son-in-law Stefan, Count Palatine of Simmern-Zweibr√ºcken. This drew the Rear County of Sponheim into the Palatine sphere of influence, involving it in war and the possession of the Palatinate. In 1594 Edward Fortunatus retreated to Castle Kastellaun after losing the Margravate of Baden, and it became a residence again. During the Thirty Years' War, from 1618 to 1648, the castle was occupied. During the War of the Palatine Succession, in 1689, it was destroyed by French troops and was not rebuilt. In 1820 the ruins came into private hands. In 1884 the municipality of Kastellaun bought them and made the first repairs to stabilise them. From 1990 to 1993 the hill and the ruins there were cleaned up. The lower castle and access were restored.  Architecture  Ruins of the bergfried The castle consists of an inner and outer baileys. The inner ward includes the remains of the defensive bergfried, the enceinte and two residential buildings. The older east building dates to the 14th century; excavations in 1990-93 uncovered its cellar. The ruin on the west side of the inner bailey that can be seen from far away is what remains of the east end of the palas and the adjacent rectangular powder tower. Both of these buildings were probably built no earlier than the 16th century. On the east side, facing the town, there is a secondary defensive wall or zwinger. In the outer bailey, two modern buildings now stand on old foundations. Originally entry to the castle was by way of a gate tower in the north corner. The current entrance is modern.  Present-day use  The former palas (residential building with the great hall) is used as an open-air stage for theatrical performances. Restaurateurs now operate in the castle cellars and parts of the new buildings constructed on old foundations in the lower castle during 2006-07. They offer among other things medieval-style feasts. In addition, on Sundays in summer the municipality of Kastellaun offers a children's activity programme. Further special events attract particularly large numbers of visitors to the ruin. On 9 September 2007, a documentation centre was dedicated in the lower bailey. It issues a pamphlet on the most important events in the region from early times to the present. On the ground floor, in a \\"House of Regional History\\", the primary stages of the Celtic and Roman past of the Kastellaun region are displayed. A reconstruction of the wagon burial discovered in Bell in 1938, remains of Celtic pottery, fibul√¶ and jewellery, and a model of a Roman legionary's helmet convey an impression of how our ancestors once lived. The first floor depicts the life of the knights and nobility in castles in Hunsr√ºck during the Middle Ages. On the upper floor are models and information about the former Pydna missile base and the Hunsr√ºck peace movement as well as the current usage as a federal defence installation and festival site (Nature One).

Its primary use is in creating database-driven dynamic web page applications. Released in 1995, the name was registered as a trademark in 1998.Trademark registration details WebDNA is currently maintained by WebDNA Software Corporation.  Notable features  WebDNA contains a RAM-resident database system (Hybrid In- memory database) that has searching and editing capabilities. A resilient and persistent backup of the RAM databases is maintained to disk. WebDNA code can interweave with css, html/html5 and js/ajax, allowing to mix layout with programming and server-side with client-side scripting. Some instructions allow to interact with remote servers. It is usually considered as an easy-to- learn scripting language and has been designed for webmasters, webdesigners and programmers looking for quick results. WebDNA is made up of a syntax that uses square brackets (\\"[\\" \\"]\\") and the English language. For example, to display today's date on a web page, simply insert \\"[date]\\" within the HTML or CSS code where you want the live date to appear; likewise with \\"[time]\\". To show some text only to a specific client IP address request, the 'showif' context can be used: [showif [ipaddress]=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx]Some Text[/showif]. Most WebDNA tags, contexts and commands follow similar conventions.WebDNA Programming Reference  Terminology  The WebDNA syntax is based on a simple format: :: key names surrounded by square brackets, such as: [showif [tvar]=yes]Yes[/showif]. WebDNA instructions are based on two types: * Tag :: single key surrounded by square brackets, such as [ipaddress] (the I.P. Address of a Client (computing) request) * Context :: opening tag and closing tag that surrounds what is to be parsed. ie. [Format thousands .3d]7[/Format] (parses to '007') Parameters can be included in many of the Tags, Contexts or Commands.WebDNA References Example Code (connects to a whois server and shows the information, then stores it into a permanent database) [text]info=[tcpconnect host=whois.domaindiscover.com&port;=43] [tcpsend]webdna.us[unurl]%0D%0A[/unurl][/tcpsend] [/tcpconnect][/text] [append db=base.db]domain=webdna.us&whois;=[info] [/append]  History  According to Grant Hulbert,About Grant Hulbert one of the Pacific Coast Software founders, WebCatalog (now WebDNA) began as a set of C macros to help accomplish website graphical tasks.Pre-WebDNA Release Details > Before WebDNA evolved into a general-purpose server-side language, it was a > special-purpose server-side language designed to help create web pages that > sold stock photography. It had shopping cart features, and a searchable > fixed-field database with specialized fields for storing stock photo > information. After that, Pacific Coast Software quickly saw the value in > creating a web programming language. WebCatalog began its mid-1990s public debut on the Macintosh platform. As its name implies, it had an early development focus that allowed a web master or store administrator to migrate a traditional product catalog to an online catalog. This was most evident in 1997 and 1998, with its StoreBuilder and WebMerchant products that allowed for a user to quickly build a store front online. The term \\"WebCatalog\\" referred to the entire product, where the term \\"WebDNA\\" referred to the scripting syntax only. Around the year 2000, WebCatalog and Pacific Coast Software were purchased by Smith Micro Software, Inc. Smith Micro Software, Inc. then changed the name of WebCatalog to WebDNA, which at that point became a name that referenced all aspects of the product. Starting with the release of WebDNA version 4.0 and ending with version 6.0a, the years 1999 to 2004 were very active years for WebDNA and the scripting language was adopted by many national and international names, including Disney, Chrysler, Kodak, Ben and Jerry's, the Pillsbury Dough Boy Shop, the NCAA Final Four and the Museum of Television and Radio. Also during this time, development of the language gained contemporary tools, such as [function] and [scope], that lend themselves to Modular programming and Structured programming.WebDNA Technical Change History From 2005 to 2008, for perhaps various reasons including the success of Smith Micro Software with other products,Smith Micro Success 2006 to 2007 WebDNA users began to lose support from Smith Micro. WebDNA lost users against free solutions like PHP and MySQL. It was ultimately the developers of WebDNA who revived the language. In June 2008, they formed together and organized to establish WebDNA Software Corporation (WSC). WSC purchased the intellectual property that is WebDNA, and in 2009, WSC released a new WebDNA version 6.2 (Cicada). In December 2011, a FastCGI version for the WebDNA Engine was released. This version, along with offering compatibility for non-Apache installations, changes the scope of WebDNA from a server-wide application, to a domain name-specific application. This means that a website owner can now more easily install WebDNA specifically for one domain, without affecting other domains that may reside on the server.

The Author Nothing is known about him for certain. The name is probably a nom- de-plume. Based on what may be inferred from his writing, he was a very well- educated courtier whose audience consisted of young men in the lower nobility with plenty of leisure time and a fondness for amusing stories involving warriors and courtesans. He may also have been an orator/actor who developed his stories through performance and only later wrote them down. He is believed to have lived somewhere between the twelfth to fourteenth centuries AD. The Tales Though often attributed to Bhavabhuti, the true origin of these tales is lost in antiquity. They appear to have been part of a large corpus of KathƒÅ (narrative tales) about VikramƒÅditya that were first written down in Kashmir during the eleventh century. Several versions exist, the best-known being those by ≈öivadƒÅsa and Jambhaladatta.Jambhaladatta‚Äôs Version of the VetƒÅlapa√±cavin≈õati; a critical Sanskrit text in transliteration, with an introduction, and English translation, by Murray Barnson Emeneau.

While planning what to do, he encounters a Vetala (a form of genie that inhabits and animates corpses). He asks for the Vetala's help. He is then told twenty-five stories, each of which end with a riddle he must solve to prove his wisdom and knowledge. After solving all the riddles, the genie helps him to vanquish his enemy. The story is told in the Champu literary style, (a mixture of prose and verse), which suggests the possibility of Jain influence.

One important signature of visual object recognition is \\"object invariance\\", or the ability to identify objects across changes in the detailed context in which objects are viewed, including changes in illumination, object pose, and background context. Ullman, S. (1996) High Level Vision, MIT Press  Basic stages of object recognition  Neuropsychological evidence affirms that there are four specific stages identified in the process of object recognition. Riddoch, M., & Humphreys, G. (2001). Object Recognition. In B. Rapp (Ed.), Handbook of Cognitive Neuropsychology. Hove: Psychology Press.Ward, J. (2006). The Student's Guide to Cognitive Neuroscience. New York: Psychology Press. These stages are: :Stage 1 Processing of basic object components, such as color, depth, and form. :Stage 2 These basic components are then grouped on the basis of similarity, providing information on distinct edges to the visual form. Subsequently, figure-ground segregation is able to take place. :Stage 3 The visual representation is matched with structural descriptions in memory. :Stage 4 Semantic attributes are applied to the visual representation, providing meaning, and thereby recognition. Within these stages, there are more specific processes that take place to complete the different processing components. In addition, other existing models have proposed integrative hierarchies (top-down and bottom-up), as well as parallel processing, as opposed to this general bottom-up hierarchy.  Hierarchical recognition processing  Visual recognition processing is typically viewed as a bottom-up hierarchy in which information is processed sequentially with increasing complexities. During this process, lower-level cortical processors, such as the primary visual cortex, are at the bottom of the hierarchy. Higher-level cortical processors, such as the inferotemporal cortex (IT), are at the top, where visual recognition is facilitated. A highly recognized bottom-up hierarchical theory is James DiCarlo's Untangling description whereby each stage of the hierarchically arranged ventral visual pathway performs operations to gradually transform object representations into an easily extractable format. In contrast, an increasingly popular recognition processing theory, is that of top-down processing. One model, proposed by Moshe Bar (2003), describes a \\"shortcut\\" method in which early visual inputs are sent, partially analyzed, from the early visual cortex to the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Possible interpretations of the crude visual input is generated in the PFC and then sent to the inferotemporal cortex (IT) subsequently activating relevant object representations which are then incorporated into the slower, bottom-up process. This \\"shortcut\\" is meant to minimize the number of object representations required for matching thereby facilitating object recognition. Lesion studies have supported this proposal with findings of slower response times for individuals with PFC lesions, suggesting use of only the bottom-up processing.  Object constancy and theories of object recognition  A significant aspect of object recognition is that of object constancy: the ability to recognize an object across varying viewing conditions. These varying conditions include object orientation, lighting, and object variability (size, color, and other within-category differences). For the visual system to achieve object constancy, it must be able to extract a commonality in the object description across different viewpoints and the retinal descriptions.[9] Participants who did categorization and recognition tasks while undergoing a functional magnetic found as increased blood flow indicating activation in specific regions of the brain. The categorization task consisted of participants placing objects from canonical or unusual views as either indoor or outdoor objects. The recognition task occurs by presenting the participants with images that they had viewed previously. Half of these images were in the same orientation as previously shown, while the other half were presented in the opposing viewpoint. The brain regions implicated in mental rotation, such as the ventral and dorsal visual pathways and the prefrontal cortex, showed the greatest increase in blood flow during these tasks, demonstrating that they are critical for the ability to view objects from multiple angles. Several theories have been generated to provide insight on how object constancy may be achieved for the purpose of object recognition including, viewpoint-invariant, viewpoint-dependent and multiple views theories.  Viewpoint-invariant theories  Viewpoint-invariant theories suggest that object recognition is based on structural information, such as individual parts, allowing for recognition to take place regardless of the object's viewpoint. Accordingly, recognition is possible from any viewpoint as individual parts of an object can be rotated to fit any particular view.[10] This form of analytical recognition requires little memory as only structural parts need to be encoded, which can produce multiple object representations through the interrelations of these parts and mental rotation.[10] Participants in a study were presented with one encoding view from each of 24 preselected objects, as well as five filler images. Objects were then represented in the central visual field at either the same orientation or a different orientation than the original image. Then participants were asked to name if the same or different depth- orientation views of these objects presented. The same procedure was then executed when presenting the images to the left or right visual field. Viewpoint-dependent priming was observed when test views were presented directly to the right hemisphere, but not when test views were presented directly to the left hemisphere. The results support the model that objects are stored in a manner that is viewpoint dependent because the results did not depend on whether the same or a different set of parts could be recovered from the different-orientation views. = 3-D model representation = This model, proposed by Marr and Nishihara (1978), states that object recognition is achieved by matching 3-D model representations obtained from the visual object with 3-D model representations stored in memory as vertical shape precepts. Through the use of computer programs and algorithms, Yi Yungfeng (2009) was able to demonstrate the ability for the human brain to mentally construct 3D images using only the 2D images that appear on the retina. Their model also demonstrates a high degree of shape constancy conserved between 2D images, which allow the 3D image to be recognized. The 3-D model representations obtained from the object are formed by first identifying the concavities of the object, which separate the stimulus into individual parts. Recent research suggests that an area of the brain, known as the caudal intraparietal area (CIP), is responsible for storing the slant and tilt of a plan surface that allow for concavity recognition. Rosenburg et al. implanted monkeys with a scleral search coil for monitoring eye position while simultaneously recording single neuron activation from neurons within the CIP. During the experiment, monkeys sat 30 cm away from an LCD screen that displayed the visual stimuli. Binocular disparity cues were displayed on the screen by rendering stimuli as green-red anaglyphs and the slant-tilt curves ranged from 0 to 330. A single trial consisted of a fixation point and then the presentation of a stimulus for 1 second. Neuron activation were then recorded using the surgically inserted micro electrodes. These single neuron activation for specific concavities of objects lead to the discovery that each axis of an individual part of an object containing concavity are found in memory stores. Identifying the principal axis of the object assists in the normalization process via mental rotation that is required because only the canonical description of the object is stored in memory. Recognition is acquired when the observed object viewpoint is mentally rotated to match the stored canonical description. Figure 1. This image, created based on Biederman's (1987) Recognition by Components theory, is an example of how objects can be broken down into Geons. = Recognition by components = An extension of Marr and Nishihara's model, the recognition-by-components theory, proposed by Biederman (1987), proposes that the visual information gained from an object is divided into simple geometric components, such as blocks and cylinders, also known as \\"geons\\" (geometric ions), and are then matched with the most similar object representation that is stored in memory to provide the object's identification (see Figure 1).  Viewpoint-dependent theories  Viewpoint-dependent theories suggest that object recognition is affected by the viewpoint at which it is seen, implying that objects seen in novel viewpoints reduce the accuracy and speed of object identification. This theory of recognition is based on a more holistic system rather than by parts, suggesting that objects are stored in memory with multiple viewpoints and angles. This form of recognition requires a lot of memory as each viewpoint must be stored. Accuracy of recognition also depends on how familiar the observed viewpoint of the object is.Peterson, M. A., & Rhodes, G. (Eds.). (2003). Perception of Faces, Objects and Scenes: Analytic and Holistic Processes. New York: Oxford University Press.  Multiple views theory  This theory proposes that object recognition lies on a viewpoint continuum where each viewpoint is recruited for different types of recognition. At one extreme of this continuum, viewpoint-dependent mechanisms are used for within-category discriminations, while at the other extreme, viewpoint-invariant mechanisms are used for the categorization of objects.  Neural substrates  The Dorsal Stream is shown in green and the Ventral Stream in purple.  The dorsal and ventral stream  The visual processing of objects in the brain can be divided into two processing pathways: the dorsal stream (how/where), which extends from the visual cortex to the parietal lobes, and ventral stream (what), which extends from the visual cortex to the inferotemporal cortex (IT). The existence of these two separate visual processing pathways was first proposed by Ungerleider and Mishkin (1982) who, based on their lesion studies, suggested that the dorsal stream is involved in the processing of visual spatial information, such as object localization (where), and the ventral stream is involved in the processing of visual object identification information (what).Ungerleider, L.G., Mishkin, M., 1982. Two cortical visual systems.In: Ingle, D.J., Goodale, M.A., Mansfield, R.J.W. (Eds.), Analysis of Visual Behavior. InMIT Press, Cambridge, pp. 549‚Äì586. Since this initial proposal, it has been alternatively suggested that the dorsal pathway should be known as the 'How' pathway as the visual spatial information processed here provides us with information about how to interact with objects, For the purpose of object recognition, the neural focus is on the ventral stream.  Functional specialization in the ventral stream  Within the ventral stream, various regions of proposed functional specialization have been observed in functional imaging studies. The brain regions most consistently found to display functional specialization are the fusiform face area (FFA), which shows increased activation for faces when compared with objects, the parahippocampal place area (PPA) for scenes vs. objects, the extrastriate body area (EBA) for body parts vs. objects, MT+/V5 for moving stimuli vs. static stimuli, and the Lateral Occipital Complex (LOC) for discernible shapes vs. scrambled stimuli. (See also: Neural processing for individual categories of objects) = Structural processing: the lateral occipital complex = The lateral occipital complex (LOC) has been found to be particularly important for object recognition at the perceptual structural level. In an event-related fMRI study that looked at the adaptation of neurons activated in visual processing of objects, it was discovered that the similarity of an object's shape is necessary for subsequent adaptation in the LOC, but specific object features such as edges and contours are not. This suggests that activation in the LOC represents higher-level object shape information and not simple object features. In a related fMRI study, the activation of the LOC, which occurred regardless of the presented object's visual cues such as motion, texture, or luminance contrasts, suggests that the different low-level visual cues used to define an object converge in \\"object-related areas\\" to assist in the perception and recognition process. None of the mentioned higher-level object shape information seems to provide any semantic information about the object as the LOC shows a neuronal response to varying forms including non-familiar, abstract objects. Further experiments have proposed that the LOC consists of a hierarchical system for shape selectivity indicating greater selective activation in the posterior regions for fragments of objects whereas the anterior regions show greater activation for full or partial objects. This is consistent with previous research that suggests a hierarchical representation in the ventral temporal cortex where primary feature processing occurs in the posterior regions and the integration of these features into a whole and meaningful object occurs in the anterior regions.Ungerleider, L.G., Mishkin, M., 1982. Two cortical visual systems. In: Ingle, D.J., Goodale, M.A., Mansfield, R.J.W. (Eds.), Analysis of Visual Behavior. InMIT Press, Cambridge, pp. 549‚Äì586. = Semantic Processing = Semantic associations allow for faster object recognition. When an object has previously been associated with some sort of semantic meaning, people are more prone to correctly identify the object. Research has shown that semantic associations allow for a much quicker recognition of an object, even when the object is being viewed at varying angles. When objects are viewed at increasingly deviated angles from the traditional plane of view, objects that held learned semantic associations had lower response times compared to objects that did not hold any learned semantic associations. Thus, when object recognition becomes increasingly difficult, semantic associations allow recognition to be much easier. Similarly, a subject can be primed to recognize an object by observing an action that is simply related to the target object. This shows that objects have a set of sensory, motor and semantic associations that allow a person to correctly recognize an object. This supports the claim that the brain utilizes multiple parts when trying to accurately identify an object. Through information provided from neuropsychological patients, dissociation of recognition processing have been identified between structural and semantic processing as structural, colour, and associative information can be selectively impaired. In one PET study, areas found to be involved in associative semantic processing include the left anterior superior/middle temporal gyrus and the left temporal pole comparative to structural and colour information, as well as the right temporal pole comparative to colour decision tasks only. These results indicate that stored perceptual knowledge and semantic knowledge involve separate cortical regions in object recognition as well as indicating that there are hemispheric differences in the temporal regions. Research has also provided evidence which indicates that visual semantic information converges in the fusiform gyri of the inferotemporal lobes. In a study that compared the semantic knowledge of category versus attributes, it was found that they play separate roles in how they contribute to recognition. For categorical comparisons, the lateral regions of the fusiform gyrus were activated by living objects, in comparison to nonliving objects which activated the medial regions. For attribute comparisons, it was found that the right fusiform gyrus was activated by global form, in comparison to local details which activated the left fusiform gyrus. These results suggest that the type of object category determines which region of the fusiform gyrus is activated for processing semantic recognition, whereas the attributes of an object determines the activation in either the left or right fusiform gyrus depending on whether global form or local detail is processed. In addition, it has been proposed that activation in anterior regions of the fusiform gyri indicate successful recognition. However, levels of activation have been found to depend on the semantic relevance of the object. The term semantic relevance here refers to \\"a measure of the contribution of semantic features to the core meaning of a concept.\\" Results showed that objects with high semantic relevance, such as artefacts, created an increase in activation compared to objects with low semantic relevance, such as natural objects. This is due to the proposed increased difficulty to distinguish between natural objects as they have very similar structural properties which makes them harder to identify in comparison to artefacts. Therefore, the easier the object is to identify, the more likely it will be successfully recognized. Another condition that affects successful object recognition performance is that of contextual facilitation. It is thought that during tasks of object recognition, an object is accompanied by a \\"context frame\\", which offers semantic information about the object's typical context. It has been found that when an object is out of context, object recognition performance is hindered with slower response times and greater inaccuracies in comparison to recognition tasks when an object was in an appropriate context. Based on results from a study using fMRI, it has been proposed that there is a \\"context network\\" in the brain for contextually associated objects with activity largely found in the Parahippocampal cortex (PHC) and the Retrosplenial Complex (RSC). Within the PHC, activity in the Parahippocampal Place Area (PPA), has been found to be preferential to scenes rather than objects; however, it has been suggested that activity in the PHC for solitary objects in tasks of contextual facilitation may be due to subsequent thought of the spatial scene in which the object is contextually represented. Further experimenting found that activation was found for both non-spatial and spatial contexts in the PHC, although activation from non-spatial contexts was limited to the anterior PHC and the posterior PHC for spatial contexts.  Recognition memory  When someone sees an object, they know what the object is because they've seen it on a past occasion; this is recognition memory. Not only do abnormalities to the ventral (what) stream of the visual pathway affect our ability to recognize an object but also the way in which an object is presented to us. One notable characteristic of visual recognition memory is its remarkable capacity: even after seeing thousands of images on single trials, humans perform at high accuracy in subsequent memory tests and they remember considerable detail about the images that they have seen  Context  Context allows for a much greater accuracy in object recognition. When an identifiable object is blurred, the accuracy of recognition is much greater when the object is placed in a familiar context. In addition to this, even an unfamiliar context allows for more accurate object recognition compared to the object being shown in isolation. This can be attributed to the fact that objects are typically seen in some setting rather than no setting at all. When the setting the object is in is familiar to the viewer, it becomes much easier to determine what the object is. Though context is not required to correctly recognize, it is part of the association that one makes with a certain object. Context becomes especially important when recognizing faces or emotions. When facial emotions are presented without any context, the ability to which someone is able to accurately describe the emotion being shown is significantly lower than when context is given. This phenomenon remains true across all age groups and cultures, signifying that context is essential in accurately identifying facial emotion for all individuals.  Familiarity  Familiarity is a mechanism that is context-free in the sense that what one recognizes just feels familiar without spending time trying to find in what context one knows the object.Ward, J. (2006). The Student's Guide to Cognitive Neuroscience. New York: Psychology Press The ventro-lateral region of the frontal lobe is involved in memory encoding during incidental learning and then later maintaining and retrieving semantic memories. Familiarity can induce perceptual processes different from those of unfamiliar objects which means that our perception of a finite number of familiar objects is unique. Deviations from typical viewpoints and contexts can affect the efficiency for which an object is recognized most effectively. It was found that not only are familiar objects recognized more efficiently when viewed from a familiar viewpoint opposed to an unfamiliar one, but also this principle applies to novel objects. This deduces to the thought that representations of objects in our brain are organized in more of a familiar fashion of the objects observed in the environment. Recognition is not only largely driven by object shape and/or views but also by dynamic information.Vuong, Q., & Tarr, M. (2004). Rotation direction affects object recognition Familiarity can benefit the perception of dynamic point-light displays, moving objects, the sex of faces, and face recognition. = Recollection = Recollection shares many similarities with familiarity; however, it is context-dependent, requiring specific information from the inquired incident.  Impairments  Loss of object recognition is called visual object agnosia. There are two broad categories of visual object agnosia: apperceptive and associative. When object agnosia occurs from a lesion in the dominant hemisphere, there is often a profound associated language disturbance, including loss of word meaning.  Effects of lesions in the ventral stream  Object recognition is a complex task and involves several different areas of the brain ‚Äì not just one. If one area is damaged then object recognition can be impaired. The main area for object recognition takes place in the temporal lobe. For example, it was found that lesions to the perirhinal cortex in rats causes impairments in object recognition especially with an increase in feature ambiguity. Neonatal aspiration lesions of the amygdaloid complex in monkeys appear to have resulted in a greater object memory loss than early hippocampal lesions. However, in adult monkeys, the object memory impairment is better accounted for by damage to the perirhinal and entorhinal cortex than by damage to the amygdaloid nuclei.Bachevalier, J., Beauregard, M., & Alvarado, M. C. (1999). Long-term effects of neonatal damage to the hippocampal formation and amygdaloid complex on object discrimination and object recognition in rhesus monkeys. Behavioral Neuroscience, 113. Combined amygdalohippocampal (A + H) lesions in rats impaired performance on an object recognition task when the retention intervals were increased beyond 0s and when test stimuli were repeated within a session. Damage to the amygdala or hippocampus does not affect object recognition, whereas A + H damage produces clear deficits. In an object recognition task, the level of discrimination was significantly lower in the electrolytic lesions of globus pallidus (part of the basal ganglia) in rats compared to the Substantia- Innominata/Ventral Pallidum which was in turn worse compared to Control and Medial Septum/Vertical Diagonal Band of Broca groups; however, only globus pallidus did not discriminate between new and familiar objects. These lesions damage the ventral (what) pathway of the visual processing of objects in the brain. = Visual agnosias = Agnosia is a rare occurrence and can be the result of a stroke, dementia, head injury, brain infection, or hereditary.Bauer, R. M. (2006). The agnosias. DC, US: American Psychological Association: Washington Apperceptive agnosia is a deficit in object perception creating an inability to understand the significance of objects. Similarly, associative visual agnosia is the inability to understand the significance of objects; however, this time the deficit is in semantic memory. Both of these agnosias can affect the pathway to object recognition, like Marr's Theory of Vision. More specifically unlike apperceptive agnosia, associative agnosic patients are more successful at drawing, copying, and matching tasks; however, these patients demonstrate that they can perceive but not recognize. Integrative agnosia(a subtype of associative agnosia) is the inability to integrate separate parts to form a whole image. With these types of agnosias there is damage to the ventral (what) stream of the visual processing pathway. Object orientation agnosia is the inability to extract the orientation of an object despite adequate object recognition. With this type of agnosia there is damage to the dorsal (where) stream of the visual processing pathway. This can affect object recognition in terms of familiarity and even more so in unfamiliar objects and viewpoints. A difficulty in recognizing faces can be explained by prosopagnosia. Someone with prosopagnosia cannot identify the face but is still able to perceive age, gender, and emotional expression. The brain region that specifies in facial recognition is the fusiform face area. Prosopagnosia can also be divided into apperceptive and associative subtypes. Recognition of individual chairs, cars, animals can also be impaired; therefore, these object share similar perceptual features with the face that are recognized in the fusiform face area.  Alzheimer's disease  The distinction between category and attribute in semantic representation may inform our ability to assess semantic function in aging and disease states affecting semantic memory, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Because of semantic memory deficits, persons suffering from Alzheimer's disease have difficulties recognizing objects as the semantic memory is known to be used to retrieve information for naming and categorizing objects. In fact, it is highly debated whether the semantic memory deficit in AD reflects the loss of semantic knowledge for particular categories and concepts or the loss of knowledge of perceptual features and attributes.

The school serves girls in three divisions: Lower School (K-4), Middle School (5-8), and Upper School (9-12). History Caroline D. Hewitt founded the Hewitt School in 1920. Hewitt was born in England and educated there. She came to the United States in 1902 as a private tutor to a prominent family of Tuxedo Park, New York. After a decade in that position and at the suggestion of the Hoffman family, Miss Hewitt began private classes for children in a townhouse on the Upper East Side. At this time the school was referred to as Miss Hewitt's Classes. By 1920, Hewitt had established a small kindergarten for boys and girls located at the Mannes Music School. Over time, the school expanded and began to exclusively educate young women. In 1942 Miss Hewitt retired and was succeeded by faculty member Charlotte Comfort. In 1950, the school was granted a charter as a nonprofit corporation. The school moved to its current location at 45 East 75th Street in 1951. In 1955 Miss Hewitt's Classes became The Hewitt School. In 1968, the Gregory Building, named for Board of Trustees president William Gregory, was built. In 1969 Janet Mayer succeeded Miss Comfort as Headmistress and served until her retirement eleven years later. In 1976 the Building Fund Drive added three new stories to the Gregory Building. In 1980 Agathe Crouter succeeded Miss Mayer as Headmistress and served until her retirement in 1990. In 1986 a major renovation of the 75th Street Building was completed, adding classroom space and the John and Elizabeth Hobbs Performing Arts Center. In 1990 Dr. Mary Jane Yurchak became Head of School and then took on a leadership role in integrating academics and technology. In 2000 Linda MacMurray Gibbs became Head of School and initiated a long-term plan for its growth. In 2001 the Hewitt community went online, and a revised course of study based on the curriculum mapping process was initiated. In 2002, with a gift from the McKelvey Foundation, Hewitt purchased another townhouse to accommodate the Lower School, beginning in the Fall of 2003. This building is named McKelvey in honor of trustee Andrew McKelvey. Also in 2003 a major renovation of the library was completed. Ms. Joan Lonergan served as Hewitt's seventh Head of School. Ms. Lonergan assumed this position in July 2010. In her five-year tenure, Ms. Lonergan lead the expansion of the school; the townhouse to the west of the Gregory Building was purchased. Beginning in July 2015, a complete renovation of the buildings was funded and planned under Ms. Lonergan's leadership. In November 2014, The Hewitt School's board president announced that Dr. Tara Christie Kinsey would be the eighth Head of School. Dr. Kinsey's tenure began on July 1, 2015. Academics Hewitt's academic program is modeled around four academic pillars: presence, empathy, research, and purpose. The curriculum is based on liberal arts and the practice of inquiry based learning. The Hewitt School provides STEM education, introducing design challenges in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics classes starting in the lower school, preparing the girls to study robotics in middle school. Other important areas of focus are the foreign language program and foreign exchange program, the creative arts program, which includes both visual and performing arts, and varsity sports teams. Co-curricular Activities * Hewitt annually participates in New York City's Middle School Model Congress. * Hewitt competes in rowing (the only NYC girls' school to have crew), track and field, tennis, soccer, volleyball, squash, basketball, and badminton. * Hawks Robotics team, who regularly qualify for VEX IQ State Championships and have competed in the VEX Robotics Competition World Championships. *Hewitt Middle School Service and Sustainability Committee is dedicated to creating sustainable and ethical practices within the Hewitt community and throughout New York.

John Monroe‚Äôs version of Weasel will make his cinematic debut in James Gunn's upcoming DC Extended Universe film, The Suicide Squad (2021), portrayed by Sean Gunn. Publication history Weasel first appeared in The Fury of Firestorm #35 (August 1985), and was created for DC Comics by Gerry Conway and Rafael Kayanan. Fictional character biographies John Monroe John Monroe was a lonely student at Stanford University in the late 1960s. His contemporaries rarely noticed him. If they did, they referred to him in derogatory terms, using words like \\"Weasel\\" to describe him. This made him bitter, driving him to become a murderer decades later. The grown Jack Monroe became a teacher at Vandemeer University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. A number of his fellow students from Stanford University held prominent positions. To rationalize killing three of them, he considered them threats to getting tenure at Vandemeer. Taking on the costumed identity of Weasel, displaying great agility, expertise at hand-to- hand combat, and a costume with sharp claws, he stalked the campus grounds and brutally murdered Arnold Lintel, Linda Walters, and a night guard named Chuck Gherkin. When Martin Stein (one half of Firestorm) shows up for a job opening as a physics professor, Monroe made two attempts on Martin Stein's life. In the second attempt, he would've killed Martin had he not provoked the transformation of Stein into Firestorm. After a fight, Firestorm unmasked Weasel and sent him to jail.The Fury of Firestorm #35. DC Comics. Weasel was later recruited into the Suicide Squad for their ill-fated mission to rescue Hawk. During the mission, he tried to kill the Thinker by cutting Thinker's throat with his claws. Rick Flag Jr. took the Thinker's helmet to regain control over the mission. When he saw the Weasel, the Thinker's helmet told Flag to kill him. Weasel's death was not mourned.Doom Patrol and Suicide Squad Special #1. DC Comics. During the Blackest Night storyline, Weasel's dead body was seen to be among those entombed in the Hall of Justice. When the Black Power Rings flew in, Weasel's body was among the dead bodies that were reanimated by the Black Power Rings and inducted into the Black Lantern Corps.Blackest Night #3. DC Comics. In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, a slightly revised Jack Monroe Weasel is re-established in the Forever Evil storyline, depicted in a more animalistic state. He was lurking in Central Park when Steve Trevor and Killer Frost were looking for Cheetah (who was in possession of Wonder Woman's lasso). Weasel ambushed Steve Trevor and Killer Frost where he was frozen by a reluctant Killer Frost. Killer Frost told Steve Trevor that Weasel is considered a joke compared to villains Black Bison and Multiplex. Before Steve Trevor and Killer Frost press on, Killer Frost apologizes to Weasel.Forever Evil: A.R.G.U.S. #5. DC Comics.

The raised bog stretches from Torfhaus, a hamlet belonging to the Clausthal-Zellerfeld municipality, to the Brocken massif in the east. The historic peat cutting area today is part of the Harz National Park and can be reached via the scenic trail Goethe Way. From its source, the mountain stream flows northwards through the Radau valley that it has carved out and feeds the high waterfall Radauwasserfall south of Bad Harzburg, immediately next to the Bundesstra√üe 4 federal highway. The artificial waterfall was constructed as a tourist attraction in 1859 on behalf of the Duchy of Brunswick State Railway company, which had operated the Brunswick‚ÄìBad Harzburg railway line since 1841. Beneath the waterfall is a restaurant and a miniature railway integrated into the landscape. Passing west of the Gro√üer Burgberg mountain, the river flows through the Bad Harzburg and Vienenburg urban areas. The Radau discharges into the Oker river northeast of Vienenburg, near the village of Wiedelah at the eastern rim of the Harly Forest.

Although the film was promoted as a rip-off of James Cameron's The Terminator, it is primarily a rip-off of James Cameron's Aliens. It was released in some countries as Terminator II, as it had been made two years before Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Background Despite the film's original title and artwork presenting it as a sequel to 1984 film The Terminator, it is not officially associated with that film. The plot has more in common with the 1986 film Aliens. Two years after Mattei's film came out, Terminator 2: Judgment Day (the official Terminator sequel) was released. Mattei's film was not released in the United States, especially under its original title due to licensing problems.

It is found in shallow peaty calcareous lakes, ponds and ditches, commonly associated with lowland fens. Description Fen pondweed grows from perennial, creeping rhizomes. The leaves are broad, thin and translucent with noticeable reticulate veining. Both floating and submerged leaves are produced but the difference between these is often rather indistinct, rather than the marked dimorphism seen in other pondweeds. Often, the leaves of fen pondweed are simply longer and narrower lower down the stem and shorter and rounder towards its apex; the leaves towards the apex of the stem may be floating but often grow just below the surface, giving the plant a distinctive 'drowned' appearance, as though water levels have recently risen. Submerged leaves are 70‚Äì175 mm long and 10‚Äì30 mm wide. All leaves have the stalk shorter than the blade, and the submerged leaves are almost sessile. The leaves are typically reddish to brownish in colour. Flowers are produced in June to July. Like all pondweeds, they are small and greenish, in spikes up to 45 mm long. The fruits of this species are smaller (1.5-1.9 mm long x 1.0-1.3 mm wide) than Broad- leaved pondweed Potamogeton natans and Bog Pondweed Potamogeton polygonifolius. Turions are not produced. Fen pondweed could be confused with other pondweeds, especially bog pondweed P. polygonifolius, to which it is closely related. However, bog pondweed produces completely opaque floating leaves that are very distinct from the submerged leaves; the submerged leaves are longer and die back relatively early in the season. Bog pondweed also lacks the distinctive net-veined appearance. Potamogeton lucens has leaves with a similar net-veined appearance, but is more uniform in its growth habit, has denticulate (finely toothed) leaf margins and stipules with two conspicuous keels. Potamogeton coloratus is diploid, with 2n=28. Hybrids have been described with P. berchtoldii (P. √ó lanceolatus Sm.) and P. gramineus (P. √ó billupsii Fryer), but both are rare. Taxonomy Fen pondweed was first named by the Danish botanist Jens Wilken Hornemann (1770‚Äì1841). The specific epithet means 'coloured', 'dark', or 'tanned'. As this is a fairly distinctive and not very variable species, there are relatively few synonyms. Distribution Potamogeton coloratus is restricted to Europe (Britain, Ireland, Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden (Gotland only), France including Corsica, Italy including Sardinia and Sicily, Switzerland, Austria, Hungary, Spain (Balearic Islands) and Portugal), Turkey and extreme North Africa (Morocco, Algeria). Ecology and Conservation Fen pondweed has rather specialised habitat preferences, occurring predominantly on deep peat with nutrient-poor calcareous water and a strong groundwater influence, such as is commonly found in alkaline fenlands. Within this habitat it occurs predominantly in ponds, ditches and drains, flushes and seeps, and the margins of shallow lakes, in water up to about 1 m deep, often in the company of stoneworts and bladderworts. In central Europe, it forms a distinct community with Chara hispida and the aquatic form of Juncus subnodulosus in oligotrophic, calcium-rich, spring-fed streams and oxbow lakes. It will also grow on marl, sand and clay. In Britain and central Europe it has been lost from many sites due to eutrophication or drainage, and most remaining populations are in nature reserves. However, where it is found it can be abundant, such as on the Anglesey Fens in North Wales. Fen pondweed remains widespread in Ireland. A study of the genetic diversity of fen pondweed in the managed ditch systems of the Gordano Valley in southwest England showed that genetic diversity increased with distance from the head of the valley. This was interpreted as reflecting population bottlenecks caused by ditch cleaning, and the tendency for dispersal to occur downstream. Pond snails such as Lymnaea stagnalis may consume fen pondweed, but it is rather unpalatable compared to other aquatic plants. Globally and in Britain, fen pondweed is considered Least Concern. However, it is a protected feature of several fenland nature reserves in Britain, both in its own right and as a characteristic species of fenland habitat and the Habitats Directive habitats \\"Hard oligotrophic lakes with Chara\\" and \\"Natural eutrophic lakes with Magnopotamion\\". Effective conservation of this species depends upon protection of its lowland calcareous fenland habitat. Fen pondweed was formerly extinct in the Czech Republic, but has recently been reestablished from the seed bank following desilting of some of its former habitat. It is considered Endangered in Germany and Switzerland, Vulnerable in the Netherlands and is Near Threatened in Sweden. It is protected in several French administrative regions. Cultivation Fen pondweed is not in cultivation, and does not seem particularly easy to grow, reflecting its specialist habitat requirements. It would probably need to be grown in a rather deep, peaty but alkaline substrate.

The music written by former Styx member Dennis DeYoung, who also co-wrote the lyrics with the musical's book author B. T. McNicholl. Based on the 1956 children's novel The Hundred and One Dalmatians written by Dodie Smith, the musical follows a pair of Dalmatian dogs as they search through London in search of their litter of fifteen puppies, which were stolen by Cruella DeVil to make dog skin fur coats. The musical features Rachel York as the infamous Cruella DeVil, and has actors sharing the stage with fifteen real Dalmatians and using stilts to simulate the novel's original canine perspective. The musical was praised by critics for the cast performances, particularly York, and the innovative use of stilts and live dogs. While the plot was generally praised, several reviews noted that the plot suffered from filler and excessive scenes. Reviewers also generally found the music to be fun but forgettable. Plot In London in 1957, a pair of Dalmatian dogs, Pongo and Missus, live with their human owners, the Dearlys, and enjoy a happy life. One day Missus gives birth to eight puppies, and the family is visited by Cruella De Vil, a former classmate of Mrs. Dearly. Cruella tries to buy the litter, but Pongo and Missus' owners refuse to sell them. She hires two men, Jasper and Jinx, to kidnap the puppies, along with many other Dalmatians in the city, to make dog-skinned fur coats. Pongo and Missus run away from home to find their puppies. With help from other dogs across the country, they find them, along with many other puppies, at Cruella's mansion and must get them back home without getting caught by the pursuing Cruella and her henchmen.

He asked director Jerry Zaks to direct, and the creative team went to Mexico to do a workshop production. B. T. McNicholl wrote the libretto based on the novel, and worked together with Dennis DeYoung, formerly of the band Styx, to craft the lyrics for the production. DeYoung acted as the primary composer for the production. In writing the songs, DeYoung notes that after reading the original novel and viewing all of the adaptations, he felt it was a children's work and that it was his \\"responsibility to write at least a couple of songs that kids would like to sing once they leave the theater.\\" He used different themes for each character type, aiming to write \\"more traditional Broadway songs\\" for the humans, while using pop tunes for the dogs. The choreographey is by Warren Carlyle. In addition to having humans playing the primarily canine characters, 15 actual Dalmatian dogs are featured in the production, trained and handled by Joel Slaven. The dogs are a mix of show dogs and ones adopted from various rescue groups around the country. After the production has finished its run, the dogs will be put up for adoption. To achieve the novel's telling of the story from the canine perspective, actors portraying human characters were set on 15-inch stilts so that they would be taller than the canine characters, and the puppies are played by child actors. Rachel York was cast as the infamous Cruella DeVil. After a workshop in Mexico, The 101 Dalmatians Musical made its worldwide debut in October 2009 at the Orpheum Theatre in Minneapolis. As of 2010, it is on a nationwide tour. On January 31, 2010, Rachel York announced on her blog that she had stepped down from the role of Cruella DeVil to pursue other projects, and that the role would be taken over by Sara Gettelfinger. The tour was originally scheduled to run through June 2010, however on March 19, 2010, the production company announced that the tour would end on April 18, 2010, when it concludes its engagement at Madison Square Garden. Reception Lawson Taitte of the Dallas Morning News considered it \\"grand entertainment - and a pretty good musical\\", and felt the use of Dalmatian colored costumes, without dog features, and the use of stilts for the human characters, worked well. While he felt none of the music was memorable, he did find it fun. He particularly praised York's performance as Cruella, calling it an \\"over-the-top (but tasteful!) tour de force\\" with powerhouse vocals and sex appeal\\", and felt the kids were \\"cuter\\" than the live Dalmatians in the musical. The Detroit Newss Eric Henrickson called it a \\"heartfelt family musical\\" and a \\"fun introduction to the live stage for young audiences\\" that had the kids in the audience...dancing in their seats\\" which he felt made the show \\"success[ful] on its most important level.\\". He praised the introductory tune was \\"colorful\\" and \\"tuneful\\", and the musical's actors for their performances. In particular, he highlights York as a \\"divinely wicked Cruella\\" who is \\"the best part of the show\\" and Ludwig as a charming Pongo who was \\"underutilized\\". Henrickson criticized the performance for getting \\"bogged down in staged bits\\", particularly the song for Jasper and Jinx and the addition of filler to the story, and for the \\"disjointed hodgepodge\\" of musical numbers that do not \\"fit well together or with the setting\\" and found some of the choreography \\"more show choir than showstopper.\\" Sandy MacDonald of Theater Mania called it \\"highly enjoyable\\" and found the use of the stilts to be \\"cleaver\\". Cautioning against allowing young children to watch the production due to Cruella's goals, she praises York's performance, stating that she \\"maximiz[es] her magnificent voice and captur[es] every sadistic quirk and sneer of one of the scariest villainesses ever created\\". She also praised the child actors for being both \\"natural and engaging\\", the performances of Ludwig and Ojeda as Pongo and Missus, respectively. Donald V. Calamia of the Encore Michigan thought the musical successfully grabbed and held kids' attention. Calling it a \\"slick and gorgeously designed production\\", he also praised York as \\"delightfully and deliciously evil\\" who manages to avoid scaring children in the audience by using various \\"layers of humor\\". He found Maguire a \\"scene-stealer\\" and felt Foldesi's Perdita \\"[gave] the show heart\\", but also noted that the show may have trouble succeeding on Broadway due to the lack of the \\"'wow'factor\\" and moments common for the Disney-style productions the audience may be expecting. He also felt the actors, beyond York, were unable to \\"take his or her character to that same level of perfection or intensity\\" as one would expect from such a production. BroadwayWorld.com's Jerry Ellis found it \\"pleasantly diverting, tuneful and fun to watch\\" and an \\"expensive and imaginative production\\", though he notes that the actors in human roles seemed to struggle with their balance on the stilts and could have been executed better. He also felt the story was \\"meandering and unfocused at times\\", but considered the choreography to be \\"well-conceived and, for the most part, wonderfully performed\\". He highly praised the performances of the supporting cast. In reviewing the Madison Square Garden performance, David Rooney of The New York Times panned the production, calling it a \\"mirthless, low-concept pantomime\\" and feeling that Gettelfinger's performance as Cruela DeVil was a \\"watered-down facsimile of a classic villainess.\\" He felt the Dalmatian costumes were substandard and lacking in innovation and that the actors on stilts seemed to be constantly trying to maintain their balance. In discussing DeYoung's lyrics, he considered them \\"late-‚Äô70s-style power ballads\\" that lacked \\"emotional connection [and] suspense\\" and did not add anything to the story's narrative.

He served as President of the Maryland Senate from 1951‚Äì1955 and again from 1959-1963. Following his retirement in 1963, Della worked as a lobbyist for Baltimore Gas and Electric. His son, George W. Della, Jr., was a member of the Baltimore City Council from 1976‚Äì1983 and the Maryland Senate representing South Baltimore from 1983-2010. Biography George W. Della was born February 9, 1908, in Baltimore, Maryland. He attained his education locally, attending Baltimore Public Schools and the Baltimore City College, from which he graduated in 1927. He went on to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree in Business Administration from the University of Baltimore in 1932 and, three years later, earned a law degree from that institution's School of Law. By 1936, Della had passed the Maryland Bar and begun to practice law, and the same year he was wed to Agnes H. Mattare, with whom he would have three children, George, Mary, and Howard. As a lifelong resident of Baltimore, Della was active in a number of community organizations. He was a member of Baltimore's Episcopal Church of the Advent and of the Baltimore Country Club, and as a Director of the American Bankers Life Insurance Company of Florida and the South Baltimore General Hospital. Della was also a long-time member of the Freemasons. In 1959 the Boumi Temple of the Shrine, part of the Freemason organization commonly referred to as the Shriners, made him potentate. In 1939, Governor Herbert R. O'Conor appointed Della to the Maryland Senate as the Senator from Baltimore's 6th district. He served in a variety of leadership roles, including as Chair of the Insurance and Loans Committee and the Judicial Proceedings Committee. Della was elected to serve as President of the Maryland Senate in 1951, and would continue in that role until 1955. In 1959, he was again elected President, a position which he would not relinquish again until his retirement in 1963. Following his retirement, Della was hired as a lobbyist in 1967 by the Baltimore Gas and Electric Company, now Constellation Energy. He would continue to play a role in Maryland politics, most prominently as a delegate to the state constitutional convention in 1967. Della retired in 1985, and died in 1990. His son George W.

The character was created by writer/artist George P√©rez. Fictional character biography Amazon origin 3,000 years ago a select few of the Olympian gods, which included Artemis, Athena, Hestia, Demeter and Aphrodite, took the souls of women slain throughout time by the hands of men and sent them to the bottom of the Aegean Sea. The souls then began to form bodies with the clay on the sea bed. Once they reached the surface the clay bodies became living flesh and blood Amazons. Philippus was one of these new race of women. The first to break surface was Hippolyta and thus she was titled as Queen of the new race. The second Amazon to break surface was Hippolyta's sister Antiope and she ruled as a second to Hippolyta in all affairs. Each of the goddesses that created the Amazons blessed them with personalized gifts: hunting skills (Artemis), wisdom (Athena), warm homes (Hestia), plentiful harvests (Demeter), and beauty inside and out (Aphrodite). The Amazons eventually founded the city of Themyscira in Anatolia and became known as fierce warriors of peace in Turkey, Greece, and Rome.Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #1 (February 1987) Downfall The jealous and vengeful god Ares soon after tried to discredit the Amazon's name by having his half-brother demi-god Heracles invade the Amazons and demean their standing by stealing Hippolyta's symbol of power: the Golden Girdle of Gaea. When Heracles first approached the Amazons seeking battle, Hippolyta met him outside the city gates and tried to reason with him for peaceful negotiations. When this did not work Heracles attacked the Amazon Queen using his strength to his advantage. Hippolyta easily turned the tables on him by using her wisdom and battle skills to subdue him. Still wishing peace, Hippolyta invited Heracles and his men into their city to celebrate a potential friendship with a feast. Hiding his anger, Heracles accepted the invitation. Once in their stronghold, Heracles and his men drugged the wine the Amazons were drinking and took them prisoner. After the theft of Hippolyta's Golden Girdle and abuse and rape of the Amazons, Hippolyta cried out to Athena to help them escape their bonds. Athena said that she would only aid them on the condition that the Amazons not seek retribution against Heracles and his men as that would be beneath the ideals the Amazons were created to stand for. Hippolyta hastily agreed and the Amazon's bonds were broken and the drugs given wore off. Once out of their drugged state the Amazons were filled with hate and revenge. Breaking Hippolyta's oath to Athena, the Amazons began slaughtering their captors but were upset to find that Heracles and his general Theseus had returned to their homelands. Philippus was especially affected by the abuse as she no longer truly trusted the male species since. After the slaughter Athena reprimanded the Amazons for disobeying her orders. She demanded the Amazons serve penance for their actions. Though Hippolyta agreed to the goddess' wishes, her sister Antiope scoffed at Athena for being angered at them for killing their rapist captors. Antiope then denounced all ties to the Olympian gods and said goodbye to her sister Hippolyta, giving Hippolyta her Golden Girdle of Gaea to replace the one stolen by Heracles. She left for Greece, along with half of the Amazon Nation who supported Antiope in her new quest to battle Heracles and Theseus out of vengeance and to replace Antiope's girdle with Hippolyta's. Antiope's tribe later became the Amazons of Bana-Mighdall.Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #33 (August 1989) Godly penance Philippus and the remaining faithful Amazons then went to the sea shore where the Olympian Gods told them their punishment for going against their ideals. They were to be given immortality so that they would forever safeguard a doorway to the underworld called Doom's Doorway. Not only must they protect anyone from entering, but they must also vanquish any evils that try to escape. The doorway was on a far-off isolated island and it would take some time to get there. To guide their way, the god Poseidon cleared a pathway for them across the seas. Once they arrived at the island the Amazons created a new city and named their new home Themyscira, after their previous fallen city. This way of life continued for 3,000 years. After the Captain of the Guard named Egeria was killed while stopping a monster from escaping from Doom's Doorway, Philippus was promoted to the rank of Captain in her place. Philippus took the job very seriously and later became General of Hippolyta's armies. Though Philippus has always respected and revered her Queen, over time Philippus' feelings for Hippolyta grew into love.Wonder Woman: Our Worlds at War #1 (September 2001) Whether that love became physical at all over the 3,000 years on the island has never been revealed. Life on the island During the 1940s while guarding Doom's Doorway yet another creature attempted to escape. Unbeknowest to the island's citizens an American woman named Diana Rockwell Trevor crash landed on the island. While exploring the island she discovered the Amazons battling the creature. She used her hand gun to temporarily stop the monster from killing Philippus. The creature was able to kill Diana though but her distraction allowed the Amazons to finally defeat the creature and seal the doorway again. The Amazons held the stranger in high regard once things settled. Philippus particularly felt indebted to Diana and later learned how to use the hand gun. Philippus was constantly at odds with Hippolyta's personal bodyguards known as The Circle: Alkyone, Myrto, Charis, and Philomela. While Hippolyta saw their devotion as endearing, Philippus saw through their insanity and gave them little respect. They in turn showed the same hostility toward Philippus. When Hippolyta was given her daughter Diana as a gift from the gods Philippus openly loved the new Princess as did most of the Amazons on the island. She could see though that the child's presence greatly disturbed the Queen's bodyguards and took it upon herself to watch them at all times. When Philippus suspected Alkyone was going to kill Diana while Hippolyta slept, she attempted to stop them beforehand but was overwhelmed by them instead. When she regained her physical composure Philippus called for the royal guard and had them imprison Hippolyta's bodyguards forever. Diana Philippus took an active role in the raising of the Princess. Over the years she helped Hippolyta teach Diana the ways of the Amazons. When Diana grew to an age where she used her gods given powers too off-handedly it was Philippus who went to Hippolyta to ask if she could teach Diana the lesson of humility. She arranged for a series of physical tests for Diana. In one situation she had a group of masked Amazons ambush Diana. When Diana used her powers to defeat the attackers soundly instead of more gently disable them Philippus had Diana remove the masks from the unconscious victims. Diana was horrified to discover that the attackers were in fact Diana's most cherished Amazon \\"mothers\\". Philippus then arranged for a large boulder to roll toward a group of unaware Amazons. When Diana went to hold back the boulder with her strength Philippus shot Diana in the leg with an arrow. Both these situations taught Diana to use her mind instead of her fists when confronted with a dilemma. In the 1980s Steve Trevor, the son of Diana Rockwell Trevor, crash landed on Themyscira. Resentful at the presence of a man on the island due to her previous rape and slavery at the hands of Herakles' men thousands of years prior, Philippus was openly vocal about wanting Steve killed. Hippolyta felt otherwise and called for a Contest to have the most skilled Amazon escort the man back to his homeland. A disguised Diana became the Contest winner, which caused heartache to both Hippolyta and Philippus. As the last trial of the Contest, Philippus used Diana Rockwell Trevor's hand gun on Princess Diana to see if she was skilled enough to deflect the bullets. The Princess was able to deflect each one and went into Man's World with Steve. Diana returned to the island on several occasions. During one visit the Olympian god Zeus attempted to rape Diana.Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #10 (November 1987) When Hippolyta defied the Olympian Philippus advised the Queen not to put the rest of the island at risk. For defying the gods Diana was ordered to go into Doom's Doorway to defeat the creatures there on her way to an ultimate truth. Even though no one was allowed to aid Diana on this mission Hippolyta defied the gods again and attempted to enter behind her. With tears in her eyes Philippus begged Hippolyta not to enter. Hippolyta refused causing Philippus to tell her that her heart was breaking as she felt obligated to stop her even though she felt anguish in battling someone she loved so dearly. Hippolyta defeated Philippus and aided Diana on her mission anyway. The two later forgave each other. Changes Hippolyta declared that Princess Diana was to act as Themyscira's Ambassador. Because of Diana's actions with the outside world Hippolyta also decided to open their borders to outsiders as a gesture of peace. Philippus and several other Amazons escorted Hippolyta to the U.S. for a promotional tour. The witch Circe arranged for the Amazons of Bana-Mighdall to ambush the Themyscirian Amazons and sabotage their mission by creating chaos in their name. The plan worked and Philippus was seriously injured. Seen as a dangerous terrorist, Philippus was hospitalized under strict armed guard. Diana as Wonder Woman was able to clear things up but the event left a scar on the trust the Amazons had offered the outside world. The Amazons eventually returned to a life of isolation on Themyscira. Some time later the Amazons of Bana-Mighdall were magically transported to Themyscira by the witch Circe. Once there the Egyptian Amazons attacked the Themyscirian Amazons in order to claim the island as their own. During the battle Circe double-crossed the Banas and sent the entire island of Themyscira into a demon dimension along with both tribes of Amazons. The two tribes put aside their rivalry in order to defend themselves against the demons. Once the island was returned to its original setting the Bana Amazons were given a small portion of the island to dwell while the remaining Themyscirian Amazons lived in the city walls. Hippolyta received visions during this period that Wonder Woman would die. Because of this she had Philippus arrange for a new contest for the title of Wonder Woman. Philippus was instructed to place deadfalls along the contest route in order to slow down Diana so that others might have a chance at winning. Philippus was appalled at Hippolyta's wishes but followed her Queen's orders. Because of these actions the Bana Amazon Artemis won the title to be the new Wonder Woman. Diana had a huge falling out with her mother and left the island in anger. Because of this Hippolyta fell into depression and went mildly insane. Philippus took a more active role in overseeing the island because of this. Later, when Hippolyta discovered her plotting caused the death of Artemis her shame grew to the point where she felt she couldn't lead her people anymore. Hippolyta officially gave rule of Themyscira over to Philippus and banished herself in a small one person-sized boat. Philippus took her rule seriously but later admitted to Diana that she was more comfortable guiding the Amazon armies at war time than she did the day-to-day rule of an entire nation. When Diana refused to take over rule of the island Philippus reluctantly continued to serve as regent Queen. Chancellor Philippus Hippolyta eventually returned to Themyscira and took back her crown. Civil war then broke out between both island tribes due to the fluctuating rule and growing tensions. In order to end the war Diana and Hippolyta denounced their crowns and gave over the island to Philippus and a resurrected Artemis to act as co-rulers. Philippus was given the title of Chancellor and Archon Eponymous, whereas Artemis was given the title of Polemarch.Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #177 (February 2002)Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #208 (November 2004) It is explained that Archon Eponymous equates to the Civic Office of a Presidential title, whereas the position of Polemarch translates to War Leader, similar to the position of Commander-In-Chief. During their official rule they opened the island to outworlders, both on Earth and alien worlds. When the alien being Imperiex invaded Earth during the Our Worlds at War storyline the Amazons joined in the battle which led to Hippolyta's death. This devastated Philippus who took greater ferocity in ending the battle. It was here that Philippus admitted her feelings for Hippolyta. Diana stayed on as the island's Ambassador. Because of the Goddess Hera a large tsunami was close to landing on America's shores. It was stopped by Wonder Woman but the event caused the U.S. to suspect the Amazons to have ill will towards them. The U.S. President, Jonathan Vincent Horne, had Naval battleships position themselves around Themyscira in defense. Wishing to ease tensions, Philippus, Artemis and Diana met with the U.S. President. He agreed to remove the battleships if the Amazons agreed to transfer blue prints on how to create their own Purple Ray. Believing the U.S. would use the Purple Ray as a weapon, the Amazons gave a firm \\"no\\" in response. Because of this political tensions remained between the two nations. Through the machinations of an A.I. satellite called Brother Eye, a military strike was made against Themyscira in an attempt at Amazon genocide. A large swarm of OMAC units were sent to the island and began to attack the Amazons as part of the events of Infinite Crisis.Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #223 (January 2006) Because of this, as well as the many previous attacks against the island since Diana had become Wonder Woman, it was decided by Philippus and Artemis that the entire island of Themyscira and all of its inhabitants (sans Diana) would be transported to a hidden dimension via the Olympian and Bana-Mighdallian goddesses.Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #224 (February 2006) Philippus and the remaining Amazons thrive in this dimension for a year's time in peace.Wonder Woman (vol. 3) #7 (June 2007) Amazons Attack The witch Circe later entered the Amazons' protected dimension and revived Queen Hippolyta from death.Wonder Woman (vol. 3) #8 (June 2007) Circe informed the Amazons that Diana was being illegally detained by the U.S. government and tortured until she gave them the secrets of the Purple Ray. Because of this, the Amazons agreed to give Hippolyta her royal title back, and followed her instructions to invade Washington, D.C. which brought about the events of Amazons Attack. Artemis and Philippus were assigned to oversee the battle, but soon lost faith in Hippolyta when they discovered some of her actions against Man's World proved to be less honorable. Due to their failure to follow-through in stopping Hippolyta during the war, a disguised Granny Goodness cursed all of the Amazons by erasing their memories and scattering them across the globe with false personas.Wonder Woman (vol. 3) #11 (September 2007) With the return of the Olympian gods, Zeus revives the Amazon's memories several months after their memory wipes and has them return to Themyscira.Wonder Woman (vol. 3) #27 (February 2009) With the creation of the Gargareans, Zeus had these new male Amazons live on both the island of Thalarion and Themyscira. Their leader Achilles was given rule over both his people and the original Amazons. To add insult to injury Achilles chose Philippus' old rival Alkyone to become his Queen. This infuriated Philippus who continued to refer to Hippolyta as her Queen. Once the Amazon Artemis returned to the island she helped to organize a coup against the mad Queen Alkyone. Joined by Achilles and his people, the coup was successful and Hippolyta was re-crowned as Queen of the Amazons. Rebirth After the events of DC Rebirth, Philippus returned as a prominent Amazon in Diana's life.Wonder Woman #2 (September 2016) As the General of the Amazons, Philippus was charged with training Diana in battle. She also became romantically involved with Queen Hippolyta. (though it's not confirmed whether she's a lesbian or bisexual)Wonder Woman #4 (October 2016) Powers and abilities Philippus has 3,000 years of combat experience providing her expertise in both hand-to-hand combat as well as with hand-held weapons. As a Themyscirian Amazon she also possesses immortality that allows her to live indefinitely in a youthful form, but does leave her open to potential injury and death depending on her actions. Philippus, as a Themyscirian, also possesses enhanced strength and intelligence. As shown by fellow members of her tribe, she has the capability to break apart steel and concrete with her bare hands,Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #59 (October 1991) jump over 12 feet from a standing position,Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #57 (August 1991) has a high durability factor, enhanced healing,Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #30 (May 1989) and the ability to absorb and process a vast amount of knowledge in a short period of time.Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #3 (April 1987) Philippus, in addition to all the Themyscirian Amazons, also possesses the ability to relieve her body of physical injury and toxins by becoming one with the Earth's soil and then reforming her body whole again. The first time Diana does this she prays to her god Gaea saying: \\"Gaea, I pray to you. Grant me your strength. You are the Earth who suckled me, who nurtured and bred me. Through you all life is renewed. The circle which never ends. I pray you, mother Gaea, take me into your bosom. Please, let me be worthy.\\" During writer John Byrne's time on the comic it was stated that this is a very sacred ritual to the Themyscirians, only to be used in the most dire of circumstances.Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #120 (April 1997) Other versions Odyssey In the alternate timeline of Odyssey, Philippus was one of the few surviving Amazons that protected Wonder Woman. She was later killed by the centaur Cernunnos during battle. Flashpoint In the alternate timeline of the Flashpoint event, Philippus is protector of Wonder Woman. Later, she mistakenly killed Garth, who had been himself framed by Artemis for the murder of Queen Hippolyta.Flashpoint: Wonder Woman and the Furies #1 (June 2011) Later, Philippus is found killed by the Atlanteans, before Artemis has bombs dropped on Themyscira.Flashpoint: Wonder Woman and the Furies #2 (July 2011) The Legend of Wonder Woman Philippus appears in this alternate re-telling of Wonder Woman's origins.The Legend of Wonder Woman #2 Injustice: Gods Among Us Philippus appears in the comic series based on the Injustice 2 video game. She's also a former lover of Menalippe.Injustice 2 #29 (2017) In other media Film * In the 2017 films Wonder Woman and Justice League, Philippus is played by Ann Ogbomo. Television * Philippus, or Phillipus as she is named in the credits, appeared twice as a minor character in the Justice League TV series.

History Old Bryn Hall The Ashton in Makerfield seat of the Gerard family was Bryn Hall, in their estate Bryn Park, Ashton in Makerfield. Brynne Hall became the seat of the Gerard family by the marriage of William Gerard to the daughter and sole heiress of Peter de Brynne in 1250. The estate is now used for arable purposes, although part of it has been used for the Landgate housing development. It has been suggested that the site of the Old Hall should be excavated to find the remains of the house; however, the landowner has dug it up. New Bryn New Bryn Hall was built by a different section of the family. It was erected during the reign of Edward VI and was built around a courtyard and entered by crossing a narrow bridge over a moat that surrounded the property. The hall had a gatehouse secured by huge doors. A porch led to the great hall, which had a railed gallery along one side used to observe entertainments below. The gallery was supported by richly carved double pilasters, which were later removed to Garswood Hall. (The original stone footings of this building were no more than 40 feet square, so the 'great' hall wasn't as 'great' as you might imagine) Thomas Gerard was High Sheriff of Lancashire in 1557. His son, Thomas Gerard, was created Baronet Gerard of Bryn in 1611. The Roman Catholic martyr and saint Edmund Arrowsmith was related to the Gerards on his mother's side, and after his execution in 1628 his hand was reportedly cut off and preserved at the Hall in a white silk bag; it was referred to as the 'holy hand'.Old Bryn Hall, Wigan Archaeological Society, retrieved 8 July 2014.Edward Baines, The history of the County Palatine and Duchy of Lancaster, rev. ed. James Croston, Volume 4 Manchester/London: John Heywood, 1891, , p. 381. The Gerards were Royalists during the English Civil War. In 1651, Charles II travelled through Wigan and lodged at Bryn Hall on his way from Scotland to his ultimate defeat at the Battle of Worcester.Ernest Broxap, The Great Civil War in Lancashire, 1642-1651, 2nd ed. Manchester: Manchester University Press / Clifton, New Jersey: A.M. Kelly, 1973, , p. 182. New Bryn Hall had completely collapsed by the end of the 20th century. In the early 1600s the Gerards left Bryn Hall for nearby Garswood Hall before moving into New Hall, which dates to around 1692 and which they obtained from the Launder family; it has since been renamed Garswood Hall. New Bryn was later demolished. Later, another 'Bryn Hall' was built, on a different site some distance from the original, by an offshoot of the Gerard family (Richard Gerard in marriage to Margaret Baldwin). The Crippin family moved into this hall and developed coal mining on the estate. In 1870 20 men were killed and 1873 six men were killed in explosions at Bryn Hall Colliery on the Bryn Hall Estate. Bryn Hall was home to colliery owner Edward Frederick Crippin.

He is able to detect the scent of gunpowder with great accuracy. ; : :His name derives from a Japanese word meaning ‚Äúdying insane,‚Äù and that is probably what he is going to do. He has a fondness for knives, to the point of licking them with his freakishly long tongue. He is deadly at mid-range as a silent killer due to his knife throwing skills and demonstrates them during an infiltration mission. During this mission, he is seen to be enjoying inflicting pain during interrogation and licks his blade clean after the kill. ; : :The final current member of Phantom, Riki is a huge tank-like man and just as fearsome a soldier as his comrades.

At that time her work was in the collection of the California State University and Colleges. The LAMNH show completed a transition from previous work that was in a style of either realism or modernism to work that was often feminist in subject matter and increasingly surrealist in style. Neiman also had a one-woman show at the Brand Museum, integrating details of the physical location with revelations about femininity. Neiman was an early experimenter in the realm of technology- assisted art, with a series based on color Xerox art combining iterations of xerox and prismacolor pencil.

The film centres on a group of students who, while on a field trip, become victims in a snuff film, and stars Danica McKellar, Jay Kenneth Johnson, William Forsythe, Sean Kanan, Juliet Landau, Justin Chon, Travis Schuldt, Adrienne Frantz and Gabrielle Richens. The film was released in the UK on July 20, 2007 before receiving a US release on December 11, 2007. Plot On a small island, a man (Kane Hodder) is chased by an unseen figure. As he stops to catch his breath, he is decapitated by his pursuer. Meanwhile, a group of teenage college students, including the social outcast Emily (Danica McKellar), Emily's love interest Johnny (Jay Kenneth Johnson), the flamboyant homosexual Ricky (Justin Chon), jock Tim (Travis Schuldt), boyish lesbian Maddy (Adrienne Frantz), stoner Q (Won-G) and girly-girl Sylvia (Gabrielle Richens), are chosen to go on a field trip to a small island. The group, along with their teacher Mr. Argento (Mike Wittlin), meet Captain J.T. Bates (Burt Young) who takes them to the island on his boat. Here, the group meet the eccentric couple Vincent King (Sean Kanan) and Mary Shelley (Juliet Landau) who they will be staying with. Mary begins to film the group on her hand-held recorder, saying that she is an aspiring director. At night, while the group settle in and have dinner with Vincent and Mary, Mr. Argento finds he has to leave the island to retrieve some equipment. However arriving at the boat, Mr. Argento finds J.T. has been murdered. Meanwhile, the students have a bonfire on the beach. Q leaves the group only to be startled by a figure dressed up as a clown. When he tells the others the incident is ignored and everyone goes to bed, not knowing Mr. Argento has also been murdered. The following day, Sheriff Stoker (Tony Burton) arrives on the island in search of a missing hunter. He questions Vincent and Mary, but both deny ever seeing him, so the Sheriff leaves. Soon after, Tim and Sylvia sneak into the forest to have sex, but are quickly attacked by the killer who murders Tim with a chainsaw. Sylvia is chased through the forest but is eventually caught, before being locked in a cage in an underground dungeon. At dinner, Emily becomes concerned with the various group disappearances, before she realises the phone lines are down, however Vincent and Mary convince everyone there is nothing to worry about. The students again have a bonfire on the beach, while Q decides to try and search for a phone signal. He encounters the clown once again, who swiftly crushes his neck and kills him. With Q now also missing, Emily, Johnny, Ricky and Maddy enter the forest to find their fellow students. Meanwhile, Vincent and Mary are shown watching videos of various murders they have committed and filmed, revealing the couple are making a snuff film. Sheriff Stoker, having become suspicious about Vincent and Mary returns to the island, however he is quickly murdered by the couple with an axe. Ricky and Maddy search the forest, but Maddy is soon knocked unconscious by Vincent and Mary while Ricky flees. Maddy awakens sometime later tied to a tree where she encounters Willy (William Forsythe) who sets her free and tells her she can escape on his boat. While chasing Ricky through the forest, Vincent and Mary stop to record some footage. Vincent bites a chunk out of Mary's neck which eventually kills her, before Ricky attacks Vincent but is ultimately shot dead himself. As Johnny and Emily search the forest, Johnny finally kisses her. Overhearing Ricky's death, Johnny leaves to investigate. Meanwhile, Maddy searches for Willy's boat, but instead finds Emily standing next to a water well. Maddy warns Emily about the murders, but Emily unexpectedly pushes Maddy down the well where she is impaled on a spike. Vincent emerges from a nearby tree, congratulating Emily for her performance and luring the students to the island. Vincent informs Emily that Mary is now dead, and it is revealed the pair were having an affair behind Mary's back. Johnny soon returns to Emily, but is knocked unconscious by Vincent. Johnny awakens in the dungeon and finds Sylvia still trapped in the cage, which is hanging above a pool of piranha fish. Willy arrives and frees Johnny, but Vincent and Emily also arrive and shoot Willy in the chest with an arrow, presumably killing him. In the ensuing fight, Vincent is severely injured and Sylvia is plunged into the pool of piranha. Johnny is chased to the beach where he is caught by Vincent and Emily. However Willy reveals himself to have survived and fatally stabs Vincent, but Emily quickly shoots Willy in the head, killing him. Johnny continues to fight with Emily, before Sylvia also reveals herself to have survived, and she finally kills Emily. Deputy Radley (Lochlyn Munro) then arrives on the island to take Johnny and Sylvia home. In a flashback scene, Deputy Radley is shown to be involved with the snuff film, leaving it unknown if Johnny and Sylvia were saved or were murdered also.
