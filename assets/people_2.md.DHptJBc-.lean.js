He played college football at LSU, and was drafted by the San Francisco 49ers in the fourth round of the 2016 NFL Draft. Early years Robinson was born in Pompano Beach, Florida, where he attended Blanche Ely High School. College career Robinson attended Louisiana State University, where he played two seasons of college football for the LSU Tigers under head coach Les Miles. He recorded one interception and 30 tackles in 15 games. Robinson was suspended indefinitely from LSU's football team midway through the 2014 season due to a failed drug test and substandard academics. After missing a semester, he was arrested in June 2015 for unauthorized entry into a teammate's apartment and was not allowed to re-enroll. He returned to Florida and enrolled at Broward College in Fort Lauderdale, where he began training for the NFL Draft. Professional career Coming out of LSU, Robinson was by the majority of NFL draft experts and scouts to be a fourth or fifth round pick. He received an invitation to the NFL combine and boasted he would run a 4.2 forty-yard dash. Robinson's performance was sub-par and he elected to skip the bench press and wasn't able to complete the short shuttle or three-cone drill after suffering a calf injury. On March 14, 2016, he attended LSU's Pro Day, but held a private workout afterwards due to his tumultuous past with the team. All 32 NFL teams were in attendance as Robinson opted to complete all of the combine and positional drills. He was able to shorten his times in the 40 (4.40), 20 (2.61), and 10-yard dash (1.60) from the combine. Robinson was ranked as the 16th best cornerback prospect in the draft by NFLDraftScout.com. NFL analysts and scouts cited his thin frame, off the field problems, spindly legs, and character concerns were cited as his top issues. Robinson was considered to be one of the top press corners in the draft and was described in scouting reports as a player with a long frame and great man coverage ability. He also has blazing straight line speed and explosiveness. =San Francisco 49ers= 2016 The San Francisco 49ers selected Robinson in the fourth round (133rd overall) of the 2016 NFL Draft. He was one of three cornerbacks the 49ers selected in the 2016 NFL Draft, along with Will Redmond (third round) and Prince Charles Iworah (seventh round).

He competed with Kenneth Acker, Keith Reaser, Dontae Johnson, Marcus Cromartie, Chris Davis, Will Redmond, and Prince Charles Iworah throughout training camp for a role as the backup cornerback. Head coach Chip Kelly named him the fifth cornerback on the depth chart to begin the season, behind Tramaine Brock, Jimmie Ward, Chris Davis, and Dontae Johnson. He made his professional regular season debut during the 49ers' season-opening 28‚Äì0 victory over the Los Angeles Rams. The next game, he made his first career tackle during the 49ers' 27‚Äì46 loss to the Carolina Panthers. On October 2, 2016, Robinson earned the first start of his career in place of Jimmie Ward, who suffered a quad injury during a special teams play the week prior. Robinson made five solo tackles and a season-high three pass deflections in his first start, as the 49ers lost 17‚Äì24 to the Dallas Cowboys. During Week 6 matchup against the Buffalo Bills, he made his third start and tied his season-high of five solo tackles as the 49ers lost 16‚Äì45.

He finished his rookie season with a total of 28 combined tackles (25 solo), 8 pass deflections, and 1 interception in 14 games and 6 starts. 2017 Robinson entered training camp competing for one of the vacant starting cornerback jobs after Jimmie Ward was moved to free safety and Tramaine Brock was released following a domestic violence incident. He competed with Dontae Johnson, Keith Reaser, Ahkello Witherspoon, and K'Waun Williams throughout training camp. Head coach Kyle Shanahan named him the starting cornerback opposite Dontae Johnson to begin the season. Robinson started the 49ers' season-opener against the Carolina Panthers and recorded four combined tackles and recovered a fumble after forcing it from Christian McCaffrey in the fourth quarter in a 3‚Äì23 loss.

It occupies the block bounded by 41st Street, 42nd Street, Lexington Avenue, and Third Avenue. The Socony‚ÄìMobil Building contains a three-story base with a primary entrance on 42nd Street, a secondary entrance on Lexington Avenue, and a basement that is visible along Third Avenue. Above the base is a 42-story tower that brings the structure to its maximum height; this is flanked to the west and east by wings that rise to the 13th story. The stories above the base are completely clad with stainless steel, comprising 7,000 panels. The structure was designed in two sections. The consultant John B. Peterkin designed the original plans to comply with the 1916 Zoning Resolution, while architects Harrison & Abramovitz became involved in 1952 and redesigned the structure in the International and Moderne styles. The Socony‚ÄìMobil Building was constructed between 1954 and 1956 as a speculative development by Peter B. Ruffin, who acquired a long-term lease from the site's owners, the Goelet family. Ruffin persuaded several tenants to move into 150 East 42nd Street, including the Socony‚ÄìMobil oil company, which occupied half the building upon its completion. The Socony‚ÄìMobil Building was renamed the Mobil Building in 1966 and was sold to Hiro Real Estate Company in 1987. After a series of renovations in the 1990s, it was sold to real estate investor David Werner in 2014. The building was designated a New York City landmark in 2003. Architecture The building, designed by prominent New York architects Harrison & Abramovitz in the International and Moderne Styles, is located less than a block east of Grand Central Terminal. It is bounded by 42nd Street to the north, Third Avenue to the east, 41st Street to the south, and Lexington Avenue to the west. The Chrysler Building is located across 42nd Street while the Chanin Building is across Lexington Avenue. The site occupies . = Form = The Socony‚ÄìMobil Building comprises 45 stories in total, with a roof height of . The base is composed of three stories and occupies the whole block; because the topography descends from Lexington Avenue to Third Avenue, the basement story is visible along Third Avenue, making that side four stories tall. The 42-story upper section is centrally located within the block and is flanked by thirteen-story wings to the east and west. The building has capacity for over 8,000 office workers. =Facade= The facade is made of two sections: a base with a tinted-glass facade and an upper section with a metal facade. Both materials are used in Harrison & Abramovitz's other works, as well as other structures in New York City. In addition, the Socony‚ÄìMobil Building includes 3,200 vertically-pivoting single-pane windows. These windows could withstand wind gusts of up to .  Base  subway entrance shown in the middle The base is four stories tall and occupies the entire block. The facade of the base is composed mostly of dark-blue, opaque tinted glass windows, with slightly projecting moldings made of stainless steel; this contrasts with the adjacent buildings, which are primarily clad with terracotta. At 42nd Street and Lexington Avenue, there are large metallic entrance archways at the center of the base. An entrance to the New York City Subway's Grand Central‚Äì42nd Street station (leading to the platform for the ) is located within the building east of the 42nd Street archway. There are ground-floor storefronts at all corners of the building, except at the southwest corner.  Upper section  The facade of the upper 42 stories consists of approximately of thick pleated chromium nickel panels, described as being 20-gauge \\"Type 302\\" stainless steel. There are 7,000 panels, embossed with pyramidal forms in high relief, on the building. These panels can be grouped into four types: singular rosettes vertically adjacent to the windows; pairings of large and small rosettes beside the windows; and two types of interlocking pyramidal forms. The panels were designed so that rain could be washed away easily. To ensure the patterns would be created to the correct specifications, the architects made full-sized plaster models and hired metal- die workers. Harrison & Abramovitz had briefly considered using aluminum, but because of developers Peter B. Ruffin and John W. Galbreath's connections to the steel industry, the architects instead decided to clad the facade in steel. According to architectural historian Christopher Gray, \\"By using steel panels on the 1.6 million square foot [] building, the team gained several inches of floor space on the inside wall, greatly reduced labor costs on the skin, and saved weight‚Äîthe panels weighed two pounds per square foot [] as opposed to 48 pounds per square foot [] for brick\\". It continues to be among the world's largest stainless-steel-clad skyscrapers. =Interior= alt= The structure contains about in total interior space. Stainless steel was used in the lobby and for the elevator doors. The panels were press-formed into a trihedral pattern to prevent waviness and to break up reflections. Near the top of the building are three mechanical floors. History = Site = The site of the Socony‚ÄìMobil Building was initially owned by the Goelet family, namely Robert Goelet Sr. (1809-1879) and Peter Goelet (1800-1879), co-founders of the Chemical Bank. The Goelet brothers began acquiring land on the current Socony‚ÄìMobil Building site in 1848, close to the intersection of Lexington Avenue and 42nd Street on the block's northwest corner, and then leased the land. The largest lessee, furniture-design company Pottier & Stymus, built a six-story brick factory/showroom building on the site that burned down in 1888 and was rebuilt by the Goelets. The block also contained numerous hotels, a garage, and two theaters. An entrance to the New York City Subway's Grand Central‚Äì42nd Street station was built within a structure on 42nd Street after 1915. Pottier & Stymus factory building, which formerly occupied the Socony‚ÄìMobil Building site The completion of the underground Grand Central Terminal in 1913 resulted in the rapid development of the areas around Grand Central, and a corresponding increase in real-estate prices. An elevated railroad line, running above 42nd Street to the Grand Central station, was closed in 1923, leading to the development of such structures as the Chanin Building and 110 East 42nd Street to the west of Lexington Avenue. However, the neighborhood east of Lexington Avenue continued to be made up of mostly low-rise buildings; these blocks were adjacent to the Second Avenue and Third Avenue elevated lines and so these areas were initially considered unattractive for major development. With the 1942 closure and demolition of the Second Avenue line, the Goelets purchased more lots at Third Avenue and 41st Street, accurately foreseeing that the Third Avenue elevated would eventually be closed and the area would be redeveloped. = Planning and construction = Developers John Galbreath and Peter Ruffin convinced the Goelet estate to build an office building on their land at Lexington Avenue and 42nd Street. At the time, structures with metal facades were not common and would not become a trend until the end of World War II. Subsequently, in 1942, the Goelets hired John B. Peterkin as a consultant. Peterkin published his first plan for an office building in the early 1940s. Based on proposals for Rockefeller Center, it called for an office tower over an airport-bus terminal at ground level. The plan did not progress because of doubts over how the large site would be developed, as well as the challenges in securing the long-term leases that the Goelets wanted. The plans were then brought up by Peter B. Ruffin, the CEO of developer John W. Galbreath's Galbreath Corporation, which was headquartered nearby. At the time, the Goelet estate \\"wanted the property improved but not exploited\\". Ruffin and Galbreath hired Harrison & Abramovitz to design the building in 1952. The developers convinced Mobil (at the time known as Socony-Vacuum) to be the anchor tenant, relocating into half of the structure from their previous headquarters at 26 Broadway in Lower Manhattan. Construction of a 42-story skyscraper was officially announced in 1953. The developers decided to call the structure the Socony- Vacuum Building. At the time of the announcement, the site was still occupied by Volk's, a German bar on Third Avenue; the five-story Pershing Square Hotel on 42nd Street; a six-story loft next to the hotel; and numerous one-story structures with stores. After the Mobil deal was finalized, the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States and the National City Bank of New York collectively loaned $37.5 million for the project. In 1953 and 1954, the original plans for a brick-faced structure were changed to that for a structure with embossed steel panels, even though at the time, steel was more expensive than brick. This was because Ruffin and Galbreath had connections to U.S. Steel, which offered to cover the cost difference of steel, and because such a design would show off the potential uses of steel on buildings. Prior to the decision to use steel, Harrison & Abramovitz had briefly considered using aluminum. German architect Oscar Nitzchke, of Harrison & Abramovitz's office, may have been involved in designing the steel panels, though the extent of his involvement is unclear. For the steel panels, over 100 designs were said to have been reviewed. Harrison & Abramovitz hired Turner Construction as general contractors and Edwards & Hjorth as structural engineers. A groundbreaking ceremony for 150 East 42nd Street was held on March 31, 1954. Girder construction started in November 1954 and was completed by the following July. The installation of steel panels then started in May 1955 and completed that December. Though the builders later claimed that \\"no accidents\\" had occurred during construction, there was an incident in August 1955 in which the scaffolding sagged, forcing an evacuation of nearby blocks. = Opening and early years = Viewed from Third Avenue looking southwest; the Chanin Building is in the background to the right The first tenants started moving into the building in April 1956, and the structure was declared finished on October 3, 1956. The opening ceremony occurred two weeks later, on October 17, with a cornerstone-laying ceremony attended by the leaders of several large tenants. These leaders made predictions of \\"scientific commonplaces\\" within the next hundred years, and placed their predictions within the cornerstone. At the time of its completion, the Socony‚ÄìMobil Building was the first skyscraper to have its exterior wall entirely clad with stainless steel, as well as being the largest air-conditioned building in the world. Ruffin, the Socony‚ÄìMobil Building's owner, had been placed in charge of leasing the office space. Though the building was a speculative development, it was successful: The space had been completely leased by February 1955, leading Ruffin to say that it was the first time he had seen a building fully leased \\"before [it] was even near completion\\". Numerous companies had followed Socony‚ÄìMobil's example of moving from Lower Manhattan to Midtown Manhattan, though many corporations were moving to the suburbs at the time. At opening, Mobil had 2,500 employees working on the floors that they occupied. Another early tenant was the building's own contractor, Turner Construction, whose occupancy was described as an \\"ultimate compliment\\" to the Socony‚ÄìMobil Building's design. Other tenants included American Express Company, F. W. Woolworth Company, and First National City Bank at the base, as well as Air Reduction Company, International General Electric Company, American Tobacco Company, Hill & Knowlton, and St. Regis Paper Company on the upper floors. Shortly after the Socony‚ÄìMobil Building's opening, the Pinnacle Club of New York was established near the top stories as a corporate club; it rivaled the Chrysler Building's Cloud Club. = Later use = When the Socony‚ÄìMobil Company became the Mobil Oil Corporation in 1966, its headquarters was renamed the Mobil Building. The structure was the subject of several bomb attacks by the Fuerzas Armadas de Liberaci√≥n Nacional Puertorrique√±a (FALN) in the 1970s. One such attack in 1970 targeted numerous office buildings in the area. Another bomb, in 1977, killed an office worker in the building. At the time of the 1970 attack, The New York Times stated that the Mobil Building was owned by the Connecticut General Life Insurance Company. Because of an increase in crime in the 1980s, as well as the fact that the Mobil Building was largely occupied by a single tenant, a security desk was installed in the lobby, which required that all visitors and employees sign in prior to entering the building. In 1987, the building was sold to the Japanese firm Hiro Real Estate Company in a transaction estimated to be worth $200 million. The building's occupancy rate decreased to 15%, partially because Mobil then relocated elsewhere and partially because of the early 1990s recession, even though neighboring buildings generally had over 80% occupancy. The Socony‚ÄìMobil Building was renovated in 1995, during which it was cleaned for the first time, and the elevators, mechanical systems, lobby, and concierge desk were restored. By that year, occupancy had increased to 25%. Several major tenants, including HypoVereinsbank, Pfizer, Gruner + Jahr, and American Airlines, rented space in the building and brought it to 89% occupancy by 1997. Hiro also extended the ground lease from 2013 to 2028 to show its long-term commitment; previously, companies had hesitated at moving into the building because the short term of the ground lease had indicated an uncertain future for the building. Hiro acquired a long-term lease from the Goelet estate in 2001 and began renovating the structure for $15 million. Around the same time, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission began considering the structure for official landmark status. Lawyers for Hiro objected, saying, \\"We don't believe the case [for landmark status] has been successfully made.\\" In 2003, the Socony‚ÄìMobil Building was designated as an official landmark despite these objections. Hiro placed the building on the market in 2014, and the building was acquired afterward by real estate investor David Werner for $900 million.  Critical reception  The Socony‚ÄìMobil Building's design was met with mixed opinions. A contemporary Architectural Forum article said that much of the controversy revolved around the facade: \\"some dislike it because it reminds them of the metal ceiling of an old store. Others like it because it reminds them of an old store. Some who disliked it to begin with are now pleased with the sparkle. Some like it less now that the building is finished.\\" Architectural critic Lewis Mumford was among the detractors: He described the facade as \\"a disaster\\" and said that \\"From the street, this new building looks as if it were coming down with measles.\\" Similarly, critic Henry Hope Reed Jr. stated that \\"technical triumphs make for nothing but greater ugliness\\", while writer John Tauranac stated that \\"its design is uninspired\\". The building also received praise for its design. A writer for The New York Times stated that \\"the curtain-wall or shell type of construction around skyscrapers has brought the metallic look to the skyline\\". In its 2003 designation report, the Landmarks Preservation Commission described the building as \\"one of New York's most striking skyscrapers\\".

History  St Trygarn's Church is thought to have been built in the 13th century; the former north doorway of the nave, which was reset in the south wall of the chancel, is the only part of the church which dates from that time. The collar beam roof of the chancel and the window settings were put into the church in the Late Medieval period. There are two 18th-century memorials: one in slate to Owen and Elen Morris and three of their descendants, and one in marble to Ellin and John Hughes and two members of their family. Both are set on the internal south wall of the nave. In the 19th century, new windows were installed and the majority of the interior was refitted. Samuel Lewis noted in 1849 that St Trygarn's Church and St Twrog's Church, Bodwrog, shared a priest, who resided in a house in Bodwrog built in 1838 by Jesus College, Oxford, to whom belonged the tithes of the parish.

He played college football at Grand Valley State. Professional career Judon received an invitation to the East‚ÄìWest Shrine Game, but was unable to play after an arthroscopy discovered what was characterized as a \\"tweaked meniscus\\". He was one of sixty-five defensive linemen to receive an invitation to the NFL combine and the first player from Grand Valley State to receive an invite in two years and opted to attend. Judon showed athleticism and strength, finishing top among defensive linemen in the 40-yard dash (fifth), bench press (fifth), and vertical jump (fourth). On March 15, 2016, he participated at Grand Valley State's pro day, along with four other teammates. Team representatives and scouts from 26 NFL teams attended his pro day as Judon ran positional drills and opted to stand on his combine numbers. He had an impressive workout and raised his draft stock, receiving much praise from scouts who attended. Throughout the pre-draft process, Judon had private workouts and meetings with the Carolina Panthers, New England Patriots, Arizona Cardinals, New Orleans Saints, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and Philadelphia Eagles . At the conclusion of the pre-draft process, he was projected to be a fourth round pick by NFL draft experts and scouts. Although he showed a great combination of strength and athleticism, his fourth round grade was mainly due to teams being skeptical over his ability to transfer his skills to the professional game since he played Division II football in college and concerns over his history of injuries. He was ranked as the 14th best defensive end prospect by NFLDraftScout.com. The Baltimore Ravens selected Judon in the fifth round (146th overall) of the 2016 NFL Draft. He was the third edge rusher the Ravens drafted in 2016, behind Boise State's Kamalei Correa (second round, 42nd overall) and BYU's Bronson Kaufusi (third round, 70th overall). =2016= On May 5, 2016, the Baltimore Ravens signed Judon to a four-year, $2.59 million contract with a signing bonus of $255,736. The Baltimore Ravens opted to make Judon an outside linebacker since their 3-4 scheme would better suit him at that position over defensive end. He competed with Terrell Suggs, Elvis Dumervil, Albert McClellan, Za'Darius Smith, Kamalei Correa, Chris Carter, and Victor Ochi throughout training camp for a job as a starting outside linebacker. Head coach John Harbaugh named him the backup weakside linebacker behind veterans Terrell Suggs and Za'Darius Smith to begin the regular season. He made his professional regular season debut in the Baltimore Ravens' season-opener against the Buffalo Bills and assisted on one tackle in their 13‚Äì7 victory. Judon was inactive for Weeks 4-5 despite playing well in the first three games as the Ravens decided to play Elvis Dumervil who had recovered from his foot injury. On October 23, 2016, Judon recorded three combined tackles and made two sacks on New York Jets' quarterbacks Ryan Fitzpatrick and Geno Smith in their 24‚Äì16 loss. His first career sack on Geno Smith in the second quarter caused Smith to tear his ACL and miss the remainder of the season. During a Week 14 matchup at the New England Patriots, Judon recorded a season-high five combined tackles in their 30‚Äì23 loss. He finished the season with 27 combined tackles (12 solo), four sacks, and two pass deflections in 14 games and zero starts. Judon played minimally due to a lot of depth at the position and the Ravens staff wanting to develop. =2017= He competed with Albert McClellan, Terrell Suggs, Za'Darius Smith, Tyus Bowser, Boseko Lokombo, and Tim Williams throughout training camp for the vacant starting outside linebacker job left by the departure of Elvis Dumervil in free agency. On August 26, 2017, he recorded four solo tackles and sacked Buffalo Bills' quarterback Tyrod Taylor in their 13‚Äì9 victory. Judon was named the Baltimore Ravens' starting strongside linebacker, beating out rookie Tyus Bowser, to begin the season. Judon made his first career start in the Baltimore Ravens' season-opener at the Cincinnati Bengals and made one solo tackle and defended a pass in the Ravens' 20‚Äì0 victory. During a Week 2 against the Cleveland Browns, Judon recovered a fumble by quarterback DeShone Kizer, that help set up the Ravens' offense on an eventual touchdown scoring drive in the 24‚Äì10 victory. On October 15, 2017, Judon recorded a career-high 14 combined tackles (12 solo) and sacked Chicago Bears' quarterback Mitchell Trubisky twice in their 27‚Äì24 loss. On November 19, 2017, he collected seven combined tackles, two sacks, and forced a fumble during the Ravens' 23-0 win against the Green Bay Packers, earning him AFC Defensive Player of the Week. He finished the season playing in all 16 games with 12 starts, recording 60 combined tackles (50 solo), eight sacks, three passes defensed and two forced fumbles. His eight sacks finished second on the team behind Terrell Suggs' 11 sacks. =2018= In 2018, Judon played in 16 games with eight starts, finishing tied for second on the team with seven sacks, along with 44 combined tackles, three passes defensed, and a forced fumble. =2019= In week 11 against the Houston Texans, Judon recorded a team high 7 tackles and 2 sacks on Deshaun Watson, one of which was a strip sack on that was recovered by teammate Jaylon Ferguson, in the 41‚Äì7 win. In week 14 against the Buffalo Bills, Judon sacked Josh Allen 1.5 times, including a strip sack which was recovered by Jihad Ward during the 24‚Äì17 win which clinched a playoff berth. In week 17 against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Judon recorded a strip sack on Devlin Hodges which was recovered by teammate Michael Pierce during the 28‚Äì10 win. =2020= The Ravens placed the franchise tag on Judon on March 13, 2020. On May 28, 2020, Judon signed the one-year, $16.808 million franchise tender.

As a two-year-old he won the Vintage Stakes and finished third in the Prix Jean- Luc Lagard√®re. On his three-year-old debut he won the classic 2000 Guineas and went on to finish second in the Irish 2,000 Guineas before winning the St James's Palace Stakes. Background Galileo Gold is a flaxen chestnut horse with a white star and two white socks bred in England by Brian O'Rourke. He is from the second crop of foals sired by the miler Paco Boy whose wins included the Prix de la For√™t, Queen Anne Stakes and Lockinge Stakes. Prior to Galileo Gold, the best of his offspring had been Peacock (Fairway Stakes) and the sprint handicapper Maljaa. Galileo Gold's dam Galicuix was virtually useless as a racehorse, finishing last in both of her races. She is however, a half- sister of the leading sprinter Goldream and a great-granddaughter of the French broodmare Floripedes who was the dam of Montjeu and the grand-dam of Again. In September 2014 the yearling was auctioned at the Tattersalls Ireland sale and sold for ‚Ç¨33,000 to the bloodstock agent Amanda Skiffington. The colt entered the ownership of C J Murfitt and was sent into training with Hugo Palmer at Newmarket, Suffolk. Racing career =2015: two-year-old season= Galileo Gold made his racecourse debut on 30 May 2015 when he started at odds of 6/1 in a six furlong maiden race at York Racecourse. He finished strongly to take second place, two and three quarter lengths behind the winner Age of Empire. Ten days later at Salisbury Racecourse, the colt started odds-on favourite for a similar event and recorded his first success, winning easily from Zeeoneandonly and ten others. Galileo Gold was then moved up in distance for a race over seven furlongs at Haydock Park on 2 July. Ridden as on his two previous races by Martin Harley he started the 13/8 favourite and won by one and a half length from the John Gosden-trained Hayadh. After his win at Haydock, Galileo Gold was acquired by Sheikh Joaan Al Thani's Al Shaqab racing. He remained at Palmer's stable but Frankie Dettori took over as his regular jockey. On 28 July the colt was stepped up in class for the Group Two Vintage Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse and started the 9/2 third favourite behind Birchwood (winner of the Superlative Stakes) and the Godolphin colt Strong Challenge. The colt was settled by Dettori towards the rear of the field before switching to the right and accelerating in the last quarter mile. He took the lead a furlong out and got the best of a closely contested finish to win by three quarters of a length from Ibn Malik who took second ahead of Palawan and Twin Sails in a three-way photo finish. After the race Dettori said \\"It was an eventful race and I got the splits at the right time, but he dug deep and he won well. He showed a good attitude and I was very impressed\\". Hugo Palmer was unavailable for comment as he was on honeymoon in Turkey. Bookmakers responded by quoting the colt at odds of 33/1 for the following year's 2000 Guineas. On his final appearance of the season, Galileo Gold was sent to France to contest the Group One Prix Jean-Luc Lagard√®re over 1600 metres at Longchamp Racecourse on 4 October. Starting at odds of 7/1 in an eleven-runner field he stayed on strongly in the straight to finish third, beaten a short neck and a length by Ultra and Cymric. Commenting on the colt's defeat, Al Shaqab's racing manager Harry Herbert said that the distance might have been too short for Galileo Gold and that he may have been unsuited by the firm ground. =2016: three-year-old season= Spring On his three-year-old debut, Galileo Gold was one of thirteen colts to contest the 208th running of the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile course at Newmarket Racecourse on 30 April. The odds-on favourite for the race was Air Force Blue who had won the Phoenix Stakes, National Stakes and Dewhurst Stakes in 2015 whilst Galileo Gold started at odds of 14/1. The other contenders were Stormy Antarctic (Craven Stakes), Marcel (Racing Post Trophy), Massaat (runner-up in the Dewhurst), Buratino (Coventry Stakes) and Ribchester (Mill Reef Stakes). The starting stalls were positioned on the stands-side (the left side from the jockeys' viewpoint) and Galileo Gold's #1 draw meant that he started in the centre of the wide, straight course. He broke quickly and disputed the early lead before settling just behind the leaders as the outsider First Selection set the pace. Massaat took the lead a quarter of a mile out but Galileo Gold overtook him approaching the final furlong at which point Dettori began to track left towards the stands-side rail. Galilieo Gold stayed on well in the closing stages to win by one and a half lengths from Massaat, with Dettori indulging in a victory salute to the crowd in the final strides. After the race Hugo Palmer said \\"I‚Äôve never believed in a horse quite like I believe in this one, but it's not just about my belief in the horse, but the horse's belief in himself. I‚Äôve heard Aidan O'Brien talk about arrogant horses before, like Muhammad Ali saying ‚ÄòI am the greatest,‚Äô a good horse believes that. This horse has had such faith in himself now for three weeks, and the world has seen why today\\". On the day after the Guineas, Palmer discussed the colt's targets and said that his next race would probably be either the Irish 2000 Guineas or The Derby. Following what was described as a \\"genetic test\\" it was decided that the colt would not be aimed at the Derby as he would be unlikely to stay the mile and a half distance. Three weeks after his win at Newmarket Galileo Gold started the 5/4 favourite for the Irish 2000 Guineas at the Curragh with Air Force Blue second in the betting on 4/1. After tracking the leaders he moved up on the inside entering the straight and took second place approaching the final furlong. He was unable to make further progress and was beaten two and a half lengths by Awtaad. Summer At Royal Ascot in June Galileo Gold was matched against Awtaad and the Poule d'Essai des Poulains winner The Gurkha in the St James's Palace Stakes. After racing in second place he was sent to the front by Dettori in the straight and stayed on well to win by one and a quarter lengths from The Gurkha. Palmer commented \\"It was a tough challenge, he got the most magnificent ride from the widest draw. It's fair to say he's the best three-year-old colt in Europe... Frankie managed to get him into the most magnificent rhythm and then the horse just galloped and galloped and galloped\\". Galileo Gold faced The Gurkha and Awtaad again in the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood on 27 July, when he was also matched against older horses for the first time. He led for most of the way but was overtaken inside the final furlong and beaten a neck by The Gurkha, with Ribchester a short head away in third place. On 18 August Galileo Gold was sent to France for the Group One Prix Jacques Le Marois over 1600 metres at Deauville Racecourse. He started the 11/8 favourite but after disputing the lead for most of the way before fading in the closing stages and finishing eighth of the eleven runners behind Ribchester. Autumn After a break of over two months, Galileo Gold returned for the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot on 15 October. Starting at odds of 11/2 in a thirteen-runner field he raced prominently before being bumped and hampered in the last quarter mile and finished fifth behind Minding. =2017: four-year-old season= Galileo Gold finished fifth in the Lockinge Stakes in May on his only start as a four-year-old and was retired from racing shortly afterwards.

MTW gives PHAs exemptions from many existing public housing and voucher rules and more flexibility with how they use their Federal funds. PHAs can use special funding formulas for MTW agencies and permit agencies to shift funds between the programs or to other uses. The program is operated by 39 PHAs nationwide.  History  The Moving to Work (MTW) Demonstration program was authorized by the Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996.https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/public_indian_housing/programs/ph/mtw/history There are currently 39 MTW public housing agencies. Each agency has an agency- specific contract with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), called the MTW Standard Agreement. The MTW Standard Agreement details the flexibilities granted to MTW agencies in order to meet program and statutory goals. In 2016, at the direction of Congress, HUD provided an extension of the Standard Agreements until the end of each agency's 2028 fiscal year.https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/public_indian_housing/programs/ph/mtw/mtwsa The current 39 MTW agencies are: *Alaska Housing Finance Corporation *Atlanta Housing *Housing Authority of Baltimore City *Boulder Housing Partners *Cambridge Housing Authority *Housing Authority of Champaign County *INLIVIAN (Charlotte Housing Authority) *Chicago Housing Authority *Housing Authority of Columbus, Georgia *Delaware State Housing *DC Housing Authority *Fairfax County and Redevelopment Authority *Holyoke Housing Authority *Keene Housing *King County Housing Authority *Lawrence-Douglas County Housing Authority *Lexington Housing Authority *Lincoln Housing Authority *Louisville Housing Authority *Massachusetts Department of Housing & Community Development *Minneapolis Housing Authority *Elm City Communities (New Haven) *Oakland Housing Authority *Orlando Housing Authority *Philadelphia Housing Authority *Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh *Portage Metropolitan Housing Authority *Home Forward (Portland) *Housing Authority of the City of Reno *San Antonio Housing Authority *Housing Authority of the County of San Bernardino *San Diego Housing Commission *Housing Authority of the County of San Mateo *Housing Authority of the County of Santa Clara (including City of San Jose) *Seattle Housing Authority *Tacoma Housing Authority *Housing Authority of Tulare County *Vancouver Housing Authority  2018 renewal  HUD announced that it plans various changes to MTW beginning in 2019: *End preferential funding formulas for some MTW agencies, replaced by equitable funding to all agencies that operate public housing. *Require agencies to use at least 90 percent of their voucher funds for vouchers, rather than repurposing them. *Possibly raise the total number of families that MTW agencies must assist. *Require added evaluation of new MTW policies that pose the greatest risks for low-income families, such as major rent changes, restrictions on where families can live, time limits and work requirements.  Office of Public Housing Investments  The Office of Public Housing Investments (OPHI), within the Office of Public and Indian Housing (PIH) at HUD headquarters, oversees the MTW Demonstration.  Funding formulas  = Block grants = MTW agencies can combine Operating and Capital funds and Housing Choice Voucher funds and use them interchangeably. For example, an MTW agency could use public housing capital funds to issue additional vouchers or use voucher funds to develop more public housing to better fit the needs of its community. Agencies can funds innovative policies. For instance, an MTW Agency can use funds from its block grant to replace decaying public housing with mixed- income communities, increase the percentage of project-based vouchers to bring more affordable housing to compact markets, and reach special needs populations through the use of provider-based vouchers paired with supportive services. However MTWs must \\"assist substantially the same total number of eligible low-income families as would have been served had the funding amounts not been combined.\\" Eleven PHAs operate under modified funding formulas that allow them to receive (2013) $7,900 per unit, versus $4,100 for the other 28. Some MTW agencies use voucher funds for other purposes, including renovation, developing new housing, providing services to housing assistance recipients, supplementing agency budgets for administration and operations, or accumulating reserves. Government Accountability Office studies have found that developing new affordable housing is generally less efficient than providing vouchers for use in the private housing market.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 for having state-level significance in the themes of architecture, commerce, exploration/settlement, industry, and transportation. The district encompasses about 100 contributing properties mostly built from 1855 to 1880. It was nominated for being the well-preserved core of a Minnesota River town, and Carver County's greatest concentration of historically and architecturally significant buildings. History The city of Carver was one of the earliest communities in Carver County. Located on the Minnesota River, it was often the first place immigrants to Carver County visited. From there they spread out to other towns and farms. Norwegian immigrant Axel Jorgenson settled in the area that became Carver in the winter of 1851‚Äì1852. In 1854 Jorgenson sold his land to a group of townsite investors from Saint Paul, called the Carver Land Company. Minnesota Territorial Governor Alexander Ramsey was part of this group. He suggested the name \\"Carver\\" for the town site after Jonathan Carver, who first explored the area. By 1855 the town of Carver was already growing. It had a tailor, a hotel, a boarding house, a building designer, a carpenter, a livery stable, a blacksmith, two shoemakers, and a general store. By 1857, 35 buildings existed in Carver. The area was a main stopping point in trade and immigrant travel along the Minnesota River. In 1877 Carver was incorporated as the Village of Carver. By the 1890s Carver was one of the biggest settlements in the county. Carver's future changed with the loss of river trade during railroad development. When railroads were built, they bypassed Carver, taking businesses with them. The Prohibition era from 1920 to 1933 made this worse, as many saloons and hotels shut down. Carver became impoverished. Simple lack of money protected historic structures from being torn down. There was no new building and growth. However more was needed to stop future destruction of the historic town. On June 25, 1969 a non-profit corporation called Carver-on-the-Minnesota, Incorporated was created. The group began by raising money to buy buildings in need of repair. This was the seed of the Carver Historic District. Carver-on-the-Minnesota created restoration plans and design guidelines for restorations in historic Carver. They also serve as a source for historic building research. Their work led to even more buildings being preserved. In 1980, the old town of Carver was chosen as one of the first historic districts in Minnesota, due in part to the work of this organization. Carver Historic District contains 87 buildings and four other structures of importance. National Register signs mark many district buildings. They vary from private homes and businesses to churches and public buildings. Buildings range in time from 1852‚Äì1925. Many of them have been returned to their original look and style. In February 1989 the city of Carver created a Heritage Preservation Commission. Their goal was to help the City Council, Planning and Zoning Commission, and Parks Department with preservation work. Carver was named a Preserve America community by the federal government in 2007. It was only the eighth so to be named in the state of Minnesota.

The producer's self-acclaimed concept is that of an amorphous, anonymous, space- bound being that utilizes time travel to collect and mix different eras of music which attributes to the hip hop undertone, sampling and electronic themes presented. Toaster's mythology within its universe is further explored on the producer's social media outlets. Very little is known of the origins of Time Travelling Toaster such as, gender, ethnicity, age, as all are undocumented besides the composer claiming origins to Japan.  History  To its own account, the origins of the producer come from the persona having a trip from psilocybin usage to which the entity spontaneously formed. Many of Time Travelling Toaster's self-acclaimed attributes are based on fictional comic book superpowers such as telepathy, telekinesis, energy and sound manipulation; to which the producer claims is a process to its sound design. The producer is usually depicted with a piece(s) of toasted bread, or a toaster with toasted bread showing. Like fellow producer and musical artist Madlib's Quasimoto and Flying Lotus's Captain Murphy alter egos, the music is very story centric to the respective persona's world and experiences. Toaster has an ongoing beat tape series called \\"SPACE TOAST\\" based on the Space Ghost Coast to Coast cartoon series. \\"Spacebump #2\\", from the series's second release SPACE TOAST VOL. 2, was featured on writer and actor Kevin Allison's weekly podcast radio show RISK!. During 2011, Toaster was first publicly introduced on popular European marijuana activist podcast Dopefiend.co.uk with bump music, starting the producer's fanbase. In 2013, TIme Travelling Toaster released Color Spacesound Turbulence, a debut EP which showcases explorative electronic themes with few hip hop involvement. The experimental effort, though lacking thicker sonics, are more explored in later releases. Sinus Roris (Latin for \\"Bay of Dew\\"), Toaster's debut album, was released digitally on March, 2014. Sinus Roris, based on an impact location on the moon, is a more raw and darker attempt exploring themes of the moon landing, selenography, and moon myths. The album was a departure from the previous light tones presented in Color Spacesound Turbulence, focusing more on grittier hip hop movements, electronic-jazz fusion, and break beat. Corry Banks, co-founder and lead editor of hip-hop culture website BBOY Tech Report, in a 2014 highlight for Sinus Roris states, \\"‚ÄòTTT‚Äô, as we affectionately call him, was declared one of our 13 favorite beatmakers of 2013 and deservedly so.\\". Banks also added, \\"His projects show a fixation with the mysteries and beauties of space and ‚ÄòSinus Roris‚Äô,..., continues to chronicle the journeys of an intrepid explorer of those vast and enigmatic expanses.\\". Music from 'Sinus Roris' was featured on segment of a video podcast on DoubleToasted.com. In August, 2014, TTT contributed to electronic music and culture website EverythingIsChemical.com's monthly EICV7 mixtape series, providing the 82nd edition. Time Travelling Toaster and recording artist Tone Royal (Ray Villareal) from DoubleToasted.com announced plans for a collaborative project set to release late 2016 or early 2017. Toaster releases new music on its official SoundCloud, Bandcamp, and blog.  Personality  Toaster as a character, heavily references time travel, alternate universes, dimensions and incorporating obscure space terms to create music usually within genres of hip-hop, psychedelic, and electronic. Reminiscent to Marvin the Martian, when communicating via social media outlets, the producer refers to people as \\"earthlings\\". Toaster refers to its music as 'travels', and fans of the producer are known as \\"travelers\\". It is yet known if Time Travelling Toaster is a single solo artist, group or collaborative effort. In an episode of The Simpsons entitled Treehouse of Horror V, a parody of A Sound of Thunder, while attempting to fix a broken toaster, Homer accidentally turns it into a time machine.  Influences and style  Time Travelling Toaster itself has cited J Dilla, Madlib, Flying Lotus, and japanese animation, time travel, and astrology as musical influences.

Mama goes to bed, and Kayode and Kunle discuss politics and the meaning of family extending beyond bloodlines. Kunle expresses his appreciate for Kayode explaining how he is not trying to replace him as Mama's son. = Scene 4 = Kunle and Kayode go to a bar for drinks, when Chief Olowolaye, a feared local politician enters. The Chief is under the assumption that Kayode has returned to Nigeria to invest in the Chief's political campaign after Kayode's failed run for office in England. Kayode explains this is not the case; but the Chief takes this as an insult, and the two get into a fist fight. Kayode storms out of the bar, but Kunle stays behind with the Chief. = Scene 5 = The police commissioner for the town arrives to arrest Kayode on charges of assaulting Chief Olowolaye. = Scene 6 = Back in England, Fola continues to criticize Rita for not having a children and accuses her of disliking Nigerians and African culture. = Scene 7 = Kayode returns from the custody of the police, who have beaten him severely. Mama paid 4500 pounds as a bribe to have Kayode released. = Scene 8 = Rita and Fola continue arguing about Rita's resistance to accepting her African heritage. = Scene 9 = Kayode tries to convince Kunle to run together for local office. Mama supports the idea, but Kunle is offended that Kayode is trying to \\"save Nigeria\\" when he doesn't even live there. = Scene 10 = Kayode continues on with his campaign without Kunle. He goes to the marketplace where he explains his goals of advancing Nigeria into the 21st century to the street vendors. He incites a chant, gaining the support of the vendors and locals. = Scene 11 = The Chief threatens Kunle that if he does not win the election, Kunle will owe him 100 million pounds. On his last straw, Kunle insults the Chief and storms out on him, leaving the Chief shocked and scared. = Scene 12 = Kayode is practicing his speech. Rita and Fola have traveled to Nigeria to join Kayode on his campaign but Rita gets in an argument with Kayode over whether he is going to stay in London or move to Nigeria. The play ends with Kunle entering Mama's home, coughing up blood, presumably from being attacked by the Chief. He is severely injured.  Production History and Reception  Belong has received workshops and readings around the England and the greater United Kingdom. On Thursday, April 26, 2012 the show premiered directed by Indhu Rubasingham at the Royal Court Theatre in Sloan Square in London in a coproduction with Tiata Fahodzi. The Telegraph praised Belong for being \\"sharp, funny, touching and, finally, disturbing\\" but criticized the text for being highly unbelievable, claiming audience members can only enjoy it if there are good at \\"suspending [their] incredulity.\\" Bell, Charlotte. \\"Cultural Practices, Market Disorganization, And Urban Regeneration: Royal Court Theatre Local Peckham And Peckham Space.\\" Contemporary Theatre Review24.2 (2014): 192-208.

(1995) Statistical Methods in the Atmospheric science, Academic Press. (page 42) Similarly, a standardized anomaly equals an anomaly divided by a standard deviation. A group of anomalies can be analyzed spatially, as a map, or temporally, as a time series. It should not be confused for an isolated outlier. There are examples in atmospheric sciences and in geophysics. Calculation The location and scale measures used in forming an anomaly time-series may either be constant or may themselves be a time series or a map. For example, if the original time series consisted of daily mean temperatures, the effect of seasonal cycles might be removed using a deseasonalization filter. Robust statistics, resistant to the effects of outliers, are sometimes used as the basis of the transformation. Examples =Atmospheric sciences= In the atmospheric sciences, the climatological annual cycle is often used as the expected value. Famous atmospheric anomalies are for instance the Southern Oscillation index (SOI) and the North Atlantic oscillation index.

The game was released as a demo on April 19, 2015, and officially on Steam for Microsoft Windows on March 14, 2016. Linux and Mac OS X versions were also made available a few months later.  Gameplay  Deadbolt is a stealth-action hybrid that allows you to take control of the Reaper to quell the recent undead uprising. In it, players complete missions given to them by the mysterious fireplace as they become the avatar of death, with a wide arsenal of guns at their disposal. The game centers on the player character, the Reaper, as he progresses through three sets of nine levels filled with hordes of undead that he must kill. There are four types of undead seen throughout the game: zombies, vampires, skeletons (also known as Dredged) and demons. Each set of levels is based on an undead type: the first set of nine levels focuses on zombies, the next set focuses on vampires, and the last focuses on the Dredged and demons. Although there is only four overarching enemy categories, there are over thirty-five actual enemy types. Levels vary from different settings that you would expect to see in a dark, crime-filled world: from downtrodden houses in the ghetto, to nightclubs, abandoned warehouses, and docks. The game also includes a map editor where levels can be shared on the Steam workshop. Objectives within vary from level to level. Sometimes the player is tasked with assassinating gang leaders, investigating mysteries, or maybe just leaving nothing alive; whichever it is, there is not one way to do it. Within levels there are no set paths or sequences, giving the player freedom to complete them in any way they like, as long as the main objective is satisfied. Once a level is finished, the Reaper returns to his car and back to his safe house, where he is awarded souls, which act as the game's currency. The player can then spend these souls with the Ferryman to acquire new weapons to bring on their missions. However, souls are only awarded the first time a level is completed, and there are not enough souls that can be obtained in one play through to buy all the available weapons, forcing the player to decide wisely. In addition to the weapons the Reaper carries into the mission, he can make use of various weapons laying around the map, or taken from defeated enemies. Throughout the levels, the Reaper can randomly acquire cassette tapes by killing certain enemy types. These tapes - which contain the personal stories of the Reaper's victims - can be listened to back in the safe house, giving the player further insights into the world of the game.

It stars Mark Strong in the lead role of Captain William Stanaforth, the first person on a lone mission to Mars. Luke Wilson and Sanaa Lathan are also featured in supporting roles. It was released on June 3, 2016 by Paramount Pictures and Vertical Entertainment. Plot Captain William Stanaforth (Strong) is on a one-way solo mission to Mars, taking humanity‚Äôs first steps towards colonizing it. Although the entire world is watching him, he is completely alone on the space ship. After liftoff and the subsequent rocket separations, Stanaforth takes his suit off to relax and is set on course to Mars by the team on the ground. Through flashbacks we see how Stanaforth had come up with the idea to create water () by supercompressing sand/dirt and combining the separate hydrogen and oxygen byproducts. It is by this synthesis that the mission is made possible. Stanaforth's water generation apparatus malfunctions during his mission to Mars. Rather than return to Earth as protocol requires, he takes manual control of his spacecraft and continues to Mars. His spacecraft becomes entangled with a nebula and through voiceover we hear Stanaforth ruminate on the nature of matter and space. Stanaforth says, \\"This is why I came here. To give everything up. For one moment of pure wonder.\\" Stanaforth is then seen in his spacesuit, exiting the spacecraft. Without explanation, the scene cuts to Stanaforth, clean-shaven in his spacecraft, preparing to land on Mars. Stanaforth lands on, then walks, on Mars. As he walks, we hear Stanaforth say, \\"Nothing has ever lived here. Nothing has even died here. Maybe I'll live forever.\\" Cast * Mark Strong as Captain William D.

Biography Annabel Soutar was born in Westmount, Quebec, to Ian Alexander Soutar, an investment banker and philanthropist, and Helgi Soutar. She has two siblings, James Soutar and Adam Soutar. She graduated with an A.B. in English from Princeton University in 1994 after completing an 174-page-long senior thesis, titled \\"Of Beauty Born - A Journal of the Creative Process\\", under the supervision of Michael Cadden. At Princeton, she studied English and theatre and discovered the early documentary plays of Anna Deavere Smith, whose plays influenced her to create drama which focuses primarily on social action and critique. In 1998, Soutar and her husband actor Alex Ivanovici began work on the play Novembre by interviewing people about the 1998 provincial election in Quebec. Lacking an official title for this endeavor, Soutar and Ivanovici came up with the name \\"Porte Parole\\" (French for 'spokesperson') which has since become an award- winning Montreal company. Soutar is still the artistic director of Projet Porte Parole and is focused on producing theater of immediate social relevance. Soutar's work explores contemporary issues such as the high-tech industry (2000 Questions, 2002), the health care system in Quebec (Sante, 2002), and the 2006 collapse of the De la Concorde overpass in Montreal that left five people dead (Sexy B√©ton (which translates to English as 'Sexy concrete'), 2009). Soutar gained national acclaim for her play Seeds, a re- enactment of the legal battle between Percy Schmeiser and Monsanto Inc, which was called \\"one of the most important new works to appear on the Canadian stage in recent times.\\" Most recently, her play The Watershed was commissioned to appear as part of the cultural events associated with the 2015 Pan American Games. Soutar's work is notable both for its exploration of contemporary issues and for its inclusion of herself, her friends, and her family as characters. In The Watershed, for instance, Soutar, played by Kristen Thomson, leads her family (portrayed by other actors) on a cross-country journey in an effort to understand why a federal omnibus bill eliminated funding for the Experimental Lakes Area. Her children are played by other actors while her husband, actor Alex Ivanovici, plays himself. Her theatrical style incorporates elements of both epic theater and naturalism and her scripts are compiled by recreating dialogue from published transcripts or personal interviews. Soutar has had two daughters with Ivanovici, Beatrice and Ella. Awards and honours Soutar has been nominated for several awards by the Soir√©e des Masques de l'Acad√©mie qu√©b√©coise (\\"Prix de la Revelation\\" 2001), Acad√©mie qu√©b√©cois du th√©√¢tre (Best New Text, Best English Production, 2006), and Le Prix Michel Tremblay (2009).

College career White chose to major in business administration, and after not receiving a redshirt designation by the Yellow Jackets, played in the last 10 games of the season and forced a fumble in conference play against North Carolina. He followed up his efforts in his sophomore year by playing in every game that season, and starting at defensive back for nine of them. During the Music City Bowl against Ole Miss, White recorded the first interception of his college career in the fourth quarter. He continued to improve in his junior year as he started every game of the season. During the game against the Virginia Tech Hokies, he recorded his second interception and set up what was ultimately the game-winning drive. A week later, he stopped a 75-yard run by forcing a fumble out of the back of the end zone against the Pittsburgh Panthers that went for a touchback. On November 8, 2014, White had his first career touchdown against North Carolina State when he intercepted a pass by Jacoby Brissett by stepping in front of his wide receiver and running it back 48 yards for the touchdown. He finished the season with four interceptions, leading the team. In addition he also led the team in pass break-ups with eight, and also registered one forced fumble. His efforts resulted in him being named an All-ACC honorable mention by the media. In his final year with the Yellow Jackets, White started 11 games. He started out the season recording five tackles and five pass break-ups against Virginia Tech. He went on to force a fumble against North Carolina a month later. He finished the year leading the team in pass-breakups, and two interceptions. Professional career White's play in college earned him an invitation to the NFL Scouting Combine. Lance Zierlein of NFL.com praised him for his patience in coverage and his ability to displace receivers with his jam technique. He also complimented his ability to break on the ball with his short quickness, and noted that he had forced at least one fumble every year he was at Georgia Tech. But Zierlein criticized his \\"very\\" average recovery speed and his inability to efficiently exercise proper technique in coverage, specifically the fact that he could not turn around fast enough or \\"flip his hips\\" quickly. He projected White to be a third round pick. =Kansas City Chiefs= White was drafted by the Kansas City Chiefs in the sixth round, 178th overall, of the 2016 NFL Draft.

Acquired lines The CNER inherited the following lines or systems from the Canadian Northern Railway and unified them under one management: * Niagara, St. Catharines and Toronto Railway - an interurban system operating on the Niagara Peninsula * Toronto Suburban Railway - Guelph and Woodbridge lines only * Toronto Eastern Railway - a line never completed Associated lines The CNER was closely associated with three railways which Canadian National Railways inherited from the Grand Trunk Railway. These railways never became a corporate part of the CNER: * Oshawa Railway - a passenger and freight operation in Oshawa, Ontario * Thousand Islands Railway - a shortline in Gananoque, Ontario - never electrified * Montreal and Southern Counties Railway - an interurban between Montreal and Granby, Quebec with a branch to Longueuil Radial network With the creation of the CNER, CNR president Henry Thornton was enthusiastic to develop Canadian National's own network of electric railways. This followed setbacks that Adam Beck had in promoting an Ontario Hydro radial network with its subsidiary the Hydro-Electric Railways. Thornton planned to link the unfinished Toronto Eastern Railway to the Toronto Suburban Railway's Guelph line via the Toronto Belt Line Railway running through northern Toronto. There was also another plan to extend the Guelph line from its \\"temporary\\" terminal at Keele Street and St. Clair Avenue to downtown via the nearby CNR line. The CNER's Toronto Suburban district never turned a profit, and its abandonment in 1931 was the result of huge deficits from that line.

Gr√ºninger was one of the single most prolific printers of Strasbourg, printing up to 80 books a year. While a great deal of his publications were Catholic, he managed to print a great variety of works ranging from humanist to scientific texts. His work was fairly equally representative of both Latin and the vernacular; about 39% of his works were printed in Latin and the remaining 61% in German. Gr√ºninger was born as Johannes Reinhart in 1455 in the town of Markgr√∂ningen, W√ºrttemberg (from which he took his name \\"Gr√ºninger\\"). He learned about the printing trade in Basel before he moved to Strasbourg which was experiencing a boom in the printing industry. Between 1508 and 1528 about 70 printers had established themselves in Strasbourg. Gr√ºninger had a head start on this competition and in 1481 he moved to Strasbourg. A year later bought his print shop and in August 1483, he printed his first book, Petrus Comestor's Historia Scholastica. Some of his notable publications include a German-language Bible, and illustrated editions of Horace's Opera, and Virgil's Aeneid. Gr√ºninger died in 1532 and was succeeded by his sons Wolfgang and Bartholomew (primarily Bartholomew, who was also a printer albeit on a smaller scale than his father). As was common, his sons promptly sold the business to Peter Sch√∂ffer (the younger) in 1533 after being unable to maintain past production rates.  Notable Publications Religious Texts Gr√ºninger was responsible for printing many Breviaries for dioceses across the Holy Roman Empire, especially in the first decade of his career. In fact, he was one of the chief printers of breviaries within the Empire. He also printed many missals that were transported across Europe. His largest contribution to the printed religious text is his German family Bible which was the tenth Bible printed in the German language and the first \\"handy-sized\\" Bible. Gr√ºninger's Bible was printed in two volumes, each containing about 460 leaves and was illustrated with 109 woodcuts. At 28 x 20 cm this Bible was almost half the size of the average printed Bible at the time. In 1522 Gr√ºninger found himself in trouble with the Strasbourg authorities after publishing an anti-Lutheran book by Thomas Murner titled Von dem Gr√∂ssen Lutherischen Narren.\\" At the time, the reformation had a strong presence in Strasbourg and in response, Strasbourg officials confiscated Gr√ºninger's prints of Murner's book. Classics Despite printing primarily religious texts, Gr√ºninger printed three major Classical texts in his career. In 1496 he printed Terence's Comidiae, in 1498 he printed Horace's Opera, and in 1502 he printed Virgil's Aeneid. Horace's Opera (1498) Leaf from Gr√ºninger's publication of Horace's Opera printed in 1498. This particular leaf is from the last fifteen lines of satire 1.10. In 1498, Gr√ºninger printed the first illustrated edition of Horace's Opera with commentary by Jakob Locher. This is the only printing of Horace before 1500 to contain commentary. It has been argued that this printing of Horace was intended for pedagogical purposes rather than merely entertainment. Locher was a humanist and stated in an epigram that Horace was not for the consumption of ordinary people, but for the educated. He probably intended this book to be for those either learning Latin and Horace or already learned in these topics which could explain this text's unique use of marginal commentaries which are in keeping with medieval pedagogical tradition (except that they seem to provide more background information on the poetry than directions on how to morally read the text). In between the lines of the text itself can be seen explanatory words that clarify abbreviations and names thus helping the reader follow along while at the same time learning some Latin conventions. Given that there seem to be a decent number of surviving copies, this (and Gr√ºninger's prints of Comidiae by Terence (1496) and Vergil's Aeneid (1502)) book seems to have been a success when released. Virgil's Aeneid (1502) Woodcut from Brant's Aeneid printed by Gr√ºninger in September 1502 Gr√ºninger's 1502 publication of the Aeneid was edited by Sebastian Brant, who also wrote the well known Ship of Fools in 1494. The woodcuts in the Aeneid are notable in that they depict characters and architecture in contemporary clothing and style. Geography Gr√ºninger printed nearly 100,000 woodcut maps between 1510 and 1530. He was the most prolific printer of wall maps in the entire Holy Roman Empire of his time. The main geographic works that came out of Gr√ºninger's press were an edition of Ptolemy's Geography prepared by Lorenz Fries (1521), another edition of the Geography in 1525, and a reduced version of Martin Waldseem√ºller's Carta Marina, also prepared by Fries in 1525.

Biography Sylvia Estes was born into slavery in Clay County, Missouri, the youngest of three children of Hannah and Howard Estes. Her father bought the family out of slavery for $4,000 in 1852. The family moved to California. Faced with educational and other social barriers, the family joined a group of people who sent a delegation to speak about resettling there ‚Äì they had an audience with British Columbia Governor James Douglas, who was of Creole descent. In 1855, Sylvia married Louis Stark, a farmer. They emigrated to Canada during the 1858 BC Gold Rush, taking a ship with 600 African Americans, under the threat of the Fugitive Slave Act and the Dred Scott v. Sandford decision. In 1860, Stark, her husband Louis and her two small children, Emma Arabella and Willis Otis, settled Salt Spring Island, cleared land and made a home and orchard. They survived the smallpox epidemic of 1862 and went on to raise seven children. Stark's husband died mysteriously and the family's two close friends were also murdered. In 1875, the family moved to Cedar, British Columbia, just outside Nanaimo, but Sylvia returned to the farm in 1885.

Nzewi is a Nigerian artist, art historian, and curator, currently curator in the Department of Painting and Sculpture at Museum of Modern Art in New York City. He was raised in Enugu and studied under sculptor El Anatsui at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, before traveling as an artist and curator. In the United States, he completed his doctorate at Emory University in 2013 and became the curator of African art at Dartmouth College's Hood Museum of Art. In 2017, he moved to the Cleveland Museum of Art. Nzewi has curated the Nigerian Afrika Heritage Biennial three times, the Dak'Art biennial in 2014, and independent exhibitions at Atlanta's High Museum of Art and New York's Richard Taittinger Gallery. Nzewi also exhibited internationally as an artist and artist-in-resident.  Early life and career  Nzewi was born in Nigeria and raised in Enugu. He studied sculpture under El Anatsui at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, and received a bachelor's degree in fine and applied art in 2001. After graduating, Nzewi traveled internationally for six years as an independent artist and curator, and was involved in the curation of three iterations of the Afrika Heritage Biennial. In 2006, Nzewi moved to Cape Town, South Africa, where he worked on a yearlong postgraduate program in Museum and Heritage Studies at the University of Western Cape while serving as an artist-in-residence at the Greatmore Studio in Woodstock, Cape Town. The next year, 2007, Nzewi moved to Atlanta, Georgia, and began a doctorate degree in art history at Emory University. During his doctoral years, he curated at Atlanta's High Museum (2009) and received Robert Sterling Clark and Smithsonian fellowships. He wrote his dissertation on the Dak'Art biennial's influence on contemporary African art, and graduated in May 2013. The following August, Nzewi became the Dartmouth College Hood Museum of Art's first curator of African art, where he mounted shows on Eric Van Hove and Ekpe textiles. After four years, Nzewi left Dartmouth to become the Cleveland Museum of Art's curator of African art. Among his considerations as a curator, Nzewi cites the importance of art history and his curiosity in how artworks reveal collective social imagination through expression and interpretation. He has expressed interest in learning from the creative process as artists make intellectual decisions about their work on reflection of how it will be received by others and the market. He has published essays in multiple academic art journals, contributed to Grove Art Online, and co- edited a volume on independent African art initiatives. Nzewi served among the three curators of the 2014 Dak'Art biennial, which focused on themes of globalization (expressed through African ideas of communalism) and anonymity. Dak'Art had served as important link between the African and international art world, and Nzewi helped to situate the show's own role in developing \\"pan- African internationalism\\". In mid-2015, Nzewi curated a monthlong survey of African art at the Richard Taittinger Gallery in New York. The show was named after the 1967 comedy-drama film Guess Who's Coming to Dinner In late 2016, Nzewi served as a guest curator at the Shanghai Biennale. As an artist, Nzewi has participated in shows and residencies in Africa, Europe, and the United States. He has collaborated with Emeka Ogboh, whom he met in college. Under the moniker One-Room Shack, the pair prepared an installation for the Watermans Arts Centre in 2012 in which visitors walk through interconnected letters that spell \\"UNITY\\", a reflection on the Olympic spirit. Nzewi was appointed Steven and Lisa Tananbaum Curator in the Department of Painting and Sculpture at the New York Museum of Modern Art in March 2019. He started his new job on July 22.

Trained as a photojournalist, his works explore cities and consumerism. In his \\"Found Not Taken\\" series, the artist resituates abandoned objects elsewhere within cities. Another series uses African masks as a trope for understanding consumerism in Luanda, his home city. Chagas represented Angola at the 2013 Venice Biennale, for which he won its Golden Lion for best national pavilion. He has also exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art and Brooklyn Museum.  Early life  Edson Chagas was born in Luanda, Angola, in 1977. He has a degree in photojournalism from the London College of Communication and studied documentary photography at the University of Wales, Newport. As of 2015, he continues to live in Luanda and works as the image editor for Expans√£o, an Angolan newspaper.  Career  Chagas represented Angola at the country's first Venice Biennale national pavilion in 2013. His exhibition placed on the floor giveaway, poster-sized photographs of discarded objects positioned in relation to weathered architecture in the Angolan capital, Luanda. These poster stacks were in \\"stark juxtaposition\\" with the opulent, Catholic decorations of the host, Palazzo Cini, which had been closed for the previous two decades. The New York Times called the pavilion a \\"breakout star\\" of the Biennale, and it won the biennial's top prize, the Golden Lion for best national pavilion. The jury praised his showing of the \\"irreconcilability and complexity of site\\". Frieze wrote that the pavilion showed a \\"relational attitude to space, ... responsive to context and not overly concerned with diplomacy and reifying otherness\\", as other African nation pavilions had been. Artsy Giles Peppiatt named the series as a highlight and recommended purchase at the 2014 1:54 contemporary African art fair. The photographs on display came from Chagas's larger series, \\"Found Not Taken\\", which included conceptually similar photographs from citiesin addition to Luandawhere the photographer had spent time: London and Newport, Wales. The curators had asked Chagas to only display the photographs from Luanda for the Biennale, which he found acceptable since it didn't take the series out of context. He found that the cities, which were each preparing to host major events, demonstrated a \\"sense of renewal\\" in its culture. Coming from Luanda, where everything was reused, Chagas noted how consumer habits have evolved over time. He photographed each object in spaces where it interacted with its environment. Some objects were shot in nearly the same space as they were found, while others had to be moved. Through this method, Chagas felt that he learned the city's rhythm. He has said that he plans to continue the series. Chagas showed two different series in 2014. His works at the 1:54 art fair included large- format portraits that used African masks as a trope to comment on African identity. His \\"Oikonomo\\" series of self-portraits with shopping bags over his head were intended to hide his identity behind symbols of globalized capitalism and secondhand consumerism in Luandasecondhand goods permeate African consumer culture. Some of the bags include imagery such as a \\"World of Hope\\" slogan and a map of the Caribbean islands. This series, originally from 2011, was later shown at the Brooklyn Museum's 2016 \\"Disguise: Masks and Global African Art\\" exhibition. Hyperallergic highlighted the performativity in the artist wearing a Barack Obama bag over his head as kitschy, funny, and like another persona. Later in 2014, at Paris Photo, Chagas showed a portrait photograph series, \\"Tipo Passe\\", depicting models dressed in contemporary attire and wearing traditional, pre-colonial African masks. The clothes came from street markets and import retailers, while the masks came from a private collection. Hyperallergic described one such image, with its carved wood mask and plaid madras shirt a \\"delightfully incongruous combination\\". The prints were made in editions of seven. In 2015, Chagas was chosen for the Museum of Modern Art's \\"Ocean of Images: New Photography 2015\\" contemporary photography exhibition. His selectionsfrom prior series \\"Found Not Taken\\", \\"Tino Passe\\", and \\"Oikonomo\\"focused on themes of cities and consumerism.

Helen Lucas‚Äô distinguished career as an artist spans over five decades.  Early life  Lucas was raised in Saskatoon, the eldest daughter of loving Greek parents. Her parents had emigrated from Greece. When she was six weeks old her family moved to Saskatchewan to operate the Ritz Hotel. She was never encouraged by her family to do art as they were preoccupied with establishing a new life and a good living in Saskatchewan. The impact of traditional religious observance on her day-to-day life resulted in good manners. After high school Lucas studied pre-medicine for a year before moving to Toronto to study at the Ontario College of Art, where she began to paint. Her parents encouraged this, financially supporting her through college. Though her first show received some positive reviews, she says she was advised by the Greek Church to reduce her artistic endeavours in order to make time for her first love, her devotion to religious studies.  Career  Lucas taught at Sheridan College in Oakville, Ontario, as Drawing and Painting Master from 1973 to 1979. While there, she produced a series of political black and white pieces and worked alongside Shelagh Wilkinson, co-founder of Canadian Woman Studies. Lucas' work is best known for large canvases devoted to colourful flowers, but earlier sketches and paintings explored icons of the Greek Orthodox Church, the Virgin Mary, and female sexuality. The dark nature reflected in Lucas' work during this period has been linked to her deep religious faith, the turmoil of learning to live away from her family in Saskatoon, her guilt at her parents‚Äô financial sacrifice for her education, and the unhappiness she experienced during her 20-year marriage to her first husband. Lucas explains that during this period she \\"had no feeling for colour.\\" The thematic transition of Lucas' work was chronicled in a film by Donna Davey, Helen Lucas: Her Journey -- Our Journey, which won the Gold Plaque for Best Documentary at the Chicago International Film Festival. The film included an interview with her friend, Margaret Laurence. Lucas's drawings were included in Laurence's book, A Christmas Birthday Story (New York and Toronto, 1980). Laurence described Lucas' contributions as \\"joyous, beautiful and wise.\\" In addition to delivering lectures on women in the arts, Lucas appeared rarely on radio and television from the 1970s to the 1990s. She has exhibited her art in Canada, the United States, Europe, Africa and Japan. Several works were acquired by public collections in Canada and by private international collections. Lucas has published drawings and text in several newspapers, magazines, and journals, and she has been an active participant in Canadian women studies projects. Nearing ninety, she no longer paints and instead spends her time thinking of her late parents who put her through art school. She lives in King Township, Ontario where she lived with her second husband, Derek Fuller, until his death in 1996. = Awards and Distinctions = In 2012 she was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal, as well as having been awarded an Honorary Doctor of Letters by York University in 1991.

The book gives account of the terrorist activities and numerous wars in the region. His journey includes reporting in Egypt, Iraq, and Lebanon.  About the author  Richard Engel is an American journalist who was born on September 16, 1973 in New York. He grew up in Manhattan, where he attended Riverdale Country School. After graduating, he went on to attend Stanford University and earned a B.A. in foreign relations. He knew he wanted to be a journalist and decided to move to the middle east, because he knew that‚Äôs where the next big story would be. He began as a freelance reporter working for many news agencies such as ABC, USA today, and BBC World Service. He lived in Egypt, Iraq, and Syria so he could get the first hand accounts of any news or events. He is one of very few reporters and the only American television correspondent to cover the entire war in Iraq. He also covered the war in Afghanistan, and the revolution in Libya. He can speak many dialects of Arabic and also Spanish and Italian. Over his long career, he has survived IED attacks, kidnappings, and ambushes, He was named chief foreign correspondent for NBC news in 2008 and has won seven news and documentary Emmys. He is now the author of three books. NBC News Retrieved 2016-5-1 Synopsis Richard Engel begins talking about graduating from Stanford and wanting to become a reporter but not your typical reporter, he wanted to focus on something more than the stock market so he moved to the middle east in 1996, when people like Saddam Hussein, Gadhafi, and Mubarak were the big leaders. At this time under the big men the middle east was angry, oppressed and rotten to the core. He lived in Cairo where he talks about how different it is from the US such as having no privacy and not speaking to a woman for two years. Engel talks about how everything in the media was heavily censored when he worked for the Middle East Times. The first attack he saw was a bus shooting and burning in Tahrir Square one of the busiest parts of downtown Cairo, he saw people shot and melted into their bus seats. He counts this and the attack in Luxor the first Al-Qaeda-style attacks. He talks about Islam and its origins- Islam's message- all men are equal in prayer, humbled together in communal submission, rich and poor side by side. Mohammad asked for 5 daily prayers, a weekly gathering with a short sermon, partial fasting for a month each year, and a once-in-a- lifetime pilgrimage to Mecca, called the hajj, for those who could afford it. After World War I and the treaties and promises made by Europeans it left the middle east hopelessly divided. After World War II the US pretty much was the Middle East's guardian of stability. After 9/11 when Bush said he was launching a crusade many Muslims took that at face value. Engel started freelancing in 1998 for ABC, The World, and other news organizations. The hardcore Egyptian jihadists joined the holy wars in Afghanistan against the soviets then would return and get put in jail and murdered so they ran to the mountains where they would live and later form standing armies one of which is AL-Qaeda. Richard Engel started his foreign corresponding in Egypt, which he describes in the first chapter. Starting in the second chapter, Engel realizes that the good reporting will be moving around the middle east, with the next stop being Israel. Engel lived in Jerusalem and started to make a name for himself with his big international stories. These stories were mostly based on the relations between the Israelis and Palestinians, which were governed by the Oslo II Accord, splitting the Palestinian land into three areas with different governing power given to the Israelis. The Israelis did not treat the Palestinians well, which led to Intifadas, Arabic for uprising. The Second Intifada included a cycle: Israeli soldiers lining Palestinian streets, Palestinians rebelling against them, the soldiers firing at first rubber bullets, but then actual ammunition, and the Palestinians having funerals for the dead which led to more reason to rebel. The cycle went on and on. The Palestinians soon resorted to suicide bombings in order to get more national attention. The conflict ended when the leader of the Palestinians, Yasser Arafat, was captured, and Israel went into the Palestine area with Operation Defensive Shield and captured almost all the cities. Soon after, the events on September 11, 2001 made it clear to Engel that the best reporting would now be in Iraq. Engel covered Iraq for 3 years, slowly gaining friends on the inside that could help him and enemies that would come after all reporters. The conflict here was between Sunni and Shiite Muslims. Saddam Hussein was the leader of the Sunnis and the leader of Iraq, and Engel had to endure countless sleepless nights because of the bombs that went off everywhere around the country. The Sunnis were the majority, but the US backed the Shiites and pushed for democracy after they took down Saddam Hussein. But, after Hussein was taken, it brought out the rotten core and extremists of the Sunnis, including Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. Engel credits him to the start of ISIS, including the first beheading video of Nick Berg, an American freelance construction contractor. After many attacks by Zarqawi and his group, who strived to be like Osama Bin Laden and al-Qaeda, Zarqawi was killed by US special forces. Engel‚Äôs next home would be Iran.

She is an exile from Chile and Argentina and has lived in the UK since 1976.  Early life  After her graduation from the National University of the Littoral in 1960, Zabaleta became a practicing National Public Accountant and Expert. After further studies at the ESCOLATINA, University of Chile, in Santiago from 1963-64, her academic expertise became the economic and social development of Latin America. She then pursued and received her D.Phil. in Development Studies at the Institute of Development Studies (IDS) at Sussex University in 1989. Zabaleta's early feminist and humanitarian vocation earned her imprisonment by the military regimes of General Juan Domingo Per√≥n (1954) in Argentina and General Augusto Pinochet (1973) in Chile. Repatriated by a decree of the President of Argentina in 1973, she was expelled by the de facto government of Jorge Rafael Videla (1976), destined for the United Kingdom.  Later life  Now, in her ‚Äúold‚Äù age, Zabaleta is proud of not having been broken despite being so fiercely persecuted in her struggle for a more equal world. Her work as an organizer and cultural promoter, initiated in exile, is varied, extensive, and difficult to summarize. Reflecting on her past led, among other things, to write poetry again after a thirty-year hiatus imposed by the trauma of exile. As a writer and poet, her writings have appeared in numerous newspapers and magazines in a number of countries and on international websites, as well as her scientific work. Several of her poems have been translated and/or selected for international poetry and art exhibitions and anthologies. She has been the focus of several videos and documentaries in various countries and interviewed periodically for multiple reasons in Spanish and English, from 1990 onwards. Zabaleta has coordinated and participated in several artistic activities at national and international level. She also founded and still coordinates the international network, 'Women and Arts in the World' as well as a Working Group of the Consejo Europeo de Investigaciones Sociales de Am√©rica Latina [European Council of Social Research on Latin America]. Since 1992, Zabaleta has been listed as a woman, scientist and author, in about 50 biographical books, the latest of which are The International Who's Who of Women\\" and \\"The International Who's Who of Authors and Writers (London & New York: Routledge, 2019). In 2003,Marta was also selected by the UNRC as a female political refugee who triunfed in Europe and invited to write her history. In 2005 she was selected among the 10 professional awarded help by the Council for Assisting Refugee Academics to take part in the Oral History of London because of her \\"valuable contribution to the culture of the city\\". Furthermore, her personal history and her opinions about relevant topics were taped over 10 hours and will remain open to the Museum of London's public permanently.

He replaced the ambassador Mohammad Reza Beg (in French sources; M√©h√©met Riza Beg) as the principal Safavid diplomat in France during the reign of king Sultan Husayn (1694-1722).  Name  Hagopdjan is a form derived from the name Hagop, commonly used at that time among Armenians from Persia. The preposition \\"di\\", which indicates affiliation, was adopted by Hagopdjan from Italian, as was done frequently among Armenian merchants of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The French struggled to write his name, and therefore called him Acoljean of Ritchan, Agop Jean or Agobian. On a document stored at the Chamber of Commerce of Marseilles, his signature is kept: Hagopdjan di Deritchan, which means Hagopdjan son of Deritchan. The name of his father, Deritchan, is rare. Biography In 1714, the then incumbent king (shah) of Safavid Iran, Sultan Husayn, decided to send to Louis XIV an embassy for the purpose of signing a diplomatic and trade treaty between the two nations. He chose to represent Mohammad Reza Beg, mayor of Yerevan as the new Safavid ambassador to France, and the leader of the mission. The journey of the ambassador to France would prove to be difficult, because he had to cross territory of the neighboring Ottoman Empire - Safavid Iran's arch rival, which was therefore hostile territory. The mayor of Yerevan chose Hagopdjan, of Armenian origin, who was the richest merchant of the city, to accompany as well as to protect him. After Mohammad Reza Beg returned to Yerevan in 1715, Hagopdjan remained in France as the Safavid consul. First, he remained a few weeks in Paris, where the regent Philippe d'Orl√©ans, gave him a thousand pounds for his stay. Some time later, he traveled to Marseille, arriving on December 2 1715, and returned to his post. His task was not easy and further complicated by the fact that the Safavid king, Sultan Husayn, did not ratify the treaty immediately. When he did, in 1722, the situation in Persia had become very chaotic and the country was on the brink of anarchy, with the dynasty being on the brink of being overthrown by rebellious Pashtuns from within the far eastern borders. Furthermore, the empire was enduring two major invasions at the same time as well; by the Safavids' arch rival the Ottoman Empire, as well as by the Russian Empire, the latter who invaded in June 1722. The consul was somewhat \\"forgotten\\" by the authorities of his country and had to be content to live on a meager pension from the king of France. He was brought to intervene with the Chamber of Commerce to enforce the tax privileges of the Persians in France. Hagopdjan de Deritchan died in Marseille on 25 August 1726 in poverty and oblivion.

In the 16th century, Spain colonized New Spain and took over the land from the indigenous peoples. Though it is now an independent nation, Mexico retains much of the cultural influence of Spain, including its official religion of Catholicism, the Spanish language, and the importance of machismo - the belief that men are superior to women. Mexico also retains much of the traditional beliefs of the indigenous peoples who first occupied the country. Besides Spanish, there are over one hundred different languages spoken in the country today. As a result, the current medical system involves a mix of traditional and Western medicinal techniques. Traditional beliefs such as Susto, also known as fear of illness, is thought to occur when the soul leaves the body and wanders. It is believed that women experience this more often than men. Empacho, or the dislocation of body functions is often associated with morning sickness in pregnancy because it is believed that the baby is bringing increased energy to the digestive process. Mal de Ojo is another important perceived cause of illness which relates to birth. It is believed that if someone is looked upon with admiration or jealousy that they will become ill themselves. In Mexico, approximately 46.2% are below the poverty line, the average life expectancy is 76.7 years, 73.9 years in males, and 79.6 years in females. 95.8% of the population is literate. In the country, the Infant mortality rate is low, compared to other countries, Mexico is 127 with 10.7 deaths to 1,000 births, the maternal mortality rate is also low, occupying number 108 compared to other countries with a ratio of 33 deaths to 100,000 live births. The contraceptive use rate in the country is about 66.9% a little high compared to other countries. Pregnancy Mexico contains a variety of indigenous groups, cultural influences, and socioeconomic situations which all affect health outcomes. However, amongst all groups, pregnancy is welcome. The majority of the unintended pregnancies end up in an abortion. Furthermore, there is little information on the sex education received by women from different socioeconomic classes and geographic regions, which may influence pregnancy behaviors and beliefs. Traditional culture believes that pregnancy is a sacred event. This belief carries over into the post-Colombian Catholic culture that is very prevalent in Mexico today. The traditional birth culture is shaped by the beliefs of a hot-cold balance within the body. This balance must be maintained throughout the pregnancy and delivery process. To ensure the balance, women will avoid \\"hot\\" foods during their pregnancy as the gestation is considered a \\"hot\\" event. Furthermore, women attempting to become pregnant are advised to avoid cold surfaces, like medical examination tables, as they are thought to promote sterility or infertility. A main differentiator of pregnancy behaviors is socioeconomic status. This will influence a woman's outlook on pregnancy, her level of care received during pregnancy and the lifestyle changes that she makes during this time. Women are encouraged to avoid strenuous work during pregnancy, and some are encouraged to leave work altogether in order to ensure a healthy pregnancy and birth. During pregnancy a majority of women will receive some form of prenatal care. The World Bank Data‚Äôs most recent statistic for the Mexican prenatal care stated that 98.5% of women were seeking some prenatal care, while 94.3% of the women receiving prenatal care had at least four visits to the doctor's office (2020). While a vast majority of women are receiving care, this is often not consistent and varies across socioeconomic class. Women of a higher socioeconomic class are more likely to seek care from a GP than their counterparts. Historically, women have been more likely to seek prenatal care later in their pregnancy, with many women not obtaining such care until the second trimester. Data that breaks down incidence of modern prenatal care needs to be collected. Besides maintaining the hot-cold balance and avoiding work, there are other lifestyle changes that a woman may take on during her pregnancy. Women are encouraged to walk frequently throughout their pregnancies and often talk to their mothers or grandmothers for comfort or advice. Strong familial support is tied to improved pregnancy outcomes as the family is traditionally very supportive of the pregnant woman.  Labor  Recently, the president of Mexico, Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador (AMLO), removed the use of the Seguro Popular (Popular Insurance). The health insurance was provided to all the Mexican citizens but was commonly used by low income citizens; Now the president provided the citizens with the use of the Institute of Health for Welfare (Spanish: Instituto de Salud para el Bienestar, INSABI). Access to care is restricted in many ways, and to such an extent that certain members of the population have access to forms of care and choices that others do not. Citizens that live in small towns or rural areas are least likely to receive proper health care because there are not a lot of hospitals available in the areas or they are not properly equipped. There are private healthcare institutions available for those who can afford them, and large public health institutions which can provide care without costs to those eligible to be enrolled in their programs. Maternal hospitals, public and private, are generally available in large cities, while general hospitals are also available in rural areas. Typically, the amount of days that women stay at the hospital after giving birth varies in every case. In 1987 more than 80% of births in Mexico took place under the care of traditional midwives and empirical midwives. There are two fundamental concepts in the traditional medicine practiced in Mexico; hot-cold duality and naturaleza (inherent nature): * Hot-cold duality‚Äî all illnesses, physical conditions, drinks, foods are either hot or cold. Pregnancy is considered a hot condition, where upon birth women lose heat and are at risk of becoming dangerously cold. * Naturaleza‚Äî encompasses all the characteristics and qualities that physically and spiritually comprise an individual. One can have a strong or weak nature, this is determined by the phases of the mother, and the nature of the parents. This nature can in turn, influence sexuality, family size, and a person's physical spiritual and temperamental characteristics. By extension, these things can affect one's pregnancy and birthing process (onset and length) Traditional midwives sometimes use hydrotherapy, there are two basic types described in the literature: * Temazcal (sweat bath)‚Äî used prenatally, postpartum, and sometimes during the intrapartum period. The bath uses herbs that have bacteriostatic, anti inflammatory and other therapeutic qualities * Vapor (steam bath)‚Äî also uses herbal infusions with the addition of essential oils. Laboring person will sit on a chair that is on top of a larger streaming container. Traditionalist midwives may sometimes also incorporate some of the following to help ease the process of labor: * Medicinal plants and animal substances, not just orally, but through external application like massage and poultices, as well as douching. * Sobada (therapeutic touch/massage); can be done prenatally to change position of fetus (can prevent problems with abnormal presentation), aid prolonged labor, and difficulty delivering placenta. * May invoke protector spirits (Virgin Mary or saints). They pray and call to these spirits to find reassurance and deal with the uncertainties surrounding pregnancy, birth, and puerperium (6-week period after childbirth where reproductive organs return to their original nonpregnant condition). * Use of oxytocic injections and administration of intravenous fluids to speed labor has become more widespread, even with traditional midwives. * It is believed that things like brujeria, mal aire, and susto can affect birth outcomes and the labor process. Sometimes red ribbon and clothes can be worn or used to prevent el mal de ojo. Policies surrounding labor vary from location and type of facility, so labor processes can vary amongst women geographically and by socioeconomic status. In large public hospitals women who birth there tend to have some sort of Psychoprophylaxis class (Lamaze technique) before going into labor. The Lamaze classes help women to prepare them for labor, they are taught techniques in preparation for childbearing without the use of anesthesia. Techniques include education, psychological and physical conditioning, and breathing exercises. These classes are not necessarily hospital affiliated (i.e. they are taught outside of the hospital and obstetricians do not directly refer women to them, so there is not a wide attendance). Women often laboring in these hospitals will have epidurals or other forms of analgesia, if deemed necessary. Family members are not allowed in labor unless the family member has also taken Psychoprophylaxis courses. In privately ran hospitals, women will often get discharged 24hrs after vaginal delivery and 48hrs following a Cesarean. Standard practice is that all laboring women have intravenous lines, pubic hair is not routinely shaved, and all primiparas are given episiotomies. In these hospitals the father or other family members are required to be present during labor and birth (even for Cesareans), although only one member is allowed to be present because of space. Presence of support system (family members or father) is also encouraged at prenatal visits. During labor women are allowed to walk, drink juice (among other liquids). Babies must remain with their mother's postpartum because the only nursery available is meant for babies with low apgar scores and/or low temperatures, and even these babies are only kept under observation at the nursery for 3‚Äì4 hours. Sick babies, who have a birth condition, got sick at birth, or those who might need serious medical treatment are transferred to a children's hospital to receive better treatment. Most, if not all, neonates are breastfed. In local midwife practice, the homes the midwife would attend would often have no telephones, electricity, nor running water. She (the midwife) will bring an oxygen tank, Doppler unit, Pitocin and methergine in case of hemorrhage, herbal tinctures, suture material, bulb syringe among other things. She might also bring a car in case emergency transportation is necessary. During labor the midwife will massage the laboring person with oils and use hot compresses, and encourage walking and position changes to facilitate labor. Delivery will often happen in a semi sitting or squatting position. After the baby is born the midwife will stay with the mother and baby from 2 ‚Äì 4 hrs. She might use aceite de palo (plant oil extract) for the cord stump, which is to be applied with every diaper change to help disinfect and dry the cord rapidly. Birth Birth attendants can include a variety of providers, including general physicians (GP), obstetric nurses (ON), professional midwives (PM) and traditional birth attendants (TBA). ONs and PMs are not widely used in the hospital setting and physicians account for 87% of obstetric care in Mexico. The education and outcomes for each profession are outlined here. The WHO-supported competencies for skilled birth attendants are met 43% by GP education, 54% by ON education, and 89% by PM education. The ON is educated at the University level while the PM must have completed secondary education and then a 3-year midwifery education program. A 2011 study found that PMs often have improved outcomes compared to GPs and ONs, possibly due to their apprentice-like education. GPs and ONs are associated with higher use of episiotomy and oxytocin. TBAs have varying levels of education. ‚ÄòTraditional‚Äô TBAs tend to live in remote indigenous regions and their knowledge is passed down through oral tradition. Trained TBAs have typically attended some form of institutional training program. Unskilled TBAs lack the generational knowledge of indigenous TBAs and do not have the education of the trained TBAs. While the overall number of hospital births and physician-based obstetric care has increased in recent years, maternal mortality has not significantly changed. This is because in rural states, a little more than 40% of births still occur at home either with or without a skilled birth attendant; Mexico is one of the countries with the highest number of C-sections performed, with 30% more than recommended by the WHO. Additionally, rural clinics tend to be staffed by GPs or medical students, who often lack obstetric experience or expertise. Around of 53.1% of the institutional deliveries are vaginal, while 46.9% are by a C-section or were planned. Many doctors plan the delivery of the baby so they mother can be prepared and be on time at the hospital. In more traditional births, women are allowed to birth in whichever position is most comfortable for them, with many opting for a squatting position. In some cases, the spouse will hold the birthing woman as she pushes . Pain relief is variable amongst women, with rates of pharmaceutical analgesia being higher in institutional births. This is further outlined in the section regarding labor. After the infant is expelled from the body, a TBA may stand in between the mother's legs to prevent the heat of pregnancy escaping, which throws off the hot-cold balance. Once the placenta is delivered, it is typically set aside to be analyzed for completeness. Indication of a retained placenta can be cause for increased medical intervention. If the birth is taking place in a home, the birth attendant may bring the mother into a clinic or hospital in case of complication related to retained placenta. Traditionally, the placenta is buried at the home, with a male's placenta being buried under the porch and a female's being buried near the stove.  Postpartum  Postpartum visits will often include family planning and teaching; still there are some similar beliefs across the board about the harmful effects of contraceptives. Especially since fertility is highly valued among the culture, pregnancy is viewed as a gift from God. In traditional practice it is believed that the maternal postpartum diet should only include chicken, burned tortillas, coffee and atole (corn and flour based beverage), nothing of a cold nature is allowed. Shifts in modern medicine have a lot less restrictions, including a varied diet and milk. The biggest postpartum ritual in Mexico is the idea of the cuarentena (Postpartum confinement). This is a forty-day postpartum period of rest, where women are supposed to avoid bathing, intimacy, and remain in some ways secluded. Family relatives (especially female family relatives) are supposed to help with cooking, cleaning, and taking care of the mother's older children while she rests. Diet restrictions during cuarentena include no chili, spices, cold foods, fish, pork and citrus. This is a practice that can be traced to biblical times (Leviticus 12 from the bible, this practice continues to play on the Catholic influence on the population's overall culture). More midwives are teaching women to practice a prompt return to normal activity, instead of observing the cuarentena. Not observing the cuarentena was thought to lead to illness, infertility, infection and even death. In private hospitals, patients will be seen as soon as a week after discharge for a complete check up. They will have follow up family planning visits one month into the postpartum period, women are then encouraged to have annual vaginal exams after the cuarentena. IUDs (Intrauterine Devices) are the most popular forms of contraception, these will be inserted during these visits. Paternalism is a major cultural principle and practice that also plays out during postpartum visits because men tend to be very involved in the decision making of what kind of contraception may be used, if any. Newborns In Mexican culture, newborns are highly revered. The cuarentena period mentioned above is also largely for the newborn. The traditional cultural belief of \\"mal de ojo\\" is the main rationale behind this. It is believed that if the baby receives too much admiration from others, especially those outside of the family structure, that the baby will fall ill. For this reason, there are not any public ceremonies honoring the baby, though many families participate in a christening to thank God for the gift that they have been given. While the responsibility of caring for the newborn falls mainly on the mother, it is very common for the extended family to have a large part in child rearing. Often many families live in very close proximity, sometimes even in the same house as each other due to a strong emphasis placed on family values in Mexican culture. This transcends the nuclear family and extends into extended family. For example, the elders in the family are in charge of the care of the baby's umbilical stump. The stump is covered by a coin and then the abdomen is wrapped tightly in a cloth, which is often red, as the color red is thought to ward off bad spirits. This dressing is changed daily, as it is thought necessary to place an herbal blend on the stump to aide in healing and prevent infection. The concept of purity is important when taking care of newborns in Mexican culture, and therefore most babies are not breastfed; around of 14% of the Mothers breastfeed their newborns. Breastmilk is viewed as impure and unsafe. Babies are generally exclusively formula fed until two to three months at which time non-milk items are added to their diet. In Mexican culture, it is believed that in order to keep an infant pure of heart, and in turn healthy, they must never experience distress. For this reason, infants spend most of their time being held by a family member to prevent them from crying. As young newborns, they are also swaddled in blankets made by family members to make them feel safe. Co-sleeping and babywearing are also encouraged as they are thought to allow the infant to gain spiritual strength through their mother which will protect them from evil spirits and promote good health. In an effort to avoid upsetting the infant and putting them at risk of being impure, circumcision is discouraged in Mexico, 10% to 30% is estimated to be the prevalence of circumcision in the country, but many hospitals do not keep a record of their data. After the baby is born, their parents need to register the baby at the Civil Registry Office (Registro Civil); once the baby is registered, the parents will receive their birth certificate. Usually, the baby will be registered with their father's last name followed by their mother's last name. The birth certificate serves to have a record of the population and also it serves as an identification for the baby, that later will be needed to be able to register to their schools among other things. Unfortunately, many people are not registered, even that the service is free, because they do not have access to an office or they do not have the required documents to be able to complete the registration.

Murphy was ranked as a five star offensive tackle prospect by Rivals.com and a four star prospect by ESPN.com, ranked 27th overall in the country in the ESPN top 150. As such, he was highly recruited coming out of high school. He received scholarship offers from a large amount of division one schools including Stanford, Alabama, Arizona, Arizona State, Auburn, and California. He accepted visits from Stanford, Oregon, Florida, and USC. College career Murphy ultimately decided to play for the Stanford Cardinal. In his first year, he was one of three freshman lineman to play, starting in two games and playing in 14. He wore two jersey numbers, 78 for when on the line of scrimmage and 94 for when he was an eligible receiver. He averaged 25 snaps per game at tight end and offensive tackle. In his sophomore year, Murphy played in 13 games as offensive tackle and tight end. Murphy started all 13 games as right tackle in his junior year, where he was named to the All-Pac-12 second team, as well as Phil Steele's All-Pac-12 second team. Stanford's offensive line ranked 18th in the country in tackles for loss allowed and 42nd in sacks. In his final year with the Cardinal, he started all 14 games at left tackle and was named a team captain. His play earned him a spot on the watchlists for the Rotary Lombardi Award and the Outland Trophy. He finished the year by being named as a third team All- American by Phil Steele, and to a spot on the All-Pac-12 first team. Professional career =Green Bay Packers= Murphy was projected as a fifth or sixth round pick by Lance Zierlein of NFL.com. He stated that he had a good feel for his position and was aware in pass protection. He also mentioned that he had good pad level against the running back and did a good job of securing blocks. However, he also said that he had average quickness and that speed rushers gave him an issue. Additionally, there was concern that he was \\"antsy\\" before the snap and that game tape showed him starting early. Even though it was not called by college officials, this would create false start penalties at the professional level. Murphy was drafted in the sixth round with the 200th overall selection by the Green Bay Packers. Green Bay had drafted his long-time teammate Blake Martinez earlier in the draft in the fourth round. Blake later commented that after Murphy was drafted that he and his family \\"were going crazy at my house. It was awesome.\\" Murphy later commented that getting a call from the Packers was \\"extraordinary.\\" Murphy also noted that he was ready to play wherever the team asked him. On May 6, 2016, he signed a contract with the Packers. Murphy made his first career start in the 2017 season opener against the Seattle Seahawks at right tackle in place of the injured Bryan Bulaga, and the next two weeks at left tackle in place of the injured David Bakhtiari. On September 26, 2017, Murphy was placed on injured reserve after suffering a foot injury. On September 1, 2018, Murphy was placed on injured reserve. He was released on December 27, 2018. =Los Angeles Rams= On December 29, 2018, Murphy was signed to the Los Angeles Rams practice squad. He signed a reserve/future contract with the Rams on February 6, 2019. He was waived on April 16, 2019. =Houston Texans= On October 16, 2019, Murphy was signed to the Houston Texans practice squad. He signed a reserve/future contract with the Texans on January 13, 2020. On September 5, 2020, Murphy was released by the Texans. Personal life Murphy is the younger brother of former Minnesota Vikings offensive tackle Kevin Murphy.

He was active in the New York art scene in the 1960s and '70s. His paintings are best summarized as an exploration of space through color and structure. He lived and worked in New York, NY. He is not to be confused with the percussionist Ralph Humphrey, best known for being the drummer of The Mothers Of Invention from 1973 until 1974. Biography Ralph Humphrey studied at Youngstown State University. He moved to New York in 1957 and immediately became a part of the art scene that was known, at the time, for Abstract Expressionism. He met artists such as Mark Rothko, Theodoros Stamos, Frank Stella, Robert Ryman, and Ellsworth Kelly, who would end up having a large influence on his work. Humphrey was a prominent member of the generation of artists who laid the groundwork for American art in the 1970s and 60s. From 1966 until his death in 1990, he taught painting in the graduate department at Hunter College. Artistic style Humphrey's artistic style went through several phases and developments, which can be roughly outlined in the following way: monochromes from 1957‚Äì60; frame paintings 1961‚Äì65; shaped canvases 1967‚Äì70; constructed paintings 1971‚Äì1990. Throughout these phases, Humphrey kept a keen eye on color, light, and space while he moved between abstraction and representation. As Kenneth Baker explains in Art in America in 1984, ‚ÄúEach of his works defines an ideal viewing distance that can be discovered only by patient observation of the focus of the details, the resolution of the image and the proper relationship between body and object. Finding the apt distance from which to contemplate Humphrey‚Äôs new paints is thus not something you do discursively: it is an exercise in feeling your way silently towards a correct spatial interval.‚Äù =1957‚Äì1960= Reviewing Humphrey's show at Tibor de Nagy in 1960, Donald Judd said, of his monochromes, ‚ÄúThey are large, subtle and single-colored. This is Purism of a sort, in which generality does not contain variables but excludes them, in which the basic diagram or color, the only continuity, is exposed, here the essence of a confused sequence of perceptions.‚Äù Donald Judd also likened these canvases to the work of Kazimir Malevich, Piet Mondrian, and Josef Albers. =1961‚Äì1965= Neil A. Levine wrote in 1965 about Humphrey's solo exhibition at Green Gallery, where he showed some of his frame paintings. Levine said, ‚ÄúHis new work is serious and demanding. All the paintings are variations on one theme. The theme is, simply stated, an expansive, lightly brushed, large grey field‚Ä¶surrounded by a painted framing edge‚Ä¶‚Äù Here, Neil, too, references Albers, as well as TV screens, unfilled billboards, and Rothko. =1967‚Äì1970= Robert Pincus-Whitten reviewed Humphrey's 1969 show at Bykert Gallery, where his shaped canvases were hung. Pincus-Whitten explains how Humphrey created ‚Äúa luminous cosmos of fragile exhalations, painted on large squares or horizontal rectangles, softly turned at the corner and curved back into the stretcher.‚Äù These canvases are noteworthy, too, for their use of day- glow colors. At this time, his work becomes increasingly more atmospheric than his previous efforts; multi-colored wavy lines and sprayed colors replace solid geometric fields of single colors. =1971‚Äì1990= The last definable phase of his artistic style approaches representation at times, sometimes calling to mind an open window. These constructed paintings also border on sculpture, often coming ten inches out from the wall, directly confronting the viewer in real space. The paint, too, is considerably built up, giving the surface of the paintings considerable texture that was not previously seen in his work. Ellen Schwartz writes in 1977 about his show at John Weber, where his constructed paintings were still abstract: ‚ÄúHumphrey‚Äôs latest works, meditative rather than communicative, require the suspension of conscious efforts to grasp them before they will yield their secrets, which lay within ourselves all the while. The rich blue variegated surfaces are like blotters onto which we pour our own fantasies.‚Äù D Phillips, writing about his Willard Gallery show in 1982, explains how his constructed paintings are natural extensions of the earlier frame paintings: ‚ÄúFrames-within-frames have long provided the structural basis for Humphrey‚Äôs colorful designs; he has simply made his window allusion literal.‚Äù She explains, too, that these paintings are a step forward: ‚ÄúThe shift does, however, bring greater variety and complexity to the artist‚Äôs constructions. There is a more explicit sense of space, of indoors and outdoors.‚Äù Beyond content, we see Humphrey using a brighter color palette and inserting vaguely figurative, whimsical patterns onto the surface. Yet, by the mid 1980s, the paintings return to a more ambiguous, abstract state. Exhibitions Since his first solo exhibition at the Tibor de Nagy Gallery in New York City in 1959, Humphrey's work has been the subject of 40 solo shows. During his lifetime, he had been represented by Green Gallery, Bykert Gallery, Andre Emmerich Gallery, Willard Gallery, and John Weber Gallery. Solo exhibitions have continued to be mounted since his death in 1990, including Ralph Humphrey: Frame Paintings, 1964 to 1965 at Mary Boone Gallery, New York City, September 8‚ÄìOctober 6, 1990 and Ralph Humphrey: Conveyance at Gary Snyder Gallery, April 2 ‚Äì May 16, 2015. Other exhibitions have been held elsewhere in New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Boston. Humphrey's paintings have also been in group shows such as Systemic Painting at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, 1966, The Structure of Color at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, 1971, the 1979 Biennial at the Whitney Museum, and High Times, Hard Times: New York Painting, 1967-1975 at the Weatherspoon Art Museum, 2006. =Solo exhibitions= 1959 *Ralph Humphrey, Tibor de Nagy Gallery, New York, February 3‚Äì21 1960 *Ralph Humphrey, Tibor de Nagy Gallery, New York, February 2‚Äì21 1961 *Ralph Humphrey: Recent Paintings, Mayer Gallery, New York, March 14 ‚Äì April 1 1965 *Ralph Humphrey, Green Gallery, New York, May 5‚Äì29 1967 *Ralph Humphrey, Bykert Gallery, New York, January 10 ‚Äì February 24 1968 *Ralph Humphrey, Bykert Gallery, New York, February 3‚Äì29 1969 *Ralph Humphrey, Bykert Gallery, New York, February 1‚Äì27 Galerie Alfred Schmela, D√ºsseldorf 1970 *Ralph Humphrey, Bykert Gallery, New York, April 4‚Äì25 1971 *Ralph Humphrey, Andr√© Emmerich Gallery, New York, March 20 ‚Äì April 8 1972 *Ralph Humphrey, Bykert Gallery, New York, May 2‚Äì23 1973 *Ralph Humphrey, Bykert Gallery, New York, May 12 ‚Äì June 2 *Ralph Humphrey: Survey of Paintings, Texas Gallery, Houston, May 15 ‚Äì June 9 1974 *Ralph Humphrey, Bykert Gallery, New York, April 20 ‚Äì May 15 *Ralph Humphrey: Paintings, Daniel Weinberg Gallery, San Francisco, November‚ÄìDecember 1975 *Ralph Humphrey: Paintings, 1974, Bykert Gallery, New York, February 4‚Äì26 *Ralph Humphrey: Paintings, 1958‚Äì1966, Bykert/ Downtown, New York, February 4‚Äì26 1976 *Ralph Humphrey, John Weber Gallery, New York, January 31 ‚Äì February 25 1976‚Äì1977 *Ralph Humphrey: Recent Paintings, Daniel Weinberg Gallery, San Francisco, December 16, 1976 ‚Äì January 22, 1977 1977 *Ralph Humphrey, John Weber Gallery, New York, February 9‚Äì26 1980 *Ralph Humphrey, Willard Gallery, New York, April 5 ‚Äì May 7 1982 *Ralph Humphrey, Willard Gallery, New York, April 3‚ÄìMay 8 *Ralph Humphrey: Paintings, 1975‚Äì1982, Daniel Weinberg Gallery, Los Angeles, October 6‚Äì30 1983 *Ralph Humphrey: Selected Paintings, Daniel Weinberg Gallery, Los Angeles, May 14 ‚Äì June 11 1984 *Delahunty Gallery, Dallas *Ralph Humphrey, Willard Gallery, New York, April 7 ‚Äì May 12 1985 *Ralph Humphrey: Recent Paintings, Daniel Weinberg Gallery, Los Angeles, October 16 ‚Äì November 2 1987 *Ralph Humphrey, Jay Gorney Modern Art, New York, January‚ÄìFebruary 1990 *Ralph Humphrey: 1990, Mary Boone Gallery, New York, March 3‚Äì31 *Ralph Humphrey: Frame Paintings, 1964 to 1965, Mary Boone Gallery, New York, September 8‚ÄìOctober 6 *Ralph Humphrey: A Retrospective View, 1954‚Äì1990, Daniel Weinberg Gallery, Los Angeles, November 8‚Äì December 5 1991 *Ralph Humphrey: The Late Paintings on Paper, Bertha and Karl Leubsdorf Art Gallery, Hunter College, City University of New York, September 19 ‚Äì October 26 *Ralph Humphrey: Paintings, 1975‚Äì1985, John Berggruen Gallery, San Francisco, October‚ÄìNovember 1996 *Ralph Humphrey: Selected Paintings, Daniel Weinberg Gallery, San Francisco, August 17 ‚Äì October 17 1998 *Ralph Humphrey, Danese Gallery, New York, January 16 ‚Äì February 14 2000 *Ralph Humphrey: Early Paintings, 1957‚Äì1967, Daniel Weinberg Gallery, Los Angeles, November 1 ‚Äì December 9 2001 *Ralph Humphrey: Later Paintings, 1975‚Äì1982, Daniel Weinberg Gallery, Los Angeles, April 5 ‚Äì May 26 2008 *Ralph Humphrey: Selected Works from the Estate, Nielsen Gallery, Boston, May 17 ‚Äì June 14 *Ralph Humphrey: Selected Paintings, 1957‚Äì1980, Daniel Weinberg Gallery, Los Angeles, May 31 ‚Äì June 28 2012 *Ralph Humphrey, Gary Snyder Gallery, New York, September 13 ‚Äì October 27 2015 *Ralph Humphrey: Conveyance, Garth Greenan Gallery, New York, April 2‚ÄìMay 16 =Group Exhibitions= 1961 *American Abstract Expressionists and Imagists, Solomon R.

A student of both the dakini Yeshe Tsogyal and the great master Padmasambhava, the co-founders of Tibetan Buddhism. He is known for being one of Yeshe Tsogyal's main consorts along with Padmasambhava, and for writing one of Yeshe Tsogyal's biographies. Born into a poor family, Atsara Sal√© was sold into slavery and taken to Bhaktapur, Nepal where he was sold again into the service of a powerful noble family. At the instruction of Padmasambhava, Yeshe Tsogyal traveled to Nepal to find Atsara Sale, her predicted consort.Keith Dowman, ‚Äò‚ÄôSky Dancer: The Secret Life and Songs of the Lady Yeshe Tsogyal‚Äô‚Äô, Routledge and Kegan Paul (1984, p. 44)The same account is also found in Gyalwa Changchub and Namkhai Nyingpo, ‚Äò‚ÄôLady of the Lotus-Born: The Life and Enlightenment of Yeshe Tsogyal‚Äô‚Äô, Shambhala (1999, p. 45) He accompanied Yeshe Tsogyal for the remainder of his life, and together they undertook extensive spiritual retreat practices and karmamudra practices in Nepal, Tibet, and Bhutan. History What is known of the life and spiritual attainments of Atsara Sal√© come from the biographies of Yeshe Tsogyal. In 795ce, Yeshe Tsogyal traveled to Nepal to meet Atsara Sale, her prophesied consort to offer support on the path of spiritual maturation. As Padmasambhava exhorted Yeshe Tsogyal, After raising enough money to buy his contract from his owners,Keith Dowman, ‚Äò‚ÄôSky Dancer: The Secret Life and Songs of the Lady Yeshe Tsogyal‚Äô‚Äô, Routledge and Kegan Paul (1984, pp. 50-54)Gyalwa Changchub and Namkhai Nyingpo, ‚Äò‚ÄôLady of the Lotus-Born: The Life and Enlightenment of Yeshe Tsogyal‚Äô‚Äô, Shambhala (1999, pp. 49-54) Yeshe Tsogyal and Atsara Sale then returned together to Tibet. Along the way, they went to some of the caves famous for being places where Padmasambhava practiced meditation with his consorts, including the meditation caves of Asura and YangleshoYanglesh√∂ cave (Wyl. yang le shod kyi brag phug), in Pharping, near Kathmandu. and there met and practiced with Belmo Sakya Dema,also known as Belwong Kalasiddhi, Bal-dbang Kalasiddhi, or just Kalasiddhi Padmasambhava's Nepali consort.Keith Dowman, ‚Äò‚ÄôSky Dancer: The Secret Life and Songs of the Lady Yeshe Tsogyal‚Äô‚Äô, Routledge and Kegan Paul (1984, p. 54) At one point, during one of his retreats with Yeshe Tsogyal, at Tidro, Atsara Sal√© is said to have left her alone in their isolated retreat cave once he realized that the religious practice she was embarking upon were far more advanced than he was capable of undertaking and also that the very cold winter was more than he could tolerate.Keith Dowman, ‚Äò‚ÄôSky Dancer: The Secret Life and Songs of the Lady Yeshe Tsogyal‚Äô‚Äô, Routledge and Kegan Paul (1984, p. 69) Some versions of the story say that he did indeed leave their join retreat to serve as one of Padmasambhava's attendants, yet he had thought there were ample provisions for Yeshe Tsogyal to continue on alone.

Yeshe Tsogyal was a renowned Vajrakilaya practitioner and it is likely that he received these teachings from her or directly from Padmasambhava.

He attended Atlantic High School in Delray Beach, Florida. He played college football at Virginia Tech, and was drafted by the Kansas City Chiefs in the sixth round of the 2016 NFL Draft. Early years Nicolas was born on September 29, 1992 in Port-au- Prince, Haiti to mother Esperanta Estime. He grew up in Florida and did not begin playing football until his senior year, instead lettering in basketball. During that year he played for Head Coach Chris Bean at Atlantic High School and had 70 tackles, 11 sacks, four forced fumbles, and two pass break-ups. He was named to the Honorable mention all-area selection by The Palm Beach Post. He was not highly recruited coming out of high school and enrolled at Virginia Tech on July 6, 2011. College career Nicolas began his career with the Virginia Tech Hokies by receiving a redshirt designation while training at the defensive end position. He had a 38-inch vertical jump and ran a 4.63 40 yard dash time. During the annual spring scrimmage, he had four tackles with three for a loss. During May of that year Nicolas was arrested in relation to a bike stolen from the campus dining hall and charged with felony second-degree grand larceny and was indefinitely suspended from the team. He was reinstated to the team on August 30 of that year after the charges were reduced to misdemeanor petty larceny, to which Nicolas plead not guilty. He began his first year of eligibility by receiving the Richard Bullock award for most improved player on the defense in spring practice. During a conference game against the Duke Blue Devils, he had one sack and a forced fumble. Overall, he played in 10 games, 123 snaps on defense and nine on special teams and recorded 17 tackles, 3.5 for a loss, and 2 sacks. He also had one forced fumble and one recovery. In his sophomore year with the Hokies, Nicolas played in all 13 games that year and started in one of them. During spring training, he broke the program's positional record with a 41-inch vertical. He was awarded the Coaches Award on the defense. He started out the season with a sack in the opener against the Alabama Crimson Tide. During a game later that year in a game against Pittsburgh he had a career-high three sacks. Additionally, he had an interception against Duke. He finished off the year playing 377 snaps, 313 on defense, one on offense, and 63 on special teams. He had four sacks, 32 tackles, seven tackles for lass, and 13 quarterback hurries. He was named as an honorable mention All-American by College Football News. Beginning his junior year, Nicolas was awarded the President's award for most outstanding leadership in spring practice. He started all 13 games that year. During the second game of the year, he had two sacks against Ohio State and was named the ACC Defensive Lineman of the Week for his efforts. During a game against Pittsburgh, he blocked a field goal. During the game against Duke, he had two and a half sacks and five hurries and was again named the ACC Defensive Lineman of the week. His efforts earned him a second-team All-ACC selection. In his final year with Virginia Tech, Nicolas spent the majority of it rehabilitating a hand that was broken during spring training, an injury that he played with in the regular season. In addition, he had jammed fingers in his left hand. His condition lead to him being called \\"Lobster Boy\\" by Line Coach Charles Wiley. Later on in the season, he was suspended for half of the annual rivalry game against the University of Virginia. This suspension stemmed from an incident in which Nicolas made contact with referee Ron Cherry following a penalty being declared on him. Nicolas claimed in the press conference after that it was not intentional. He finished the season with 45 tackles with seven for loss and 2.5 sacks. He was named to the 2015 All-ACC Third Team by the Conference Coaches. Professional career Nicolas was projected by NFL.com and CBS Sports as a mid to late round pick. Lance Zierlein of NFL.com commented that he had quick pass rush moves that can catch slower players off guard. He also complimented his athletic ability and burst to make up ground when chasing ball carriers. However, he was concerned by his lack of strength and size, noting he would probably not continue on the defensive line in the NFL. He also noted he tended to avoid contact, and that he had poor instincts covering the run. Dane Brugler and Rob Rang of CBS Sports also commented on his athleticism and speed, and also commented he was a good special teams player. However, they also noted he did not have the strength and did not believe him to be a point of attack player. They projected him to be an outside linebacker in a 4‚Äì3 scheme as opposed to a defensive end. =Kansas City Chiefs= Nicolas was drafted by the Kansas City Chiefs in the 28th pick of the sixth round, 203rd overall. Adam Teicher of ESPN.com commented that he was too light to play on the defensive line and he'd have to add some weight to be a viable outside linebacker. He commented that he would possibly end up on the practice squad as a rookie. During the rookie minicamp that year, Nicolas commented that playing in the NFL was \\"very different\\" and that he was able to understand the game better than he did in college. He also mentioned he wanted to put on more weight and that he believed he had \\"great potential\\" at his new position. The Chiefs believed they could use him at the linebacker position while Justin Houston continued recovery from ACL surgery. Nicolas was placed on injured reserve on January 4, 2017 after suffering a ruptured patellar tendon. On September 2, 2017, Nicolas was placed on the physically unable to perform list to start the 2017 season due to the injury suffered in January. Nicolas was traded to the Cleveland Browns on May 2, 2018, in exchange for tight end Randall Telfer. However two days later, the trade was called off and voided without an explanation given from either team. Nicolas was waived by the Chiefs days later. =Seattle Seahawks= On May 16, 2018, Nicolas signed with the Seattle Seahawks. He was waived on June 14, 2018. =Washington Redskins= Nicolas signed with the Washington Redskins on August 1, 2018.

On August 20, 2019, he was waived. =Denver Broncos= On August 21, 2019, Nicolas was claimed off waivers by the Denver Broncos. He was waived/injured on August 31, 2019, and placed on injured reserve. He was waived from injured reserve on September 24. =Calgary Stampeders= Nicolas signed with the Calgary Stampeders of the CFL on April 16, 2020.

Biography Born in Plainfield, New London County, Connecticut Colony, Fellows settled in Sheffield, Province of Massachusetts around 1750. He fought in the French and Indian Wars. During the Revolution he was present during the British Siege of Boston under George Washington. After the battles of Lexington and Concord he led a regiment to Boston and fought at the Battle of Bunker Hill. In August 1776, Fellows commanded a brigade at the Battle of Long Island covering Washington's retreat after the loss.Barnard & Guyot, 1890, p. 8 Fellows commanded a regiment in the Massachusetts Militia at Roxbury, Massachusetts until the end of 1775. On June 25, 1776, he was appointed by the Massachusetts General Court to be brigadier general of the militia reinforcements which was being assembled to support the Continental Army at New York City.U.S. National Archives On September 15, 1776 the British General William Howe landed a large force of troops at Kips Bay on the East River near what is now 34th street in NYC. Feeble defense by the American militia of General Parsons and General Fellows soon ended in a rout of American forces. The failure to stop and oppose the enemy was a great disappointment to Washington. General Washington was said to be so distraught at seeing the rout, that he drew his sword and charged down the hill towards the advancing British forces, only to be restrained by an aide at the last moment. His army narrowly escaped annihilation. Fellows also commanded troops at the battle of Battle of White Plains, the Battle of Long Island and in the Saratoga campaign. A resident of Massachusetts, Fellows belonged to the Provincial Congress of Massachusetts. Fellows helped in the development and settlement at Canandaiga, New York. In 1790 he built the first saw mill at Mud Creek, East Bloomfield, New York in 1790. The 1790 census shows him living in Ontario County, New York. Fellows was also the Sheriff of Berkshire County, Massachusetts for many years. Fellows was appointed proprietor of the town of Wolcott, Vermont.Vermont Historical Gazetteer, Vol 2, page 778.

He was a close aide to Edward J. King beginning during their days at the Massachusetts Port Authority. Early life Hanley was born in Mission Hill to Irish immigrants. His father was a taxicab driver. During his youth, Hanley sold peanuts at Fenway Park and attended Mission Hill Grammar School. He credited the School Sisters of Notre Dame, who ran the Mission Hill Grammar School, for his drive to seek a way out of poverty. During World War II, Hanley served in the United States Navy. He also worked as a bartender in Mission Hill. During this time, he met Theresa Connors, a nursing student. The couple married in 1956 would have eight children, one of whom died during infancy. After the war, Hanley attended Bentley's School of Accounting and Finance (now Bentley University) on the G.I. Bill and became a certified public accountant. In 1958 earned a business degree from Boston College. He then attended Boston College Law School at night. He got his law degree in 1962 and passed the bar that same year. Massachusetts Port Authority In 1953, Hanley met Edward J. King, a fellow accountant at Lybrand, Ross Brothers & Montgomery (now PricewaterhouseCoopers). In 1960, when King became secretary-treasurer of the Massachusetts Port Authority, Hanley joined him as comptroller. When King was promoted to executive director in 1963, Hanley succeeded him as secretary- treasurer. During their tenure at Massport, King and Hanley worked on immensely expanding Boston's Logan Airport. Hanley was praised by Massport board member John Larkin Thompson for his management of the port authority's financial affairs. When King was fired by the Massachusetts Port Authority Board of Directors in 1974, Hanley served as interim executive director for several months before leaving to start a private tax law practice with John J. Egan, the father-in-law of King's brother. He was also appointed to the board of directors of Catholic Charities USA and Blue Shield of Massachusetts. Secretary of Administration and Finance When King was elected governor in 1978, Hanley left his lucrative law practice to accept the lower paying job of Secretary of Administration and Finance. Hanley was King's first appointment as Governor. During his tenure in King's cabinet, Hanley was seen as being King's closest advisor, earning him the informal title of \\"deputy governor\\". He received praise for accurate revenue projections and for being an even- tempered but tough financial manager during the turmoil that came after Proposition 2¬Ω was adopted. However, he was criticized for not being able to cut enough from the state budget to achieve King's campaign promise of rolling taxes back by $500 million. He was also charged with having alienated the Governor's base by drawing out contract negations with labor unions. He was further criticized by his fellow cabinet members for having a negative attitude and for sitting in on their meetings with King. In November 1981, it was reported that Hanley would resign from the cabinet due to his concern over the state of his tax business following Egan's death. He resigned from the cabinet later that year in order to return to the practice. Massachusetts Turnpike Authority On June 30, 1980, Hanley changed his political registration from Democratic to Unenrolled. This was seen as an indication that he would be appointed to the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority (only two members of the commission could be of the same political party and two of the incumbent members were registered Democrats). The move came exactly two years before the term of associate commissioner Raymond Fontana was to expire. On September 28, 1982, Hanley was appointed to an eight-year term on the board. For six of the years he was on the board, Hanley served as its vice chairman. During his tenure, Hanley opposed Turnpike Authority using its bonding power to finance the Central Artery/Tunnel Project (better known as the Big Dig). In 1989, Hanley resigned due to frustration over what he viewed as an unqualified patronage appointment. Later life and death During his adult life, Hanley and his family resided in Westwood, Massachusetts. He also owned a summer home in Mashpee, Massachusetts for forty years. Hanley died in Westwood on June 12, 2007 following a long illness.

It did not reach production, despite an attempt to interest the USAAC in it as a trainer, but it appeared in three Hollywood films. Design The Aeroneer 1-B was initially developed by the Aero Engineering Corp, which named it. Its later development was taken up by the Phillips Aviation Company, so it appears as the Aeroneer 1-B in contemporary publications, though later sources may refer to it as the Phillips Aeroneer 1-B. The Aeroneer is a low wing cantilever design. Its wing is in five separate parts: a short span, rectangular centre section, trapezoidal panels over most of the span and rounded tips. The outer panels carry some dihedral. It is built around a single spar placed at 30% chord. Torsional loads are resisted by a torsion box formed by the riveted Alclad skin that covers the whole wing and an auxiliary spar at 65% chord. Its ailerons are metal framed but fabric covered, mounted on piano hinges from the upper surface. Split flaps with an area of run under the trailing edge from aileron to aileron. The engine is a Menasco C-4, an air-cooled, inverted four-cylinder inline, though other Menasco engines could also have been fitted. The fuselage is all-metal, Aclad skinned and stiffened, though immediately behind the engine and around the cockpit the structure is reinforced with chrome-molybdenum steel tubes. The enclosed cockpit, under a sliding canopy and seating two side-by-side with dual controls, is over the wing. The empennage is conventional, with the tailplane set at mid-fuselage; its elevators are balanced and fitted with trim tabs. The fin is straight-edged but the short, broad, balanced rudder is curved. The Aeroneer has a tailwheeel undercarriage. Its mainwheels are on parallel, forward-raked oleo strut legs. The wheels have hydraulic brakes and both they and the legs are faired-in. The tailweheel, also fitted with a shock absorber, is free to caster. Floats or skis can replace wheels. Development The date of the Aeroneer's first flight is not known but by February 1937 it had completed \\"extensive tests\\" and was \\"ready for production\\". Nonetheless, it did not receive its Approved Type Certificate until the summer of 1938. In the absence of civil orders, Phillips slightly increased the span as well its power, in the hope that USAAC would order it as a basic trainer. A Menasco B-6 six-cylinder inline installation was planned, though another six-cylinder, inverted inline, a Ranger 6-410, was finally installed. Operational history No order was placed and the Aeroneer may have been sold to MGM; it appears in several films including The House Across the Bay (1940), where it took the r√¥le of the Crane X-PT, Power Dive (1941), and Sky Raiders (1941). The Aeroneer is reported to have survived in storage in Arizona until at least 2005. In 2007 it was advertised as for sale and its current state is unknown.

Background The authors said they interviewed 500 people in connection with their research. Gerth maintained that some had to remain unnamed because they \\"feared retribution from Senator Clinton or her staff\\" otherwise. The book came out at the same time as another mainstream biography, Carl Bernstein's A Woman in Charge: The Life of Hillary Rodham Clinton. The respective publishers moved up the release dates in the act of competition; the Bernstein one came out first by three days. Contents The chapters of the book are organized into three Parts: First Partner, First Lady, and First Woman. Political impacts The act of publishing occurred while the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2008 was underway. According to reviewers at the Washington Post, the Clinton campaign was \\"nervous\\" about new revelations from this or the Bernstein book. But the Clintons had a special antipathy towards Her Way due to the Gerth's role in the Whitewater, which had bedeviled them for much of the Bill Clinton administration. Once the books came out, while there were many items of interest, there were no blockbusters that would constitute political damage. A Clinton spokesman said, \\"Is it possible to be quoted yawning?\\" and that, \\"these books are nothing more than cash for rehash.\\" Media Matters for America questioned Jeff Gerth's status as an expert on the Clintons, writing that \\"among mainstream reporters, perhaps nobody during the 1990s got more things wrong about Hillary and Bill Clinton than Jeff Gerth.\\" The general consensus was that the Gerth-Van Natta book was a little on the negative side towards its subject while the Bernstein effort was a little on the positive side, but that both were mainstream works. As the Washington Post wrote, \\"Unlike many harsh books about Clinton written by ideological enemies, the two new volumes come from long-established writers backed by major publishing houses and could be harder to dismiss.\\" Critical response Many critics reviewed this and the Bernstein book in tandem. Reviews for Her Way were generally mixed. Reviewing the book for the New York Times, historian Robert Dallek asserted, \\"The book is almost uniformly negative and overly focused on what [the authors] consider the Clintons' scandalous past and the darker aspects of Clinton's personality.\\" He concluded that the Bernstein work was more neutral. (The unusually harsh review had been assigned to an outsider per normal Times practice when their staff were the authors.) Professor Linda Colley of the London Review of Books said that the book's heavy use of unnamed sources was problematic but that the authors \\"offer sharp analyses of some of Hillary‚Äôs recent speeches and public statements.\\" Several reviewers noted that Her Way had a detailed, lengthy account of Clinton's Senate career, an area where the Bernstein book was clearly lacking. New Yorker writer Elizabeth Kolbert saw the authors struggling to come up with new negative material on their subject. Kolbert illustrated with a case in point: \\"Take the hitherto untold story of Lee Telega, a Cornell University extension employee who worked in Clinton‚Äôs Washington office for six months, guiding the new senator on agricultural policy. Gerth and Van Natta go to great lengths to prove that Clinton's office never filed the required paperwork for Telega. The result? Apparently, Senator Clinton is guilty of receiving unauthorized dairy-farming advice.\\" Promotion and sales Her Way had a first printing of 175,000 copies. It was promoted by an initial installment in the New York Times, but a second installment was scrubbed. The authors also conducted many media interviews. Attempting to capitalize on the Clintons' dislike of the authors, the book's promotional tagline was: \\"The Book She Doesn't Want You to Read\\". Initial sales of the book were slow, with Nielsen BookScan reporting only 7,000 copies sold in its first ten days (about a third of what the Bernstein book was doing and far less than Clinton's 2003 autobiography Living History). It did not appear on the New York Times Best Seller List.http://www.hawes.com/2007/2007.htm Hawes Publications Adult New York Times Best Seller Lists for 2007 A CBS News end- of-year survey of publishing hits and misses included Her Way in the latter category and implied that its total sales were maybe around 20,000 copies.

His film career, spanning four decades, has also brought laurels and recognition to Assam. His first independent celluloid depiction, Aranya (1971), was based on the dwindling rhinoceros population in Assam. It brought him the National Award in the best feature film category (regional) in 1971. During 1970s to 1980s Samarendra Narayan Dev made more women centric films. Aranya 1971, and Putalar Ghar 1976, represented women of different social strata. While in Aranya, Bidya Rao played a carefree woman's character. Putalar Ghar represented the childlike innocence in a young woman and her transitions in life from childhood to adult age.  Early life  Samarendra Narayan Dev, the descendant of Darrang Royal Family was born on 13 October 1940 at Mangaldai in Darrang District of Assam.

The book makes the argument that Zionist leaders collaborated with fascism, particularly in Nazi Germany, in order to build up a Jewish presence in Palestine. One edition of the book features on its cover a medal struck by Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels to commemorate a visit by Leopold von Mildenstein of the Nazi SS elite corps to Palestine as a guest of the Zionist Federation of Germany. Zionism in the Age of the Dictators is one of two works by Brenner on the alleged collaboration between Zionism and Nazism. Brenner returns to this topic in his 2002 work 51 Documents: Zionist Collaboration with the Nazis. Reception Upon its initial publication the book received a positive review in The Times, with Edward Mortimer describing it as \\"crisp and carefully documented\\". However, C. C. Aronsfeld was critical in a review published in the journal International Affairs, stating that \\"Brenner has produced a party political tract that unhinges the balance of history by ignoring too many difficulties, especially psychological. For once Stalinists will be pleased with the work of a Trotskyist\\".See International Affairs, Vol 60, No. 1, (Winter 1983‚Äì1984), pp. 138‚Äì139 In the wake of the controversy regarding Ken Livingstone's comments on Adolf Hitler and Zionism in 2016 (see below), the book attracted further critical comment. Social historian David Rosenberg argues that Zionism in the Age of the Dictators is \\"badly written and with poor scholarship ‚Äì a piece of tabloid journalism glued together with selective facts and lots of conjecture\\". Brenner has stated that American publishing houses were not willing to print his work due to its controversial nature, and that his publishers (Croom Helm Ltd.) \\"gave [him] an ultimatum\\", saying \\"You are about to write the most controversial book imaginable ... So there can be no mistakes. You must send us a photocopy of every document you quote.\\" Thomas Weber, a professor of history and international affairs, argues that \\"Brenner's book lies well outside academic mainstream. It is mostly celebrated either by the extreme left and by the neo- Nazi right\\"; among others, the Institute for Historical Review ‚Äì defined by the Southern Poverty Law Center as an extremist neo-Nazi organisation promoting Holocaust denial ‚Äì has cited the book in their research. However, Brenner has criticised and condemned the use of his work by neo-Nazi Holocaust deniers. Socialist writer Gerry Ben-Noah wrote a critical review in the pamphlet Workers' Liberty. Ben-Noah argues that Brenner \\"creates a fantasy world in which the Zionists did wish for and expect the Holocaust, and in which the most fanatical Jewish nationalists were in reality, ardent anti- semites\\". Highly critical of the argument that \\"Zionists saw anti-semites as nationalists like themselves with a common objective in the removal of Jews from Europe\\", Ben-Noah asks rhetorically \\"where does one begin to review work like this?\\". Ken Livingstone controversy Zionism in the Age of the Dictators was mentioned in relation to a controversy in the United Kingdom when in 2016 the former Mayor of London Ken Livingstone said that Hitler had supported Zionism in the 1930s. Livingstone argued that Zionism in the Age of the Dictators \\"confirms there was clearly an ongoing dialogue [between Zionists and Nazis] even if the Israeli government now tries to pretend that none of that all happened\\". Following these remarks Livingstone was suspended from the Labour Party and indicated he intends to use Brenner's work when appealing his suspension.

BirSilgiBirKalem does not allow cash donations to be requested or made through its platform and does not interfere with the donation process.  History  BirSilgiBirKalem was founded in 2012 by Onur Aydin, a Harvard Business School MBA with a passion for social entrepreneurship and non-profits aimed at education. Onur and his colleagues often donated goods to schools across Turkey with their own money and realized that many other people who want to do so do not find the time or make the effort to donate as the process itself is very difficult. Onur envisioned a two-sided platform for individuals to connect directly with classrooms in need, providing materials requested by teachers. With the help of his friends and funding from Turkish Philanthropy Funds, he had the first version of the site built in 2012 and started to spread the word. Throughout 2012-2013, BirSilgiBirKalem was featured in several national newspapers of Turkey ( including Milliyet, Radikal and Hurriyet ) and several TV shows and news. The press coverage helped BirSilgiBirKalem get traction slowly, albeit the growth was not fast enough. BirSilgiBirKalem continued to receive attention in social media. As the number of schools and donors grew, the organization was recognized and awarded for its original solution to a major problem by Ashoka, Sabancƒ± Foundation and several other organizations. In 2015, Google for Non- Profits selected BirSilgiBirKalem as one of the non-profits it will support in Turkey. As a result of this free advertising support, BirSilgiBirKalem finally took off. The donations in 2015 alone were bigger than the sum of all donation of the previous three years. As of Jan 2017, donors have contributed over 1.5 million ( of which close 1M came in 2015 ) to help more than 100.000 students across Turkey.  Donation Process  = Schools = Verified teachers create a profile for their institution and provide visuals and brief information about their schools and requests. Every school is required to register using the verified credentials provided by the Turkish Ministry of Education and then is allowed to make donation in-kind requests. Following the completion of a donation, once the school receives the goods donated, teacher is required to provide evidence that the donations are used for educational purposes by taking pictures of the students with the products and submitting a letter addressing the donor, written preferably by students. = Donors = The donors may choose to purchase the goods they want to donate offline or online. BirSilgiBirKalem directs the contributors to various online shopping sites with different price and product range. Following the donation, the donors can monitor of the progress of their donation through the website. Every donor receives a letter from the relevant institution after the donation reaches the school and the students.  Collaboration  BirSilgiBirKalem is funded by Turkish Philanthropy Funds (tpfund.org) and through the support of its website members. BirSilgiBirKalem is supported by Google for Non-Profits and receives USD 10K adwords credits every month to fuel its growth. Yurtici Kargo, Turkey's largest courier company, is also a supporter and provides discounted prices to BirSilgiBirKalem donors.

Early life Zella Allen was born on August 10, 1858 in Zanesville, Ohio to Josiah Buffet Allen and Mary Caroline Blandy Allen.\\"Dixson, Zella Allen\\" entry In 1880, she graduated from Mount Holyoke College.Stauffer, pg. 102. She married Joseph Ehrman Dixson in 1881 and was soon after widowed in 1885. She began working as an assistant to Melvil Dewey at Columbia College library not long after her husband's death and was one of Dewey's students in library science. Career In 1886, Dixson traveled around the Midwest, organizing over thirty libraries including those of Denison University, Kenyon College, and Baptist Union Theological Seminary. She also organized the public libraries of Elyria, Ohio; La Crosse, Wisconsin; and Duluth, Minnesota. That same year, she joined the American Library Association. From 1888 to 1890, Dixson worked as the librarian of Denison University.\\"Mrs. J. E. Dixson,\\" 1888. From there, she went on to the Baptist Union Theological Seminary. In 1892, the Seminary became the Divinity School at the University of Chicago and Dixson was appointed assistant librarian. While working there, she earned her MA from Shephardson College for Women and would later earn her AM from Denison University in 1902. In 1895, she was promoted to associate librarian. During her career, she made three trips to Europe to study the handling of rare books.Dixson Papers. Dixson went on to become the associate librarian, instructor, and director of the library school at the University of Chicago Extension Division‚Äîa program originally designed to teach the public how to use libraries. University President William Rainey Harper had initially asked Melvil Dewey to take the position, but Dewey turned it down.International Dictionary of Library Histories, pg. 821. By 1900, Dixson had expanded the library school into a program that provided professional training for librarians.Stauffer, pg. 101. =Feud with Melvil Dewey and Katharine Sharp= In 1900, Melvil Dewey wrote a letter to the president of the University of Chicago, William Rainey Harper, stating that Dixson was incompetent as a librarian and as the program director of the library school. He also accused her of falsely claiming to be a graduate of the New York State Library School.Stauffer, pg. 104. Dixson responded by stating that she never claimed to have attended New York State Library School and that Dewey was only criticizing her work with the Extension Division because of the competition her program created with Katharine Sharp's library school at the University of Illinois in Urbana. She pointed out the many esteemed library positions held by her program's graduates, and also defended herself by presenting copies of letters and addresses Dewey wrote in which he praised Dixson as one of his best students. Dixson concluded her letter to Harper by stating: The students, graduates, and employers of those who were enrolled in the Extension Division's library school also wrote to Harper defending both the program and Dixson's competence. University library cataloger and instructor Josephine Robertson even stated her belief that Dewey was bitter over Dixson's creation and use of a different classification system than the one he devised.Stauffer, pg. 105. In 1902, Harper received a letter from the ALA's College and Reference Library Section criticizing the Extension Division's program and Dixson. Dixson responded by stating that each of their criticisms was false and accused Katharine Sharp and Melvil Dewey, who was a member of the ALA's College Section, of conspiring against her library school.Stauffer, pg. 106. She also warned Harper that, if he decided to close down the school, it would cost the university thousands of dollars in returned tuition and cause the library to lose its student workers. In July 1903, the ALA's Committee on Library Training, of which Katharine Sharp was a member, released a report on the Extension Division's school, criticizing it for not having stricter admissions requirements and for not requiring students to complete the full program before receiving a certificate.Stauffer, pg. 107. In October of that year, the library school was shut down with much protest from the students and the faculty. Later life After the library school at the University of Chicago Extension Division closed, Dixson remained as the university's associate librarian.\\"Twenty-five years,\\" 1910. In 1906, she was given an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters by Shurtleff College, which is now part of Southern Illinois University.Stauffer, pg. 108.

She remained active in the Chicago Woman's Club and the Chicago Political Equality League through 1914.Directory and Register of Women's Clubs, pg. 12, 65. Dixson died on January 12, 1924 in Chicago. Professional associations & clubs Dixson joined the American Library Association, the Illinois Library Association,Moore, 1897. and the Chicago Library Club in 1886. She was a member of the Chicago Woman's Club and president of the Mt.

Trained as an artist, he began working with sounds that characterize cities following an Egyptian multimedia art program. He presents unmodified field recordings from Lagos city lifefor instance, its danfo share taxi systemin gallery installations with headphones and speakers. His non-audio work uses iconography from Lagos city life. He participated in the DAAD Artists-in-Berlin Program and 2015 Venice Biennale, and received the 2016 Bremen B√∂ttcherstra√üe Art Award. His work has exhibited at the Brooklyn Museum, American National Museum of African Art, Menil Collection, Casino Luxembourg, and Kiasma. Critics noted his soundscapes' chaos and complexity, and his focus on recontextualizing rather than transforming the city's sounds.  Early life  Ogboh was born in Enugu, Nigeria, on May 14, 1977. He studied graphic design at University of Nigeria, Nsukka, and graduated in 2001. He lives in Lagos, Nigeria, and Berlin.  Work  Ogboh is a sound and video artist. He became interested in sound art during a media class at the 2008 Fayoum Winter Academy with Austrian multimedia artist Harald Scherz. Following this experience, Ogboh paid attention to the interaction of sounds in Lagos as compositions rather than individual voices. Ogboh compared the soundscapes to orchestra symphonies, with layered voices rather than strictly chaotic noise. He also appreciated the soundscape's ability to \\"transport the listener\\" and found the sound medium most engaging. Ogboh's sound works have explored the audible expressions that characterize cities, particularly in Lagos, where he lives, works, and was affected by the city's fast pace and unpredictability. He has said that the city's intense, natural soundscapes are jarring for all visitors. OkayAfrica wrote that his work was \\"rich with sociopolitical commentary\\". In this way, the power blackout during the Nigerian 2014 FIFA World Cup game was not an angry crowd but a \\"honest commentary on the government's provision of resources\\". Ogboh has taken these Lagos recordings to museums around the world since 2008. The danfo share taxi, illustrated in this video, is iconic of Lagos, Nigeria, and a recurrent figure in Ogboh's work. He originally recorded Lagos for his use in-studio, but when presented with the idea of sharing the sound for artistic installation, he began to edit the clips for their best representation of Lagos and considered the best method of public dissemination. Home from his Egyptian art program, Ogboh was inspired to create the Lagos Soundscapes project when the artist was able to identify the sounds of his city during a phone call with a friend. As he transitioned to the field, he turned to online help in discussion forums and email. In his installations, Ogboh prefers audio that requires minimal studio manipulation, and does not significantly alter the sounds. Some audio effects come from the recording environment, both surfaces that echo and distort sound, and the effect of traveling with a recorder. His first sound installation was in the Fayoum academy's bathroom, followed by his first Lagos Soundscapes installation at the Lagos African Artists' Foundation in 2009. Ogboh remembered reception mostly around his work's novelty. The works are typically installed in listening booths with headphones, though they were also installed in the public streets of Cologne and Helsinki as a commentary on globalization. His Lagos by Bus is a recording of Lagos passengers traveling the danfo share taxis and molue minibuses characteristic of the city to work. A vendor offers a prayer before selling medication to riders, as a sociopolitical protest song by Fela Kuti plays on the radio. The 40-minute installation was exhibited at Cologne's Rautenstrauch-Joest Museum in 2010, and the booth was painted yellow with black stripes and stickers to imitate the hallmarks of the danfo. An outdoor installation at the Cologne Public Library piped the streets of Lagos to those of Cologne. A similar installation took place at Helsinki's Kiasma contemporary art museum. Ogboh hosted an online stream of his Lagos Soundscapes in collaboration with the Goethe Institut Lagos for the July 2013 World Listening Day. In a Houston installation at the Menil Collection, Ogboh installed a danfo bus, which he uses as a \\"spontaneous 'agora that carries a culture as Lagos's \\"most iconic symbol\\". He also created videosFractal Scapesas abstracted time-based' paintings\\" of the city, and began collaborations with musicians who referred to Ogboh's Lagos recordings. In 2014, his The Ambivalence of 1960 was featured in an exhibition at the Casino Luxembourg. The piece is a six-minute collage of speeches from Nigeria's 1960 independence festivities, including those of President Nnamdi Azikiwe, Prime Minister Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, and English Princess Alexandra of Kent. Their aspirations for a human rights, freedom, religious tolerance, and economic development, compared with the present day, show Nigeria's political failures over the previous half-century. Ogboh visited New York City in September 2014 with his danfo share taxi, a symbol of public transport in Lagos, for a one-day installation (Lagos State of Mind II at The Africa Center in Harlem. The installation included photos of the taxi with historic landmarks and African-American neighborhoods in New York City, juxtaposed against sounds situated in and out of the taxi. One of Ogboh's earlier works, Verbal Maps of Ojuelegba, features a Lagos danfo driver reciting the Ojuelegba route. The artist noted how hawking has been banned on Lagos's new roads and that the danfo share taxi will eventually disappear, along with their contribution to the city's soundscapes. This historical element was not an initial consideration in the project, though the artist planned for his future work to narrate the transformation of the city. Ogboh participated in the title exhibit of the 2015 Venice Biennale, All the World's Futures, with The Song of the Germans (Deutschlandlied), a piece in which African refugees sang the German national anthem in their first languages. He had participated in the 2014 DAAD Artists-in-Berlin Program and exhibited in the city. Ogboh won the 2016 Bremen B√∂ttcherstra√üe Art Award for his installation at the Kunsthalle Bremen. The piece, The Continental Entr√©e, refers to the advertisements of street food vendors and the European Union as a destination for African migrants with a neon sign that reads, \\"FOOD IS R‚Ç¨ADY\\". Later that year, Ogboh exhibited at the Brooklyn Museum's \\"Disguise: Masks and Global African Art\\" and the United States National Museum of African Art. At the former, he showed a 2015 sound installation, Egwutronica, of remixed Igbo music, and at the latter, his 28-minute soundscape of the Balogun Market (titled Market Symphony) was the museum's first sound art piece. Its audio played through speakers embedded in painted enamel trays, the same used to display goods at the market. In late 2016, his work was installed in the African Union's Julius Nyerere Peace and Security Building in Addis Ababa. Ogboh's work The Way Earthly Things Are Going was installed at Tate Modern in 2017. Shortly afterwards, he was shortlisted for the 2018 Hugo Boss Prize. In August 2019, his latest work, a site-specific installation entitled √Åm√†: The Gathering Place debuted at the Cleveland Museum of Art. The installation, which features a soundscape and a large textile-covered sculpted tree, is meant to evoke daily life in an Igbo village.http://clevelandart.org/exhibitions/ama-gathering-place Ogboh is currently represented by Galerie Imane Far√®s, after a long stint as a \\"willingly unrepresented artist\\".  Reception  Art historian and curator Ugochukwu-Smooth Nzewi described Ogboh's work as capturing \\"the maddening hyper-visuality of Lagos\\". Ogboh was among Nzewi's most anticipated artists at the 2014 contemporary African art festival 1:54. In 2013, Ogboh reported reception of his Lagos Soundscapes as mixed: annoying some and intriguing others. Quiet European cities have considered the work \\"noisy and obtrusive\\", in one case destroying a speaker and calling the police on the installation. The artist appreciated the installation's effect on Nigerians abroad, and how being in earshot of the soundscape confused them in their foreign environment. Art historian Carol Magee noted how even in the business of the Lagos Soundscapes, she felt a stillness in which her attention was focused and the patterns unchanging despite the cacophony of the scene. Malawian visual artist Massa Lemu described Ogboh's work as embodying Afropolitanism, in which African cities were representative of a busy, globalized world and its multiple cultures centralized in one place. Lemu thought of Ogboh's soundscapes as \\"auditory landscapes\\" that recreate a sense of the Lagos environment. He additionally compared Ogboh's practice with that of sound artists James Webb (South Africa) and Magdi Mostafa (Egypt), though these two tend to manipulate their recordings where Ogboh instead recontextualizes the original. For this reason, Lemu considered Ogboh's work to be closer in lineage to John Cage's recontextualized found sounds than the practice of El Anatsui or Romuald Hazoume recycling found objects as commentary on economic conditions.

College career Fuller with UCLA in 2012 Fuller was recruited to UCLA as a quarterback. However, he was behind several players including Brett Hundley on the Bruins' depth chart. Wanting to get Fuller's skills on the field, they moved him to wide receiver five games into his freshman year in 2012. Playing at the slot position, Fuller had 20 receptions for 145 yards in eight games. He continued to improve, finishing with 43 catches, which ranked second on the team, for 471 yards in 2013. He also threw a touchdown pass to Hundley against Utah. As a junior in 2014, Fuller was again second in receptions, catching 59 passes for 447 yards and a touchdown. He had at least four receptions in nine games, and his 93-yard touchdown against Utah was the second-longest in UCLA history. In his senior year in 2015, Fuller was moved from the slot to the outside to give him more matchups against man-to-man coverage. The Bruins also lost Hundley, who had left for the NFL, and replaced him with freshman Josh Rosen. Fuller had his best game of the season against California, when he caught seven passes for a career-high 100 yards and two touchdowns. However, he was hampered by injuries to his head and ankles that year, and his production fell to just 24 catches for 259 yards and three touchdowns. He still excelled as a kick returner, ranking sixth in the Pac-12 Conference with a 24.2 yard average. He finished his college career with 146 receptions for 1,322 yards and 10 touchdowns. Professional career Fuller was disappointed that he was not invited to the NFL Scouting Combine.

Plot Acting Detective Inspector Logan McRae manages to catch Graham Stirling who has kidnapped Stephen Bisset and tortured him. Unfortunately the only way to get Stirling to talk is to break a few rules regarding procedure.... With Professional Standards breathing down his neck, Logan is sent on a \\"development opportunity\\" babysitting a rural patch of north-east Aberdeenshire as a police Sergeant. A child's body found in the Tarlair Swimming Pool, a hopeful mother of a dead girl and Detective Chief Inspector Steele messing things up really do not help Logan settle into his new job. The dead girl's mother (Helen) even moves into Logan's police house whilst he is supposed to be finding out who the dead girl is and who killed her. Added to this is the prospect of fighting off the son and daughter of Stephen Bisset who want answers from Logan, Graham Stirling being released and twisting the story of Stephen Bisset's death means that Samantha (Logan's girlfriend) is kidnapped while still comatose from the fire in Logan's flat in a previous story. The original cover features the open-air Tarlair Swimming Pool on the Banffshire coast. MacBride said that he scouted the location and when he saw how dilapidated the swimming pool was, he declared that he \\"just had to find a body in there.\\" MacBride also went on several drugs raids with Police Scotland and also spent some time with their traffic unit in the area. Critical reception Shirley Whiteside, writing in The Independent, was positive about the book and states that \\"MacBride has written another riveting page-turner. Although seamed with his usual pitch-black humour it is not as macabre as some of McRae's previous outings but is more emotional and affecting.\\" Laura Wilson, writing in The Guardian, was impressed by the slower pace of the novel stating that Jane Jakeman, writing in The Independent, said \\"This is a big, fat book, with the story unrolling over nearly 600 pages, but the multiple plots move fast and MacBride convincingly conveys the dilapidated atmosphere of the police station ‚Äì surely the most realistic in this fictional survey, with its peeling walls and ancient banter.\\" References Category:2015 British novels Category:Novels set in Aberdeenshire Category:Novels set in Scotland Category:Novels by Stuart MacBride ","title":"The Missing and the Dead"},{"id":"50377400","text":"Meschac Gaba (born 1961) is a Beninese conceptual artist based in Rotterdam and Cotonou. His installations of everyday objects whimsically juxtapose African and Western cultural identities and commerce. He is best known for The Museum of Contemporary African Art 1997‚Äì2002, an autobiographical 12-room installation acquired and displayed by the Tate Modern in 2013. He has also exhibited at the Studio Museum in Harlem and at the 2003 Venice Biennale.  Early life and career  Meschac Gaba was born in Cotonou, Benin, in 1961. He had drifted from his training as a painter until a bag of decommissioned money cut into confetti led him to make paintings with the material. Gaba became known for his installations of everyday objects that whimsically juxtapose African and Western cultural identities and commerce. He held a residency at the Amsterdam Rijksakademie in 1996 for two years. In the absence of opportunities to display his work in the city, he set out over the next five years to make his own museum. This piece became his seminal The Museum of Contemporary African Art 1997‚Äì2002, which consists of 12 rooms (some based on museum function and others personal) filled with objects made by Gaba. Throughout the exhibition ran a vein of confessional narrative about the artist's art travails between Africa and Europe. The wedding room, which he made while in love, holds mementos as museum artifacts from Gaba's wedding to the Dutch curator Alexandra van Dongen in 2000 at the Amsterdam Stedelijk Museum. The Library room holds art books and tells of Gaba's childhood. The games room showed sliding puzzle tables that form African national flags. It had its own gift shop and caf√©. The exhibited Museum had couches for reading, a piano for playing, and featured objects reflecting Africa's polycultural character, including Ghanaian money featuring the face of Picasso, a Swiss bank mimicking an African street market, and gilded ceramic chicken legs. The Museum exhibited widely. The work was first displayed in part in 2002 at Documenta 11. Gaba received a Rotterdam space in which he could live and store the work. When his son requested a more normal house, Gaba sold and gifted most of the work to the Tate Modern, save for his Library, which Gaba returned to his hometown. Around 2013, Gaba lived half the year in his hometown of Cotonou and the other half in Rotterdam with his wife and son. The Tate Modern displayed the work as a whole in 2013 as part of the Tate's two-year program of African-focused exhibitions. The wedding room enchanted the British art critic Jonathan Jones, who described the Museum as autobiographical, novelistic, protest showing \\"the strength of modern African art\\". For instance, the Art and Religion room showed \\"classic\\" African ceremonial sculpture alongside kitschy Buddhist and Christian objects, as if to group the types together as poor representations of their respective cultures. Gaba saw the work as correcting lacks of art education in Africa and African art representation outside the continent. In-between finishing the Museum and its Tate exhibition, Gaba presented at the 2003 Venice Biennale and held his first solo show in the United States at the Studio Museum in Harlem, \\"Tresses\\", a series of architectural models of New York City and Benin landmarks made from artificial braided hair extensions. The accessory, popularized by African- American pop stars based on West African culture, was repatriated to Africa. Gaba worked with a Beninese hair braider to make the sculptures from his photographs. The New York Times wrote that the works were \\"delightful\\" and recognizable without becoming caricatures. Gaba held his first solo gallery show, \\"Exchange Market\\", in New York in 2014. On the ground floor, 10 sculptures of unvarnished wood tables each with a wire umbrella stand, from which African banknotes hung. Each table was associated with a type of commodity: cotton, cocoa, diamonds. Along the walls hung bank-shaped works made of wood, plexiglass, and decommissioned money. Upstairs, reminiscent of the games room of Gaba's museum, were four foosball tables and small souvenir sculptures such as hand-painted cricket bats and a miniature billiards table. Artsy selected Gaba's work as a highlight of the 2014 1:54 London art fair.

Education and early life Bayvel was born into a Jewish family, and grew up in Kharkiv and Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) until 1978. Her father is the physicist Leopold P. Bayvel, her mother Raisa (Rachel) was a textile/pattern technologist/garment engineer and later published studies in Eastern-European Jewish history. Rachel Bayvel ¬´From ‚Äòthe Doctors' Plot‚Äô to the death of Stalin¬ª] She was educated in England at Hasmonean High School for Girls and University College London where she was awarded a Bachelor of Engineering degree in 1986 followed by a PhD in 1990. In 1990, she was awarded a Royal Society Postdoctoral Exchange Fellowship in the Fibre Optics Laboratory at the General Physics Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences in Moscow. Research and career Bayvel's research has focused on maximising the speed and capacity of optical fibre communication systems, and the fundamental studies of capacity-limiting optical nonlinearities and their mitigation. She has made major contributions to the investigation and design of high- bandwidth, multi-wavelength optical communication networks. She was one of the first to show the feasibility of using the wavelength domain for routing in optical networks over a range of distance- and time-scales. She has established the applicability of these new optical network architecture concepts, which have been widely implemented in commercial systems and networks. These systems and networks underpin the Internet, and the digital communications infrastructure ‚Äì and are essential for its growth. A new project, the Initiate project, aims to test technologies that will make internet connections faster and more secure, which Polina Bayvel indicated will allow them to test them at a national scale. Her research has been funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC). Awards and honours Bayvel won the Institute of Physics Clifford Paterson Medal and Prize in 2002. She was also elected a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering in 2002 and was awarded the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Photonic Society Engineering Achievement Award in 2013.

It was given its world premiere on April 8, 2010 by the spousal team of the violinist Mira Wang and the cellist Jan Vogler and the Boston Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Carlos Kalmar. The piece was composed in honor of the violinist Roman Totenberg. Composition The Double Concerto has a duration of roughly 25 minutes and is composed in three numbered movements.

Of the first movement, he wrote, \\"Slight 'misunderstandings,' known to music theorists as cross- relationships (unnecessarily pejorative in implication ‚Äî they are often beautiful) are taken to a systemic level, perhaps standing for more telling misunderstandings.

The site is a Provincial and Municipal Historic Resource, and home to the Edmonton Public School Board's archives and museum. History The original one-room school house was constructed in 1881 on land donated by the Hudson's Bay Company, using funds raised by Matthew McCauley, Malcolm Groat and William Rowland. The smooth-finished wooden building featured a porch, double doors, eight large windows and ten-foot ceilings. The growing population of Edmonton required the construction of a larger school house. Architect Henry Denny Johnson would be contracted to design the three-storey, eight-room school on the site of the original 1881 school house. Johnson would utilize the Richardsonian Romanesque architectural style. In 1904 R. J. Mason would receive the contract to build the school, and construction would begin later in the year with Governor General, Lord Minto laying the cornerstone, and construction completed and opened on 1 September 1905, the same day the province of Alberta would enter Confederation. Construction would not start on the Alberta Legislature Building until 1907, and be completed until 1913, so the Legislative Assembly of Alberta would use the McKay Avenue School for the first two sessions of the First Legislative Assembly of Alberta in 1906 and 1907. Important bills passed in those sessions include confirming Edmonton as the provincial capital, the founding of the University of Alberta, establishment of provincial courts, and the provision of charters for several railway companies. The school was named after Dr. William MacKay, a physician for the Hudson's Bay Company, although the building retains the misspelled McKay name. With dwindling enrollment in the downtown Edmonton area, totaling 59 in its final year, the McKay Avenue School was closed on June 30, 1983. Edmonton Public Schools Archives and Museum The Edmonton Public Schools Archives and Museum is located in the McKay Avenue School. The organization is a public research facility housing records and artifacts related to Edmonton Public Schools. It also offers curriculum-based, hands-on education programs for students and a museum highlighting the history of Edmonton Public Schools and Alberta's early political history. The museum features a 1950s-period schoolroom and the restored 1906 legislative assembly room. Between 2019 and 2020, the museum was the site of a traveling exhibition from the Anne Frank House. Following flooding in February 2013, the McKay School was found have significant structural damage requiring $2.4-million in restoration. A fund raising campaign began with saw the Edmonton Public School Board, City of Edmonton, Government of Alberta, Government of Canada and private donors raise the necessary funds to repair the building by 2016. The renovated building would reopen to the public in October 2018. The museum also includes the original 1880s schoolhouse adjacent to the McKay Avenue School, which the McKay Avenue School replaced in 1905. The schoolhouse is used for museum education programs.

Synopsis Amer met Raghda in a Syrian prison fifteen years ago. When released, they got married and started a family together, only to be torn apart by the Assad dictatorship. At ages four and fourteen, their children Bob and Kaka have already spent their whole lives watching either of their parents go to prison for their political beliefs. Production Filming began in 2009, prior to the revolutions in Arab countries‚Äì at the time, Raghda was a political prisoner and Amer was caring for their children alone. It was filmed in the Yarmouk Camp in Damascus, infamous for its treatment of inhabitants, which included starvation. Reception The film received very positive reviews. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film five stars and said, 'McAllister shows us the human cost of a geopolitical tragedy; he shows us that ‚Äúrefugees‚Äù are not just nameless pathetic mendicants whose only desire is pity. They are as intelligent and complex as the EU citizens glimpsing them on the news. It is a compelling film.' Trevor Johnston of Time Out gave the film four stars and said, ' ‚ÄòA Syrian Love Story‚Äô presents us first with the gnawing anxiety of life under the ruthless Al-Assad regime, then the fresh challenges of a fractious, painful exile where damaged minds take time to heal, before we finally see the household become distant observers to the destruction of their homeland and the deaths of many friends.'

Celebrating its 250th anniversary in 2005, it is the oldest continuous such society in Great Britain. Establishment The Society was established in March 1755, with the object and purpose of \\"encouraging agriculture and local manufactures, and the promotion of the general good of the county.\\" The first subscribing members to the Society were: Sir Edward Williams, of Gwernyfed; John Hughes; Hugh Penry; Charles David; John Phillips; William Morgan, clerk; Thomas Williams, clerk (then headmaster of Christ College); Marmaduke Gwynne; Edward Jeffreys; James Parry; Charles Lloyd; John Williams, clerk; Penry Williams, of Penpont; and Thomas Price Additional early members of the Society included Peregrine Thomas Bertie, Duke of Ancaster; Dr. Tucker, Dean of Gloucester; Valentine Morris, of Piercefield; Thomas Bathurst, of Lydney; Dr. Linden; Sir Charles Hanbury Williams; Sir Charles Morgan; Viscount Hereford, of Tregoyd; several Earl Camdens; the late Lord Tredegar; Robert Thompson Crawshay of Cyfarthfa Castle; the Duke of Beaufort, the Right Hon. Lord Tredegar, Sir J. R. Bailey, Bart., M.P. (lord lieutenant of the county), Sir Charles Alexander Wood, and Mr. James Price William Gwynne-Holford. The landowners and farmers met to discuss questions relevant to the times. The Society in its early days offered premiums for cloth manufactured in the county, but the competition was not successful, and led to no adequate result. The Society in its early days offered premiums for turnips, but there were people in those days that could not see the use of growing turnips, for it was observed \\"that it was only after experiencing difficulties and encountering prejudices suggested by that dislike and hatred of innovation which characterizes the country [that's rather a reflection on our forefathers], they ultimately succeeded in introducing this valuable vegetable into general use in this part of the principality.\\" The earliest transcribed rules of the Society stated that it was more of a \\"county club,\\" as every subscriber must pay \\"for his ordinary each meeting one shilling, and for his extraordinary a like sum.\\" The members met more frequently than annually, for the second meeting was held on 16 April 1755, or a few weeks only after its formal establishment. The Society imbibed another old custom: a man was called upon to pay for his dinner whether he was present to eat it or not. The Society's meetings, besides being of a practical turn, evidently finished up with good fellowship and conviviality, as dinner was set on the table at \\"two o'clock,\\" and the \\"Society was to break up at ten\\". Awards In 1810, the \\"Brecknockshire Society for the Encouragement of Agriculture\\" offered 39 premiums, amounting in money value to ¬£179, and two gold medals, one value ten guineas and the other five guineas. Prizes were offered for the reclamation and fallowing of common land for wheat, and to the farm labourers and boys who drilled and hoed the greatest number of acres of turnips.

At each move the family integrated into the local Wesleyan Methodist congregation, prominent in activities and taking responsible positions. :He owned other properties in premium locations, including a house in Third Street, Knightsbridge (now Leabrook) and in 1883 sold several blocks in Fullarton Estate. In mid-1894 he and his brother John Napier Birks (1845‚Äì1929) helped establish a communist settlement at Murtho on the River Murray as part of the Village Settlement scheme, and acted as secretary of the Murtho Settlement Society. Five years later the settlement was deserted, all members having lost a great deal of money, the Birks brothers perhaps more than any other. :Walter, who had liquidated much of his assets (It was a condition of membership of the Murtho Association that each member contribute their entire wealth to the project)David Mack Irrigation Settlement: Some historical aspects in South Australia on the River Murray 1838‚Äì1978 pub.

This article cites cancer as the cause of his relatively early death. His eldest son, electrical engineer Lawrence Birks returned from England too late for the funeral. :Jemima Crooks arrived in South Australia with her parents William (c. 1808 ‚Äì 8 September 1887) and Ann Thompson Crooks n√©e Thompson ( ‚Äì 13 October 1875) in December 1872. Jemima's brother Alexander Crooks (23 September 1847 ‚Äì 29 August 1943) married Emily Hannah Birks (1844 ‚Äì 13 July 1926) on 18 September 1873 =History= Melville Birks spent his early childhood in Murtho, one of the Village Settlements on the Murray River, in which experiment his parents lost their life savings. He received his early education at State schools and took a course in agriculture at Roseworthy College where he distinguished himself, gaining the silver medal as dux of his year in 1894. He was a quiet gentle boy with poor eyesight, not a genius like brother, but his ambitions lay in the medical field, and in 1896 went to Way College in order to matriculate. Through the generosity of a maiden aunt he was in 1899 able to embark on a medical degree course at the University of Adelaide, which he completed in five years, and incidentally proved to be an excellent rower. He gained his medical degree in 1902 and served a year as House Surgeon at the Adelaide Hospital, then spent three years in England and on the Continent, and was made a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons (F.R.C.S), which he gained despite needing to practice his profession while he studied. While in London he met Janet Catherine \\"Netta\\" MacIntyre, a daughter of Patrick B. MacIntyre of Findon, Roseshire of Crofters Commission fame. Janet had trained as a nurse at St Thomas' Hospital in London, and was appointed sister-in-charge of the Nightingale Training School and Home for Nurses (now Florence Nightingale School of Nursing and Midwifery), attached to that hospital. They were married shortly afterwards and in 1908 returned to Australia, settling in Peterborough (then called Petersburg) where Melville practised in partnership with Dr. Goode from 1908 to 1913. While in Peterborough, he became interested in occupational diseases peculiar to railwaymen. He took a great interest in public affairs and gave lectures on health and other subjects for the Railway Town Men's Movement, and the Y.M.C.A and in his early days there often gave morning lectures at the old Socialist Hall. For a time he held the position of Mayor. On 1 June 1913 he succeeded Dr. Seabrook as Superintendent of the Broken Hill Hospital. Here his efficiency and broad sympathy won him many friends, but his straightforward honesty aroused antagonism on both sides of the Union question, which was always to the fore in that town, often having to side with either the employer or employee in Workmen's Compensation cases. He volunteered to serve during The Great War, but was rejected on account of the essential nature of his position, but the War cost him in other ways, as he had to run the hospital with inadequate staff. The author of this obituary was evidently a nurse at Broken Hill. He worked for long hours in the operating theatre, supported only by nursing staff. While at \\"The Barrier\\" he did much important research work on miner's phthisis (silicosis) and lead poisoning. In 1919 he was granted a year's study leave and proceeded with his family to Great Britain, Europe, Canada and America studying diseases of miners. While in Brussels he read a paper on lead poisoning at a World Medical Conference. He resumed his post as Surgeon Superintendent of Broken Hill Hospital in September 1920 the following year but in August 1922, feeling out of sorts, he went for a holiday to the Eastern States, where in Wentworth he collapsed. He spent some time with his brother Walter Richard Birks (1886‚Äì1960), who was in charge of the Agricultural College at Dookie, Victoria, then to Melbourne, where his peculiar disease was diagnosed by Dr. Stawell, and was admitted to a private hospital where he was nursed for eleven months, then three months in Melbourne General Hospital. In December 1923 he returned to Adelaide, where four months later he died at his mother's home in Rose Park. > \\" No one can estimate the work of Dr Birks at Broken Hill both in bringing > the hospital to a high state of efficiency and in establishing a fine > training school for nurses.

It was one of five such units raised as part of the AIF during the war. Formed in March 1918, the battalion consisted of four machine gun companies, which had previously existed as independent companies assigned mainly at brigade level. The battalion consisted of 64 medium machine guns, and took part in the final stages of the war, seeing action during the Allied defensive operations during the German Spring Offensive and then the Allied Hundred Days Offensive, which finally brought an end to the war. The battalion was disbanded in mid-1919 during the demobilisation of the AIF. History One of five such units raised as part of the AIF during the war as part of the Australian Machine Gun Corps, the 2nd Machine Gun Battalion was formed in March 1918 as part of the 2nd Division. It consisted of four machine gun companies, which had previously existed as independent companies assigned mainly at brigade level. These were the 5th, 6th, 7th and the 22nd. The battalion's first commanding officer was Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Windeyer Ralston, previously of the 20th Infantry Battalion. The battalion's authorised strength was 46 officers and 890 other ranks. The establishment of machine gun battalions within the AIF was the final step in the evolution of the organisation of direct fire support during the war. At the start of the war, Maxim machine guns had been assigned within line infantry battalions on a limited scale of two per battalion. As it was realised that there was a need for increased fire support, this was later increased to four guns per battalion, operated by a section of one officer and 32 other ranks. At the end of the Gallipoli Campaign, the AIF was reorganised and expanded in preparation for its transfer to the Western Front, and the machine gun sections within each infantry battalion had been consolidated into companies assigned at brigade level. The first three of battalion's constituent companies had been formed in Egypt in March 1916 and at that time they had been assigned to the 5th, 6th and 7th Brigades respectively, arriving in Europe in mid-1916. These companies had fought through the early battles following the Australians' arrival in Europe, including Pozieres, Bullecourt and Third Ypres. The 22nd Machine Gun Company, however, had been formed in England in January 1917. Initially, the company had been designated the 17th Machine Gun Company, with the intention that it would be assigned to the newly forming 17th Brigade, but later the decision was made to assign the extra company at divisional level so that each division had four companies, and in March 1917, the company was redesignated as the 22nd and assigned to the 2nd Division, arriving in France at the end of the month, during the fighting around Ypres. The battalion's unit colour patch (UCP) was a black and gold diamond, which was usually worn above the crossed guns badge of the Machine Gun Corps. While the battalion's constituent companies had previously been issued distinctive UCPs, upon the formation of the battalion these were replaced by the single battalion style. The black and gold colours were chosen to signify that the unit as a machine gun unit, while the diamond showed that the 2nd Machine Gun Battalion was part of the 2nd Division, which used the same shape UCP for the majority of its units. The battalion was equipped with a total of 64 Vickers medium machine guns - assigned at a scale of 16 per company - and took part in the final stages of the war, seeing action during the Allied defensive operations during the German Spring Offensive and then the Allied Hundred Days Offensive, which finally brought an end to the war. During these battles, the battalion was employed to provide enfilade fire in defence, and plunging fire in support of attacking infantry forces, engaging targets out to . Due to the exposed position from which the machine gunners fired, they suffered heavy casualties. Following the conclusion of hostilities, the battalion was disbanded in mid-1919 during the demobilisation of the AIF. One member of the battalion, Lieutenant Edgar Towner, received the Victoria Cross for his actions during the war. Another soldier, Sergeant Claud Castleton, received the award while serving as part of the 5th Machine Gun Company, prior to its incorporation into the battalion. Legacy After the war, the machine gun battalion concept was discontinued in the Australian Army and in the 1920s medium machine gun platoons were added to the organisation of standard infantry battalions. However, the machine gun battalion was revived again in 1937 as fears of war in Europe surfaced again, and four Australian Light Horse regiments - the 1st, 16th, 17th and 18th - were converted into machine gun regiments. Following the outbreak of World War II, four machine gun battalions were eventually raised as part of the Second Australian Imperial Force, each assigned at divisional level. Several more units were raised within the Militia including the 6th and 7th Machine Gun Battalions, which served in New Guinea, while several more light horse regiments were also converted for home defence including the 14th, 19th, 25th and 26th. The 5th Machine Gun Battalion was also re-raised and undertook garrison duties as part of Torres Strait Force. At the end of that war, though, the decision was made to return machine guns to the establishment of individual infantry battalions and consequently since then no further machine gun battalions have been raised as part of the Australian Army. According to Alexander Rodger, as a result of the decision not to re-raise machine gun battalions in the early interwar years, no battle honours were subsequently awarded to the 2nd Machine Gun Battalion - or any other First World War machine gun battalion - as there was no equivalent unit to perpetuate the honours when they were promulgated by the Australian Army in 1927.

She collaborated on many architectural projects with her colleague and husband Behruz √áinici, with whom she cofounded √áinici Architectural Office (renamed √áinici Architects in 1963). Among her most notable commissions are the public relations building of the Turkish Parliament Quarter, and the Middle East Technical University Campus. The latter commission was received when the √áinici proposal, designed and submitted by Altuƒü and Behruz, was awarded first place by the project jury. Behruz framed their approach to the METU campus design as a challenge to the International Style of architecture that dominated architectural theory, education and culture. Rather than fit the landscape to the √áinici design, the √áinici proposal was the product of intensive site visits. After the construction of the METU campus, the √áinici firm continued with projects that included state commissions and other educational facilities. As a result, the firm was the recipient of multiple domestic and international awards, including the Simavi Foundation Award (1985), Is Bank Award (1994), Aga Khan Award for the Mosque of the Grand National Assembly (1995), and the Architect Sinan Award (2004).

There is very little information available about Gabriel the Hilandarian, like most modest monks who lived in the 14th and early 15th century. It is known that he translated Olympiodorus the Younger's commentary on the Book of Job from Greek in 1411‚Äì12. The manuscript is now held at the State Historical Museum in Moscow. In his younger days, Gabriel resided and worked at the Resava (Manasija) Monastery, built between 1407 and 1418 by Despot Stefan Lazareviƒá. According to Constantine of Kostenets, Resava was built specifically as a centre for the followers of the Hesychasm movement, showing that Stefan held them in great esteem. Stefan endowed Resava generously with icons and books, and established a scriptorium and a translation school within the monastery. Old texts were corrected and copied and many were translated from Hebrew, Greek, Old Armenian, Old Georgian, Coptic, Syriac, and Old Latin. Among notable translators were Gabriel; Anonymous monk (Books of Kings, in 1411‚Äì12); the monk Jacob (Hexaemeron of John Chrysostom, first book, in 1425‚Äì26); Venedikt Crepoviƒá (Hexaemeron of John Chrysostom, second book, in 1425‚Äì26); and priest Panareta. During that time, translators made technical improvements in texts while they were being translated. Most of the scribes working in the scriptorium after completing their apprenticeship left for other monasteries in the then Serbian Empire.

A second war breaks out, and Alberto tries to avoid danger. If he is to change his life, he must face his fear. Reception The New York Times, reviewing the film in 1939, describes El Cobarde as \\"likely to keep the spectators guessing until the last reel\\". In their reviewer's opinion, Cardonas combines some psychology with \\"considerable talk about the now generally discredited theory of prenatal influence\\", a mother's genuine pride in her son, and a gentle romance. Soler, says the reviewer, plays the \\"vacillating\\" son of a hero well, and Delhort is \\"excellent as the Spartan mother\\" intent on preserving the family tradition of patriotic bravery.

It consisted of nine episodes. It is not one of the better-remembered adaptations of Little Women, possibly because it was made on a relatively low budget and nearly all shot in the studio. There were also comments about the actresses playing the March sisters being too old for the part, and some of the cast struggling with an American accent.

They are native to the United States.  Description  Southern stargazers are able to reach a maximum size of . These fish have a brownish body color with small white spots, and their pectoral fins are lined in black and white. Their tails have three black or brown stripes on the caudal. They use their pectoral fins to dig and bury themselves in the sediment. They have 8 dorsal spines, 13‚Äì14 soft dorsal rays, no anal spines, and 13 soft anal rays. They have a cleithral spine that has a venom gland. When they bury themselves in the sand they leave their eyes, nostrils, and most of their mouth above the sand. In order to breathe they take water in through the nostrils which are protected from the sand by fleshy comb-shaped fringes; the mouth also has these fringes. These fish do not have scales on the top of their heads, but have them on the rest of their bodies extending onto the fleshy part of the caudal fin. Their eyes are able to protrude slightly from the head appearing stalked, and this is to allow them to see above the sand. By using an organ located in a pouch behind their eyes they are able to create an electrical current. They are able to generate a voltage as strong as 50 volts, and this is mainly used for protection instead of a way to capture their prey. The discharge of this organ depends on the temperature of the water.  Diet  They are predatory fish that lie in wait for smaller fish to swim near them while they are buried under the sand with their head the only thing that is not buried.  Habitat  The southern stargazers are benthic marine fish that are reef-associated. They live most of their lives inshore. Stargazers can be found at depths of in areas that have sandy, silty, or soft rubble bottoms.  Reproduction and life cycle  Spawning occurs in the late spring and early summer months. They spawn on the bottom and their small transparent eggs slowly rise to the surface. When the eggs hatch the larvae are transparent that live in the water column. The larvae feed on their yolk sac until they reach a length of about . Once they reach this size they start to feed off of other larvae in the water column. When they reach about in length their electric organs begin to form on the larvae, and they begin to head to the bottom and become a true juvenile. The juveniles are likely to move inshore to sandy bay, and may stay there for many years. This is where the juveniles develop the characteristics that the adults have. The eye will move to the top of the head, on the juvenile they are on the side of the head. Once they reach about in length they will move offshore and become adults.  Distribution  The southern stargazer is found in the western Atlantic from North Carolina, and south along the coast to the Gulf of Mexico to the Yucat√°n. They can be found along the Caribbean Central and South America's coast from Mexico to Rio de Janeiro. They are not found in the West Indies.  Etymology  Astroscopus is Latin for one who aims at the stars.

Depiction The other side of vessel Greek theatre was an integral part of Greek society, displaying tales of mythology and heroes. Simplicity of the pelike‚Äôs background contrasts the complex costumed characters rendered with contour and motion lines in drapery highlights the figures and the importance of the figures. The characters are centered on the pelike with stances slanted in order to mimic the shape of the vessel itself giving off a curvilinear theme with the borders of the scene contrast it by being rectilinear, serving as the boundaries of the scene depicted. In the classical style, the scene is a transitional scene catching the actors right before they take the stage. The scene contains no major action but because the scene contains actors it is important. Actors were seen as celebrities in ancient Greece. The mask is an important part of Greek theatre, for in theaters such as the Theatre of Dionysus 14,000 people came to watch including prisoners who released just for theatrical events.Neer, Richard T. \\"Chapter 4: The \\"Orientalizing\\" Period.\\" Greek Art and Archaeology: A New History, C. 2500-c. 150 BCE.

C. Burnett was an American preacher who recorded gospel songs and sermons extensively in the late-1920s and intermittently thereafter until the 1940s. During his heyday, recording for Columbia Records, Burnett was one of the most commercially successful preachers on race records, alongside Reverend J. M. Gates and Reverend A. W. Nix. Years following Burnett's close of his recording career, his sermons still receive attention on compilation albums and from musical artists, particularly Bob Dylan. Biography A native of Mobile, Alabama, Burnett joined the Baptist ministry in 1911, preaching \\"good old-fashioned sermons in a manner made famous by the Reverend J. M. Gates\\", as writer Lerone A. Martin noted in his book Preaching on Wax: The Phonograph and the Shaping of Modern African American Religion. The self-taught Reverend, who proudly proclaimed he \\"never spent a day at school\\", began achieving success preaching on the gospel tent circuit in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. Burnett was first recorded by the small Kansas-based record label, Merit Records, which was managed by musician and music store owner Winston Holmes. With Holmes, the Reverend recorded his sermon, \\"The Downfall of Nebuchadnezzar\\", and, despite limited promotional capacities, a Columbia Records talent scout \\"discovered\\" Burnett in late-1926. However, the Reverend's work with Columbia was briefly delayed as Holmes, who still had a recording contract with Burnett, filed a lawsuit against the label, which he consequently lost. Burnett re-recorded \\"The Downfall of Nebuchadnezzar\\", and the sermon sold unexpectedly well‚Äîapproximately 80,000 copies in total‚Äîas listeners were interested in the Reverend's emotive interpretation of Daniel 4:14. Settled in New York City, Burnett, from 1926 to 1929, recorded 32 sermons (four unissued), becoming one of the more extensively represented preachers on record. Most of the Reverend's work saw him accompanied by vocalists Sister Ethel Granger and Odette Jackson, and organist Porter Grainger. Inspired mainly by the writings found in the Book of Revelation, the Reverend found additional success with sermons such as \\"The Great Day of His Wrath Has Come\\". The Reverend took a nine-year hiatus from recording, but returned to New York City in 1938 to record eight sermons for Decca Records, including another version of \\"The Downfall of Nebuchadnezzar\\". Burnett's former organist, Grainger, recommended the Reverend to record producer Joe Davis in 1945, leading to eight more sermons (two unissued) being released on Davis's Jay Dee label. As many as 16 sermons were anticipated to be released; however, in February 1946 Davis bought out the remainder of the Reverend's recording contract for $100.00. The Reverend's later life is unknown, but it is speculated he returned to preaching until his death. Burnett is the first individual to record the widely-covered song \\"Jesus Make Up My Dying Bed\\", although his rendition was never released officially. Nonetheless, the composition is thought to have influenced Blind Willie Johnson's version of \\"Jesus Make Up My Dying Bed\\". Versions by Charley Patton, Bob Dylan, John Sebastian, and Led Zeppelin have also followed over the years. Dylan recorded the Christian hymn, \\"Will the Circle Be Unbroken\\", in response to Burnett's version, and released the tape on the compilation album The Bootleg Series Vol. 11: The Basement Tapes Complete, in 2011.

The battle was notable for the large-scale and spontaneous participation of the local populace, and of officers from other groups and organizations, including right-wing rivals to ELAS. The three-day battle began with the successful ambush of an Italian transport column on 4 March 1943. The Italian battalion garrisoning the nearby town of Grevena came to the column's rescue, but was halted before the town of Siatista by Greek partisan forces. The Greek forces continued to swell as reserve officers and ordinary civilians flocked as volunteers to the sound of battle, reaching a force of some 2,000 men. By nightfall on 5 March, the Italian battalion had been surrounded by the Greeks, and after incessant harassment and attacks over the following day, was forced to surrender on the night of 6/7 March. Many weapons and supplies, including field artillery, were acquired by the Greeks, and over 550 Italian troops became prisoners of war. The battle led to the liberation of Grevena from Italian occupation a few weeks later, and was a major sign of the growth of the Greek partisan movement, and the collapse of Italian rule over rural Greece. Background Italian troops entering Patras in May 1941 On 6 April 1941, following a botched Italian invasion in October 1940, Nazi Germany invaded Greece through Bulgaria and Yugoslavia. The Greek capital Athens fell on 27 April, and by June, after the capture of Crete, all of Greece was under Axis occupation. Most of the country was left to the Italian forces, while Bulgaria annexed northeastern Greece and German troops occupied the strategically most important areas. A collaborationist government was installed, but its authority with the Greek people was minimal, and its control over the country compromised by the occupation authorities, who created a patchwork of separate jurisdictions. As early as the autumn 1941, the first stirrings of a resistance movement were registered, with attacks on isolated Gendarmerie stations in Macedonia in northern Greece. The establishment of large-scale resistance organizations, most notably the communist-dominated National Liberation Front (EAM) and its military wing, the Greek People's Liberation Army (ELAS), which proceeded apace in 1942, began to challenge not only the collaborationist government's organs, but also the Italian occupation troops. On 29 January 1943, ELAS partisans entered the Macedonian town of Siatista, attacked the local Gendarmerie station and disbanded it. Lieutenant Thomas Venetsanopoulos and ten more gendarmes even joined the ELAS forces. Siatista thus became the first town in occupied Greece to be liberated. A few days later, ELAS forces clashed with an Italian Army company near the village of Snichovo (modern Despotis). As a result, the Italians engaged in reprisals against the civilian population: in the provincial capital of Grevena, the Italian battalion garrisoned there executed seven civilians, while the Lancieri di Aosta cavalry regiment burned villages in the area of the Karvounia mountains. Battle The battle comprised two different but connected engagements: an ambush on 4 March, at the pass of Vigla, against an Italian transport column, followed by the second and main battle at Fardykambos, on 5‚Äì6 March, against the Italian garrison of Grevena that set out to relieve the transport column. =4 March= On 4 March, ELAS forces from Siatista, augmented with Reserve ELAS members from the surrounding villages, some 200‚Äì250 men in total, ambushed an Italian convoy heading for Grevena from Korce via Florina and Kozani. The ambush took place in the narrow pass of Bougazi between the mountains of Sniatsiko and Bourino, at the location known as Vigla, some 3 km from Siatista itself. The partisans were armed with shotguns and antiquated Gras rifles, axes, and damascened knives, but were able to knock out the first and ninth lorries in their opening salvo, trapping the bulk of the convoy; only the tenth lorry, at the rear of the column, managed to turn around and escape. The battle lasted for three hours, and was ended when the partisans closed in for hand-to-hand combat, whereupon the Italians surrendered. Of the 180 Italians in the convoy, 15 lay dead and 34 were wounded, who were handed over to Red Cross representatives. The rest were taken prisoner. The partisans suffered only three lightly wounded. The lorries, five of which were in running order, large quantities of food, a mortar, a heavy and ten light machine guns, as well as rifles and ammunition were captured and carried off. In the meantime, when the convoy became overdue in Grevena, the local commander, Perrone Pasconelli, sent a company in four lorries to look for it, but it was halted by hastily drawn together ELAS reserves, comprising mostly old men and very young boys, at the Aliakmon River bridge. As a result, early in the afternoon, the rest of the Grevena garrison set out, 600 men in total, leaving behind only a skeleton guard. The arrival of night forced the Italians to halt at the site of the earlier skirmish near the village of Agios Georgios, while ELAS mobilized every available man from Vogatsiko, Tsotyli, and Neapoli, and the local inhabitants of Siatista and the neighbouring villages flocked to assist them, raising their strength to some 600 men. Among the people flocking to the sound of the battle were also many regular and reserve officers who were not members of ELAS; some were even members of right-wing organizations such as EKA. Nevertheless, the ELAS command welcomed them and assigned them various commands. The same happened with nearby Gendarmerie units that flocked to the battle, including the entire Gendarmerie garrison of Servia, under its commander Charalambos Koutalakis, as well as the guard installed by the Germans at the Aliakmon bridge. =5 March= On the morning of March 5, the Italians managed to cross the Aliakmon bridge and reach the defile where their supply convoy had been captured. Around noon, the Italians regrouped at a site near the crossing of the Kozani- Grevena-Kastoria road, where there were many cultivated fields and vines, known as Fardykambos. In the afternoon, the Italians attacked the partisan positions on then heights south of Siatista, using the three mountain cannons they had brought with them to great effect. Despite heavy resistance, the Italians advanced with determination, reaching the outskirts of the lower town of Siatista. At this point, the ELAS leadership decided to outflank the Italians, sending one group, under Tasianopoulos, Skotidas, and Foteinos, to attack them from the west, while 25 men from the village of Polylakkos, under Second Lieutenant Dimitrios Papagianopoulos, crossed the Aliakmon by swimming, and attacked the Italian battalion's command post. At the same time, the ELAS detachment from Grevena attacked the Italian battalion from the south, forcing it to fall back to Fardykambos. At one point, the partisans even came close to the Italian commander's tent, until nightfall forced an end to combat. As the battle had reached a critical phase, the local EAM leadership called on the retired army officer, and member of the right-wing Panhellenic Liberation Organization, Major Ioannis Kontonasios, to take over the general command of the partisan forces. Kontonasios, with Captain Athanasios Dafnis as his staff officer, established his headquarters in the monastery of the village of Mikrokastro, and ordered the complete encirclement of the Italian column. Throughout the night, local people and fighters continued to flock to the battlefield; by the dawn of 6 March, the Greek forces surrounding the Italians numbered over 2,000 men. =6 March= EAM-ELAS partisans The next day, the local population continued arriving in droves to witness the battle and encourage their own. In the words of Dominic Eudes: Nevertheless, the Italians held out during the day, beating off two concerted attacks by the partisans. The Greek attacks were hampered by the presence of Italian aircraft, although many partisans resorted to the trick of laying their cloaks over rocks and letting the Italian pilots strafe them. Other Italian aircraft dropped supplies by parachute, but many landed in the hands of the partisans instead. Finally, under the pressure of the partisans, thirst, and hunger, towards the evening Major Pasconelli appeared before Reserve Lieutenant Dimitrios Zygouras (nom de guerre \\"Palaiologos\\"), and surrendered. His horse, riderless and in panic, galloped off in the direction of Grevena, where it arrived early on the next day, bringing to the remaining Italian soldiers there the news of the disaster. The battle had lasted for 52 hours. According to the official communique issued by the local ELAS headquarters, the partisans took 17 officers and 432 other ranks prisoner, of whom 45 wounded; the partisans claimed 20 dead Italians. Three 75mm mountain guns with 300 shells, 3 motor vehicles, 57 mules and 3 chargers, 4 small mortars, 500 rifles, 30 pistols, 8 heavy machine guns, 32 submachine guns, all with ample ammunition, were captured. Greek casualties were 3 dead and 10 wounded among the guerrillas, and one dead and 3 wounded among the civilian population. Some 4,000 troops sent by the 36th Forl√¨ Infantry Division in Larissa to assist, having arrived in Servia on the evening of 5 March, torched the city in retaliation. The captives were led to Siatista, where the Italian Major was allowed to phone the Italian commander-in-chief in Greece, General Carlo Geloso, to report his surrender \\"to partisan forces superior to our own\\". At Palaiologos' insistence, the Major repeated his call to warn that the safety of the prisoners could not be guaranteed if any Italian airplane or military unit approached Siatista. Nevertheless, a few days later an Italian airplane appeared, and dropped a bomb which fell harmlessly outside the town. The Italians were eventually led to a prisoner of war camp in Pentalofos, where they remained for the next 18 months. Total Italian casualties in the three- day battle are variously reported by Palaiologos as 95 dead and 644 prisoners (including 79 wounded), while other sources calculate the total number of prisoners at 553 (17 officers and 536 other ranks). Aftermath The battle was \\"the most important battle of the later winter\\" in the rapidly developing Greek guerrilla movement. Two weeks later, on 21 March, another Italian battalion moved from Larissa to Grevena, clashing with partisans on the way but reaching its target, where it evacuated the remaining Italian garrison. Grevena was abandoned for good, and became one of the first towns of Axis- occupied Europe to be liberated. On 25 March, the anniversary of the proclamation of Greek independence, ELAS troops paraded through the city and were blessed by the city's bishop. The victory also greatly increased morale in the region and the profile of ELAS‚Äîwhich also for the first time acquired artillery. In the following months, the effective strength of ELAS in western Macedonia rose from about 50 to 2,000 men. The Battle of Fardykambos was part of a general flowering of the Greek armed resistance movement, and the concurrent retrenchment of the Italian occupying forces: already on 12 March the Italians evacuated Karditsa and abandoned it to ELAS control, and on 22 April, the Italians abandoned Metsovo, a vital communication node between eastern and western Greece. This withdrawal was not always peaceful‚Äîon 12 March, an Italian motorized column razed the village of Tsaritsani, burning 360 of its 600 houses and shooting 40 civilians‚Äîbut it led to the creation of liberated zones in much of the interior of Greece; on 16 April an Italian report noted that \\"control throughout the north-east, centre and south-west of Greece remains very precarious, not to say nonexistent\\".

The significance of the district is attributed to its association with progressive farming and the Country Life Movement, which sought to improve the living conditions of rural residents. The contributing buildings include the 1904 barn, the house (1920), the corn crib (1953), dairy barn (1955) and the feed lots. The two-story house was built by Douwe Sjaardema, a contractor from Pella, Iowa. The corn crib was built by the Iowa Concrete Crib & Silo Co. of Des Moines. The farm also includes a former landing strip for airplanes. It featured a grass runway where cows grazed on certain days. At one time it had a windsock and homemade landing lights. A hangar, no longer in existence, had been built in 1955. An automobile garage and two silos are the non-contributing resources.

Samini has been described as a \\"celebrity attorney.\\" He has represented many high-profile clients, including serving as lead counsel to former Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling in the highly publicized litigation with the National Basketball Association, TMZ, and V. Stiviano. Samini has also represented Grammy Award winning rapper T-Pain and DJ Paul of the Oscar winning hip hop group, Three 6 Mafia. Background Samini graduated with a degree in Political Science at the University of Southern California in 1992 and received his J.D. degree from The Ohio State University Moritz College of Law in 1995. Samini has been admitted to practice law in the State of California since 1996. Notable clients =Donald Sterling= Press Conference During Donald Sterling Trial Samini received national media coverage after serving as lead counsel to former owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, Donald Sterling, in litigation with the NBA, TMZ, and Sterling's ex-girlfriend V. Stiviano. In April 2014, website TMZ released an audio recording of a man reported to be Sterling making racial remarks to V. Stiviano, following an Instagram post featuring Stiviano and basketball Hall of Famer Magic Johnson. In the recording, the man believed to be Sterling, is heard saying: \\"It bothers me a lot that you want to broadcast that you're associating with black people. Do you have to?\\" and \\"You can sleep with [black people]. You can bring them in, you can do whatever you want. The little I ask you is not to promote it on that ... and not to bring them to my games.\\" Following a public outcry, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver announced that Sterling would receive a lifetime ban from the NBA, fined $2.5 million by the league, and forced to sell the team. On August 14, 2014, after an unsuccessful appeal attempt by Sterling, the sale of the Los Angeles Clippers to former Microsoft chief executive officer Steve Ballmer for $2 billion was finalized. In response to the NBA's decision, Samini called the NBA a \\"band of hypocrites,\\" citing previous discriminatory conduct by the NBA, and suggested the organization \\"take a close reflection on their own conduct.\\" In addition, Samini also served as co-counsel to Sterling in his probate and divorce proceedings with wife Shelly Sterling. In March 2016, Samini informed the Los Angeles Times that \\"notwithstanding all the difficult events of the last two years, the Sterlings have resolved their differences\\" and decided not to proceed with their divorce. On November 6, 2015, a Los Angeles judge granted TMZ's request to be dismissed from the case, ruling that TMZ had a right to release the tape because it concerned an issue of public interest. On March 22, 2016, a federal judge dismissed Sterling's antitrust lawsuit against the NBA. The judge concluded that Sterling could not \\"show that the NBA parties deprived him of a constitutionally protected interest.\\" In response, Samini released a statement, stating that \\"it is impossible to believe that, in any other circumstance, a private conversation could be recorded and distributed without an individual's consent or that private medical information could be made public in this manner all without consequence.\\" Despite the setback, Samini announced that Sterling \\"remains committed to the cause.\\" =Representation of Royal Families and Sovereigns= In 2019, Samini represented Kuwait Interior Minister Khaled Al-Sabah, a member of Kuwait's royal family, when he was defrauded out of a $163 million investment while purchasing a Beverly Hills mountain. Al-Sabah alleged that the previous owner \\"duped him into thinking he would get a 50 percent cut from his years-long investment in the property.\\" On July 16, 2020, the United States Justice Department filed a forfeiture complaint against the 157-acre undeveloped hilltop. The Justice Department accused Al-Sabah of illegally transferring more than $100 million to invest in and buy the assets. ‚ÄúMy client denies any wrongdoing whatsoever. Any suggestion that my client was involved in any illegal activity is incorrect. Mr. al-Sabah will continue to pursue his legal claims against Mr. Noval in the civil action,‚Äù said Samini.  Noteworthy cases  = Cher Lawsuit = Samini represented financial management firm SAIL Venture Partners LLC against a breach of contract action by singer and actress Cher in June 2016. According to the complaint, her trust invested $1.3 million for clean technology partnerships and claimed SAIL misrepresented the companies' performance to accrue additional fees.

The allegations included breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and professional negligence claims. The lawsuit was dismissed January 2018. = Swastika Sign Case = Samini successfully represented University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee student Grae Hosmanek pro bono after she was cited for grabbing and ripping up a man‚Äôs swastika sign on campus. On May 6, 2019, Hosmanek witnessed a group of visibly upset students surrounding a man displaying a swastika sign. \\"I kind of watched the interactions he was having with other students, and how they became increasingly upset,\\" Hosmanek said. Hosmanek was warned by a campus officer not to approach the man. However, Hosmanek ignored his warnings and destroyed the sign. Following the incident, Hosmanek was given a $456 ticket for resisting/obstructing an officer and a pair of warnings, for theft and vandalism. Hosmanek was offered a plea deal of a $1 fine for vandalism, but declined. In September 2019, Samini got the charges against Hosmanek dismissed. = Zillow Class Action = Samini represented several class action plaintiffs against online real estate database Zillow, alleging violations of California Labor Code and California Business and Professions Code. Among numerous allegations, Zillow was accused of failing to pay wages, failing to pay overtime pay, and failing to provide meal and rest breaks. On February 26, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California certified the class to include anyone who worked as an inside sales consultant at Zillow between November 2010 and January 2015. Along with attorney Mark Geragos, Samini also represented a former Zillow employee in a sexual harassment action against the company, alleging \\"sexual torture\\" and \\"the most heinous acts of sexual harassment imaginable.\\" According to the lawsuit, Zillow's Southern California office represents an \\"adult frat house where sexual harassment and misconduct are normalized, condoned, and promoted by male managers.\\" On May 5, 2016, Zillow settled the action for an undisclosed amount. = Mitsubishi Class Action = Samini served as lead counsel for a Mitsubishi dealership owner with four locations in Southern California in a multimillion-dollar litigation against Mitsubishi Motors North America. Among the allegations, the lawsuit alleged that Mitsubishi forced dealerships to stock more cars than could be sold, resulting in millions of dollars in extra finance charges.

The title is a reference to a line from the 1992 film Wayne's World. The album garnered significant attention from music journalists for its compositional and production technique. In two Guitar Center stores, Greenwald tapped people playing instruments on his iPhone, and used snippets of these low-quality trackings as loops or synth patches, playing some of them through effects pedals or 4-track machines. The \\"dystopian\\" environment of Guitar Center shops and his desire to record something without a budget while in New York City is what inspired his idea to use samples of recordings of people playing instruments and build compositions out of them. On Fact's year-end list of best Bandcamp releases, No Stairway came in at number 19. Background Raised in Columbia, Maryland, Greenwald first went to a Guitar Center store at age 14 to buy his first electric guitar. After that however, he rarely went to the former shop and instead bought equipment from local stores like Atomic Music in Beltsville, Maryland for most of his life. He disliked Guitar Center for its \\"dystopian\\" and \\"unpleasant\\" environment, which was one of the major parts of him being influenced to make No Stairway: \\"I wanted to take something unattractive and be able to extract beauty from it. I wanted to make that environment float on a cloud. I wanted to inspect little nuances, capture them, and paint with them.\\" While living in New York City, there was a point where Greenwald became bankrupt and wanted to create great-sounding tracks with no budget whatsoever without the need of using samples from a digital audio workstation or other computer software. While waiting for the train one day, he went to a Guitar Center store near Atlantic Terminal out of boredom. At the store, he heard someone playing a Green Day song on an electric guitar and noticed the instrument's poor tone: Production and composition Greenwald first tried to take control of the sounds from the expensive synthesizers Guitar Center was selling by recording samples of them, but was unimpressed with the results. On a later visit to the shop, he recorded what would be the first sound to be featured on the album; he taped a guy who \\"was just going for it on a drum kit\\", lowering the speed of the sample of the drum recording he used. The singer described how he felt while editing the sample: \\"I started to hear some kind of solace in a place that is sonically hellish.‚Äù Greenwald started recording the album in a Guitar Center in Brooklyn, and then at a shop in Baltimore. Instead of looking to record instruments specifically planned for a song, Greenwald taped whatever sound he thought that could become better in quality when editing them later. Greenwald ended up with around 40 hours of iPhone recordings to work at his home. Some snippets were played through a 4-track tape recorder, others were old pedals and some were looped or used as synthesizer patches. These recordings were put together, EQ'd, mixed and mastered in Pro Tools. Much planning was put into how the recordings were edited together, as he tried to \\"connect things that were seemingly un-connectable.\\" The end result was an album that featured ambient, dub, new-age, experimental and post-vaporwave styles. Release and reception No Stairway was first self-released on Bandcamp and Glassine's official SoundCloud page on April 17, 2015. In the same year, on August 6, record label Patient Sounds distributed the album on cassette.\\"PS073 ‚Äì Glassine ‚Äì No Stairway\\". Patient Sounds Official Bandcamp Page. Retrieved April 30, 2016. The title of the album is a reference to the line \\"No stairway, denied\\" from the 1992 comedy film Wayne's World. Live at Guitar Center, an album by Brooklyn musician Noah Wall that also used Guitar Center recordings, was released slightly before the Glassine album on April 6. When Greenwald and Patient Sounds accidentally found out about Wall's record, he almost didn't want to release No Stairway, feeling \\"gutted\\" someone had already made an album with an identical concept to his project. However, when the label made Wall aware of Greenwald's release, he was very excited about the album and his support got Greenwald motivated again to distribute his record. Greenwald has not sent No Stairway to Guitar Center despite suggestion to do so from his relatives. A Tiny Mix Tapes journalist praised the album's style as \\"some post-vaporwave produced faux melodic ambiance that‚Äôs all at once subconscious music and next-level field recording. And the esoterica and nostalgic level of listening here is completely outta-whack when paired with the idea that NONE of these samples are realmed in the same genre or created (potentially) by the same person.\\" Critic Jesse Locke featured it on his column for Aux \\"No Rest for the Obsessed\\", suggesting that listeners will want repeated hearings of Greenwald's album unlike Live at Guitar Center. Jayson Greene, scoring No Stairway a 7.2 out of ten in his review for Pitchfork, called the album along with Wall's record \\"slight redemptive\\" reminders of Guitar Center's commercial success during the 1990s pre-Internet period, which contrast with a current time where the chain of retailers may shut down quickly due to extreme financial decrease. He called Greenwald's editing of such low-quality sound recordings as \\"impressive and even a little bewildering, but the knowledge proves unnecessary.\\" In May 2015, Fact magazine honored the record as one of their favorite Bandcamp releases for the month of April, and on their year-end list of \\"20 best Bandcamp releases\\", it was ranked number 19. In The Fader's \\"Top 2 Reasons Guitar Center Still Shreds\\", No Stairway was number two and Live at Guitar Center topped the list.

Following an early access beta phase, the game was released for Linux, Microsoft Windows, and Xbox One on October 5, 2017. The Culling initially was popular, but in the wake of two other battle royale games, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds and Fortnite Battle Royale, the player base for The Culling waned, and Xaviant halted future development in December 2017. The company later announced a sequel, The Culling 2, which was released in July 2018, amid the popularity of Fortnite Battle Royale. It was panned by players and lacked sufficient players for full matches within 19 hours, leading Xaviant to pull the sequel from marketplaces, and instead restart work on adapting The Culling as a free-to-play title. The game servers were finally shut down on May 15, 2019, with the game no longer being purchasable on any platforms.  Gameplay  Sixteen players are placed in an arena (either a small island or a prison) full of various buildings containing loot. The maps contain caves, bridges, poison gas, explosive barrels, and more. Upon completing various tasks such as living for a few minutes, killing other players, traveling certain distances or interacting with the environment, players receive \\"F.U.N.C\\", which is the name of the in-game currency used to craft or purchase equipment and upgrades each match. When particular perks and air drops are put together they provide unique strengths and weaknesses. Players call these combinations \\"builds\\". Selecting the correct perks can provide players with an edge based on their play style.  Development  The Culling was developed by Xaviant. Having finished Lichdom: Battlemage, they saw the popularity of mods that created a battle royale game atop existing games. The Culling was envisioned to be the first standalone battle royale game on Steam, with the potential to tap into the esports market. The game, as developed, required players that had been killed off to remain in the match, which necessitated the need for Xaviant to provide a robust spectator mode for these players to watch the remaining match play out. Late in the development process, they also recognized this would help the popularity of the game in video game live streaming. Xaviant first announced The Culling in February 2016. After a brief closed alpha period, the game was released into early access on Windows via Steam on March 4, 2016, where it quickly rose to one of the top ten games played on Steam according to Steam Spy. In March 2017, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds was released on Steam in early access. Battlegrounds was another battle royale game which gained popularity quickly over the next year. This caused The Cullings player counts to drop significantly after May 2017. In December 2017, Xaviant announced that development for the game was halting, so that they could work on \\"a new title\\". Xaviant left The Culling servers open for players to continue to use. =Sequel and reboot= In mid-June 2018, Xaviant announced it was preparing to release a sequel, The Culling 2, which they had been working on since stopping development of the first game. At this point in time, Fortnite Battle Royale had been released and surpassed the popularity of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, and Xaviant's decision to release The Culling 2 in the oversaturated market was questioned. Xaviant's director of operations Josh Van Veld believed that the timing was right, as it had been about two years since The Cullings initial release, making it a fresh title, and that The Culling 2 would be released without an early access period. The announcement came around the same time that leaked images from The Culling 2 had been discovered, with fans of the first game criticizing the look and feel for being too close to PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds. Van Veld said the choice to make the game more similar to Battlegrounds was to reflect the trend that the battle royale genre had seen over the last two years. Within The Culling 2, match sizes were increased to 50 players. The Culling 2 was released on July 10, 2018 for Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. The game was criticized by players for appearing to be an unfinished title, its release timed to hit the middle of the popularity of battle royale games. Additionally, the release occurred on the same day as the start of a new season within Fortnite: Battle Royale. Steam peak player counts for the game on its first day were around 250 players and within 40 hours the game dropped to a single player. On July 18, 2018, Xaviant decided to pull The Culling 2 from storefronts, close down its servers and refund all purchases. Additionally, Xaviant stated they would instead retake up development and support of the original game towards making it a free-to-play title. The rebooted game, The Culling: Origins, returned The Culling to a state similar to when it was first released on early access in March 2016, including bringing back features that had been removed during its release development, as well as new graphics, features and optimizations featured in the latest build. Anyone who owns the game is granted access to The Culling: Day One, an exact replica of the game in its original state, when it was released in March 2016, with a few bug fixes. The Culling: Day One allows players to replay the game in its earliest form and is to be used as a reference point for the free-to-play release to ensure the game is as fun as its first release so it does not lose what makes it unique. Xavient announced in March 2019 that revenue from the rebooted The Culling was not sufficient to cover their ongoing expenses, and were thus planning on closing down the servers in May 2019; offline portions of the game would otherwise remain playable. On March 25, 2019, the title was made unavailable for purchase on Steam and de-listed from the Xbox Store. On May 12, 2020, Xaviant announced that The Culling would return to Xbox One, re-branded as The Culling: Origins, with a \\"pay-per-match\\" model. Originally, Xaviant Games announced that players could only play one match per day without a token. However, after considerable backlash, it was announced that this would be changed to ten games per day.

Overview At the beginning of Buddhist Lent in July, people gather together at Wat Phra Phuttabat to offer food to the monks. After that, they go out to collect the flower, Dok Khao-Phansa, to offer to the monks in the afternoon respectively. Dok Khao-Phansa is a special kind of flower that only found in the Saraburi province in Central Thailand. The colors of this flower are either white or purple. It blooms during the Buddhist Lent festival which is the reason why it is called Buddhist Lent Flower. In Buddha‚Äôs lifetime, Sumonmala had a duty to collect eight flowers of jasmine for offering to the king of Ratchakuek kingdom, Phra Chao Pimpisarn. One day, Sumonmalal found Buddha and his monks when he picked the flowers for Phra Chao Pimpisarn. Being faithful, he offered the flowers to the Buddha instead of Phra Chao Pimpisarn. However, known the reason, Phra Chao Pimpisarn did not get angry with him. Moreover, he gave the price to Sumonmala which helped him to have a better living afterwards. Long time ago, Dok Khao-Phansa was elegant. It had so many because of the abundance of the forest, the proper amount of rainfall. In addition, no one deforested. As a result, the people could bring them to offer the monk frequently. They went to the forest to collect the flowers together. Then, they packed these flowers with the joss sticks and candles. This activity brought them to be harmonized to each other closely. Nowadays, this ceremony was restored in 1987 which was the year of changing and removing Thai‚Äôs recitation. People took interest in it increasingly. In this ceremony, it is performed in the afternoon of Buddhist Lent Day. People stand in the two long lines with a two-meter space between them. Then, the monks walk in that space to receive the flowers from the people. Afterwards, the monks ascend to the mondop of Wat Phra Phutthabat to the north letting the people to pour water onto their feet to wash away the sins of the people according to their belief. On the occasion, there are folk dances, folk music and exhibitions of the art. There is also a parade of the Lent Candle with long drums moving along the streets to the temple.

This is the celebration in order of Lord Buddha's return to Earth after delivering a semon to his dead mother in heaven.  Etymology  \\"Tak Bat\\" () means \\"to present food to a monk or Buddhist priest\\".‡∏ï‡∏±‡∏Å dtak thai-language.com \\"Devo\\" () is derived from the word \\"Theworona\\" () which is \\"The Buddhas descent from the celestial world\\".‡πÄ‡∏ó‡πÇ‡∏ß‡πÇ‡∏£‡∏´‡∏ô‡∏∞ theworona thai-language.com  The starting point of Tak Bat Thewo  In the seventh year after Lord Buddha's intuition, he decided to give a sermon to his dead mother, Sirimahamaya, in Dusit heaven, so he stayed in the heaven for three months from Khao Phansa day to Ok Phansa day. On Ok Phansa day, the 15th day of the 11th waxing moon, Lord Buddha had come back to Earth and made the miracle that all realms (heaven, human, and hell) can see each other while he was going down. The next morning, most citizens made a big \\"Tak Bat\\" event as they had not seen Lord Buddha for almost three months. That event was originally called \\"Tak Bat Theworohana\\", but as the time passed, it had derived to only \\"Tak Bat Thewo\\". To memorize that event, people made it a festival till now. The meaning of Theworohana Theworohana means coming down from the heaven of Lord Buddha. It is the part of Buddha's life. The legend said that, when he come back, Indra had made three ladders for him (gold, silver, and crystal). Their heads were put on the top of a mountain and their bases were at the door of Sanggas Nakorn city. When Lord Buddha come down, he used the crystal ladder while the angels used gold ladder and the archangels used silver ladder. That is called Theworohana. Special of Tak Bat Thewo Tak Bat Thewo is the special day that they will install the statue of Buddha on a small moving boat and with a monk's alms bowl in the front. There will be some person pulling it slowly while the monks walk in line in the back and the buddish sit on the side and throw the rice balls into that bowl, which is at the front of the statue. Some people will take some sermon in the temple too. Tak Bat Thewo in Thailand In Thailand there are countries which do Tak Bat Thewo festival, such as: #In Uthai Thani at Wat Sangkat Rattanakhiri, there are about 500 monks walking 449 steps of the staircase down from Sakaekrang hill to receive alms from locals and tourists. #In Chon Buri, monks walk in a long line around the Muang district to join Tak Bat Thewo festival. #In Buri Ram, about two thousand people joined in merit-making ritual with 199 monks in this festival.

Other ponds in the Eagle Lake watershed include Woodman Pond via Woodman Brook, Pillsbury Pond and Little Pillsbury Pond via Smith Brook, Soper Pond and Upper Soper Pond via Soper Brook, and the Russell Ponds via Russell Brook.

Ciarrocchi has presented numerous solo exhibitions in New York, additional US cities and Italy as well as dozens of group exhibitions in varied locations and venues. His paintings, watercolors, drawings and monotypes are in many museum and private collections both nationally and abroad. He is married to painter Sandra Caplan. Their daughter Maya Ciarrocchi is an interdisciplinary artist. Background Ray Ciarrocchi, \\"August\\", 2010, oil on linen Ray Ciarrocchi, the son of Italian immigrants from Tuscany and Le Marche, was born Ramon William Ciarrocchi in Chicago, IL on August 23, 1933. As a child he enjoyed drawing and during high school attended classes at the Art Institute of Chicago where he was influenced by the French Impressionists works that form a significant part of the museum's collection. After high school he enrolled and studied for two years at the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts with the idea that he might eventually work as an illustrator. Military service kept him from completing his studies but brought valuable experience as Ciarrocchi was assigned to three years duty in Tokyo, Japan as an illustrator. In Tokyo he was fortunate to meet and become friends with the writer Oliver Statler, who introduced him to Isamu Noguchi and the British ceramist Bernard Leach. Studying Zen painting and attending performances and sketching at the Kabuki Theatre with its splendid color were influential in Ciarrocchi's decision to become a painter. Following his discharge from the army, Ciarrocchi returned to college and earned a BFA from Washington University where he studied painting with Fred Conway and guest critic Stephen Pace. Pace, who later became a friend and mentor, was a strong influence imparting, among other things, his knowledge of Hans Hoffman‚Äôs visual concepts. Ciarrocchi went on to receive an MFA at Boston University where he studied with David Aaronson. While at Boston University he established rapport with fellow students Brice Marden and Kent Floeter. Moving to New York City during 1961, Ciarrocchi continued painting as an abstract expressionist, influenced by DeKooning‚Äôs black and white period. He became acquainted with several of the painters who were associated with the Howard Wise Gallery including Edward Dugmore and Ernest Briggs. A Fulbright Grant during 1963-64 made possible a year‚Äôs study and independent work in Florence, Italy. Seeing first-hand the work of artists Piero della Francesca and the Venetians Giorgione and Veronese, strongly influenced Ciarrocchi‚Äôs visual thinking. Living in Fiesole, above Florence, he began to draw and paint from nature, stressing the abstract figuration of the natural forms. The warm bright quality of the Italian light became a standard component of his work that continues in his current paintings. Ciarrocchi, even when working abstractly, continued to draw from the nude. His acquaintance with Gregory Gillespie, another Fulbright artist, provided numerous discussions concerning the possibilities of figurative painting. Returning to New York he was able to draw from life with groups of artists including Diana Kurz, Lois Dodd and Regina Granne. He also established friendships with Jack Tworkov, Hermine Ford , Robert Moskowitz, Lennart Anderson, Sonia Gechtoff and Rackstraw Downes. After his return to New York from Italy Ciarrocchi saw and was influenced by a large exhibition of Bonnard‚Äôs paintings held at Acquavella Gallery. Additional painters whose works he studies are Vuillard, Fairfield Porter, Edwin Dickinson and Filippo DePisis. During summers spent in Maine, Ciarrocchi began to work and complete each painting directly from nature. Ciarrocchi now develops his paintings in the studio working from sketches and studies made at various sites as he divides his time between New York and Italy. Career Ray Ciarrocchi, \\"Cliffs\\", 2014, charcoal and white pastel on paper, 25\\" x 33\\" Ciarrocchi's first one-person exhibition was with the Tibor DeNagy Gallery during 1971. This was followed by seven additional exhibitions at the same gallery, the last taking place in 1985.https://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/raymond- ciarrocchi-papers-15941 Other exhibitions were with Fischbach Gallery, 1987 and 1989 and with Rich Perlow Gallery during l993 and l996. Ciarrocchi continues to exhibit both nationally and abroad. An exhibition entitled \\"Seeking the Darkness and the Light: Drawings of Italy,\\" was held at the University of Richmond, Virginia in February 2015. Lawrence Campbell, writing in ArtNews magazine about one of Ciarrocchi's exhibitions stated, \\"Ciarrocchi improvises brilliantly on natural textures---the foliage of trees, clouds and flower-bespattered meadows. Continually, the Natural edges into the Symbolist, shifting between the seen and the unseen.\\" Richard Waller, in his catalog essay for \\"Ray Ciarrocchi: Landscapes 1978-91,\\" at University of Richmond Museums, writes: \\" Ciarrocchi‚Äôs landscapes are more about the exquisite moment of being in that place. His landscapes are at once aesthetic and metaphysical, achieving a unity of viewing nature with the transcendent power of that experience.\\" As a teacher Ciarrocchi has held positions at Pratt Institute, Columbia University, Parsons School of Design, Brooklyn College CUNY and Baruch College CUNY. He was a visiting artist at Maryland Institute College of Art and at the University of Guelph, Ontario, Canada.

Biography Born Clara Lee Fraps in Biscoe, North Carolina, the daughter of Joseph Conrad Fraps, a railroad machinist, and his wife, Clara Dargon Lee Fraps, she moved with her family to Tucson, Arizona, at the age of two. She graduated from the University of Arizona with a double major in English and archaeology, in 1927, the first year that an archaeology major was offered. Her teacher in the latter field was Byron Cummings, who had steadily developed the department of archaeology at the university since his arrival in 1915.Thompson, Raymond H. (2005). \\"Anthropology at the University of Arizona, 1893-2005.\\" Journal of the Southwest. Vol. 47, no. 3, p. 327-74; here: p. 329-331. Available via JSTOR: (registration required). With Cummings's encouragement, she went on to graduate study, and, in 1928, became one of the university's first three recipients of master's degrees in archaeology, along with fellow students Florence May Hawley and Emil Walter Haury. In her master's thesis, initially entitled \\"Hopiland\\" and ultimately submitted under the title \\"Archaeological Survey of Arizona,\\"Browman, David L. (2013).

Fraps (Tanner) received an appointment as a lecturer in the archaeology department at the University of Arizona for the fall semester 1928, and continued to teach there over the course of her career, becoming an assistant professor in 1935, associate professor in 1957, and full professor in 1968; she retired with the title of professor emerita in 1978.\\"Clara L(ee) Tanner.\\" Contemporary Authors Online.

She pursued further graduate work at the National University in Mexico City, in 1929, and the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, in 1934. In 1936 she married John Frederick Tanner, the proprietor of an Indian craft store in Tucson. Her involvement in her husband's work was one influence that shifted her research interests in the direction of regional cultural anthropology. In 1937, when Cummings retired and his former student, Emil Haury, took over as chair of the department, Haury initiated a change in its name to the Department of Anthropology, to reflect the breadth of scholarly activities it had come to encompass; he also aimed to expand it to include social anthropology, applied anthropology, and ethnology.\\"History: Haury and the Department of Anthropology.\\" University of Arizona, School of Anthropology. Retrieved 2016-05-29. Haury asked Tanner to develop a course on Southwest ethnology and archaeology. From around this time she began to focus her research on Southwest Indian arts, crafts, and ethnology. Tanner had regularly taken part in the university's summer excavation programs, and conducted archaeological and ethnological research at San Carlos and at the Tanque Verde ruins, a site of prehistoric dwellings. Later, in the interest of her research she traveled extensively throughout the Southwest; besides conducting archaeological studies she visited Native American craftspeople to observe them at work. From 1938 to 1949 Tanner served as the editor of Kiva, the journal of the Arizona Archaeological and Historical Society (affiliated with the Arizona State Museum), devoted to Southwestern archaeology, anthropology and history. Clara and John Tanner had one child, a daughter, Sandra Lee (married: Elers), born in 1940. Out of concern for her family life, Tanner never completed a Ph.D., despite having accumulated additional graduate credits, and that lack may have slowed her promotion to full professor; Emil Haury, the department chair through the mid 1960s, regarded her as influential in the department, for having achieved \\"recognition through her writing\\".Lytle-Webb (1989), p. 352. Quotation from the author's interview with Haury. She was the author of some eight books and more than 100 articles published in scholarly journals, magazines, and newspapers. Reviewing her book Southwest Indian Craft Arts in 1969, archaeologist Neil Judd noted her expertise in the handicrafts of approximately two dozen ethnic groups of the region, and found that the book, with its meticulously accurate illustrations, successfully conveyed the changes in crafts over two generations.Judd, Neil M.

Photostatins are a form of photopharmacology. As a cell prepares to divide, its microtubules, arrange themselves into a spindle that permits its chromosomes to split into two bundles. These bundles become the nuclei of the daughter cells, Out-of-control cell replication is the underlying cause of cancer, developing drugs that interfere with microtubule activity offers one potential therapeutic approach. They can operate microtubule dynamics with a subsecond response time and control mitosis in living organisms with single-cell spatial precision. Most microtubule inhibitors affect both cancerous and healthy cells, requiring lower doses to avoid severe side effects. Because photostatins are inactive in the absence of light, they only affect cells that are illuminated. Focusing light on tumors directs their activities to appropriate targets with fewer side effects.  Combretastatin A-4  One phostatin is combretastatin A-4, one of several combretastatins found in the bark of the South African bushwillow. It comes in two isomers, that share a single composition, but different shapes. One isomer is a poor disrupter of tubule activity while the other is effective. Replacing two adjacent carbon atoms in the molecule with nitrogen atoms changes the non-toxic isomer, which does little to disrupt tubules, into the toxic one in the presence of blue light. This transformation is reversed simply by switching the light off. The drug proved 200 times more toxic when exposed to light in this way than in the dark. The effect increased to 250 times under violet light and decreased to 75 times when exposed to cyan.

At Treasury, among other posts, he served as the Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence where he gained the nickname of ‚Äúsanctions guru‚Äù. Early life and education Cohen is the son of a Boston physician. He graduated from Cornell University in 1985 and went on to receive a Juris Doctor from Yale Law School in 1989. After graduating from law school, Cohen served as a law clerk for federal judge Norman P. Ramsey for the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. Career Cohen (left) in Seoul with Republic of Korea First Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Kim Kyou-hyun in 2013 Following his clerkship, Cohen began his law career at the firm Miller, Cassidy, Larroca & Lewin, a ‚Äúcriminal-defense boutique‚Äù in Washington, D.C. He specialized in white-collar criminal defense and civil litigation. He was hired by the U.S. Treasury Department in 1999 as an aide to General Counsel Neal S. Wolin and then as Acting Deputy General Counsel. While there he was credited by department officials with \\"crafting legislation that formed the basis\\" of Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act, dealing with money laundering. In 2001 he left the government and joined the Washington law firm Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr, now known as WilmerHale. He practiced there for seven years, becoming partner in 2004. His practice areas included complex civil litigation, white-collar criminal defense, internal investigations, and anti- money laundering and sanctions compliance. In 2009, President Barack Obama nominated Cohen to be Assistant Secretary for Terrorist Financing in the Treasury Department, and the U.S. Senate confirmed him on May 1, 2009. Variously described by members of the Obama administration as a \\"financial Batman\\" and one of the president's \\"favorite combatant commanders\\" he was, two years later, nominated and confirmed as Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence. In that role, he \\"preside[d] over a 700-person, $200 million-a-year counterterrorism office within Treasury that was created after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks\\" and includes the Office of Foreign Assets Control, which implements U.S. economic sanctions. During his Senate confirmation hearing, Cohen singled-out the government of Kuwait for rebuke, noting that \\"we have a real challenge with the Kuwaiti government. Kuwait is the only government in the Gulf Cooperation Council that does not criminalize terrorist financing.\\" The following year, Cohen appeared as speaker at the annual forum of the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies. In 2015 Cohen was appointed Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. At the time of his appointment, some speculated that Cohen's selection was due to the Obama administration's reluctance in picking someone with ties to past incidences of CIA torture and extraordinary rendition. The post of deputy director has traditionally been filled by military officers or intelligence community veterans. Personal life Cohen is married with two children.

It was first formally described in 1864 by Joseph Dalton Hooker. It is endemic to New Zealand. The plant is commonly known by its MƒÅori name tutƒÅhuna and as the true vegetable sheep, suggesting its appearance at a distance resembling a sheep. Description On the vegetable sheep only the buds, that never unfold, can be seen externally because their stems are so branched, and have small woolly leaves that are disposed on the extremity of the twigs in a closely tight way. The dense, hard and convex shape of Raoulia eximia formed by its compressed structures, according to Cockayne it makes ‚Äúan excellent and appropriate seat for a wearied botanist‚Äù. The species of Raoulia can be easily mystified because of the overall resemblance in general appearance, despite being taxonomically distinct. Raoulia eximia, the Canterbury vegetable sheep, usually found on rock outcrops has grey to grey-green colouration and narrow buds. Hook.f. describe the species as a rigid plant that form large woolly balls on the mountains covered in soft, velvety, white tomentum. ‚ÄúLeaves most densely compacted, wholly hidden amongst woolly hairs, imbricated all round in many series, 1/8 in. long, membranous, broadly linear- or obovate-oblong, rounded at the tip, bearing at the back above the middle a dense thick pencil of white velvety hairs, these bundles of hairs, meeting beyond the leaves, envelope the whole‚Äù.

Achenes hardly 1 mm. long, clad in long silky hairs; pappus-hairs rigid‚Äù Distribution About 93 percent of the alpine plants are just found at New Zealand Biological Region. New Zealand has only a few alpine gerena among all the alpines genera and usually they are the less notable members, except for Raoulia. The light- coloured cushions of the true vegetable sheep can be found on the drier fellfiels located on the east of the Southern Alps, between north Otago and southern Nelson-Marlborough, from mid-Canterbury to north Otago and in the S.

Habitat preference The formation of soils on the mountains is high because the wind-blown material, but the constant strong wings, cold summers and frequent freeze-thaw cycles draw off all the soil formed. The plants in the alpine zone, like R. eximia, are exposed to high moisture on the soil, except in frozen times. However the excess of humidity, which increases with rainfall, make the more acidic and also provoke the leaching of nutrients. R. eximia can be found in raw soils, with low nutrient concentrations: mean total phosphorus (P) was 69.5 mg¬∑kg-1, and total nitrogen (N) was 0.04%.

Kambol√© has a population of about 50,000 residents. The people of the town speak Ede Nago, of the Manigri-Kambole variety.http://archive.ethnologue.com/15/show_country.asp?name=TG History The foundation of the village dates back to between the 16th and 17th centuries. From Nigeria, the founder, Ode Amon came from Il√© Ife (Il√© Ifan language Yoruba), cradle of the Anago language. A Descendant of Odoudouwa, Ode Amon was a renowned hunter, hence its name: Ode Amon, that is to say, \\"the hunter we know better, or the renowned hunter \\"in Yoruba language. For reasons of social insecurity, Ode Amon left Il√© If√® and after several stopovers in (Idjiho in Nigeria, Sav√® and Igbomakoh in Dahomey (now Benin) along the river Ofe (current Ou√©m√© River)). He arrived at Katankou where he established his first camp with his followers. During a hunting party south of the Katankou forest area, he found a clearing where he installed a crossing site, later named Oke Gengele which means \\"Hill\\" in Yoruba. He let his fighter aid and down along a river to a wild trough called Kpokpo Yaa, whose source Gu√©ngu√©l√©. He saw a herd of elephants taking a drink. The rifle he charged was intended for small game with the intent to kill just for the evening meal. In desperation, he fired it anyway and discovered that he had killed one of them. Delighted, he cut off his tail and up the river to find his result. When he arrived, his hunter wanted to help find out what killed him. He held up the tail of the elephant. Help hunter remarked that the game was too big for the evening meal. Ode Amon back along another river named \\"Odo Nkpokou\\", now called \\"Atan EDI\\" (water reservoir (Atan) which pushes a water plant that serves arrow door (EDI)) . There he saw buffalo and killed a he extracted hoses for their evening meal. The next day, he returned to his camp at Katankou where he related his adventure to his brother Olou Adjif√¥. On the recommendation of his brother, they invited the community to help Lofoi dissecting the loot. Thereafter Ode Amon showed his brother his intention to settle in the area he had discovered (Gu√©ngu√©l√©). The latter then advised him to give it a poultry couple (a rooster and a hen) to test the livability of the area. But before letting the poultry at the place, he implored the gods of the medium in these terms: \\"If this place is habitable, this hen procreated, otherwise I discovered the remains.\\" Back in Katankou, he traveled to the Gold Coast (Ghana) for the sale of ivory. He stopped over the edge of Anyigan and went in alone for a field trip. He then sat under a tree behind the house of a hunter he will know later. Indeed, appearing suspicious and scary, the village children alerted their parents. This is none other Ode Agou√© by a particular sign, acknowledged that Ode Amon was also a hunter. He then requested and granted their hospitality during their stay in Anyigan. In their discussion, Ode Agou√© made it clear to his host that he was not comfortable in his current residence area and would be happy to live with if he proves he is a more hospitable site. Ode promised Amaoun give him an answer on his return and then continued his journey to Ghana. Further, he met the Ashanti (Adobia, Tak√©t√© and Awoyo), fleeing wars. He promised them assistance upon return. As promised, he found the Ashanti where he had left them and led them to Alibi come to warn his brother and then organize their installation. At Katankou, he shared his meetings with his brother. Olou Adjif√¥ recalled him to go check his poultry on the site Gu√©ngu√©l√©. There he struck some dry wood or shook a gourd containing sorghum other to bring out the chickens. They came out with more new chicks. Hence the new future of the village neighborhoods. He then concludes that the area was hospitable and went the news to his brother. They then returned to build the first huts (ab√©h√©ma in Yoruba language). He gave the name Aboliya to his hamlet, which means \\"we are freed from suffering.\\" Some time later, he sent a delegation for his friend Ode Agou√© of Aniyagan. He replied that it was impossible for him to come because he had lost his wife. Ode Amon then decided to give him his daughter in marriage and returns search again. Ode Agou√© asked for time to gather his things. It took a third delegation to lead to Ode Agou√© Aboliya today Kambol√© hence the nickname given to this community Amuyanwa that is to say \\"we brought people.\\" He installed them at the feet of the hill of Gu√©ngu√©l√©, Djobor√© current quarter.

Phytogeographically, Finland is shared between sosput, central European, and northern European provinces of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom. The territory of Finland can be subdivided into three ecoregions: the Scandinavian and Russian taiga, Sarmatic mixed forests, and Scandinavian Montane Birch forest and grasslands. Taiga covers most of Finland from northern regions of southern provinces to the north of Lapland. On the southwestern coast, south of the Helsinki-Rauma line, forests are characterized by mixed forests, that are more typical in the Baltic region. In the extreme north of Finland, near the tree line and Arctic Ocean, Montane Birch forests are common.  Habitat types  Cloudberry flowers at mire in Utaj√§rvi. The habitat types of Finland have been divided in eight groups by prevailing environmental conditions, and by the plant and animal species typical of such areas. The groups consist of habitat types of the Baltic Sea, its coast, inland waters and shores, mires, forests, rocky habitats, traditional rural biotopes and fell habitats.  Species  Whooper swan, the national bird Silver birch, the national tree Lily of the valley, the national flower The number of species living in Finland has been estimated to be at least 45 000\\\\.

The most seriously endangered habitats are 52, of which over half are traditional rural biotopes, such as meadows. The threat assessment was based on changes in the number and quality of the habitat type from the 1950s to the 2000s.

Unable to bear the harassment anymore, the victim lodged written reports against the accused as well as his family members. Apparently no action was taken against the culprits. The victim made representations to various authorities and organizations for her redress. Meanwhile, the accused went on harassing her in various ways to back off or withdrawal of the complaints. The allegations further disclose that on 27.10.2013 at about 9.20 PM when the victim was listening to music, an unknown culprit entered the room of the victim and threatened her to withdraw the cases against the accused persons. When she declined, the culprit poured kerosene on her & set her ablaze. A very badly burnt Itishree was taken to the PHC, Tikiri. The Medical Officer administered preliminary treatments and apprehending her imminent demise, recorded her dying declaration. The victim was referred to District Headquarters Hospital for specialized treatment. The matter was reported to Police and the Tahasildar-cum-Executive Magistrate, Rayagada also recorded a dying declaration. The deceased was thereafter referred to Seven Hills Hospital at Visakhapatnam where she succumbed to the severe burns on 01.11.2013 at 11.14 A.M.

History  The club was founded in February 1922 from the merger of predecessors Sportverein Viktoria Brackel bei Dortmund and Fu√üball-Club Fortuna 09 Brackel, formed in 1906 and 1909 respectively. These clubs absorbed Brackeler TV Turnklub in May 1920 to form TSK Dortmund-Brackel, but the merger was undone within that year. After World War II SV was dissolved like many sports clubs and later refounded in February 1946. The men's team first qualified for the Landesliga Westfalen (III) in 1955 after a decisive 2-1 win over Alemannia Dortmund for promotion from the Bezirksklasse (IV). By virtue of a second-to-last position SV remained in the new fourth-tier Landesliga when the Verbandsliga Westfalen was introduced in 1956 as the highest league in Westphalia. The club was relegated in 1958 then entered a period of obscurity in the lower leagues for the next decades. In 2000 SV returned to the Landesliga (VI) but went down once again to spend the next 13 years in the Bezirksliga. Two titles and promotions in three preceding seasons put the men's players back to the Westfalenliga in 2015. = Women's team = SV was joined by the women's team of neighboring TSC Eintracht Dortmund in 1975 after they seceded from that club over internal disputes. They first won promotion to the Regionalliga West (I) in 1986 and remained there after the Frauen-Bundesliga was created in 1990. In 1994 they finished runners-up to champions SG Wattenscheid 09 Frauen and qualified in the promotion round against FTSV Lorbeer Rothenburgsort, but financial shortcomings forced them to withdraw from participation. The next seasons saw them shuffle between mediocrity and relegation battles until a last place dropped them to the Frauen-Westfalenliga (III) in 2000, but the club folded its women's side. A new women's team was refounded in 2010 and it now plays in the Kreisliga A Dortmund (VII). SV won the women's Westphalia Cup in 1996 and finished runners-up five times. Three of those runners-up finishes qualified them for the women's German Cup where they had three appearances and their best finish in the cup was the second round in 1993‚Äì94 when they were smothered by TSV Siegen 0‚Äì9, after tripping Bundesliga side KBC Duisburg 2‚Äì0.

The episode was written by executive producer Naren Shankar and co-executive producer Sarah Goldfinger, and was directed by Clark Mathis. Plot Opening quote: \\"'Little pig, little pig, let me come in,' said the wolf to the pig. 'Not by the hair of my chinny chin chin,' said the pig to the wolf.\\" A man, Hap Lasser (Brad William Henke), is working out with a Shake Weight but he accidentally throws it out of the window. When he goes to retrieve it, his house explodes. When Nick (David Giuntoli) and Hank (Russell Hornsby) interrogate him, Nick sees Hap shift into a Blutbad. Hap states that his brother died in a similar fire the month before. Later, while interrogating him in the police station, Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell) shows up, as he's Hap's emergency contact. Monroe takes Hap to his home. Nick passes by to check up on Hap and is attacked by Hap's sister, Angelina (Jaime Ray Newman), a former love interest of Monroe. Monroe sends Nick home and he and Angelina go to the woods where they have sex. Meanwhile, a creature in the shape of a pig appears in Monroe's house and kills Hap. After questioning Angelina, Sgt. Wu (Reggie Lee) tells Nick and Hank that Angelina may be responsible for arson investigator Orson's (Daniel Roebuck) brothers' death. Nick sees that Orson is a Bauerschwein. Monroe then reveals to Nick that the Bauerschwein and the Blutbaden have a centuries-old feud. Angelina arrives at the police station, looking for Orson, certain he killed Hap. She attacks an officer and escapes after Orson is nowhere to be found. Nick goes to Orson's house, where he states he has no interest in causing trouble with a Grimm. Angelina appears and attacks Orson. Nick manages to beat her but she disappears. Orson is taken to the hospital and arrested for the murders of Hap and his brother. The episode ends as Monroe receives a smashed framed picture of Angelina's family on his porch. Reception =Viewers= The episode was broadcast on December 9. It was viewed by 5.43 million people, earning a 1.6/5 in the 18-49 rating demographics on the Nielson ratings scale, marking a 32% increase in viewership and ranking first in its timeslot and fourth for the night in the 18-49 demographics, behind Frosty Returns, Dateline NBC and Frosty the Snowman. This means that 1.6 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode, while 5 percent of all households watching television at that time watched it. =Critical reviews= \\"The Three Bad Wolves\\" received positive reviews. Amy Ratcliffe of IGN gave the episode a \\"great\\" 8.5 out of 10 and wrote \\"I hope Grimm brings more episodes like this one. The combination of the supernatural and procedural elements was just right, and the conflict felt legitimate. It was far superior to just another bizarre murder case. For the first time, I felt like I really connected with some of the characters (Nick and Monroe). More, please.\\" The A.V. Club's Kevin McFarland gave the episode a \\"B+\\" grade and wrote, \\"'Three Bad Wolves' was the fourth episode of Grimm in production order, so the fact that it was airing sixth made me a little nervous. I thought we wouldn't be getting much in terms of backstory, and pushing this hour back in the schedule isn't exactly a vote of confidence. Still, I couldn't help but feel optimistic, because all the previews featured Eddie Monroe and a murderous family feud between the Blutbaden and the Bowerswine, an unexpectedly clever take on 'The Three Little Pigs' tale. Instead of a weaker hour, this was perhaps the best episode of Grimm thus far, managing to bring some of the disparate unnecessary elements of the show into the central plot, a case of the week that included new characters and created a stronger bond between Nick and Eddie.\\" TV Overmind's Shilo Adams wrote, \\"'The Three Bad Wolves' was a solid but unremarkable installment of Grimm that was another stylistic shift in terms of look, tone, and approach to such an intriguing concept. The show has been a little frantic with its trips around the stylistic map, dabbling in camp, dark humor, just plain darkness, and now police procedural, with positives and negatives coming from each experiment in identity. Its venture in the world of true police dramas didn't make for the most exciting episode in the world thanks to the almost too straightforward presentation, but 'The Three Bad Wolves' did one thing extremely, extremely right. It gave Silas Weir Mitchell a very good showcase to expand his character and show us what's behind the neurotic, wry facade of Eddie Monroe, a man caught between the world of humanity and the call of the wild.\\" Nick McHatton from TV Fanatic, gave a 4.2 star rating out of 5, stating: \\"Finally! The Grimm Gods have bestowed us with an Eddie-centric episode in 'The Three Bad Wolves.' It certainly wasn't a disappointment, either, shining a spotlight on this character with very little need to deviate from the case of the week with unnecessary distractions. When the storytelling can layer this much in a procedural case, it gives me hope that the questions I'm asking will eventually get answered.\\" References External links * * Category:Grimm (season 1) episodes Category:2011 American television episodes ","title":"The Three Bad Wolves"},{"id":"50380245","text":"Victor Koning by Georges Camus.

She is also known for her Torah lectures, motivational speeches, and weekly newsletters. Biography =Early life= Kineret was born in Israel. Her parents, both professional musicians, met in Italy and played in a band together. Due to their constant touring, she lived primarily with her maternal grandmother, Sarah, a religious Jew of Moroccan and Iraqi heritage who traced her lineage to the famous Sephardic rabbi Ben Ish Hai. While Kineret's mother was strictly secular, her grandmother exposed her to practices such as Shabbat and kashrut. When she was six, she and her parents moved to Queens, New York. She attended P.S. 13, where she performed in school productions and was in the school band. She applied to Louis Armstrong Middle School but was disqualified after she was caught skipping class, and instead attended Yeshiva Academy of South Queens under Rabbi Zalman Deutscher. She also spent a summer at Camp Sternberg; both locations deepened her commitment to Judaism. When her parents moved again to California, she remained in New York, boarding with the family of noted posek Rabbi Noach Isaac Oelbaum and attending Shevach High School. =Career= She was encouraged by Rabbi Nuta Waidenbaum of Milk and Honey Productions to make a career in Jewish music and gave her first women-only performance during a Chanukkah production at Brooklyn College when she was 18. She released her first album, The Inspiration, in 1998, and has since released six more albums and two concert DVDS. Her third album, How Come, How Long?, was dedicated to victims of the September 11 attacks and includes covers of songs by Yehuda!, Mendy Wald, and Shloime Dachs. Her most recent album is Reach Out released in 2007. In the summer of 2011, she performed at a Shas-sponsored women's conference in Tel Aviv. She has received vocal training from Dr. William Riley, coach of Luciano Pavarotti and Celine Dion. In addition to her music career, Kineret is a motivational speaker and life coach. She is the founder of the outreach organization Ohel Sara, which provides Jewish learning opportunities to women and girls new to Judaism. The organization is named after Kineret's grandmother and was encouraged early on by Rebbetzin Rachel Baraness and the late Rav Ovadia Yosef.

Early colonization Abdur Rahman Khan, the Amir of Afghanistan (1880‚Äì1901) British Major Charles Yate, a supporter of the Pashtun colonization of northern Afghanistan. An early 21st century ethnolinguistic map of Afghanistan. The light green Pashtun areas in the north are the result of Pashtun colonization. The ethnic Pashtun population in northern Afghanistan was almost nonexistent when Amir Abdur Rahman Khan's came to power in 1880. During his reign, Abdur Rahman Khan initiated a process of ethnic Pashtun settlement and colonization called Pashtunization in northern Afghanistan. These Pashtun colonization policies had three major purposes: to strengthen the Pashtun-dominated government's hold on the Persian-speaking people living in the northern territories, to allow Afghan governments to deport their opponents to the north (where they would be comparatively less able to cause trouble to the government), and to help supposedly economically develop northern Afghanistan. Abdur Rahman himself stated that since the King of Afghanistan is Pashtun, Pashtuns should watch over the Afghan-Russian frontier. In order to achieve this goal, both Abdur Rahman Khan and his successors utilized the confiscation of land from the Persian-speaking non-Pashtuns of north, Pashtun nationalist ideology, pro-Pashtun forced resettlement, and taxation policies that were discriminatory against the many non-Pashtun tribes living in the north. The British government supported the Pashtun colonization of northern Afghanistan due to Britain's desire to reduce Russian influence in Afghanistan (see the Great Game). In 1893, British Major Charles Yate wrote that only the non- Pashtun tribes have any contact and interactions with the Russians, and that surrounding these tribes with Pashtuns would end these tribes' interactions with the Russians. The Pashtun colonization of northern Afghanistan allowed Abdur Rahman Khan to strengthen his rule over the non-Pashtun lands in Afghan Turkestan. In addition to this, this Pashtun colonization resulted in Pashtun settlers acquiring the best land in northern Afghanistan at the expense of the Tajiks, Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks, and other peoples who previously owned this land. While all of the Pashtuns who migrated to northern Afghanistan before 1885 had done so involuntarily (often exiled for opposing the policies of the Afghan government), this changed after 1885, when Abdur Rahman began offering incentives for ethnic Pashtuns to voluntarily settle in northern Afghanistan (while also making this migration one-way by issuing a decree in 1885 which forbade any migration in the other direction). Ethnic Pashtuns who voluntarily migrated to northern Afghanistan often had their travel expenses paid for and were given animals, free land, and a three-year exemption from taxes. Abdur Rahman's policies of encouraging Pashtuns to settle in northern Afghanistan voluntarily ended up achieving more success than previous attempts at forced settlement (especially involuntary attempts which involved nomads). However, in spite of the incentive-based voluntary migration in force in 1885, many ethnic Pashtuns ended up being deported to northern Afghanistan even after 1885 (in some cases as late as the 1940s). Between 1885 and 1888, the Pashtun population in northern Afghanistan have increased eight-fold from 3,500 Pashtun families in 1885 to 40,000 Pashtun families in 1888. Rebellions such as the Ghilzai Pashtuns' rebellions in eastern Afghanistan and Sardar Muhammad Ishaq's rebellion temporarily stopped Pashtun colonization of northern Afghanistan in the late 1880s. Afterwards, despite another short period of colonization, the Hazara War broke out in the early 1890s, ending the Pashtunization of northern Afghanistan during Abdur Rahman‚Äôs reign (1880‚Äì1901) (though it would resume under Abdur Rahman's successors after his death). Later colonization Between the 1910s and the 1940s, many ethnic Pashtun herders settled in Afghan Turkestan. From the 1930s to the 1970s, after the ethnically Tajik Habibullah Kalakani attempted and failed to seize power in Afghanistan in 1929, ethnic Uzbeks and ethnic Tajiks lost hundreds of thousands of acres of pasture and cultivated land in northern Afghanistan. Afterwards, this land was sold or outright given to ethnic Pashtun settlers, further increasing Pashtun influence in northern Afghanistan. During this time, Pashtun settlers in Takhar Province pushed, Tajik, Hazaral, and Qarluq farmers as well as Uzbek herders out of irrigated lowlands and into foothills with little agricultural value. As a result of the 19th and 20th century Pashtun colonization policies that Afghan governments pursued, Pashtuns became the dominant ethnic group in the developed agricultural areas in northern Afghanistan, while other ethnic groups (especially the Uzbeks) came to dominate in the underdeveloped foothills. By the start of the 1970s, ethnic Pashtuns constituted 56% of the total population in the former Tajik-dominated Baghlan area, 61% of the total population in the Puli Khumri area (capital of Baghlan), 41% of the total population in the Tajik-plurality Kunduz area, 45% of the total population in the Khanabad area, and just 10% of the total population in the Uzbek-majority Taloqan area.

After seeing an old Indonesian classic literature book he used to read, he remembers his high school lover Cinta (Dian Sastrowardoyo). Using LINE's find alumni feature, he contacts Cinta. In Jakarta, Cinta, now works in a magazine company, meets up with her high school gang that consists of Karmen (Adinia Wirasti), Maura (Titi Kamal), Milly (Sissy Priscillia), and Alya (Ladya Cheryl). Cinta tell the ladies that Rangga contacted her, much to everyone's surprise. To their disappointment, Rangga does not use his photo as a profile picture. After being confused on what to say, Cinta ask him what's up with him. He ask her to meet him, which she didn't respond. Maura supports her decision as she think what he's done by showing up after 12 years being gone just isn't right. Alya, however, is the only one who realize that Cinta is torn inside (just as Alya is the only one knew Cinta likes Rangga in the original film). Cinta decides to delete all of Rangga's messages. Rangga, disappointed, text her an apology. He has to return to the U.S. and are about to board his plane, but what ends in the airport also ends in the airport. Cinta suddenly appears and ask him if a full moon in New York is different from one in Jakarta (Rangga said that he will return in the next full moon in the first film). They approach each other and share a smile.

It is located at the point where the River Lee descends from the mountains and widens at an alluvial plain, and stretches for roughly five kilometres, bounded by the townlands of Toonsbridge, Illaunmore and Anahala. It was until recently densely populated with ancient oak trees and the last surviving full oak forest in western Europe. Its Irish name, An Gaoire, is derived from the Irish word Gaorthadh, roughly the Wooden River. It was flooded in 1954 to facilitate the building of two hydro-electric dams in Carrigadrohid and Inniscarra, which provide electricity for the nearby city of Cork. The area is now part of the plants' upper reservoir. The development required the flooding of the region; consequently, hundreds of trees were felled and many people were relocated. Many of the trees were centuries old and had grown since the medieval period.Wood, 136 Today only their stumps survive, in flood land, giving the area a ghostly and almost lunar appearance.

She focuses her research on artistic storytelling and how people can make their stake in the world through doing so.https://www.uwb.edu/ias/faculty-and-staff/anida-yoeu-ali =Buddhism in Artwork= Anida Yoeu Ali's work The Buddhist Bug, Into the Night (2015) and her earlier works, including \\"The Old Cinema\\" (2014), extends from her Buddhist Bug series of photographs, videos and live performances. In these works, the artist playfully inhabits a sinuous, caterpillar-like costume whose color references the robes of Buddhist monks, in which the bug is also not given a specific gender to be \\"hybrid in nature\\". Ali's bug was inspired by her fascination with Buddhism and the exploration of diasporic identities. The project developed when Ali returned to her birthplace of Cambodia as a means of inhabiting and recording Cambodia's changing rural and metropolitan landscapes, and of negotiating her culturally mixed background. The series depicts an art deco cinema, Golden Temple, to make reference to what was known as the \\"Golden Era\\" of Cambodian Cinema, a period which the younger generation looks back on fondly and is depicted as so in the series, in which the Buddhist Bug tries to find identity and \\"otherness\\". The bug finds instead an emptiness, a \\"loss in a glorious past\\", and finally a shadow of him/herself. In a series of social encounters in locations around Phnom Penh, Ali's bug impassively occupies central stage among communities, schools, cinemas, restaurants, bars, and urban and rural landscapes undergoing rapid change and development, in order to challenge religious intolerance, difference in others, and a globalizing world. Ali has worked with filmmakers to create \\"1700% Project: Mistaken for Muslim\\" to address an increase in violence toward the Muslim community after the 9/11 terrorist attack. =Awards= In 2015, Anida Yoeu Ali won the Sovereign Asian Prize in Hong Kong. The Sovereign Asian Art Prize was launched in 2004 and aims at encouraging Asian promising artists while acting as a fundraiser for charities. Her winning piece is called Spiral Alley - a photographic print from The Buddhist Bug. Ali was also the $20,000 grand prize recipient in the Millennium Park music festival's online video contest, with her work titled, \\"1700% Project: Mistaken for Muslim\\". Worked on with her husband, a Japanese video producer named Masahiro Sugana, the video depicts a poet, dancer, angel, and prisoner speaking out against anti-Muslim hate crimes. This is also reinforced with images of hate crimes taking place, to show the disturbing nature of such discourse.

This malware uses keystroke logging and form grabbing to steal user credentials for malicious use. SpyEye allows hackers to steal money from online bank accounts and initiate transactions even while valid users are logged into their bank account. SpyEye has the ability to insert new fields and alter existing fields when a compromised user's browser displays a web page, allowing it to prompt for user names, passwords, or card numbers, thereby giving hackers information that allows them to steal money without account holders ever noticing. It can save the user's false balance (with fraudulent transactions hidden) so that the next time the user logs in, the fraudulent transactions and real balance are not displayed in the user's browser (though the bank still sees the fraudulent transactions.) SpyEye emanated from Russia in 2009 and was sold in underground forums for $500+ in which SpyEye advertised features such as keyloggers, auto-fill credit card modules, email backups, config files (encrypted), Zeus killer, HTTP access, POP3 grabbers and FTP grabbers. Target users and institutions in the United States, United Kingdom, Mexico, Canada and India were the largest victims of SpyEye; the United States made up 97% of the institutions that fell victim of this malware.

The area was originally the territory of the Ngadjuri people. The cadastral Hundred of Apoinga was proclaimed on 7 August 1851 by Governor Henry Young. It is believed to be a corruption of \\"appinga\\", a name of a local Aboriginal tribe. The hundred had its own local government, the District Council of Apoinga, from 1873 to 1932; however, the council seat was at Logan Gap. The Apoinga Lutheran Church opened on 10 July 1936 in the former Apoinga School, but the congregation relocated to the Black Springs Church (a former Anglican church) in 1963. The modern locality was established in August 2000, when boundaries were formalised for the \\"long established local name\\". A portion of Apoinga was severed and added to Emu Downs on 20 August 2015 to resolve an access problem. The locality is much smaller than the cadastral hundred, consisting of a north-south strip along part of the hundred's western border. The historic former Apoinga Hotel and the Apoinga Smelter Site (the former Penny's Smelting Works) on Tothill Belt Road are listed on the South Australian Heritage Register. The smelter was established at Apoinga in 1848 by Messrs Penny and Owen. Until then, ore from the copper mines at Burra was transported to Port Adelaide and shipped to Swansea in Wales for smelting. Establishing smelters in Australia could reduce the cost of producing copper ingots. There was no supply of coal known in South Australia to fuel a smelter. Penny believed he had a process of smelting ore using a smelter fueled by charcoal made from the abundant timber supplies in the area. Apoinga was on the road from Burra to Adelaide. The smelter produced its first copper in January 1849, but had closed by 1852 as the miners moved to the Victorian gold rush.

In 1999, he created E4M, a free and open-source disk encryption software program for Microsoft Windows, and is sometimes credited for open- source TrueCrypt, which is based on E4M's code, though he denies involvement with TrueCrypt. He was arrested on 26 September 2012 for conspiracy to import narcotics into the United States, and agreed to cooperate with authorities in exchange for a lesser sentence and immunity to any crimes he might admit to afterwards. He subsequently admitted to arranging or participating in seven murders, carried out as part of an extensive illegal business empire. Le Roux was sentenced to 25 years in prison in June 2020. Early life Le Roux was born on December 24, 1972, at Lady Rodwell Maternity Home in Bulawayo and given up for adoption. His birth certificate gives his first name as \\"unknown\\" and makes no mention of his father. His biological mother's identity has not been disclosed; one source claims she was a poor teenager, while another states that his maternal grandmother was married to a US senator. Aged two months, he was adopted by a couple living in the asbestos-mining town of Mashava and given his future name, Paul Calder Le Roux. His parents never told him about his adoption, although various family members would learn of it over the years, and Le Roux himself would only find out in 2002. He had a younger sister and was well-loved by his adoptive parents and the extended family. Following the political events of 1980, with Robert Mugabe assuming power and ending white minority rule, the family relocated to South Africa in 1984 for better schooling opportunities for Paul. They found a new home in the mining town of Krugersdorp, where Le Roux's father started a company managing coal- mining operations, soon bringing wealth to the family. Shortly after, Le Roux was given his first computer in exchange for washing his father's car. As a teenager, he was described as tall, trim and handsome, though not very social and not interested in sport. However, he was obsessed with the video game Wing Commander, which he would play on his gaming console connected to the family TV. Aged 15 or 16, Le Roux was arrested for selling pornography after police searched the family home. The family managed to keep the incident private. Following his arrest, Le Roux became even more reclusive. An excellent student, he would refuse to learn Afrikaans, mandatory in South African schools, calling it a \\"dead language\\" and eventually dropping out of school, aged 16. He enrolled in a local programming course, in which he excelled, completing the one-year course in eight weeks. Upon returning from a family holiday trip to the US, 17-year-old Le Roux decided to leave South Africa, and departed to the UK eight months later. He found work as a programmer, and, in 1994, met his future wife, Michelle. After six months in the US, he followed Michelle to Australia in 1995. The couple married and Le Roux acquired Australian citizenship. They lived in Perth and Sydney. It is unclear whether the couple had any children ‚Äì some sources mention a son, while others claim Le Roux's first child (a son) was with his second wife. Le Roux has revealed little about his early life, and most of it was uncovered by journalist Evan Ratliff, relying mainly on an initially unnamed source close to Le Roux. He would later name Le Roux‚Äôs cousin and former employee Mathew Smith as a source. Internet activity and encryption software Various Usenet newsgroup postings made by Le Roux are known from the second half of the 1990s. Some of them are highly technical encryption discussions, while others can be summarized as trolling. Le Roux would frequently post angry, sarcastic and offensive messages, including harsh verbal attacks against Australia as well as racist comments. On various occasions, he would later express his amusement at the reactions of other users. In 1995, Le Roux appears as the owner of a business, World Away Pty. Around 1997‚Äì1998, Le Roux began to develop E4M (Encryption for the Masses), which was first released on December 18, 1998. The product is capable of encrypting entire disks, and optionally of plausible deniability (denying the existence of an encrypted volume). Le Roux claimed the software had been written \\"from scratch\\". The software was released free of charge and with source code. In the \\"Politics\\" section of the E4M website, Le Roux published a kind of manifesto stating that governments are increasingly relying on electronic data gathering. Citing projects such as Echelon, linked to the five nation states which would become known as the \\"Five Eyes\\" more than a decade later, he stated that encryption is the only way to preserve civil liberties. With no income from his previous two years of labour, Le Roux was struggling financially. He was divorced from his first wife in Brisbane in 1999. Sources close to Le Roux describe the divorce as \\"violent\\", while another states the couple parted ways amicably. Le Roux relocated to Hong Kong, then to Rotterdam, where he married a Dutch citizen named Lilian Cheung Yuen Pui. The couple had a son soon after. To monetize E4M, he launched SW Professionals in 2000. Based in South Africa, the company offered offshore programming, including E4M customization. According to its website, it had 5 to 6 employees. Le Roux himself was reportedly rarely seen in South Africa, and was still in a precarious financial situation. In 2001 Le Roux was approached by Wilfried Hafner, a client with whom he had corresponded for several years about E4M. Hafner offered him a position in his newly founded company SecurStar. Le Roux was to build the engine for its upcoming DriveCrypt product, based on E4M and another product, Scramdisk (whose inventor, Shaun Hollingworth, had also joined SecurStar, where he still worked as of mid-2019http://www.securstar.biz/about-us.html). Both Hafner and Hollingworth describe him as a gifted programmer who would contribute innovative ideas. He was dismissed in 2002 upon Hafner discovering that Le Roux continued to work on E4M, incorporating some of the work he had done for SecurStar. Nonetheless, Hafner and Le Roux reconciled personally and stayed in touch for some time. Around the same time, Le Roux was working on a gaming engine for an online casino he intended to launch in Canada and Romania. Hafner would later describe Le Roux as \\"not a marketer\\" and that he \\"didn't see how he could bring in the gamers to play.\\" In 2001, Le Roux appears listed as a director of a company named SSD Software. SW Professionals went out of business in October 2002 and Le Roux solicited contract work with a Usenet post. =TrueCrypt release and controversy= In February 2004 the first version of TrueCrypt was released by anonymous developers who called themselves \\"the TrueCrypt Team\\", built on E4M code. As its developers remained anonymous, some of Le Roux's former SecurStar colleagues, including Hafner, suspected Le Roux of being involved but could not find any corroborating evidence. The actual authors remain unknown as of 2017. According to Matthew Green, a computer science professor at the Johns Hopkins Information Security Institute and leader of the TrueCrypt audit in 2014, TrueCrypt \\"was written by anonymous folks; it could have been Paul Le Roux writing under an assumed name, or it could have been someone completely different.\\" Hafner sent a cease-and-desist letter to an email address associated with the TrueCrypt developers. The TrueCrypt Team immediately stopped development and distribution of TrueCrypt, which they announced on Usenet. Team member David Tesa≈ô√≠k stated that Le Roux informed the team that there was a legal dispute between himself and SecurStar, and that he had received legal advice not to comment on the case. Because of this, he was unable to confirm or deny the legitimacy of TrueCrypt, keeping its development in limbo. A new version was released in June, but with a different digital signature and the developers now being referred to as \\"the TrueCrypt Foundation\\". The project received funding, the source of which is equally unclear. Responding to the TrueCrypt controversy, Le Roux sent his last Usenet post, in which he wrote \\"the pure speculation here (often stated as fact) is damaging and in some cases libelous.\\" This appears to be the last online appearance he made using his real name. Le Roux's involvement with TrueCrypt still remains unclear as of 2016. Le Roux himself has denied developing TrueCrypt in a court hearing in March 2016, in which he also confirmed he had written E4M. On the other hand, he reportedly ordered employees around 2007 to encrypt their hard disks with E4M and later with TrueCrypt. RX Limited In 2003, Le Roux sent out a request to various Usenet groups, in which he solicited business contacts in the US: Around 2004, at the advice of a lawyer in Costa Rica, Le Roux abandoned his online gambling activities and launched several web sites and call centers for the online sale of prescription drugs. To place an order on these sites, customers would fill out questionnaires about their medical history and symptoms, order their chosen medication and pay by credit card. The questionnaires would get forwarded to doctors in the US, who would in turn write prescriptions for the drugs ordered, despite never having examined the patient in person. The prescription, along with the customer's order, would go to a pharmacy in the US, which would then ship the drug. Both the doctor and the pharmacy would receive a commission for the order. Prosecution in the case alleged in 2014 that \\"some of [RX Limited's] customers' hands are cold and 6 feet under right now.\\" RX Limited advertised its services through spam email. As messages pointing to one particular web site would quickly get blocked by spam filters, RX Limited would open up new sites. Initially the new domains were purchased individually from domain sellers such as GoDaddy, until RX Limited set up its own domain seller, ABSystems, allowing RX Limited to spawn new domains on a much larger scale. By 2012, LegitScript estimated that more than half the rogue online pharmacies in the world were registered through ABSystems. The business operated in a legal gray area, but many employees and pharmacists had the impression that it was acting legally. Each order came with a prescription, and the system would keep track of customers' orders and block unusually large orders arriving within a short period of time. The system also seemed to adapt to apparent changes in regulation. Pharmacists were shown the licenses of the doctors writing the prescriptions and recruiters would stress the fact that the business was not selling controlled substances. In at least one instance, a pharmacist was given the contact details of a former DEA agent, who confirmed there would be no legal issues in shipping any of the medications offered by RX Limited. The business was highly profitable. The US Internal Revenue Service calculated that RX Limited owed more than $1.5m in tax from 2005 alone. The debt is still outstanding. =Medications= Medications offered through RX Limited's web sites included: * Fioricet (active ingredients: butalbital, acetaminophen and caffeine), a treatment for tension headaches and migraine * Propecia (active ingredient: finasteride), a treatment for hair loss * Soma (active ingredient: carisoprodol), a muscle relaxant to treat back problems * Ultram (active ingredient: tramadol), a synthetic opioid painkiller * Viagra (active ingredient: sildenafil), a treatment for erectile dysfunction =Call centres= Call centres were initially set up in Israel, checking orders and handling customer complaints. Employees in these call centres were told to adopt American-sounding names in customer contacts and tell customers they were located in Utah. One such operation was Beit Oridan (later renamed to IBS Systems and finally to SCSM). The Jerusalem-based business was registered in 2005 by two Israeli brothers, with Le Roux acting as a silent partner. One of the brothers left the company in July 2006, the other in the fall of 2007, with no official explanation, and Le Roux oversaw the operation directly, with the two Israeli managers now reporting directly to him. In the autumn of 2008, the two managers of the Jerusalem call centre were tasked with overseeing the opening of a new call center in Tel Aviv. The new call centre opened in 2009 under the name CSWW (Customer Service World-Wide) and took over customer service, while Jerusalem-based SCSM would handle accounting and company infrastructure. As RX Limited continued to grow, Le Roux began opening call centres in the Philippines, staffing manager positions with Israelis recruited by the SCSM managers. Le Roux paid Israeli-level salaries despite the cost of living being much lower in Manila, making his job offers seem an attractive opportunity. He provided the Israeli expats with apartments in various neighbourhoods of Manila but would frequently relocate them, stating he needed their apartment. By 2010, he had at least ten call centers with more than 1,000 employees. In 2011 the US government restricted the distribution of Soma, banning its distribution across state borders and requiring pharmacies to obtain special DEA approval to dispense it. As Soma was among RX Limited's best-selling drugs, the company lost around one third of its business and was forced to downsize. Le Roux decided to close the Tel Aviv call center and downsize the Jerusalem office. He began smuggling pharmaceuticals from Mexico into the US to fulfill orders. =Mock execution of a call centre manager= Realizing the rapid expansion of RX Limited and its constant search of new pharmacies in late 2008, two managers of the Israeli call centre started casually discussing the possibility of opening their own pharmacy in the US. They believed they could open a flourishing business while at the same time helping Le Roux's operations. A few months after this casual conversation, one of the two managers was dispatched to the Philippines for what he believed to be a business meeting with three partners he did not know, one of whom was Dave Smith. He was thrown off a yacht and shot at while Smith accused him of stealing from Le Roux. Upon learning that he had merely discussed plans which would have been beneficial for both sides, Smith pulled him back on board. Le Roux later warned him that he would be killed if he were even suspected of stealing, and made similar threats if he were to leave. Farmland leases in Zimbabwe Between September 2007 and 2008, Le Roux spent $12 m to secure 99-year leases on farmland the Zimbabwean government had seized from white farmers, and to lobby Mugabe with the help of Ari Ben-Menashe, lobbyist and former Israeli intelligence officer. His plan was to bring back white farmers to the land. It is alleged that he \\"wanted to see Zimbabwe back under the control of the whites\\". In his only known media statement, Le Roux told the Washington newspaper The Hill: \\"We want recognition that injustice was done in the past and that the land-reform program corrects that.\\" Rumors existed that the farmland leases were only part of a bigger plan going as far as removing Mugabe from power. Le Roux eventually abandoned his plans around 2008. Logging In 2007, Le Roux also took up logging operations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Also around 2007‚Äì2008, Le Roux hired Ben-Menashe to lobby the government of Vanuatu to allow the logging of kauri trees. The deal was arranged, but Le Roux disappeared. Between late 2008 and early 2009 Le Roux withdrew from all of his logging operations. Expansion into illegal business In 2007, Le Roux relocated his family to Manila, into a house in the upscale gated community of Dasmari√±as, and oversaw his business from there. Realizing the commercial success of his online pharmacy business, a legal gray area at the time, Le Roux decided to diversify and expand into illegal activities around 2007. These included logging, precious metals mining, gold smuggling, land deals, drug shipments, arms trafficking and money laundering. He operated in a number of places, including Manila, Hong Kong, Colombia, Africa and Brazil. Numerous Israelis were recruited through RX Limited during that time, invited to the Philippines and assigned to operations outside RX Limited. These included a logging business in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, procuring gold directly from African mines or guarding houses owned by Le Roux in Hong Kong. Many of Le Roux's organizations were staffed with former soldiers. Hong Kong was the financial hub of Le Roux's organization. Proceeds from Le Roux's various operations would be invested in gold bars, diamonds and silver grain and stored in Hong Kong in one of several houses and apartments which Le Roux owned for that purpose. A number of Israelis, many of them former elite soldiers, had been recruited to guard them. Ultimately, the goods would be transferred to Le Roux's base in Manila by boat or private plane. Payments to RX Limited's call centers and suppliers would be wired from Hong Kong. Several of the shell companies registered by or on behalf of Le Roux were based in Hong Kong. Le Roux kept his operations highly compartmentalized. Few people in his organization were aware of the full extent of its activities. In one instance, when Le Roux was already acting as an informant, he dispatched one team to Mauritius for a series of meetings, while another was to provide surveillance. Neither team knew of the other, and it was not until the surveillance team returned from its mission that its head, Hunter, recognized the members of the other team in the surveillance photos. Beginning in or before 2008, Le Roux started covering his tracks. He operated through several shell companies in various countries and used multiple false identities, some backed with false papers. Among these were a legitimate Congolese diplomatic passport, issued in August 2008 (with his name listed as Solotshi Calder Le Roux, Paul, and his birth date as 1982-12-24), and a Zimbabwean passport, issued in 2009, under the name Bernard John Bowlins, born 1964-06-20. In a 2008 online chat transcript he discussed staging his own death and disappearing into a new identity, and getting a birth certificate under a new name. Around the same time, he is first reported to have used violence to intimidate opponents: in 2008, he ordered the house of his cousin and employee Mathew Smith firebombed over a financial dispute. Around 2011 Le Roux began to disappear for long periods of time, with none of his employees knowing his whereabouts. As US authorities were closing in on him, Le Roux took up temporary residence in Rio de Janeiro and planned his move there. Accounts on the timeframe vary: depending on the source, he first arrived in Rio sometime between 2010 (two years before his arrival in May 2012) and November 2011. Le Roux had a Brazilian lover in Rio, with whom he had a son, thus being protected from extradition under Brazilian law. Le Roux arrived in Rio de Janeiro on 19 May 2012, with Cayanan and their daughter, posing as tourists. Three Israeli associates would oversee his operations during his absence. =Notable figures= Dave Smith Smith was a British native and allegedly carried an American passport. He had done security work in Iraq and then for a risk- management company in the Philippines. Le Roux hired Smith in or before 2008, making him his de facto deputy and head of security. Smith gave Le Roux access to a network of former security contractors who had previously served in Iraq or Afghanistan. Hit man Ronald Baricuatro, apprehended in February 2012 and connected to the assassination of Mike Lontoc in September 2011, stated he was hired by Smith to conduct surveillance on journalist Mar T. Supnad in preparation of a planned hit. Both hits were in connection with the seizure of the Captain Ufuk in 2009. In 2011, Le Roux began suspecting Smith of skimming off drugs and gold from shipments, and had him assassinated. According to one source, Smith was kidnapped outside a bar while drunk, and placed in a shallow grave. Then he was shot and buried. Another source claims that Smith was thrown off a boat and shot in a manner similar to the Israeli call center manager. Le Roux himself supposedly fired at least some of the shots. In a court hearing in March 2016, Le Roux admitted his involvement. The judge did not allow questions on how Smith was murdered. Joseph Hunter Joseph Hunter, who would later become Le Roux's top hit man, was hired between 2007 and 2009. Raised in Owensboro, Kentucky, Hunter had enlisted in the army in 1983 and joined the Rangers in 1985. Eight months later, in 1986, Hunter was discharged for medical reasons, after the death of a friend in his unit during a training exercise left him traumatized. He spent the rest of his military career as a drill sergeant and sniper instructor. Over the course of 18 years he was posted in Germany, Panama and Puerto Rico. He was dismissed in mid-2004, holding the rank of sergeant first class. He received multiple honors for his service in the Army. After retiring from the Army, Hunter returned to Owensboro. He planned to join the police, but never did. Sources are inconclusive about the reasons: Hunter either passed the New York City Police exam but decided the city was too expensive, or he was rejected due to his age, despite being in excellent physical condition. In 2005 Hunter became an inmate counselor at the Green River Correctional Complex. Dissatisfied with his job, he quit it after 15 months in 2006, and subsequently signed up with a private security firm. He was dispatched to Iraq, taking fingerprints and DNA swabs from company employees. Two years later he joined another firm, protecting US embassy staff and investigating suicide bombings. According to his family, Hunter had become increasingly short-tempered during his time in the army. Hunter himself stated that his time in Iraq exacerbated these traits. He became moody, irritable and aggressive. Later, while in custody following his arrest in 2013, he was diagnosed with PTSD. Between 2007 and 2009, Hunter was introduced to Le Roux by a colleague. He was initially tasked with buying and selling gold in Mali. Le Roux offered Hunter a job as his bodyguard in 2009. According to Hunter's own accounts, he began to realize in mid-2009 that he was involved in illegal operations and, due to his name being used in various operations, suspected he was being set up to be \\"sacrificed\\" to law enforcement, but claimed to fear for his life if he were to quit. In 2010 Dave Smith dismissed Hunter, considering him \\"too hot headed\\". Hunter lived in the US for a year and returned following Smith's assassination in 2011, taking Smith's former position. His exit from and return to the organization would later prompt the court to reject his duress defense. Hunter carried out or oversaw multiple murders for Le Roux, which the organization referred to as \\"bonus jobs\\". He apparently recruited hit men through contacts from his days as a defense contractor. Many of the hit men Hunter recruited for Le Roux were, like him, former soldiers who had had trouble settling into civilian life. =Iran arms deal= A 2014 court document revealed that Le Roux was also charged with exporting \\"goods, technology and services\\" to the Iranian government between 2009 and 2012. The goods are believed to be a missile guidance system. =Somali arms and drug deals= Through his company Southern Ace, Le Roux supplied AK-47 assault rifles and light machine guns to Somali militias starting in April 2009, in violation of an existing arms embargo. Rumors exist that Le Roux was planning to build a militia to invade the Seychelles. His enforcer Hunter is known to have bragged about such plans, but the head of the UN investigative team concerned with Le Roux's activities in Somalia dismissed it. According to him, Le Roux intended to set up a security firm specialized in protecting commercial ships from pirate attacks. In March 2010, Le Roux had plans to import a large quantity of heavy weapons to Somalia by air, though the delivery never took place. In mid-2010 Le Roux discovered he was paying militiamen almost twice the market rate, and a dispute with his partner in the operation, known only by his alias \\"Ottavio\\", erupted. Following the dispute with \\"Ottavio\\", most of Southern Ace's international staff left Somalia by early 2011, with only two remaining. \\"Ottavio\\" took over local operations, the two foreigners appear to have handled administrative tasks. One of them, a Zimbabwean national named Jirat Taeko, is reported to have been killed in January 2011 following an argument over financial issues. Altogether, Le Roux's organisation spent an estimated $3m on the operation, including almost $1m in militia salaries and over $150,000 worth in arms and ammunition. \\"Ottavio\\" was alleged by the UN to also be involved in experiments to cultivate narcotic plants including opium, coca and cannabis near the Ethiopian border. The involvement of Philippine, Zimbabwean and South African nationals in the operation was implied. Some sources claim Le Roux had plans to start a cocaine plantation in Somalia. =The Captain Ufuk= According to his own accounts, Bruce Jones was hired by Dave Smith in 2008 to purchase a ship in Turkey and sail it from there to the Philippines via Indonesia, with Manila-based company La Plata Trading (one of Le Roux's companies) paying expenses and supplying the crew. Jones completed the purchase of the Captain Ufuk and sailed to Jakarta, Indonesia. There he picked up a shipment of guns from a company called PT Pindad, bound for Manila-based Red White and Blue Arms Inc., and continued his journey to the Philippines. Jones had been supplied with an end-user certificate, according to which the guns were meant for Mali's Ministry of Internal Security and Civil Protection, and the pickup was guarded by Indonesian police and soldiers, thus Jones later claimed he believed the shipment to be legitimate. Journalist Evan Ratliff, citing a leaked document, claims the Indonesian Ministry of Defense had approved the sale. In reality, however, the guns were intended to be delivered to La Plata Trading and subsequently sold to rebels in the south of the country, including Islamist terrorist group Abu Sayyaf. Seizure As Jones approached his final destination, he was ordered by his employers to delay bringing the ship into port. The ship remained anchored for several days near the coast of Mariveles, Bataan, three hours west of Manila. On 19 August 2008, Jones told his boss he wanted to get on land, as his wife was pregnant and due to deliver. His employers sent out a yacht, the Mou Man Tai, with Smith, replacement captain Lawrence Burne and a rubber speedboat on board. 16 boxes of guns were transferred to the yacht, accompanied by Hunter, who had been on board the Captain Ufuk. Jones returned to Subic Bay in the smaller boat. During the day, a local fisherman had become suspicious of the ship and alerted authorities. The next day Philippine Coast Guard and customs officials motored out to the Captain Ufuk and discovered 20 unmarked wooden crates, for which the captain was unable to produce a cargo manifest. Officials discovered the guns in the crates, among them Pindad SS1 assault rifles. Replacement captain Burne was arrested but jumped bail. Later, in December 2014, he was sentenced in absentia to eight years of imprisonment for tax evasion related to the shipment. He remains at large as of early 2016. The crew, all of them Georgian citizens, were detained and indicted in 2010. They were eventually deported to Georgia. Assassination of Bruce Jones The press implicated Jones in its coverage of the case. Jones went into hiding and in early September surrendered to the authorities. He agreed to cooperate, on the condition of being placed on a witness protection program. He received numerous death threats and observed individuals apparently surveying him. He was never given the witness protection his lawyer requested. One year after the incident, he started to become confident that his former employers were no longer after him. On 21 September 2010, he and his wife and son met a friend, known to him as John Nash, and his wife for lunch in a mall in Angeles, north of Manila. On his way back from the mall, Jones was shot fatally by two assassins on a motorcycle. His wife was struck by one bullet but survived. The assassination took place next to a shooting range, which provided ideal cover. Le Roux has never been formally accused in connection with Jones's death, although he allegedly admitted to ordering the hit in a private conversation. The case was archived between 2012 and 2013, and remains unsolved as of October 2015, with no suspect ever arrested over it. Raid of Herbert Tan Tiu's home In early October 2010 the Philippine National Police searched the home of Herbert Tan Tiu and discovered several Indonesian-made assault rifles, suspected to come from the Captain Ufuk. Tan Tiu disappeared later and is still missing. Assassination of Michael Lontoc Lontoc, general manager of Red White and Blue Arms Inc., was on his way back from a shooting competition in a Manila suburb in September 2011. As he slowed down at a busy intersection, he received a mobile phone call. At the same time, four men surrounded his car and fired into it. Lontoc died on the scene. His widow later told reporters he had become involved with an arms smuggling cartel and tried to get out. A year after the assassination of Lontoc, a man named Jimmy Pianiar confessed to killing him. He stated he and three other men had been paid to carry out the murder and made at least five attempts to carry it out. The identity of the person behind the killings was not disclosed, he was referred to only as the \\"mastermind\\". Arrest of Ronald Baricuatro Baricuatro was arrested in the Manila neighborhood of Dasmari√±as while trying to redeem a motorcycle previously confiscated from an alleged financier of a gun smuggling syndicate, British national Cristopher Leruef. Found in his possessions were a wig, camera, various false ID cards and a \\"hit list\\". Mar Supnad, an investigative journalist who had reported on the Captain Ufuk case, was at the top of the list. Being wanted for previous charges of arson and a murder he committed over a family dispute, he was detained. Witnesses later claimed to have seen Baricuatro conducting surveillance on Lontoc's car hours prior to his assassination. Baricuatro later stated that he was hired by Dave Smith to conduct surveillance on Supnad but somebody else would have carried out the actual killing. Disappearance of Joe Zu√±iga Lawyer Joe Frank Zu√±iga had represented Jones in the Captain Ufuk case. On 20 June 2012, he left his home to meet with a client. He was last seen at 11:45 in the Subic Bay area in the company of Timothy Desmond, CEO of the Ocean Adventure water park, and John Nash, its head of security. Around the same time, a witness reported a man being dragged into a van near Zu√±iga's car. A call between Zu√±iga's cell phone and a family member appears to have taken place at 2 pm. His car was discovered on the afternoon of the following day. Zu√±iga has since been missing and police presume him dead. The case was archived between 2012 and 2014, without any suspects ever being arrested over it. John Nash Nash ran a security firm in the Subic Bay area. A close friend of both Bruce Jones and Joe Zu√±iga, he was the last to see both men alive. As the National Bureau of Investigation started investigating him in connection with Zu√±iga's case, they discovered he was using the identity of a deceased person and arrested him on 2 May 2014. He refused to disclose his identity and, despite inquiries to the US, UK, Australia and South Africa, no state can give any clue to his citizenship or identity, nor can any of his acquaintances. He remains in custody in the Philippines as of November 2015, thus far only accused of an immigration violation. His identity, citizenship, possible connection to Le Roux or role in the cases of Jones and Zu√±iga, remain unclear. Aftermath All open cases related to the Captain Ufuk were archived between 2012 and 2014. Paul Le Roux has never been formally accused in any of them. Journalist Evan Ratliff, citing sources in law enforcement and Le Roux's organization, implies that he avoided charges through bribery and intimidation. =The JeReVe= Following his relocation to Rio de Janeiro, Le Roux started planning two drug shipments from Ecuador via yacht. One of the two yachts to be used for the shipment, the JeReVe (from French je r√™ve \\"I dream\\"), arrived in Ecuador in August 2012. The JeReVe would travel to Australia, the other yacht to the Philippines, each carrying approximately 200 kg of cocaine. DEA agents managed to place a tracking device on the JeReVe and follow her movements. She briefly anchored off the coast of Peru, then began her crossing. The tracking device failed 6,000 miles into the journey. Its last reported position dated to late September, near the Cook Islands. The boat headed for the Philippines completed its journey but the JeReVe failed to arrive at her destination. On 7 November, she was found washed up on a reef off the shore of Luatafito Island, an uninhabited atoll in the northern part of Tonga, ten miles north of the main island. The yacht had apparently run into a storm off the coast and capsized. A corpse, believed to be second mate Milan Rindz√°k (35), a Slovak citizen, was found inside. Several passports, money in various European and American currencies and several hundred packets of cocaine, the latter having a street value of $120 million, were also found. There was no trace of the captain of the boat. An autopsy failed to establish the cause of death, which had occurred several days, possibly weeks, earlier. Tongan police tried to locate relatives of Rindz√°k in Slovakia, but Rindz√°k's parents claimed that the body was not their son's. Slovak media speculated that the body could be Maro≈° De√°k, but this remains unconfirmed. Slovak police refused to comment on the speculations, citing ongoing investigations. The body remained unclaimed and was eventually buried in January 2013 at a local cemetery. =Assassination of Noimie Edillor= Part-time real estate broker Noimie Edillor was married to a Filipino customs officer (because of this, some sources incorrectly refer to her as a customs agent) and allegedly worked for La Plata Trading. She allegedly accepted a bribe to help smuggle goods through customs, but did not keep her part of the deal. Hunter hired assassins who put her under surveillance at home, thus discovering she worked as a real estate agent. They posed as potential customers looking for rental property, selecting the one where they believed the murder would be easiest to carry out. They then asked to see that property again and shot her at the door on 23 June 2011. Her husband and sister refused to cooperate with authorities or answer questions from journalists. Following his arrest, Le Roux admitted to ordering the murder in court, but, due to a proffer agreement he has signed following his arrest, he cannot be prosecuted in the US. However, the Philippines‚Äô National Bureau of Investigation have announced that they will seek Le Roux‚Äôs extradition and charge him with the crimes he committed under their jurisdiction. =Assassination of Catherine Lee= Around 2011, Le Roux enlisted real estate broker Catherine Lee from Las Pi√±as City, Philippines, to purchase vacation property in Batangas for him and paid her an advance of $50 million Philippine pesos (the equivalent of US$3 million). Lee enlisted an unnamed associate to fix the deal; however, that associate disappeared with the money. In early February 2012 Lee received an email from two men, who had been hired by Hunter. They introduced themselves as Bill Maxwell and Tony, claiming to be Canadians living in Manila and seeking to invest in real estate. She met the two men and, over the course of three days, showed them various properties. She was last seen alive at 4:30 pm of February 12, their third day, by the owners of a property they had visited and three other brokers. She departed in a car with her clients. Her body was found at 6:30 am the next day in a field in Taytay, Rizal, an industrial city an hour east of Manila. She had been shot four times, a gunshot wound under each eye, which the National Bureau of Investigation suspected to be a signature killing. Dissatisfied with the way the killing was carried out, Hunter dismissed the two hit men. The NBI drew parallels to the case of Noimie Edillor, who was killed in a similar way, unsolved as her family had refused to cooperate with the authorities. The NBI believes the associate was also assassinated, although no body was ever found. Following their arrests in 2012 and 2013, neither Le Roux nor Hunter have been formally accused of the case, despite Le Roux having admitted to ordering the murder in court. (Le Roux signed a proffer agreement, which would give him immunity against prosecution in the US but leaves open the possibility of him being extradited to the Philippines and facing charges there). Hunter and the two hit men were eventually charged and sentenced to life in prison in 2019. Investigation, arrest and prosecution US authorities began investigations against RX Limited in September 2007. In 2009, US authorities came across Le Roux's name and a phone number believed to be his, and started monitoring it. Following the seizure of the Captain Ufuk, the DEA immediately suspected Le Roux's involvement in the case, as the websites of the two companies involved (La Plata Trading and Red White and Blue Arms) were registered through ABSystems, the domain registrar Le Roux set up for RX Limited. US authorities also became suspicious because of numerous calls to Somalia made from the phone number they had previously linked to Le Roux, but his activities were only revealed in a 2011 UN report. In March 2012 the DEA searched a pharmacy in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. Its owner had signed up in the summer of 2006 after a recruiter had assured him about the legitimacy of the business, and over the years had evolved into the main supplier for RX Limited. The owner immediately admitted his involvement and agreed to cooperate with the authorities. He maintained his contacts with the company to help the DEA identify key figures in the operation. US and Brazilian authorities managed to survey Le Roux in Brazil starting in early 2012. Among others, they recorded phone calls between him and his wife Lilian Cheung Yuen Pui. In these, he warned her not to invest into real estate in the Netherlands, as it would be too easy to seize if he were arrested, pointing out that his business was illegal. =Arrests in Hong Kong= Through the wiretaps set up in Rio, DEA agents learned about a large shipment of fertilizer passing through Hong Kong. They informed authorities in Hong Kong, who searched the warehouse, finding 24 tons of ammonium nitrate fertilizer, enough to create an explosive ten times the size of the one used in the Oklahoma City bombing. The office of a Le Roux-owned company in Hong Kong and the apartment of its manager were searched on April 30, providing clues to further parts of the organization. Several employees of Le Roux's, most of them Israelis, were arrested over the following days as they tried to liquidate his assets, mostly gold bars, and attempted to move money out of the country. Among those arrested was Maro≈° De√°k, operating under the name Ivan Vaclavik, wanted in the EU in connection with the murder of his brother Roman in 1999. He later jumped bail and escaped to Rio de Janeiro. A Filipino citizen was also arrested and jumped bail later. Le Roux's wife, Lilian Cheung Yuen Pui, was arrested upon entering Hong Kong on May 10 but appears to have been released without charges. The fertilizer was later revealed to be of a quality unsuitable for explosives, indicating Le Roux's partner in the deal betrayed him. No one has ever been charged in relation to the explosives. The Israelis were later sentenced in Hong Kong, receiving sentences from four to over five years in prison on charges of possession of ‚Äúproperty known or reasonably believed to represent the proceeds of an indictable offence‚Äù. At least two of them were released early and returned to Israel. =Arrest of Le Roux= Authorities learned through the Rio wiretaps that Le Roux was making arrangements for two drug shipments via yacht from Ecuador. This was when US authorities first learned of Le Roux's involvement with drugs. Previously wanted only for unlawful sale of prescription drugs, he now became a target of the DEA's narco-terrorism investigators. An associate of Le Roux approached him about a representative of a Colombian cartel that wanted to build a methamphetamine operation in Liberia, and flew to Rio de Janeiro for a meeting on 11 May 2012. Le Roux would supply precursor chemicals, a facility and a chemist. In return, he would be offered 100 kg of cocaine for each 100 kg of methamphetamine produced, after letting the Colombians test a sample. Le Roux would meet the cartel representative in Liberia to finalize the deal. Unknown to Le Roux, the Colombian cartel representatives were DEA agents and the operation was an attempt to apprehend him. As he could not be extradited under Brazilian law, being the father of a Brazilian child, the DEA had chosen to lure him into Liberia, which would allow them to bring him to the US without an extradition proceeding. The associate had collaborated with the DEA and been carefully instructed to make Le Roux aware of the fact that the methamphetamine was to be sold in New York, providing the foundation for accusing Le Roux in the US. Le Roux flew to Monrovia, Liberia, on 25 September to meet the representative of the Colombian cartel. The day after his arrival he was arrested by Liberian police. He tried to offer a bribe but the officers rejected it and handed him over to DEA agents, who took him to the US. During the flight back to the US, Le Roux agreed to cooperate with authorities. Upon arrival he was assigned an attorney and placed in secret custody in New York City. He was charged with conspiracy to import narcotics into the US and violation of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The day after his arrival, Le Roux signed a proffer agreement, agreeing to plead guilty to these two charges in exchange for immunity against prosecution for any other crimes he might admit to. Immediately after, he admitted to arranging or participating in seven murders for which he thus could not be prosecuted. Le Roux may thus have evaded an impending death sentence, converting it to a prison sentence of 25 years according to Folha de S√£o Paulo, \\"around 12 years\\" by his own account. Le Roux's arrest, whereabouts and cooperation were kept confidential and all papers related to the case were sealed. Authorities attempted to give the impression that Le Roux was still at large in Brazil. Le Roux modified his own email service, fast-free-email.com, through which all his personal mail passed, to preserve copies of his messages (the system had previously been set up to periodically destroy them). He continued to direct his former associates until at least mid-2014, leading them into stings set up by DEA agents. His cooperation has resulted in the arrest of at least 11 people. Another 7 were arrested by the DEA without his direct involvement. =Sting operation against Le Roux associates= Starting in late 2012, Le Roux ordered his associates Scott Stammers and Allan Kelly Reyes Peralta to provide methamphetamine from Ye Tiong Tan Lim, who had worked with Le Roux before. Peralta and Lim met the fake Colombian cartel representatives in January. The Colombians asked to see the labs, which, according to Lim, were located in North Korea. Lim declined the request as the presence of foreigners would have raised suspicions. Lim provided samples of meth in February, sending it to Philip Shackels, another Le Roux associate. Shackels and Stammers forwarded it to Monrovia, as requested by their clients. The samples tested at 96% and 98%. Around the same time, Hunter was directed by Le Roux to assemble a team of hit men for the fake Colombian cartel. Hunter recruited three military veterans, two Germans (Michael Filter and Dennis G√∂gel) and one Pole (Slawomir Soborski). He arranged a meeting with them and the \\"clients\\" in a house belonging to Le Roux in Phuket. The DEA agents recorded the conversations between all of them. In the recordings, Hunter was heard boasting of having carried out two murders in the Philippines, as well as the mock execution of the call center manager in 2009. He claimed to have assassinated nine people in one year. The team was dispatched to their first task, determining whether Thai police were watching a shipment of drugs from Koh Samui. In April 2014, Stammers and Shackels met with the Colombians and a prospective arms buyer in Mauritius. A second meeting was with Stammers, Shackels, the Colombians and two Serbians from whom they sought to obtain between 700 and 1,000 kg of cocaine to make up for the loss of the JeReVe. Hunter's three new hires provided security. In mid-May, Stammers and Shackels again met with the Colombians about logistics of the methamphetamine shipment. Due to the political situation, Lim claimed, he could not ship any methamphetamine from North Korea but had one ton stockpiled in the Philippines, from where it would be shipped to Thailand and on to Liberia. Adrian Valkovic, sergeant-at-arms for the Outlaw Motorcycle Club in Bangkok, would provide security and logistics in Thailand with eight armed club members. Timothy Vamvakias, already a member of Le Roux's organization, was added to Hunter's team of hit men in May. The team received another task: providing counter-surveillance for a plane in Bahamas due to deliver 200 kg of cocaine to the US. In late May, Le Roux notified Hunter of an alleged informant in the organization and a DEA agent, ordering the assassination of both and offering a total of $800,000 in reward. The hit would be carried out in Liberia. The Colombians insisted that Soborski and Filter be involved in the operation, together with Vamvakias. Hunter met with his hit men and the Colombians in August in Le Roux's house in Phuket. The assassinations in Liberia would be carried out by G√∂gel and Vamvakias. In the meantime, Soborski and Filter would do reconnaissance in preparation for meeting about a weapons deal in Estonia. On September 25, Hunter was apprehended in Le Roux's house in Phuket, extradited to the US and flown to New York. G√∂gel and Vamvakias landed in Liberia later the same day to carry out the supposed hit. They were arrested by Liberian police upon arrival, transferred into DEA custody and flown to New York. Soborski and Filter were arrested in Estonia. Both men were transported to a former Soviet prison. Soborski was severely injured in the operation and would later require abdominal surgery. Both were extradited to New York City on drug charges related to the Bahamas cocaine shipment for which they had provided surveillance. Lim, Peralta, Stammers, Shackels and Valkovic met in Thailand to discuss logistics of the shipment with the Colombians. All five were arrested by officers of the Narcotics Suppression Bureau. They were extradited to New York City on charges of conspiring to import methamphetamine to the United States. Sources disagree on the date of the arrest: one source states that the Stammers group was arrested on November 19 and 20 (Valkovic being apprehended one day earlier than the others), another states that the arrests took place on the same day as the other arrests, September 25, but were not reported to the media for two months. No official connection was made between the arrests of the two groups. Hunter was later connected to the 2012 murder of Catherine Lee, for which he received an additional life sentence in 2019. =Trial of Le Roux= Le Roux pleaded guilty to being involved with RX Limited in January 2014. In December 2014, he pleaded guilty to trafficking methamphetamine into the US, selling technology to Iran, ordering or participating in seven murders, as well as fraud and bribery. In March 2016 it was revealed that US authorities had taken unspecified steps to protect Le Roux's family. On 12 June 2020, Le Roux was sentenced to 25 years in prison. According to the presiding judge, Ronnie Abrams, ‚Äúthe scope and severity of Mr. Le Roux‚Äôs criminal conduct is nothing short of breathtaking. I have before me a man who has engaged in conduct in keeping with the villain in a James Bond movie.‚Äù However, she also added that the sentence reflected Le Roux‚Äôs cooperation and the danger he faced. Upon his release, Le Roux is expected to be deported to the Philippines to stand trial for the murders committed in the Philippines, as well as in relation to an arms shipment intercepted by the government in 2009. =Trial of Hunter and four hit men= The charges against Hunter, G√∂gel and Vamvakias included conspiracy to murder a federal agent and import narcotics. Filter and Soborski were indicted only on drug-related charges. After Hunter's connection with Le Roux became publicly known in December 2014, his defence lawyer argued in January 2015 that Hunter acted out of fear of Le Roux. The court dismissed the motion. Hunter pleaded guilty in late January. All of his co-defendants followed over the course of 2015. Hunter faced between 10 years and life in prison, with federal guidelines recommending between 24 and 30 years. His defence attorney asked for the minimum of 10 years, arguing Hunter is suffering from PTSD resulting from his time in the military and as a security contractor. On 31 May 2016, Hunter was sentenced to 20 years in prison. Co- defendants G√∂gel and Vamvakias also received 20-year sentences. In 2019, Hunter received an additional life sentence for the murder of Catherine Lee. =Trial of RX Limited key figures= In October/November 2013, eleven individuals linked to RX Limited were indicted in Minnesota. These included five RX Limited managers, a pharmacist who had supplied RX Limited and helped it set up its credit card processing in the US, as well as a physician who had issued prescriptions to patients he had never examined in person. Le Roux lured two of the call center managers to Romania in early 2014, in one case under the pretense of arranging for the transfer of money still owed to laid- off employees. Both were arrested by local police and extradited to the US. One of them skipped bail and presumably returned to Israel. The other was acquitted in Minnesota federal court in March 2017. Le Roux made his first public court appearance testifying in the case in March 2016, despite his lawyers arguing that media coverage of the proceedings would put his family in danger and filing several motions to prevent a public hearing. A fake arrest report, dated February 29, 2016, was produced, apparently to conceal the circumstances of his arrest. =Arrest of Catherine Lee's suspected killers= The DEA's investigations into Lee's murder eventually led them to two men in Roxboro, North Carolina. After five witnesses in the Philippines identified them on photographs, testifying to have seen Lee in their company in the days before the murder, Adam Samia and Carl David Stillwell were arrested in their hometown and transferred to New York to be prosecuted with Joseph Hunter. They were reportedly paid $70,000 for the assassination. Both men pleaded not guilty. Court documents revealed in early March 2016 that photos were found on Stillwell's cell phone, dated the day of Lee's murder and \\"appear[ing] to depict, among other things, a white van similar to the one in which (according to witness accounts) Lee was murdered, and a wounded human head.\\" Samia, Stillwell and Hunter received life sentences for the murder of Catherine Lee in 2019. =Media coverage= Le Roux's arrest was initially kept secret. The arrests of his associates were reported in the media but initially not connected to each other or to Le Roux. A first report of Le Roux's arrest surfaced in December 2013 in a Brazilian newspaper, but still did not mention a connection with the other arrests. The article was in Portuguese and did not spread widely. It would take another year, until December 2014, before the New York Times reported about Hunter's arrest, revealing that it was facilitated by Le Roux's cooperation with authorities. Still, Le Roux's case file, and large portions of those of the other defendants, remained sealed. Le Roux was the subject of Gimlet Media's Reply All (podcast) episode #136. In 2019, Evan Ratliff‚Äîwho wrote a series of articles about Le Roux for The Atavist Magazine‚Äîpublished The Mastermind, a 446-page account of Le Roux's ventures. Also in 2019, investigative journalist Elaine Shannon published Hunting Le Roux, a book covering the DEA‚Äôs efforts to capture Le Roux. Identities used Paul Le Roux operated under numerous pseudonyms: * Paul Solotshi Calder Le Roux, backed with a Congolese diplomatic passport * John Bernard Bowlins (or Bernard John Bowlins), confirmed in court statement and backed with a Zimbabwean passport * Johan aka John Paul Leroux (or Leraux) * Johan William Smit, confirmed in court statement  Satoshi Nakamoto candidate  In a WIRED Magazine article, Ratliff opined that it is possible that Le Roux could be Satoshi Nakamoto, following mounting evidence. However, he admitted that, while the possibility could not be ruled out, there wasn't enough direct evidence to substantiate it. In a book written by Evan Ratliff about Paul Le Roux he admitted that a ‚Äúformer employee of Le Roux‚Äôs, now in prison‚Äù suggested Le Roux had been the inventor of bitcoin. The arrest of Le Roux and the last commits by Satoshi to the original Bitcoin repository coincide. Personal life =Adoption= Le Roux's parents never told him about his adoption, despite various family members learning of it over the years. Only in 2002, on a trip to Zimbabwe to retrieve a copy of his birth certificate, did Le Roux's aunt and uncle reveal the truth to him. An unnamed relative recalls this discovery sent Le Roux into a deep personal crisis. Most of all, he is reported to have been upset about \\"the 'unknown' part\\" (which could refer to his first name being listed as \\"unknown\\", the fact that he never knew his biological mother, the fact that his birth certificate does not state who his biological father is, or all of these). =Family= Le Roux met his first wife, an Australian citizen, in London in 1994, and married her in 1995. The couple divorced in Brisbane in 1999. Sources close to Le Roux describe the divorce as \\"violent\\", while another states the couple parted ways amicably. It is unclear whether the couple had any children ‚Äì some sources mention a son while others claim Le Roux's first child (a son) was with his second wife. Between 2000 and 2001, Le Roux married a Dutch citizen named Lilian Cheung Yuen Pui. The couple had a son soon after. She appears to have been involved in his business, managing some of his assets, until Le Roux's arrest. In 2007, he relocated his family to Manila. The couple have a daughter, born around 2007. Despite Le Roux claiming Cayanan as his wife on at least one occasion, his marriage to Pui was never dissolved and he stayed in contact with her until his arrest. A \\"newborn son\\" is also mentioned in 2012, but it is unclear whether the mother is Cayanan or Le Roux's Brazilian mistress. During his stays in Rio de Janeiro, Le Roux began an affair with a local citizen. He fathered a son with her, preventing Brazil from extraditing him. The timeframe of the relationship and birth of the child is unclear. =Character= Reports about Le Roux's personal image vary: while one former associate describes him as \\"not a soft, gentle person\\", another claims he was extraordinarily friendly to newly hired employees, often buying gifts for people. According to him, this way in which Le Roux presented himself made him seem more legitimate, and many of his staff joined his organization believing they were doing legitimate work. The highly compartmentalized nature of Le Roux's operations helped this, as few, if any, employees were aware of the full extent of the activities Le Roux was involved in. As rumors of Le Roux's expansion into organized crime and ordered killings started surfacing in 2009, many employees stayed out of fear he might have them killed or otherwise harm them, should they try to leave. Evan Ratliff attributes Le Roux‚Äôs criminal inclination to his youth in politically-unstable southern Africa in the 1970s and 1980s. While enjoying a comparatively sheltered childhood amid the civil war in Zimbabwe, the chaotic conditions of the time, in which smuggling or operating in legal gray areas were widely considered acceptable, may have influenced his notions of right and wrong, possibly explaining why at least initially Le Roux had no moral concerns about coducting illegal business. Investigative journalist Elaine Shannon believes he was consistently drawn to Africa, which he considered ‚Äúa place where he could do whatever he wanted [‚Ä¶] obey no rules, make his own rules, make his own life, make his own empire.‚Äù Ratliff, while cautious about attributing neo-colonialist tendences to Le Roux, stated that he did repeatedly express such ideas in conversations. A former target on Le Roux‚Äôs hit list describes him as highly inclined to exploit corruption, as ‚Äúhe believes everyody has a price.‚Äù Le Roux became increasingly indifferent to using violence. In one instance he reportedly asked in a casual manner whether somebody who owed him money had any children. On several occasions, he would intimidate people, threatening to have them killed if they were even suspected of betraying him. In 2008, he ordered the house of his cousin and employee Mathew Smith firebombed, following a financial dispute. In the time leading up to his arrest, Le Roux was described as a megalomaniac whose appetite exceeded his caution on one hand, while on the other hand taking care of crucial details, such as fathering a child in Brazil in order to avoid extradition. DEA agents have stated that on the wiretaps, Le Roux gave the impression that \\"he felt like he was not going to get away forever.\\" Le Roux was known for his racist views, which he expressed in Usenet postings and towards his employees. He employed numerous Israelis in key positions, although one former call centre manager states this was mostly because he considered Israelis to be the \\"cheapest, honest, smartest labor that he could find\\" rather than fondness.

Following a ruling by the Congress of Vienna this association came to an end and, on 1 August 1816, the territory of the Amt became part of the newly formed Regierungsbezirk Arnsberg in the Prussian Province of Westphalia.

They are small, yet very direct actions that react to the manner in which urban space is used and the regulations that have been laid down for those who use it. His works often address the lack of freedom that the individual has when it comes to the way public space is allowed to be used and the over-regulation of society. With his interventions he breaches the systems and brings forward another, often humane perspective. With this he tries to let people look at themselves in a different way, often with a sense of humor. Work =Early work= From 1984 till 1986 he worked in abandoned buildings. Entering them without permission and using the walls as his canvas, adding photocopies and paint. He would photograph the resulting combination of his additions and the existing 2D- and 3D elements of the space. From 1987 till 1991 he made interventions in waiting rooms, shops, cafeterias and other semi public spaces. He would ask permission to make an intervention using self-adhesive tape.

The Ted Cruz‚ÄìZodiac Killer meme is a mock-conspiracy theory popularized on the Internet during Ted Cruz's candidacy for President in 2015‚Äì16. The Internet meme facetiously suggests that United States Senator and former 2016 presidential candidate Ted Cruz was the Zodiac Killer, an unidentified Californian serial killer of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Cruz, born in 1970, could not have committed these murders, which began before his birth. Circulators of the meme do not genuinely believe that he was the Zodiac Killer, citing the absurdity of its premise; NPR wrote that the meme captured \\"a feeling they have about Cruz: they think he's creepy. And they want to point that out, as clearly as they can.\\" Origin and spread A January 2016 investigation by Miles Klee of The Daily Dot found the first use of the meme to be by a Twitter user in March 2013, as Cruz was speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference and vowing to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The meme was not repeated until November 2014, by another Twitter user writing about Cruz's proposal against net neutrality. It continued in obscurity up to February 2016, when another Twitter user used Photoshop to edit a picture of a Republican debate in order to include \\"Is Ted Cruz the Zodiac Killer?\\" in the interactive ticker at the bottom. That month, \\"is ted cruz the zodiac killer\\" was the second highest suggestion in Google's autocomplete for \\"is ted\\", but by April it was not in the autocomplete at all. News.com.au writer Matthew Dunn suggested that Google was censoring the search term, showing evidence that it accounted for 89% of total searches when compared to other terms in the autocomplete. In April 2016, the Houston Chronicle said the meme \\"... has a following. A Facebook group named for the meme has more than 27,000 members. A Google search turns up 621,000 hits, including exploratory articles by some of the biggest news publications on the web\\". Cruz himself has jocularly alluded to the meme by tweeting one of the Zodiac Killer's cryptograms; first in October 2017 responding to a retweet from Senator Ben Sasse referring to Cruz as \\"the son of the guy who killed Kennedy\\" (a reference to a conspiracy theory involving Rafael Cruz); and then wishing a \\"Happy Halloween\\" in 2018.; In popular culture Comedian Larry Wilmore made joking suggestions that Cruz was the Zodiac Killer at the White House Correspondents' Dinner in April 2016 After the edited image showing the question on Google trended, the meme spread into popular culture. Books about Cruz being the Zodiac Killer, including romantic ones, were listed on Amazon.com. In February 2016, Public Policy Polling asked registered voters in Florida ahead of the Republican primary if they believed Cruz to be the Zodiac Killer; 10% believed and 28% were not sure. The other 62% did not think he was. Comedian Larry Wilmore made references to the meme in his April 2016 routine at the White House Correspondents' Dinner, including a joke that Cruz was not campaigning to win the nomination, but to continue a murder spree. The meme has been repeated, without disclaimer, in anti-Cruz opinion pieces in GQ and the Chicago Tribune. Reception Lindsey Martin, a Twitter user who helped circulate the meme, told NPR that she did so because it is \\"so obviously untrue... if there was any way that it could possibly be true I would be scared to joke about it just because of the repercussions.‚Äù The Verge writer Kaitlyn Tiffany opined that some may consider the subject of the meme to be \\"distasteful and irresponsible, even dangerous\\". Leigh Alexander considered its spread an example of the growing political engagement of youth, writing that in such memes, \\"the political figure is exaggerated, his context made grotesque or fantastical, just as in traditional political cartooning.\\" According to Lozano, the point of the meme is to \\"[demonize] his character\\". Heidi Cruz responded to the meme by stating that she has \\"been married to him for 15 years, and I know pretty well who he is, so it doesn't bother me at all. There's a lot of garbage out there\\". Ted Cruz acknowledged the meme on his official Twitter account on October 18, 2017, by tweeting an image of one of the Zodiac Killer's encrypted messages. He did so again on October 31 of the following year.

Loosely based on the real- life story of Sandeep Kaur, the film stars Kangana Ranaut as Praful Patel, a divorcee, who loses her savings in a gambling bout. She takes a loan in order to repair the damage but when she is unable to repay it, she finds herself drawn into a life of crime. Hiten Kumar, Kishori Shahane and Sohum Shah are featured in supporting roles. Simran was released worldwide on 15 September 2017. The film received mixed reviews, with critics widely praising Ranaut's performance but criticising the screenplay and execution. It became a moderate box office hit grossing ‚Çπ276.9 million against its ‚Çπ170 million budget, but was deemed a box office disappointment owing to Ranaut's star power. For her performance, Ranaut received nominations for the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress, and Screen Award for Best Actress.  Plot  Praful Patel (Kangana Ranaut) is a young divorcee who lives with her parents and works in the housekeeping department in one of the five-star hotels of Atlanta, Georgia, USA. She shares a bitter relationship with her dad who is always blaming her for her mistakes in the past, instead of giving her moral support; so now, Praful wants to move out and buy her own house. She has applied for a loan and her loan gets pre- approved. In the meantime, Praful decides to go with her cousin on a trip to Las Vegas (her cousin pays for all tickets and accommodations). In Las Vegas, she plays baccarat for the first time and wins big in her first few rounds. She quickly gets addicted to the game. The next day, she returns to the casino but ends up losing not only the money she won the previous day but a large chunk of her savings also. Praful then returns to Atlanta after a week, only to find out that her bank application to the bank has been rejected as her credit rating is very low. Praful seeks her father's help but he insists that she should meet a young man named Sameer (Sohum Shah) who has been selected as her suitor. After meeting with the suitor, she has mixed feelings about marriage and agrees to get engaged. However, her addiction to gambling takes a toll on her and Praful gives her last shot to gambling and goes back to Vegas. Unfortunately, she ultimately loses all her savings so a private money lender spots Praful (who is now drunk) in the casino and offers her money. The drunk Praful ‚Äì not in her right senses- takes $32,000 from the moneylender and in exchange gives him her driving license. Praful loses all that borrowed money (along with her hard-earned savings) and has to return penniless to her home. Praful tries to explain to her father her bad situation and needing his financial help, but in fear of retaliation and hostility, she is reluctant. Her parents want her to begin her wedding preparations and plans with Sameer, who by now gets impressed by her personality. At a relative's wedding, Praful and Sameer meet again and dance, and get to know each other. However, Praful is threatened by the loan sharks to pay within 10 days or face death, so she is disturbed and anxious, unable to concentrate on her wedding plans. Therefore, Praful develops the habit of stealing whereby first she disguises herself (wearing oversized sunglasses and a hood) and approaches a cashier at a gas station shop. She collects only $10,000 so she has to go and rob a bank (which she learns how to on YouTube), with a disguise, and hands a note written with red lipstick that says money should be given to her otherwise she will blow the whole bank as she is strapped to a bomb. Praful's second robbery gets foiled by a bank manager who bumps into her when she tries to rob the bank similarly. When the manager asks her name, Praful tells her name 'Simran', the name of a popular character from an Indian blockbuster film Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge which her mother ultimately watches often. Although Praful's plan to rob the bank gets foiled, she manages to escape and similarly robs another bank. Praful Patel has now become a most wanted criminal with the name 'Simran ‚Äì The Lipstick Bandit'. Despite robbing 3 to 4 banks successfully, Praful is still short of collecting fifty thousand dollars. Meanwhile, Praful develops a liking towards Sameer, and confides in him her bad habits of gambling and stealing which he does not take seriously, thinking it is some kind of a joke. Trouble comes back when loan sharks attack Praful in her hotel for the money and Praful's ex-boyfriend Mike ‚Äì the general manager of the hotel steals the money from her locker room and refuses to give the money back to her until and unless she submits to his sexual advances/desires. Praful ultimately hits him and gets suspended from the hotel, after which she tells the loan sharks that her money has been stolen. By now, these loan sharks know that Praful is actually 'Simran ‚Äì The Lipstick Bandit', so they ask her to rob one more bank and this time with a bigger amount‚Äîfor which they offer her a gun to finish the job. Devastated and dejected, Praful calls off her relationship with Sameer and asks him to leave and by telling him the truth. Enraged by this, Praful's father slaps her and asks her to leave his house. Praful leaves her home and stays with her best friend Salma (Esha Tewari) for a night. The next day Praful attacks the same bank that rejected her bank loan and flees the place after stealing the money. Sameer is still in love with Praful and to help her, he transfers a huge amount of fifty thousand dollars in her bank account. Praful, before leaving the city of Atlanta, calls him at a lonely place and tells him that he should find another girl, as he is a nice man and he deserves someone better; not someone like her. Sameer refuses and asks her to surrender to the police and end this dirty game once and for all; after which Praful's dad calls her and asks for forgiveness. Praful is happy at this and returns home but the police cars have surrounded her and are following her car to arrest her. Praful drives off because she did not want to get arrested in her neighbourhood, which is full of Indians, and her parents would be very ashamed of her there. The ultimate chase begins as Praful's car is found empty by the police. Praful had taken a taxi and was almost near the airport, but then she decides to surrender on a lonely highway. She asks the taxi to stop at the curbside and then she calls 9‚Äì1‚Äì1 and surrenders herself. After her arrest, there is a trial whereby the judge adjudicates Praful to be imprisoned for 10 months, but she is released after 3‚Äì4 months due to good behaviour. Her ex-boyfriend Mike is also imprisoned for stealing her money and also for his sexual advance. During a meeting session in prison, Praful tells her father that she wants to invest all his money into the stock market. Enraged by this, Praful's father becomes angry and grabs her neck angrily, venting his frustration that all his hard-earned money will blow up in smoke due to her crazy intentions.

In 1870, Townsend's work was included in the first art exhibition held in Christchurch, staged by the Canterbury Provincial Council and held at a temporary annex of the Canterbury Museum. Fellow settler Charlotte Godley commissioned Townsend to paint a portrait of her husband John Godley, the Chief Agent of the Canterbury Association, and another of their infant son, Arthur. The portrait of Arthur Godley is in the collection of Canterbury Museum, while the Christchurch Art Gallery holds the painting of John Godley.

Characteristics Netto-uyoku generally express support for historically revisionist views, portraying Imperial Japan in a positive light, juxtaposed with a negative portrayal of China (anti- Chinese sentiment), North and South Korea (Anti-Korean sentiment), who opposed Japan's actions prior to and during World War II. Netto-uyoku tend to express hostility towards immigrants from other countries, particularly Zainichi Koreans, and encourage visits by conservative politicians to the Yasukuni Shrine.

Furuya Tsunehira, who writes about the netto-uyoku, makes the observation that although active on the web, they lack institutional political representation offline, leading to a sense of frustration and a tendency to be more active online and to back the more right-wing elements of the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan, especially the Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's administration as a substitute for having a party of their own.

It typically includes a few (one to five) panels, and a simple joke premised on Ot's use of magic. Text only appears when the strip's characters can read it, or as an onomatopoeia, such as to indicate a spell has been cast. Plot and characters The main character is Ot, a wizard dressed in black, who fixes problems with his magic. Sometimes, his magic serves to help others, but it is often used instead to prank other people (especially characters who are rich, strong, or powerful). Other recurring characters include: * The owl: typically an observer of the comic's goings-on, but sometimes the butt of Ot's pranks. * Ot's wife, Berta: egocentric and temperamental, she is always demanding he do things for her, and often ends up chasing him with a broom to hit him over the head with. She has no powers. * A policeman: often chases Ot because of his tricks, but never catches him. * The thief: always trying to steal something from Ot's house or from another place, but Ot or his wife are always there to stop him. * The castaway: he is always on a tiny island wishing for something, which Ot gives him as he flies by on his broom. Many of the characters dress in an antiquated manner, but references to the modern world often appear. These don't have to be considered as anachronisms if one considers that Ot has the ability to time travel.  History  The character Ot appeared for the first time in the double number 215/216 of Cavall Fort, a Catalan-language children's magazine, in 1971. The strip has appeared uninterruptedly in the magazine ever since. In celebration of the 40-year anniversary of the character in 2009, Norma Editorial published the first of three volumes of the strip's comics.Picanyol Ot, el bruixot.3 vol. Barcelona: Norma 2009-2011 vol.1: 9788498476149, vol.2: 9788467900958, vol.3: 9788467904888 The publishers continued to publish volumes through 2011, with the intention of collecting all the comic strips of Ot.Picanyol Ot, el bruixot.3 vol.  The stories of Ot, el bruixot  Other stories featuring Ot include a number of collections published by the Editorial Pirene in both Catalan and Spanish, as well as a collection called Ot, el bruixot published by the Editorial La Galera.

Life Max Herz was born into a family of limited means. His father made a living from agriculture. Max Herz finished his primary and secondary schooling in Temesv√°r [now Timi≈üoara, Romania]. He studied architecture under Alajos Hauszmann in Budapest (Technical University; 1874‚Äì1877) and under Henrich von Ferstel and Carl K√∂nig in Vienna (Technical College; 1877‚Äì1880).On Hauszmann, see J√≥zsef Sisa: Alajos Hauszmann.

After his final examinations he undertook a long journey through Italy, which also took him to Egypt in the autumn of 1880. Quite unexpectedly, Julius Franz Pasha, the head of the Technical Office of the Waqf Ministry (‚âàMinistry of Religious Affairs) offered Herz a job in Cairo. He accepted, and joined the office, which was also responsible for the conservation of mosques. As chief architect to the Comit√© de Conservation des Monuments de l'Art Arabe, he directed the conservation of monuments of Arab-Islamic and Coptic architecture all over Egypt, first of all in Cairo from 1890 until the end of 1914. Upon the outbreak of World War I, at the end of 1914, Herz, a Hungarian citizen, was forced into retirement and expelled from the country as an enemy alien by the British authorities; though officially an autonomous province of the Ottoman Empire with special rights, Egypt had been under British military occupation from 1882 on. Leaving all his possessions behind, he went to Milan with his family, where the relatives of his Italian wife lived. As he had to stay in a neutral country in order to receive his pension from Egypt, he moved on to Zurich after Italy declared war on her ally, the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, on 23 May 1915. The world in which he had lived collapsed. The sudden death of his son (17) in the autumn of 1914 was a great blow, from which he never really recovered and which considerably aggravated his situation. The man, who had been full of optimism all his life, gradually broke. He developed a gastric illness and died during an operation. In accordance with his wish, he lies buried in the grave he himself designed for his son in Milan (Cimitero Monumentale). When his widow died in 1949, she was buried next to them.Istv√°n Ormos: Max Herz Pasha 1856‚Äì1919. His life and career. (√âtudes Urbaines 6/1-2). Institut Fran√ßais d'Arch√©ologie Orientale, Cairo, 2009, pp. 1‚Äì48, 481‚Äì484. . Activities =Conservation of monuments= In the 19th century, the state of preservation of Arab-Islamic monuments in Egypt deteriorated rapidly. In order to counteract this process, Khedive Tawfƒ´q founded the Comit√© de Conservation des Monuments de l'Art Arabe in 1881. In it Max Herz inherited the seat of the retiring Franz Pasha in 1887 and from 1890 filled the post of chief architect, which was expressly created for him.On the Comit√© and its activities, see Achille Patricolo: La conservation des monuments arabes en √âgypte. Roditi, Cairo, 1914. Alaa El- Habashi: Athar to monuments: The interventions of the Comit√© de Conservation des Monuments de l'Art Arabe. PhD diss., University of Pennsylvania, 2001. Philipp Speiser: Die Geschichte der Erhaltung arabischer Baudenkm√§ler in √Ñgypten. (Abhandlungen des Deutschen Arch√§ologischen Instituts Kairo, Islamische Reihe, 8). Heidelberger Orientverlag, Heidelberg, 2001, pp. 47‚Äì94. . The Comit√©'s president was ex officio the waqf minister; however, the actual direction of affairs lay in the hands of the chief architect. Decisions were taken collectively in the sessions of the Comit√©, which consisted partly of Egyptian and partly of European members. However, on account of his qualification, experience, the devotion to his job, his capacity for work and last but not least his position, Herz played a decisive role in the Comit√©, which soon extended the sphere of its activities to monuments of Coptic architecture too. (The preservation of monuments of ancient Egyptian [pharaonic] architecture was the task of a different government agency.) Max Herz filled this post for a quarter of a century (1890‚Äì1914), and in this capacity he played an outstanding role in the preservation of monuments of Arab-Islamic and Coptic architecture. We are indebted to him for the survival of a number of monuments, while in the case of restored monuments it was he who more or less determined the form in which they appear today. His outstanding achievements along with his amiable personality won him general recognition; his activities are regarded as exemplary to this very day. Herz followed the method of \\"stylistic restoration\\". It meant ridding a monument of later additions of low quality and restoring it to its original, most splendid, even ideal shape, \\"which may never have existed at any given time\\" (Viollet-le-Duc).[Eug√®ne-Emmanuel] Viollet-le-Duc: Dictionnaire raisonn√© de l'architecture fran√ßaise du XIe au XVIe si√®cle. B. Bance, A. Morel, Paris, 1858‚Äì1868, VIII [1866], p. 14. The other extreme approach to architectural preservation demanded the avoidance of any sort of restoration or reconstruction; only the preservation of the monument in its actually existing shape was permitted, without any additions.Jokka Jokilehto: A history of architectural conservation. Butterworth-Heinemann, Oxford, 1999, pp. 137‚Äì244. . Herz was a believer in stylistic restoration but practised it with moderation, good taste and common sense. This approach was determined in part by the chronic lack of funds at the Comit√©'s disposal, which did not allow complete restoration on a large scale. At a very early stage the Comit√© decided that its foremost task was to secure the survival of the greatest possible number of monuments, which children of a happier and richer age would subject to complete restoration.Philipp Speiser: Die Geschichte der Erhaltung arabischer Baudenkm√§ler in √Ñgypten. (Abhandlungen des Deutschen Arch√§ologischen Instituts Kairo, Islamische Reihe, 8). Heidelberger Orientverlag, Heidelberg, 2001, pp. 68‚Äì70. . The minaret of Qadi Yahya Zayn al-Din's mosque before and after restoration. The upper part was reconstructed on the basis of analogy because no information was available on its original shape. In Herz's practice \\"stylistic purity\\" meant that in the case of periods whose architecture was well known owing to the existence of numerous monuments, he regarded as permissible the analogical reconstruction of structures whose original shape was unknown. This was the case with the mosques from the Late or Circassian Mamluk period, which was represented with numerous splendid mosques in Cairo, the exquisite minarets of which, for instance, were in many cases damaged on account of their fragility. On the other hand, the architecture of the Fatimid period was little known, therefore he left the ugly late replacement of the original minaret of the Aqmar Mosque (519/1125) untouched when he restored it, because he had no information regarding its original shape and knew very little about Fatimid minarets in general.The low quality structure was added in 1397 or 1412.

(His successors exercised considerably less self-restraint in the reconstruction of the Fatimid mosque of al-Salih Talai (555/1160), about the original shape of which they possessed only very scanty information.)Keppel Archibald Cameron Creswell: The Muslim architecture of Egypt. [Clarendon, Oxford, 1952‚Äì1959; reprint:] Hacker Art Books, New York, 1978, vol. I, pp. 275‚Äì288; pl. 97-108. The replacement of missing structures (e.g., fountain, pulpit) as required by \\"stylistic restoration\\" was an urgent necessity from a practical viewpoint in the case of mosques, irrespective of whether their original shape was known or not, because religious observation was to be resumed in them after the completion of restoration by the Comit√©.See Istv√°n Ormos: Preservation and restoration.

Analogical reconstructions by Herz, because no information was available on their original shape. There is a continuous debate going on about the theory and practice of architectural conservation all over the world, in which various, widely differing views and standpoints are voiced, often depending on the given circumstances.See, e.g., John H. Stubbs: Time honored. A global view of architectural conservation. Parameters, theory, and evolution of an ethos. John Wiley and Sons, Hoboken, New Jersey, 2009. In its theory and practice the Comit√© followed the latest standards represented in the Western world. The method adopted by the Comit√© under Herz Pasha is regarded as exemplary and is actually followed in the practice of conservation in Egypt to our very day. It is only natural that conflicting views are also voiced in such a complex question, especially given the circumstance that in the period under discussion the Comit√© functioned in a country under British occupation. The Comit√©'s activities were characterized by a high-level professionalism, thoroughness and devotion. Nairy Hampikian wrote when she completed the restoration of Bab Zuwayla (485/1092), one of the Fatimid gates of the medieval city: \\"I have deliberately included many minor details in the recapitulation of these activities of the Comit√©, because I believe they will help counter hasty conceptual and political judgments on its activities. ... The love and care which was transmitted to these monuments through the work of the Comit√©, the meticulous professionalism by which its members worked, and the sincerity of their efforts is often underappreciated. Furthermore, the degree of seriousness with which these people approached their work is only really apparent when one follows its line of thinking with regard to a single structure over a number of years.\\"Nairy Hampikian: Medievalization of the Old City as an ingredient of Cairo's modernization: Case study of Bab Zuwayla. In: Making Cairo medieval. Ed. Nezar AlSayyad, Irene A. Bierman, Nasser Rabbat. Lexington Books, Lanham-Boulder-New York-Toronto-Oxford, 2005, p. 222. . The Comit√© carefully documented its activities. This documentation has survived; its scholarly investigation has begun. The Comit√© published an annual Bulletin in French about its activities; they were also translated into Arabic.A nearly complete series is accessible on the internet now: Monuments completely restored by HerzFor a detailed treatment of Herz's activities in the field of architectural conservation, see Istv√°n Ormos: Max Herz Pasha 1856‚Äì1919.

In 1880 Khedive Tawfiq entrusted Julius Franz Pasha with the foundation of the Arab Museum (at present: Museum of Islamic Arts). In 1892 the Comit√© put Herz in charge of the museum, and in 1902 he was appointed director. This happened in connection with the inauguration of the new museum building designed by Alfonso Manescalco. Until then the museum collections were housed in temporary buildings in the ruinous al-Hakim mosque (380-403/990-1013); the post of director did not exist.On the Museum, see Min dhakirat Mathaf al-Fann al- Islami 1881m-2010m. Mugallad wathaiqi tadhkari. Al-id al-miawi. Al-Maglis al- Aala li-l-Athar, Cairo, 2010. . Herz published the museum's catalogue in French in two editions; both were translated into English and the second edition also appeared in Arabic translation.See the list of Herz's publications below. In addition to descriptions of the objects, they contain a concise account of the history of Arab-Islamic art according to the fields represented in the museum's collections and thus they still possess eminent scholarly value on a general level. =The Foundation of the Coptic Museum= According to the current narrative the Coptic Museum in Old Cairo was founded by Marcus Simayka Pasha (1864‚Äì1944), an outstanding public figure in the Coptic community, a passionate lover of Coptic art, who subsequently held the post of director until the end of his life.On Marcus Simayka Pasha, see the biography by his grandson, which also contains the current narrative about the foundation of the Coptic Museum: Samir Mahfouz Simaika: Marcus Pasha Simaika. Founder of the Coptic Museum. His life and times, Farid Atiya Press, Gizeh, 2011. . There can be no doubt that it was owing to his high competence, unflagging zeal and self-sacrificing efforts exerted in the course of long decades that the Coptic Museum evolved into the flourishing scholarly institution of world renown that we know today. However, as far as its foundation is concerned, contemporary documents do not seem to support the current narrative. In the most authentic version, which Simayka Pasha jotted down decades after the event, he describes in detail the circumstances under which he founded the museum in 1908 with the aim of saving valuable silver liturgical vessels which Patriarch Cyril V wanted to sell and when upon his suggestion the Patriarch assigned a room for the storage of objects of Coptic art worthy of preservation.The relevant section of Simayka's unpublished memoirs is quoted in Donald Malcolm Reid: Archeology, social reform, and modern identity among the Copts (1854‚Äì1952). In: Entre reforme sociale et mouvement national. Identit√© et modernisation en √âgypte (1882‚Äì1962). Ed. A. Roussillon. CEDEJ, Cairo, 1995, p. 311. . However, it is recorded in the Comit√© Bulletins that the Patriarch assigned the room in question ten years earlier, and that upon Herz Pasha's request, when in his capacity of chief architect of the Comit√© Herz addressed an official letter on this subject to the Minister of Public Works and Public Education, Husayn Fakhri Pasha, which was read in the Comit√©'s session on 4 January 1898.Comit√© Bulletin 15, 1898, pp. 4‚Äì6. http://www.islamic-art.org/Comitte/BArchViewPage.asp?BookID=699&PO;=7 Arabic translation: http://www.islamic- art.org/Comitte/BArchViewPage.asp?BookID=700&PO;=7 In the Comit√©'s name, Herz and another Comit√© member, Hanna Bey Bakhum of the Coptic community, started discussions with the Patriarch, who subsequently assigned a room in the complex of the Muallaqa church (3rd c. AD) for this purpose. (Simayka Pasha was not a member of the Comit√© at that time.) Thus Herz must be regarded as the museum's founder. Herz's role is acknowledged by Gallini Fahmi (Qallini Fahmi) Pasha, an outstanding Coptic public servant, who served five sovereigns in his exceptionally long life and who always carefully followed events in the life of the Coptic community. In his memoirs written in the 1930s he pays great tribute to the achievements and boundless merits of Marcus Simayka Pasha in the unsurpassed development of the museum; nevertheless he explicitly names Herz as its founder.Qallini Fahmi Basha: Mudhakkirat. Matbaat al-Muqtataf wa- l-Muqattam, Cairo, 1934, vol. I, pp. 123‚Äì125. Gallini Fahmi Pacha: Souvenirs du Kh√©dive Isma√Øl au Kh√©dive Abbas II. Editions de la Patrie, Cairo, n.d., pp. 129‚Äì131. Elsewhere Marcus Simayka himself mentions another date and different circumstances: in 1920 and in 1929 he wrote that he had undertaken this step around 1895 and under completely different conditions.(Murqus Simayka:) Note historique sur le Mus√©e copte au Vieux Caire √† l'occasion de la visite de Sa Hautesse Fouad Ier, Sultan d'√âgypte, mardi, 21 d√©cembre 1920. S.n., Cairo, n.d. [1920], pp. 4‚Äì5. Murqus Simayka: Le Mus√©e copte au Vieux Caire. L'Art vivant en √âgypte 5, 1929, no. 98 (15 January 1929), p. 62. He never mentions Herz's letter of 1898 and the subsequent events. It seems that the museum's case made only little progress in the years before World War I and that real development ensued after the end of the war, under the directorship of Marcus Simayka Pasha, when the museum received a separate building of its own. It deserves to be mentioned that Herz's office prepared some plans for the building of the future Coptic Museum under his guidance in the years before the war but ultimately different plans were used. On a personal level, Herz and Simayka were on excellent, even confidential terms. In his memoirs Simayka expresses very positive views about Herz in his discussion of the Comit√© but never mentions him in connection with the Coptic Museum.A detailed analysis of the sources together with further bibliographical references can be found in Istv√°n Ormos: Max Herz Pasha 1856‚Äì1919. His life and career. (√âtudes Urbaines 6/1-2), Institut Fran√ßais d'Arch√©ologie Orientale, Cairo, 2009, pp. 98, 334‚Äì346. . =The private architect= Herz was also active as a private architect in Cairo, though we know little about his achievements in this field. The author of his Arabic obituary, who consulted his former colleagues and subordinates, mentions more than 150 buildings in Cairo in various styles: mainly in \\"the Arab style\\", but also in western styles, among others in the Gothic style.Tawfiq Iskarus: Maks Hirts Basha wa-fadluhu fi hifz al-athar al- arabiyya. Al-Hilal 27, 1919, no. 10 (July 1919) p. 924. While this number cannot be regarded as inordinately high for the whole oeuvre of an architect ‚Äì the Hungarian architect J√≥zsef Hild designed 917 buildings in the course of his career ‚Äì, this number should be treated with reservation: Herz's unusually heavy workload in the Comit√© would not have left him much spare time and it is problematic too that only a few of them are known. Herz does not mention this subject in surviving documents. The biographies written by his wife after his death mention no more than a few buildings. The Villa Zogheb.The Villa Gianaclis when it housed the newly founded Egyptian University as tenant. Postcard 1909. In 1919 the villa was acquired by the American University in Cairo. Herz's name is closely connected to the \\"neo-Mamluk style\\". This architectural style, which was born in the context of the so-called neo-styles within the historicism then fashionable in Europe, revives the memory of the architecture of the Mamluk period, which saw Egypt as the greatest power in the Middle East and North Africa, with Cairo as her capital, a resplendent metropolis which had no equal in the known world. This style, which conjured up the memory of the country's glorious past, quickly became popular in Egypt, where it acquired the status of a national architectural style within the theoretical framework of a burgeoning nationalism.See Nasser Rabbat: The formation of the Neo-Mamluk style in modern Egypt. In: The education of the architect. Historiography, urbanism, and the growth of architectural knowledge. Essays presented to Stanford Anderson. Ed. Martha Pollak. MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1997, pp. 363‚Äì386. Herz was regarded as the foremost authority on this style, although he had not invented it.Tawfiq Iskarus: Maks Hirts Basha wa-fadluhu fi hifz al-athar al-arabiyya. Al-Hilal 27, 1919, no. 10 (July 1919) p. 924. (The expression \\"Arab style\\" above refers to this style.) In this style he erected the sumptuous palace of Count Zogheb, the consul of Denmark, in Qasr al-Nil Street; it was demolished in the 1960s.Gaetano Moretti: La villa Zogheb in Cairo. Due parole sull'architettura moderna in Egitto. L'Edilizia moderna 12 (1903) pp. 1‚Äì3, pl. I-II. In the same quarter stood a palace which its new owner, the tobacco manufacturer Nestor Gianaclis, decided to have remodelled in the neo-Mamluk style, entrusting the task to Max Herz in 1898. The beautifully remodelled neo-Mamluk palace was acquired by the newly founded American University in Cairo in 1919: it is still standing as one of the university's central buildings in Tahrir Square.Istv√°n Ormos: Max Herz Pasha 1856‚Äì1919. His life and career. (√âtudes Urbaines 6/1-2). Institut Fran√ßais d'Arch√©ologie Orientale, Cairo, 2009, pp. 404‚Äì408. . In a similar vein, the Rifai mosque also represents the neo-Mamluk style. Its construction began around 1870 by the order of Khushyar hanim, the pious mother of Khedive Ismail, according to plans prepared by the Egyptian architect Husayn Fahmi. Work stopped around 1880 due to technical problems and a shortage of funds. A quarter of a century later, in 1906, Khedive Abbas II Hilmi entrusted Max Herz with the completion of the gigantic edifice opposite the grandiose mosque of Sultan Hasan (757-764/1356-1362). As far as possible, Herz strove to follow the ideas of the architect, to whom he had been connected by personal ties too, but in many cases he had to rely upon his own expertise and invention because the original plans were not extant and in many cases the concepts of the architect were not known. The completion of the superb mosque, which also served as the burial place of members of the Khedivial family, represented a great personal and professional success for Max Herz. It was in connection with this work that the Khedive promoted him to the next grade in the civil service.Max Herz: La mosqu√©e el-Rifa√Ø au Caire. Humbert Allegretti, Milan, n.d. [1911]. http://www.islamic- art.org/OnlineBooks/BArchViewPage.asp?BookID=747&PO;=1#viewpage ; https://archive.org/stream/lamosqueelrifa00herz#page/n9/mode/2up . As holder of one of the top grades, he became entitled to use the honorary title \\"Pasha\\" from then on; until then he used the honorary title \\"Bey\\". Interior of the Rifai mosque.The building of the Cr√©dit Foncier √âgyptien. Vague neo-Mamluk references could be detected on his own villa, which was built according to his own designs at 19 Shaykh Barakat (now Kamal al-Din Salah) Street behind Tahrir Square; the villa was demolished long ago. Herz built the head office of the former Cr√©dit Foncier √âgyptien on the corner of today's Abd al-Khaliq Tharwat and Muhammad Bey Farid Streets in downtown Cairo in the Beaux-Arts style following the designs of Carlo Prampolini. The building is still standing. In cooperation with Anton Battigelli, in 1898 Herz carried out extension work on the building of the Austro-Hungarian \\"Rudolf\\" Hospital (Ospedale Rodolfo in contemporary parlance) in the Abbasiyya quarter (9a Sharia al-Masud off Midan Abduh Basha). The building, of modest quality, has been remodelled several times since; in 1997 it was the property of the Faggala Evangelical Church and housed an outpatients' clinic, a vocational training centre, a Christian club and offices.Rudolf Agstner: Das √∂sterreichisch-ungarische Rudolf-Spital (‚ÄûOspedale Rodolfo\\") in Kairo. (Schriften des √ñsterreichischen Kulturinstitutes Kairo, 8). √ñsterreichisches Kulturinstitut, Cairo, 1995. . The \\"Cairo Street\\" at the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago was designed by Max Herz and he also supervised the final stage of its erection on the spot. It was not the copy of any street actually in existence in Cairo but an architectural complex made of temporary materials modelled on typical Cairene buildings or parts of them to evoke the atmosphere of the Middle-Eastern metropolis. In order to enhance the authenticity of the Street, a great number of typical inhabitants of Cairo as well as animals (camels, donkeys and snakes) were also brought to Chicago to populate the complex. The idea was not new; it represented a project type which was popular at the time. Nor was it the first Cairo Street at world's expositions. However, what made it unique as compared to its counterparts was the high level of the designs and the execution. The public loved it; it was generally regarded as the most popular project at the World's Columbian Exposition.Istv√°n Ormos: The Cairo Street at the World's Columbian Exposition, Chicago, 1913.

Major publications Cairo Street at the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago. Max Herz was an outstanding historian of architecture but his heavy workload at the Comit√© did not allow him to develop his capacities in this field to the level of his abilities and desires. At the same time, all his publications are worthy of our attention, because they were written by a highly gifted and well educated specialist who lived among the monuments of Cairo over the course of 35 years, in everyday contact and continuous interaction with them. He subjected many of them to interventions of varying degrees, ranging from thorough examination to complete reconstruction. Thus he was privileged to acquire a wealth of information and grasp of the whole field such as was unique among his contemporaries. This means that even his shortest articles may contain important data unobtainable elsewhere. In the following we list his most important publications accompanied by annotations:For a complete bibliography of Herz Pasha's publications, see Istv√°n Ormos: Max Herz Pasha 1856‚Äì1919. His life and career. (√âtudes Urbaines 6/1-2). Institut Fran√ßais d'Arch√©ologie Orientale, Cairo, 2009, pp. 524‚Äì535. . Title page of the monograph on Sultan Hasan's mosque.Title page of the Arabic edition of the monograph on Sultan Hasan's mosque. #With the aim of launching an early type of \\"media campaign\\" to pave the way for the complete reconstruction of one of the most important monuments of Arab-Islamic architecture in Cairo and perhaps in the whole Islamic world, in 1899 he published a folio-size monograph on the mosque of Sultan Hasan (757-764/1356-1362). It retains its importance to this day: #*Max Herz: La mosqu√©e du Sultan Hassan au Caire. Institut Fran√ßais d'Arch√©ologie Orientale, Cairo, 1899 ; http://www.islamic-art.org/OnlineBooks/index.asp ; in 1902 an Arabic translation came out, which was republished in diminished size in Cairo in 2009. #He devoted a seminal monograph, which appeared posthumously, to one of the most interesting and remarkable architectural monuments in Cairo, the complex of Sultan Qalaun (683-684/1284-1285; mausoleum, madrasa-mosque, hospital): #*Max Herz: Die Baugruppe des SultƒÅns QalƒÅ≈´n in Kairo. (Abhandlungen des Hamburgischen Kolonialinstituts 42, Reihe B. V√∂lkerkunde, Kulturgeschichte und Sprachen, 22), L. Friederichsen, Hamburg, 1919. https://archive.org/stream/diebangruppedess00herzuoft#page/n5/mode/2up ; In view of his long involvement with this splendid complex there was truly nobody more qualified to write a monograph on it, yet the circumstances of its genesis prevented him from accomplishing this task in accordance with his gifts and abilities. He wrote it in exile in Switzerland, without access to the Comit√© archives, its library and collection of photographs, his own papers and photographs, and he was deprived of the blessings of a good specialist library also. #His succinct account of the history of Arab-Islamic art in Hungarian can still be perused with great profit. He concentrates on the art of Cairo, subsequently extending his view towards the distant horizons of the Islamic world: #*Herz Miksa: Az Iszl√°m m≈±v√©szete [The art of Islam], A m≈±v√©szetek t√∂rt√©nete a legr√©gibb id≈ëkt≈ël a XIX. sz√°zad v√©g√©ig [The history of the arts from the earliest times until the end of the 19th century], ed.

They constitute a succinct data store on the Arab-Islamic and Coptic architecture of Egypt and especially of Cairo. In 1914 Herz also published an index to volumes 1882‚Äì1910, thus rendering a great service to readers in providing them with relatively easy access to this invaluable source, which is otherwise very difficult to use; a similar index to later volumes never appeared:The Bulletins are difficult to use because data on single monuments are scattered in various volumes, as is usually the case with journals of this kind. In addition, several monuments were known by different names, which were often used interchangeably. For the preservation of monuments in subsequent years the following publication can now be consulted: Nicholas Warner: The monuments of Historic Cairo. A map and descriptive catalogue. (American Research Center in Egypt Conservation Series, 1; An American Research Center in Egypt Edition). The American University in Cairo Press, Cairo‚ÄìNew York, 2005. . However, it is not exhaustive in this respect. Therefore it does not replace a full index. #*Max Herz: Index g√©n√©ral des Bulletins du Comit√© des ann√©es 1882 √† 1910. Institut Fran√ßais d'Arch√©ologie Orientale, Cairo, 1914. A (nearly) complete series of the Bulletins, including the Index, is accessible on the internet now: https://web.archive.org/web/20130910024306/http://islamic- art.org/comitte/Comite.asp Hungarian connections Max Herz had close connections with Hungary throughout his life; he visited his native country several times. He kept his Hungarian citizenship until his death. He could have retained his office and remained in Egypt if he had renounced his Hungarian citizenship following the outbreak of World War I. He regarded Egypt as his second homeland (\\"ma seconde patrie\\")Comit√© Bulletin 32 (1915‚Äì1919), pt. I, pp. 327‚Äì328. and devoted all his active life to her, yet it was inconceivable for him to sever the most important bond between him and his native country. Herz left Hungary for good at the age of 21 ‚Äì of course he was not aware of this at the time ‚Äì, so one might not have been surprised if the memory of his native country had faded in his mind over the long decades he spent away from home. However, it was not so: he remained a proud Hungarian patriot throughout his life. When he died, his wife wrote about his illness and death in the emotional style of the period: \\"The silent struggle lasted four years and a half. Looking death straight in the face with noble calmness of mind, he remained to his last breath a caring husband, a tender father to his daughters, and a true son ‚Äì consumed by sorrow and grief ‚Äì of his dearly beloved Hungarian fatherland.\\"\\"Vierundhalb Jahre dauerte der stille Kampf. Dem Tode mit edler Gelassenheit ins Auge schauend, blieb er bis zum letzten Atemzug der sorgende Gatte, der z√§rtliche Vater seiner T√∂chter, der sich in Kummer und Sorge zehrende, treue Sohn seines hei√ügeliebten ungarischen Vaterlandes.\\" Herz Pasha's biography by his wife dated 5 May 1919, quoted in Istv√°n Ormos: Max Herz Pasha 1856‚Äì1919. His life and career. (√âtudes Urbaines 6/1-2). Institut Fran√ßais d'Arch√©ologie Orientale, Cairo, 2009, pp. 498‚Äì502. . (The \\"sorrow and grief\\" refer to Herz Pasha's anxiety about Hungary's fate under the Hungarian Soviet Republic [ 21 March to 1 August 1919] and the impending territorial losses resulting from Hungary's defeat in World War I.)Istv√°n Ormos: Max Herz Pasha 1856‚Äì1919. His life and career. (√âtudes Urbaines 6/1-2). Institut Fran√ßais d'Arch√©ologie Orientale, Cairo, 2009, pp. 34, 503‚Äì504. . He had close connections with Hungarian institutions, above all with the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and the Museum of Applied Arts. The former elected him external member in 1896, while to the latter he made important donations over the years.On Herz's donations to the museum, see Istv√°n Ormos: Max Herz Pasha 1856‚Äì1919. His life and career. (√âtudes Urbaines 6/1-2). Institut Fran√ßais d'Arch√©ologie Orientale, Cairo, 2009, pp. 514‚Äì520. . He cultivated his ties to Temesv√°r, where he spent his early youth and where his elder sister, Katalin lived, who had affectionately cared for him in his childhood after the untimely loss of their mother. Herz donated a number of pharaonic objects to the Historical and Archeological Museum of Southern Hungary in Temesv√°r (since 1920 Banat Museum [Muzeul Banatului], Timi≈üoara, Romania).On Herz's donations to the museum, see Istv√°n Ormos: Max Herz Pasha 1856‚Äì1919. His life and career. (√âtudes Urbaines 6/1-2). Institut Fran√ßais d'Arch√©ologie Orientale, Cairo, 2009, p. 521. . Not all ancient Egyptian objects in the museum come from Herz: e.g. the famous crocodile mummy was a donation of Istv√°n Berkeszi. The letters which he wrote to his friend Ignaz Goldziher (Budapest) from his exile in Switzerland show an increased affection and nostalgia for Hungary.These letters are preserved in the Library of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (\\"Goldziher Correspondence\\") and can be accessed through the library catalogue. Herz submitted articles to Hungarian journals (Budapesti Szemle [Budapest Review], M≈±v√©szi Ipar [Applied Art]) and published one of his major works, an account of the history of Islamic art, in Hungarian (see \\"Major publications, 3\\"). Franz Joseph, Emperor of Austria and King of Hungary, conferred two orders upon Herz. In 1912, the Hungarian Government initiated the official procedure of raising Herz to Hungarian nobility in recognition of his eminent services. The process was halted by the outbreak of World War I.On the details, see Istv√°n Ormos: Max Herz Pasha 1856‚Äì1919. His life and career. (√âtudes Urbaines 6/1-2).

In the summer of 2015, Lee signed a worldwide record deal with London-based record label, Loosehttps://blog.thecurrent.org/2015/07/frankie-lee-signs-with-loose-music/. On October 2, 2015, Lee's first full-length album, American Dreamer, was released in the Europehttps://www.loosemusic.com/frankielee/frankie-lees- debut-album-american-dreamer-is-out-today. Both in the studio and during live performances, Lee has been accompanied by Michael Lewis, Andrew Bird, JT Bates, Jacob Hanson, Jeremy Hanson, and Mike Rossetto. Early life At the age of twelve, Lee inherited his father's record collection and an acoustic guitar. He spent days and nights teaching himself to play along to folk, country, and western records. Lee cites the music of Bob Dylan and Hank Williams as motivators to start writing his own material. Raised in bars by his father's friends and uncle (Johnny Vincent), Lee started performing on stage in his early teens. Slim Dunlap and Curtiss A were mentors and would take the time to show him songs and invite him on stage to play and sing with their bands. Influenced by Nirvana, The Dead Milkmen, Tom Petty and Lucinda Williams. Lee began his own musical career in local bars, playing four-hour cover sets under the name Clyde. The band was composed of high school friends Brendan Kane and Sam Rockwell. Lee graduated high school in 2000 and left for college in Wisconsin on a full soccer scholarship. After his third semester in college, Lee talked his coach into letting him take out his scholarship money to \\"go west\\". Lee lived in Austin, Texas, Los Angeles, Tulsa, Nashville, Milwaukee, and Minneapolis. Career In early 2001, Lee moved to Austin to study the craft of his favorite writers and storytellers at the time. Eventually he settled into east Austin working for Townes Van Zandt's son (JT) while recording his first demos on Joe Ely's 4 track recorder. He passed around tapes to what would land him local bookings and a following of like minded musicians in the up-and-coming folk/americana scene. After almost 7 years in Austin, urban development and gentrification pushed him further away from the city center. Lee decide to move to Buda, Texas where he could focus more of his time on writing and recording his own music. Working at a horse stable by day to cover his rent, he would commute to the city on motorcycle by night. In the fall of 2008, feeling his time in Austin was coming to an end, Lee threw one last get together at Polvos Mexican restaurant and the Longbranch Inn and decided to move to Los Angeles the next day. Once in Los Angeles, Lee booked shows opening for Dawes. While living in a warehouse in Downtown Los Angeles, Lee was immersed in a scene of DIY musicians, and performed with the Allah-Las, Cass McCombs, Jonathan Wilson, and Farmer Dave. After returning home in the fall of 2010, Lee started recording songs that would become for his Middle West EP. The EP sold over 2,000 copies at the Minneapolis record store Electric Fetus. In early 2015, Lee signed a record deal with London-based label, Loose, and released his first full-length record, American Dreamer. The album was released in the United States in the summer of 2016 through Loose and distributed by Thirty Tigers. Lee's second full-length record, Stillwater, was recorded at a makeshift studio in his mother's house in Stillwater, Minnesota and released in June 2019.Minnesota's nomadic songwriter Frankie Lee comes home for new album 'Stillwater'.

A refinement of CASA/IPTN CN-235, the N-245 is designed for greater passenger capacity and lower operating costs than the CN-235. The N-245 has a longer body, and a newer engine type, a T-tail and no ramp door. Design and development When President Joko Widodo took office on 20 October 2014, he ordered the revival of several Indonesian aircraft in order to boost the Indonesian economy, including the N250 which captured world attention in 1997. After the successful revival of the N219 aircraft, Indonesian Aerospace decided to make a better and larger aircraft, and chose the N-245, a 50-seat turboprop airliner, as the N219's successor. The airliner was named N-245 for \\"the spirit of 45\\", Indonesia's 1945 independence. The program to produce the N-245 began in 2016. Indonesian Aerospace also stated its intention to produce the N-270, the 70-seat version of the N-245 and the N-219. The design phase was to begin in 2017 and the first N-245 was to be done by 2020. The Indonesian government pledged to provide a total of $44 million to develop the aircraft. On 8 December 2016, the Indonesian Ministry of Industry opined that the N-245 and the (another turboprop aircraft to be built by Indonesian Aerospace) should be designated as Strategic National Projects. On 10 February 2017, the N-245 and the R-80 were added to the project list. Due to this decision, the government was to prioritize the development of both aircraft, and accelerate the production timetable, saying that both aircraft could make a first flight as soon as 2019. In July 2017, Indonesian Aerospace announced that it has entered into an agreement with Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) to collaborate in the development of N-245 and N-219. Under a Framework Agreement, the two organizations will work together on technical aspects as well marketing initiatives. TAI's portfolio includes licensed production of General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon jets, SIAI-Marchetti SF.260 trainers, Cougar AS-532 search and rescue (SAR), and the N235, which the N245 is based on. The collaboration is expected to facilitate the conversion of the N245 from an aircraft designed for lightweight transport into a cost-effective commuter airplane. Initial report specifically cited TAI's involvement in the conceptual design activities of the N245. Aside from the N245, the agreement also covered the joint development of a new medium- altitude, long-endurance (MALE) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that will have a capability to operate in an altitude of 40,000 feet.

At the following year's tournament, she scored her first try in the defeat against England. York's winning try against France at The Gnoll in the 2016 Women's Six Nations Championship for her 22nd cap for the national team was subsequently compared to that of Graham Price. Price had scored his try against the French on his debut in 1975. Nick Webb at BBC Sport Wales described York's try as \\"brilliant\\". York's try gave the team only their fourth victory against the French ever, and qualified them for the 2017 Women's Rugby World Cup. She currently plays for Ynysddu RFC and the Newport Gwent Dragons.

Biography Mason was born in Plymouth, England. As a young man he played with the local Tamar Valley jazz band, in which his father, Frank ‚ÄúPop‚Äù Mason, had played drums. His father and mother Gwen, ran the family soft drinks company Mason‚Äôs Minerals. At Kelly College, in Tavistock, Rod played the bugle with the cadet corps, after which he developed a keen interest in a spare valve trombone. He played this in his father‚Äôs band until the trumpet player left; Rod replaced him using a brass-band style cornet. From 1959 to 1960, Rod played briefly with the Cy Laurie band. In 1962, when Monty Sunshine left the Chris Barber band to form his own group, Sunshine hired Rod on the recommendation of Kenny Ball. In the mid-1960s after leaving Sunshine, he worked in the family business and played occasionally until a winning appearance on Hughie Green‚Äôs Opportunity Knocks TV talent show which led to a flood of offers. A facial paralysis forced him to use other mouthpieces, which allowed him to extend the range of his instrument. In 1965 he founded his own band, and from 1970 he played in the Acker Bilk's Paramount Jazz Band, before he founded a band together with Ian Wheeler in 1973. This was a band with musicians like Brian Lemon, Dick Wellstood or Bob Wilber. He recorded numerous recordings for the Reef label. From 1980 Mason played in the Dutch Swing College Band. In 1985 he founded Hot Five band, with which he released a number of albums for Timeless Records and regularly toured Europe. Mason is according to Digby Fairweather \\"a world-class trumpeter [...] with a phenomenal versatility, unlimited endurance and the frightening ability to sound like Louis Armstrong.\\" In later life he lived with his wife Ingrid in Kaarst, Germany.Rod Mason Obituary The Guardian Retrieved 5 June 2020. Personal life and death Rod had a keen interest in both motorcars and motorcycles which led to a separate career as a speedway rider. He represented Plymouth on cinder tracks all over the UK although, as a result, suffered many minor injuries which made him decide to remain with music. He played his last gig in Kaarst, Germany in December, 2016 and died three weeks later, after developing peritonitis and pneumonia. His son, Timmy, predeceased him. He is survived by Ingrid and his other son, Simon.

The bombing took place at 09:17 (UTC+3) in front of the police headquarters along the thoroughfare Prof. Dr. Muammer Aksoy Boulevard. 2 police personnel were killed and 22 people, consisting of 18 police personnel and 4 civilians, were injured. The perpetrator was also killed.  Background  The bombing occurred at a time when Turkey was targeted by successive bombings from Kurdish and Islamist organisations alike. The most recent bombing had occurred on 27 April in Bursa. Gaziantep Police had recently conducted a number of operations against active Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and ISIL cells in the city. According to reports in the Turkish media, Gaziantep Police had intelligence about such an attack that could be made to coincide with May 1st.  Bombing  The bombing took place around 10 metres away from the police headquarters, near Demokrasi Square where the governor's office, town hall, Kamil Ocak Stadium and a number of businesses are located. The area had been closed due to May Day and two vehicles reportedly entered the area by crossing through the barriers. The assailants opened fire on the security forces in the area with machine guns, and as the police responded and the car fled, a second car that followed was detonated. According to Arif Ekici, a member of parliament of the Republican People's Party representing Gaziantep, the death toll would have been much higher if not for a policeman who saw the incoming vehicle that carried the bomb and opened fire, alerting his colleagues in time. The policeman himself was killed in the attack. The glasses of the businesses and public buildings in the area were broken in the blast. The bombing has not been claimed yet. According to Habert√ºrk, the suspected perpetrator of the attack was the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), with the possible assailant being ƒ∞smail G√ºne≈ü, whose father was arrested. G√ºne≈ü was reportedly known to be an ISIL member and his psychological situation had reportedly deteriorated after the recent death of his mother.  Aftermath  The area of the bombing was completely cleared of pedestrians and traffic. Following the attack, May Day celebrations that were scheduled in the city were cancelled, as well as a basketball match scheduled between Royal Halƒ± Gaziantep and Fenerbah√ße in the city. A ban on broadcasting about the attack was put in place by Turkish authorities. Following the attack, police in the city called for vigilance about a possibility that an attack could be carried out using a fake ambulance.
